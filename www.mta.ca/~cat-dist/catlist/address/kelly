Please note that I am henceforth to be, not

kelly_m@maths.su.oz.au

but

kelly_m@maths.usyd.edu.au

and similarly for any other user in place of kelly_m; yet
the old address will be accepted for the forseeable future.

Max Kelly.

Please note that my old email address kelly_m@maths.su.oz.au is soon to
be obsolete, and should be replaced by maxk@maths.usyd.edu.au

I wish to repeat my advice that the email address maths@su.oz.au will
soon vanish, since some of my colleagues are still using it. My current 
address is

maxk@maths.usyd.edu.au

Similarly Bob Walters has the new address

bob@maths.usyd.edu.au

Max Kelly.
