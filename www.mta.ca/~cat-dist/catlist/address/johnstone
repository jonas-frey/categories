Dear All,

I have been unofficially informed that "pmms", which has
hitherto been an acceptable alias for "dpmms" in the
domain dpmms.cam.ac.uk, is liable to stop working at
some point in the near future. So, if you have my e-mail
address recorded as  <ptj@pmms.cam.ac.uk> , or anything
else containing the string "@pmms", please insert a "d" in it.

Peter Johnstone

P.S. -- The same applies to Martin Hyland, and to anyone else
you may know in this Department.
