Dear category theorists,

 I would like to inform you that my preprint with Japie Vermeulen,
"Proper maps of toposes", can now be obtained electronically from
<http://www.math.uu.nl/people/moerdijk/preprints.html>. (This paper
will eventually appear as an issue of the Memoirs of the AMS.)

With best wishes for the holidays,

Ieke Moerdijk.
