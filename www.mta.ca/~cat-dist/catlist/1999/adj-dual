Subject: question on functors adjoint to their dual

I am interested in the following situation: a contravariant functor
adjoint to its own dual, with the unit and counit being the same
morphism, but _not_ an iso.

The canonical example is the contravariant internal hom on a cartesian
(or just symmetric monoidal) closed category, [(_) -> A] for some
object A.

My question is: is this typical, or are there (interesting) examples
of such adjunctions that do not come from exponentials?

Thanks,

Hayo Thielecke

        I think it *is* typical:  if we call the functor in question  F ,
and if we write  J  for the unit object, then we should learn easily that
 F  will just be  [(_) -> F(J)] ,  i.e.,  F(J) itself will serve as your  A .
