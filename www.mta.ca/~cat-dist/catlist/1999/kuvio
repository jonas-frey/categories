Subject: ANNOUNCE: kuvio.tex - diagrams for dvips users

From: Anders Svensson <svensson@math.ubc.ca>

Since Kris has just announced a new version of XY-pic, allow me to offer up
my own diagram package for users of dvips.

The macros in kuvio.tex use PostScript embedded in \special control sequences
to rotate arrows from the horizontal. Features include:

 1. Input uses an alignment syntax not unlike some other packages.

 2. Rigid and flexible grids for vertex placement. (Warning for new users:
    \Diagram \endDiagram and \Dg \endDg behave quite differently.)

 3. Diagram compilation for improved performance.

 4. Diagram types allow one to customize the setup for a named class of
    diagrams.

 5. Almost every choice made by the macros in kuvio.tex is adjustable by
    the user.

 6. A labelling scheme for typesetting material on top of diagrams or
    included PostScript figures.

 7. Arrows can be attached to points on other arrows.

 8. Since arrows are rotated from the horizontal, anything which can
    be typeset horizontally can be used as an arrow in a diagram.
    New arrow types are easily defined. (For those who care about such
    things, there is a predefined type, To, whose arrowhead is that of
    \rightarrow .)

 9. General purpose macros for rotation, reflection and framing.

For anyone who's interested, the following files can be found at
/pub/svensson/kuvio:ftp.math.ubc.ca.

   kuvio-p209+245.tar.gz           kuvio.tex plus documentation in both source
                                   and PostScript (letter size) form.

   kuvio-p209+245A4.tar.gz         kuvio.tex plus documentation in both source
                                   and PostScript (A4) form.

   kuvio-p209+245ps.tar.gz         kuvio.tex plus documentation in PostScript
                                   (letter size) form only.

   kuvio-p209+245A4ps.tar.gz       kuvio.tex plus documentation in PostScript
                                   (A4) form only.

   kuvio-p209+245src.tar.gz        kuvio.tex plus documentation in source
                                   form only. Not worth the effort unless
                                   you already know what you're in for.

   kuvio-p209.tar.gz               kuvio.tex sans documentation.

   examples.ps.gz                  Teasers from the documentation - the
   examples-A4.ps.gz               table of contents plus 12 pages of
                                   example diagrams.

As far as I know, everything works so if you run into any trouble don't
hesitate to contact me.

Anders
