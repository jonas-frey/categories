Subject: E-M factorization system question

From: "William H. Rowan" <rowan@crl.com>

I am working on a construction which, given a category with an E-M
factorization system (such as onto-oneone functions in the category of sets
or universal algebras of a given type) provides an embedding

        F:A --> B

where A is the given category, and F embeds A fully into B.  B also has an
E-M factorization system.  However, if a is an object of A, then the e's of
Fa are exactly all filters in the lattice of e's of a in A, and the m's of
Fa are exactly all filters in the lattice of m's of a in A.

The question, of course, is, has this been done by anyone before and if so,
please provide a reference to that work.
