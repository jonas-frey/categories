Subject: categories: Reading advise on bicategory theory

Hi,

I am looking for advise on suitable litterature for a beginner in
bicategory-theory. The litterature I have found so far is:

Kelly, Street  Review of the elements of 2-categories
Borceux        Handbook of categorical algebra 1

I have also ordered the following article:

Benabou        Introduction to bicategories

So far I have only read Borceux's book but it contains mainly
definitions. In particular I have difficulties understanding
the need for (and consequences of) the coherence axioms
associated with the natural isomorphisms expressing the
associativity and identity 'axioms'.

Lars, I would guess that you will get more advice than you can
use. Here is my nickel's worth. The matter of coherence is
wide open. There is a paper of Yanofsky accepted for publication
in JPAA which investigates higher dimensional categories with
no coherence assumptions at all -- this coming after a lot of
work on weakened coherence. Benabou's basic point was that
naturally arising 2-dimensional categories are not quite
2-categories and don't seem to suffer from it. Avoid getting
knotted in coherence questions, especially in 1999.

what does "no coherence assumptions at all" mean in this context?
does it mean that yanofsky is studying what i call "coarse
n-categories", defined recursively as categories enriched over the
cartesian closed category where the objects are the coarse
[n-1]-categories and the morphisms are the enriched natural
isomorphism classes of enriched functors?  coarse n-categories are
interesting but they're obviously not the whole story; for example
it's straightforward to define the "fundamental coarse n-groupoid" of
a space, but it's indeed a rather coarse invariant of the homotopy
type.

Concerning the question by Lindquist:

The tensor product automatically satisfies all functoriality, 
associativity and coherence conditions, if it is introduced by a 
universal property as by Bourbaki. This is shown for monoidal 
categories (bicategories with one object) e.g. in my paper 
``Multicategories revisited'', Contemporary Mathematics 92(1989). The 
same argument works for arbitrary bicategories provided, in defining 
a multicategory, one replaces the free monoid generated by a set by 
the free category generated by a graph.

In view of this would it be fair to say that coherence is not a notion
intrinsic to category theory, but rather arises from the traditional
set theoretic presentation (or at least point of view) of category theory?

Much the same can surely be said of naturality, whose abstract essence
is that of 2-cells but which is standardly presented concretely, where
the interchange axiom becomes a not entirely trivial theorem.

I think it's fair to say that operations automatically satisfy all
the right coherence laws if you define them using universal properties.
This is the idea behind Jim Dolan's and my definition of weak n-categories:
all the ways of composing cells are defined by means of universal properties,
so one doesn't need to explicitly list coherence laws - they're automatic.

Indeed, if you ask what are the "right" coherence laws, perhaps the 
easiest answer is: the coherence laws automatically satisfied by universal 
constructions!   (There are also some answers coming from homotopy theory
but probably deep down they are the same answer.)

We pound these points home with great rhetorical flourishes in the 
following paper:

Categorification, in Higher Category Theory, eds. Ezra Getzler and 
Mikhail Kapranov, American Mathematical Society, Providence, 1998, 
pp. 1-36.

I am not sure whether his "course 2-categories" is my associative 
categories. Here is the abstract of my paper available at

Obstructions to Coherence:  Natural Noncoherent Associativity

Abstract
We study what happens when coherence fails. Categories
with a tensor product and a natural associativity isomorphism
that does not necessarily satisfy the pentagon coherence
requirements (called associative categories) are considered.
Categorical versions  of associahedra where naturality squares 
commute and pentagons do not are constructed (called Catalan 
groupoids, $\An$). These groupoids are used in the construction of the
free associative category. They are also used in the
construction of the theory of associative categories (given as a 2-sketch).
Generators and relations are given for the fundamental group, $\pi(\An)$, 
of the Catalan groupoids -- thought of as a simplicial complex. These 
groups are shown to be more than just free groups. Each associative 
category, $\bf B$, has related fundamental groups $\pi(\bf
B_n)$ and homomorphisms $\pi(P_n):\pi(\An) \longrightarrow \pi(\bf
B_n)$. If the images of the $\pi(P_n)$ are trivial, i.e. there is only
one associativity path between any two objects, then the category is
coherent. Otherwise the images of $\pi(P_n)$ are obstructions to
coherence. Some progress is made in classifying noncoherence of 
associative categories.

Yes, but Bourbaki's universal properties required for the  isomorphism 
A(BC) ---> (AB)C is that a(bc) |---> (ab)c (see Algebre II.64). 
Mac Lane's classical counterexample a(bc)|--->(-1)(ab)c 
surely does not satisfy this coherence condition (page 163 of CWM). 
By the way, the fundamental group that corresponds to this
associative category is Z_2 since going around once does not give 
the identity but going around twice does.

The whole point of my paper is that there are no "right" coherence laws.
Each structure has interesting theorems that can be proven about it.
Finding the "right" coherence axioms is like finding the "right" axioms to
study symmetry. Which one is "right": semi-groups, groups, Abelian groups
Lie groups etc.? If coherence theory is to be thought of as some type of
higher-dimensional algebra, then there are many structures that are of
interest.
