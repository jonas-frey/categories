Can somebody give me references to literature on Burroni's graphical
algebras? The only paper I know of is:

"Algebres graphiques" (A. Burroni), Cahiers de Topologie et Geometrie
Differentielle, XXII, 1981.

Many thanks,

Frank Piessens.

This is certainly the primary reference. Unfortunately there were problems
with Burroni's original proof that {toposes + logical morphisms} is
monadic over GRAPH. These are dealt with in

E.J. Dubuc and G.M. Kelly. "A presentation of topoi as algebraic relative to
categories or graphs", Journal of Algebra (81), 1983, 420-433.

There is also a certain amount of material on the example of toposes in

J. Lambek and P.J. Scott. "Introduction to Higher Order Categorical Logic",
CUP, 1986.

I suppose the main point of graphical algebras is that they give a syntax
for describing any category finitarily monadic over GRAPH as a category of
"algebras". A proof of that was known to Kelly at a quite early stage, but
can be recovered from the general machinery in

G.M. Kelly and A.J. Power. "Adjunctions whose units are coequalizers, and
presentations of finitary enriched monads", Jounal of Pure and Applied
Algebra 89 (1993), 163-179

There is also an account in my survey:
"Variations on Algebra: monadicity and generalisations of algebraic theories",
Sussex University Computer Science Technical Report 6/94, 1994.

all best wishes,
Edmund

The subject of graphical algebras is highly interesting (to my taste !) but
rather controversial : there have been many mathematical misunderstandings and many
quarrels about who did what and when. Here are the main lines of my account of
the subject.

In my opinion the fundamental notion is that of an algebraic functor in the sense
of Coppey : this definition of algebricity is of a very intuitive and elementarynature and is for me THE definition of algebricity. The corresponding frameworkwas
introduced in [Coppey72] and is also described in [Coppey-Lair85]. An algebraicfunctor need not have a left adjoint. In fact U is monadic iff U is algebraic and
has a left adjoint ! However an algebraic functor "with rank" is monadic. Now acategory of graphical algebras in the sense of Burroni is exactly a category C
with an algebraic functor C -> Graph. A controversial question (between Coppey
and Burroni !) is : are graphical algebras of any special importance ?
The only partial answer I can give is about the use of categories in computer
science : I have never seen any computer scientist make use of the fact that a
given type of structured categories (say c.c.c.'s) is algebraic over graphs. What
is really used is the algebraicity over "graphs with formal constructors" (somekind of generalized sketches). The problem is that many sources that use that kind of
algebricity refer to Burroni's graphical algebras which is completely misleading :
for example the book [Lambek-Scott86] and the paper [Coquand-Ehrard87].

Categories with specified (co)limits of a given kind are algebraic over categories :
this is a classical result by Lair ([Lair75] or [Lair79]). In some cases
((co)products, (co)equalizers) they are also algebraic over graphs : see [Burron
i81]
and [Coppey-Lair85]. Cartesian closed categories as well as elementary topoi are
also algebraic over graphs : the history of these results is not simple and
involves at least [Burroni81], [Dubuc-Kelly83], [MacDonald-Stone84] and [Ageron91].
An interesting example is that of Peano-Lawvere categories. It follows from general
reasons that they are algebraic over categories; Burroni raised the question : are they
algebraic over graphs - it was solved negatively in [Coppey-Lair85].

Much more could be said on that subject, e.g. the link between algebricity and
sketchability but this message is already too long. I refer to [Ageron91] for asynthetic introduction and to [Coppey-Lair85] for more.
