Is the pullback of a monadic functor along a monadic functor
necessarily monadic?
Is the diagonal of the pullback square monadic?
Does this work if your restrict yourself to, say, finitary monadic
functors?

(E.g. it works for finitary monads on Set: the theory of sets with
both ring and lattice structure (not interacting in any particular
way) comes from a monad.)

Thanks,
Tom Leinster

No. And I seem to remember this was one of the main points of the thesis
(under Lawvere) of Michel Thie'baud. The thesis title was "Self-dual
structure-semantics & algebraic categories" (Dalhousie University, Halifax,
Nova Scotia, August 1971). Comonads (= cotriples) in Mod (= Bimod = Prof =
Dist) are the subject. Using these to define "algebraic", Michel obtained
stability under pullback.

I just realised my hasty response to Tom Leinster was to the question of
pullback of a monadic alond an *arbitrary* functor; not Tom's question!

Let K be a complete and cocomplete category, and Mnd(K) the category
of monads on K and strict morphisms of monads. If T and S are monads
on K which preserve (alpha-)filtered colimits (for a regular cardinal
alpha), then 
	(i)the coproduct T+S exists in Mnd(K) 
	(ii)this coproduct is ``algebraic'', meaning that the diagonal
	    of the pullback square 
			       K^S
			        |
				|
				v
			  K^T-->K 
	    is the forgetful functor K^(T+S)-->K
	(iii)the projections K^(T+S)-->K^T and K^(T+S)-->K^S are
            monadic.
Much can be done without completeness, but the proofs become a bit harder.

See the paper
	G.M.Kelly, A unified treatment of transfinite constructions for
	free algebras, free monoids, colimits, associated sheaves, and so on,
	Bull. Austral. Math. Soc. 22(1980):1--83
for a survey of many such results.

In fact if K is locally finitely presentable then the category
Mnd_f(K) of finitary monads on K and strict morphisms of monads
is itself locally finitely presentable; for this see my paper
``On the monadicity of finitary monads'', to appear in JPAA, but
in the meantime available at
http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au:8000/res/Catecomb/Lack/1997-29.html.

Hi Tom,

if I'm not mistaken, this reduces for full isomorphism-closed embeddings to the 
(finite) Intersection Problem (of full iso-closed subcategories) answered 
negatively by Trnkova, Adamek, Rosicky ("Topological reflections revisited", 
ProcAMS 108,3 (1990) p605; see also Tholen "Reflective Subcategories" TopAppl 27 
(1987) p201, Adamek, Rosicky "Intersections of reflective subcategories" ProcAMS 
103 (1988) p710).

Full iso-closed subcategories of locally lambda-presentable categories are 
reflective and closed under lambda-directed colimits iff they are 
lambda-orthogonal, so intersections of such subcategories are reflective 
(Adamek, Rosicky "Locally presentable and Accessible Categories" CUP 94).

Bye, Jan

 Triples is back, at least for the time being, after having been down,
 either from its problems or the lack of power at McGill for most of the
 last month.
 
 I have just seen the question about pullback of tripleable functors and
 I have not seen a really satisfactory reply.  A lot--maybe all--of what
 I say below is probably in Ernie Manes' thesis (A Triple Miscellany,
 Wesleyan U., 1967).  The answer is definitely no, but the problem is the
 lack of adjoint.  Consider, for the example, the complete semilattice
 triple on Set.  It is also the covariant powerset triple, with singleton
 for eta and union (or intersection) for mu (one will give you sup
 semilattices, the other the inf semilattices).  That is one triple and
 the other is N x -, whose algebras are sets with a single unary
 operation.  The pullback is the category whose objects are complete
 semilattices with a single unary function that is not assumed to cohere
 in any way with the semilattice structure.  A complete boolean algebra
 is model of such a theory, taking complement as the unary operation.  If
 there were free algebras of this type, then a quotient of them would be
 a free complete boolean algebra, but we know these don't exist.
 
 Of course, one can raise the question under the assumption that the
 adjoint exists.  For example, if the category is locally presentable
 (complete and accessible) and the functors are accessible.  Then if the
 functors are T_1 and T_2, simply apply them alternately, taking colimits
 at limit ordinals, until they stabilize and that will give you free
 algebras.  Of course, it is obvious that the pullback is the category
 whose objects consist of T_1A ---> A <--- T_2A which are algebras for
 each triple, but no assumption of coherence between the two structures
 is made.  It seems pretty obvious, although I have no really checked the
 details carefully, that this will satisfy Beck's condition.  Or rather
 the forgetful functor to each of the individual category of algebras as
 well as the composite.  For example, if we had the situation
            T_1A -----------> A <------------- T_2A

            T_1C - - - - - -> C <- - - - - - - T_2C
 are split coequalizers too, whence the dotted arrows exist.  That the
 whole diagram is a coequalizer in the pullback category is also easy.
 Thus the answer is yes, provided the adjoint exists, but that is not
 guaranteed even over Set.

Mike is right. The problem lies in the existence of a left adjoint. However
if one pulls back over a Grothendieck co-(=op-)fibration, then if U has a
left adjoint, then so does its pullback. In fact, a functor is a
cofibration iff it is universal for this property, i.e., it has this
property and this property is stable under arbitrary pullbacks."A
cofibration is a universal change of base for right adjoints". I don't know
if this is of much help, but it is amusing.
