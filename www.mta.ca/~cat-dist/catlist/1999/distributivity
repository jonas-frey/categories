I pass on to you a curious fact that was mentioned to me by Richard
Squire and he credited it to Jim Loveys.  Let P and Q be quantifiers.
(What is a quantifier?  Well as a first approximation it is a map from
X--o L to L which is in some obscure (to me) sense polymorphic.  Limits
(both in categories and posets), integrals and, evidently, univeral and
existential quantifiers in logic, where L is the object of truth values.
Looking at all the examples, you realize immediately that polymorphism
is certainly not functoriality and if some of them give inequalities or
morphisms, they do so in different directions (say SUP vs INF or A vs
E).)
 
    Well, anyway, P and Q are quantifiers.  Say that P distributes over
Q if there is an equation
    P(x:X).Q(y:Y).f(x,y) = Q(s:X--o Y).P(x:X).f(x,s(x))
    One aspect of polymorphism is that this makes sense.  Here f: X x Y
--> L and if treat this as a map Y --> (X--o L), then the LHS makes
sense.  As for the RHS, we are doing the same thing with X x (X--o Y)
--> X x Y --> L, where the first map is <id,eval> and the second is f.
Here are 2 1/2 examples: If P is universal quantification, Q is
existential and L is the object of truth values in a topos, then this is
the axiom of choice.  If P is sup in a lattice and Q is inf and if X and
Y are restricted to finite sets, then this is the statement of
distributivity.  If P is SUP in a complete lattice and Q is INF, then
this is the complete distributivity identity.  Now here is the startling
fact.  In all three cases, the distributivity of P over Q implies that
of Q over P!  For the lattices, these facts are well-known.  For the AC,
it is easy to see (at least in a boolean topos) since you can negate and
replace f by its complementary relation.  (Yes a topos that satisfies AC
is boolean, but it does not immediately follow that these two
complementary conditions are equivalent, since perhaps only one of them
implies AC in the non-boolean case.)  This doesn't always hold.  For
example, in a topos, finite products distribute over (finite) sums, but
the converse is certainly false.

This is a comment tangential to Michael Barr's message about
quantifiers.  His 2 1/2 examples can be improved to 3, because the
condition he calls complementary to AC also implies classical logic.
Recall that this condition reads:

(exists x:X) (forall y:Y) f(x,y) iff
(forall s: X --> Y) (exists x:X) f(x,s(x)).             (*)

The left-to-right implication here is trivial, but I claim the
right-to-left implication implies  (not not u) ==> u  and thus Boolean
logic.  

The easiest proof proceeds as follows in the internal logic.  Given an
arbitrary truth value  u , let  X={.|u}, i.e., X has at most one
element and it's inhabited iff u, and let Y be empty.  Then
(not not u) implies the right side of (*) [vacuously: the existence of
such an s implies  not u ], while the left side of (*) implies  u .

For people who would like to banish the empty set at the cost of some
simplicity (universal algebraists?), there is an alternate argument
using only inhabited sets.  Again, let a truth value  u  be given, let
Y=2, i.e., a set with exactly two, definitely distinct elements, and
let  X  be the quotient of Y in which the two elements have been
identified iff  u .  Let  f(x,y)  mean that the canonical projection
from Y to X sends y to x.  Again, one can check that  (not not u)
implies the right side of (*) and that the left side of (*) implies u.

It is curious that the same X, Y, and f as in this second proof are
also used for the (internal) proof of Diaconescu's theorem that AC
implies classical logic.

Here is another comment somewhat tangential to Mike's post about 
distributivity. If a lattice is completely distributive, CD, then
the fact that the opposite distributivity holds might be written
AC==>(CD<==>CD^op), for at least some aspect of choice seems to
be necessary. Write CCD, "constructive complete distributivity",
for the apparent weakening of CD that requires distributivity, in
the sense Mike posted, of infs over sups of down-closed subsets.
Then AC<==>(CD<==>CCD). On the other hand, writing BOO for the
axiom which states that the object of truth values is Boolean, one
has BOO<==>(CCD<==>CCD^op). Combining these results gives an 
indirect proof of AC==>BOO.

The fact that BOO is necessary for CCD<==>CCD^op is, at first,
surprising. The equivalence of CCD and CCD^op rests entirely on
whether or not the object of truth values, which is always CCD,
is CCD^op. In set^2, the object of truth values being 3--->2,
one expects a counterexample to the claim. The pitfall here is
that distributivity of binary sup over binary inf does not extend
to distributivity of sups over infs of up-closed subobjects. To
sketch a proof of the necessity of BOO, show that CCD==>HEY.
Unlike the situation for general Heyting algebras, it follows
from a lemma attributed to both Benabou and Reyes that if the
opposite of the object of truth values is Heyting then it is
Boolean.

These observations are simplified by the fact that CCD(L) is
equivalent to the statement that sup:DL--->L has a left adjoint,
where DL is the lattice of down-closed subobjects of L, and DL
is equivalent to ord(L^op, Omega), where Omega is the object of 
truth values.
