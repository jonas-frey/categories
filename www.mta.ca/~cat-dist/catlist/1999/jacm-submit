JACM is the flagship technical journal of the ACM. As recent additions
to the Editorial Board, we would like encourage the submission of first-rate
papers in the areas of programming languages and logic in computer science,
broadly construed.

Although the purpose of this message is to encourage submissions, JACM still
has a moderate backlog. Space constraints only allow for publication of 3-5
papers per year in each of the main areas of computer science. As a result,
only a handful of the most exciting or innovative papers from conferences
like LICS, POPL, ICFP and PLDI could be considered in any given year. Within
these constraints, we would like to see JACM cover as many active research
areas as possible.

Submissions may be in the form of postscript files, sent to the Editor-in-Chief(see http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~jacm/) or area editors by electronic mail.
Paper submission is also possible.
