Subject: Gentzen and Hilbert formulations of Linear logic

From: Moneesha Mehta <moneesha@mscs.dal.ca>


I am looking for ( wihtin the next week or two) a Gentzen formulation of
linear logic with no empty sequence at the left.  Girard formulates his
with an empty sequence at the left (1995) and Retore (1997) only does the
multiplicative part.  I would also like a Hilbert-style formulation if one
has ever been written.  Does anyone have any reference(s) or ideas?

Thanks,

M. Mehta
