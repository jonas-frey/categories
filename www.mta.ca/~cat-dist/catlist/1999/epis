Subject: [Q] Modified notion of epi

In any category the pullback of a monic is monic, but this does not
hold for epis. However in the category Sets (or in an abelian category)
the pullback of a surjective function is surjective.
Is there another notion of "epi" for categories that is preserved
by pullbacks, and that is surjectivity in the category Sets?

Effective descent morphisms. (See Carboni, Janelidze, Kelly and Pare, "On
localization and stabilization for factorization systems".) p: A -> B in C
(with finite limits) is effective descent iff the pullback functor between
slice categories, p*: C/B -> C/A, is monadic. In any topos, effective
descent = epi.

The short answer is that only split epis (those with a right inverse)
are preserved under pullbacks in "all" categories.  In any topos, for
example, all epis are stable (the word used when they are preserved
by pulling back), but then all epis are regular.  Both of these
facts are also valid in any abelian category.  There is a large
class of categories, the so-called regular categories in which
regular epis (those that are coequalizers of some pair of arrows)
are stable.  Small regular categories have a faithful functor into
sets^I for some (discrete) index set I that preserves regular epis
and finite limits and only regular epis go to epis.  (There is also
a full, faithful functor into a category of set-valued functors, but
that has turned out to be less useful.)  One reason that regular
categories have turned out to be interesting is that *every*
equationally defined category is regular.  But, for example, the
category of posets and the category of small categories are not
regular, whence neither can be defined equationally.

Well, yeah. But there is another short answer. I didn't know how to
answer the original note without sounding stupid. I still don't. But
there have been those who have given names to just those epis that are
preserved under pullback, the most popular being "stable epis." So:

  The short answer is that only stable epis (those preserved by
  pullbacks) are preserved under pullbacks.

Sorry about this. Anyway: split implies stable.

Of course, split epis (= retractions) will answer this if Set has choice.

I believe Hubertus Bargenda has such a notion.

I don't know his current email address but he is at
University of the Orange Free State in South Africa..
All best, Keith Hardie.
