I am just about to finish the writing up of my thesis and have
one remaining difficulty. I needed to use the following result
about a symmetric monoidal closed categorie C,
`If C has coequalizers then so does the category CMon(C) of
commutative monoids over C'
I feel sure that this result is well known by anybody who
has worked with symmetric monoidal closed categories and so
have been frustrated by the fact that can't  find a
reference for it. Does anybody know where I can find
such a reference for this result (or of some generalization
of it)?

Thanks

Chris Townsend

In my "Topos Theory" book, you will *very nearly* find a proof
that, if C is symmetric monoidal closed, then the forgetful
functor CMon(C) --> C creates coequalizers of reflexive pairs.
(See Lemma 0.17 and Exercise 0.1; in the latter, the cartesian
products have to be replaced by tensor products, but that is
a triviality.) Given that all finite colimits can be constructed
from coproducts and reflexive coequalizers (and that CMon(C)
always has finite coproducts, for a different reason), that is
all you need.

Has anybody seen the following symmetric closed monoidal category?  Let
#A# be a category tripleable over Set.  Let #V# be the comma category
(F,#V#), F being the free functor.  So an object (S,s,A) is an arrow s:FS
--> A and a map (S,s,A) to (T,t,B) is a pair f: S --> T and g: A --> B
making the obvious square commute.  The closed structure (S,s,A) --o
(T,t,B) is a certain arrow of the form (Hom((S,s,A),(T,t,B),?,B^S).  The
monoidal structure is fairly ugly, but it exists. 

Of course, an object (S,s,A) can also be thought of as an S-tuple of
elements of A, by adjointness.

Subject: categories: Barr's symmetric monoidal closed comma category

Mike Barr asked whether anyone had been aware that the comma category
	(F,A)  or equivalently  (S,U)
is symmetric monoidal closed, where
	    A
          ^    |
         F| -| |U
          |    V
            S
is a monoidal (tripleable) adjunction over S=Set.

As he said,  an object (S,s,A) is an arrow s:FS--> A 
(or, by adjointness, an S-tuple of elements of A) and
a map (S,s,A) to (T,t,B) is a pair f: S --> T and g: A --> B
making the obvious square commute.

He said that the closed structure (S,s,A) --o (T,t,B)
is a certain arrow of the form (Hom((S,s,A),(T,t,B),?,B^S).

I have certainly seen comma categories like (S,U); they are referred to
as gluing, sconing or the Freyd cover.  (BTW Peter says that "scone" is
a corruption of Sierpinski cone, so its correct pronunciation is presumably
"shco:ne".)  This construction provides an almost magical proof of
strong normalisation, consistency and similar results for various
fragments of symbolic or categorical logic. The algebraic theory that
I have in mind here for Mike's monadic adjunction is that which describes
the fragment of logic in question (the Australians would prefer us to 
talk about a 2-monad here).

An early example of such a proof in the unification of these two
traditions was given by Yves Lafont in an appendix to his thesis.
He proved that the embedding of a category in the free CCC that it generates
is full and faithful.  In the course of this he described the exponential
in (S,U), which is what Mike's formula gives, though I didn't notice
(and apparently nor did Yves) that the A-object which we have is the
internal version of Mike's Hom-set.

Yves Lafont's result appears as part of a generic account of the gluing
construction in Section 7.7 of my forthcoming book.

From: HASEGAWA Masahito <hassei@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

Related to Mike and Paul's messages to categories, I had the
following observation in my recent draft paper 
(http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~hassei/papers/basic.ps.gz
 "Logical predicates for intuitionistic linear logic", Lemma A.1): 

	Suppose that C and D are symmetric monoidal closed
	categories and that G:C->D is a symmetric monoidal
	functor. Moreover suppose that D has pullbacks.
	Then the comma category (D,G) can be given a symmetric
	monoidal closed structure, so that the obvious projection
	(D,G)->C is strict symmetric monoidal closed.  

I used this (together with the free symmetric monoidal cocompletion) 
for deriving "logical predicates (logical relations)" for
intuitionistic linear type theories, thus in a similar way as Lafont's 
use of glueing for typed lambda calculi and ccc. In this paper I also
have another lemma for glueing symmetric monoidal adjunctions, for
interpreting the modality !.

I have been wondering if this is a sort of folklore, but never found a 
reference. 

Best Regards,

Masahito.

Subject: categories: Symmetric monoidal closed comma categories

This concerns the discussion by Mike Barr, Paul Taylor, and Masahito
Hasegawa regarding symmetric monoidal closed comma categories:
	The construction (later called 'comma') in the category of
categories was introduced in 1963 primarily for foundational
simplification (though it was clear that certain particular cases, such as
slice, were already in direct use).  Besides the 2-categorical equational
description of adjointness, one needs the description in terms of a
bijection between arrows, but that does not require the complicated
assumption that there exists a category of sets in which two given
categories can be enriched.  Namely, an adjunction between two given
categories can be described by giving a third 'adjunction category',
related by appropriate functors to them, which is isomorphic to two
differently-constructed 'comma' categories.  It seems that there are many
cases in which this third category is of interest in itself, whether or
not one of the two given categories is or is not monadic or comonadic over
the other.
	Emilio Faro's notes from my Fall 1990 Buffalo course Categories of
Space and of Quantity, mention essentially the result cited by Masahito
Hasegawa.  If an adjunction involves monoidal functors, then the
adjunction category tends to be a monoidal closed category.  This remark
was essentially intended to supply semantically-based examples of closed
categories which have one aspect which is linear (in the straightforward
sense that coproducts equal products) and an opposite aspect which is
cartesian (in the sense that the tensor is the categorical product).  Of
course, the most immediate subclass of examples, based on the data of a
rig in a cartesian closed category, involve monadic adjunctions.  On the
other hand, several published papers on related matters axiomatically
assume comonadic adjunctions.
	However, the simple algebraic stance, as Masahito Hasegawa points
out, is that both aspects, as well as the relation between them, are all
regarded as equally given.  As part of the logic (= natural structure) of
the resulting situation there will be unary (= modal?) operators reflected
on each aspect  by composing.  A further step is to investigate to what
extent the data can be approximated via data which is reconstructed on the
basis of only one aspect or the other using this additional reflected
structure.  Both that step a la M. Stone, as well as the simple algebraic
stance in the spirit of Chu and G. Mackey, are of course involved in the
full study of any related pair of aspects (e.g. algebra and geometry).
	A problem from topology, where related considerations may help,
concerns the operation of collapsing a connected subspace to a point (the
effect of this operation on relative homology is part of the content of
algebraic topology).  In extending this operation to apply to
not-necessarily-connected subspaces (and more generally, from inclusion
maps to arbitrary maps), collapsing all these to a point would be an
unnecessarily discontinuous functor.  Rather, within the category whose
objects are continuous maps, consider the subcategory wherein the domains
of these structural maps are discrete (or zero-dimensional, if that is
different in the model of continuity being considered).  That subcategory
is reflective (with the help of pushout) in case the model admits a left
adjoint connected-components functor.  In the case of a subspace, the
reflector collapses each of its components to a distinct point in the new
ambient space, and the lifted unit of the adjunction is epimorphic if the
original one (to the connected components pi zero) is, even where the
subspace is empty.  I am wondering:  under what conditions are these
categories and functors cartesian monoidal closed? 
	Indeed these things are probably folklore, but listed
below are some references containing partial indications.

Subject: categories: Re: Chew on this

One more comment on that fascinating ugly monoidal structure. Many
years ago D. Pataraia as a student was asked to realise tensor product of
vector spaces (V and W over k) as a colimit. He then came up with a
diagram (sorry for still more ugly notation)

                                 k_{v,w}
                                 /    \
                                /      \
                              |_        _|
                            V_w          W_v

That is, vertices of the diagram consist of U(W) copies of V, U(V) copies
of W, and U(V)xU(W) copies of k (U is the forgetful functor to sets). And
the maps... well, you guess.

The reason this is relevant is that in the Barr's monoidal category, the
product of (S->U(A)) and (T->U(B)) is (SxT->U(C)) where C is the colimit,
in the category of algebras, of

                                 F(1)_{s,t}
                                 /    \
                                /      \
                              |_        _|
                            A_t          B_s

It does not look so ugly after all, does it?
