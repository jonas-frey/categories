Subject: categories: lax monad

I am looking for literature references for the notion of a 'lax' monad (or
triple), and lax algebras over such, in the context of 2-categories--the
definition being that the usual diagrams commute only up to a 2-cell.  Can
anyone suggest good references?  

Thanks,
Gaunce Lewis

Some good old references are:

M. Barr "Relational algebras" SLNM 137 (1970) 39-55
M. Bunge, "Coherent extensions and relational algebras" Transactions AMS
around 1974.
G.M. Kelly & R. Street, "Review of the elements of 2-categories" SLNM 420
(1974) 75-103.
