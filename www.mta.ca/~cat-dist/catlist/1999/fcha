Does anyone know whether the free complete Heyting algebra on two
generators exists? That is, does it have a set rather than a proper class
of elements? It's obvious that the free cHa on aleph_0 generators is a
proper class, since it has the free complete Boolean algebra on the same
generators as a quotient. However, when you look at the finitary theory of
Heyting algebras, the free algebra on two generators already exhibits all
the bad behaviour you get in larger free algebras. (By the way, the free
cHa on one generator does exist: it has just one more element than the
free Ha on one generator.)

Concerning Peter Johnstone's question about the free complete Heyting
algebras on finitely many generators:


1) If the free one on one generator is presented as a finitary algebra
on  two generators, presumably it is infinitely related ?
2) Is the result re one generator valid in any topos ? If so, the method
so effective in complex analysis might conceivably work : the n+1
generator algebra is a one generator algebra in a topos over n dimensional
space ?
3) I often speculated that a useful way of picturing these things might
be to consider the parallel coHeyting algebras and use Euler-Venn diagrams
with a more subtle interpretation that takes boundaries seriously.
4) There is apparently a connection between this idea of achieving
completeness with few elements and Andy Pitts result concerning adjoints
between finitary algebras. Can this connection be spelled out more
precisely ?

(1) Certainly not as stated: if H is the free Ha on one generator (a, say),
then one new element is not enough to complete it.

(2) Its completion to a frame (over H qua distributive lattice (DL)) is the
ideal completion Idl(H). (Classically, there is only one non-principal
ideal.) One might ask whether this is the free cHa generated by a (as it is
classically), but this seems unlikely to me - though I don't quite have a
definitive counterexample.

Let B be a cHa with a given element b. Then there is a unique Ha
homomorphism f: H -> B taking a to b, and since f is a DL homomorphism,
there is a unique frame homomorphism g: Idl(H) -> B taking a (or, rather,
the principal ideal generated by a) to b. If there is a cHa homomorphism
taking a to b, it must be g; but it remains to prove that g is a Heyting
algebra homomorphism.

In Idl(H), let I be {0} u {a: p} for some proposition p. Then I -> 0 is

   {x in H: p => x/\a = 0}

For g to preserve ->, we must have

  \/{b: p} -> 0 = \/{f(x): p => x/\a = 0}

Hence if p => c/\b = 0 we must have c < \/{f(x): p => x/\a = 0}. Let us
construct B and c as follows: let L be the DL generated by H (qua DL) and
c, subject to the p-indexed set of relations c/\a = 0 (if p), and let B be
Idl(L). (Note that the injection of generators H -> L -> B is different
from f.) Then this concrete construction reduces the condition c < \/{f(x):
p => x/\a = 0} to showing that there exists x in H such that p => x/\a = 0
and c < f(x). Classically, we take x to be /\{~a: p}, but constructively
this meet is not finite and so doesn't necessarily exist in H.

(3) Assuming the reasoning in (2) goes through, it still leaves open the
question of whether the free cHa on one generator exists (constructed in
some other way).

(4) Incidentally, the original question is ambiguous, surely? To define the
notion of free cHa you must define the notion of homomorphism between
cHa's. Assuming that all joins must be preserved, must all meets also be
preserved, or - a la frames - only finitary ones? The question doesn't
arise with complete Boolean algebras, where negation is an order
antiisomorphism.

Replies to two of Bill's questions:

1) If the free one on one generator is presented as a finitary algebra
on  two generators, presumably it is infinitely related ?

Yes. The free cHa on one generator is not finitely presentable as a
finitary Ha.

2) Is the result re one generator valid in any topos ?

I don't think so: the proof that I know relies on the decidedly
non-constructive fact that every subset of the free Ha on one generator
(L, say) is either finite or cofinal in L - {\top}. So I don't see
much hope of getting an inductive proof along the lines suggested
by Bill.

With regard to PeterJ's answer to BillL's question 1: a quick way to
see that the free cHa on one generator is not finitely presentable is
to use the fact that any finitely presented Ha is residually finite.
Residual finiteness is, in turn, equivalent to everything being the
sup of the finite elements below it (where finite element means one
with only a finite number of elements below it).

Peter J and Steve V offered comments which suggest the following
sharpening of my vague proposal for approaching Peter's interesting
problem :
 1. Which toposes with free finitary algebras have also the free
cocomplete HA on one generator ?
 2.Do these include toposes based on free HAs as sites ?
