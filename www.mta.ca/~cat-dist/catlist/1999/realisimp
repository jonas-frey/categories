Dear colleagues

Consider a simplicial group K. Its realization |K| is a topological
group (at least when K is countable).
The realization of the W-construction yields a universal
|K|-bundle over |overline W K|.
THere should be a canonical map from the latter to the bar
construction B|K| on |K|.

Has this been worked out somewhere in the literature?

Many thanks in advance.

Sincerely yours Johannes
