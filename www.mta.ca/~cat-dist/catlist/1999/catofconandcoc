One defines the category of Diagrams on category A, Diag(A), as
in Makkai & Pare's "Accessible Categories".  One similarly defines
the category of cones on diagrams on A and the category of
cocones on diagrams on A.  Limits and colimits exist when
certain adjunctions hold between these derived categories.

I am sure I have seen one or more papers or monographs giving
the details for the above.  I simply cannot recall where this (these)
workout(s) appeared.  I would like to (re)read the paper(s), so
I would greatly appreciate receiving reminders about where
to look for these results.

Thank you in advance.

With the warmest of season's greetings,
David

In answer to David Benson's question of 22 Dec, a BETTER way of looking
at the whole matter, which works even for weighted limits, is explained
in
        Albert, H.M. and Kelly, G.M., The closure of a class of colimits,
        JPAA 51 (1988) 1--17
