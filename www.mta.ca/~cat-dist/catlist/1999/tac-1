Oriented Singular Homology
Michael Barr


We formulate three slightly different notions of oriented singular
chain complexes and show that all three are naturally homotopic to
ordinary singular chain complexes.

Functorial and algebraic properties of Browns P functor
Luis-Javier Hernandez-Paricio


In 1975 E. M. Brown constructed a functor $\cal P$ which carries
the tower of fundamental groups of the end of a (nice) space to
the Brown-Grossman fundamental group. In this work, we study this
functor and its extensions and analogues defined for pro-sets,
pro-pointed sets, pro-groups and pro-abelian groups. The new
versions of the $\cal P$ functor are provided with more algebraic
structure. Examples given in the paper prove that in general the
$\cal P$ functors  are not faithful, however, one of our main
results establishes that the restrictions of the corresponding
$\cal P$ functors to the full subcategories of towers are faithful.
We also prove that the restrictions of the $\cal P$ functors to
the corresponding full subcategories of finitely generated towers
are also full. Consequently, in these cases, the towers of objects
in the categories of sets, pointed sets, groups and abelian groups,
can be replaced by adequate algebraic models ($M$-sets, $M$-pointed
sets, near-modules and modules.) The article also contains the
construction of left adjoints for the $\cal P$ functors.

On finite induced crossed modules and the homotopy 2-type of mapping cones,
Ronald Brown and Christopher D. Wensley

Results on the finiteness of induced crossed
modules are proved both algebraically and topologically.
Using the Van Kampen type theorem for the fundamental crossed module,
applications are given to the 2-types of mapping cones of
classifying spaces of groups. Calculations of the cohomology
classes of some finite crossed  modules are given,
using crossed complex methods.

Kan extensions along promonoidal functors
Brian Day and Ross Street

Strong promonoidal functors are defined. Left Kan extension (also
called "existential quantification") along a strong promonoidal
functor is shown to be a strong monoidal functor. A construction for the
free monoidal category on a promonoidal category is provided. A
Fourier-like transform of presheaves is defined and shown to take
convolution product to cartesian product.

Symmetric monoidal categories model all connective spectra
R. W. Thomason

The classical infinite loopspace machines in fact
induce an equivalence of categories between a localization
of the category of symmetric monoidal categories and the
stable homotopy category of -1-connective spectra.

Distributive Adjoint Strings
R. Rosebrugh and R. J. Wood

For an adjoint string V -| W -| X -| Y : B --> C, with Y fully faithful,
it is frequently, but not always, the case that the composite
VY underlies an idempotent monad. When it does, we call the string
distributive. We also study shorter and longer `distributive' adjoint
strings and how to generate them. These provide a new construction of
the simplicial 2-category, Delta.

A forbidden-suborder characterization of binarily-composable
diagrams in double categories, Robert Dawson

Tilings of rectangles with rectangles, and tileorders (the associated
double order structures) are useful as ``templates'' for composition in
double categories. In this context, it is particularly relevant to ask
which tilings may be joined together, two rectangles at a time, to form
one large rectangle. We characterize such tilings via forbidden suborders,
in a manner analogous to Kuratowski's characterization of planar graphs.

Categorical Data-Specifications

F. Piessens and E. Steegmans

We introduce MD-sketches, which are a particular kind of Finite Sum sketches.
Two interesting results about MD-sketches are proved. First, we show that,
given two MD-sketches, it is algorithmically decidable whether their
model categories are equivalent. Next we show that data-specifications,
as used in database-design and software engineering, can be translated
to MD-sketches. As a corollary, we obtain that equivalence of
data-specifications is decidable.

On the Size of Categories
Peter Freyd and Ross Street

The purpose is to give a simple proof that a category is equivalent
to a small category if and only if both it and its presheaf category
are locally small.
