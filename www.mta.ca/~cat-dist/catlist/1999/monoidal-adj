Consider the following definition from Eilenberg and Kelly 1966:

(C; x, l, r, a, I) and (C'; x', l', r', a', I') are monoidal
categories. A functor F from C' to C is called monoidal if there is a
natural transformation n: FA x FB --> F(Ax'B) and a morphism p: FI' --> I
commuting in a suitable sense with l, l', r, r', a and a'.

What we have proved is the following:

LEMMA

Let (F,G) be an adjunction between (symmetric) monoidal categories C
and C'. If F (the left adjoint) is a (symmetric) monoidal functor such
that n consists of isomorphisms and p is an isomorphism then G is also
monoidal and unit and counit are monoidal natural transformations.


The proof is pretty straightforward. Yet, we could not find such a
lemma anywhere in the literature. Can anyone help with pointers to
existing work?

Answer to the question of Achim Jung, Mathias Kegelmann & Eike Ritter:

See a paper of Max Kelly in Springer Lecture Notes in Math 420
called "Doctrinal adjunction" pages 257-280. The Proposition
has other clauses: e.g., an adjunction in the 2-category of (symm)
monoidal categories and monoidal functors is exactly of the kind you
describe.

Dear Jung et al.,

the result you mention, in a more general form, is in my paper
"Doctrinal adjunction" in Springer Lecture Notes in Math. 420 (1974).
Regards, Max Kelly.

As well as the paper cited by Ross Street, this is mentioned, though
not actually stated as a lemma, on page 15 of the technical report
version of my paper

 A Mixed Linear and Non-Linear Logic: Proofs, Terms and Models
 Technical report 352 University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory
October 1994

I noticed it in connection with a proof-theoretically unpleasant
`adjoint' presentation of LNL logic (Section 3.1.2) in which the
rules for the two functors are just

 F\Theta |- A  (in L)
 ------------
 \Theta |- GA  (in C)

and

 \Theta |- GA  (in C)
 ------------
 F\Theta |- A  (in L)

Since G doesn't appear on the left in either of these rules, it's
not *immediately* clear why G has to behave well with respect to the
monoidal structures interpreting the commas in the antecedents. The
answer is in the lemma above.
