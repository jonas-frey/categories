A year or two ago someone wrote a comparative review of several books in
the area of category theory in computer science.  I would appreciate
finding out where it is available.  Thanks,

Probably Charles is thinking  of David Benson's review of five
books in  COMPUTING REVIEWS  Nov 1993, 577-579 under the title
"Comparative Review" # 9311-0833.
