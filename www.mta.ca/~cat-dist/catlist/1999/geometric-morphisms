Subject: characterization of geometric morphisms of the form Pi_I ??

I would like to know whether somebody knows of an abstract
characterization of those geometric morphisms (between elementary
toposes) which are of the form  Pi_I : E/I -> E  for some I in E ?
My - maybe misleading - intuition is that a topos is a generalized
locale and the functor  I* : E -> E/I  corresponds to the locale
morphisms corresponding to open subspace inclusions.

(If  L  is a locale and  x  is in L  then the mapping   y |-> x inf y
from  L  to   { z : L |  z  less or equal  x }   is the locale
morphism corresponding to the open subspace inclusion of the open
subset given by  x  into the space given by  L).
Maybe it is also wrong to think of a topos simply as generalized
locale and that the "generalized locale" is given by the fibration
Sub(E) -> E  and not by the fibration  cod : Map(E) -> E . What I
know about open geometric morphisms seems to confirm this latter
viewpoint.
So I am a bit confused and would appreciate any hints !

Does anyone know whether in the category  Geom  of toposes and
geometric morphism the local homemorphisms form the mono part of a
factorization system ?
Or is that at least the case in the luff subcategory where one has
only essential geomtric morphism whose leftmost adjoint preserves
pullbacks. Has this latter category ever been srudied ?
