Is this new?

  Let  *A*  be a locally small category. Let  *D*  be the category
  whose objects are set-valued bifunctors on  *A*  (contravariant on
  the first variable, covariant on the second) and whose maps are the
  dinatural transformations. Then  *A*  is a groupoid.

Well, OK, what I mean is that dinaturals are closed under composition iff
*A*  is a groupoid. (And, yes, this could all be done with the category of
sets replaced with a topos.)

I trust the following is old, but who has a reference?

  If  *A*  is a groupoid then  *D*  is equivalent to the category of
  presheaves on  *A*.

        [Let  *D*  be the category
        whose objects are] set-valued bifunctors on  *A*  (contravariant on
        the first variable, covariant on the second)

Two definitional/notational suggestions:

        1.   "sesquifunctors on A" for the objects of *D*

        2.   A -X A as a notation for *D*

The right-hand half of the X in -X is intended to suggest the
contravariant bit.  One then has the following hierarchy.

  A => B   "functions" from A to B, viz. !A -o B
  A -o B   (homo)morphisms from A to B
  A -X B   sesquifunctors A\op x A -> B, dinaturally transformed

The first two come from linear logic, with !A = FU being interpreted as
the underlying object (e.g. underlying set) of A reflected back into
the category via F.  F serves merely to make the underlying objects the
same "kind" as the objects they underlie, avoiding a proliferation of
kinds in order to keep linear logic typeless, or at least kindless.

I had asked if the following is new:

  Let  *A*  be a locally small category. Let  *D*  be the category
  whose objects are set-valued bifunctors on  *A*  (contravariant on
  the first variable, covariant on the second) and whose maps are the
  dinatural transformations. Then  *A*  is a groupoid.

Meaning, of course, that dinaturals are closed under composition iff
*A*  is a groupoid.

Well, all I've received are requests for the proof. So: given  *A*
let  P  denote the covariant power-set functor on the category of
sets. Fix an object  C.  Consider the bifunctor that sends  A  to
P(C,A)  and consider the dinatural transformation  (A,A) -> P(C,A)
that sends an endomorphism  e  in  (A,A)  to the set of solutions o
the equation:
                x          x    e
              C -> A  =  C -> A -> A.

The composition  1 -> (A,A) -> P(C,A)  has as its unique value the
_entire_ subset of maps from  C  to  A. If it is dinatural then for
any  f:A -> C:
                  P(C,A)
                /
              1      | P(1,f)
                \
                  P(C,C).
                                                 g    f
Every endomorphism of  C  is thus of the form  C -> A -> C. In
particular, the identity map is of that form, that is, f  is left
invertible, hence, every map targeted at  C  is left-invertible. If
this remains true for every  C  then every map in  *A*  is left
invertible, thus invertible.

I also asked for a reference for:

 If  *A*  is a groupoid then  *D*  is equivalent to the category of
  presheaves on  *A*.

Nobody's asked for it, but let  *A*  be a groupoid anyway. For any
target category and any dinatural  S -> T  one may easily prove that
the hexagon used for defining dinaturals expands to a commutative
diagram (from which the computability of dinaturals easily follows):

                  SAA  ------------------> TAA

            SfA /     \ SAf           TfA /    \ TAf

          SBA             SAB  -->  TBA            TAB

            SBf \     / SfB           TBf \    / TfB

                  SBB  -------------------> TBB.

  If  *A*  is a groupoid then the category composed of dinaturals
  between bifunctors from  *A*  to  *B*  is equivalent to the category
  composed of natural transformations between covariant functors from
  *A*  to  *B*.

Show that for any bifunctor, S, there is an isomorphism (in the
category composed of dinaturals) to a bifunctor, T, with the special
property that  TAB = TAA  and  TAx = TA1. Given  S  define  T  to be
the bifunctor such that  TAB = SAA  and  Tfg = Sff' (where  f'  is the
inverse of  f). The collection of identity functions from  SAA  to
TAA  forms a dinatural transformation as does the collection of
identity functions from  TAA  back to  SAA.

The full subcategory of such functors is easily seen to be isomorphic
to the category of contravariant functors from  *A*  to  *B*.

Whoops. I lifted the proof I posted yesterday out of a longer ms I'm
writing. It occured to me (you know how it goes -- around 3 a.m.) that
it assumed the reader already knew the dinatural transformation
1 -> (A,A). Its source is the terminal set-valued bifunctor: the
constant bifunctor whose constant value is a one-element set. Its
target is the "hom" bifunctor. The dinatural transformation is the one
with identity maps as values.

See: the reader did already know it (because, of course, it's the
only dinatural from  1  to  (A,A)  that can be defined uniformly for
all categories).
