Hi everyone in 'categories' !

I found only a few pages related in Johnstone's Topos theory'.
I am interested in serious introduction to 'internal categories'.
I am especially looking for:
 1: full systematic internalization of all fundamental concepts of category
    theory, including natural transformations, limits and adjoints
 2: books, papers etc. developing classic theories on such abstract (internal)
    level
Does anyone enjoy playing with 'internal' too ?

Ross Street, Cosmoi of internal categories, Transactions American

could be of interest.

        There is a lot in Johnstone's few pages. I also cover this, making
it look as much like naive category theory as I could, in chapter 20
of my book _Elementary categories, elementary toposes_ (Oxford 1992).
This book is due out in paperback soon.

        And you should look at Benabou "Fibred categories and the
foundations of naive category theory" (Jour. Symbolic Logic 50,
1985, 10-37) and Johnstone and Pare _Indexed categories_, Springer
Lecture Notes in Math 661.
