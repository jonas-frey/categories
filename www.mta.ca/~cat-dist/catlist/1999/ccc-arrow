Does anyone what conditions are necessary in a category
C for its arrow category to be Cartesian Closed.  I have
come up with a solution, but it is rather mechanical.

Thanks,

Question from Kathy Van Stone:

Let's agree that a category  A  is cartesian closed when it has finite
products and each functor  a x - : A --> A  has a right adjoint  [a,-].

By examining the various adjunctions between  A  and the arrow category
A'  of  A, or otherwise, we see that:

        A' is cartesian closed if and only if  A  is cartesian closed
        and, for all arrows  f : a --> b,  g : c --> d  in  A,  the
        arrows  [f,1] : [b,d] --> [a,d],  [1,g] : [a,c] --> [a,d]
        admit a pullback  P(f,g)  in  A.

The internal hom of  f, g  as objects of  A'  is then  P(f,g) --> [b,d].
Perhaps this is the mechanical answer you had already.

Best regards,
Ross

Assuming that by "arrow category" you mean the functor category
[2,C], this is a special case of the question of when a category
obtained by Artin glueing is cartesian closed. This (and related
questions) was dealt with in my joint paper with Aurelio Carboni
(Math. Struct. Comp. Sci. 5 (1995), 441--459).
