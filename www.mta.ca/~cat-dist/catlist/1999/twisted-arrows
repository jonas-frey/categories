In Chapter IX, Sec 6, Ex 3 of CWM, MacLane defines the twisted arrow
category of C such that objects are arrows f : a -> b of C and arrows
are pairs of morphisms of C, (l,m) : f -> g, such that g = mfl. The
construction is part of a proof of the reduction of ends to limits.

I would be grateful for pointers to other occurrences of this construction
in the literature.

The twisted arrow category of  A  is the category of elements of the hom
functor  A(-,-) : A^op x A --> Set.  In internal and variable category
theory there is a sense in which the twisted arrow fibration comes first
and then can be used to define hom functors and local smallness.  For
example, see page 292 of my paper

Cosmoi of internal categories, Transactions American Math. Soc. 258 (1980)

The twisted arrow category is discussed in my paper "Extension Theories for
Categories", available at

http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/papers.html

(it has never been published).

Subject: categories: twisted systems

Following on from my earlier posting Re: twisted arrow categories, the
following paper is now available on my home page:
http://theory.doc.ic.ac.uk/~le/ .

Twisted Systems and the Logic of Imperative Programs

Following Burstall, a flow diagram can be represented by a pair
consisting of a graph and a functor from the free category to the
category of sets and relations. A program is verified by incorporating
the assertions of the Floyd-Naur proof method into a second functor and
exhibiting a natural transformation to the program.

A broader range of properties is obtained by substituting spans for
relations and introducing oplaxness into both the functors representing
programs and the natural transformations in the morphisms between
programs. The apparent complexity of this generalization is overcome by
the observation that an oplax functor J -> Sp(C)  is essentially the
same as a functor Tw(J) -> C where Tw(J)  is the twisted arrow category
of J. Thus, a program is a presheaf Tw(F(G) -> Set as are the properties
of the program.

By analogy with categorical models of first-order logic, a program and
the properties which pertain to it are subobjects of a suitably chosen
base object. In this setting safety and liveness properties are dual in
a fibre of subobjects.

I welcome any comments and suggestions.
