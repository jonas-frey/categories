From: Ronnie Brown <r.brown@bangor.ac.uk>

I have put on the web

http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/hdaweb2.htm

an article with the above title. This is intended to give general readers
an idea of what this subject is about, so it is non technical, and that is
why it has a link from the sculpture site. We want to inform scientists
and young mathematicians of what is going on, and to get
discussion of these ideas.

The references could be enlarged and improved, and I would welcome
suggestions on this.

I would welcome comments on this article before submitting it for
publication.
