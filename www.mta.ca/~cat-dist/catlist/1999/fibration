Hi,
I need to use the following result about the equivalence between the
existence of a fibration and the existence of a right adjoint to
an opportune functor between comma categories:
-----------------
Let A and B be categories and let U:A-->B be a
functor.
Let C denote the comma category A arrow (whose objects are the arrows
of A)
and
let D denote the comma category B over U (whose objects are arrows in B
from a generic object b into U(a), together with a).
Then U induces a functor V:C-->D, that basically is U (as both objects
and arrows in C are arrows in A too)
and is defined as follows:
* V(f:a-->a')=(U(f):U(a)-->U(a'),a') for each object
  f:a-->a' in A;
* V(g,g')=(U(g),g') for each arrow
  (g,g'):(f1:a1-->a'1)----->(f2:a2-->a'2) in A.

Then U is a fibration iff V has a right adjoint G:D-->C s.t.
G;V is the identity on D and the counit of the adjunction is
the identity natural transformation.
-----------------
Now, I know (or at least I believe) that the result holds, as
I have a proof for it; but a collegue said to me that this is
a known result and suggested to look at the works by Street
in the Sydney Category Seminar.
Unfortunately, being quite ignorant about 2categories, I find very
hard even to understand in which sense the result I want is there.

Does anybody know an easier reference, possibly not involving
2categories?

Thanks
Maura

dear Maura Cerioli

yes, the Street paper is hard to read.  but he refers to a paper of
Gray's which has the result you mention.  in fact Gray credits it to a
manuscript of Chevalley's which was lost in the mail.

while i didn't read your description of the result, the way i think of
it is as follows.  you have a functor

        p: E --> B

this induces a functor (with comma category B/p relative to id: B -->
B <-- E :p and with 2 the ordinal)

        p.: E^2 --> B/p

which takes

        `paths in E' to
        `paths in B with the to end in E remembered'

then (modulo the axiom of choice) p is a fibration iff p. has a right
adjoint c. with identity couint.  c. is then a cleavage.  this unfolds
(viewing c. as terminal objects in comma categories) to the usual
elementary definition in terms of cartesian maps.  Gray says p. is
rari, i.e. has a right adjoint right inverse.  one can show that this
isn't weaker.  as i recall, Street's definition is weaker in order to
be more invariant.  (cod: B^2 --> B is an important example.  then
c. is pull-back.)

actually i need fibrations in 2-categories of monoidal categories.
note that, in cat the 2-category of categories, E^2 is the comma
category E/E (relative to id: E --> E <-- E :id).  further, still in
cat, E^2 is the cotensor 2 -o E.  but in any 2-category, finite
weighted limits, including comma objects, can be built up from
cotensors with 2 and (2-) terminal objects and pull-backs.

to help you read Street, i now define cotensor with 2.  2-categories
have hom categories rather than hom sets.  2 -o E is defined by
isomorphisms

        hom(W, 2 -o E) iso 2 -o hom(W, E)

(2-) natural in W.  (sometimes such isomorphisms don't exist, but such
equivalences do.)

bon jour, Jim Otto

The result goes back to Claude Chevalley's seminar. (One direction
does require the Axiom of Choice.) I think a simple formulation is in
J.Gray's paper on fibrations in the proceedings of La Yolla
conference, Springer 1965.
