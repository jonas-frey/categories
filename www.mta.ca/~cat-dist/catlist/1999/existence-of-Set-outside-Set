Can one prove the existence of Set in "any other" category?

More specifically, if category theory is developed *entirely* within
the topos of reflexive graphs (for a suitable notion of "entirely"),
can one still prove that there exists a category with four adjoints
left of Yoneda?  This is of course Rosebrugh and Woods' nifty one-axiom
characterization of Set, which one might call the uvwxy theorem.
(Automata theory also has a uvwxy theorem, namely the pumping lemma for
context-free languages, making the name context-sensitive...)
