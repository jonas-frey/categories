Subject: associativity and commutativity of addition

It is well-known that a category in which finite products exist and
coincide with finite coproducts (i.e. a zero object exists and the
binary product functor is naturally equivalent to the binary
coproduct functor) is semi- additive, i.e. enriched over the monoidal
closed category of commutative monoids. Conversely, in a semi-
additive category, every (existing) finite product is automatically a
finite coroduct in the canonical way (an vice versa). Now my student
Claus Kirschner observed that the proof of the latter fact does not
use associativity and commutativity of the addition. Strange enough,
together with the first fact this means: If a category with finite
products has an operation called "addition" with neutral element 0 on
each hom-set satisfying f0=0f=0 and the distributive laws, then the
addition is automatically associative and commutative. Has anyone
ever seen this before?
   Of course, finite products (or coproducts) are essential;
otherwise one can easily construct single-object counterexamples. On
the other hand, Hilbert observes something similar but different in
an appendix to his book "Grundlagen der Geometrie": For unital rings,
the commutativity of addition follows from the other axioms; one can
even relax the exisence of the additive inverse to cancellation
conditions. The argument is as follows:
x+x+y+y=(1+1)x+(1+1)y=(1+1)(x+y)=1(x+y)+1(x+y)=x+y+x+y
Cancelling x on the left and y on the right, we get x+y=y+x.
Does anybody know more about  similar implications?

This interesting remark illustrates a general algebraic phenomenon that
occurs when dealing with "unitary" theories or sketches. The most
well-known example is about internal groups in the category Gr of groups :
they are automatically
commutative (in the appropriate sense). Another example : internal "non
necessarily associative categories" in Gr are automatically associative.

On the other hand, an internal semigroup in the category Semigr of
semigroups need not be commutative; this is the reason why Semigr has many
multiplicative closed structures while Gr (or Mon, the category of monoids)
has none.

Unitary and non-unitary algebraic theories definitely have a very different
behaviour; this is one of the reasons why I think that the theory of
taxonomies (i.e. "categories without identities") should be taken more
seriously!

I guess someone has to say it for the record. The question:

  If a category with finite products has an operation called
  "addition" with neutral element 0 on each hom-set satisfying f0=0f=0
  and the distributive laws, then the addition is automatically
  associative and commutative. Has anyone ever seen this before?

Yes, starting at least with Eckmann/Hilton in the 50's.
