    We show that there is a certain variety (= category tripleable over
sets) and a simple Horn sentence in it of the form phi(u) = phi(v) ==>
psi(u) = psi(v) whose category of models is equivalent to the opposite
of topological spaces.  The theory consists of that of frames together
with a unary operation we denote ' (it is a kind of pseudocomplement)
satisfying a small set of equations plus an equation scheme that forces
all intervals of the form [u /\ u',u \/ u'] to be complete atomic
boolean algebras with the Sup and ' as operations.  The underlying set
functor on Top\op takes a space to the set of all pairs (U,A) where U is
open and A is an arbitrary subset of U. The frame operations are the
usual, while (U,A)' = (U,U - A).  The Horn clause is u \/ u' \/ 1' = v
\/ v' \/ 1' ==> u \/ u' = v \/ v'.

There is a related result which (since it makes no mention of Horn
clauses, this result of Barr and Pedicchio apparently extends,
yet, nonetheless) may be of interest:


For each topological space B, the contravariant hom-functor Top(-,B) :
Top^op -----> Sets is of descent type, if and only if, the space B
contains a two-point indiscrete subspace, that is, a pair of points which
in the topology on B are contained in the same open sets, and a copy of
the Sierpinski space. The first condition is sufficient to ensure that,
for each topological space X, the canonical counit map X -----> B^Top(X,B)
is an injection, and the second ensures that it is the embedding of a
subspace. That these conditions are each necessary is easily checked. 
Each such space gives rise to an algebraic theory Th_B, as well as a
comparison Top^op -----> B-Alg, exhibiting Top^op as a full reflective
subcategory of, and hence tripleable over, the category of algebras B-Alg.

This particular algebraic theory to which you refer is perhaps
exactly that arising from the space B having three points, one of
which is closed, with open complement (containing the other two points)
as the only non-trivial open.
