In his recent
Action du groupe des tresses sur une categorie
Deligne considers more genrally an action of
a monoid M (n'ayant pas necessairement d'unite')!!
on a category C
 
the major point is, of course, that the fucntion
T: M --> Functors(C,C)
satisfies Tf Tg is isomorphic to T(fg) not =
but that the isomorphisms are STRICTLY coherent for
fgh
 
most of his attack is through generators and relations
for speciifc examples of interest
 
the pictures for the monoid of strictly positive braids
are neat
 
but hasn't this sort of thing been investigatged much more generally?
 
and what about the case of weak coherence (cf. higher homotopies)?
 
any references would be welcome

Dear Jim
 
I don't see the big deal about not having a unit in the monoid when looking
at (pseudo-)actions; throw one in - we know how it should act.  If you
agree to this then what you are looking at is a pseudofunctor (or
homomorphism of bicategories)  R : M --> Cat  where  M  is the monoid
regarded as a one-object category.  Indeed,  M  can be any category.  There
is an equivalence between the 2-category  Hom(M,Cat)  of homomorphisms from
M  to Cat  and the 2-category  Fib/M  of opfibrations over  M.
 
The study of fibrations has gone off in many directions: for example, it
provides the appropriate way of dealing with categories of all sizes (not
just small) when working in a topos.
 
As to higher homotopies, Cat doesn't really have enough dimensions for
them. But there are trihomomorphisms  M --> Bicat.  More generally, there
will be higher homomorphisms  M --> WOC  where  WOC  is the weak
omega-category of weak omega-categories - someday  - for now we have
several fairly good definitions of the objects and arrows of  WOC  but
that's as far as it goes.  Higher fibrations is another interesting topic:
Claudio Hermida knows about the 2-category case which is relevant to braids
since 2-opfibrations over a 2-category  M  correspond to homomorphisms  M
--> 2-Cat  where  2-Cat  is self-enriched via the internal hom for the Gray
tensor product of 2-categories (and it is in proving the coherence for this
tensor product where braid groups first seriously entered category theory).
 
Also, consider any braided monoidal bicategory  B  and let  t  be the n-th
tensor power of some object of  B.  Then there is an action of the kind you
describe of the n-string braid group on the hom-category  B(t,t).  But this
is part of a longer story.

An addition  to Ross Street's answer.

Wilst the notion of weak \omega-functor is not yet worked out adequately
the corresponding topological theory of A_{\infty} and E_{\infty} maps
between A_{\infty} and E_{\infty}-spaces has been constructed by
Boardman,Vogt, May, Segal and others.
 The theory of natural transformations up to ALL higher homotopies between
simplicial functors has been developed by Dawer,Kan,
Cordier, Porter, Bourn, Batanin, Heller and others.
  Simplicial A_{\infty}-categories and A_{\infty}-functors were defined and
studied by Batanin and topological version of it by Schwanzl and Vogt (they
call them \Delta-categories and use the idea related to the Segal delooping
mashine.)

where the applicaitons are to Floer cohomology if I recall
and thence to physics!
