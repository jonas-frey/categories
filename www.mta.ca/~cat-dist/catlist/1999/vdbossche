Dear colleagues,

I have the painful mission to announce that our colleague and friend
Gilberte Van den bossche died saturday night, after a long illness.

All those who visited Louvain-la-Neuve, all those who met her at various
international meetings have always been impressed by her kindness and her
highly developed sense of social contacts.

She has produced in her scientific life very nice pieces of mathematics, on
derived functors, locales, localizations, Gelfand rings and more recently,
quantale theory. She was also an exceptional teacher, highly appreciated by
her students.

Her disparition is a great pain for all the members of the Louvain-la-Neuve
category theory seminar, and a true scientific loss.

Francis Borceux

I can't begin to say how sorry I am to hear of Gilberte's death. She was
one of the most delightful people that I had the pleasure of knowing at
Louvain la Neuve. I will never forget her answer to my question (on
learning that she was native to the other side of the linguistic divide),
"What was she doing in Louvain la Neuve?". With a twinkle in her eye, she
replied," Je suis espionne!" We will all miss her, not only for her
mathematics, but for who she was as a person. Please give my sympathy to
her family and friends.  Sincerely, Jack Duskin, SUNY Buffalo
