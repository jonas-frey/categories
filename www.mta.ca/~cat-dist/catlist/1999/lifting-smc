This was done in Brian Day's thesis [D1]. It is accessible in [D2], [D3].
Starting with any monoidal category C with tensor product #, we obtain a
promonoidal category C with P(a,b,c) = C(a#b,c). Then the presheaf category
C^ becomes a (left and right) closed cocomplete monoidal category under the
convolution tensor product; the Yoneda embedding y : C --> C^ is strong
monoidal (preserves tensor). In fact, this is the universal monoidal
cocompletion (see [IK]). If C is symmetric, so is C^ and y preserves
the symmetry.
