Do cartesian monads preserve pullbacks. May be with some extra
conditions such as finitariness?

Thanks for any help/references

I asked the question

without properly defining what I meant by a cartesian monad. What I
mean was that the unit and multiplication of the monad are cartesian
natural transformations, ie the associated naturality squares are
pullbacks.

Soory for the confusion
