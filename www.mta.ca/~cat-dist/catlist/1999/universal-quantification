Subject: categories: two questions about universal quantification 
From: Barry Jay <cbj@socs.uts.edu.au>


Can anyone help with the following two questions? 
Barry Jay



Question 1 
~~~~~~~~~~

Has the following lemma been seen before? 

Lemma: If D is a cartesian closed category having all finite limits
then so is its arrow category.

Proof

Finite limits in the arrow category are constructed pointwise. 
Arrows from a: A -> I to b: B-> J In the arrow category are given by
commuting squares (all vertical lines are arrows pointing down)

      f
  A -----> B
  |        |
 a|        |b
  |        |
  I -----> J
      u

The object of such appropriate pairs (f,u) is given by the pullback

  E -----> A->B
  |         |
  |         | A->b
  |         |
 I->J ---> A->J
     a->J

The universal property follows directly. QED

The proof uses a form of universal quantification over A.
Similar constructions arise with the use of ends and dinatural
transformations. I also used them aggresively in my paper on data
categories (http://linus/~cbj/Publications/data_categories.ps.gz) to
quantify over all paths through a tree. The lemma generalises to other
functor categories over D provided there are sufficient limits in D to
express all of the constraints.


Question 2 
~~~~~~~~~~

The proof above shows how pullbacks and cartesian closure interact to
provide a form of universal quantification.  Call this new
construction quantification by exponentiation. What is its expressive
power?

Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~

Universal quantification wrt an arrow f : X -> Y is usually given as a
right adjoint to the functor D/Y --> D/X which pulls back along f.
Call this quantification by adjunction. When it is specialised to a
projection XxY ---> X then it can be thought of as quantification over
the object Y. Quantification by exponentiation can be seen as
supplying some of the ingredients necessary for this special case. For
example, consider the equaliser E of two functions into an
exponential:

  f,g : X --> (A->B)

If the quantifier by adjunction exists for the projection XxA ---> X
then E is given by applying it to the equaliser of the uncurried forms
of f and g from XxA to B. 
  
Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

One the one hand, this structure is weaker than that normally assumed,
which may sometimes be a good thing. On the other hand, the power
resulting from this combination of features may still be more than
desired.

Many models of computation assume both cartesian closure and and all
finite limits but this is already more than we need to model the types
of most languages, i.e. a type corresponding to one of the objects
produced by quantification by exponentiation would have undecidable
membership, so that values would need to come equipped with a proof of
their membership. So (assuming that cartesian closure is a given) the
question becomes whether there is a smaller class of limits which are
good enough to model programming languages. 

One candidate is to work in an extensive category, in which only
pullbacks along coproduct inclusions are presumed. A short argument
shows that if Z has decidable equality then any cospan over it has a
pullback. Actually, there is a rich, but under-explored class of
pullbacks implied by this innocuous assumption. For example, the list
functor preserves such pullbacks (this is not quite trivial). There
may well be other, better candidates. I would be glad to hear of them.

This is a special case of the cartesian closedness of a category 
obtained by Artin glueing, which was covered in the Carboni--Johnstone
paper (Math. Struct. Comp. Sci. 5 (1995), 441--459). (However, we don't
claim any originality for it; it is implicit in Gavin Wraith's 1974
paper on Artin glueing.) Of course, the "glueing functor" in Barry's case
is the identity on D.

If I've not misunderstood Barry's question 1, this is surely just the 
gluing or sconing lemma for the particular functor id_D : D -> D, 
where

     Glue(id_D) = arrow(D)

Gluing along the identity gives a pleasant form for exponentials; the
glued exponentials in Glue(G) for some G : C -> D collapse to the diagram
in Barry's note.

Subject: categories: Barry Jay's question

Unless I am missing something, it seems to me that for any CCC C with
finite limits and any finite category I, the functor category C^I is a
CCC.  You can also replace finite by any cardinal if you do it in both
places.  The argument is roughly this.  Let |I| denote the discrete
category with the objects of I.  The inclusion |I| --> I induces U: C^I
--> C^{|I|} and the limits imply the existence of a right adjoint R of U.
Since U also preserves limits, the cotriple (UR,e,d) preserves finite
limits.  It is easy to see that U is cotripleable and that C^{|I|} is a
CCC and, hence, so is C^I.  For define A -o RC = R(UA -o C).  For a
general object B, the line B --> URB ==> URURB is an equalizer and you can
define A -o B as the equalizer of A -o URB ==> A -o URURB.

Subject: categories: Artin glueing et cetera; comments of Barr, Jay, Crole, and Johnstone


Barry Jay recently sought comments on A^2 is cartesian closed when A is so,
where 2 is the arrow-category. Roy Crole and Peter Johnstone both pointed
out that this was a special case of Artin glueing.

Is there not a more general fact? The forgetful 2-functor from cartesian-
closed categories to categories is fairly easily seen to be monadic - the
monadicity is well-known for categories with finite products or finite
limits, and adding the right adjoint to (- x A) is purely equational. But
for any 2-monad T on K, T-Alg has all lax and pseudo limits - indeed all
flexible limits - formed as in K; see [Blackwell, Kelly, and Power, Two-
-dimensional monad theory, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 50 (1989), 1-41]. Artin
glueing is the case of the lax limit of a map, if I remember correctly its
meaning. But (-)^X for any category X is also a flexible limit, so that
Jay's observation is included directly without recourse to Artin glueing.

Then, again, Michael Barr on 30 Jan asserts that A^X is cartesian closed if
A is so when X is finite and A has finite limits. Surely such conditions are
not needed - A^X is cartesian closed when A is so.

Am I missing something?

From: maxk@maths.usyd.edu.au (Max Kelly)
Subject: categories: my earlier comments on certain limits in algebras for a 2-category.

After returning home and checking my references, I see that in [Blackwell,
Kelly, Power] we show that, for a 2-monad T on a complete 2-category K, the
category T-Alg, whose morphisms are the non-strict ones (the "to within a
coherent isomorphism" ones), admits products, inserters, and equifiers,
formed as in K, and hence such limits as follow from these, including the
cotensor product (-)^X for an X in K. What I said today about admitting all
FLEXIBLE limits is false; I had misremembered, and there is a counter-
-example in Example 6.2 of [Bird, Kelly, Power, Street, Flexible limits for
2-categories, JPAA 61 (1989), 1 - 27]. The flexibles would follow from those
above if idempotents were to split - but they don't in general.

I am strongly convinced that the above is true. The mere CATEGORY Ccc of
cartesian closed categories was shown to be monadic over the mere category
Cato of categories by Burroni, and this was checked and restated by Dubuc
and Kelly in [J. Algebra 81 (1983), 420 - 433]. Blackwell, Kelly, and Power
claimed on p.39 of [B,K,P] that Ccc, as a 2-category with only invertible
2-cells, is monadic (2-monadic, if you want the repeated emphasis) over the
complete 2-category Catg which is obtained from the 2-category Cat by
discarding all the non-invertible 2-cells. It is most unlikely that Ccc is
2-monadic over the usual 2-category Cat; for already symmetric monoidal
closed categories is known not to be so; see p.34 of [B,K,P].

I had strongly believed that Ccc was indeed 2-monadic over Catg; but we never
checked every detail of this particular example. Today my belief has been
shaken by two letters (one from Barry Jay) claiming that the monadicity of 
Ccc is false, unless the cartesian closed categories are supposed to admit
pullbacks. I shall try to check this out in the coming days - we were quite
sure that the structure is equational even without pullbacks, but perhaps we
were wrong. Certainly Burroni (see [Dubuc-Kelly for the reference) supposed
pullbacks present, because he was headed for toposes.

I must say that the letters I received today were imprecise about which
base 2-category was involved; to be fair, they were not really about 
monadicity but about the existence of A^2. However I formed theimpression
that the 2-categorical investigations in the references above have not (yet?)
become part of the common language of our colleagues. Note that the T-Alg
where these limits are to exist does NOT have the strict maps; so that it is
certainly not monadic in any classical sense. Clearly one cannot begin even
to pose such questions precisely without using 2-categorical notions. Let me
finish by saying that the universal property of A^2 is 2-categorical by its
very nature (if we are speaking of A^2 in T-alg, not just in Cat).

Oh, that's it! I have just seen what the point is. [B,K,P] is quite right in
asserting that Ccc has the limit A^2 formed as in Catg; but the limit A^2 in
Catg is not at all that in Cat; it is the category such that to give
B --> A^2 is to give two maps B --> A and a 2-cell between them; but the
2-cells in Catg are just the INVERTIBLE natural transformations, so that
A^2 in Catg is A^I in Cat, where I is the free isomorphism, not the free a
arrow 2.

So, all right, I give in. The [B,K,P] results don't give a cartesian closed
structure on the USUAL A^2 in Cat. Anyway, I've learned (or relearned)
something from thinking this through, and hope some others may benefit from
seeing these notions brought up.

And so to bed. Max Kelly.
