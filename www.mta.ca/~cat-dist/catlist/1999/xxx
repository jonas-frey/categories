Is it really true that algebraic geoemtry is flourishing that much better
than algebraic topology not to mention CT = category theory!!

If you are unfamiliar with the archive, try to xxx.lanl.gov
home page or contact me.

There is 1 with primary category CT and 7 cross-listed into CT in
1998.  A second CT paper dated 1995 is from the migration of the MSRI
preprint series.  Jim's table, which was forwarded from xxx staff,
counts only primary submissions, to avoid double-counting.  You can get a
clear picture at

    http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.CT

I should say that the main consequences so far of creating CT has been
a lot of theorizing about the categories in the xxx mathematics archive.
Perhaps that's a natural response from category theorists, but it's not
what the people who created CT had in mind.

The number of submissions to xxx.lanl.gov seems more driven by culture
than anything else.  The following are the number of submissions for
1998 to date:

	Astrophysics: 		2225
	Condensed Matter	2272
	  + 10 more physics areas
	Mathematics (total)	932
	Computation & Language	48

Evidently very few computer scientists think to submit to xxx.lanl.gov.
I wouldn't infer from those numbers that computer science is not
flourishing or publishing.

As far as algebraic geometry vs category theory goes, the most recent
5 submissions in those respective areas span 1 week vs. 11 weeks,
suggesting that the recent rate of submissions is closer to 11:1 than
221:1.  (I'd have taken a larger sample if one had been as handy as the
most-recent-5 statistic.)

Although this might indeed well be true, isn't is a bit too simplistic to
measure the succes of a subject this way?

I think that for a more balanced view it is useful to consider the
following points:
1. CT is a new subject class, and naturally has lower traffic than the
well established ones,
2. There are cross references to CT from other classes,
3. There are papers containing some category theory classified under
other classes; some of these could well have been classified CT (remember
that the author determines the subject class!),
4. The position of Category Theory in Mathematics is quite different from
Algebraic Geometry's (more marginal??),
5. The categorical community is relatively small, so categorists might
be thinking they don't need a preprint archive,
6. Category Theory is less "time-sensitive" than other subjects, so
categorists don't rush off to get their preprints time-stamped (as I
have heard rumoured is the practice among (mathematical) physicists),
7. And there's the compulsory-tex-source-submission issue ...

[note from moderator: a response to this has been posted, but the original
was inadvertently delayed]

Jim, 
   There is something wrong (probably internal at
xxx.lanl.gov) with your table of '98 abstracts in
various branches of math. I went there (for the
first time, thanks for the address) and clicked
on Category Theory and found 5 abstracts. Those
were all from the 3 months preceding this month,
so I thought there should be more in '98. I did
a search for the words 'category theory',
limited to '98, and got 8 abstracts. However,
more than half of those were classified,
primarily, as Quantum Groups or something. So
God only knows how many CT's there are in lanl
in '98, but not less than 5.

I may have given the wrong impression:

Ginsparg writes:
  note that "Computation & Language" is not  
  a comprehensive archive for all of Computer Science and all of Linguistics.
  it is a small archive started in '94, corresponding to just a small subject  
  class of computer science, devoted to a very specific sub-area involving  
  language. as such

	 note that later this month we *will* be starting a  
  comprehensive cs archive along the lines of what was done in math, and its  
  advisory board, formed from an ACM committee early this year, has repeated
  many of the deliberations regarding the most effective partitioning,
  and its relation to the existing ACM classification scheme. (in the end
  the primary level is likely to reflect instead their conference structure.)
  the aim is to evolve that much more quickly to a set of mirrored
  comprehensive resources for physics, math and computer science -- presuming
  the latter two eventually choose to participate at the same level as the
  former... it is partly true that these are culture driven, but these cultures
  evolve: the examples of Astrophysics and Condensed Matter both started
  quite slowly six years ago (in comparison to High Energy Physics which
  took off instantly in '91 and saturated by late '93, essentially 100%
  participation) but those two each more than doubled their submission
  rates from '94-'96 and have continued (though Astrophysics is now nearing
  saturation as well), so these cultures are capable of adapting if it
  suits their research purposes.

One correspondent writes:

for example, there's only one paper per year classified as "Category  
Theory" (currently there's only math.CT/9805102), then we conclude that
either
a) no papers suitable for that classification are being written, 
b) the people writing those papers are unaware of the archive, 
c) they're aware of it but prefer not or are too busy to use it, or 
d) they're actively boycotting it.

I'm hoping that c) is the reason and not d). Listing with 
xxx.lanl.gov in noway precludes or detracts from the use of e.g. hypatia
