Subject: categories: Monoidal structure on graphs

Greetings, fellow categorists.

I'm wondering, if anybody has ever described the following monoidal
structure on the category of oriented multigraphs, what MacLane calls
graphs, the most common kind of graph in category theory (but not
everywhere) :

Given mgs X, Y, the set |X-oY| of vertices on  X-oY  is the set of mg
morphisms
X --> Y.

Given f,g : X --> Y the set of arrows f-->g is the set of pairs
(p_0,p_1) of functions such that

forall  x in |X|, p_0(x) : f-->g

forall  k: x-->y in X, p_1(k) : f(x)-->g(y)

This co-contra bifunctor has a tensor left adjoint, which is symmetric
and monoidal. 

I would be quite surprised if this structure had never been seen before.
Enriched universal algebra in there has applications in computer
science.

Thanks,

Francois Lamarche

A structure closely related to the one which Francois Lamarche
asked about appeared in my thesis (1992) [see below] as a simple example of
a sesqui-category which is not a 2-category. I too would expect
it's appeared elsewhere, but I don't know where.

John Stell

\subsubsection{An Example of a Sesqui-Category}
We include an example to show that there are naturally occurring
sesqui-categories other than in connection with modelling
term rewriting. The underlying 
category is {\bf Graph}. Suppose there are graphs $G$ and $H$, and
graph morphisms $g,h : G \rightarrow H$. In this situation, the 2-cells
$\alpha : g \rightarrow h$ are assignments to each node $n$ of $G$ of a
path of edges from $ng$ to $nh$ in $H$. 

The compositions $\circ_R$ and 
$\circ_L$ are readily defined. If $f : F \rightarrow G$ then 
$f \circ_R \alpha$ assigns to a node $m$ of $F$ the path $(mf)\alpha$ in $H$.
For the left composition, suppose we have $k : H \rightarrow K$.
Since $n\alpha$ is a path in $H$, we obtain a path $(n\alpha)k$ by applying
$k$ to each of the edges in the path $n \alpha$. Thus we define 
$\alpha \circ_L k$ to be the assignment to $n$ of the path $(n \alpha)k$.

The vertical composition is the usual concatenation of paths. The identity
2-cells are assignments of zero length paths.

Given the private replies I got to yesterday's queries, it is obvious I

OK Saunders, from now on they're graphs. This what happens when you hang
out with combinatorists AND category theorists.

So right from the start this is not the usual presheaf CC structure,
where the set of vertices is the set of all functions |X| --> |Y| .

So in what follows I use categorical notation for vertices, arrows, etc.
 
> Given f,g : X --> Y the set of arrows f-->g is the set of pairs
> (p_0,p_1) of functions such that

> forall  x in |X|, p_0(x) : f(x)-->g(x)

> forall  k: x-->y in X, p_1(k) : f(x)-->g(y)

Now the typo has been corrected. So an arrow f --> g is like a natural
transformation, with p_0 the usual familly of arrows indexed by the
vertices/objects of X, but since things don't compose, you add the
diagonal p_1 as part of the information. There is some kinship to
homotopies, as M. Barr has remarked.

Is this more understandable?

Subject: categories: Re: Monoidal structure, take II

I did not quite understand Francois' construction.  However, my first
reaction to a question like that is that it ought to be a homotopy.  So
I will say what a homotopy reduces to in this case and leave it to
Francois to decide if this is what he has.

I suspect that rather few people know what a simplicial homotopy is and,
of those, rather few have ever actually verified one.  I am in that
minority^2, so perhaps I tend to see them where they are not the most
natural, but I think it quite remarkable that they can arise where no
real topology (but some combinatorics) is present.

I have to begin by saying how a graph becomes a simplicial set.
Actually, that is a lie, since unless you are dealing with reflexive
graphs--that are equipped with a selected loop at each vertex--you will
only get a face complex.  But homotopies are still definable.  A
category is a simplicial set by taking for n-simplexes composable
n-tuples of arrows.  This doesn't work for graphs, since the "interior
faces" (all except the lowest and highest numbered) all depend on
composition.  But there is a face complex in which an n-simplex is
simply an n-simplex in the graph.  So a 2-simplex is a
triangle--obviously non-commutative and a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron and
so on.  You can describe a composable n-tuple in a category as
commutative n-simplex, so this isn't so different.  Now given this, if
f,g:  X --> Y are graph morphisms, what is a homotopy?  Well, write X as
d^0,d^1:  X_1 --> X_0 and similarly for Y. Then f consists of f_0:  X_0
--> Y_0 and f_1:  X_1 --> Y_1 giving a serially commutative square.
Just a homomtopy between functors turns out to be simply a natural
transformation, a homotopy in this case turns out to consist of a
function p_0:  X_0 --> Y_1 and a function p_1:  X_1 --> Y_1 such that
there
is a diagram (not, of course commutative; what a diagram does is specify
source and target) as follows.  In this diagram I assume x:  x^0 --> x^1
in X, and f(x):  y^0 --> y^1 and g(x):  z^0 --> z^1 in Y.
                            f(x)
                    y^0 -----------> y^1
                     | \              |
                     |  \             |
                     |   \            |
                     |    \           |
                     |     \          |
                     |      \         |
                     |       \        |
             p_0(x^0)|  p_1(x)\       |p_0(x^1)
                     |         \      |
                     |          \     |
                     |           \    |
                     |            \   |
                     |             \  |
                     |              \ |
                     v      g(x)     vv
                    z^0 -----------> z^1

So if this is what Francois was saying, then the answer is it a homotopy
of face complexes.  Of course, if you replaced X_1 by X_1 + X_0, you
would have a reflexive graph and I assume (I have not checked this) you
would then get a simplicial homotopy.

BTW, homotopies do not generally compose--and the ones described here do
not appear to either.  Categories are special because of their internal
composition.  It makes me wonder if the well-known failure of dinats to
compose could be related to this in some way.

Having seen Francois' clarification, I think this is exactly what he
had.

On Francois Lamarche's question.

If I understand correctly, the tensor product  X tensor Y  has the obvious
objects  (x, y)  and arrows of three types

(a, y): (x, y) -->  (x', y),  for  a: x -> x'  in  X,  y  in  Y,

(x, b): (x, y) -->  (x, y'),  for  x  in  X,  b: y -> y'  in  Y,

(a, b): (x, y) -->  (x', y'),  for  a  and  b  as above.

***

Remark 1.
We are thus simulating "identities" of  X  and  Y  (which are not given).
In other words, we are considering the cartesian product  X'xY'  of the
free reflexive graphs over  X  and  Y,  and taking out its identities.

Would it not be simpler to work with  REFLEXIVE GRAPHS  and their cartesian
closed structure?
In my opinion, reflexive graphs are more natural than graphs:

reflexive graph = 1-truncated simplicial set = 1-truncated cubical set

It is the topos of presheaves over a FULL subcategory of non-empty ordinals
(or cardinals as well), actually the initial segment  1,  2.

Remark 2.
Roughly speaking, a category enriched over reflexive graphs (wrt the cc
structure) is a "2-category without vertical composition". It has cells  a:
f -> g: X -> Y,  with a categorical horizontal composition; it also has
trivial cells  f -> f: X -> Y  ("vertical identities").

All this is clearly related to homotopy and its abstract settings in
"2-dimensional categories" (in some sense).
And indeed topological spaces, with continuous maps and homotopies, form a
rather obvious example.
The horizontal composition of homotopies

   a: f -> g: X -> Y,    b: h -> k: Y -> Z

is     b(a(x, t), t)               t  in  [0, 1],

which is indeed categorical.

Remark 3.
[The sequel is relevant for homotopy; I do not know if it may be relevant
in CS, but I always had the impression that abstract homotopy should be of
use there, eg with respect to deformations of processes, in some sense.]

I do not think that the latter is the "right" 2-dimensional categorical
setting for abstract homotopy (even as a starting point).
The previous horizontal composition of homotopies is rather artificial; it
is what you get from the "double homotopy"

b(a(x, t), t')       (t, t')  in  [0, 1]^2

through the diagonal  t = t'  of the square.
(The "double homotopy" itself is quite natural, as produced by the cubical
enrichment due to the cylinder functor; it is also important in homotopy.)

When the diagonal of the "standard interval" is missing (eg for chain
complexes of abelian groups), there is no canonical horizontal composition
of homotopies (working with the vertical composition, you get two of them;
the middle four interchange does not hold). But there still are canonical
horizontal compositions of "maps with homotopies" and "homotopies with
maps".

This is why I think that the basic 2-dimensional categorical setting for
abstract homotopy should only treat such "reduced horizontal composition":
arrows with cells, cells with arrows, but NOT cells with cells.
Formally, it is again a category enriched over reflexive graphs, BUT wrt
the following monoidal closed structure:

X tensor Y:
 -  the subgraph of  XxY  whose arrows are pairs  (a, b),  where  a  or  b
is an identity;

[X, Y]:
-   vertices: the graph morhisms;
-   arrows: their transformations (without "diagonals").

abstract homotopy in:

Subject: categories: and there is a topological connection too

Various replies to my query during the day (my thanks to Ronnie Brown
and Lutz Schroeder) made me realize that my SMC structure was actually
the lifting of the CC structure on reflexive graphs (those with a choice
of loop) to ordinary non-reflexive graphs. Here is a bit more detail:

We all know these two categories are categories of presheaves. So let G
and R be the categories such that Set^G is graphs and  Set^R is
reflexive graphs. There is an embedding  G --> R, which generates the
usual triple of functors between the presheaf categories. So it seems
this functorial machinery allows to transform the CC structure in Set^R
into an SMC structure in Set^G, preserving the forgetful functor. There
must be general conditions that allow this.

I'm not pursuing this any more right now, because it has to have been
done before, and in a much more general setting.

Now Michael's comment is also (among other things) about the tension
between graphs and reflexive graphs, and naturally there is Lawvere's
"Qualitative distinctions between some toposes of generalized graphs"
that says a lot about that tension.

there may be more in there than we suspect

The answer is no, because of the application in mind. We want to
consider a graph as a constructive binary relation X(x,y), where an edge
x-->y is a proof that (x,y) are related. We also want to build such
things by induction, using universal properties. Reflexivity is often a
desirable feature of the free structures you want to build, but you
don't want it to come for free, since it creates redundancies and can
mess up the induction principle associated with the structure. In
certain situations you want reflexivity to be a consequence of the
induction principle.

There are two connections I know about between homotopy and computer
science. The first has to do with process algebras, and originates in
Eric Goubault's thesis, I think. Philippe Gaucher just sent a paper
annoucement on this server about this line of research.

The second connection is something Thomas Streicher, Martin Hoffmann and
I discuss whenever we meet, which is not often enough. In constructive
type theory there is a gadget called the Martin-L"of intensional
equality predicate, J(x,y). So this is a version of equality, where you
have to name the proofs that x=y. It has very simple (but rather
mysterious) introduction and elimination rules, which can be translated
as a universal property in a kind of higher-order universal algebra,
where arities can not only be seen as finite sets, but also as families
of sets, and families of families of sets and so on. In particular,
since everything is a type, you have a type/predicate of equality proofs
between equality proofs, and so on. For example given proofs that x=y
and y=z, you can construct a proof that x=z, and you can do this
uniformly, getting a term/algorithm  J(x,y)*J(y,z) --> J(x,z) (here the
* means a fibered product over y). But you cannot show that this
operation is itself associative, it is only associative at a higher
order. Ah! some kind of multiple category is involved! But so far all
attempts to use higher-order categories to describe those weird algebras
have failed. It only works at level one: when you collapse all proofs of
equality between proofs of equality you get that the predicate J(x,y) is
a groupoid structure. But when you try to go to level 2 the ordinary 2-
or bi- or lax- or whatever- categorical machinery fails. You realize
that simplicial sets are a better paradigm/starting point, but we need
simplicial sets with operations.

BTW is anybody from G"oteborg reading this?

Hm... the geometrical motivations for not having full composition(s)
here might well be related to the logical ones I mentioned briefly

I wonder whether the notion of "h4-category" which I introduced for
abstract homotopy theory (see the references in my first reply) might be of
use for this.

It is a sort of "2-category vertically relaxed up to a 'shadow' of 3-cells"
(whereas bi-categories are horizontally relaxed up to invertible 2-cells).

To begin with, it is a category enriched over reflexive graphs in the sense
previously described: there is a reduced horizontal composition, of maps
with cells and cells with maps, which is strictly associative as far as
this makes sense.
There also are vertical identities, vertical involution and vertical
composition, which only satisfy the usual axioms up to an assigned
equivalence relation ("2-homotopy").
This approach is truncated at the level of usual (first-order) homotopies;
3-cells (homotopies of homotopies) only leave their 'shadow', as an
equivalence relation.

If you want to proceed further, my impression is that the relaxed
categorical machinery becomes too heavy (at least for my taste). However,
if your 2-cells (homotopies) can be represented

- by a cylinder functor  I,  as arrows  IX -> Y,
- or dually by a path functor  P,  as arrows  X -> PY,
     (or by both, forming an adjoint pair  I -| P)

as it happens for most "concrete" homotopy theories, then the powers of
such endofunctor and the clone of operations (natural transformations)
linking them, derived from the basic ones (faces, degeneracy,
concatenation, etc.), seem to give all what we need in any dimension.
This machinery of derived operations can be seen in a paper of mine

Categorically algebraic foundations for homotopical algebra, Appl. Categ.
Structures 5 (1997), 363-413,

but of course "abstract cylinder functors" go back, at least, to Kan; other
references can be found in the paper above.

Subject: On reflexivity

A 'philosophical' interpretation of oriented graphs might be out of
the scope of the categories mailing list, it seems elucidating to me
though.(It could have been for Heraclit and Parmenides.)

I suggest to consider vertices as states and edges as transitions.

A reflexive edge corresponds to a transition from a state to itself. 

Two notions of morphism of oriented graphs come seem natural:
- A rigid embedding which preserves difference of states
- A notion of morphism which may equalize different states.
The meaning of equality of states needs precision then.

Coherence semantics deals with a different notion of graph.
This is clear to me and can also be deduced from a discussion between
Thomas Ehrhard and his student Pierre to which I assisted.

This bears an answer to the question of reflexivity I think.

	Sincerely, Tom
