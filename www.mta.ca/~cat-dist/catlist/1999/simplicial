From: Todd Wilson <twilson@CS.Cornell.EDU>

1.  A question about notation:  In accounts of internal category
theory, one uses  d_0, d_1 : C_1 -> C_0  as, respectively, domain and
codomain, in analogy (I suppose) with simplicial objects.  But then I
would have expected it to be the other way around:  in line with the
analogy of an arrow  f:A->B  as an oriented one-simplex between
vertices  A  and  B , domain should rather be the face operator  d_1
("delete 1") and codomain  d_0  ("delete 0").  Am I backwards?

2.  The category  Grp  of groups has the property that every
simplicial object in  Grp  satisfies the extension condition (i.e., is
a so-called Kan complex).  Is there a characterization of the
categories with this property?  Are there interesting uses of homotopy
in these (other) categories?

I have no opinion on the notational question.  I suppose the standard
notation is backward, but I am not going to change now.  I use d^0 and d^1,
BTW, reserving the lower index for the dimension, which in this case is 1.

If an equational category has a Mal'cev operator (a ternary operation
t with t(x,x,y) = t(y,x,x) = y), then every simplicial object is Kan.
This is essentially clear from John Moore's proof of the group case,
in which forms xy^{-1}z appear repeatedly.  For an equational category,
the converse is also true, since a special case of every simplicial
object being Kan is that every reflexive relation is an equivalence
relation, a well-known characterization of Mal'cev.

Most familiar Mal'cev categories have a group structure, so the Kan
condition follows from the case for groups.  Just about the only
familiar Mal'cev category that I can think of that lacks a group op
is Heyting algebras and I don't know any application of simplicial
Heyting algebras.

An answer may be found in

A. Carboni, G.M. Kelly, and M.C. Pedicchio, Some remarks on Maltsev and
Goursat categories,  Applied Categorical Structures 1 (1993), 385-421.

The slogan is "Kan = Maltsev".

The nerve of a groupoid (not just a group) is also a Kan complex in the strong 
sense of a simplicial T-complex (Keith Dakin's definition, 1975). A simplicial
T-complex (K,T) has sets T_n in K_n of elements called thin with the property 
that:

1) any horn has a unique thin filler
2) degenerate implies thin
3) if all faces but one of a thin element are thin, so is the last face.

This is of rank less than or equal to n if all simplices in dimensions greater 
than n are thin. Simplicial T-complexes of rank 1 are equivalent to groupoids 
(Dakin).

Simplicial T-complexes in general are equivalent to crossed complexes (Ashley, 
see Diss Math 265 (1988) Simplicial T-complexes and crossed complexes; Nan Tie,
JPAA 56 (1989) 195-209), to infinity-groupoids, and to other things. The notion
of cubical T-complex is crucial in the proof by Brown-Higgins of an 
n-dimensional Van Kampen Theorem (JPAA 22 (1981) 11-41), because of the 
technical point that it easily enables the handling of multiple compositions 
of homotopy addition lemmas (the boundary of a simplex or cube is the "sum"
of its faces) without writing down formulae. For polyhedral versions, see 
D W Jones, Diss Math 266 (1988) A general theory of polyhedral sets and the 
corresponding T-complexes.)

Part of the point is that the singular complex SX of a space X is a
Kan complex but the fillers come from the models, so ought, morally,
 to be canonical and to satisfy relations. But these relations are up to
homotopy, it seems. So it is difficult to be more precise.

The T-complex condition is very strong, but is nice in that it is easy
 to see how to weaken it. These weakenings need lots more
investigation. A further point is that a filler of a horn of a triangle
determines a product, as if it were a `computation'.

Analogous notions for categories are studied by Ross Street  and by
 Dominic Verity.

Re 1:No,You are absolutely correct if one wishes to use the usual
simplicial conventions of "face opposite" in describing the simplices of t
the simplicial object associated with the category : its "Nerve".which
provides a most convenient numbering of the projections and compositions
which occur there.However, it seems almost impossible to get people to
give up what seems to them an illogical convention for arrows which must
go from 0 to 1!

Re 2: Barr characterised these categories as those which satisfy Malcev's
condition.I have never seen his proof or know whether he ever published
it.I have one of my own since it really is not too difficult. The observation
was the ingenious part!

Subject: Kan and Maltsev


Recently, Todd Wilson asked for a characterization of those categories
wherein every simplicial object is Kan; and Michael Barr replied that
this is so for a variety if and only if it admits a Maltsev operation,
whereupon it suffices to imitate John Moore's original proof for the
category of groups. Jack Duskin also recalls this unpublished observation
of Michael's, remarking that he has his own proof. I noted that a complete
proof has been published in [A.Carboni, G.M.Kelly, and M.C.Pedicchio, Some
remarks on Maltsev and Goursat categories, Applied Categorical Structures
1(1993), 385-421]. I mention this again, since I failed to point out that
our paper shows the equivalence Kan = Maltsev for any REGULAR category,
where "Maltsev" now means that equivalence relations commute. The proof
is pretty; it does follow the lines of John Moore's, but replaces his
calculations with elements by reasonings about equivalence relations.

Max Kelly.
