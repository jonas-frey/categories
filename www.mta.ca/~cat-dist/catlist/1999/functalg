Happy New Year, everyone.

I have been wondering about a little question.  Category theory texts
talk about "algebras" for an endofunctor, which are arrows of type FA ->
A, and dually coalgebras A -> GA.  I am interested in the symmetric
case, arrows of type FA -> GA for endofunctors F and G.  
Have such structures been studied?

This is only scratching the surface.  One can ask for a family of such
arrows for an algebra.  One can consider functors F,G: C -> D between
different categories leading to algebras of the form <A, f:FA->GA> where
A is an object of C, and f an arrow in D, and so on.  I am also
interested in the "diagonal" case, arrows of type FAA -> GAA where F and
G are functors C^op x C -> C.  (Note that all these structures have a
"natural" notion of homomorphisms.)

I would appreciate any pointers to the literature.

Algebras of form FA -> GA were considered in some detail by the 
Prague school in the 1970s.  Email Jiri Adamek for precise references.

Dear Uday,

There has been an Edinburgh PhD thesis by Tatsuya Hagino on the subject of the
se dialgebras. He defines a strongly normalising lambda calculus based on 
initial terminal dialgebras and also does some general theory. 

Hope this helps, Martin

The category with objects  <A, f:FA->GA> and evident maps is sometimes 
called an inserter.  It is a weighted limit - a sort of "lax equalizer" 
of the two functors F and G: it may be written as F//G to distinguish 
it from the comma category (which is written F/G).  

It is used in the construction of datatypes (Hagino's thesis - as 
mentioned earlier - see also Dwight Spencer and my paper "Strong 
categorical datatypes II" TCS 139 (1995) 69-113 and its predecessor).
Furthermore, one can express the parametricity properties of combinators 
and modules using these categories (see Peter Vesely's MSc thesis on the 
Charity site (http:/www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/projects/charity/home.html) 
and Maarten Fokkinga's thesis - and paper in a recent MSCS issue - where 
I believe he uses the term "transformer" rather than combinator).

I recently gave a working presentation to IFIP 2.1 entitled a "A reminder 
on inserters" ... this because I felt the connection to datatypes and the 
software structuring and parametricity ramifications of this seemingly 
innocuous limit had still not been sufficiently recognized or exploited.
