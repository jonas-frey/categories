Subject: categories: looking for reference

Dear catetory theorist,


I am looking for a precise reference about the construction
of the free cubical omega category (with connnections I mean)
generated by a cubical set (I am not interested in the proof : 
I have already a proof). I just need a bibliographical 
reference. If possible in a paper easily available, not a 
preprint difficult to find :-).

Thank you in advance. pg.
