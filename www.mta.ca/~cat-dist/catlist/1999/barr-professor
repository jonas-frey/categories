=================================

It gives me great pleasure to announce to the department that
Professor Michael Barr has now been appointed as the Peter Redpath
Professor of Mathematics.  I am sure that you will join me in
congratulating him on this richly deserved honour.

This chair was previously held by Professor Edward Rosenthall,
Professor Jim Lambek (who still holds the title of Peter Redpath
Emeritus Professor) and by Professor Carl Herz.
