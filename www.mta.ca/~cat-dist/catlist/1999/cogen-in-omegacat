Subject: categories: cogenerator in omegaCat ?

Dear all, 

Does it exist a cogenerator in the category of (strict) omega-categories ?

	No, it seems not since a co-generator for omega cat
would surely give rise to one for cat in particular, but such
does not exist. This contrasts with the situation for the
"larger" universe of simplicial sets.  A category of "small"
sets is a kind of approximation to a co-generator, but each
enlargement of the meaning of "small" creates new categories
which are not co-generated.

The argument sounds reasonable. Before this question, I was 
convinced of the existence of this cogenerator. I have to find
something else for the lemma I would like to prove...

Since it does not exist, I have another questions (I suppose well-
known) and any reference abou the subject would be welcome : 

How does one prove the cocompleteness of omegaCat (small & strict) ?
The only idea of proof I had in mind until this question was : omegaCat
is obviously complete (and the forgetful functor towards the category of Sets 
preserves projective limits), and well-powered and a cogenerator 
=> the cocompleteness (Borceux I, prop 3.3.8 p 112).

Without cogenerator, how can one prove the cocompleteness ? The explicit 
construction of the colimit seems to be very hard : the forgetful
functor towards Set does not preserve colimits because the 
underlying set of the colimit might be bigger than the colimit of the
underlying sets. Every time two n-morphisms are identified in the 
colimit of the underlying sets, p-morphisms (with p>n) might be "created"
by the colimit.

Thanks in advance for any answer. pg.

I imagine that omega-categories, however defined, will be a locally
c-presentable category (c=cardinal of the continuum) in the sense of
Gabriel-Ulmer, equivalently complete and c-accessible in the sense of
Makkai-Pare and hence cocomplete.  In other words, the colimit will grow
but not by much.  Actually, aleph_1 is all you are really going to need.

In response to Ph. Gaucher's question:
  I (try to, at least...) treat this question for weak $n$-categories in
my preprint ``Limits in $n$-categories'', available on the xxx preprint
server as alg-geom 9708010. If I understand correctly, the set-theoretical
problem you raise is the same as the one encountered in section 5 of my
preprint.

The conclusion is that the (weak) $n+1$-category $nCAT$ is closed under
direct limits.

  It seems that coproducts of strict $n$-categories, if they exist,
cannot actually be the ``right'' ones because in that case, every weak
$n$-category would be equivalent to a strict one. I haven't made this
argument rigorous, though.

---Carlos Simpson

PS what is a ``comma category'' or ``comma object''?

As to the cocompleteness of Omega-Cat, it is a result of Harvey Wolff that
V-Cat is cocomplete for decent  V.  By induction, it follows that n-Cat is
cocomplete (since (n+1)-Cat = n-Cat).  A limiting process gives that
Omega-Cat is also cocomplete.

However, a better approach is to use a result of Michael Batanin that
Omega-Cat is finitarily monadic over globular sets (a presheaf category).
It follows that  Omega-Cat  is cocomplete.

The required monad on globular sets is beautiful: it involves plane trees. See:

theory of weak n-categories, Advances in Mathematics 136 (1998) 39-103.
