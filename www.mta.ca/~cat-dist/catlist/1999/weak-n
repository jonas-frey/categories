It occurred to me that some people on this list might be
interested in seeing the definition of weak n-categories
proposed by James Dolan and myself.  We are very slowly
writing a paper on this, which will appear as part of
the series "Higher-dimensional algebra" in Adv. Math..
(The first paper in this series is on braided monoidal
2-categories, and the second will be on 2-Hilbert spaces.)
However, a sketch of the definition has been available on
the web for some time; it's at

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ncat.def.html

Also, a bunch of expository material on mathematical
physics, category theory and so on can be found at

Sincerely,
John Baez

Higher-Dimensional Algebra III:
n-Categories and the Algebra of Opetopes

John C. Baez and James Dolan

We give a definition of weak n-categories based on the theory of
operads.  We work with operads having an arbitrary set S of types, or
`S-operads', and given such an operad O, we denote its set of
operations by elt(O).  Then for any S-operad O there is an
elt(O)-operad O+ whose algebras are S-operads over O.  Letting I be
the initial operad with a one-element set of types, and defining I(0)
= I, I(i+1) = I(i)+, we call the operations of I(n-1) the
`n-dimensional opetopes'.  Opetopes form a category, and presheaves on
this category are called `opetopic sets'.  A weak n-category is
defined as an opetopic set with certain properties, in a manner
reminiscent of Street's simplicial approach to weak omega-categories.
In a similar manner, starting from an arbitrary operad O instead of I,
we define `n-coherent O-algebras', which are n times categorified
analogs of algebras of O.  Examples include `monoidal n-categories',
`stable n-categories', `virtual n-functors' and `representable
n-prestacks'.  We also describe how n-coherent O-algebra objects may
be defined in any (n+1)-coherent O-algebra.

The paper is 59 pages long, so this file is rather large.  
A compressed version is available at

You can download this and then (on most UNIX systems) type

uncompress op.ps.Z

to get the Postscript file.

ABSTRACT

Notions of `operad' and `multicategory' abound. This work provides a single
framework in which many of these various notions can be expressed.
Explicitly: given a monad * on a category S, we define the term
(S,*)-multicategory, subject to certain conditions on S and *.  Different
choices of S and * give some of the existing notions. We then describe the
algebras for an (S,*)-multicategory, and finish with a selection of possible
further developments. Our approach enable concise descriptions of Baez and
Dolan's opetopes and Batanin's operads; both of these are included.

Those people interested in Tom Leinster's paper on multicategories and
weak higher dimensional categories might also be interested in recent,
closely related work by Claudio Hermida at McGill. I do not think
there is a paper available yet, but he has given talks at Vancouver
and at the recent meeting of the Canadian Math Society in Montreal, so
there are probably slides available.
