Is there a good reference somewhere for the definition of
a "pseudonatural transformation" between strict 2-functors between
2-categories, and of a "modification" between such pseudonatural
transformations?  In Springer Lecture Notes 420, Kelly and Street
define lax natural transformations between strict 2-functors,
and (apparently following Benabou) modifications between strict natural
transformations.  The definitions I want are hopefully straightforward
modifications of these, but I don't actually know if anyone has given
them anywhere.  Perhaps it's up to me?

As John Baez points out, a "pseudonatural transformation between strict
2-functors between 2-categories" is just the obvious particular case of a
lax natural transformation; the paper by Kelly-Street he refers too, in
SLNM 420, provides a general, coherent terminology for relaxed
2-categorical notions, as well as references to their earlier appearences.
I think it already provides the reference he is looking for.

The following paper might contain things connected with his interests. A
definition of the precise cases he is interested in, pseudonatural
transformations and their modifications, is written out in S 0.6

In the groupoid case a theory of higher homotopies is written out in terms
of the monoidal
closed structures on the categories of \omega-groupoids (=
``cubical'' \omega-groupoids with connections, in some other terminology)
and the equivalent category of crossed complexes in the paper
R.  BROWN and  P.J. HIGGINS, ``Tensor products and homotopies for
$\omega$-groupoids and crossed complexes'', {\em J. Pure Appl.
Alg.}, 47 (1987) 1-33.

In these categories, we easily deal with ``lax equivalences'' as
``homotopies'', i.e. maps C \otimes I \to D, where I is the usual unit
interval groupoid. Since these categories are equivalent to that of
``globular'' infinity- (omega?)-groupoids, (Brown and Higgins, CTGDC, 1981)
one gets a corresponding theory there, but without such explicit formulae.
So I suppose it is not quite so clear this theory extends the
lax 2-groupoid theory, but it seems highly likely.

There are quite a few recent applications of these methods, for example to
coherent and to equivariant homotopy theory. See for example

R. Brown,  M. Golasinski, T.Porter and A.P.Tonks), ``On function
spaces of equivariant maps and the equivariant homotopy theory
of crossed complexes''.

A.P. Tonks, ``Theory and applications of crossed complexes'',
Bangor PhD Thesis, 1993.

I expect that recent work of Crans, Steiner, Street et al (not all
together) gives a category version of
these groupoid formulations for the omega-category case, but
for the cubical version (preferably with connections?) it all seems clear,
since
one uses cubes to define tensor.
