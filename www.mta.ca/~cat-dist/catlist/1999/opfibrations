Suppose you have coloured graphs G,H (with multiple edges,
etc. i.e., we are in the topos of coloured graphs). A morphism
G->H induces a functor between the free categories generated
by G and H. I am interested in those morphisms which induce
discrete opfibrations. Has anyone studied this notion?
Essentially, any arc f(x)->y of H can be lifted uniquely
to an arc (with the same label) x->x', for some x' such
that f(x')=y.
