Those interested in real-world applications of categories are advised
considering the following. There is a natural (and strictly defined) sense in
which a Heyting algebra is assigned to a Lie group with a family of (proper
and/or pseudo)-Riemannian metrics over it (V. Trifonov, Europhysics Letters
32, 7, pp.621-626, 1995):
<http://www.ed-phys.fr/articles/euro/abs/1995/32/8/ep32801/ep32801.html>.
Initially the result was motivated by the Four-Dimensionality Problem in
physics (1.Why does spacetime look four-dimensional?). It turnes out,
however, that it gives concise (the paper is letter-sized)  and elegant
solutions to at least four other difficult problems:
2.Why is the effective metric Lorentzian?
3.Why does it look like there was a big bang?
4.Why are only three matter generations observable?
5.Why does the arrow of time exist?
To-date this remains the only solution of the Four-Dimensionality Problem and
the Metric Signature Problem (2). For details see recent posts in
sci.math.research and sci.physics.research. We need your expertise.
