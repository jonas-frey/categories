Dear categorists,
for my thesis I am interested in ccpo, effective F-spaces and recursion
theory on some particular domain like cpo and "effective sets ".
If you know any e-mail address of a group of people working in these
 areas, please send it to me so that I can contact them; in particular I'm
also interested in some different formulation of recursive ( effective )
operator ( different e.g. from Rogers ).
Some address of paper available on FTP over these subjects are also needed.
If you can help me e-mail at this recipient or at my e-mail
bovetti@educ.di.unito.it

THANKS YOU ALL.
