                CATEGORIES INFORMATION ON THE WEB

****************************************************************************

Subscribers to this list who have access to the World Wide Web may now
access the archives of the categories list, link to ftp sites of
interest and sources for diagram macros by pointing to the URL

http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/

If you do not have WWW access directly, you can access the Lynx Web
browser by telneting to ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu, login www (needs vt100
terminal) or info.cern.ch. Using a Mosaic browser is a much better
solution, and your system should provide it - Mosaic is available for
Windows, Mac and X-Windows for free from NCSA.

Please send Web addresses for servers of interest to readers of
this list to categories-request@mta.ca so that links can be added (or to
categories@mta.ca for a general announcement.)

The updated routine distribution follows.


*****************************************************************************

This is the routine distribution for the categories mailing list. It is the
file routine.dist in pub/categories at sun1.mta.ca and was last updated on
Sept 15, 1994.

Subscribers should note that the From: field of a categories posting is
categories <cat-dist@mta.ca>
(this is different from some other mailing lists). If you `Reply:' to a
posting it will be redirected to the entire list (unless another intention
is clearly detected by the moderator).

Administrative items (address changes etc.) can be sent to
categories-request@mta.ca
or directly to the moderator. Usually, items of this sort sent to
categories@mta.ca will not be posted.

Access to archives of categories postings and other useful pointers is
available on the World Wide Web; the URL is

http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/

This page may also be reached by pointing to Mount Allison University in
New Brunswick, Canada and then choosing `Academic Information', `Science',
`Math and Computer Science' and `Research Information'.

The archives of postings on categories are held at the ftp site
sun1.mta.ca
in the directory pub/categories. This is a Unix system.

The postings are filed in yearly subdirectories called 90, 91 etc.
Within those subdirectories there are monthly files, and an annual list of
dates and subjects of postings.

In the pub/categories directory there is also a file called ftp.sites with
information about ftp sites holding files of interest to subscribers.
Please send information about WWW/ftp sites with holdings of
interest to categories-request@mta.ca, or to me.

If you need detailed instructions on how to use ftp, ask anyone knowledgable
about the Internet at your site, or write to me.
