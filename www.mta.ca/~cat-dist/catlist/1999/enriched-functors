        It sticks in my mind that somewhere (probably Kelly's book
on enriched category theory) I have seen the composition of
enriched functors expressed in terms of coends.

        Our library's copy of Kelly is out, so I was hoping someone
could help me recover the result and all necessary hypotheses.

        More precisely, I recall that it ran like this (and have
proved this for ordinary categories):

        Associate to an enriched functor F:A \rightarrow B
the functor Hom(F(-),-):A^{op} \times B \rightarrow V

        The composition of F and G is then given by

        \integral^c Hom(F(-),c) \otimes Hom(G(c),-) \cong Hom(G(F(-)),-).

        I am particularly interested in an analogous result for
C-linear categories, and categories enriched in the category of
C-linear categories, as this could have applications to topological
and conformal field theories.

Best Thoughts to all,
David Yetter

David Yetter, in his query, seems to be making heavy weather of the compositionof enriched functors. The composite of F:A --> B and G:B --> C is given on
objects by GFa, while its "effect on maps" is the composite of the effects of Fand of G as in  A(a,a') ------> B(Fa,Fa') -----> C(GFa,GFa'). That is all.

 There is further a composition of profunctors (also called bimodules, or just
modules), given by an evident co-end formula. Now every functor F determines a
profunctor F*, where F*(a,b) is B(Fa,b); and the calculation David refers to
(which is a simple application of the Yoneda isomorphism) is just the verification
that (GF)* is canonically isomorphic to (G*)(F*). Of course this holds, in
particular, for C-linear categories.

 New-Year greetings to all - Max Kelly.

This follows from the enriched Yoneda Lemma. The setting is as follows.
It is tensor product of (bi)modules which is given by the coend formula.
Modules (= profunctors = distributors) between V-categories are the arrows
for a bicategory Mod(V) with this tensor product as composition. Each
V-functor  F  becomes a module in two ways: F_* and F^*. The latter
involves the Hom(F(a),c) as required by David. Each process gives a
locally fully faithful embedding of V-Cat in V-Mod (Yoneda's Lemma)
with appropriate variances. Moreover,  F^*  is right adjoint to F_* in
the bicategory Mod(V).

A good reference is Lawvere's paper "Metric spaces, generalised logic,
and closed categories" Rend. Sem. Mat. Fis. Milano 43 (1974) 135-166.

Best wishes for the New Year,
Ross

Referring to recent contibutions by Yetter and Kelly.

As remarked by Kelly, the construction is straightforward. A paper
strongly recommended to be read in this context is Lawvere's 'Generalized
Metric Spaces ...". The material about composition of profunctors +
construction of "free algebras" are to be found in my contribution "Basic
category theory", chpt. 6, in the Handbook of Logic in Computer Science
(Abramsky, Gabbay, Maibaum, eds.).
