Does somebody know whether for a complete Heyting algebra (cHa) A
such that the specialization order on points is discrete it
automatically holds whether for ALL cHa's  B  the frame morphisms
from  A  to  B  are ordered discretely by the spezialization order.
I know that there are cases (different from complete Boolean
algebras) where it holds but does it hold in general ?

It's not true.

I expect there are already lots of counterexamples amongst non-trivial
pointless locales, but here's something more straightforward.

Let D be a non-trivial locale with no global points (global point = locale
map from 1 to D) and let D' be its lift (or localification), which has a
new bottom point adjoined - by adjoining a new top to its frame. D' has
only one global point (the new bottom) and so the specialization order on
global points is discrete. However, we have two generalized points of D' at
stage D' itself (locale maps from D' to D'), namely the generic point id:
D' -> D' and the bottom _|_: D' -> 1 -> D', and they are distinct with _|_
<= id.
