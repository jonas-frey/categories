Do (finite) colimits exist in categories of diagrams?

Here are the definitions of the terms used above.

A diagram of shape S in a category C is a functor D: S -> C.

A covariant diagram morphism from D1: S1 -> C to D2: S2 -> C is a pair
<sm, mu> consisting a shape morphism (functor) sm: S1 -> S2 and a
natural transformation mu: D1 -> D2 o sm.

A contravariant diagram morphism is similar except that the direction
of the natural transformation is opposite.

We thus get two categories of diagrams in C (of all shapes).
Mac Lane calls these "super comma categories" (p.111).

Now, the question reads: given that (finite) colimits exist in C, do
(finite) colimits exist in the two categories of diagrams in C?

I haven't been able to come up with a construction or a proof that
colimits don't exist. I appreciate any help you can provide on this
matter. Also, I would like to know if there are related results, e.g.,
with limits.

In my thesis, Dalhousie 1976, I used a (2-)category of diagrams of
the kind that you describe, with C=set. The 2-functor cat--->CAT
which sends S to set^(S^op) gives rise to a fibration, say P:D_--->cat,
and the objects of D_ are evidently diagrams in set of variable shape.
If you regard such an object, D:S^op--->set, as a discrete fibration,
say D'--->S, then it is straightforward to describe a 2-fully faithful
2-functor, I:D_--->cat^2 . Now codomain:cat^2--->cat is itself a
fibration over cat and the inclusion I is a 2-functor over cat.
I has a left adjoint, L, that preserves finite products, from which it
follows that D_ is complete, cocomplete and cartesian closed, as a
2-category. By examining the nature of these constructions for my
D_ you should be able to find what you need of a general C to answer
your question.

Well, to continue somewhat, P above clearly preserves limits but it
also preserves colimits because the adjunction L-|I is an adjunction
over cat. This should help to get started on the general problem. In
fact, P preserves exponentiation too.

(Pseudo-)category objects in D_ are interesting. Necessarily, they
give rise to pseudo-category objects in cat. If, for example, V is a
monoidal category then P-over the "category object" VxV--->V<---1 in
cat are precisely the set^(V^op)-categories, where the monoidal
structure of set^(V^op) is Brian Day's (universal) convolution
structure. But there are many other "category objects" in cat that
can be constructed from V and its monoidal data. Assembling these
and looking at their inverse image in D_ allows one to construct a
variant of the Pare-Schumacher theory of indexed categories that
is useful when a given monoidal structure on the base for indexing
is needed for multiply indexed families.
