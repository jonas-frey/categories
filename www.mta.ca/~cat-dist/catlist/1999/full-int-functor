I am searching for a pointer to the definition of full interal functor
F:C->D between internal categories C,D of some category with pullbacks. My
guess is to build the ``subset of arrows D which are image of arrows of C$''
by pulling back F_0 along d_0 and d_1, and intersecting the results (F_0 is
the ``object part'' of F and d_0,d_1 are the domain and codomain morphisms).
F_1 (the ``arrow part'' of F) factors naturally through that intersection,
and if the factor is an epi, I would say F_1 is full.
