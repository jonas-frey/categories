Let C be a category and I and I' graphs (or categories if
you prefer).  Define a morphism of diagrams
psi:(delta:I-->C)-->(delta':I'-->C) to be a graph morphism (or
functor if you prefer) psi:I-->I' together with a natural
transformation alpha:delta' o psi-->delta.  This definition
turns Lim into a contravariant functor from the category of
diagrams to C (when C is complete, anyway).
 
I believe this construction has been familiar since the early
days of category theory, but I don't know a reference and would
be glad to learn of any.
 
By the way, Barr in SLN 236 (page 52) defines an entirely
different notion of morphism of diagrams which Tholen and Tozzi
develop extensively in "Completions of Categories and Initial
Completions", Cahiers 1989, pages 127-156.  This makes Lim a
covariant functor.

The dual construction (i.e. for colimits) appears in
        Rene Guitart, ``Remarques sur les machines et les
        structures'', Cahiers XV-2 (1974);
and its sequel
        Rene Guitart and Luc Van den Bril, ``Decompositions
        et lax-completions'', Cahiers XVIII-4 (1977);
where further references are also given.

I am writing at the university, with my files at home; but my
memory is that the construction was introduced by Eilenberg
and Mac Lane in 1945, in a paper called something like "On a
general theory of natural equivalences".
