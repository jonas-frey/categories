Can someone give me a reference for the fact that if the hom functor on a
category factors through commutative monoids then finite products are sums
and vice versa.  Also conversely.

Mac Lane (Categories for the Working Mathematician) does one direction
in Theorem 2 on page 190. (He assumes enrichment over abelian groups
rather than commutative monoids, but a glance at the proof shows that
the additive inverses are not used.) The converse is stated as Exercise
4 on page 194.

Re: Mike Barr's question concerning two equivalent definitions
    of a class of categories

    Since the term 'additive' had already been established to refer
to the special case where the homs are abelian groups, I called 
these 'linear categories' in my paper

    Categories of Space and of Quantity
    in The Space of Mathematics, Philosophical, Epistemological
    and Historical Explorations, de Gruyter, Berlin (1992) pp 14-30

because 'linear' is a term well known to engineers, statisticians and
others, and because these categories form the natural environment for
applications of Linear Algebra.  Of course, the entries in the matrices
are in general maps, not necessarily scalars, although scalars for which
the addition is idempotent are an important special case. (Here by the 
scalars of such a category I mean the elements of the rig which is its
center.) 
	In that paper I referred to what I believe is the first reference
to this theory, namely Saunders Mac Lane's 1950 paper

     Duality for Groups, Bull AMS vol 56, pp 485-516, (1950)

expounding work he did in the late 40's.

I have checked Mac Lane's 1950 paper and I cannot find any such result.
The converse, that a category in which finite sums are equivalent to
products then the category takes homs in commutative monoids is sort of
there, but the one I asked is not, or at least I didn't find it.  However,
CWM is a likely source and I will check that out.  I just need some
reference in any case.

Dear Mike and everbody
The converse result , as stated by Mac Lane, was what needed to be said in
1950, especially since it began to bring out that category theory has
content. What it's converse to, namely that when maps can be added then
the cartesian product has the mapping property now called coproduct, had
already been folklore for years... or if it hadn't been, how else to
explain the widespread terminological ambiguity concerning "direct sums"?
Perhaps a much older reference needs to be adduced.
Thanks for bringing this up.
Best regards
Bill

The result that finite products coincide with finite coproducts in 
categories enriched commutative monoids can be found in Herrlich`s 
and Strecker`s book under 40.8 (p.308 in the 2nd edition). The 
converse is given there under 4.12 (p.310). They use the term 
"semi-additive category", which I am also used to. Though I agree 
with Bill Lawvere that prefixes like "semi" should be omitted if 
possible, I am not convinced by his suggestion "linear categeory" 
because for me subtraction seems essential fo linear algebra. Maybe 
somebody invents a better term.
