Say that an object X in a category is irreducible iff Hom(X,-) preserves
pushouts. Probably this (or a similar) notion is classical. Am I right ?

Concerning Pierre Ageron's proposed definition of "irreducible" :
Since such terms as "connected"," local", etc should always exclude the
empty case, "connected" in particular is usually defined to mean
preserving all coproducts (including the empty one) . Preserving
moreover pushouts would then amount to "connected and projective",
which in a presheaf category  catches only the Cauchy completion of
the representables. Usually "irreducible" is understood as something
broader than that; for example among finite presheaves on a finite
category, there are an infinite number of connected objects iff the
finite category is not a groupoid. Indeed in G-sets for G a group,
each orbit is connected, but the only orbit which is projective is
the biggest one.

 As William Lawvere pointed out courteously, my tentative definition of
"irreducible" was stupid. So let me ask: is there a standard categorical
treatment of irreducibility (or, dually, of primality), or is it an
essentially order-theoretic concept?
