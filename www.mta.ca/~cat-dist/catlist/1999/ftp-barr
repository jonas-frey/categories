Some of you have been trying unsuccessfully to get files from my ftp
directory, which mysteriously disappeared.  It is now restored.  The
address is ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr.

Subject: categories: My ftp site

I have finally reorganized my ftp site.  It is at
ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr.  There is an Index (The "I" is capitalized so
it is listed first) and it gives the full title and the name of the file.  
All files are given as zipped dvi and zipped ps files.  I will endeavor to
maintain this in this fashion.  In fact, I have attached the Index.

Michael

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Index  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


This is an index of the files.	With the exception of the corrections
and updates to ctcs and ttt, and the electronic parts of ctcs, these
files are available as dvi or ps files with the names xxxxxxdv.zip and
xxxxxxps.zip.  The possible xxxxxx appear below with full names and
bibliographic references, if relevant.
