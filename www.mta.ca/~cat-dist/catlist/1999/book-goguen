From: Joseph Goguen <goguen@cs.ucsd.edu>

The book described below does not explicitly use category theory, but almost
everything in it was inspired in one way or another by category theory, and
so some members of this community may be interested in it.  I want to express
my thanks to all of you for the wonderful work you are doing, which has
contributed so much to my own personal pleasure and professional life.

With warm regards to all,

Joseph

MIT Press has just published an "executable" book for a standard computer
science course, the semantics of imperative programs.  In our experience,
being able to execute the semantics and the proofs greatly helps the students'
intuitions and motivation.  Some details from the publisher are given below.

******************************************************************************
ALGEBRAIC SEMANTICS OF IMPERATIVE PROGRAMS
  Joseph A. Goguen and Grant Malcolm
  MIT Press, July 1996

This  book is a   novel   self-contained "executable" introduction to   formal
reasoning about   imperative    programs.  Its  primary   goal   is to improve
programming  ability by improving intuition about  what programs  mean and how
they  run.  The semantics of  imperative  programs is  specified in a  formal,
implemented  notation, the language OBJ;  this makes the semantics both highly
rigorous and simple, and also provides support for the mechanical verification
of program properties.

OBJ  was designed for algebraic  semantics; its declarations introduce symbols
for  sorts and functions, its statements  are equations,  and its computations
are equational  proofs.  Thus, an OBJ  "program" is an equational  theory, and
every OBJ computation proves  some  theorem about such  a theory.   This means
that an OBJ program used for defining the semantics of a program already has a
precise mathematical meaning.   Moreover, standard  techniques for mechanizing
equational reasoning can be used for verifying axioms that describe the effect
of imperative programs on abstract machines.  These axioms can then be used in
mechanical proofs of properties of programs.

The book    is intended for    advanced  undergraduate or  beginning  graduate
students, and  contains many examples and   exercises in program verification,
all of which can  be  done in OBJ.    The material has been  extensively field
tested at Oxford University.
