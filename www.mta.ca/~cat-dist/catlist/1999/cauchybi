Subject: Cauchy-completion of bicategory?

Hello,

Has the notion of Cauchy-completion of a bicategory been considered?
It looks to me that instead of looking at arbitrary idempotent 1-cells
f together with an isomorphism \alpha : ff ---> f one has to look at
those pairs <f,\alpha> where \alpha is associative.  Without this
requirement I seem to run into coherence problems.

Any pointers to the literature would be welcome.  Thank you!
