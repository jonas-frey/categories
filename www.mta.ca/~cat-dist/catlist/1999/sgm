                    State Graph Manipulators (SGM) 
                     New Version 1.1 Released!!!

              --------------------------------------------

  State Graph Manipulators (SGM) is a high-level state-graph manipulation 
  tool for verification non-experts as well as experts. The tool has
  undergone further refining and testing. A much more stable version (v1.1)
  is now released for downloading. This version provides both a batch
  and an interactive user interface. The next version (v1.2) scheduled
  to be released around January 31, 1999 will have a flexible easy-to-use
  graphical user interface (GUI).

                     Changes in v1.1 from v1.0

(1) Memory usage drastically reduced to 1/8th of that originally 
    required in SGM v1.0. Memory leaks removed using Purify, a 
    commercial program debugging tool from Rational Software.
(2) SGM input language syntax modified to accomodate non-symmetrical
    system descriptions. Non-symmetrical systems can now be described!
(3) A new manipulator (state-graph reduction technique) implemented:
    BIT (Bypass Internal-Transition).
(4) Totally 5 application examples included with v1.1 distribution.
    (a) Fischer's Mutual Exclusion Protocol,
    (b) CSMA/CD Protocol,
    (c) Token Ring Network,
    (d) PATHO OS Priority-Based Task Execution, and
    (e) Bus Arbiter.
(5) User manual updated to version 1.1.
(6) Programming bugs/errors fixed.
(7) Interactive user interface improved.
(8) A graphical user interface has been developed and is being testing
    currently, it will be released in the next version SGM v1.2
    around January 31, 1999.

                    State Graph Manipulators (SGM) 
               New GUI Version 1.2 Released (Solaris OS)!!!
            New Interactive Version 1.1 Released (Linux OS)!!!

  State Graph Manipulators (SGM) is a high-level state-graph manipulation 
  tool for verification non-experts as well as experts. After the release
  of SGM v1.1 which was a more stable version, we are now releasing SGM v1.2
  which has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows more logical
  and flexible manipulation of state-graphs. SGM v1.2 with GUI 
  is now ready for downloading. This version provides both three interfaces:
  batch, interactive, and graphical user interface.

                            "Important NOTE"
  Those who downloaded SGM v1.1 recently are strongly advised to download
  SGM v1.2 which provides not only a GUI, but also removes some program bugs.

                     Changes in v1.2 from v1.1

(1) A Graphical User Interface (GUI) provided for a more user-friendly
    verification environment as well as for demonstrating how state-graphs
    can be reduced by different manipulators (reduction techniques).
    The SGM GUI provides not only all the functionalities that were present 
    in the interactive/batch modes, but also some new facilities like
    graph viewing, renaming, printing, saving, and input file editing, etc.
    On-line help is provided in the GUI.
(2) Memory usage further reduced to 1/10th of that originally 
    required in SGM v1.0 and 4/5th of that required in SGM v1.1. 
    Memory leaks removed using Purify, a commercial program debugging 
    tool from Rational Software.
(3) All 5 application examples that were included with v1.1 distribution,
    can now be directly loaded into the GUI by just some clicks of a mouse
    button.
    (a) Fischer's Mutual Exclusion Protocol,
    (b) CSMA/CD Protocol,
    (c) Token Ring Network,
    (d) PATHO OS Priority-Based Task Execution, and
    (e) Bus Arbiter.
(4) User manual updated to version 1.2.
(5) Further programming bugs/errors fixed.
