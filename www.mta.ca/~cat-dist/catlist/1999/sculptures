we are preparing as part of our efforts on the Popularisation of
Mathematics. Its aim is to show the mathematical and scientific aspects of a
selection of John Robinson's Symbolic Sculptures. Two of his sculptures,
Genesis and Creation, will be unveiled at the Isaac Newton Institute,
Cambridge,  on October 4, as part of the celebrations on the retirement of
Sir Michael Atiyah andSir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer. (Another sculpture,
Intuition, was unveiled in February.)

A common ground of art and science is here intended to be that of form and
structure. So there is an implicit link with any
scientific or mathematical study of form and structure.

Comments and relevant links would be welcomed.
