Subject: correspondence between Kelly and Barr


[note from moderator:
Max queried whether the following ought to be posted. Since the exchange
provides useful information on granting practice in two countries, it
seems appropriate though off the direct topic oflist. Any ensuing
discussion should perhaps be brief, and limited to factual contributions.

Regards to all, Bob]

Subject: an old letter from you to the bulletin board

Dear Michael,

I've been cleaning up some old email files from accounts in various
countries, some of which I kept because I wanted to follow them up,
whereupon they got swamped under piles of more urgent work.

One was a letter of yours of 4 Apr 95 - not to the Bulletin Board, I
now see, but to TAC. In it you speak of

(a) Category meetings, where you say that nothing is refereed, with
    time given to all who want to talk;
(b) Conference proceedings, which (you say) are not seriously
    refereed in our discipline, Categories '91 being an example,
    and granting bodies giving little credit for papers therein.

I want to say that, if what you say is true of Canada or any other
country, it is a great pity. Here, I have fought to have REFEREED
conference proceedings treated equally with papers in refereed
journals - and they are so both by this university and by the
Australian Research Council. In fact the latter doesn't really
count publications at all, but - so long as one DOES continue to
publish reasonably - relies overwhelmingly on peer opinion.

Moreover, I have been on the scientific committee of various
conferences, such as Como and Tours; and we CERTAINLY knocked back
requests to speak. I have also been a referee for many conference
proceedings, and have been ASKED to apply journal standards, and
have rejected papers - in particular for Durham and Como and one
of the Louvain ones.

The point is that I consider Conference Proceedings to be a Good
Thing, of great value to our discipline. Accordingly I strongly
deprecate foolish decisions about their value by grants committees,
which I believe we can and should oppose - which presupposes, of
course, that we henceforth DO take them seriously and apply
appropriately stringent criteria as we do for journals.

I should be happy to hear what you think now that 18 months have
passed - and should also be happy to agree if you thought it best
to send this correspondence to the Bulletin Board (except that I
haven't time to write at great length myself, since there is much
to do before I leave for Europe in early November).

With best wishes - Max.

All I can do is reiterate what my actual experience was when I was
a member of a granting agency (1993-1995, incl., that is for three
years).  There was one case I recall especially.  A woman who had
a substantial pub record in CS conference proceedings.  Now in CS,
conference proceedings really are refereed, relatively carefully.
(I refrain from trying to compare the depth of even a poor math paper
with the typical CS paper as that is irrelevant to this discussion.)
She explained that in CS conference proceedings were a normal publication
method, absent the large number of journals that we, for example, have
to choose from.  No go, the committee simply would not buy it and she
did not get a grant.

Moreover, despite what you say, I know that conference proceedings
are just not carefully refereed, even when they are refereed.  Perhaps
there are exceptions to this, but I am talking about the ones I have
been involved in.  And most meetings make no attempt to screen speakers
beforehand (which is a separate question) the way CS meetings nornally
do.  I just got an announcement for a meeting at CMU in March.  The deadline
for abstracts (limited to 12 pages!) is in December, I think, and they
will let you know in Feb.  This is totally different from the way we
do things.  Not necessarily better (or worse) but different.  I like
the way we do it, don't get me wrong, but it makes it hard to argue
that conference proceedings are in the same class.

You may post this or make any other use you wish.

Regards, Michael

Dear Michael,

many thanks for your reply. There is little more that can be said just now -
even if I had the time to philosophize about it; but the matter is a serious
one, and I shall send my letter and yours to Bob Rosebrugh, so that he may
decide whether it is worth while putting them on the Bulletin Board.

Best wishes - Max.
