I'm looking for some pointer to literature where I can find the
following (or a similar) Theorem:

Let $(T,\eta,\mu)$ be a monad. Assume we have an algebraic structure
such that every free algebra for that monad carries one of those
algebraic structures and such that all morphisms of the form $Tf$
and all $\mu_C$ preserve it. Then all Eilenberg-Moore algebras carry
such a structure and all morphisms between them preserve it.

Thanks

I don't know of an explicit reference, but things of this sort are
certainly familiar.  Look, for example, at the proof in TTT that
toposes are cartesian closed.  For that matter, the proof that a
slice of a topos is a topos uses the same idea.

   I don't know where to look for such a theorem but would be more optimistic
if I knew what 'carries' means. Harvey Friedman published something of this
tendency about 1977, I think with semantic hypothesis and syntactic
conclusion.  John Isbell

Manes' book "Algebraic Theories" contains many propositions and
exercises of this kind, relating monadic and equational presentations
of algebraic theories. I think something of this kind should be there.

PS On a second thought, the matter of monadic vs. equational
presentation just complicates things here. If we begin by presenting
this algebraic structure, carried by all free T-algebras, as another
monad, say (S,\eta,\mu), the proof boils down to two diagrams.

The assumption that each free T-algebra is an S-algebra means that
there is a natural transformation s:ST->T: its components are the
given S-algebras on TX; the assumption that each Tf preserves the
structure is just the naturality of s.

On the other hand, the assumption that \mu of T preserves it means
that \mu s = s S\mu. Using this and the naturalities, one directly
checks that if a:TX->X is a T-algebra, then
        SX --S\eta--> STX --s--> TX --a--> X
must be an S-algebra --- clearly preserved by T-morphisms.

All the best,

  Re:  Your query yesterday on cat-dist

The question you asked was solved in my 1967 thesis and appears as
Exercise 9 on page 217 of my book on Algebraic Theories, Springer-Verlag
GTM 28, 1976 where the reference to the thesis is also given.

In effect, if T is your monad and C is the category of algebraic
structures, you give yourself a functor  J : F ---> C  where F is the
full subcategory of free T-algebras.  This is because a typical
homomorphism between free T-algebras has the form of a composition Tf
followed by a mu.  Your question then amounts to asking for a canonical
extension of J to the category of all T-algebras.  This construction,
based on contractible coequalizers, is given in the references cited in
the first paragraph.

The best answer was that of Ernie Manes. What is at stake is one very
simple observation: if A is the category of algebras for a monad (perhaps
in the context of enriched category theory) and F is the full subcategory
given by the free algebras, then F is dense in A, and moreover this density
may be "presented" by coequalizers. For the meaning of "density presentation",
a notion due to Brian Day, see p.172 of my book "Basic Concepts of Enriched
Category Theory", CUP 1982. Here it means that every algebra is a coequalizer
of a pair of maps between free algebras, IN SUCH A WAY THAT this colimit is
preserved by the representables A(f,-) where f is a free algebra; and this is
very easy to see. Now Thm 5.30 of my book gives a very simple proof that the
left Kan extension along J: F --> A of any functor T: F --> B exists, provided
only that B has coequalizers. The observation of Dusko Pavlovic, that an
elegant argument is to hand when B too is monadic, gives too SPECIAL a result.
The others that have answered don't seem to have pointed out that the
"canonical" extension of T they refer to IS indeed the left Kan extension.
