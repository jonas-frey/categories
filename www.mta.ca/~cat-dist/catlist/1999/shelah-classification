Subject: categories: Classification theory..


	Hello,

	I am looking for papers which interpret
	the conceptual framework (Stability, 
	Simplicity..) of Shelah's Classification
	theory in purely categorical terminology.

	In spite of a remark (page 58, Accessible
	Categories: Makkai and Pare/ Cont maths 104)

	`one of the chief aims of clasification
	theory as pursued by S.Shelah is to 
	answer a purely categorical inquiry
	about completely elemntary categories.'

	I have not been able to find further
	information about this aspect.

	I will be grateful for any pointers.

				Sincerely,
				P.S.Subramanian,
				Tata Institute.

 I don't know of anything treating this directly, but you may have a look at:

"Accessible categories, saturation and categoricity"

       by J. Rosicky,  J. Symbolic Logic 62 (1997), 891-901.
