Hi,
  I've been looking at some applications of category theory in the area of
computer science, where people have defined a category whose objects are
types and arrows are functions.  I've tried to extended this idea to
functions that return functions, A->(A->B), but can't seem to find the right
way to do it.  Has this been done before or is there an obvious representation
for this?

Scott,
        I believe that you are looking for Cartesian Closed categories.  In such
categories the types (A->B) are also objects and a "natural" curry operation on
arrows exists.  Good references include Gunter's Semantics of Programming
Languages and Lambek and Scott's Introduction to Higher Order Categorical Logic.
Also you may want to peek at Ben Pierce's book on Category Theory for Computer
Scientists.
