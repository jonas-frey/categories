Subject: cocomplete toposes having no small set of generators

One possible very concise definition of GROTHENDIECK topos is as an elementary
topos E  such that

1) E is locally small
2) E has small sums
3) E has a small set of generators

One knows that a lex category  B  satisfies  1) and 2) iff the global sections
functor  Gamma : B -> Set has a lex left adjoint Delta.
For an elemenatry topos E satisfying 1) and 2) the condition
3) is equivalent to the requirement that any object X of E is a SUBQUOTIENT of
a Delta(I).

Now may question is

   WHAT IS THE STATUS of LOCALLY SMALL COCOMPLETE ELEMENTARY TOPOSES

Are there natural examples ??

Locally small cocomplete elementary toposes are sufficient for interpreting
set theory. Can they - maybe -  characterised via this property ?
Do there exist models of set theory giving rise to cocomplete topoi which
don't have a small set of generators ?

The background of my question is that elementary toposes as such don't provide
models of IZF (how should one simulate the Goedel-Bernays-Neumann hierarchy ?).It would be nice iff cocomplete topoi were the precise analogon of IZF !
But maybe that's hoping too much ?

Grateful for any hints,
Thomas Streicher

What about small G-sets, where G is a LARGE group.  This was the classic
example of an equational category that isn't varietal, that is lacks
free algebras.  A classic example, anyway.

Thomas Streicher asks about cocomplete topoi that aren't Grothendieck.
The standard example is as follows: an object is a "base set,"  B,
together with an "operator set,"  C, with an action  a:B x C -> B
such that for every  c:C  it is the case that  \b.abc  is a permutation.
One uses the convention that  abc = b  for all  c  not in  C. (So one
may think of this as a set on which the entire universe acts, the
action "having small support".) Given a second such object  B', C', a',
a map from the first to the second is a function  f:B -> B' such that
f(abc)  = a'(fb)c  all  b:B  and  c:(C union C'). This yields a topos
and the forgetful functor to the cat of sets is logical (which tells
one how to construct power-sets).

If one drops the "\b.abc  is a permutation" condition the resulting
cat is not a topos but satisfies the Giraud definition except for
the generating set.

The Fourman interpretation of IZF arising from a cocomplete topos
(I can't find Fourman's paper in MathSci -- look at my paper in the
Mac Lane Festschrift, JPAA Vol 19, 1980) only refers to its
"well-founded part."  One needs "ur elements," that is, one needs
IZFA, to get out of the well-founded part.

The standard example is to be found in 1.96(10) in Cats and
Allegators.

As for the connection with IZF take a look at the Mac Lane
Festschrift, JPAA Vol 19 (1980), for papers by Fourman and me.
IZF without ur-elements is not enough. One needs IZFA.

For some reason the other day I couldn't find on MathSci Mike's paper
on the connection between cocomplete topoi and Zermelo-Fraenkel. It's
in plain sight:

  AU Fourman, Michael P.
  TI Sheaf models for set theory.
  SO J. Pure Appl. Algebra (Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra) 19
(1980), 91--101.
  DT Journal
  AB ``Set theory'' means Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, with atoms,
formulated in intuitionistic logic. ``Sheaf model'' means an
interpretation in a locally small, complete topos. If A is an object
in such a topos {script}E, the cumulative hierarchy V{sub} alpha (A),
with A as the object of atoms, is defined in the expected way, with
power objects at successor stages and direct limits at limit stages,
and with the membership relation on V{sub} alpha (A) and the embedding
of V{sub} beta (A) in V{sub} alpha (A) for beta < alpha being defined
by induction simultaneously with V{sub} alpha (A). Formulas of set
theory in which all quantifiers are bounded by V{sub} alpha (A)'s have
a well-known interpretation in {script}E, since they are formulas of
the internal logic of {script}E. The completeness and local smallness
of E enable the author to interpret unbounded quantifiers as well. The
truth value of ({all} x) phi (x) is the infimum of the truth values of
the approximations ({all} x{in}V{sub} alpha (A)) phi (x) and
existential quantifiers are handled similarly. The main theorem
asserts that the axioms of set theory, as well as the axioms and rules
of the underlying intuitionistic logic, are correct for this
interpretation; if {script}E is Boolean then classical logic is also
correct. The author gives three sorts of examples; (a) Fraenkel-
Mostowski models, (b) Boolean-valued extensions, and (c) symmetric
extensions. The main novelty here is in (a). If A is a set of atoms, G
a group of permutations of A, {script}F a normal filter of subgroups
of G, and M the associated Fraenkel-Mostowski model, then ordinary
truth in M is the same as the author's interpretation in the
Grothendieck topos {script}E of continuous G- sets, i.e. G-sets each
of whose points has its stabilizer in {script}F. This is true despite
the fact that {script}E is only a part of the (non- Grothendieck)
topos of sets and functions of M. The latter topos, which we also call
M, contains sets on which not G, but only some subgroup in {script}F,
acts. These sets are not objects of {script}E, but they are elements
of such objects (specifically of the V{sub} alpha (A)'s) and so
contribute to the interpretation of set-theoretic formulas.
(Reviewer's remark: M is obtainable from {script}E by making supports
split; it is the direct limit, in the sense of logical morphisms, of
the slice topoi {script}E/(G/H) where H ranges over {script}F. This
sort of construction was used by P. J. Freyd [Bull. Austral. Math.
Soc. 7 (1972) 1 - 76; MR 53#576; corrigenda, ibid. 7 (1972), 467 -
480; MR 54#7571].) In connection with (b), the author mentions the
unpublished result of Higgs that the topos of sets and functions of a
Boolean-valued model V{sup}B is equivalent to the topos of sheaves on
B for the canonical topology, and he indicates that his
interpretation, with A={empty}, coincides with the usual
interpretation in V {sup}B. Finally, he shows that symmetric
extensions can be obtained as the pure part (i.e. A=0) of Boolean
extensions of Fraenkel-Mostowski models. (As far as the reviewer
knows, this approach to symmetric extensions was first used by
P. Vopenka and P. Hajek [Theory of semisets, Academia, Prague, 1972;
MR 56#2824].)
