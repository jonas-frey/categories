Subject: categories: A short question about lax-natural transformations

Hi,

In a lax-natural transformation F->G:A->B the 'lax' naturality condition is
expressed in terms of a natural transformation tau:B(n(a),1);G(a,b)->B(1,n(b));F(a,b)
for 0-cells a,b:A. Is there some good reason why tau is in this direction and not
the opposite?
