Dear All,

I'd like to know whether the following is aloready well known ?

Around 1980 in a lecture course at Louvain-la-Neuve Jean Benabou  
introduced the notion of partial topos. He defined it as a category  
IB with pullbacks such that each slice is an elementary topos and the  
reindexing functors  f*  are logical and have right adjoints  Pi_f .  
One immediately can see that it is enough to claim that each slice is  
an elementary topos : 

slices having products means that one has pullbacks 

and for any  f : J -> I  the reindexing functor  f*  is logical and  
has a right adjoint as it is isomorphic to the functor  

(f : f -> id_I)* : (IB/I) -> (IB/I)/f  

which is the inverse image part of a local homeomorphism.

Nevertheless this definition of partial topos as a category all whose  
slices are toposes has a certain defect - pointed out by Benabou  
himself - namely that ANY groupoid is a partial topos as it has  
pullbacks and any slice is the trivial topos.

Now what is a natural condition ruling out this defect. 

I propose the following condition

(Weakening)  for any  I  the forgetful functor  Sigma_I : IB/I -> IB
             has a right adjoint  I* : IB -> IB/I

I call this weakening as any category with pullbacks is a model of  
extensional type theory not allowing empty contexts (which would be  
interpreted as the (non-existing) terminal object). Nevertheless we  
would like to have weakening by a type which corresponds to the rule

      Gamma |- B    A  a type
    ---------------------------
         A , Gamma  |- B

the categorical semantics of "weakening by A" is applying the right  
adjoint to  Sigma_A : IB/A -> IB.

LEMMA 1  An ARBITRARY category  IB  has weakening iff  IB  has binary  
products.

Proof :  If  Sigma_I -| I*  then  I*X : I*X -> I  is the first  
projection and  the counit eps_X : I*X -> X  is the second  
projection.
                end_of_proof


Now the condition of weakening rules out nontrivial groupoids. 


LEMMA 2  If  IB  is a groupoid satisfying weakening then for any  I   
in  IB  the functor  Sigma_I : IB/I -> IB  has a right adjoint and  
therefore preserves colimits. Now  id_I  considered as an object of   
IB/I  is initial and therefore  I = Sigma_I(id_I)  is initial.
Thus all objects of the groupoid are initial and the groupoid is  
trivial.   

           end_of_proof


This suggests the following new

DEFINITION   A category  IB  is a PARTIAL TOPOS  iff  


             (i)  any slice of  IB  is a topos
             (ii) IB  has weakening, i.e. all binary products.


Immediate consequences of the definition :

LEMMA 3  Let  IB  be a partial topos. The the following hold

(i)  IB  has equalizers

(ii) any finite diagram in  IB  has a colimit  iff  

     it has at least one cocone

(iii)  IB / O  is trivial

(iv)   if  f : A -> B  and  the exponential object  B^A  exists
       then  IB  has a terminal object .


In more elementary terms partial toposes can be characterized as  
follows.

LEMMA 4 


IB  is a partial topos  iff

(i)  IB  has pullbacks and binary products   


(ii)  any  f*  has a right adjoint  Pi_f

(iii)  for any  I  the category  IB/I  has a subobject classifier

       (i.e. there exists an epi  Omega_I : Omega_I -> I
             split by  T_I : I -> Omega_I  such that

             for any  f : A -> I  and  subobject  m : A' >--> A 

             there exists a unique morphism  chi : A -> Omega_I
             with  chi ; Omega_I  = f  and  m = chi*T_I         )

Proof :  (ii) is equivalent to any slice being cartesian closed.
       


EXAMPLES of Partial Toposes

(i) (Benabou 1980)

Let  IE  be an elementary topos and  F  a nonempty downward closed  
subset of  Sub_IE(1). Let  IE_F  be the full subcategory of  IE   
consisting of those subobjects  X  s.t.  support(X)  is in  F .
Then  IE_F  is a partial topos.

Taking  IE = Set^I  and  for  F  the subsets of  I  containing at  
most one element (the downward closure of the atoms in  Sub_IE(1))
then  IE/F  is not closed under finite sums.

(ii)  the category of finite trees is a partial topos  

      (Benabou, private communication)

(iii)  the category of spaces and local homemorphisms 

       is a partial topos
       (cf. mail of Freyd in April '94 on CATEGORIES)

(iv)  the category of small (finite) categories and 

      discrete fibrations is a partial topos

      (the slice over  C  is equivalent 

       to the topos of (finite) presheaves over C)
     

       binary products can be constructed by showing that for any  C
       Sigma_C  has a right adjoint; the construction of the right 

       adjoint is suggested by the Yoneda lemma


Are there other useful examples ?? 

Is this the "correct" definition of "partial topos" ?
