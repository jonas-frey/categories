I want to say something along the lines of "You can define abelian
groups in the internal logic of Set, but you can't define sets in the
internal logic of Ab."

Is this intuition supportable?  Ideally there would be a precise
technical sense in which it is provably the case.

Vaughan says -- correctly I think -- that "you can't define sets in the
internal logic of Ab." I suspect that the proof will have to use the
dualities that reside in Ab. Let  Gr  be the category of all groups,
abelian or not. Then:

    The category of co-groups in  Gr  is equivalent to  Set.

Cf:

    The category of co-groups in  Ab  is equivalent to  Ab.

"Co-group" means, of course, "group in the opposite category". The second
of the two assertions above holds for any additive category: it's easy to
show that each object in any additive category has a unique co-group
(indeed, a unique co-monoid) structure (the co-multiplication is the
diagonal map). I know no citation for the first assertion. To prove it,
one shows that the only groups with co-group structures are free groups
and that the only co-multiplication on  Free(X)  is such that
X -> Free(X) -> Free(X+X)  is the point-wise product of the two functions
of the form  X -> X+X -> Free(X+X).

I don't know, since I don't understand these issues sufficiently
well, but if you can define the free abelian group cotriple, you can
then define the coalgebra category for that cotriple and that is the
category of sets.  In fact, that is a ! operation, in Girard's

last was an observation of Jim Otto's.)

   In the Spring of 1971 at Chicago, Peter Freyd gave some very
interesting lectures in which he showed how to construct a topos
from a symmetric monoidal closed category by considering certain
structured co-commutative co-algebras.  This was done in such a
way that for a group G one could recover the topos of G-sets
(and hence the group itself) from the category of linear
representations.  Since the category of abelian groups has a
unique closed monoidal structure, this should refute Vaughan
Pratt's conjecture.  It should have even many more applications
than that, which is why I have long urged Peter to write it up.

Peter Freyd succinctly shows you can't with

        The category of co-groups in  Ab  is equivalent to  Ab.

Interesting that Peter used duality to prove it, since my reason for
strongly believing it was also duality-based.  The general principle I
used for my reasoning was that the only categories "definable" in the
internal logic of a self-dual category are full subcategories of it.
FinAb is self-dual, but FinSet does not fully embed in FinAb.

If only I knew what "definable" meant this would be a proof.

I came to appreciate this principle while investigating Chu(Set,K).
All notions of "definable" I understand (e.g. first order definable)
are subsumed by this principle.  However that's not sufficient reason
to call it a theorem, since someone may have a method of definition I
don't know about that violates it.  For example I have not yet figured
out whether the method of sketches violates it, though I can't imagine
how it could.

        In fact, that is a ! operation, in Girard's
        sense, on the fragment of linear logic that Ab satisfies.  (This
        last was an observation of Jim Otto's.)

Is Jim's statement even well-defined?  ! is a functor projecting LL
onto a cartesian closed full subcategory of itself.  For the above to
make sense you would need a full embedding of the coalgebra category,
namely Set, back into Ab.  But unless I'm dreadfully confused (which I
often am) there isn't such.  What could a set reasonably be other than
the free abelian group on it?  But when you're inside Ab, Ab(G,H) = H
for H a fag, so that's not it.  Similar deal with Rel or CSLat.

I was dreadfully confused about this in 1991 when I first got involved
with duality via CSLat and their sibling Event spaces.  I wish someone
had pointed out to me that my ! *didn't* produce a cartesian closed
category as I was claiming.  Instead I had a long period of waiting for
my vision problems to clear up.

Adding ! to LL stretches LL out a lot, much wider than Ab with respect
to the Stone gamut (the Set<->Set\op axis).  Enough in fact to make it
look rather like Chu(Set,K) for indefinite K, less such amenities as
induction and such obscurities as 1 par 1 |- 1 (noticed by Lafont and
Streicher---with its contrapositive _|_ |- _|_ @ _|_, the two objects
1 par 1 and _|_ become sort of the "two halves" of a single coalgebra
in Chu(Set,K)).  You just have to take the bad with the good when you
have a nice model like Chu(Set,K).

I've incorporated my proof that Set is a bicomplete equational topos
(meaning one with all natural isos identities) into my LL'96 paper,
"Linear Logic complements Classical Logic," sent off last night.  In
the light of Peter Johnstone's remarks it seemed prudent to add an
explanatory paragraph as a sort of talisman against the nonmonotonic
logic of antiChoice fundamentalism extolled on Sundays.  This is now
available as ftp://boole.stanford.edu/pub/llcocl.ps.gz, with tex and
dvi counterparts in the usual subdirectories, /pub/TEX and /pub/DVI.
I'll post the abstract here shortly, or look it up yourself in the file
ABSTRACTS in the same directory.  This is paper 45 in that directory,
getting time to compress its scattered ideas down a bit.

Peter Freyd's assertion

is slightly incorrect. A better formulation should use the category
$Set_*$ of pointed sets instead of $Sets$.
As such this is essentially an old result of
Peter Hilton and Beno Eckmann.
They proved that any cogroup in the category of groups is free.

I would like to say that the younger generation is not always
aware that Eckmann and Hilton have fundamental contributions
to category theory. They have provided basic examples
of objects equipped with algebraic structures in categories.
Consequently opening the road to further abstractions,
like the concept of algebraic theory in the sense of Lawvere.

Among other things, Eckmann and Hilton where interested in identifying
all cogroups in the homotopy category $hTop_*$ of pointed topological spaces.
A basic example of such cogroup is the circle $S^1$.
It explains why the functor $\pi_1(-)=[S^1,-]:hTop_*\to Sets$
has a natural group structure. If $G$ is a cogroup
in $hTop_*$ then so is the smash product
$X\smash G$ for any pointed topological space $X$
This is because $X\smash(-)$ preserves coproduct since it
has a right adjoint (here we are supposing that Top is a convenient category
of topological space). In particular, the spheres $S^{n+1}=S^n\wedge S^1$
have a cogroup structure. Any wedge (topologists call the coproduct
the wedge) of cogroups is obviously a cogroup. In
particular, any wedge of spheres of dimension $n\geq 1$
has a co-group structure.
All the known examples of cogroups in $hTop_*$ are obtained
by taking a smash $X\smash S^1$.
It was conjecture by Eckmann and Hilton that all cogroups
in $hTop^*$ are of the form $X\smash S^1$.
They observe that $\pi_1(G)$ is a cogroup in $Groups$
when $G$ is a cogroup in $hTop_*$.
This is because the functor
$\pi_1: hTop_*\to Groups$ preserves coproducts
by Van Kampen theorem.
In support to their conjecture
they proved that
any cogroup in $Groups$ is free.
It follows that all cogroups in $Groups$ are of the form
$\pi_1(X\smash S^1)$ where $X$ is a pointed set.

Subject: Definition of "definable in"

Date: Tue, 19 Mar 1996 19:57:06 -0800
From: Vaughan Pratt <pratt@cs.Stanford.EDU>

After giving more thought to my question about Set vs. Ab I decided
that it was hopeless to try to resolve as a theorem, and that the
only way out was to resolve it with a definition.

Definition.  A category C is *definable in* a closed category D when it
embeds fully (as a category) in every self-dual closed category
embedding D (as a closed category).

This definition settles by fiat the question of whether *finite* sets
can be defined from finite groups, since FinAb is self-dual, as I
mentioned previously.  Extending this to Ab is a matter of checking
that Set does not embed in Ab\op x Ab, which would surprise me
greatly.

If Set actually does embed in Ab, as some have been telling me
privately, this does not contradict my definition, it merely answers my
original question in the other direction.  To convince me that Set
embeds in Ab it will suffice for you to give me representatives of 2
and 3 whose homobjects between them are the representatives of 4, 8, 9,
and 27.

If you have a more productive notion of "definable in", meaning one
that lets you define categories not possible with the above, there is a
possibility that some trace of Set has leaked into your definition.
If, after convincing yourself that all traces of Set have been
eliminated, it is *still* more productive, then this would be a notion
of "definable in" well worth discussing.

        and since Ab x Ab\op has no empty hom-sets, there is no full
        embedding from Set to Ab x Ab\op. Does that answer your question?

Not if I understand you, for two reasons.  First, you said the word
"hom-set" which isn't allowed in Ab---you have to say homgroup (or
homab).  There being no empty group, if Set embeds in Ab then the empty
set must embed as a nonempty group.  Emptiness in the sense definable
via the forgetful functor U:Ab->Set is not a predicate known to be in
Ab.  Emptiness needs to be defined in terms of the Abelian group
representing the empty set.

You have to analyze any proposed embedding by treating both the objects
and the homobjects between them as Abelian groups.

The second problem is my fault.  I noticed yesterday that my definition
(repeated below, near the end) is too weak.  As a simple
counterexample, groups are well known to be definable in Set, but Grp
certainly does not fully embed as a category in the closed self-dual
category Set + Set\op (= Chu(Set,0)), which embeds Set as a closed
category (that is, the embedding respects tensor products, not
necessarily cartesian products).  The objects are just sets and
antisets, clearly nowhere to store Grp.

I was basing my definition on two theorems of mine.

1. Every category of relational structures, and hence every full
subcategory thereof definable by any wacky language you want, far
wilder and less computable than first order logic, fully embeds in
Chu(Set,2^k) where k is the total arity of the structure.

To determine total arity k of a multisorted multirelation structure,
form the disjoint union of all the carriers, add one unary predicate
per carrier as a marker, and then form the "natural join" of all the
relations.  The embedding works for total arities up to any ordinal;
for a proof look near the end of

        http://boole.stanford.edu/gamut.ps.gz


2.  Every small concrete category embeds in Chu(Set,K) for some set K.

Proof: Take K to be the disjoint union of the carriers of the objects,
and proceed as in

        http://boole.stanford.edu/embed.ps.gz

On the strength of these two theorems I speculated that any method of
defining a category that confined its language to that of V would embed
in Chu(V,k) for a suitable object of k.

What does "confine language" mean?  Terrible things!  It might even
entail giving up conventional equality in favor of weighted limits when
V is not cartesian closed, as with Ab.  Some of you might enjoy a world
where equality didn't exist, not in the sense you have to settle for in
Set where you have to convince skeptical students that equality doesn't
exist, but in the more pragmatic sense that no one else in that world
uses it either, because it really doesn't exist!

What I forget to allow for in my definition was the variability of k.
Larger k lets you define more.  k functions as a simple but effective
and pure notion of signature.  Pure in the sense that the 256 colors on
your monitor are the clean signature of pixel depth, purified of the
grubby representational issues implied by talking instead of the 8
pixel planes as though each plane were a real thing.  This
representation is clearly meaningless for people whose computers have 6
pixel planes coding 729 colors in ternary.

I had foolishly thought that the essence of the Chu construction could
be purified to a statement about duality, but had clean forgotten to
allow for the possibility that a definitional method might cunningly
think to use language to express the definition!

Just how little language can be present in a self-dual category
embedding Set can be can be seen from the example above of Chu(Set,0),
a self-dual category consisting *only* of sets and antisets (aka CABA's
if you ignore concreteness issues).  The sets are realized as the
inconsistent Chu spaces (A,0), the antisets as the empty Chu spaces
(0,A), with (0,0) as the one set that is also an antiset.  (Obviously
this doesn't work for what Dusko Pavlovic calls "little Chu," no
repeated rows and columns.) Chu(Set,0) understood skeletally consists
of just the "dynamic integers," thinking of (0,A) as minus (A,0).  The
only subcategories of this sparse category have as their objects some
sets and some antisets.  This does not even embed Set\op x Set =
Chu(Set,1), which also is too small for anything much, e.g. no posets,
which enter at Chu(Set,2).

I see nothing for it for now but to be upfront about putting Chu in the
definition.

Old definition.  A category C is *definable in* a closed category V
when it embeds fully (as a category) in every self-dual closed category
embedding V (as a closed category).

New definition 1.  A category C is *definable in* a closed category V
when it embeds fully in the category Chu(V,k) for some k in ob(V).

This definition steers between the Scylla of arbitrarily large
self-dual categories and the Charibdis of self-dual categories barely
bigger than V.  It is also a tad shorter.

But there is *still* a problem.  In Set it is not hard to define
Chu(Set,*) as a colimit of Chu(Set,K1) < Chu(Set,K2) < ...  For example
the category of hypergraphs described in

        @Article(
DW80,   Author="D{\"o}rfler, W. and Waller, D.A.",
        Title="A category-theoretical approach to hypergraphs",
        Journal="Archives of Mathematics", Volume=34, Number=2,
        Pages="185-192", Year=1980)

does not to my knowledge embed in any Chu(Set,K) for any fixed K.
(This is an open question, I imagine mainly because no one has looked
hard at it.)  But any *small* subcategory of it does, by the general
result above that *every* small concrete category embeds in Chu(Set,K)
for some K.

This too is easily fixed.  There is a *nonclosed* category
Chu(Set,Set).  The definition looks no different from the usual
definition of Chu, except that in all small interactions (no proper
class of participants), all Chu spaces involved are taken to be over
the colimit of all their K's.  The only failure of this category to be
closed is its lack of tensor unit 1 and its dual _|_ (I've switched to
Girard's notation because these days it makes a lot more sense to me).
The rest of linear logic is fine; furthermore the absence of 1 and _|_
removes the odd-ball property 1@1 |- 1 that Lafont and Streicher
noticed.

With that and MIX gone, about all LL should need now is induction, and
Chu(Set,Set) should then be a complete model of LL without
multiplicative units.

If there is any justice, all this should generalize to Chu(V,V) by
arranging to embed the k's of any interaction of V-enriched Chu spaces
in the appropriate colimit of them in V before letting them interact.

This leads to the even shorter:

New definition 2.  A category C is *definable in* a closed category V
when it embeds fully in the category Chu(V,V).

In view of Dusko Pavlovic's paper on the couniversality of Chu, about
the only improvement likely for this definition (barring further bugs,
sigh) is to replace the explicit Chu construction by its abstract
properties.  The effect will be the same either way, though the
definition is presumably not going to get any shorter that way!

One residual question is how to do enriched category theory from
scratch in V.  Max, help!
