Subject: categories: Evolutive systems with memory

Hello!

I'm trying to get information about Ehresmann & Vanbremeersch theory of
"Evolutive systems with memory". This is a theory for modelling complex
evolutive systems using category theory. I've got a couple of papers
(from 1989 to 1992), but I would like to find a synthtic article which
could present the matter more consistently...

Does anybody know if there is such a thing, or at least whom I could
ask?

Thank you for any help,
