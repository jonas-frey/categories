Dear all,

I would like to remind you about the possibility of
receiving the weekly announcements for the Australian
Category Seminar by email. If you are interested,
please send an email to scrans@mpce.mq.edu.au or to
stevel@maths.usyd.edu.au.

These announcements are also available via our Web pages,
http://www-math.mpce.mq.edu.au/~coact/seminar.html and
http://cat.maths.usyd.edu.au/auscat/,
where you can also find more information about the Seminar,
including abstracts from past Seminars.

I would like to know whether there are similar seminars
on category theory, or closely related subjects, being
conducted at other universities, and if so, whether they
have information available by email or on the Web (a search
with the usual search engines was not very satisfactory).
Please send your responses directly to scrans@mpce.mq.edu.au,
rather than to the list; I will, with your permission of
course, make this information publicly available via our
Web page mentioned above.

Sjoerd Crans
