I need to find out what is known about the separated objects of an
elementary (or even Grothendieck) topos. Pointers to the relevant
literature would be immensely appreciated.

Assuming you mean the separated objects for a Lawvere--Tierney local
operator, what is known (and essentially all that is known) is that
they form a quasitopos. This result is due to me (rather to my
surprise): the first proof of it is in my paper "On a topological
topos" in Proc. London Math. Soc. 38 (1979), 237--271. There is a
lot more detail in Oswald Wyler's book "Lecture Notes on Topoi and
Quasitopoi" (World Scientific, 1991). It remains an open problem
(and a very hard one, I think) whether every quasitopos is
representable as the separated objects for some local operator on
a topos.
