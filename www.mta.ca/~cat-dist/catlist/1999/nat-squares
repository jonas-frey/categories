A natural transformation is an indexed family of arrows such that a
certain diagram commutes. One could require a stronger condition,
namely that the said diagram is a pullback. What would such a
transformation be called? I'm sure I've seen this in the literature
before but I cant remember where. Pointers?

This problem arose in the context of finitary monads where 
T(X) is the derived operations over a set X for some signature. 
The naturality square for the unit turns out to be a pullback. 
This then implies that the unit of the monad is a monic - 
presumably this is a result in the literature somewhere. 
Again, pointers?

this phenomenon is now quite well recognised. some call such natural
transformations "cartesian", while others use Robin Cockett's term "shapely".

Natural transformations for which the naturality square is a pullback
are commonly called cartesian: it's not an ideal name for them, but
it's quite well established. For the question of when the unit and
multiplication of a monad on Sets are cartesian, see section 3 of
"Connected limits, familial representability and Artin glueing"
by A. Carboni and P.T. Johnstone (Math. Struct. Comp. Sci. 5 (1995),
441--459).

Subject: categories: Neil Ghani's question

A week or two ago, Neil Ghani asked about natural transformations
between set-valued functors (I think they were set-valued, but anyway
that is what my answer refers to and is probably true for any reasonably
complete codomain category although a different argument would be
required), say a: F ---> G, such that for any arrow f: A ---> B of the
domain category, the square
                      aA
                FA --------> GA
                |            |
                |            |
                |Ff          |Gf
                |            |
                |            |
                v     aB     v
                FB --------> GB
 is a pullback.  At the time, I sent Neil a private reply, but it
bounced for some reason.  (I said that that I thought that this
condition was reasonable only when restricted to monic f and then such
an a is called an elementary embedding.)  Then a couple of people
answered that it was called a cartesian arrow and I didn't try to resend
my answer.  Well, there is a simpler answer.  In that generality, such
an a is called a natural equivalence.  In other words, non-trivial
examples do not exist.

To see this, it is useful to translate it, using Yoneda, into the
following form.  As usual, I will say that of two classes E and M of
arrows in a category, E _|_ M (E is orthogonal to M) if in any diagram
                  e
              A ----> B
              |       |
              |       |
              |       |
              v   m   v
              C ----> D
 with e in E and m in M, there is a unique arrow B ---> C (called a
diagonal fill-in) making both triangles commute.  Let us denote by h^A
the covariant functor represented by A and for f:  A ---> B, denote by
h^f, the induced natural transformation h^B ---> h^A.  Let E be the
class of all h^f.  Then a is cartesian iff E _|_ {a}.

Now suppose a is cartesian.  First I show that a is monic (that is
injective).  If not, there is an object A and two different arrows u, v:
h^A ---> F such that aA(u) = aA(v).  Let E be the equalizer of u and v
and let h^B ---> E be any arrow.  Then the square

                 B        A
                h -----> h
                |        |
                |        |aA(u)=aA(v)
                |        |
                v   a    v
                F -----> G
 has two diagonal fill-ins, u and v.  Here the arrow h^B ---> h^A is the
composite h^B ---> E ---> h^A and the arrow h^B ---> F is the composite
h^B ---> E ---> h^A ---> F, the latter via u or v.  In a similar way, we
can show that a is surjective.  In fact, given u: h^A ---> G, let E be a
pullback of a and u and let h^B ---> E be arbitrary.  Then we have a
commutative square

                B         A
               h  -----> h
               |         |
               |         |u
               |         |
               v    a    v
               F ------> G
 whose diagonal fill-in gives a lifting of u.

It therefore seems appropriate to restrict the question to certain
classes of arrows A ---> B, for example monics.  Here are a couple of
examples.  If g:  C --->> D is a regular (or just strict) epimorphism
between objects of the domain category, then for E the class of h^f for
all monic f, we have E _|_ {h^g}.  Similarly if E is the class of h^f
for all strict monic f and g is any epimorphism, E _|_ {h^g}.

Mike Barr's answer to Neil Ghani's question is very pretty, but
unfortunately wrong. There are many examples of cartesian natural
transformations (e.g. between functors Set --> Set) which are neither
epic nor monic: for example, the natural transformation
(-) x A --> (-) x B induced by an arbitrary map A --> B.

The mistake in Mike's proof occurs when he says

> Let E be the equalizer of u and v
> and let h^B ---> E be any arrow.

The trouble is that E could be the zero functor, so that there may
not be any arrows h^B --> E.

Subject: categories: a fantastic simplification of our subject

I can't make Mike's proof type-check, so let me try the following:
For any set-valued functor, T,  from any category, let  a:O -> T
be the unique transformation from the empty functor. Isn't it 
obviously cartesian? Has Mike shown all set-valued functors are 
empty?

Good heavens.

Subject: Re: categories: Neil Ghani's question

I refer to Michael Barr's comments on Neil Ghani's question on cartesian
natural transformations. These have been much studied, especially in 
computer science conrexts, and Michael admits he had seen the replies of
Peter Johnstone and myself, in which we independently give precise
references to our separate contributions to the study of monads whose
multiplication and unit are cartesian natural transformations; such as
the monad whose algebras are pointed sets, the multiplication for which
is the cartesian natural transformation whose A-component is A+1+1 --> A+1.

Accordingly I thought it odd that Michael, in the face of this, trusted
his proof that they exist only trivially. Of course, as Peter Johnstone
said, Michael's E is usually empty. Ironically, Michael is tha author of
a famous and striking paper on the point of the empty set, which inter
alia points out earlier errors of this kind on the part of others.

Cartesion natural transformations data:F=>L into the list functor have
	been used to represent the data-shape decomposition of many
	data types of the form FX.

	    data_X
	FX --------> LX 
	|  |         |
F! = 	|  |         | L! =
shape	|--          | length
	|            |
	F1 --------> L1 
	   data_1 =
	   arity

Examples include tree types and array types. See, for example

If T(X) = mu_Y. X + P(X,Y) for some polynomial P then the
	cartesian-ness of the unit for the monad follows from one of
	the main theorems of the paper above, which shows that taking
	initial algebras preserves cartesian-ness. Here it is applied
	to the (cartesian) inclusion X -> X + P(X,Y).

Oops!

I thank Peter J. for an extremely gentle explanation.  And yes, Peter F.,
I did once take note of a certain lack of elements in the empty set, but,
believe it or not that was not the real source of my error.  But that was
so unbelievably dumb that I will keep it secret.
