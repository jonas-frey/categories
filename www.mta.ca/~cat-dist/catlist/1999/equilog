At the 64th PSSL at Braunschweig, I gave a talk about cartesian closedness
of exact completions with an intention to cover equilogical spaces in the
sense of Dana Scott (see D.S.Scott, A New category? Domains, Spaces and
Equivalence Relations, preprint 1996). Unfortunately, Peter Johnstone
found a flaw in my argument. I would like to announce the following result
which covers equilogical spaces:
 
Theorem: Let C be an infinitary extensive category. Then its exact
completion ex(C) is cartesian closed iff C is weakly cartesian closed.
Moreover, the embedding C-->ex(C) preserves exponentials.

With J.Adamek, we have proved that the category of topological spaces is
weakly cartesian closed. Hence its exact completion is cartesian closed
(following the result I announced on May 15).
