Subject: "weakened" operads

From: john baez <baez@math.ucr.edu>

In their book "Homotopy invariant structures on topological structures",
Boardman and Vogt construct from any topological operad O a new one WO,
which can be thought of as a "weakened" version of O in which all the
laws of O now hold only up to homotopy in a coherent way.  

Has there been any subsequent work clarifying this construction?  Here
I'm not interested so much in all the *other* approaches to infinite
loop space machines, as in the notion of "weakening" a topological
operad.  For example, Boardman and Vogt point out that their construction
can be used to discuss homotopy colimits, which makes me wonder if the
construction of WO from O could be done slickly using homotopy colimits.
Has anyone discussed this?

Best,
John Baez

perhaps relevant is the recent developments of bar constructions
for operads
cf the special case of going fromt he dg Lie operad to the L_\infty operad
