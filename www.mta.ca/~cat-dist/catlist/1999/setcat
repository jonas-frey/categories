My name is Warren Glick.  Until illness forced
me into a disability retirement, I was a reference
librarian in the Philosophy Division of the
main branch of the DC Public Library.  Currently,
I am working my way through the Schaum's Outline
Book on Set Theory.  I am a beginner and would
enjoy receiving pointers and guidance on the
relationship between set theory and category theory.


On the Web I have read brief summaries on 
the Bourbaki School's view of set theory and
structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics,
as it relates to set theory.  Please e-mail
and/or mail me any information that might 
assist me.

Thanks in advance for your support.

Dear Warren,
   With Schaum's Outline on set theory, I would recommend
the new (new as proper book; it had a long development)
book "Conceptual Mathematics" by F. W. Lawvere and S. H.
Schanuel. They developed the book as a text for a
'mathematics for poets' course.
