I would like to find out what work has been done relating to the question
of "conceptual completeness"  (in the sense of Makkai & Reyes (LNM 611),
with extention by Pitts (ANAL vol 41) ) for fragments of linear logic or
other substructural logics.

Results obtained, references and/or information on who is or has worked on
this problem would be appreciated.

Thanks!

Wendy  MacCaull
