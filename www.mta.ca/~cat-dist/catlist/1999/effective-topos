Dear All,

A question for people who know about the effective topos.
I'm just feeling my way, so be gentle.

In the effective topos (and any other realizability topos I assume,
but I don't know since I haven't got hold of the tripos paper yet),
one can make internal the combinators S and K. I assume that you
define the functional relations:

        G_s(n,n') = {n'} if Sn = n' \emptyset otherwise.

        G_k(n,n') = {n') if Kn = n' \emptyset otherwise.

(In all this S refers to the combinator S not the successor function).

Now here is the bit I'm not sure about, if we stipulate in a category,
that there must be an object N with a unique pair of maps S and K such that:


         for all x,y    K;x;y = x
         for all x,y,z  S;x;y;z = x;z;(y;z)


Further every map from N to N can be factored into S and K, and for
good measure that N is actually the natural number object to avoid
degeneracy. Does this characterize N in the effective topos? and hence
the modest sets?

Regards

Justin Pearson

I'm having trouble interpreting the question posed by Justin
Pearson. If  N  is the natural numbers object then it certainly has a
fixed-point-free self-map, which gives me trouble in figuring out
what's meant by "every map from  N  to  N  can be factored into  S
and  K."

Some people have been confused by my question.
This probally reflects a confusion on my part.
There are two seperat parts.
i)In the effective topos, given the internal defn. of S and
K on N. Can every map form N to N be written as arbitary (fintie) words
over S and K.
I.E. given f:N -> N, can f be writen as some word f=S^a;K^b;S^c;K^d ... for
a,b,c,d, ... > 0?

ii) If (i)  is true, then can we turn it around on its head and use it as
a definition of the natural number object N in Eff? But as Rosolini pointed out
there is a problem, do I mean every PARTIAL map can be factored?


Hope this helps, sorry about the confusion, but as I have said it is all
probally due to me.

Regards
Justin Pearson

With respect to the question from Justin Pearson, my point remains.
Since the 1930's it has been the case that if every function from
A  to  A  can be written as a combination of  S's and  K's then
every function from  A  to  A  has a fixed point. (Note the word
"combination" not just the special case thereof, "word".)
