I'm looking for references on analytical functors and
their power series expansion. 
Thanks for any help.

Dear Luis Soares Barbosa

Presumably you know of Andre Joyal's article in SLNM 1234.

There are close relationships amongst analytic functors,
species and operads. So the topic is a BIG one.
Recent "Notes on the Lie operad"
by Todd Trimble <trimble@math.uchicago.edu> might be a
good starting place for seeing this connection and for
seeing a thoroughly worked example.

Sincerely,
Ross Street

Dear Prof. Barbosa,
                   you can read on analytic functors
and their power series expansion in my paper
"Foncteurs analytiques et especes de structures"
published in the proceedings of a Colloquium on
Enumerative Combinatorics SLN 1234 (1984 or 1985?).

Unfortunatly, the paper is in french.

If you have any questions, I would be glad to help.

Andre Joyal
