Dear Colleagues,

Next year we shall be mounting a (heavily) revised version of our MSc
course, an advert for which follows. Please pass the advert on to
anyone you think might be interested. Please encourage all your best
students to apply to us. And of course, please have a wonderful
Christmas!

all best wishes
Edmund Robinson

PS Perhaps I should also take this opportunity to tell those of you
who haven't heard, that we are proud to announce the appointment of
Peter O'Hearn to a readership in the department. Peter continues a
departmental tradition of people called Peter with interests in
programming languages. He replaces Peter Landin, who has retired from
formal duties.

| Advanced MSc in Logic and Foundations of Programming |
 ------------------------------------------------------

Applications for entry in Autumn 1996 are invited from candidates who
have or expect to obtain a good honours degree in mathematics or a
subject with substantial mathematical content.

This newly designed MSc programme aims to allow mathematically able
students to acquire a thorough grounding in the logical foundations of
computer science and the theory and practice of programming.


 ----------
| Syllabus |
 ----------

Students take four courses:

* Programming

  Programming in imperative, logic and functional languages;
specification and verification applied to imperative programs; the use
of equational specification; program transformation; logical
foundations of Prolog; partial evaluation.


* Deduction

  Formal logical systems; structural proof theory including proof search
constructive logic and its semantics; type theory, lambda calculi and
structural operational semantics.


* Semantics

  Universal algebra; category theory; categorical model theory; classical
denotational semantics; topics in modern denotational semantics.


* Concurrency

  Game theory and its applications in logic and to the theory of processes;
process algebra; equivalences between processes; equational reasoning;
use of process calculus in specification and verification.

All four courses will be taught by active researchers who are experts
in these fields. Courses are taught over the first two semesters, with
the remainder of the year being devoted to the project.

We expect that a small number of EPSRC studentships will be available
for suitably qualified candidates.
