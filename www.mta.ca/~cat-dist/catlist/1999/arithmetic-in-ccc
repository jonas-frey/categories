	Take cartesian closed categories in the sense: having products, and
internal homs. If there is a natural number object you can define addition
NxN-->N with the usual recursion

		0+n = n          sm+n = s(n+m)

But can you prove it is commutative? You can prove 0+n=n+0 because you can
prove both = n. And you can prove each case of commutativity for "standard
natural numbers" in the sense of global elements sss..ss0 gotten from 0 by
(externally) finitely many applications of successor. 

	But even if I also assume equalizers, I do not see how to prove
commutativity for arbitrary global elements, let alone all generalized
elements. I suspect there are counterexamples but I cannot give one.

	I wonder if this is in Lambek and Scott, but my copy is at the office and
I will not be there until Monday so I am writing in to ask.

best, Colin

Subject: categories: Arithmetic query answer


	Todd Wilson answered my query by politely pointing out the obvious--
that the function g:N-->N^N with g(m) = (lambda n)(sn+m) is defined by the
same induction on NxN as the function g':N-->NxN with g'(m) = (lambda
m)(m+sn). Namely, g(0) = successor, and gs = sg. And so the function
h:N-->N^N with h(m) = (lambda n)(m+n) is defined by the same induction as
h'(m)=(lambda n)(n+m), namely h(0)= 1_N and hs=sh.

	I'm afraid I manufactured a difficulty by focussing on Cartesian Closed
categories as "less than toposes" rather than thinking of them in their own
terms--so the "Peano axiom" kind of proof I was looking for is unavailable,
but no problem.

Colin's question is a good one.

Associativity tells us that  \x.1+x  and  \x.x+1  commute and that's
enough -- using the defining universal property of the NNO -- to make
them equal: each is a solution to the equations  f(0) = 1  and
f(s(x)) = s(f(x)).

The most conceptual way I can think of to finish the argument is to
use that fact that the NNO (in a locos) is the free monoid on a single
generator. The opposite-monoid functor is an involution on the
category of monoids, hence the opposite monoid, ONN, of NNO is also
free. (ONN has the same underlying object as NNO, but with the twisted
binary operation.) We need only verify that the unique monoid map
g:NNO -> ONN  is the identity. Whatever it is, it is satisfies the
equations  g(0) = 0  and  g(x+1) = 1+g(x). And that's enough to
force it to be identity.
