Subject: Co-well-poweredness of varieties of algebras

If we are given an algebra A in a variety of algebras, then the set of
onto homomorphisms with domain A is obviously a small set.  Is the same
true of the set of epimorphisms in the variety, with domain A?  I believe
this is what is meant by asking, "Is the variety co-well-powered?"  In any
case, I think the answer must be known, and I think the answer is yes, but
I don't have any reference.  So, could someone help me with this?

William Rowan asks if  equational varieties, when viewed as
categories, are well-co-powered.

Yes. A method of proof appears in my 1964 "Abelian Categories" on
pages 91-93. The context of the method is much more general: it holds
for any category whose objects are defined as the models of a given
set of elementary sentences and whose maps are defined as the
functions that preserve a given set of elementary formulae. Ditto
for well-poweredness.

I believe, also, that that book is the initial appearence of
"co-well-powered".  It should, of course, have been "well-co-powered".

  Co-well-poweredness is long known; I think it was an exercise in Peter
Freyd's book {\it Abelian Categories}. I think I gave a smaller upper bound for
the number of epi-quotients in my La Jolla conference (1965) paper "Epimor-
phisms and dominions". As I recall, my argument obviously extends to infinitary
algebras but Peter's doesn't. That is, infinitary algebras with rank. With no
rank, it was unknown for a couple of years in the mid-sixties whether
co-well-poweredness still holds; but it turned out there is a very natural
counterexample, the variety of frames (dual of locales).

Minor point. John mentions that his argument for algebras "obviously
extends to infinitary algebras but Peter's doesn't."

But it does. I guess it's a matter of what one means by "obviously".

The fact that varieties are co-well-powered follows from much more
general results proved in M.Makkai and R.Pare, Accessible categories:
the foundation of categorical model theory, Cont. Math. 104, AMS 1989
(e.g., any accessible category with pushouts is co-well-powered).
For locally presentable categories, which cover varieties, it is shown
in P.Gabriel and F.Ulmer, Lokal Presentierbare Kategorien, L.N. in Math.
221 (1971). These results are also contained a recent book Locally
Presentable and Accessible Categories, Cambridge Univ. Press 1994
written by J.Adamek and me.
