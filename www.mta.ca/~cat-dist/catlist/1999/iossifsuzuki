Via Stefano Kasangian I've come in the possession of a typed
manuscript entitled "The concept of computational varieties",
written by Michael Iossif and Yoshindo Suzuki.
According to Stefano, this dates back to the (early?) 80's.
The authors develop an abstract idea of "computable function",
using sheaves; and they finally prove that their computable
functions are closed under primitive recursion.
Has anyone heard of these people? At the time of the manuscript
they worked at the Logic Division of the university of Sussex
(presumably England).
I'd be very grateful for a pointer.
