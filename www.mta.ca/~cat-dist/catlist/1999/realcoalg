Subject: categories: Real coalgebra

I've been looking at the Proceedings of the Second Workshop on
Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science (CMCS'99), Electronic Notes in
Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 19, to be found at

  www.elsevier.nl:80/cas/tree/store/tcs/free/noncas/pc/menu.htm

There's a nice paper by Dusko Pavlovic and Vaughan Pratt. It's
entitled On Coalgebra of Real Numbers and it has turned me on. Their
abstract begins:

  We define the continuum up to order isomorphism (and hence
  homeomorphism) as the final coalgebra of the functor  X x omega,
  ordinal product with omega. This makes an attractive analogy with
  the definition of the ordinal omega itself as the initial algebra of
  the functor  1;X, prepend unity, with both definitions made in the
  category of posets.

I thought of using another functor. And damned if it isn't just what
I should have had for my CTCS talk last September at Edinburgh.

In the category of posets with top and bottom consider the binary
functor, X v Y, obtained by starting with the disjoint union  X;Y,
with everything in  X  ordered below  Y,  and then identifying the 
top of  X  with the bottom of  Y.  The functor  X v X  preserves the 
terminator (the one-element poset) hence the terminator is its final
coalgebra. So restrict to the category of posets with _distinct_ top
and bottom. The functor  X v X  again has a final coalgebra: this time
it's the closed interval, I.  (For Dusko and Vaughan's functor it's 
the half-open interval. For yet another functor, one that ought to
have the open interval as its final coalgebra, but doesn't, see PS
below.)

If  X v Y  is described as the subobject of the product  X x Y
consisting of those pairs  <x,y>  such that either  x  is top or  y 
is bottom, then a coalgebra structure for  X v X  can be described as 
a pair of endo-functions  d,u  such that for each  x  either  d(x)
is top or  u(x)  is bottom. On the interval  [a,b]  the 
final-coalgebra structure is understood to be given by 
d(x) = min (b, 2x - a)  and  u(x) = max (a, 2x - b).

In fact, we didn't need to start in the category of posets. It would
have sufficed to work in the category of sets with distinct top and
bottom (see PPS below for a proof). The final coalgebra is still the
closed interval and, yes, the ordering is implicit: it is the most 
inclusive relation preserved by  d  and  u  that avoids placing top 
below bottom. (It can also be obtained by constructing either of the 
two lattice operations on  I  as the unique coalgebra map  I x I --> I
for an appropriately chosen coalgebra structure on  I x I.  A similar 
construction works for the Pavlovic-Pratt coalgebra.)

Indeed, all of the structure of the closed interval is definable from
this coalgebra definition. Go back to the category of posets with 
distinct top and bottom. It is routine to verify that  X v X  commutes
with the opposite-poset functor hence -- using the fact that that 
functor is an equivalence -- its final coalgebra will be invariant
under that functor. That is, there is an isomorphism from  I  to its
opposite.

It takes more work, but not an infinite amount, to construct a 
coalgebra structure on  I x I  so that the induced binary operation 
I x I --> I  is the midpoint operation, the values of which will be
denoted here as  x|y.  It is pretty much characterized by the 
equations: idempotence, x|x = x; commutativity, x|y = y|x; and middle-
two-interchange, (u|v)|(x|y) = (u|x)|(v|y); together with cancelation:
a|x = a|y  =>  x = y.  If one chooses a zero, then one may prove that
there's an ambient abelian group with unique division by  2, such that 
the given midpoint algebra is a subset closed under the operation
x|y = (x + y)/2.  (There must be an existent reference for this.) 

Actually we want that ambient abelian group for  I;  it's none other
than the reals. The order-duality makes its construction easier than 
in the general case. So let's use  1  to denote the top of the final
coalgebra, I, -1  for the bottom, and  0  for their midpoint, -1|1.
Let  h:I -> I  denote the "halving" map that sends  x  to  0|x.  Note
that  h  is an endomorphism with respect to  0, the ordering, the 
duality, the midpoint structure (and not, of course, the top and 
bottom). For a moment enter the category of endomorphisms, and reflect
the object  <I, h>  into the full subcategory of automorphisms. (The 
reflection may be explicitly constructed as the colimit of the diagram
   h     h     h
I --> I --> I -->...)  The result is a poset-with-0-and-duality-and-
midpoint-operation we'll denote as  R.  The midpoint operation 
respects the order and commutes with duality.  0  is self-dual. By
making  h  an automorphism we know that for all  y  there is a unique
x  such that  0|x = y.  On  R  define  a + b  by the equation
0|(a + b) = a|b  and verify  0 + b = b = b + 0  and 
(a + b) + (c + d) = (a + c) + (b + d).  Use the duality to define  -a
and verify  (-a) + a = 0.  Use  h  to define  a/2  and verify 
a/2 + a/2 = a.  All of this makes  R  an abelian group with unique
division by  2.

Viewing  R  as an ordered abelian group it is easy to verify that any
endomorphism is determined by where it sends  1  (inherited from 
I -> R).  That, of course, allows us to define the multiplication.

Those who heard my CTCS talk last September at Edinburgh, "Path 
Integrals, Bayesian Vision, and Is Gaussian Quadrature Really Good?",
(there's an abstract at the same website as above) can appreciate why 
I'm particularly happy. I started by defining ordinary integration of
continuous functions using -- without knowing it -- this coalgebra
structure on  I.  Let  C  be the functor that assigns to a space  X
the set, C(X), of continuous real-valued functions on  X.  The 
"mean-value" function  M:C(I) -> R  can be characterized -- indeed,
evaluated -- from its order-preservation together with what it does to
constant functions and
                                                MxM
         C(I v I) -->  C(I + I) --> C(I) x C(I) ---> R x R
  
        C(F) |                                         | m
             v                                         v         
                                 M
          C(I)  ------------------------------------>  R

where  F:I -> I v I  is the coalgebra structure and  m  is the
midpoint operation. If  C(F)  is inverted then this diagram can be 
read as a fixed-point definition of  M.  (It's the unique fixed-point 
of an operator acting on the set of all those order-preserving maps 
from  C(I)  to  R  that do the right thing on constant functions.)


PS
Just for comparison, consider the category of posets and the functor
that sends  X  to  X;1;X.  The open interval is an invariant object 
for this functor but it is not the final coalgebra. For that we need
-- as we called it in Cats and Alligators -- Wilson space. Actually,
not the space but the linearly ordered set, most easily defined as the
lexicographically ordered subset, W, of sequences with values in  
{-1, 0, 1}  consisting of all those sequences such that for all  n 
a(n) = 0  =>  a(n+1) = 0  (take a finite word on  {-1,1}  and pad it
out to an infinite sequence by tacking on  0s).

PPS
Given a coalgebra structure described by endo-functions  d  and  u  on
X, let  End(X)  be the monoid of endo-functions on  X.  We will need 
to compose in the diagrammatic order: "ud" means "first  u  then  d".
Let  {0,1}*  be the free monoid with generators named  0  and  1  and
Let  M_X:{0,1}* --> End(X)  be the monoid homomorphism such that  
M_X(0) = d  and  M_X(1) = u.  Given  x  in  X  let  L  be the subset of 
{0,1}*  consisting of those words  w  such that  M_X(w)  sends  x  to
top in  X.  The elements of  {0,1}*  may, of course, be  viewed as
finite words on  0  and  1.  By catenating  "0."  on the left of any
such word we obtain a description -- in binary -- of a dyadic rational
in the half-open unit interval  [0,1).  Define  f:X -> I  by sending
each  x  to the supremum in  [0,1]  of the dyadic rationals, r(L),
named by the words in its corresponding  L.  The  L  corresponding to
d(x)  can thus be obtained by taking each word in  L  that starts with
0  and deleting that  0.  The resulting  r(L)  can be described by
first throwing away each dyadic rational bounded below by  1/2  and
then doubling each dyadic rational that remains, that is,doubling each
dyadic rational bounded above by both  f(x)  and  1/2.  The resulting 
supremum is thus  min (1, 2f(x)).  That's what  f(d(x))  is. And it's 
also what d(f(x)) is. Same sort of argument for  u.

A little too easy. The recipe above does work for  f  but the proof 
that it works requires work. Note that the above argument requires --
among other things -- that  r(L)  be a downdeal. (And note that it 
never invoked the facts that  d  and  u  preserve top and bottom nor 
the fact that  d(x)  is top or  u(x)  is bottom for all  x.)  I think 
a  return to Dedekind works best. Besides defining the "lower" set, L, 
define the "upper" set  U  as the subset of  {0,1}*  consisting of 
those words  w  such that  M_X(w)  sends  x  to bottom. We have the
facts:
              w:L  =>  w0:L  and  w1:L            (using 
              w:U  =>  w0:U  and  w1:U              ":"
         w:{0,1}*  =>  w0:L  or   w1:U        for membership)

We may infer, just from  w:L => w0:L  and  w:U => w0:U, that if a
dyadic rational has a name in either  L  or  U  then it does not have
a name in the other. Thus we obtain a disjoint pair of sets of dyadic
rationals  r(L)  and  r(U).  For any pair of dyadic rationals 
x,y:[0,1)  where  x is _not_ in  r(L)  and  x < y,  it is the case 
that  y  is in  r(U):  it suffices to check, for any word  w, that if
w0  can be prolonged to a name of  x, then  w0  is not in  L  forcing
w1  to be in  U  and, hence, any prolongation of  w1  to be in  U.  It 
follows that  r(U)  is an updeal and if there's a dyadic rational in
[0,1)  that is in neither  r(U)  nor  r(L)  then there's only one such
dyadic rational, to wit, the greatest lower bound of  r(U).  It
follows that  r(L)  is a downdeal. The pair  r(L)  and  r(U)  thus
forms a Dedekind cut and we can use it to name the value of  f(x). 
The compatibility with  d  and  u  is a straightforward computation.

For uniqueness, first verify that for every pair  a < b  in  I  
there's a word  w:{0,1}*  such that  M_I(w)  sends  a  to bottom and
b  to top. If  f,f':X -> I  were both coalgebra maps, and  x:X  were
such that  f(x) < f'(x)  let  w  be as described. Note that  M_I(w0) =
M_I(w) = M_I(w1).  But either M_X(w0)  sends  x  to top or  M_X(w1)  
sends  x  to bottom. The first case contradicts that  M_I(w0)  sends
f(x)  to bottom. The second case contradicts that  M_I(w1)  sends
f'(x)  to top.

Apropos of Peter's kind remarks, the journal version of our paper
should be in TCS soon, entitled The continuum as a final coalgebra.
Meanwhile it's on the web as

        http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/continuum.ps.gz

Abstract:
We define the continuum up to order isomorphism, and hence up to
homeomorphism via the order topology, in terms of the final coalgebra
of either the functor NxX, product with the set of natural numbers, or
the functor 1 + NxX.  This makes an attractive analogy with the
definition of N itself as the initial algebra of the functor 1 + X,
disjoint union with a singleton.  We similarly specify Baire space and
Cantor space in terms of these final coalgebras.  We identify two
variants of this approach, a coinductive definition based on final
coalgebraic structure in the category of sets, and a direct definition
as a final coalgebra in the category of posets.  We conclude with some
paradoxical discrepancies between continuity and constructiveness in
this setting.


PF>So restrict to the category of posets with _distinct_ top and bottom.

...which has no final object, making the following all the nicer:

PF>The functor  X v X  again has a final coalgebra:

The bipointed-set version of this seems like *the* right way to generate
the topology of the continuum.  Verry nice.

In other words the continuum plus *two* additional copies of each rational
(as opposed to Cantor space's one additional copy).

Here I should be understood as [-1,1].  Peter's implicit definition
of this coalgebra structure on I x I has the following equivalent
five-equation explicit definition (or seven if you count each of (3)
and (4) as two equations).  My apologies to anyone reading this with a
variable-width font.

                  x + y        y + x
(1)               -----    =   -----
                    2            2

                  0 + 0
(2)               -----    =   0

(3)              2         =     2           or the 2 o's are - and t is 1
                --------       -------    (o = operator, t = terminator)
                    2             2

               xo1   yo1       x + y
               --- + ---       -----o1       where the 3 o's are either
(4)             2     2    =     2             all - or all +
                -------        -------
                   2              2

                x-1   y+1      x + y
                --- + ---      ----- + 0
(5)              2     2   =     2
                 -------       ---------
                    2              2

All these equations clearly hold on I; the question is, what is their
content?  Well, spacing around + and - is significant: without a space the form
x-1        x+1
--- (resp. --- )  denotes a non-middle (nonzero) element of I which when
 2          2
represented as a string over {-1,0,1} has head -1 (resp. 1) and tail x,
                            x + y
while with a space the form ----- denotes a pair (x,y) of I x I.
                              2
Finally, if -1, 0, or 1 (which includes t) are preceded by a space then
they denote the respective infinite constant sequences -1,-1,-1,... or
0,0,0,.. or 1,1,1... (each of which has that constant as its value).
(Once a sequence hits a zero it stays zero.)

The left hand side always has exactly one spaced +, and at the outermost
level, since that's what we're trying to define.  On the right hand
side, each occurrence of a spaced + denotes a corecursive call (so two
corecursive calls in the last equation --- it might seem like a lot of
bother to do a corecursive call merely to add 0, but the real point of
the second call is of course to divide the result of the first call by 2,
which we can do by taking the mean with 0.)

Equation (1) merely ensures that any pair (x,y) will match the left
hand side of one of (2)-(5) one way round or the other.  Equations
(2)-(4) provide instant gratification inasmuch as they allow immediate
production of the first "trit" (ternary digit) of the mean of x and y
given only the first trit of each of them, thereby explicitly defining
the desired coalgebra structure on I x I.  But if you hit equation (5)
you may be in for a long or even infinite wait (consider taking the mean
of -1,1,-1,1,...  (= -2/3) with 1,-1,1,-1,... (= 2/3), which to us is
obviously zero but not so obviously to equation (5)).  So equation (5)
does not give the coalgebra structure at this part of I x I explicitly,
one must regrettably deduce it by corecursion.

Subject: categories: Re: Real coalgebra -- replacing equations by geometry
Date: Fri, 24 Dec 1999 13:59:52 -0800
From: Vaughan Pratt <pratt@cs.stanford.edu>


The continuum is intrinsically geometrical, so it is a shame to specify
Peter's midpoint coalgebra on IxI with a mess of algebraic-looking
equations as per my previous message when it has a relatively short and
transparent geometric specification.  (I must have got this idea from
the paper on higher dimensional automata that I'm just finishing up.)

Incidentally there were two ambiguities in my equations, arising from
respectively equations (1) and (5).  I was going to offer fixes for
these, but one of the degeneracies that made these ambiguities possible
in the first place (that with (5)) does not even arise in the geometric
presentation, while the other, arising with (1), is just as readily
dealt with geometrically as algebraically.

In the following I'll refer to this coalgebra as Fm for Freyd's midpoint
(unrelated to Scott's bottom).  (For listeners who just tuned in to Fm,
its role is to promote the final coalgebra I of Peter's fusion functor
X v X from a linear order, and hence a topological space via the order
topology, to a metric space understood as the real interval [-1,1].
It does this by furnishing IxI with a coalgebra, which determines a
unique coalgebra homomorphism from IxI to I, I being the final coalgebra.
This homomorphism is then taken to be (x+y)/2, while the endpoints of
I are taken to be -1 and 1, thereby uniquely determining a continuous
metric on I qua topological space.)

For both the equational and geometric specifications, here's what the
domain and codomain of Fm look like.


                                                    (1,1)
                IxI                                   ^
                                                     / \
                                                    /   \
                (1,1)                        (1,-1)<  1  >(-1,1)
                 /\                                 \   /
                /  \                Fm               \ /
         (1,-1)<    >(-1,1)   ------------->          0      IxI v IxI
                \  /                                 / \
                 \/                                 /   \
              (-1,-1)                        (1,-1)< -1  >(-1,1)
                                                    \   /
                                                     \ /
                                                      V
                                                   (-1,-1)

So Fm maps pairs of the form (x,-x) to 0 (where the two copies of IxI
are fused) and all other pairs (x,y) to a pair (h,(x',y')) whose head h
specifies which copy of IxI to land in, 1 for upper and -1 for lower, and
(x',y') gives the landing point within that copy.  Here -1 <= x,y,x',y' <= 1, 
-x is defined by changing all the signs on the sequence representing x
and h is unproblematically determined by whether (x,y) is in the upper
or lower half of IxI oriented as shown.  The tricky part is to specify x'
and y' reasonably.

(Although it is convenient to think of x and y as reals in [1,-1], at
this stage they are merely infinite sequences over {-1,0,1} with the
properties that once zero alway zero and infinite runs of -1 or 1 are
only allowed in constant sequences.)

The domain of Fm, namely I x I, can be blown up as


			    (1,1)
			     /\
			    /  \
			 (1,0) (0,1)
			  / \  / \
			 /   \/   \
		  (1,-1)<   (0,0)  >(-1,1)
			 \   /\   /
			  \ /  \ /
			(0,-1)  (0,1)
			    \  /
			     \/
			  (-1,-1)


In my previous mess-age, my five equations implicitly decomposed this
domain into nine regions, namely the midpoint (0,0) (equation (2)), the
four lines leading out of it (equation (3)), the upper and lower diamonds
(equation (4)), and the left and right diamonds (equation (5)).

For the geometric description of Fm, a simpler decomposition suffices,
namely three regions: the upper and lower diamonds as one region, call
it M for Middle, and the interior of each side diamond along with its
outer sides, call them L and R.  (So M is closed and L + R = IxI - M.)


			       (1,1)

	       .            (1,0) (0,1)          .

We now describe Fm as follows.  Its restriction to M is the evident
similarity between M and IxI v IxI.  And its restriction to each of L
and R lands in S, and in each case is the whole of Fm shrunk in half
(the corecursion is essential, not even geometry can eliminate it).

Note that these maps are defined on sequences, i.e. we are not assuming
the metric we set out to construct.

Fm as defined is not commutative, but can be made so by composing its
restriction to L with commutativity of (x+y)/2, viz. reflection of L about
its central vertical axis, thereby symmetrizing Fm.  (This commutativity
ambiguity also arose via equation (1) of my 5-equation approach.)
This symmetrical Fm would appear to be the canonical choice for Freyd's
midpoint coalgebra.  (The apparent competitor obtained by reflecting
R instead of L is slightly more discontinuous, if that's a reasonable
tie breaker.)

This coalgebra is of course not final, nor is it even injective, though
it is surjective, witness subdomain M.  It is also not continuous:
points near (1,0) in L go to points near (1,(0,0)) in IxI v IxI, while
points near (1,0) in M go to points near (1,(1,-1)) in IxI x IxI.
On the other hand points near (1/2,0) in both M and L.M (the M of L)
go to points near (1/2,0) in IxI v IxI, which has no counterpart in the
above-mentioned competitor.

Question.  Is there a corecursively defined Freyd midpoint coalgebra
that is continuous?

(x,y) |--> ((x+y)/2,(x+y)/2) (projection onto the center axis) is a
continuous midpoint coalgebra, but that assumes the metric before we've
defined it.  What corecursion would define this?

It could well be that Vaughan and I are defining the midpoint structure
in the same way. Here's how I described it (using the conventions from
my last posting).

Let  F:I --> I v I  be a final coalgebra. We will denote the top of  I
as  T  and the bottom as  B.  Construct the "halving" map,  h:I --> I,
(on  [-1,1]  it will send  x  to  x/2)  as:  

                   T v F v B             F'v F'        F'
    I --> 1 v I v 1 ------> I v I v I v I ---> I v I  --> I

where  F' denotes the inverse of  F, and, by a little overloading, T
and  B  denote the maps constantly equal to  T  and  B.  The leftmost
map records the fact that the terminator is a unit for the 
ordered-wedge functor.

Let  g  be the endo-function on  I x I  defined recursively by:

    g<x,y> = if  dx = T  and  dy = T  then      <x,y>    else
             if  dx = T  and  uy = B  then  h(g(dx,uy>)  else
             if  ux = B  and  dy = T  then  h(g<ux,dy>)  else
             if  ux = B  and  uy = B  then      <x,y>.

The values of  g  lie in the first and third quadrants, that is, those
points such that either  dx = dy = T  or  ux = uy = B.  The two maps

           g       d x d                   g       u x u
    I x I --> I x I --> I x I  and  I x I --> I x I --> I x I  

give a coalgebra structure on  I x I.  The midpoint operation may be
defined as the induced map to the final coalgebra.

Yes, after changing g(dx,uy) to g(ux,dy) in line 2 of Peter's definition
of g and similarly for line 3 (otherwise g(dx,uy) simplifies to the
nonsensical g(T,B)) Peter and I have essentially the same coalgebra on
IxI, and exactly the same after some inessential permutations within
that definition.

While I rather like Peter's nonrecursive definition

                   T v F v B             F'v F'        F'
    I --> 1 v I v 1 ------> I v I v I v I ---> I v I  --> I

of the halving map  h:I --> I sending  x  to  x/2, it should be remarked
that the effect of this map as an operation on sequences is to preserve
the empty sequence, and for nonempty sequences simply to prepend a copy
of the leading digit, e.g. -++-+000... becomes --++-+000....  (This takes
the 3-symbol alphabet for Peter's number system to be {-,0,+}.)  In other
words, right shift by one with sign extension, a well-known realization
of halving.

Along the same lines, Peter's d and u maps shift the sequence left.
If d (resp. u) shifts a + (resp. -) off the left end, the result is
replaced by the constantly + (resp. -) sequence, i.e. "clamp overflow
to +1 (resp. -1)".

Although the interval [-1,1] goes naturally with Peter's final coalgebra,
it occurrs to me that a fragment of Conway's surreal numbers is perfectly
matched to it, namely the interval [-\omega,\omega] consisting of the real
line plus two endpoints.  With respect to the Conway story this can be
described as what Conway produces by day omega, modulo infinitesimals
(identify those surreals that are only infinitesimally far apart).
At no day does exactly the real line appear in Conway's scenario.
Prior to day omega only the finite binary rationals have appeared.
Day omega sees the sudden emergence of all the reals along with 1/omega
added to and subtracted from each rational, as well as -omega and omega.
Except for -omega and omega, the quotienting eliminates the 1/omega
perturbations, yielding exactly the real line plus endpoints.

Exactly the same quotienting happens with Peter's final coalgebra, whose
elements are representable as finite and infinite strings over {-,+}
(the 0 is eliminated by allowing strings to be finite; if you want all
strings to be infinite, put 0 back in the alphabet and use it to pad the
infinite strings to infinity).  For example ---+++++... and --+----...
are identified by both Conway and Freyd.  Using Peter's choice of [-1,1]
as the represented interval, these are both -1/4.  Using Conway's number
system, these are respectively -2 - 1/omega and -2 + 1/omega, which
with the identification I described above become -2.  

In Conway's setup the finite constant sequences are the integers, with
the empty sequence being 0 and counting being done in unary.  At the
first sign reversal the bits jump mysteriously from unary to binary, not
by fiat but as a surprising consequence of a definition of addition that
on the face of is so natural that you would not dream it could cause a
radix jump like that.

So both [-1,1] and [-omega,omega] each admit a natural final coalgebra
structure for Peter's functor, namely Peter's and Conway's respectively,
and I would be surprised to see a different final coalgebra in either
case that was as natural.  In contrast, Dusko and I exhibited a number
of more or less equally convincing final coalgebra structures on [0,1)
and [0,omega) for the functor product-with-omega, no one of which I
would be willing to call *the* right one.

Starting with the closed interval, regarded as an ordered midpoint
algebra with duality, what's the best way to get the reals? My
previous answer was first to reflect the midpoint algebra in the
subcategory of abelian groups and then define the multiplication via
monotonic endomorphisms. I think there's a more natural way.

First, a re-cap of the definitions. A midpoint operation is a binary 
operation, with values here denoted as  x|y,  satisfying:
idempotence, x|x = x; commutativity, x|y = y|x; 
middle-two-interchange, (u|v)|(x|y) = (u|x)|(v|y); and cancelation,
x|y = x|z  =>  y = z.  The closed interval is a totally ordered
midpoint algebra with anti-involution, with values here denoted as  
 -x.  It follows that there's a unique element of the form  (-x)|x.  
We'll call it the center.

The middle-two-interchange law is just what is needed to see that the
monoid of midpoint-endomorphisms is itself a midpoint algebra (where
the midpoint of  f  and  g  is defined pointwise: (f|g)(x) =
(fx)|(gx)).   If  f  and  g  are both order-preserving or both order-
reversing then it's easy to see that so is  f|g.  But we'll want all 
the _monotonic_ endomorphisms (the OED defines "monotonic" as "varying
in such a way that it either never increases or never decreases") and
there's no apparent reason to expect that monotonicity is preserved by
midpointing. The wonderful fact, though, is:

    Midpoint-preserving functions between intervals are monotonic.

(The axiom of choice yields  2^{2^N}  counterexamples if the interval
is replaced by the reals.)

It follows that a midpoint-preserving function is determined by
its values on any two points. The monoid of midpoint- and duality-
preserving endo-functions on a closed interval is naturally 
isomorphic (via evaluation at Top) to the closed interval. For the
entire reals use the stalk at the center of the germs of such 
functions.


PS
For a proof suppose that  f:[-1,1] --> [-K,K]  preserves midpoints and
duality. For any  x:[-1,1]  and dyadic rational  q  such that  
qx:[-1,1], we may uniquely identify  qx  using just midpoints and
duality, hence  f(qx) = qf(x).

Suppose that  f  is not monotonic.  We wish to reach a contradiction.
Let  u < v  and  x < y  in  [-1,1]  be such that  fu < fv  and  
fx > fy.  Define  a = (-u)|v  and  b = (-x)|y  to obtain  a,b > 0  
and  fb < 0 < fa.  Let  q > 0  be a dyadic rational such that
a/b - (fa)/(bK)  <  q  <  a/b  and define  c = (-qb)|a.  Let  r  be a 
dyadic rational such that  (2K)/(fa)  <  r  <  1/c.  Then  rc  is in 
[-1,1]  but  f(rc)  can not be in  [-K,K]  (because  fc > (fa)/2).

The theorem I stated doesn't say anything about preserving duality. So
let  g  be a midpoint-preserving function between intervals. Let  a  
be the dual of the value of  g  at the center. Then the function  
\x.a|(gx)  preserves the center and continues to preserve midpoints.
Since  -x  may be uniquely identified by  (-x)|x = 0  the preservation
of the center implies preservation of the duality and  \x.a|(gx)  is
monotonic. Since  \y.a|y  not only preserves but reflects the order,
we know that  g  is monotonic.
