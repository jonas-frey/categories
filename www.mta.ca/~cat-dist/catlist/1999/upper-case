 In mathematics many structures  are named 
after some one's name. For example, Boolean 
algebra, Hermitian matrices, Hausdorff 
space, Euclidean space. The first letters of 
the person's name are usually in upper case. 
The only exception I have seen are the 
abelian group and sober space. Does any one 
know why these two cases are different from 
others?

 Thanks

First off, sober (or sobre) is not an eponym (the fancy name for these).
I often write boolean, hausdorff, and euclidean.  You sometimes see
Abelian.  So there are no standards.  Note that boolean, euclidean and
abelian have adjectival endings (as does Hermitian), while hausdorff does
not.  In French and German, the two other languages I know somewhat, it is
standard that all adjectives be in lower case, that is not so in English.
So it comes down to a matter of convention and, basically, familiarity.
In physics, it is considered a mark of great respect to achieve lower case
status.  Nearly all physical constants and units are lower case.  But
mathematicians do not accept standards conventions and journals make no
attempt to enforce uniformity in these matters.

A questionable practice in many cases, and not necessarily complimentary
to the person concerned.  For example, G. H. Hardy is famous in genetics
for a rather trivial lemma in Bayesian statistics which was his answer
to a question over High Table lunch in Trinity one day.  How on earth is
anyone meant to know what might be meant by "Gauss's Lemma/Theorem/etc"?

On the other hand, things can be knocked off inappropriate pedestals by
giving them eponymous names.  For example, what others call "simple type
theory" or "higher order intuitionistic logic" I call "Zermelo type theory"
in my book.  This has certainly given me a more balanced view of its
(limited) importance in mathematics, and I hope to have the same effect
on my readers.

Given that you're doing it, whether to use a capital depends on national
and linguistic custom. The German phrase "hilbertische Raum" looks very
peculiar to me, for example.  I was brought up to give people capital
letters, whether they're nouns or adjectives.  I tend *not* to do this
if it seems to me that usage of the word has strayed rather a long way
from what the person in question actually did, for example "cartesian
transformation" for a natural transformation whose naturality squares
are pullbacks.

Peter Freyd, who of course comes from a different culture from me, will
probably tell you his views.

Actually, many people write Abelian group and some people write cartesian
product.  I have seen boolean algebra, too.

Sober spaces are not named after a person.  A sober space is a topological
space in which every closed subspace that is not the union of proper closed
subspaces is the closure of exactly one point.  If you are sober then what
you see is really there and you don't see double!

I heard someone give this explanation at a meeting but I don't know its
history.

Just a brief comment concerning Paul's recent posting.
I don't know in which German text he found "hilbertischer Raum",
it has at least one mistake in it! Usually one says Hilbertraum,
like Banachraum, Frechetraum, etc. Also possible is Hilbertscher Raum
(without "i" after t), and hilbertscher Raum may also be acceptable.
As far as I remember (I have no relevant reference book at hand at my
current location), the rule for making out of a name an adjective by
adding sch (and the appropriate e, er - depending on declention) is
to keep the capital of the name, unless the term has become absolutely
standard (like abelsche Gruppe); to use the lower case is then regarded
as an honour to the person in question (Abel).
No more linguistics - Cheers,
Walter.

Fred Linton explains the term sober space this way:
if you haven't been drinking you don't see double
(so you don't want any pair of points belonging to
the same set of open sets) and you certainly don't
see any pink elements (irreducible closed sets
with no generic point).

(Thanks, David, but credit where credit is due.)

I can't claim the credit either: the wording above is mine, but I 
copied the idea from something written by Bill Lawvere. I can't now
find the reference, but I think it may have been in his 1976 Chicago
lecture notes on "Variable Sets, Etendu and Variable Structures in
Topoi" (of which I no longer have a copy).

Subject: categories: Alfred Sober - some recollections

Recent mention of sober spaces brought to mind memories of Alfred Philpott
Sober, whose sad death from liver failure five years ago ended a long
career in topology. Though largely unpublished, it was his work that
underlay the notion of what are now known as sober spaces.

In Sober's view, points of topological spaces are essentially blurred and
hazy: however hard you try to focus on them they always seem to jiggle
about a bit - to him "focusing on a point" meant to find it within some
_open_ neighbourhood, and these almost always left some room for manoeuvre.
He understood the points to be exactly their open neighbourhood filters,
and the spaces that would now be called non-sober were trying to impose an
over-clear view of reality, making artificial distinctions between what was
actually the same thing or trying to deny the existence of something he
could see with his own eyes.

On the related subject of continuity, he saw its essence as that of a
function was that was not unduly upset by this jiggling: as long as the
argument didn't jiggle too much, the result wouldn't either, and he liked
to demonstrate the idea by carrying a tray of drinks across a crowded room.

Though not one of the founders of locale theory, he was aware of the idea
and greatly sympathetic to it - though he couldn't see any reason for using
the French spelling and pronunciation. Once when in the midst of explaining
his ideas the lattice structures started to become manifest and he would
excitedly talk about "getting down to the local".

He studied initially at Cambridge under the influence of Charles Wells (the
Bedford Charles Wells, NOT the well-known category theorist) and his
thesis, starting off on Klein bottles, soon took in Gross bottles too. He
made his academic home in the University of Portsmouth and was much loved
by both his colleagues and his students for his parties and for his
never-failing warm welcome "Come in and what'll you have?" He is much
missed by all who knew him.
