When I first introduced the notions of algebraically complete
categories (every endo-functor has an initial algebra) and
algebraically compact categories (every endo-functor has an initial
algebra naturally isomorphic to a terminal co-algebra) I thought that
such things would exist in the classical foundations only in
degenerate form. It was a surprise when I noticed that the categories
of countable sets and of countably dimensioned vector spaces are
algebraically complete. I'm now surprised by:

  The category of separable Hilbert spaces and linear operators of
  bound at most  1  is algebraically compact.

As in the earlier cases one doesn't really need the controlling
cardinal number to be aleph-naught. To avoid using the axiom of choice
one can state the more general result by taking an arbitrary Hilbert
space  A  and defining  *A*  by:
  Objects of  *A*:  all those Hilbert spaces that can be isometrically
       embedded in  A;
  Maps of  *A*: all linear operators thereon of bound at most  1.

Then:
         *A*  is algebraically compact.

The theorem holds for both the real and complex cases.

In the proof I use the surprising (to me) fact that in the categories
in question every half-invertible map has a _unique_ half-inverse.
(That is, every map has at most one left-inverse and one right-
inverse.) All the other examples from nature that I can think of are
categories in which the only half-invertibles are invertible. Are
there others?

On request:

Theorem:

  The category of separable Hilbert spaces and linear operators of
  bound at most  1  is algebraically compact.

More generally,

Theorem:

  Let  A  be a Hilbert space.  Let  *A*  be the category whose objects
  are all Hilbert spaces that can be isometrically embedded in  A  and
  whose maps are all linear operators therebetween of bound at most 1.
  Then  *A*  is algebraically compact.

(The axiom of choice says that the objects of  *A*  can be described
as all Hilbert spaces of (orthonormal) dimension bounded by a given
cardinal.) The proofs work for both the real and complex cases.

For the proof we'll need a few lemmas about  *A*  and its
endofunctors. First note that any isometric embedding  B -> C  is
a retract with the adjoint operator  C -> B  serving as its right-
inverse. Left to the reader is the surprising fact (to me) that right-
inverses are unique. So are left-inverses. That is, in  *A*  every map
has at most one right-inverse and one left-inverse and all left-
inverses are isometric embeddings and all right-inverses are
orthogonal projections.

Because any functor preserves the existence of right-inverses we may
conclude that any given endofunctor, T, carries isometric embeddings
to isometric embeddings. For convenience we'll replace  T  with a
naturally equivalent functor that is invariant on the lattice of
subobjects of  A  (that is, the subcategory of all closed subspaces of
A  and all inclusion maps therebetween). First choose a single
isometric embedding  TA -> A.  For each  A' contained in  A  define
T'A'  to be the image of TA' -> TA -> A  where  TA' -> TA  is  T
applied to the inclusion map  A' -> A. Let  TA' -> T'A' be the obvious
isomorphism. For all objects, B, not contained in  A  define  T'B  to
be  TB  and  TB -> T'B  to be the identity map. Define  T' to be the
unique endofunctor that turns this collection of isomorphisms into a
natural equivalence. For an inclusion map  A' -> A  we have that
T'A' -> T'A  is an inclusion map. And from that we may conclude that
any inclusion map between subobjects of  A  is carried by  T' to an
inclusion map.

We'll drop the dash-mark on  T  and notationally assume that our given
functor preserves the lattice of subobjects of  A. At this point it is
clear (a la Tarski) what the initial T-algebra must be: any
endofunctor on a complete lattice has a minimal fixed point, indeed,
to domain theorists (a CS term) it is clear how to prove it to be the
initial T-algebra: start by using the bottom-up construction for the
minimal fixed-point for  T  as it operates on the lattice of
subobjects of  A. Define an ordinal sequence of subspaces of  A  as
follows: for a limit ordinal 'a, take  F['a]  to be the supremum of
the previous values; for a successor ordinal  1+'b  take  F[1+'b]  to
be  T(F['b]). Note that for the limit ordinal  0  we have that  F[0]
is the trivial (one-element) subspace.  And note that for all other
limit ordinals, 'a, we have that  F['a]  is the closure of the union
of the previous values. By an inductive argument this sequence is an
increasing sequence (but, of course, not forever strictly increasing):
for a limit ordinal 'a, we have that F['b] < F['a]  for all  'b < 'a
(using  <  for the containment sign) hence  T(F['b]) < T(F['a])  that
is, F[1+'b] < F[1+'a]  for all 'b < 'a  and the construction of  F['a]
forces F['a] < T(F['a]) = F[1+'a]; for a successor ordinal  1+'b  we
may (inductively) assume that  F['b] < F[1+'b]  hence
T(F['b]) < T(F[1+'b]), that is, F[1+'b] < F[1+1+'b].

The sequence can not forever be strictly increasing. It stabilizes at
a value  F.  We take  'c  as the first limit ordinal such that
F = F['c].  We need that  F  is not just the supremum of the
constructing sequence as defined in the lattice but its colimit as
defined in the entire category. Actually we need the general fact that
for any limit ordinal 'a  it is the case that  F['a]  is the colimit
of the ordinal diagram of previous values. The proof is straigh-
forward using again the fact that the maps in the category are of
bound at most  1.)

Given a  T-algebra  b:TB -> B  we must construct a map  x:F -> B  so
that
         F
    Tx /   \ x
      TB -> B
         b          (add downward arrowheads).

We define, inductively, a sequence of maps  x['b]:F['b] -> B  such
that
           x['b]                         T(x['b])     b
     F['b] -----> B  =  F['b] -> F[1+'b] --------> FB -> B

where the unlabeled map is the inclusion map. For successor-ordinals
define  x[1+'b]  as
                     T(x['b])     b
             F[1+'b] --------> FB -> B.

The inductive verification that

             x[1+'b]                             T(x[1+'b])     b
     F[1+'b] -------> B  =  F[1+'b] -> F[1+1+'b] ----------> FB -> B

is straight-forward diagram chasing.

For limit-ordinals define  x['a]:F['a] -> B  using the fact that F['a]
is a colimit of the previous values. For the verification of

           x['a]                         T(x['a])     b
     F['a] -----> B  =  F['a] -> F[1+'a] --------> FB -> B

it suffices to verify, for each  'b < 'a, that

               x['a]                                T(x['a])     b
F['b] -> F['a] -----> B = F['b] -> F['a] -> F[1+'a] --------> FB -> B

where, just as before, each unlabeled arrow is an inclusion map. This
follows, inductively, from the two equations

                  x['a]              x['b]
   F['b] -> F['a] -----> B  =  F['b] -----> B,   and

   F['b] -> F['a] -> F[1+'a]  =  F['b] -> F[1+'b] -> F[1+'a]

where the last map (still an inclusion map) is the result of applying
T  to the inclusion map from  F['b]  to  F['a].

The uniqueness can be verified, inductively, for each 'b.
Alternatively, given a possibly different solution  y:F -> B, let
A' be the equalizer of  x  and  y  using the standard construction:
A' is the closed subspace of points on which  x  and  y  agree. It
follows that  T(A')  is contained in  A', that is, A' is a "prefixed
point" of  T.  But -- as is clear from the top-down construction --
minimal fixed points are automatically minimal prefixed points and  F
must be contained in  A'.

We have shown that  T  has an initial algebra (that is, the category
is algebraically complete). Since the category is self-dual (via the
adjoint-operator construction) it follows that  T  also has a final
co-algebra (that is, the category is algebraically co-complete). But
for compactness we need the two to be naturally isomorphic. We have
reduced to the case that the structure map on the initial algebra is
the identity map which means that the naturally isomorphic co-algebra
is given by the same identity map. That is, we must show for every
b:B -> TB  the existence of a unique  x:B -> F  such that
(add downward arrowheads)                     b
                                            B -> TB
                                           x \  / Tx
                                               F.

F is not just the colimit of the ordinal sequence of inclusion maps,
it's the limit of the ordinal sequence of their adjoint operators, the
orthogonal projections. The comments at the very beginning, that  T
necessarily preserves the unique right-inverses, says that this
ordinal sequence of orthogonal projections has all the requisite
properties for the (dual) of the proof we've just seen. Done.

Having done all this I must now note that my original purpose for
algebraic compactness has been frustrated: the fact that contravariant
functors and mixed-variance functors have minimal invariant objects
was already evident for this category. I'm refering to the general
theorem that given any algebraically compact category and  "sesqui"-
endofunctor, TXY, contravariant on  X, covariant on Y, there's a
T-invariant object, that is, an object  F  together with an
isomorphism from  TFF  to  F; indeed there is a _minimal_ T-invariant
object, that is, one that appears uniquely as a natural retract of
every T-invariant object. The trouble is that if we replace  TXY  with
TX'Y,  where  X'  denotes the adjoint-operator functor (which, note,
is the identity operation on objects) then it's easy to see that the
intial algebra of  TX'Y  is as desired. That is, algebraic
completeness is enough when in the presence of an anti-involution that
fixes identity maps.

I haven't checked the precise claim, but I think that what Peter claims
is in my paper in JPAA in 1992 called Algebraically Compact Functors.
The paper was, if I recall correctly, transmitted by guess who.  Actually,
Peter asked me in 1990 when I was leave at Penn if this were true.
The paper is also available for ftp (don't tell North-Holland).
I haven't studied Peter's argument, so I don't know how much it differs
from mine.  Actually, I haven't look at mine in several years either.
A similar category, with a similar result is that of sets are injective
partial functions.  Interestingly, if you want to know on what category
it is natural to define l^2 as a functor, it is sets and partial injections.

Peter,

Do you have any interesting examples of ``domain equations'' over this
category?
There is certainly no model of the lambda calculus there.

In answer to the obvious query: yes, I did indeed check the standard
sources before I let that word pass. And I decided the standard
sources need to be improved.

Now I must agree we've lived all these years without feeling the need
for yet another adverb that starts out with "there-". The O.E.D. lists
38 of them:

  thereabout, thereabove, thereafter, thereafterward, thereagain,
  thereagainst, thereamong, thereat, thereaway, therebefore,
  therebeside, thereby, theredown, thereforth, therefrom, therehence,
  therein, thereinto, there-nigh, thereof, thereon, thereout,
  thereover, therethrough, theretill, thereto, theretofore,
  theretoward, thereunder, thereuntill, thereunto, thereup, thereupon,
  thereward, therewhile, therewith, therewithal, therewithin

But none of these works as a replacement for "therebetween" in either
of the following two lines from my recent missive:

  the category whose objects are all Hilbert spaces that can be
  isometrically embedded in  A  and whose maps are all linear
  operators therebetween of bound at most  1.

  the subcategory of all closed subspaces of  A  and all inclusion
  maps therebetween.

So why not shoot for 39?

Best thoughts,
  Peter

As my last paragraph tried to make clear, we can't expect much.  If we
define Hom(X,Y) as (adj X) tensor Y then the functor

     A directsum Hom(x,Y)

 looks as if it ought to have an interesting fixed point.  It doesn't.
