Subject: categories: geometric formulae and axioms

Dear category theorists, 

Recently I came across geometric formulae (built up from atomic formulae
using only conjunction, disjunction and existential quantification).  I
would know like to know whether there is any way to decide whether an
arbitrary given first order formula is (classically) equivalent to a
geometric formula (or geometric axiom: phi -> psi where phi and psi are
both geometric formulae).  I've looked in the book by Mac Lane and Moerdijk
but didn't discover a general decision method.  Any hints or references
to relevant literature would be much appreciated.

Best regards,
Karel Stokkermans

	Yes, this question is disussed in Kieslers' paper on "Generalized Atomic
Formulas" from the early 1960s. The third name , which I prefer, for the
class is simply "positive" formulas. They are of course a key tool in the
Presentations of a Positive Theory. 
	This may not agree exactly with some
previous uses of the term "positive", since the not-so-innocuous use of
universal prefixes has been eliminated along with the excessive
burden that had been put on the single element "TRUE"; the presentation
machinery for positive theories must involve a BINARY relation of
entailment (for each admitted arity of formula) in place of the single
0-ary relation of provability. This is actually a simplication rather than
a complication although that may not have been clear in the 1930s As far as
 expressive power is concerned, one can say that for Boolean models (as
opposed to models in more general toposes) positive theories are as
general as what have been called "standard presentation first order
theories" : Any particular negation occurring in a presentation of one of
the latter can be replaced by a new primitive relation symbol, nailed to
what it is to negate by the usual pair of lattice (hence positive) new
axioms.
	The geometric role of positive theories is that via
 the classifying-topos construction they provide a standard way
to geometrically visualize models of arbitrary theories via the
 algebraic-geometry paridigm (ie via the body of mathematics created by
Kan, Isbell, Grothendieck, and Yoneda in the decade 1954-1964). Of course,
one of the theories which most interested the model theory pioneers
Birkhoff, Robinson, and Tarski was the theory of commutative rings, so
this extension may seem as natural to us as it did to them.
	Kiesler's paper shows us that the explicit relation between
positivity and preservation under morphisms was recognized clearly quite
a long time ago. Are there papers which also draw the conclusion that the 
"standard" theories and presentations should really be the positive ones,
with negation as a cared-for particular rather than a blanket general ? 
	Whether the possibility of recursive presentability of a given
mathematical concept might vary under this change is not clear to me.(Of
course "quantifier elimination" in some cases changes to an exceptional
"quantifier definability"). Also, the original question concerning whether
(for example) the inclusion, of a positive theory into the associated
theory in the doctrine which has negation and universal quantifiers, is
itself recursive qua inclusion, probably has a negative answer, but I
don't have a reference.

For myself, the short answer is I don't know.

Perhaps I ought to, since I've made lots of geometric theries out of
classical ones, but in practice the problem goes further than a strict
answer to the question would provide. One often needs not just to transform
the theories within a fixed language but to tranform the language itself. A
simple example is negation as "cared-for particular" to use Bill's phrase.
It is especially true once one starts using the full geometric logic, with
infinitary disjunctions (unlike the coherent logic in Mac Lane and
Moerdijk). One then sees, for instance, that geometric logic is actually
weak second order, with universal quantification bounded over finite sets.

Subject: categories: geometric formulas

	Karel Stokkermans asked about a decision procedure for checking
whether an arbitrary given first-order formula is classically equivalent
to a geometric one.  There is no such algorithm.  The reason is that any
such algorithm could easily be converted into an algorithm for testing
(classical, first-order) validity, which is well-known to be undecidable. 
To test a formula A for validity, take a 0-ary predicate symbol P that
doesn't occur in A, and let A' be the formula "A or not P".  Then A' is
equivalent to a geometric formula (namely "true") if and only if A is
valid.  So just test A' for geometricity and you'll know whether A is
valid.  (If, like some textbook authors, you don't believe in 0-ary
predicate symbols, use P(x) instead, where P is unary.) 
	Bill Lawvere asked whether there are "papers which also draw the
conclusion that the 'standard' theories and presentations should really be
positive ones, with negation as a cared-for particular rather than a
blanket general".  I assume he means papers where this is done for a
purpose other than having geometric theories or the nice things that come
with them, like classifying topoi.  In a paper that Yuri Gurevich and I
wrote long ago ["Existential fixed-point logic" in "Computation Theory and
Logic", edited by Egon Boerger, Springer Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 270
(1987) pp.20-36], we found it convenient to adopt the following
convention, which though not quite what Bill described, is similar in
spirit: A first-order language (or signature or similarity-type) should
have its predicate symbols classified into two sorts, positive and
negatable.  Negation can be applied only to atomic formulas whose
predicate symbol is negatable.  Homomorphisms are required to preserve the
interpretations of all predicate symbols and to reflect the
interpretations of the negatable ones.
