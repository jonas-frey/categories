Subject: duality in 2-categories

Does anyone know a good treatment of duality in 2-categories?
I'm interested in situations where the objects have duals
but also the objects in the Hom-categories have duals.  I
guess Fischer discusses this in his paper on 2-categories and
2-knots, but I'm looking for a more detailed and extended
treatment.

Regards,
John
