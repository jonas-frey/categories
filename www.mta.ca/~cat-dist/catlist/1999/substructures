What results of the form  `A sub-X of a free X is free' are known?
I am aware of groups, magmas (= set with binary operation), and
modules over a principal ideal domain. I'd be interested to hear of
structures for which this is either known to be true, or examples
where it fails.

It is true for abelian groups, but is false for both monoids and
commutative monoids.  The free (commutative) monoid on one element x
has a submonoid consisting of 1,x^3,x^5,x^6 and all x^n for n > 7
is not free.  Throwing away 1, you get counter-examples for
semigroups and commutative semigroups.  By taking the free abelian
group on this example, you get counter-examples for rings and
commutative rings.  I am sure that it is a fairly rare occurrence.

John Stell asked when to expect subobjects of free objects to be free
and observed that such is the case for modules over prinicpal ideal
domains. For commutative rings that's the only case: if every ideal is
free as a module then the ring is a PID.

He points out that subalgebras of free algebras are free if the theory
consists of just one binary operation and no equations. Isn't that the
case for any equationless theory?

There is certainly a good bit more known than in Michael's response. The
varieties in which subalgebras of free algebras are free are called Schreier
varieties. A paper of mine in the early 70's -- Epimorphisms and dominions, V,
probably in Alg. Univ. -- answered someone's question (Sabbagh?): Is every
Schreier variety balanced? I remember the answer was No. John Isbell

There are a lot of counterexamples examples in the topological case. There
is also a lot of work on the profinite case (open subgroups of free
profinite groups are free profinite). Brown and Hardy proved open
subgroups of free topological groups are free topological (various
k_{\omega} conditions used) (JLMS (2)10 (1975) 431-440).Sid Morris has a
good survey in Categorical Topology (Proceedings Toledo 1983, ed HLBentley
et al).  I have a paper in Proc AMS 52 (1975) 433-441 giving examples of
non projective closed subgroups of the free topological group on [a,b]
(e.g. the subgroup generated by {a} and x^2 for x \in [a,b], has \pi_0 =
Z_2, which is not free).

The discussion and responses on sub-structures of free structures
got me thinking about a problem that bothered to me some time a go.

Suppose an equational class  V  has the following property:


(1) if A and B are FINITELY GENERATED V-agebras whose coproduct is
free, then A and B are both free.

Does this imply that  V  has the prorerty that

(2) if A and B are ANY V-agebras whose coproduct is free, then A and
B are both free?

I proved in 1983 that the variety of vector-lattices (= abelian
lattice-ordered groups with order-preserving action by positive real
numbers)  has (1), using PL topology.  (In the variety of
vector-lattices, projective does not imply free, so this result has
some content.)  In fact, if  V = vector-lattices, the following is
true:

(1a) if A and B are ANY V-agebras whose coproduct is FINITELY
GENERATED and free, then A and B are both free.


BUT, I was never able to show that the variety of vector-lattices has
(2).



Does (2) follow from (1) or from (1a) by any general theorems of
universal algebra, model-theory, etc.?
