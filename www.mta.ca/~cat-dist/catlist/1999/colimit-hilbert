I'm interested in colimits in the category of Hilbert spaces
with isometries as morphisms.  Is there a good reference on
when these exist?

I don't know a reference, but I know that very few colimits exist.
For example, the sum of two non-zero spaces cannot exist for you can
give the direct sum of the normed spaces either the sup or euclidean
norm and these would both have to embed isometrically in the sum,
which is clearly impossible.  Clearly coequalizers are likewise
precluded.  It seems possible that filtered colimits might make it;
you would take the ordinary colimit as inner product spaces and
complete.  I don't offhand see what can go wrong with that.
