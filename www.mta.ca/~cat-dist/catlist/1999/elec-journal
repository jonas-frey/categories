Following this is the abstract of the recently published first article in 
the electronic journal, Theory and Applications of Categories. 

IF YOU WISH TO RECEIVE ABSTRACTS OF FUTURE ARTICLES IN THE JOURNAL, PLEASE
SUBSCRIBE TO THE JOURNAL, IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY DONE SO. 

You can subscribe by simply sending your full name and postal address in 
an email with subject `subscription' to tac@mta.ca. Subscription is free.

There are two reasons for requiring a separate subscription to the
journal. First, subscribers to one of the categories mailing list or the
electronic journal may not be interested in the other. Secondly, while
access to the journal is free and open over the Internet, it is obviously
useful to have a base of known subscribers.  You may rest assured that the
subscription list will not be used externally. 

Regards to all,
Bob Rosebrugh

chain complexes and show that all three are naturally homotopic to
ordinary singular chain complexes.
