This is probably a trivial question, but I would appreciate
any pointer to a solution:

Let A be a denumerable set and A* be the set of finite sequences of A.
It is easy to show (by defining two injections) that the set (A* x A*) is
isomorphic (as a set) to (A x 2)* -- where 2 is a two element set and x
the Cartesian product.  The question is how to exhibit the isomorphism
(actually the 2 obvious injections are not mutually inverse).

Thanks.

The usual proof of the Cantor/Schroeder/Bernstein Theorem (cf., e.g., Halmos'
{Naive Set Theory}) gives quite an explicit construction of a bijection given
two injections of each set in the other.  Of course there is considerable
leeway -- reversing the roles of the two injections usually results in quite
a different bijection from that found originally.

Perhaps the point to emphasize is that, once there are any bijections at all,
there are probably embarrassingly many, and the article "the" (in the phrase
"the bijection") is surely a red herring.

Concerning Luis Soares Barbosa's question about the isomorphism in set
of A^* x A^* and (A x 2)^* for countable A:

Just because two sets are countable doesn't mean there has to exist
a *canonical* isomorphism.  The only canonical function in this setting
is induced by the monoid structure:  A x 2 in set is (canonically!)
isomorphic to A + A (where + means coproduct, i.e., disjoint union in
set).  The free monoid functor (-)^* is left adjoint and hence
preserves coproducts, i.e., (A + A)^* =~ A^* + A^* in mon, the category
of monoids (where the coproduct is *not* given by disjoint union).
Now the two projections from A^* x A^* to A^* in mon have left inverses
(pairing with the empty sequence), hence the universal property of the
coproduct induces a canonical monoid-homomorphism from A^* + A^* to
A^* x A^*.  Incidentally, the two "injections" from A^* to A^* + A^*
both have right inverses in mon, hence the universal property of the
product induces a canonical monoid-homomorphism from A^* + A^* to
A^* x A^*, which coincides with the first one!  Although defined by
"general abstract nonsense", this homomorphism is easily understood:
it decomposes sequences of red and blue elements of A into the red and
the blue subsequence.  Clearly, this is not injective.  We might say
that "morally", A^* + A^* is larger than A^* x A^*.  That for countable
A the underlying sets have the same size is just an accident.

There's a good category question here. View  (A x 2)*  and  A* x A*
as functors on the category of non-empty sets and Show that they are
naturally equivalent.  It's not hard if you switch to the category
of pointed sets (whereon each is naturally equivalent to  A*).

Fred Linton's comment re Cantor--Bernstein is of course correct,
provided you assume classical logic. However, Barbosa's question
makes sense in any topos with a natural number object, and it's
well known that Cantor--Bernstein can fail in non-Boolean toposes.
Is there always an isomorphism A* x A* =~ (A x 2)* in such a topos?
I suspect the answer is yes, but it may take some ingenuity to
construct it.

There's almost certainly a constructive proof of the
Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem in the circumstances that you
describe, which would necessarily contain a construction of a
bijection given two appropriate injections --- it wouldn't be hard to
makes this as explicit as you like.
If you really want to exhibit this isomorphism explicitly, this
suggests to me that your looking for something like an algorithm: If
this is not the case, then even a non-constructive proof would do if
you're prepared to a allow primitive corresponding to the law of the
excluded middle in the recipe for your isomorphism --- it's just not
always obvious how to interpret this in any computational sense.

Alternatively, you could simply introduce some mutant
lexicographic-type ordering on each of the two sets (using the
ubiquitous `diagonal' trick (that's not diagonalisation) if necessary,
i.e. if A is infinite).

Neither of these suggestions is perceptibly natural or canonical i'm
afraid, but i rather suspect that there is no particularly
distinguished candidate with respect to the level of structure that
you describe.

If we put F(A)=(A* x A*) and G(A)= (A x 2)* for any set A
we obtain two functors F,G:Sets -->Sets.
Are they naturally isomorphic?
This is not the original question but a related one.
Observe that both functors are analytic, which means that they have
a power series expansion:

 F(A)= sum_n n A^n  and   G(A)= sum_n 2^n A^n

The two power series are different and it follows
that F is not isomorphic to G.

Andre's analytic functors do it all. As he points out, they answer,
negatively, the question I put (answering it, note, before he could
have read my question). And they provide a much nicer proof than the
one I had in mind for the category of strict maps between pointed
sets. Well, yeah, I didn't notice that my "not hard" proof was only
good for what the CS people call "strict maps." What it comes to is
that if you first apply the functor  \A. 1+A  and then Andre's
functors  F , G  you get isomorphic functors:

   ((1+A) x 2)*    =     (1+A)* x (1+A)*

because in each case you get

    sum_n  Nx(A^n).

Andre Joyal's neat argument not only shoots down Peter Freyd's conjectured
extension of Barbosa's question, it also shoots down mine (i.e. does the
isomorphism (A* x A*) =~ (A x 2)* hold for A an object of a non-Boolean
topos with NNO?) Take E to be the object classifier (i.e. the functor
category [Set_f,Set]) and A to be the generic object of this topos (i.e.
the inclusion functor Set_f --> Set). Then (A* x A*) and (A x 2)* are
simply the restrictions to Set_f of Andre's functors F and G, and these
are already non-isomorphic (since both functors are finitary).

If we have a 1-1 correspondance between A and the set N of natural numbers,
then this reduces to N* x N* =~ (N x 2)*, and constructive proofs of N* =~
N and N x N =~ N are easy, so presumably this will work in any topos with a
NNO.

On the other hand, A* x A* =~ (A x 2)* for all A implies excluded middle.
An informal argument follows:

Suppose A* x A* =~ (A x 2)* for all A.  Let phi be a proposition.  We show
phi or not phi.  Take a and b such that a=b iff phi; it suffices to show
a=b or not a=b.  Let A be the set {a,b}.

Let f : (A x 2)* --> A* x A* and g : (A* x A*) --> (A x 2)* be inverse.

We take 2 = {0,1} for convenience.
First look at f applied to x in S = {<(x,0),(y,0),(z,0)> | x,y,z in A}

The images of each of these is in the form (<c_1,...,c_m>,<d_1,...,d_n>).

If either m or n depends on x in S, then f is non-constant, S is not a
singleton, and so not a=b.

Alternatively m, n don't depend on x in S (we're using excluded middle for
equality on natural numbers).  Let T = {(<x_1,...,x_m>,<y_1,...,y_n>) | x,y
in A}.  Consider the g(w) for w in T.  If these are not all in the form
(x,0),(y,0),(z,0), then we have two distinct members of T, so not a=b.
Otherwise, g and f restrict to a bijection between S and T.  If not m+n =
3, then we have A^i =~ A^j with not i=j and it follows that a=b.

Otherwise, we are left with m+n=3.

We now repeat with this with S = {<(x,i),(y,j),(z,k)>|x,y,z in A}, for each
of the other seven possibilities of i,j,k in {0,1}.  There are two
possibilities: either eventually we obtain (a=b or not a=b), or we find for
all 8 triples (i,j,k), some m and n such that m+n=3.  But the latter case
is impossible: as f and g are bijections, different triples (i,j,k) must
give different pairs (m,n), a contradiction as there are eight triples, but
only four pairs.

[We've implicitly used the following fact: If n is a natural number, and
psi(x) is decideable for all x in A^n, then psi(x) for all x in A^n, is
also decidable]

I would like to correct an error in my power series expansion of
A* x A*. You might have already noticed it.
The correct expansion is

   A* x A* = sum_n (n+1) x A^n

Of course, the error does not affect the proof
that A* x A* is not isomorphic to (2 x A)*
as a functor from Sets to Sets.

Peter is right about the isomorphism between the functors
F(X+1) and G(X+1) where F(A)=A* x A* and G(A)=(2 x A)*.

It might be worth to notice that
if we substitute the category Sets, of sets and all maps,
by the category Bi of sets and bijections then
F and G become isomorphic as functors Bi -->Sets.
In this case Cantor's argument applies since the
category of functors Bi-->Sets is a Boolean topos
(and since there are natural injections F>-->G
and G>-->F in this category).

However, if we substitute the category Sets by
the category In of sets and injections then it can be shown
F and G are not isomorphic as functors In -->Sets.

Given total enumerations of A and B (in other words bijections N -> A
and N -> B), there are standard ("canonical") constructions that
produce total enumerations of A*, A x 2, A x B, and so on, using
primitive recursive functions, which are thus available in any topos
with natural numbers object.  For example, the Cantor Pairing Function

    <x,y> = ((x+y)^2 + 3x + y)/2

is a bijection N x N -> N.  (In fact, by the Fueter-Polya theorem, it
is the unique such bijection up to swapping x and y that is given by a
quadratic polynomial with real coefficients.)  Similarly, the function
mapping N* to N given by the dyadic coding

    <a0,...,an> |-> 2^a0 + 2^{a0+a1+1} + ... + 2^{a0+...+an + n}

(the empty sequence is coded by 0) is a "primitive recursive"
bijection in the extended sense where lists are a recursive data
type.

By appropriately composing these enumerations and their inverses, one
gets canonical bijections between any two sets built from totally
enumerated sets using x, *, and so on, by going from one of the sets
back to N and then from N to the other set.
