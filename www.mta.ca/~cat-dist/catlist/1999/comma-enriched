Subject: categories: Comma categories 

Does any body know if comma categories have been defined in
enriched contexts?

I have an idea of how they can be defined in some particular
contexts, such as Cat-categories or Simplicial-categories, but I
don't know if there is a general definition or even if a
definition in the above two contexts can be found in the
literature.

Thanks

I'm not sure if it's what you have in mind, but combining comma categories
and enrichment is the theme of

Lawvere's La Jolla paper, where general comma categories were introduced,
showed how to construct them from pullbacks and a "cylinder" (or "arrow
object") construction.  John Gray (SLNM p. 254) showed that cylinder is a
universal notion which a 2-category may or may not have. I pointed out
[Fibrations and Yoneda's lemma in a 2-category, Lecture Notes in Math. 420
(1974) 104-133;     MR53#585] that finite completeness for a 2-category
should mean that it have pullbacks, a terminal object, and cylinders (a
similar idea was in my PhD thesis for differential graded categories which
are finitely complete when they admit pullbacks, a zero object and
"suspension"). Finite completeness for 2-categories is further analysed in
[Limits indexed by category-valued 2-functors, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 8
(1976) 149-181; MR53#5695].

More generally, finite completeness for a V-category  A (= a category with
homs enriched in  V) means that its underlying category has finite ordinary
limits, which are preserved by representables  A(a,-)  into  V,  and that
it admits cotensoring by the "finite" objects of  V.  There is some choice
about what you mean by "finite" object in  V  however "finitely
presentable" is often the right thing.  Sometimes, as in the case of  V =
Cat, the finite objects are generated by a few finite objects - that is why
"cylinder" plays the important role in 2-categories (it is the finite
generating object, cotensor with which is cylinder).

So why am I going on about finite limits in 2-categories?  Well, Lawvere's
construction shows that comma objects exist in any finitely complete
2-category.  Comma objects are particular finite limits just like
pullbacks.

In particular, there is a 2-category  V-Cat  of V-categories, V-functors
and V-natural transformations.  It is certainly complete (as a 2-category)
for any decent  V.   So, indeed, it is well known that comma objects (or
comma V-categories) exist.  They have their uses but NOT for the wonderful
use that Lawvere put them to:  Lawvere provided a formula for left (right)
Kan extensions of ordinary functors which involves taking a colimit (limit)
over a comma category. [Indeed, more is true; see my definition of
"pointwise Kan extension" in "Fibrations and Yoneda's lemma in a
2-category".]  However, this formula does not work even for additive
categories (= categories enriched in the monoidal category of abelian
groups).

A crucial point is whether the recipient of the enriching is cartesian or
not. Note that fully internalising always must involve a cartesian aspect
since one must diagonalize on the parametrizers of families of objects 
(at least) in order to explain eg natural transformations, even if the
parametrizers for individual homs are not cartesian (eg linear or metric).

One can envisage replacing individual "comma" categories by families of
categories parametrized by (commutative) coalgebras, which seems just a
way of constructing a cartesian category for the purpose, to which it may
or may not be adequate. 

Symmetric monoidal categories in which the unit object is terminal seem to
have a special role, but that may be illusory.(After all "any" smc is
covered by one with that additional property) . Perhaps the affine modules
( see my paper "Grassmann's dialectics and category theory") constitute a
good test case for proposed constuctions

Dear Carlos

Comma categories are explained, for example, in Mac Lane's book "Categories
for the working mathematician" Grad Texts in Math #5 (Springer). In a sense
they are "lax pullbacks" defined when given two functors with the same
codomain. Hence, just as we can carry over the notion of pullback in Set to
any category, we can carry over, by representability, the notion of comma
category from Cat to any 2-category (I call them comma objects in SLNM
420).

Exaggerating only slightly, the whole reason enriched category theory got
going in the 60s was to deal with the example of differential graded
categories: these are categories enriched in chain complexes
(Eilenberg-Kelly "Closed categories" LaJolla 1965).  As I understand it,
that example prompted Sammy and Max to their joint work: they had each used
DG-categories before.

My thesis [0] was not published in full. For the published papers [2], [5]
on the thesis, I took out the stuff on DG-categories. However, [25] uses
the DG-category approach very strongly and gives new proofs of more general
results (I had some of these at the time of my thesis but hadn't included
them). The papers provide universal coefficients (or homotopy
classification) theorems for diagrams of chain complexes.
