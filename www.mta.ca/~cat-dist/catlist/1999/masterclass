Dear colleagues,

We have a one year preliminary program at Utrecht for which we accept a number
of fully funded students. The courses this year relate to sheaves, knots, etc,
so will interest some category theorists. I would be grateful if you could
bring this to the attention of your students.

Ieke Moerdijk.

Master Class 1996-1997

Mathematical Research Institute
The Mathematical Research Institute (MRI) in The Netherlands has been set up
jointly by the mathematics departments of the universities of Groningen,
Nijmegen, Twente and Utrecht. Its aim is to promote research, organise graduate
courses and seminars, and stimulate international contacts and exchange. The
MRI is one of the main mathematical institutes in The Netherlands.
 Master Class
The MRI organises a Master Class (MC). Every year three parallel MC programmes
are offered, each with its own topic. These are 1-year programmes of lectures,
seminars and a test problem
for bright undergraduate students and beginning graduate students of any
nationality. The MC student follows one of these programmes. The language for
all MC activities is English.

Students who have successfully completed a Master Class programme can apply for
admission to the Graduate Studies Programme (GSP) of the MRI. Studies in the
GSP can take 4 years and aim at a doctoral thesis, based on original
mathematical research. Admission to the GSP is subject to a severe selection
procedure.

Topics for the Master Class 1996-97
# Numerical Analysis and Supercomputing
# Stochastics and Operations Research
# Complex Geometry and Topology

 Each programme includes
# two full days of lectures and seminars per week,
# a test problem: individual work on a mathematical
problem under the guidance of a tutor.

The programme runs from September 1st until June 30th. There are two blocks of
courses of about thirteen weeks each. Participants are
expected to become actively involved in seminars, workshops, discussions.
Time will also be reserved for preparing for the examinations and for work on
the test
problem.

In 1996-97 the following courses will be offered:

NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND SUPERCOMPUTING
# Seminar: Numerical solution of nonlinear problems (O. Axelsson)
# Finite element and boundary element methods (B. Polman)
# Splines and wavelets (C. Traas)
# Numerical treatment of surfacewaves (P. Zandbergen)
# Subspace methods for linear problems and eigenproblems (H. van der Vorst/G.
Sleijpen)
# Seminar: Preconditioning techniques (H. van der Vorst/G. Sleijpen)
# Elliptic boundary value problems (J. Duistermaat)
# either: Numerical programming (R. Bisseling)
or: Supercomputers and numerical linear algebra (O. Axelsson)

STOCHASTICS AND OPERATIONS RESEARCH
# Algorithmic methods in mathematical operations research (U. Faigle, W. Kern)
# Seminar: Stochastic models in applied operations research (W. Nawijn)
# Stochastic processes (M. van Zuijlen, E. van Doorn)
# Stochastic analysis (F. den Hollander, H. Maassen)
# Non-parametric statistics (B. Levit)
# Seminar: Quantum stochastics (R. Gill)
# Time series analysis (H. Dehling, T. Mikosch)
# Seminar: Spatial stochastics (H. Dehling, A. van Enter, J. Roerdink)

COMPLEX GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY
# Sheaves and algebraic topology (W. van der Kallen, I. Moerdijk)
# Complex geometry (E. Looijenga)
# Riemann-Hilbert correspondence on  P^1 (F. Beukers, G. Heckman)
# Introduction to singularities (D. Siersma, J. Steenbrink)
# D-modules (J. Steenbrink, R. van Doorn)
# Intersection homology (W. van der Kallen, I. Moerdijk)
# Arrangements of hyperplanes (M. Hazewinkel, D. Siersma) # Seminar on
hypergeometric functions (G. Heckman, E. Opdam, J.
Stienstra)

Examination and certificate
Each participant is required to take examinations on the courses and to present
a written account of his/her work on the test problem. When the examinations
and the test problem are successfully passed a
certificate will be awarded.

Expenses and fellowships
The fee for admission to the MC, including tuition fees, is Dfl. 5,000.
Since the MC activities take place in different cities the participants should
expect expenses up to Dfl. 1,500 per year for travelling in the Netherlands.
Moreover, there will be expenses for visa and for travelling to and from the
Netherlands.
The other normal costs of living (including housing and insurance) can be
estimated at Dfl. 1,200 per month.

The MRI can only offer a very limited number of fellowships for
participation in the MC.
Foreign students are therefore requested to apply for scholarships or funding
in their
home country. The MRI also encourages participation by way of student exchange
programmes. Students are requested to check if their home university
is involved in exchange programmes with one of the MRI universities (Groningen,
Nijmegen, Twente, Utrecht).
The MRI can offer a few full fellowships, intended for students
with no possibility of funding in their home country and a few partial
fellowships, intended for students with limited funding. In some
cases the admission fee will be waived.

Housing
The MC activities will be spread over the four participating
universities. The MRI will help candidates to find suitable
housing accommodation near one of the participating universities. Usually one
day per week the student will travel to another
university. Travelling can take up to two and a half hours each way.

Application
Application is open to all those who are now in the final year of their
undergraduate studies in Mathematical Sciences or have started their graduate
studies. Women are especially encouraged to apply.
To apply one should complete (a copy of) the application form attached
to this folder and send it together with the following documents to Jean
Arthur:

# Curriculum vitae.
# Academic record: list  of
subjects/classes taken at the home university; subjects for degree examination;
photocopy of diploma (if available).
# At least one letter of recommendation from a member of the academic staff of
the home university.
# A summary of the applicant's financial circumstances (if a fellowship is
being applied for).
N.B.:
incomplete applications will not be considered;
clearly indicate the topic of your choice;
there are no special application forms for fellowships or housing.
