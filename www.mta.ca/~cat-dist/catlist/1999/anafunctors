Some weeks ago, Max Kelly brought to my attention his paper "Complete
functors in homology I. Chain maps and endomorphisms", Proc. Cambridge
Phil. Soc. 60 (1964), pp. 721-735. In section 2, "Generalities on
functors", in the first two (full) paragraphs on page 723, he gives a
definition of what I call "anafunctor" in my paper "Avoiding the axiom
of choice in general category theory" (relatively) recently announced
on the Net. He gives both definitions, the elementary one, and the one
in the style of spans that I give in my paper. He introduces the
concept (that he does not name) as the general form of the data which
one is having at one's disposal in many situations when one wants to
introduce a functor but the converting of the data into a functor
requires a use of the axiom of choice. He does not attempt to develop
a theory of such data; however, he does say: "one who will not admit
such choices [requiring the axiom of choice] may work with the pair of
honest functors  S , T  [in the span-style definition of "anafunctor"]
in place of the dishonest functor ...".

Thus, my paper is a working-out of a thirty-year old idea of Max
Kelly's. In the paper, I endeavor to show that one can indeed "work
with the pair  S , T " without giving up the basic structure of
category theory.

What is the locus classicus for "anafunctors"?  As far as I know,
an anafunctor F: C -> D is a presheaf on C x D^{op} such that
F(c,.) is representable for any object c of C.  Is this how it's
normally defined?  Where is composition of anafunctors discussed?
Are there other names for these things?

John Baez asked, on January 24, about anafunctors. As far as I know, the
notion was first explicitly introduced in my paper "Avoiding the axiom of
choice in general category theory", in JPAA 108 (1996), 109-173. The term
was suggested by Dusko Pavlovic. Precursors occur in the work of Max
Kelly, and Andre Joyal, as I explain in the paper. The concept John gives
is equivalent to "saturated anafunctor" in the paper; plain anafunctor is
something that generalizes "functor". The wording of the definition of
"saturated anafunctor" is different from John's definition, but the
equivalence is fairly straightforward. I should mention that John`s
definition is a very useful formulation, especially when one wants to
generalize things to higher dimensional categories, as I came to realize
some time after I started studying the John Baez/James Dolan announcement
on weak n-categories.

In addition to the paper mentioned above, there is reference to
anafunctors in "First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts", a monograph that
will appear in Springer's Lecture Notes in Logic as soon as I manage to
complete the necessary revisions; it is available electronically from the
TRIPLES and HYPATIA (?) sites.
