The title says it all: I'm searching for references of papers which study
bimodules as generalized machines with product, composition and feedback. I
know of a series of papers by Bainbridge in the seventies, and I've been
(vaguely) told about the existence of something written by Bill Lawvere
about this. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!
