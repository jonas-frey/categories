Subject: e-prints 

Date: Wed, 3 Dec 1997 10:45:08 -0500 (EST)
From: James Stasheff <jds@math.upenn.edu>

Dear colleagues,
I'm writing to you about a proposed e-print archive in category theory,
on behalf of a committee of mathematicians which is advocating
the unification of various electronic preprint servers and archives into a single 
system with a common format.  We want to invite Category Theorists to join this
group. 

This invitation is being issued to 15 preprint servers (listed below) which
together cover about half of the subject areas in mathematics.  We are 
also trying to organize active groups in the remaining subject areas, so
that the unified preprint server will soon cover all of mathematics.  This
organizational effort has already produced interested groups in
combinatorics and geometric topology.

Managing a preprint server can be a time-consuming task, but fortunately
there is a similar preprint server in operation in physics, running at Los
Alamos National Lab and funded by the National Science Foundation, whose
staff is willing to take on the operation of a unified mathematics server.
This will enable all of us to take advantage of their years of software
development, as well as their efficient staff who monitor the (fully
automated) operation.  When scientific questions arise (such as the
suitability of a particular paper for a particular archive), these staff
members would consult with a designated "moderator" for each subject
area.  (The moderator also receives abstracts of papers as they are 
submitted, and can have the staff intervene in the rare instances of 
inappropriate papers or other difficulties.)  Someone you designate 
collectively would serve in this capacity under the new system.

The great advantage of a unified server is that all mathematicians will be
able to participate in electronic preprint exchanges in a single, flexible
system (which can distribute preprints in a variety of formats, including
dvi, ps and pdf).  The computer systems staff in a mathematics department
can be asked to familiarize themselves with this system, which will be easy
to support for users.  Moreover, a central location for preprints (with
dozens of mirror sites worldwide) together with a soon-to-be-familiar
scheme for citing these preprints will mean that mathematicians in one
field who see a citation to a preprint in another field will easily be able
to locate it.  We will also all gain the ability to simultaneously search 
through related archives, including full text searches. There is a common 
keyword index for the mathematical holdings, permitting simultaneous searching 
of all or designated related archives. A given paper could easily be relevant 
to users of more than one archive, so this would make information much easier 
to track.

In order to take advantage of the system in place at Los Alamos Lab, we
have agreed to follow the technical decisions they have made: authors
are asked to submit tex source files, for example.  Although this may be a
change for users of your current system, we believe that the long-term
advantages of unification outweigh the temporary disadvantages to users of
an established archive.

We propose to copy the contents of your archive (in its current form) into
the unified archive, and suggest that you encourage all future submissions
be made directly to the unified archive.  Category theory is one of the 
subject areas in the unified archive  and is intended as a continuation of your 
archive.  It should be fairly easy to
construct a kind of front-end on a web page at your site which will provide
access to both old and new papers in your portion of the unified archive,
giving your users a certain degree of continuity and allowing them to
retain the feeling of belonging to a smaller community of users of a
particular preprint archive.  We will be happy to assist in the
construction of such front-ends.  A primitive prototype for such a front-end
(in the area of combinatorics) can be viewed at http://eprints.math.duke.edu/archive/CO/
All but one of the links on that page take you directly into the archive at
Los Alamos.

A front-end for the entire unified archive is under construction at
U.C. Davis by Greg Kuperberg:  you can view it at
   http://front.math.ucdavis.edu
You might also like to look at the Los Alamos Math Archive itself (partially
functioning already), at
   http://xxx.lanl.gov/form/math
You will see that the combinatorics and geometric topology sections are
getting a good start this week.  At the time of unification (probably
Jan. 1) the four current math archives alg-geom, dg-ga, funct-an and q-alg
at the Los Alamos site will be merged into the unified archive, becoming
subject areas AG, DG, part of FA, and QA, respectively.

Our committee has had Joe Christie, Greg Kuperberg, Dave Morrison, Dick
Palais, Jim Stasheff and Mark Steinberger as its active participants, with
occasional participation by a few others.  If you are interested in having
a representative of category theory joining
this committee, we would love to have one.  Our tasks after this
unification will be developing the remaining subject areas, and publicizing
this archive among mathematicians.

	Short of that, as individuals, all you need to do right now
is write back and say you think the category theory category is a good idea,
or better yet, to pledge some number of e-prints to be submitted soon
after the category starts. Those already archived other than on your
own server should be offered with a copy of the offer going to the
archive administrator.  Of course we are most eager to have your present
and future e-prints added to the unified server.  (For e-print versions
of papers for which you no longer have the copyright, permission from the 
copyright holder will be needed.)

	I am very optimistic that this effort will eventually lead to a complete
transition to efficient electronic distribution of new results in
category theory.  The xxx archives has 3,000 math e-prints in the four
existing mathematics categories and 50,000 physics e-prints.  As you
might guess from these numbers, xxx has already effected the electronic
transition in several areas of physics.  The category theory category will
be of great benefit to us all.  Please help get it started; the more who join, 
the better.

  Best regards,

  	Jim Stasheff

I am all in favor of Jim Stasheff's proposal, but what does one do about
the fact that I, for example, have my own personal macros files and
my TeX files cannot be compiled without them.  If this is to be a
straitjacket, I would just as soon maintain our own server with dvi and
ps files.  I am also just a bit wary of distributing the tex source,
since it is so easily changed.  Not that dvi and ps files can't be
changed, but it is certainly a good deal harder.

Preprint servers of the sort Jim is describing have facilities for
uploading macro files, postscript files, etc. along with the TeX
files.   I use them a lot and they work.

But you don't need to.  You can also upload a bunch of
separate files using the uufiles program obtainable from 
the preprint archive.  It's painless and easy.

Information on this and a million other technical issues
is available at the archives themselves.  Try:

http://eprints.math.duke.edu/

or send email with subject header "help" to 

q-alg@eprints.math.duke.edu

> as for the plagarism issue, I will let the experts respond

I'm no expert, but I don't see what the problem is.  If you
upload your paper to one of these archives, the paper 
itself and the exact date and time it was first received is 
publicly accessible, so any attempt by anyone to plagiarize 
it would be incredibly easy to prove.  If you store your papers 
on your own site, it's much harder to prove you wrote them before 
someone else.  This is one reason why highly competitive
physicists rush to put their papers on the archives as
quickly as possible: to get a certified time stamp on their paper!

Anyway, I've never heard of any problems with plagiarism actually 
happening.

In case it's not been made sufficiently clear, the main
advantages of having all papers on a given subject stored
electronically at a single institution are:

1) they are easy to find
2) they are easy to refer to 
2) they stay there, archived, while the authors move from 
institution to institution and ultimately perish.  Will our 
institutions keep our websites going after we die, while 
technology continues to change?

Many of my papers (or pointers to them) appear on Ginsparg-style 
preprint archive, my own website, Hypatia, Mathematical Reviews, 
the category theory mailing list, and paper journals --- all of 
which serve different purposes.  Presumably some of these systems
will fall into disuse in a natural sort of way as time passes.  
I wouldn't advocate the brutal elimination of existing systems.
I think the question now is: would category theory be served by 
creation of a Ginsparg-style preprint archive for the subject?

Subject: unified electronic preprint archive for mathematics 

Date: Fri, 12 Dec 1997 18:56:40 GMT
From: Paul Taylor <pt@dcs.qmw.ac.uk>

An open letter to Jim Stasheff,
re the proposed unified electronic preprint archive for mathematics

Dear Jim,

Last week you published a proposal for a unified electronic preprint
archive in mathematics, at
	http://xxx.lanl.gov/list/math/info
making use of the software at Los Alamos National Laboratory which
was written by Paul Ginsparg, originally for a certain branch of Physics.
Following our extensive semi-private correspondence on this subject,
I think it is time for me to write something to the "categories" list.

First, I want to commend the efforts of yourself and your committee
in taking the initiative to call for a unified archive. Mathematics
is a notoriously parochial subject, and the existence of such a central
resource may in the long term help us to form The Big Picture.

Having said this about the mathematical issues, I am unhappy about
the way in which this proposal has been made in terms of management
and technical issues.  Such a unified archive will immediately acquire
considerable de facto authority, and it creates a monopoly over the
means of publication in mathematics which is potentially far more
significant than the contraints of the existing journal system from
which we are trying to free ourselves.  You have also accepted wholesale
Paul Ginsparg's design decisions, some of which may be accidents of
implementation.  In several respects there are or could be other
paradigms of electronic publishing, which ought to be encouraged to
co-exist with his ways of doing things, so that the community at large
can decide over a period of years which method is to be preferred.

I am worried that you may be making assumptions that things have to be
done in one way when in fact alternatives are possible.
In short, the proposal should have been "put out to tender" for other
software designs and implementations to compete on fair terms on the
basis of the facilities that they provide to authors and readers.

In these respects this issue is analogous to the debate about TeX macros
for commutative diagrams, on which a certain amount of blood was spilt
some years ago.  In that case someone who had used package X proposed
that there be an electronic journal in category theory in TeX source,
standarding on package X for commutative diagrams, without being aware
of the existence of packages Y, Z, ... Actually this is quite different:
in using TeX, or whatever technology they use for their papers, authors
are making a considerable commitment, and some of us have made a far greater
commitment by writing and maintaining macro packages.  In the case of
electronic dissemination (of existing files), papers can easily be copied
to and linked from many different places without any further effort
by the author.

Nevertheless, bad decisions at this stage about the database which says
where everything (and everybody) is could be significant handicaps in the
development of the technology at a later date.

I therefore beg you at least to stay the widespread advertising of the
new archive until its potential competitors have had a chance to
discuss the way in which they should co-operate and compete.

I intend to contact Paul Ginsparg myself to discuss some technical issues.
In particular I have a number of suggestions to make about the process
of registering authors and submitting papers. His collected bibliographical
data should be provided in BibTeX format for processing by other services.
It would also be possible to integrate his author registration with Hypatia's,
which would greatly enhance the usefulness of both systems.  In fact it is
remarkable how closely the strengths of one system coincide with the
shortcomings of the other.

Yours,
Paul Taylor

PS The technical discussion which I have been having with Jim Stasheff,
Bob Rosebrugh, Mike Barr and others has now moved to a new email list
run from Queen Mary and Westfield College.  Details of how to join this,
together with the archive of the discussion and other information, can
be found at
	http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/html/eprint.html

This message is followed by a separate one on the issue of submission
in TeX source form.


Date: Mon, 15 Dec 1997 14:18:23 -0400 (AST)
Subject: submission of papers in TeX source code 

Date: Fri, 12 Dec 1997 19:10:27 GMT
From: Paul Taylor <pt@dcs.qmw.ac.uk>

Following Jim Stasheff's announcement of a unified maths eprint archive
on the "categories" list, one issue which provoked a strong reaction
was the requirement that papers be submitted in TeX source form.

Mike Barr and others pointed out that they use versions of macro packages
which cannot reasonably be expected to work under automatic control or
in the hands of anyone apart from themselves.  I agree very strongly with
their views.

I claimed in a previous email that the main site at Los Alamos accepts
submissions in numerous formats but that the implementation at Duke
University, where several existing maths servers exist, restricts this to TeX.

I have spent most of today reading the documentation at xxx.lanl.gov
and it has given me a headache: electronic methods have a very long
way to go to compete with paper when it comes to reading the whole
of a lengthy technical document.

So, my claim was wrong.  Paul Ginsparg has very strong views in favour
of TeX (source):
        http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/faq/whytex.html
and against alternative formats such as PostScript.  I agree with a lot
of what he says,  and would even stick my neck out to suggest that
Mike Barr probably does too.  However, Mike and I feel very strongly
that being forced to submit TeX source is a straitjacket,  and you can
expect us to continue arguing this vigorously (and informedly).

Curiously, Paul Ginsparg doesn't discuss DVI (the output of (La)TeX) as
an archive format, this being the one for which I would argue.
TeX and PostScript are programming languages, but DVI is a very simple
and robust "byte code".  For anyone worried about the "doomsday scenario"
that TeX will no longer exist in 100 years time, the structure of DVI
is simple enough that it could be decyphered from existing binary files
and a viewer recreated.  After all, this was done for hieroglyphs
in the 19th century, without the aid of the very sophisicated hardware
and artificial intelligence techniques which we can expect to exist
in the future. 

Ginsparg's archives have been running since 1991 and (according to his
statistics) take a considerable volume of traffic.  From TeX source
he generates several other formats, configurably by the reader, apparently
on the fly.  To promise to do this and still keep your head above water
requires an extremely robust system, as I know from having run a major
TeX implementation for many years.  There is also a lot of documentation
about configuring your web browser to accept files in formats for which
Netscape was never designed.  In other words, he seems to have a very
professional way of delivering files to readers.  I take my hat off
to him, because this is a conspicuous weakness of Hypatia.

Whatever the arguments and counterarguments about this particular issue,
I suggest that a more liberal attitude to archive submission formats
be taken by this and other archives.

Paul Taylor

PS There was also some discussion of plagiarism, on which subject
        http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/nch/www/koala-info.html
is interesting.
