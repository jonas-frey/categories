Is there any graduate algebra text still in print that uses the language of
categories?  Mac Lane and Birkhoff, and Hungerford, both seem to be out of
print. (I deduced this from Macmillan's and Springer's webservers rather
than Books In Print).

Concerning Charles Wells' question, there is the following more recent graduate
text in Algebra which, at a fairly early stage, contains a reasonable chapter
on categories (including adjoint functors), but which does not necessarily
stress categorical methods and language lateron: "Algebra" by Mark Steinberger,
PWS Publishing Company, Boston 1994.

You can get MacLane and Birkhoff's graduate algebra book from

   Chelsea Publishing    (212) 889-8095

for only about $40.  It's excellent!

Lang's algebra is a good intro.
Actually, Grothendick's "On some questions of
homological algebra" is the best.
