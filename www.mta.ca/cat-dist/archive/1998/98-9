       limited to)
         1. Extensions of ``classical'' LPNMR languages by new logical
            connectives and new inference capabilities such as abduction,
            reasoning by cases, etc;
         2. Semantics of new and existing languages;
         3. Relationship between various formalisms;
         4. Complexity and expressive power;

Has anybody seen the following symmetric closed monoidal category?  Let
#A# be a category tripleable over Set.  Let #V# be the comma category
(F,#V#), F being the free functor.  So an object (S,s,A) is an arrow s:FS
--> A and a map (S,s,A) to (T,t,B) is a pair f: S --> T and g: A --> B
making the obvious square commute.  The closed structure (S,s,A) --o
(T,t,B) is a certain arrow of the form (Hom((S,s,A),(T,t,B),?,B^S).  The
monoidal structure is fairly ugly, but it exists. 

Of course, an object (S,s,A) can also be thought of as an S-tuple of
elements of A, by adjointness.

Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca
Precedence: bulk

Having been out of email contact since late June, what with travels and
hospitals, I have only now read the correspondence in early July on this
subject. I note that the only "co" in the Macquarie dictionary is that
coming from Latin "cum', of which the "co" in "cosine" is a special case,
in that it is short for "complement".

I don't recall ever knowing the origin of "colimit" and so on, but I can
report an interesting observation by Sammy Eilenberg (in private conversation,
when we were collaborating) on why projective limits are "limits" and 
inductive limits are "colimits", and not the reverse. His point was that
L is a limit in the category A iff, for each a in A, the set A(a,L) is a 
limit in Set; while C is a colimit in A iff, for each a in A, the set A(C,a)
is a limit in Set - not a colimit. So one needs limits in Set even to DEFINE
colimits in A. If you like, God made limits, while colimits are Menschenwerk.

As for "cofinal", where the "co" was originally of the "cum" type, meaning
that the subsequence was "equally final" with the whole sequence, and which
was "confinal" in German, we of the Sydney school - very likely at the same
time as others - saw it as hopelessly confusing in view of the categorical
use of "co", and deliberately changed it to "final" in our writings, with
"initial" for the dual. Note that the notion of a final functor works
beautifully even for WEIGHTED limits, as in my book on enriched categories.

	Hello,

	I am looking for papers which interpret
	the conceptual framework (Stability, 
	Simplicity..) of Shelah's Classification
	theory in purely categorical terminology.

	In spite of a remark (page 58, Accessible
	Categories: Makkai and Pare/ Cont maths 104)

	`one of the chief aims of clasification
	theory as pursued by S.Shelah is to 
	answer a purely categorical inquiry
	about completely elemntary categories.'

	I have not been able to find further
	information about this aspect.

	I will be grateful for any pointers.

				Sincerely,
				P.S.Subramanian,
				Tata Institute.

 I don't know of anything treating this directly, but you may have a look at:

"Accessible categories, saturation and categoricity"

INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CURRENT TRENDS IN APPLIED FORMAL METHODS


           Boppard, Germany, 7-9 October, 1998

            http://www.dfki.de/vse/fm-trends


This workshop focuses on key technologies that broaden the application
of formal methods in an industrial setting. Rather than addressing special 
topics in an isolated way it is intended to embrace the various aspects of 
this emerging new technology comprehensively with respect to its industrial
applications.

The workshop is split into an ``academic'' part (2 days)
and an application part (1 day). For the academic part we obtained more
than 30 submissions from which we selected 15 papers for presentation.
Egon Boerger, Manfred Broy, and Ed Clarke will be the invited speakers 
for the various sessions. The application day is dedicated 
solely to current and future applications of formal methods. Technical
sections will cover the main application areas, like hardware verification, 
embedding systems, and security.

To registrate to the workshop or to get detailed information please contact

Dear all, 

If D is any category equipped with a "cohomotopy structure" (P,p0,p1,s) where 
P:D->D is a functor and p_0,p_1:P->Id_D and s:Id_D->P are natural transformations 
of functors such that p_0s=p_1s=Id_D, we get cubical sets by the following way :

we set P^0=Id_D, P^{n+1}=P(P^n) and 

d^\delta_{i,n} = P^{i-1}p_\delta P^{n-i}:P^n-->P{n-1}, i=1,...,n, \delta=0,1
s_{i,n} = P^{i-1}s P^{n+1-i}:P^n-->P^{n-1}, i=1,...,n+1

and (D(X,P^n(Y)),d^\delta_{i,n},s_{i,n})_n is a cubical set for any object X and Y 
of D.

[I am using the notations of the paper "Homotopies of small categories", Marek 
Golasinski, Fund.Math. 114 (1981) no 3, 209-217]


Now, take D = omega-Cat, I^1 the 1-cube {a -u-> b} and for P the following functor 
: if C is an omega-category and 2_n the omega-category representing C|->C_n, we set 

P(C) = Hom^l(I^1,C) (the left internal hom : take the right one if you want)

with p_0 and p_1 induced by 2_0 ==> I^1 (==> means 2 arrows) which send the point 
of 2_0 on a (resp. b) of I^1 and s : I^1 -> 2_0 which sends a and b on the point of 
2_0 and the 1-morphism of I^1 on the degenerated 1-morphism. 

So (P,p_0,p_1,s) is a cohomotopy structure on omega-Cat. 


=> (omega-Cat(X,P^n(C)),d^\delta_{i,n},s_{i,n}) for any omega-category X.

With X=2_0, omega-Cat(X,P^n(C))=omega-Cat(I^n,C), and (I think) we get the 
classical cubical nerve. We have to verify that the face and degeneracy maps are 
the same in both cases (for the underlying set, it is trivial). I am looking for a 
simple ("abstract") argument in order to aviod an explicit computation. Thank you 
for any help.

Mike Barr asked whether anyone had been aware that the comma category
	(F,A)  or equivalently  (S,U)
is symmetric monoidal closed, where
	    A
          ^    |
         F| -| |U
          |    V
            S
is a monoidal (tripleable) adjunction over S=Set.

As he said,  an object (S,s,A) is an arrow s:FS--> A 
(or, by adjointness, an S-tuple of elements of A) and
a map (S,s,A) to (T,t,B) is a pair f: S --> T and g: A --> B
making the obvious square commute.

He said that the closed structure (S,s,A) --o (T,t,B)
is a certain arrow of the form (Hom((S,s,A),(T,t,B),?,B^S).

I have certainly seen comma categories like (S,U); they are referred to
as gluing, sconing or the Freyd cover.  (BTW Peter says that "scone" is
a corruption of Sierpinski cone, so its correct pronunciation is presumably
"shco:ne".)  This construction provides an almost magical proof of
strong normalisation, consistency and similar results for various
fragments of symbolic or categorical logic. The algebraic theory that
I have in mind here for Mike's monadic adjunction is that which describes
the fragment of logic in question (the Australians would prefer us to 
talk about a 2-monad here).

An early example of such a proof in the unification of these two
traditions was given by Yves Lafont in an appendix to his thesis.
He proved that the embedding of a category in the free CCC that it generates
is full and faithful.  In the course of this he described the exponential
in (S,U), which is what Mike's formula gives, though I didn't notice
(and apparently nor did Yves) that the A-object which we have is the
internal version of Mike's Hom-set.

Yves Lafont's result appears as part of a generic account of the gluing
construction in Section 7.7 of my forthcoming book.

Dear friends: has anyone in CT-land been thinking about cryptography?
I'm looking for a structuralists' spin to the now classical approaches,
primarily relating to public key cryptosystems as initiated by [DH'76],
which complements the standard number theory approach [K'94].
In [D'88] Diffie suggests that abstractions which have proven to be useful
in addressing many other classical problems will also be needed in crypto.
Of course!
The classical central problem is to find suitable "one-way" functions or
algorithms: easy in one direction but "hard" in the other. Factoring is one
example, as well as discrete logs in finite fields and groups of elliptic
curves where the arithmetic is computationally difficult. A delightful
survey (translated from German) is given in the little MAA monograph [B'94]
by Beutelspacher, worth reading for its enjoyment alone.
Provably secure cryptosystems do exist; this occurs when there is an iso
between messages and random keys, although "truly random" is still
problematic. However, these are not practical in general, and are not used
commercially. Consequently, in trying to break cryptosystems, most
approaches to the crypanalysis are analytic, focusing on digital
computation. However I have this feeling that an "analogue" approach may be
fruitful. After all, one of the most successful attacks to date is DPA
(differential power analysis) [NYT'98] which is essentially an analogue or
non-computational method of extracting keys and other information. But in
addition to physical engineering methods, there may other logical analogue
approaches such as quantum computing that might be useful, and arise
categorically.
The property that small changes in a message should result in large changes
in the cryptogram may suggest some application of chaotic or non-linear
dynamical systems. This has indeed been tried, but again on a mechanical
rather than structural level.
It feels like time should be fundamental (temporal thinking?) since that
seems to provide the uniqueness to distinguish messages. However, this
should also involve a deeper understanding of variation (perhaps via time
sheaves) which might provide superior approaches in terms of thinking about
crypto problems.
An indication that crypto may be interesting to categorists is that
protocols could be viewed in game theoretic terms, the latter having already
been considered structurally. Furthermore, perhaps all attack scenarios can
be formulated in game theoretic terms, hence also defense strategies.
Another inspiration (at least to me) is induced by the nice treatment given
by Steve Vickers to the example of bit strings as topological systems that
threads through [V'89]. After all, 2-star-omega is the crypto base space.
As a final inducement, it is worth noting that there is real money in this
stuff. Commercial applications of crypto have great value in this security
conscious information society of ours.

Your thoughts would be most welcome, but no flames please. ... Al Vilcius
(retread algebraist).

Related to Mike and Paul's messages to categories, I had the
following observation in my recent draft paper 
(http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~hassei/papers/basic.ps.gz
 "Logical predicates for intuitionistic linear logic", Lemma A.1): 

	Suppose that C and D are symmetric monoidal closed
	categories and that G:C->D is a symmetric monoidal
	functor. Moreover suppose that D has pullbacks.
	Then the comma category (D,G) can be given a symmetric
	monoidal closed structure, so that the obvious projection
	(D,G)->C is strict symmetric monoidal closed.  

I used this (together with the free symmetric monoidal cocompletion) 
for deriving "logical predicates (logical relations)" for
intuitionistic linear type theories, thus in a similar way as Lafont's 
use of glueing for typed lambda calculi and ccc. In this paper I also
have another lemma for glueing symmetric monoidal adjunctions, for
interpreting the modality !.

I have been wondering if this is a sort of folklore, but never found a 
reference. 

Best Regards,

Masahito.

We have apparently had some kind of break-in on triples using the ftp

we have disabled anonymous ftp.  I am now trying to find out if the

In any case, if there is something you need, please write and ask the

Later on, we will decide what to do.  One possibility is to password
protect it and announce the password on this list.  This will protect us

This concerns the discussion by Mike Barr, Paul Taylor, and Masahito
Hasegawa regarding symmetric monoidal closed comma categories:
	The construction (later called 'comma') in the category of
categories was introduced in 1963 primarily for foundational
simplification (though it was clear that certain particular cases, such as
slice, were already in direct use).  Besides the 2-categorical equational
description of adjointness, one needs the description in terms of a
bijection between arrows, but that does not require the complicated
assumption that there exists a category of sets in which two given
categories can be enriched.  Namely, an adjunction between two given
categories can be described by giving a third 'adjunction category',
related by appropriate functors to them, which is isomorphic to two
differently-constructed 'comma' categories.  It seems that there are many
cases in which this third category is of interest in itself, whether or
not one of the two given categories is or is not monadic or comonadic over
the other.
	Emilio Faro's notes from my Fall 1990 Buffalo course Categories of
Space and of Quantity, mention essentially the result cited by Masahito
Hasegawa.  If an adjunction involves monoidal functors, then the
adjunction category tends to be a monoidal closed category.  This remark
was essentially intended to supply semantically-based examples of closed
categories which have one aspect which is linear (in the straightforward
sense that coproducts equal products) and an opposite aspect which is
cartesian (in the sense that the tensor is the categorical product).  Of
course, the most immediate subclass of examples, based on the data of a
rig in a cartesian closed category, involve monadic adjunctions.  On the
other hand, several published papers on related matters axiomatically
assume comonadic adjunctions.
	However, the simple algebraic stance, as Masahito Hasegawa points
out, is that both aspects, as well as the relation between them, are all
regarded as equally given.  As part of the logic (= natural structure) of
the resulting situation there will be unary (= modal?) operators reflected
on each aspect  by composing.  A further step is to investigate to what
extent the data can be approximated via data which is reconstructed on the
basis of only one aspect or the other using this additional reflected
structure.  Both that step a la M. Stone, as well as the simple algebraic
stance in the spirit of Chu and G. Mackey, are of course involved in the
full study of any related pair of aspects (e.g. algebra and geometry).
	A problem from topology, where related considerations may help,
concerns the operation of collapsing a connected subspace to a point (the
effect of this operation on relative homology is part of the content of
algebraic topology).  In extending this operation to apply to
not-necessarily-connected subspaces (and more generally, from inclusion
maps to arbitrary maps), collapsing all these to a point would be an
unnecessarily discontinuous functor.  Rather, within the category whose
objects are continuous maps, consider the subcategory wherein the domains
of these structural maps are discrete (or zero-dimensional, if that is
different in the model of continuity being considered).  That subcategory
is reflective (with the help of pushout) in case the model admits a left
adjoint connected-components functor.  In the case of a subspace, the
reflector collapses each of its components to a distinct point in the new
ambient space, and the lifted unit of the adjunction is epimorphic if the
original one (to the connected components pi zero) is, even where the
subspace is empty.  I am wondering:  under what conditions are these
categories and functors cartesian monoidal closed? 
	Indeed these things are probably folklore, but listed
below are some references containing partial indications.

I did not go into details on the problems we had, but so many have written
to me offering diagnoses incompatible with the facts that I figure it is
easier to describe them once and for all.  There were two symptoms.  First
triples essentially stalled for minutes at a time.  More seriously, the
computer centre made a formal complaint that triples was generating so
much traffic that it was seriously compromising the internet connection.
Since McGill is the gateway to all of Quebec, this is serious business.
There was an implicit threat to cut the department off if we didn't do
something about it.  I suppose then the department could have cut triples
off, although it never went that far, since I first tried changing the
root password in case whoever it was was changing the logs.  This had no
effect and the logs left little doubt that the only oddity was the ftp
signons which showed simultaneous (maybe 8-10) from the same origin and
that not identifiable by nslookup.  (This last fact is not, in itself
suspicious; the machine I am now using gets a new IP address whenever it
is booted and cannot be identified by nslookup.)  But the machine that
does this is different every time.  So it cannot be explained by,
according to one suggestion, some newbie getting confused and copying the
same thing many times.  In fact, it is hard to know how you could copy
enough to fill the while I-net channel.  At any rate, closing the ftp
access seems to have cured it.  We are mulling over what to do.  Some
think that putting a password will inhibit non-category theorists that do
not subscribe to the list.  And I guess it would compromise Hypatia.  But
I think Vaughan mirrors triples anyway.

Recently there have been some security problems with the Montreal
Category Group's ftp site on triples.  This seems a good opportunity
to remind people that our old "ftp-based" URLs have been updated for
WWW use.  In particularly, the "official" URL for the group's WWW page
is (and has been for a while now)

      http://triples.math.mcgill.ca

(note the absence of the redundant "www" prefix)

Related URLs that are linked to this include the recent call for
papers for the Lambek Festschrift (deadline 31 Jan 1999)

     http://triples.math.mcgill.ca/lambek/LambekVol.html

as well as the current seminars of the group, and the table of
contents for the upcoming special issue of JPAA in honour of Mike Barr
("Barrfest").

     http://triples.math.mcgill.ca/barrfest/bfpapers.html

(and other links of interest...)

The last time a note such as this went out, we promised to support the
"old" urls for a time - that time may be running out now, so we
encourage all interested to verify that your links and bookmarks are
up-to-date in this regard.  For the time being, any ftp to triples may
be unreliable, until the security issues are resolved.

One more comment on that fascinating ugly monoidal structure. Many
years ago D. Pataraia as a student was asked to realise tensor product of
vector spaces (V and W over k) as a colimit. He then came up with a
diagram (sorry for still more ugly notation)

                                 k_{v,w}
                                 /    \
                                /      \
                              |_        _|
                            V_w          W_v

That is, vertices of the diagram consist of U(W) copies of V, U(V) copies
of W, and U(V)xU(W) copies of k (U is the forgetful functor to sets). And
the maps... well, you guess.

The reason this is relevant is that in the Barr's monoidal category, the
product of (S->U(A)) and (T->U(B)) is (SxT->U(C)) where C is the colimit,
in the category of algebras, of

                                 F(1)_{s,t}
                                 /    \
                                /      \
                              |_        _|
                            A_t          B_s

It does not look so ugly after all, does it?

Mamuka

A Note on Reduced Categories

Zhaohua Luo

Abstract:

In this note we introduce the notion of a reduced object for any
category A with a strict initial object 0. A pair of parallel maps f, g:
X --> Z is called "disjointed" if its kernel is the initial map to X. It
is called "nilpotent" if any map t: T --> X such that (tf,  tg) is
disjointed is initial. An object X is called "reduced" if any pair of
distinct parallel maps with domain X is not nilpotent. A category A is
called "reduced" if any object is reduced. One can show that any epic
quotient of a reduced object is reduced. A class D of objects of A is
called "uni-dense" if any non-initial object is the codomain of a map
with a non-initial object in D as domain. We show that any uni-dense
class D of a reduced category A is a set of generators. Other properties
and criterions of reduced categories are also studied.

{\bf Publication:}
Papers accepted by the Program Committee must be presented at the conference
and {\bf will appear in a proceedings volume}, to be published by Springer
Verlag in the ``Lecture Notes in Computer Science'' series. The second
refereeing round which was requested in previous CSL editions before
accepting a paper for publication in the proceedings, has been
suppressed following the decision taken by the EACSL membership
meeting held during CSL'98 (Brno, Czech Republic, August 25th 1998).
Final versions of accepted papers will be due by {\bf July 12, 1999}.
The format for camera-ready manuscripts will be that of Springer LNCS;
instructions can be found in the LNCS home page at
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html.

\noindent
{\bf Important Remark:}
The proceedings volume will be available at the conference.
In order to enable this, the deadlines for paper submission and
notification of acceptance have been slightly modified w.r.t.
the announcement made in the 1st call for papers.
