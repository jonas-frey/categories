"Topological representation of the lambda-calculus"

S. Awodey

Abstract: The lambda-calculus can be represented  topologically by
assigning certain spaces to the types and certain  continuous maps to the
terms.  Using a recent result from topos theory, the usual calculus of
lambda-conversion is shown to be  deductively complete with respect to such
topological
semantics.  It is also shown to be functionally complete, in  the sense
that there is always a ``minimal'' topological model, in  which every
continuous function is lambda-definable.  These  results subsume earlier
ones using cartesian closed categories, as  well as those employing
so-called Henkin and Kripke lambda-models.

                        LAST CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS


                            CADE-15 Workshop on

                   PROOF SEARCH IN TYPE-THEORETIC LANGUAGES

                               Lindau, Germany
                                 July 5, 1998


EXTENDED DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION: May 18, 1998


A one day workshop on "Proof Search in Type-Theoretic Languages"
will be held the 5th July 1998 in conjunction with the 15th Conference
in Automated DEduction (CADE-15, Lindau, Germany).
Attendance is by invitation only: authors of accepted submissions
will be invited. Hardcopies of the preliminary proceedings will be
distributed at the workshop. Proceedings will be published (depending
on the number of high-quality papers) as a volume in Electronic Notes
in Theoretical Computer Science, Elsevier Science Publishers.


TOPICS

Much recent work has been devoted to type theory and its applications
to proof and program development in various logical frameworks.
This workshop focuses on proof search in type-theoretic languages and
their underlying logics(e.g., classical, intuitionistic, linear
logics). Such languages are logical frameworks for representing
proofs and in some cases formalize connections between proofs and
programs that support program synthesis.

The objective of the workshop is to provide an integrated forum for
the presentation of  research and the exchange of ideas and
experiences in proof search in type-theoretic languages and related
logics or logical frameworks.

Topics of interest, in this context, include (but are not restricted
to):

- foundations and semantics of proof search,
- methods, techniques and concepts related to proof construction,
- logic programming as search-based computation, integration of
  model-theoretic semantics,
- proof synthesis vs program synthesis,
- applications,
- equational theories and rewriting,
- decision procedures, complexity results,
- environments for formal proof development.

SUBMISSIONS

Researchers interested in presenting their works are invited to send an
extended abstract (8-10 pages)} by e-mail submissions of Postscript
files to the Program Chair (Didier.Galmiche@loria.fr) before May 14,
1998. Researchers interested in attending the workshop (without giving
a presentation) should send a position paper (1-2 pages) presenting
their interest.
Papers will be reviewed by peers, typically members of the program
committee.
Additional information will be available through WWW address:
http://www.loria.fr/~galmiche/cade15-wpsttl.html

Dear Colleagues,

Since this is the categories list, I could and should have been more
specific about the contents of the preprint I announced yesterday:
"Topological representation of the lambda-calculus", available from my page
on the WWW,

http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/

In a nut-shell, the point is that the Butz-Moerdijk spatial covering
theorem for topoi can be used to embed any CCC fully and faithfully (and
CC) into a topos of sheaves on a space.  So the "topological semantics"
mentioned are actually in such topoi of sheaves.

Steve A.

     Dear Category Theorists,

     I am currently studying a paper on logic and the author employs
category theory in his work. However, he is using
"multicategories" which is something I hear for the first time.
Unfortunately my knowledge of CT isn't that deep and so
if someone could suggest me papers/books that provide
a definition of this term, I would be really grateful to him/her!

Yours Sincerely,

A. S.

       The 68th Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic
                       August 29-30, 1998 
                      Brno, Czech Republic



   The 68th meeting of the PSSL will be held at the Masaryk
University, Brno, Czech Republic over the weekend of 29-30
August 1998. It is organized in connection with the federated
conferences MFCS (Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science)
and CSL (Computer Science Logic) which are taking place in Brno
during August 23-28, 1998. There are other workshops related to
MFCS\CSL and participants interested to stay in Brno the whole
week may contact Jan Staudek.
   As usual, the 68th meeting of the PSSL will be informal in
nature and it will be focused on category theory, logic and
theoretical computer science.
   We have arranged an accommodation in a student dormitory
(single rooms, for 2 nights since Friday to Sunday) together with
breakfasts and lunches in a university restaurant. The cost is 80$ 
for those who will register till June 25th and 120$ for others. 
Participants wishing to stay in hotels should contact Jan Staudek.
   Brno is located about 200 km south-east of Prague and 130 km
north of Vienna and it can be reached from the both airports by
trains and buses. More details will be available in the second
announcement. We will maintain a www-page containing all
informations.
   The registrations for PSSL 68 are handled electronically via web,
on http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/staudek/mfcs/, or via e-mail.
To use the web, all you have to do is to carefully fill out the 
form located there using Netscape 2.0 / Explorer 3.0 or later (with 
Java Script enabled). 
   To register via e-mail, please fill out the form below and return it
(preferably by e-mail) to Jan Staudek (staudek@fi.muni.cz). We would be 
pleased if you could register till June 25th.
   Looking forward to meeting you in Brno.

	***********************************
	* Functional = Imperative + Shape *
	***********************************

FISh is a new array programming language that combines (and extends)
the
	       EXPRESSIVE POWER 

of functional programming with the 

	      EFFICIENT EXECUTION 

of imperative, or procedural, programming by performing

	     STATIC SHAPE ANALYSIS

on all programs. This shape computation reduces higher-order
functional programs to simple imperative forms, i.e. F - Sh = I.
Conversely, FISh works best when functions are constructed from
imperative procedures and shape functions, as recommended by the
slogan that gives the language its name.

	         F = I + Sh

FISh execution speeds on typical array problems are SEVERAL TIMES
FASTER than other higher-order, polymorphic languages.

This announcement, research papers, reference material and the
implementation are all available from

     http://linus.socs.uts.edu.au/~cbj/FISh/announcement.html

The main themes are introduced in the paragraphs below.

	***********************************



Expressive Power 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FISh supports 

- the usual functional features

such as strong typing, higher-order functions and parametric
polymorphism. It also supports 

 - simple imperative features 

such as assignment, for- and while-loops, and local variables, using a
type of commands. Procedures are represented as functions into
commands, as in Algol-like languages. 

Unlike existing Algol-like languages, it also supports data types of
arrays, so that array programs may be polymorphic in the size of the
array. Now this has been extended to
support

 - poly-dimensional array programming.

If a is any array type then [a] is the type of all arrays with entries
in a that are

 - finite dimensional, and 
 - regular, 

such as vectors, matrices, three-dimensional arrays, etc. Thus,
poly-dimensional array programs can be written that act on a vector,
matrix, or higher-dimensional array. For example, the standard prelude
supports a polymorphic constant

              map : (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b] 

which will map a function over a vector, matrix, or higher-dimensional
array. Note that a matrix of integers, or type [int] has a different
type from a vector of vectors of type [[int]]. Thus, given 
sum_int : [int] -> int which adds up an array of integers, we have

             map sum_int : [[int]] -> [int]

which will sum each entry of the outer array. This is useful when 

 - representing complex numbers as arrays of length 2, or
 - each entry in an array has an associated array of data, e.g.
      - each entry is given an array of nearest neighbours, or
 - decomposing an array into an array of blocks, e.g. 
      - a matrix into a matrix of matrices.

Static Shape Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shape analysis is used to determine the number of dimensions, and the
size in each dimension, of every array appearing in a program. (A
program is a closed term of array or command type.) In particular, it
checks that every array is regular, i.e. is a hyper-cube whose
entries all have the same shape. The latter requirement is necessary
to ensure that every entry in a vector of vectors has the same length,
i.e. that a vector of vectors is a matrix. As well as detecting
irregularities, it is able to detect all other shape errors, such as
multiplying matrices of innapropriate sizes, or having incompatible
numbers of dimensions. It is the power of shape analysis that makes
poly-dimensional programming feasible.

Knowledge of the shapes can be used to improve memory management
during compilation of the resulting imperative program. In particular,
FISh supports a clear stack discipline, and so does not require a
garbage collector. The existing FISh compiler translates programs in
to simple C code, which is then compiled and executed in the usual
way. This approach is also being applied in the design and
implementation of a parallel version of FISh, called GoldFISh.


F = I + Sh
~~~~~~~~~~

The slogan is represented within the standard prelude by a function

     proc2fun : (var a -> var b -> comm) -> (#b -> #a) -> b -> a 

for converting procedures (and shapes) to functions. proc2fun pr sh x
uses the shape function sh and the shape #x of the array x to
determine the shape of the result. It then creates a local variable y
of this shape, and invokes the procedure pr on and a stored value of
x, finally returning the value of y.


Semantics
~~~~~~~~~

Shape analysis is supported by a clean and powerful categorical
semantics, in which the shape-data (or shape-entry) decomposition is
represented by a pullback. For multi-dimensional arrays, this is

                                    entries	 
                      	       [a] ---------> List a
                                |   |           |
                                |___|           |
                          shape |               | map #
                                |               |
                               \/               \/ 
                           List N x #a -----> List #a 
                                         c

where c takes the list of numbers ns and the a-shape sh and produces a
list of length given by the product of ns whose entries are all sh.
In other words, all entries of an array must have the same shape.


Poly-dimensionality 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FISh supports the usual Hindley-Milner style of polymorphism. It also
supports polymorphism in array sizes (unlike earlier Algol-like
languages) and in the number of dimensions of an array. That is, FISh
supports polydimensional programming. For example, the map function
is defined to have type

                             map : (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]


and so may act on a vector, matrix or higher-dimensional
array. However, the existence of the simple imperative features means
that this can be compiled into a sequence of nested for-loops
corresponding to the number of dimensions of the array argument. 
Polydimensionality is a form of *shape polymorphism*. 


Array Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Poly-dimensionality means that many array programs, e.g. numerical
recipes, can be written for any number of dimensions while maintaining
static type and shape checking. For example, FISh supports
poly-dimensional stencilling and a poly-dimensional difference
equation solver (see Sample Programs).


Parallel Programming 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Size and shape are important parameters in estimating the cost of
alternative parallel implementations. FISh has been designed to
support a parallel variant, called GoldFISh, currently under
development. GoldFISh will support additional parallel combinators for
some of the existing FISh functions that express the usual
second-order constants and also the usual array distributions (see
Sample Programs).

A(n attempt of a) systematic exposition of the basics of a 

        Fibrational Theory of Geometric Morphisms

based essentially on the work of B'enabou, Moens et. al. can be found in the
diploma thesis of my student Peter Lietz under the www-address

   http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/ags/ag14/mitglieder/lietz-de.html

A new aspect seems to be that Moens' characterisation of geometricity of a
fibration is essentially extensivity of the fibred category albeit w.r.t.
internal sums.

Hi -

who coined the expression
   General Abstract Nonsense
as a synonym for category theory? 
Where did it first appear in print?

Thanks for any comments.

Dear categorician (or categorist, I do not know the word in English),


I posted the following question some days ago in sci.math.research.
Maybe this list is more appropirated : 

I would need to understand a proof of the following proposition :  

There is only one functor up to isomorphism TENS : omega-Cat x
omega-Cat -> omega-Cat for which C TENS - and - TENS C have right
adjoint for every omega-category C and which satisfies I^p TENS I^q =
I^{p+q} where I^p is the omega-category canonically associated to the
p-cube, (using for example the set of composable sub pasting schemes
of the pasting scheme associated to the p-cube). 

I have a paper from Crans ("Pasting schemes for the monoidal biclosed
structure on omega-Cat") which proves explicitely the proposition. I
do not understand the construction, which is very technical (*). Is there
a less complicated way to prove this proposition ? I do not need an
explicit construction.   

Any help is welcome.

pg.


(*) What is a pasting presentation for example ? I know the definition
of pasting scheme, realization of pasting schemes, but I do not know the
one of "pasting presentation". Another question : if f, g are morphisms
in C and h, k morphisms in D, is there in C TENS D elements corresponding
to f TENS h and g TENS k, and if the answer is yes, is it true that 
(f TENS h) o_p (g TENS k) = (f o_p g) TENS (h o_p k) ? I suppose that
it is false : if it should be true, why the construction of this monoidal
structure is so complicated ?

Aim:
 Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer science,
 and the construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated
 in many different frameworks. The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum
 for researchers to present their results to those members of the computer
 science community who study or apply the fixed point operation in the
 different fields and formalisms.


Topics:
 Construction and reasoning about properties of fixed points, categorical,
 metric and ordered fixed point models, continuous algebras, relation
 algebras, fixed points in process algebras and process calculi, regular
 algebra of finitary and infinitary languages, formal power series, tree
 automata and tree languages, infinite trees, the mu-calculus and other
 programming logics, fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits,
 fixed points and the lambda calculus.

 Preliminary proceedings containing the abstracts of the talks will be
 available at the meeting. Publication of final proceedings as a special issue
 of Theoretical Informatics and Applications depends on the number and quality
 of the papers.


The workshop will be organised at the same place as the federated
MFCS'98/CSL'98 conference and care will be taken that participants of the
workshop can attend invited talks of the MFCS and CSL conferences.

No special registration fee is required for participants who also
register for MFCS'98 or CSL'98 and have a presentation at the workshop. Other
workshop participants registered for MFCS'98 or CSL'98 will be requested to
pay a small fee for the preliminary proceedings. Registration only for the
workshop is also possible--expenses for fee, accommodation, and basic
meals are very modest. Registration information can be found 
on the MFCS web page at http://www.fi.muni.cz/mfcs98.

Aim:
 Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer science,
 and the construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated
 in many different frameworks. The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum
 for researchers to present their results to those members of the computer
 science community who study or apply the fixed point operation in the
 different fields and formalisms.


Topics:
 Construction and reasoning about properties of fixed points, categorical,
 metric and ordered fixed point models, continuous algebras, relation
 algebras, fixed points in process algebras and process calculi, regular
 algebra of finitary and infinitary languages, formal power series, tree
 automata and tree languages, infinite trees, the mu-calculus and other
 programming logics, fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits,
 fixed points and the lambda calculus.


Invited lectures:

 A. Arnold (Bordeaux): Boolean mu-calculus and its relations
                       with model-checking and games
 
 J. W. de Bakker (Amsterdam): Fixed points in metric semantics
 
 Y. N. Moschovakis (Los Angeles/Athens): Fair, non-deterministic
                      recursion in higher types (tentative)

This is interesting if indeed it was due to Steenrod.  In that case, it
was certainly not intended as a putdown (as Lang clearly intended it).
Sammy Eilenberg told on a number of occasions the story that when General
Theory of Natural Equivalences was published, Steenrod said that no paper
had ever influenced his thinking more.  He had been searching for years
for an axiomatization of homology theory, but had never thought of using
the induced homomorphisms as the basic tool.  The result was, of course,
the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms.  (The rest of the story is that P.A. Smith
said he never read a more trivial paper in his life.  Sammy commented that
both reactions were valid.)

It might be amusing for people to see the full context as I replied to
Bodo: 


Serge Lang used it in his Addiison-Wesley  text: " Algebra" in the
first(?) 1965 edition. On page 105 after the chapter on Homology, the
following appears:


 "EXERCISES: Take any book on homological algebra, and prove all the
theorems without looking at the proofs given in that book. Homological
algebra was invented by Eilenberg-Mac Lane. General category theory
(i.e. the theory of arrow-theoretic results ) is generally known as
<italic>abstract nonsense</italic> ( the terminology is due to
Steenrod)."

A pasting presentation for an omega-category is similar to a presentation
for a group, but taking into account that there are cells of different
dimensions. In particular, generators in dimension n are ``labeled''
n-dimensional pasting schemes with the labeling involving generators
*and relations* in lower dimensions. More details about pasting presentations
can be found in my paper "Pasting presentations for omega-categories", which
is available via my web-page: http://www.mpce.mq.edu.au/~scrans/papers/
or via hypatia: http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/author/C/CransSE/.

The proposition above follows by general categorical methods, using the
adjunction between omega-categories and cubical sets. Apart from my proof
cited above there are earlier proofs by Al-Agl and Steiner [Nerves of
multiple categories, Proc. London Math. Soc. (3) 66 (1993) 92-128] and
by Brown and Higgins [Tensor products and homotopies for omega-groupoids
and crossed complexes] (who only do omega-groupoids but their proof holds
for omega-categories as well).

Yes, there are elements in C TENS D corresponding to f TENS h and g TENS k.
But is not just that (f TENS h) o_p (g TENS k) = (f o_p g) TENS (h o_p k)
is not true: it does not even make sense, because the sources and targets
don't match up.

A quote from a Colin McLarty posting on another list:

"        Norman Steenrod first hung this tag on category theory.
He had spent years trying to axiomatize homology, encouraged by
Solomon Lefschetz. Lefschetz had also backed the young topologist
Sammy Eilenberg, and encouraged Eilenberg's collaboration with the
algebraist Mac Lane explicating certain calculations in homology. 
When Eilenberg and Mac Lane created category theory, Steenrod saw 
he could use their way of emphasizing morphisms at least as 
much as objects. He happily said this "abstract nonsense"
was the key to solving his problem.

        The phrase was popularized by Lang's ALGEBRA, which
had an index entry under "abstract nonsense". The page numbers
sent you to various one line proofs such as "By abstract 
nonsense, tensor products are unique up to isomorphism when
they exist". The joke got old and survives only vestigially in
the latest edition."

A month or so ago, I got a note from Ross Street asking about my 1986
JPAA paper on representations of categories.  The main point of that
paper was to give a new, relatively simple proof of the full embedding
theorem for regular categories.  Unfortunately, I tried to get too
general and got tangled in the variance, so that the argument could not
be followed.  Follows is my final note to Ross.  The argument is really
quite simple and can be described as follows:

1. Show that when @C (read script C) is regular, so is Lex(@C,Set)\op.
 (Lex=FL is the finite limit preserving functors.  This result is really
the only new thing in the paper.)

2. Adapt Grothendieck's transfinite induction proof of the existence of
injectives in an AB5 abelian category to show that Lex(@C,Set)\op has
enough @C-projectives = regular functors.

3. Adapt Mitchell's proof of the abelian category full embedding theorem
to show that by taking a sufficiently large full subcategory @P in
Lex(@C,Set) consisting of regular functors, then the evaluation functor
@C --> Func(@P\op,Set) is full and faithful.

That's all there is to it.  I plan to post on triples in the next few
days a revised version of the paper (it was, fortunately, one of the
very first that was typed on a computer, so this is not too onerous).  I
will call it embedding.rev.

Ross further raised the question as to whether a transfinite induction
was too sophisticated for the classroom.  I don't know exactly what
level his course was, but I will say that if we never do a hard theorem,
then the students will come away with the idea that there is no depth to
category theory, an impression his colleagues will be only too happy to
affirm.  This argument of Grothendieck's is, after all, the first
example that there could be deep results in categories.

=====================================================================

Dear Ross:

I did not really try to understand my paper.  I suspect it is a matter
of trying to be too abstract and getting tangled in my own feet.  At any
rate, here is how I would do it for a class.  First, since you didn't
ask, I assume that you are happy with the fact that given a small
category @C (think of that as script C; BTW, I never noticed how
dreadful JPAA's scripts were), the category @L = Lex(@C,Set)\op has the
property that given any functor F, there is a regular epi P -->> F such
that P is projective with respect to regular epis in @C.  Now consider a
small full subcategory @P built out of choosing @C projective covers for
each representable and a @C-projective cover for the kernel pair of each
of the @C-projective covers of representables.  Thus, for each object C,
there is a parallel pair Q ===> P in @P, whose coequalizer in @L is C.
Notice that Hom_{@L}(P,C) = PC, using Yoneda and taking the variance
into account.

There is an obvious functor F: @C --> Fun(@P\op,Set) that takes C to
the functor P |--> Hom(P,C) = PC.  This functor is clearly
faithful, preserves finite limits and regular epis.  The only question
is the fullness.  So suppose a: FC --> FB is a natural transformation.
What naturality means is that for any d: Q --> P in @P, the square
                         Hom(d,C)
               Hom(P,C) ----------> Hom(Q,C)
                  |                    |
                  |                    |
               aP |                    | aQ
                  |                    |
                  |                    |
                  v                    v
               Hom(P,B) ----------> Hom(Q,B)
                         Hom(d,B)
 commutes.  Applied to an f: P --> C, this means that aQ(d.f) = d.aP(f).
Apply this in the case that f is a coequalizer in @L to a parallel pair
d,e : Q ===> P in @P.  It says that
     aP(f).d = aQ(f.d) = aQ(f.e) = aQ(f).e
 and that means that there is a unique b: C --> B such that aP(f) = b.f.
You finish the argument by observing that for any object R of @P and any
c: R --> C, there is a lifting to an arrow g: R --> P and then aR(c) =
aR(f.g) = aP(f).g = b.f.g = b.c.

The proof Michael Barr had in mind at the time of writing his 1986 JPAA
paper on representations of categories, and has now clarified, is truly
beautiful.  I may have misrepresented what the problem was with presenting
the transfinite induction part of the proof in my course.  It is a question
of time rather than difficulty.  I am not known amongst my colleagues as
one who shrinks from teaching or avoiding hard proofs.  The point is that I
have a course consisting of 24 lectures to a group including a (bright) 4th
year student (who had hardly heard of categories before the course), a
graduate students in number theory, physics and computer science, my own 5
PhD students, and a professional category theorist.  I am trying to keep it
interesting for all. The students (even the ones who have done a formal
set-theory course) have not really used ordinals; so I would need to
sacrifice some category theory to provide that background. I am still
undecided about this; perhaps, the transfinite induction and the embedding
theorem can be an appendix to the course.

Perhaps the most novel aspect of the course, considering my 2-cell
background, is that I have given 18 lectures so far without introducing
natural transformations. I'm about to talk about adjunctions without them
too.

I must admit that the course content has evolved on the run. But looking
back, I think it has some unity of purpose.  I headed straight for the
definition of regular category as having a terminal object, pullbacks,
strong epi - monic factorizations, and stability of strong epis under
pulling back along arbitrary arrows.  We developed the method of
generalised elements and constructed the Poset-enriched category of
relations in a regular category.  We proved relations with right adjoints
are graphs of arrows.  We proved strong epis are regular. Equivalence
relations and (Barr-)exact categories were examined.

[One of my (intended?) questions to Michael Barr was whether he knew of a
diagram lemma which could be proved significantly quicker using the
embedding theorem than by the generalised-element/relations technology.]

I proved in detail that an exact additive category is abelian (as defined
in Freyd's book "Abelian Categories" - beginning of Chapter 2). Not only is
that a deep theorem of category theory (in my opinion - despite not needing
a transfinite argument) but it is a microcosm of categorical ideas that
have proved useful in other contexts.  We proved the Five Lemma, Snake
Lemma using relations in the abelian category.

So far I have set 15 exercises: some quite challenging. One was to prove
Cat is not regular (I gave a bit of a hint).

Now I am discussing 2-sided discrete fibrations (just for categories) in
depth.  These are being advertised as the "relations" of category theory.
In fact, this means we do have presheaf categories disguised as  DFib(A,1);
so some natural transformations are there hiding there.

I have this weekend to decide where we go next!

But I think there is enough meat in all this to deal with sceptical colleagues.

When it comes to a game of "my subject's harder than yours, nya, nya", I
would also argue that the concepts category theory has to offer are just as
hard to really master as difficult theorems.  This is why many
mathematicians calculate hard to do what we can do with our concepts.

Ross

I certainly welcome Ross' clarification of his problem.  One possibility
would be to give the proof except for the existence of sufficient regular
functors and either refer the students to the paper or (better) write it
out carefully and distribute it.  One thing I have given only a little
thought to is whether it can be done using a maximal principle argument.
The point is that it is not a question of extending a map to a larger and
larger subobject, but of building larger and larger objects and not as
subobjects of something already given.  This makes it different from the
proof, say, that divisible abelian groups are injective (from which the
existence of sufficient injectives in any module category follows easily).
I think a maximal principle argument goes down a lot more easily than one
based overtly on ordinals or transfinite induction.

Ross, it sounds like a beautiful course and if you have notes, I would
like to see them.

Practical Foundations of Mathematics,   ISBN 0-521-63107-6 

To be published by Cambridge University Press, as number 59 in their series
Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics (which includes books by Peter
Johnstone and by Jim Lambek and Phil Scott). 

Please see http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/book/index.html for details.

This is the LAST CALL FOR COMMENTS.

The text is already in the hands of the copy editor for the second time.
CUP hopes to have it published in time for the International Congress
of Mathematicians in Berlin in August, which means I have to finish it
by the end of May.

I am aware that my policy of only giving away single chapters has annoyed
people a bit, but it has been successful in its objective of getting
attention for the whole book.  (The most assiduous reader of "Proofs
and Types" got to chapter 12 out of 15).  I don't intend to distribute
any more chapters now, though if I owe you a copy of the whole draft
because you sent me comments on a chapter, please ask (tearing apart
sections 1.1 and 1.2 does not count).

If you have a copy of part of the book and have noticed a mis-conception,
please SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE.   There is really no point
in telling me about missing commas in any but the most recent versions
(ie 1998) as other readers, the copy editor and I have been through
the text several times since I last distributed copies (in July 1997).

When I am rid of the book itself, I intend to set up a web site as a
repository for citations, discussion, answers to exercises  and,
inevitably, corrections.  With the permission of the people concerned,
I intend to publish some of the correspondence I have had about the book
in this way, and there will be automatic facilities for readers to add
further comments. Therefore any comments you have about the book which
are too late for publication or which are not suitable for inclusion
will not be wasted.

I would like thank Pierre Ageron, Lars Birkedal, Luca Cattani,
Michel Chaudron, Thierry Coquand, Robert Dawson, Luis Dominguez,
Peter Dybjer, Susan Eisenbach, Fabio Gadducci, Gillian Hill, Martin Hyland,
Samin Ishtiaq, Achim Jung, Stefan Kahrs, J\"urgen Koslowski, Steve Lack,
Jim Lambek, Charles Matthews, Paddy Mccrudden, James Molony,
Edmund Robinson, Pino Rosolini, Martin Sadler, Alan Sexton,

Ross Street asks Michael Barr if he knows "of a diagram lemma
which could be proved significantly quicker using the embedding 
theorem than by the generalized-element/relations technology".
Well, I don't exactly, but one of the earliest uses of Barr's
embeddings of regular categories was in my American Journal of
Mathematics paper on Simplicial Homotopy in an Exact Category 
(1977, vol 99, pp 1193-1204). I wanted to prove the homotopy 
exact sequence of a Kan fibration of sheaves of simplicial sets
and Barr's results were exactly what I needed. All this has 
since been improved by using closed model structures and a less
naive definition of fibration, but the "embedding/technology" 
Ross mentions was all we had available--in sufficient generality
to cover my situation--at the time.

On pages 29--30 of "Categories for the Working 
Mathematician,"  MacLane reveals that "the discovery of
ideas as general as [categories, functors and natural
transformations] is chiefly the willingness to make a
brash or speculative abstraction, in this case supported
by the pleasure of purloining words from the philosophers:
`Category' from Aristotle and Kant, `Functor' from Carnap
and `natural transformation' from then current informal 
parlance."

Ideas from writings of Karl Marx are described in
"Conceptual Mathematics:  A First Introduction to Category
Theory,"  by Lawvere and Schanuel and elsewhere.


What orientation or program of study has philosophy given 
the investigation of mathematical categories?

Where could one begin reading to understand this influence?

Was selection of "monad" influenced by writings of Leibniz?


Thank you for your time.

                    25th International Colloquium
                      on Automata, Languages,
                          and Programming


Aalborg, Denmark                                  July 13-17, 1998


                  http://www.cs.auc.dk/icalp98/

The International Colloquium on  Automata, Languages, and  Programming
(ICALP) is the  annual conference series  of  the European Association
for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS).  It is intended to cover all
important areas of theoretical computer science.

During 5 conference days  and  two weekends,  ICALP will give  you the
opportunity  to choose between 70  regular papers, 9 invited lectures,
including  the Gödel award lecture, and  4  thematic workshops and one
associated summer school offering dozens of more talks!

Due to a recent General Strike in Denmark the ICALP booklet has been
delayed. Therefore we extend the deadline for early registration to

                             JUNE 1st

The final deadline for registration is still June 12.

Upon numerous requests student may  now register at  a special low fee
(DKK 1200  before  June 1 and  DKK  1400 after).   The  fee will cover
conference attendance, refreshments and lunches only.  Proceedings and
banquet tickets can be purchased separately  on arrival.  Students who
have already registered  at the regular  fee may choose on arrival  to
receive a refund.

The  full  programme and registration  form  are  available at the web
address above  and from   the   organizers (just  send  a  message  to
icalp98@cs.auc.dk or a fax to +45 98159889).

Would the following (aside from the first) help to prepare a more
digestible proof of Barr's full regular embedding theorem?

1) Say that an object U of a (but not just any) category E is open if U
   is a finitely presentable object of the opposite of E (i.e., if it
   satisfies the analogue of the filter convergence characterization
   of open sets). An object P of E is strict if it is the projective
   limit of a diagram of opens such that each limit projection is an
   effective epimorphism; P is called saturated if for every U -->> V
   of opens, each P -->> V lifts to some P -->> U; finally, P is called
   weakly projective if it is projective with respect to effective
   epimorphisms of opens. Every strict, saturated object is  weakly
   projective.   
2) Given P in Pro(C), where C is a regular category, let P' denote the
   fibred product of all X -->> P which are opens of Pro(C)/P, and P*
   the projective limit of: P <<-- P' <<-- P'' <<-- P''' ...; one
   shows that the projection P* --> P is an effective epimoprhism, that 
   P* is a strict, saturated object of Pro(C)/P, and therefore that P*
   is a weakly projective object of Pro(C). Theorem 14 of Barr's '86
   JPAA paper (i.e., step three in his message of 21 May) applies.
3) The construction is (to my knowledge) due to Joyal (c. 1972, or
   earlier). Objects of the form X*, where X is an object of C, are 
   principal prime models, a notion Makkai (Full continuous embeddings
   of toposes, Trans AMS, 1982) distilled from Barr's original proof
   (Joyal called them absolutely flasque). 
cheers,

PS:Without the terminology, that Pro(C) (=~ Lex(C,Set)^op) is regular 
   if C is is suggested in SGA4, Expose I, 8.9 (especially cf. exercise
   8.9.9(b)).

Well, I am not trying to be snide, but for me, my argument is more
understandable.  But if you prefer to see it in the way you put it, I have
no objection.  A couple more comments.

In 1986 (or, really, 1984), I did not really understand that this argument
was *really* the same argument, just dressed up nicer, using functors
instead of diagrams.  

In 1970, I was fresh from homological algebra.  The construction struck me
(and still does) as reminiscent of the argument you use in showing that if
you have the beginnings of a map from a projective complex to an acyclic
one, you can continue it one more step.  The main difference was that this
was a well-founded poset instead of an inter-indexed chain.  And if anyone
ever wondered why I called these A diagrams and P diagrams, it had nothing
to do with A&P and everything to do with acyclic and projective.  Thus the
embedding theorem is, like many other things I have done, a form of
acyclic models.

Hello!

I'm trying to get information about Ehresmann & Vanbremeersch theory of
"Evolutive systems with memory". This is a theory for modelling complex
evolutive systems using category theory. I've got a couple of papers
(from 1989 to 1992), but I would like to find a synthtic article which
could present the matter more consistently...

Does anybody know if there is such a thing, or at least whom I could
ask?

Thank you for any help,
