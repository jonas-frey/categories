We, Peter O'Hearn and David Pym, are pleased to announce
our new paper, ``The Logic of Bunched Implications''.

We hope it will be of interest to readers of `categories'.  BI
is a relevant logic which extends both linear and intuitionistic
logic. It has a semantics of proofs based on `doubly closed categories',

which carry two monoidal closed structures, one of which is cartesian
in models of BI. A rich class of models is provided by Day's tensor
product construction on  the category of presheaves over a small
monoidal category. It also comes with a lambda calculus, a truth
semantics
and a computational interpretation as a logic of resources, quite
different from
that of linear logic.

The paper is available at:

        http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pym
and
        http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~ohearn

where drafts of various companion and related papers can/will be
found.

Abstract.

Introduce a logic BI in which a multiplicative (or linear)
and an additive (or intuitionistic) implication live side by
side. The propositional version of BI arises from an analysis
of the proof-theoretic relationship between conjunction and
implication, and may be viewed as a merging of intuitionistic
logic and multiplicative, intuitionistic linear logic. The
predicate version of BI includes, in addition to standard
additive quantifiers, multiplicative (or intensional)
quantifiers ``forall-new'' and ``exist-new'' which arise from
observing restrictions on structural rules on the level of terms
as well as propositions. We discuss computational interpretations,
based on sharing, at both the propositional and predicate levels.

The following short paper is available from my home page:

	http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mhe/pub/papers/top97.ps.gz
or
        http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mhe/papers.html

(It is an updated version of a paper which was previously circulated
in other lists.)

		=====================================
		Injective spaces via the filter monad
======================================================================
An injective space is a topological space with a strong extension
property for continuous maps with values on it. A certain filter space
construction embeds every T_0 topological space into an injective
space.  The construction gives rise to a monad. We show that the monad
is of the Kock-Zoberlein type and apply this to obtain a simple proof
of the fact that the algebras are the continuous lattices (Alan Day,
1975, Oswald Wyler, 1976).  In previous work we established an
injectivity theorem for monads of this type, which characterizes the
injective objects over a certain class of embeddings as the
algebras. For the filter monad, the class turns out to consist
precisely of the subspace embeddings.  We thus obtain as a corollary
that the injective spaces over subspace embeddings are the continuous
lattices endowed with the Scott topology (Dana Scott, 1972).  Similar
results are obtained for continuous Scott domains, which are
characterized as the injective spaces over dense subspace embeddings,
via the proper filter monad.
======================================================================
Two notes (and some questions concerning credit)
=========

(i) Bob Flagg and I have also considered the following variations on
the filter monad (a report is being written)

  (a) Category: T_0 exponentiable spaces 
          (= core-compact = open sets form a continuous lattice)

      Restriction on filters: Scott open.

      => Associated maps: "semi-proper" embeddings
          (= right adjoint of the frame maps preserve directed joins)

      => Algebras (and hence injectives over semi-proper):
          continuous meet-semilattices with Scott topology. 

      (Corollary: continuous meet-semilattices and Scott continuous
       functions form a CCC. Was this known before?)

      This characterization of the algebras was previously known
      (Andrea Shalk--anyone else?), but the "KZ-method" outlined 
      in the above abstract gives a much shorter proof.

  (b) Category: T_0 spaces 

      Restriction on filters: prime.

      => Associated maps: flat embeddings
          (= right adjoint of the frame maps preserve finite joins)

      => Algebras (and hence injectives over flat):
          compact, stably locally compact spaces. 

      (A localic version is given via the ideal monad. What Johnstone
       refers to as Joyal's Lemma appears as a special case of this.)

      (I don't know what was previously known about this.)

      (A result by Isbell (in his paper "Flat = prosupersplit")
      implies that the flat embeddings form the largest class of 
      embeddings over which the CSLCSs are injective, because
      finite spaces are (trivially) CSLCSs.)

  (c) Category: T_0 spaces 

      Restriction on filters: completely prime.

      => Associated maps: "completely flat" embeddings
          (= right adjoint of the frame maps preserve all joins)

      => Algebras (and hence injectives over completely flat):
          sober spaces. 

  (d) Category: T_0 locally connected spaces  

      Restriction on filters: filters of connected open sets.

      => Associated maps: "locally dense" embeddings
          (= frame maps preserve connectedness (and hence right 
           adjoints preserve disjoint unions))

      => Algebras (and hence injectives over locally dense):
          L-domains. 

      (This was obtained by Bob, based on some previous work by
       Paul Taylor (and Andrea Shalk) on the algebras. Again, the 
       KZ-method gives a simpler proof of the characterization.)

(ii) The filter monad is formally analogous to the so-called
continuation monad, as it is observed (with the formal details of the
analogy) in the paper being advertised.

I would like to also mention that the general injectivity result for
KZ-monads referred to in the above abstract was established in the
paper

        http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mhe/pub/papers/injective.ps.gz

which is (mainly) about continuity of the extension process (answering
a question by Scott in his 1972 paper on continuous lattices).

Comments are wellcome.

One correspondent writes:

for example, there's only one paper per year classified as "Category  
Theory" (currently there's only math.CT/9805102), then we conclude that
either
a) no papers suitable for that classification are being written, 
b) the people writing those papers are unaware of the archive, 
c) they're aware of it but prefer not or are too busy to use it, or 
d) they're actively boycotting it.

I'm hoping that c) is the reason and not d). Listing with 
xxx.lanl.gov in noway precludes or detracts from the use of e.g. hypatia

		Announcement and Call for Papers

		          MFPS XV

                  Fifteenth Conference on the
                  Mathematical Foundations of
                     Programming Semantics 

                       Tulane University
                      New Orleans, LA USA
                    April 28 - May 1, 1999

       Partially Supported by the US Office of Naval Research


The Fifteenth Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics will take place on the campus of Tulane
University in New Orleans, LA from April 28 to May 1, 1999.  The MFPS
conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic and
computer science which are related to the semantics of programming
languages.  The series particularly has stressed providing a forum
where both mathematicians and computer scientists can meet and
exchange ideas about problems of common interest. We also encourage
participation by researchers in neighboring areas, since we strive to
maintain breadth in the scope of the series.

The invited speakers for MFPS XV include:

      Martin Abadi (DEC Research Center)
      Matthew Hennessy (Sussex)
      Tom Henzinger (Cal Berkeley)
      Uday Reddy* (Illinois)
      Peter Selinger (Michigan)

*: To be confirmed

In addition to the invited talks, there will be two special
sessions. One will be on security, and is being organized by Martin
Abadi, Catherine Meadows (NRL) and Dennis Volpano (Naval Postgraduate
School). The second session will be on Object-Oriented
Programming. The remainder of the program will consist of papers
selected from submissions we receive in response to this Call for
Papers.

The Organizing Committee for MFPS consists of Stephen Brookes (CMU),
Michael Main (Colorado), Austin Melton (Kent State University),
Michael Mislove (Tulane) and David Schmidt (Kansas State). The
Co-chairs for MFPS XV are Stephen Brookes and Michael Mislove.

The Program Committee Co-chairs for the meeting are Andre Scedrov
(Penn) and Achim Jung (Birmingham).  The Program Committee also
includes:

    Stephen Brookes (CMU)
    Adriana Compagnoni (Stevens Institute)
    Kathleen Fisher (AT&T)
    Paul Gastin (LIAFA)
    Andrew Gordon (Microsoft Research)
    Reinhold Heckmann (Saarbruecken)
    Catherine Meadows (NRL)
    Michael Mislove (Tulane)
    Peter O'Hearn (Queen Mary and Westfield)
    Catuscia Palamidessi (Penn State)
    Prakash Panangaden (McGill)
    Dusko Pavlovic (Kestrel)
    Andrew Pitts (Cambridge)
    A. W. Roscoe (Oxford)
    Giuseppe Rosolini (Genoa)
    Jan Rutten (CWI)
    Eugene Stark (Stony Brook)

Submissions must be extended abstracts of 12 pages or less.  They
should be in the form of a PostScript file that can print on any
PostScript printer. In particular, submissions should use the US
letter size format, as opposed to the European A4 size.

Submissions either can be sent by email to mfps@math.tulane.edu or
they can be deposited by anonymous ftp in the directory pub/incoming
on the machine 129.81.96.30.  In the latter case, a message also
should be sent to mfps@math.tulane.edu advising us of the
submission.

         The Deadline for Submissions is November 3, 1998.

Information about decisions will be available shortly after January 1,
1999, at which time a list of accepted papers will be posted.

As with MFPS XI and MFPS XIII, the Proceedings of the conference will
be published as a volume of the Electronic Notes in Theoretical
Computer Science. For information about this series, access the URL
http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs.

General inquiries about MFPS XV can be addressed to
mfps@math.tulane.edu.

In addition to supporting the conference overall, the support provided
by the Office of Naval Research makes funds available to help offset
expenses of graduate students.  Women and minorities also are
encouraged to inquire about possible support to attend the meeting.

               Registration Information

Detailed information about registration and accommodations will be
available shortly after January 1, 1999. Participants should be
prepared to make travel arrangements for the meeting as soon as
information is available; the timing of the meeting will overlap the
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and it is anticipated
that securing travel into and out of New Orleans at this particular
time will be difficult if arrangements are not made as early as
possible.

                 More Information

Updates to the information about MFPS XV can be accessed at the home
page for the meeting, http://www.math.tulane.edu/mfps15.html.
Inquiries about the meeting can be addressed to mfps@math.tulane.edu.

           Centre de Recherche en Theorie des Categories
                 -- Montreal --
            Category Theory Research Center

 Postdoctoral Fellowship in Category Theory

The Categories Team at McGill and at the University of Ottawa has had an
unexpected resignation and invites applications for Postdoctoral
Fellowship.  The salary is CA$30,000, and it might possbily be
supplemented by a part-time teaching post at McGill.  It is a one year
limited term appointment, with a possible second year.  There is in
principle, no nationality restriction, but the successful candidate will
have to go through Canadian and Quebec immigration procedures.  In the
case of a non-North-American resident, this will entail difficulties
that would probably delay taking up the fellowship till the beginning of
next (calendar) year.

Interested candidates should apply, with a CV and a statement of plans,
as soon as possible and should ask for letters from three referees.
Candidates interested in teaching should also provide evidence of
teaching experience as well as English proficiency if that is not their
native language.  Owing to the lateness, electronic applications and
references are much preferred, but if an application comes in by paper
in the next couple of weeks it will be accepted.

The members of the Categories Team are:  M. Barr (McGill), R. Blute
(Ottawa), M. Bunge (McGill), T. Fox (Vanier Col.), J. Lambek
(McGill), M. Makkai (McGill), A. Sangalli (Champlain Col.), P. Scott
(Ottawa), R. Seely (John Abbott Col.).

LAMBEK FESTSCHRIFT - CALL FOR PAPERS

The (electronic) journal "Theory and Applications of Categories" has
agreed to publish a special volume in honour of the work of our
colleague Joachim Lambek, in celebration of his 75th birthday,
which was marked by a symposium at McGill on his actual birthday last
December 5th, 1997.  We welcome submissions to this volume from anyone
interested. All papers submitted will undergo the usual TAC referee
process, and we are hopeful that the final volume will be ready before
summer 1999.  (For the TAC home page, see <http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/>).

Topics suitable for the volume include any of the subjects to which
Jim Lambek has contributed which fall roughly within the scope of TAC.
For example, categorical algebra, categorical logic and proof theory,
mathematical linguistics, algebra and ring theory (preferably with
some categorical application or methodology), categorical computer
science, etc.

We would like to note that a companion volume is also being prepared
by the journal "Mathematical Structures in Computer Science" - there
may still be room for a very small number of short-to-moderate-length
papers to be included in that volume. If you wish your submission to
be considered for that, please indicate this when you submit your
paper to us.  (Of course, MSCS's emphasis is more towards computer
science).

The submission deadline for the Lambek Fest volume is 30 January,
1999.  Please send a postscript file (uuencoded and compressed, if
possible) to rags@math.mcgill.ca, or 3 paper copies to

 R.A.G. Seely             
 Department of Mathematics
 McGill University

(If possible) please send an email message to rags@math.mcgill.ca
indicating the title (and authors, if other than the sender of the
email) of the paper, as well as an abstract (in standard ascii format,
maximum 1 page) of the paper.  

A technical point: TAC can only accept files prepared with some
"flavour" of TeX or LaTeX - most authors ought to be able to arrange for
such a file to be prepared from their paper, but if you have problems,
let us know and we shall see if we can provide helpful advice.  General
advice for preparation of papers, including suitable macros, may be
found at the TAC home page, <http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/>.
