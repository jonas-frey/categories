WORKSHOPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Workshops provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to meet and
discuss focused issues in an atmosphere that encourages interaction,
exchange, and problem solving. A workshop should have a well-defined theme,
and a clearly-defined target audience. All topics related to object-oriented
technology are potential candidates for workshops. In particular, workshop
proposals fall into three categories:
* Workshops focusing on a topic in depth. Examples include object-oriented
analysis and design methods, object-oriented languages, e.g. Eiffel, etc.
* Workshops crossing borders of sub-areas in computer science and/or
software engineering. Examples are management and teaching issues.
* Workshops addressing the industrial application of object-oriented
technology in particular areas, e.g. telecommunications, mobile computing or
real-time systems.

The subject says it all.  In general, you should ALWAYS use the address
barr@math.mcgill.ca since I can adjust that for the viccissitudes of
computerdom.

What is happening is that someone is getting into it and sending out gobs
of material, enough to generate official complaints from downstream
computers and the CC here has turned it off.  This happened last summer
and we assumed it was ftp, but now we have turned that off, as most of you
know.  To make matters worse, our technician is a student.  We moved the
computer to the computer centre last summer because our offices had no air
conditioning and the CC absolutely will not permit students to enter for
any reason whatever.  I guess we will have to take it out.

The preprint: On Branched Covers in Topos Theory

is available from my home page

http://www.math.ubc.ca/~funk/

in postscript or .dvi format.

This is a revision and extension of a preprint I had
posted from Cyprus in June, 98.

Abstract: We present some new findings concerning branched covers in
topos theory. Our discussion involves a particular subtopos of a given
topos that can be described as the smallest subtopos closed under small
coproducts in the including topos.
Our main result is a description of the covers of this subtopos as a 
category of fractions of branched covers, in the sense of R. Fox, of the
including topos.  We also have some new results concerning the general
theory of KZ-doctrines, such as the closure under composition of discrete
fibrations for a KZ-doctrine, in the sense of Bunge-Funk.

Subject: categories: Question of Tom Leinster of 26 Nov: one-object closed categories
Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca
Precedence: bulk
Status: O
X-Status: 


Tom observed that an abelian monoid is a symmetric monoidal closed
category with one object, and asked whether anyone had studied categories
enriched in such a closed category.

Eilenberg and I, in our long article [Closed categories, in Proc. Conf. on
Categorical Algebra (La Jolla, 1965), Springer-Verlag 1966, 421 - 562]
remarked in our "Examples" section (Ch.4, Section3, page 553) that these
are, to within isomorphism, the only one-object s.m.closed categories. The
odd thing is that we don't seem to have looked at V-categories for such a
V - perhaps we did not want to give trivial-looking examples, although we
gave other little examples such as Heyting algebras.

The use we made of such a V arising from an abelian monoid M was to give an
interesting but unusual example of a monoidal functor. We observed that a
monoidal functor f: V --> Ab was the same thing as an M-algebra, commutative
precisely when the monoidal functor f is symmetric.

Anyway, I had a brief look at V-categories for such a V tonight, but with
too few details so far to say much about them before bedtime. Queer little
creatures, aren't they? A V-category A has objects a, b. c. and so on, but
each A(a,b) is the unique object * of V. All the action takes place at the
level of j: I --> A(a,a) and M: A(b,c) o A(a,b) --> A(a,c). Sorry to use the
traditional M for composition, when it was the monoid. Let the monoid be G.
When G is an abelian group, the M and j seem to be determined by elements
N_a,b depending on two objects of A. There is more meat in a V-functor. I
look forward to working through this - as I suppose Tom has done - and
looking especially at the cases where G is a two-element monoid. The
underlying ordinary category A_o of the V-category A seems to be an odd beast.

While I don't remember ever working through this, it still rings a bell.
Somewhere I have seen arrows decorated with something like numbers (elements
of G ?). Ross Street and his colleagues at Macquarie often use the word
"suspension" for the process of seeing an abelian as a one-object monoidal
category, a monoidal category as a one-object bicategory, and such things -
I don't know the full definition of "suspension"; but they and numerous
others are well aware of, for instance, the tricategory with one object,
whose 1-cells are commutative rings, whose 2-cells are two-sided algebras,
whose 3-cells are bimodules, and whose 4-cells are bimodule-homomorphisms.
Clearly I got that wrong; I think the objects should have been the 
commutative rings. Anyway, people doing this work are very likely to have
seen and used such one-object V.

Still, it looks like fun; and I've never seen an exposition of V-Cat for
the case where G is the two-element group. I'm taking it to bed.

Max Kelly.

Since I asked the question I've found a few examples; they've all got
the same flavour about them, so I'll just do my favourite.

If V is the commutative monoid, then a V-enriched category is a set A plus
two functions
	[-,-,-]: A x A x A ---> V
	    [-]:         A ---> V
satisfying
	[a,c,d] + [a,b,c] = [a,b,d] + [b,c,d]
	  [a,a,b] + [a] = 0 = [a,b,b] + [b]
for all a, b, c, d. 

The example: let A be a subset of the plane. Choose a smooth path P(a,b) from
a to b for each (a,b) in A x A, and define [a,b,c] to be the signed area
bounded by the loop
	P(a,b) then P(b,c) then (P(a,c) run backwards);
also define [a] to be 
	-(area bounded by P(a,a)). 
(There's meant to be an orientation on the plane, so that areas can be
negative.)  Then the equations say obvious things about area - don't think
I'm up to that kind of ASCII art, though.

Tom

A few remarks: In the case where V is an abelian group, the first
axiom already implies the other two if we define [a] = -[a,a,a].
Namely, by letting a=b in the first axiom, it follows that [a,a,c] is
independent of c.

If V is an abelian group, then one can get an example of the above
structure from an arbitrary map {-,-} : A x A ---> V by letting
[a,b,c] = {a,b}+{b,c}-{a,c} and [a] = -{a,a}. Tom's "area" example is
of this form.

In fact, if V is an abelian group, then *any* example of a V-enriched
category is (non-uniquely) of the form described in the previous
paragraph: Fix some x in A (if any), and define {a,b} = [a,b,x].

What about the non-group case? In general, [a,b,c] need not always be
invertible in V. In fact, [a,b,a] need not be invertible. For a simple
example of this, let V be the natural numbers and define

 [a]     = 0,
 [a,b,c] = 0, if a=b or b=c,
           1, if a,b,c pairwise distinct,
           2, otherwise (i.e., if a=c but a,b distinct).

This indeed works.

Concerning categories enriched in monoidal categories with a single
object: another example is given by cocycles. It can be presented in
various ways. For example, a "\v Cech style" version: given an open cover
of X by Ui and a (suitably normalized) \v Cech 3-cocycle c of this cover
with values in M, this enrichs in the evident way the category whose
objects are the i's, with hom(i,j) either a singleton or empty according
to inhabitedness of the intersection of Ui and Uj. Other variations
suggest things like morphisms of simplicial sets to the nerve of M
considered as a 2-category with a single 1-cell. This is related to
K(M,2)-torsors, etc. Quite probably there are several publications
exploiting this. At least cocycles with values in monoids rather than
groups certainly have been considered. 

What I certainly have not seen is a backwards generalization: has anybody
considered analogs of K(M,2)-torsors for general enrichments? Would be
very interested in a reference.

Happy holidays to all!

Since I wrote some first thoughts the other night about Tom Leinster's
question on the above, I've had some second thoughts which are perhaps
a little more sensible, and may remove some of the mystery from these
strange critters (which may be quite beautiful - I've just seen Tom's
example of 10 Dec.).

To get the notation straight, let G be an abelian monoid (perhaps a
group), and V_o the category with one object * and V_o(*,*) = G. Then
V_o underlies a symmetric monoidal closed category V with one object *,
with tensor product o given on objects by *o* = * and on maps by fog = fg,
with unit object I = *, and with internal-hom given on objects by [*,*] = *,
and on maps by [f,g] = fg. 

So we can speak of V-categories, V-functors, and V-natural transformations
at the level of my old paper with Eilenberg, incloding the ordinary category
A_o underlying a V-category A. However all the richer theory of V-categories
etc., as in my book on the subject, needs completeness of V_o for the
definition of functor-categories, and hence for limit- and colimit-notions,
Kan extension, and so on; as well as cocompleteness too, for these to work
well.

So, to this extent, V is a lousy closed category, being neither complete nor
cocomplete. However there is a cure for incompleteness, called "completion";
although "cocompletion" works more smoothly. So let us embed V_o by Yoneda
in its free cocompletion, the ordinary functor-category [V_o^op, Set]. We don't
need the "op" here, since G is abelian. This functor-category is nothing but
the presheaf category of G-sets (sets with an action of G, with the usual
axioms (fg)x = f(gx) and 1x = x). This has a cartesian-closed structure, but
forget that; it also has a symmetric monoidal closed structure arising from
that on V using Day's convolution process. This is nothing but the Linton-
-type s.m.closed structure where the tensor-product A o B represents the
bi-homomorphisms out of A x B, and the internal-hom [A,B] is the G-set of
all homomorphisms of G-sets from A to B. Explicitly, A o B is the quotient of
A x B by the relation (fx,y) = (x,fy).

Let us call THIS s.m.closed category W. Then V is embedded in W by Yoneda,
and the image in W of * is the G-set G itself, seen as a G-set using its own
multiplication - the "regular representation". So we may see V as this "part"
of W.

Now a V-category is nothing but a W-category whose hom-objects all happen to
lie in V (which is a sub-monoidal category of W). Such a category A, with
objects a,b, c, and so on, no longer need be said to have each A(a,b) equal
to *, but instead to have A(a,b) = G.

So the V-categories are nothing but these very special W-categories, and W
is a highly-respectable s.m.closed category, first cousin to R-Mod for a
commurative ring R.

In fact, there is a "free" W-category F(B) on any ordinary category B; it 
has the same objects as B, and (F(B))(a,b) is the free G-set on the set
B(a,b). The V-categories are just those W-categories of the form F(B) where
the ordinary category B is CHAOTIC; that is to say, each B(a,b) is a
singleton.

So at least these nice new objects have a kind of legitimate origin.

Apparently-To: categories@mta.ca

Dear category theorists,

I have a question to which answers will be most appreciated.

To set the stage for the question, consider a category A for which
diagrams D':G'-->A and D'':G''-->A have colimits, colim D' and colim D'',
respectively.  Suppose the sum colim(D')+colim(D'') exists in A.
Then the obvious diagram [D',D'']:G'+G''-->A has a colimit, the sum
mentioned just above, and irrespective of whether any other sums
may exist in A.

So from the existence of some colimits, the existence of others may
be inferred.

Definition:
Relative to a base category A,
for each collection K of (small) diagrams on A with colimits,
the collection of all inferable (small) diagrams with colimits
is said to be a <<repletion>> of K.

Example:
For every nonempty category C,
and every (small) category G with terminal object,
every diagram D:G-->C is in the repletion of the empty collection,
hence in the repletion of every collection of diagrams on C with colimits.

Now for the question.  Has there been any systematic study of what
I have just defined as repletions?  If not, are there in any case some papers
I should consider?

Thank you very much!

Season's Greetings,
David

Post Script (in the traditional sense):

Writers of textbooks in category theory may wish to consider
including the following as an exercise --

For all small categories C and all functors F:C-->Sets, the left Kan
extension of F along Id:C-->C is (isomorphic to) F.

  Axioms and (Counter)examples in Synthetic Domain Theory

  by Jaap van Oosten and Alex K. Simpson

the paper can be found at the URL:

  http://www.math.uu.nl/publications/preprints/1080.ps.gz


ABSTRACT: Chapter 1 presents a development of basic Synthetic Domain
Theory on the basis of 4 axioms (1:\Sigma is complete; 2:\Sigma is
\neg\neg-separated; 3:\bot\in\Sigma; 4:the Phoa Principle). New results
are, that 1 and 2 imply that the \Sigma-order on \Sigma , I and F (the
initial lift algebra and the final lift coalgebra, respectively) is
(pointwise) implication, that 1 and 2 imply that complete extensional
objects (we call them complete regular \Sigma-posets) are stable under 
lifting, that under 1,2,3, axiom 4 is equivalent to \Sigma having binary
joins, and that if \Sigma is closed under N-idexed joins in \Omega, then
all complete objects are stable under lifting. We also present an analysis
of when I is an internal colimit of a diagram 0->L(0)->L^2(0)->...

Chapters 2,3,4 investigate models. We study models of the axioms in: the
Modified realizability topos Mod, the Effective topos Eff, and a particular
Grothendieck topos. In Mod, the Scott principle fails and L(2) is not
complete. In Eff, we have that the internal colimit of 0->L(0)->L^2(0)->...
is complete (whence it is not isomorphic to I), and a general theorem
characterizing I for \neg\neg-separated dominances. Finally, in a sheaf
topos we have an example where L(2) is complete but L(N) isn't.

I think the question as posed by David (relative to a particular category,
in which some but not all diagrams of a particular shape may have colimits)
is a very hard one. A lot is known about inferring the existence of
particular types of colimits, in arbitrary categories, from the existence
of other types: see the paper by Albert and Kelly "The closure of a class
of colimits" in JPAA 51 (1988), and subsequent references of which Max will
no doubt remind us. But when you work in a particular category, there are
so many ways of "mutilating" the category by omitting particular objects
which are required as the vertices of colimit cones, that I suspect there
is almost nothing you can say in general.

Incidentally, a similar comment applies to David's paper "Multilinearity
of sketches" in TAC 3 (1997): I tried to make this point in my review
(MR 98j:18006).

Description :
-------------
 
This topic is dedicated to Fault Avoidance and Fault Removal means
in Real-Time Systems. Fault Avoidance is concerned with modelling means,
development processes and methods, etc., whereas Fault Removal covers models,
verification, testing and diagnosis techniques, etc. In the context of
Real-Time Systems, temporal parameters are important features of both
Fault Avoidance and Fault Removal. It also includes other issues of interest
such as the capabilities of the programming languages to avoid faults and 
to make easier their detections in the real-time applications, their associated 
implementations (such as predictable scheduling), the impact of hardware, etc.

We would like this topic to span from academia to applications and
from scientific approaches to well-engineered real-time systems case studies.

This topic is not concerned by fault tolerance and dependability evaluation
which is covered by Topic 20.


Topics of interest include :
----------------------------
 
          development process for real-time applications
          guidelines to develop dependable real-time software
          quality management of real-time applications
          classification of real-time application faults
          models allowing real-time concepts to be expressed
          verification of real-time constraints
          synchronous real-time languages
          code speed evaluation
          predictable real-time static or dynamic scheduling


Euro-Par conference series :
----------------------------
 
Euro-Par is the annual European conference on parallel computing. It
is dedicated to the promotion and advancement of all aspects of parallel
computing.
 
Euro-Par'99 is  organized as a day  of tutorials, two half-day plenary
sessions, and a number of parallel sessions.

category-theoretic aspects of the following:

concurrent and distributed systems 
constructive mathematics
declarative programming and term rewriting 
domain theory and topology
linear logic 
models of computation 
program logics, data refinement, and specification 
programming language semantics 
type theory

Dear All,

As many of you know, December is the season of two column logic/CS
related preprints. The title of mine is:

    Towards semantics of guarded induction

and it is at the bottom of the page

    http://www.kestrel.edu/HTML/people/pavlovic/

Comments **most** welcome, esp. as I am still a bit in the darkness as
to how to present some parts. This is still an extended abstract, but a
bit more extended and less abstract than the version some of you have
seen before. (Thanks again for the questions that helped me improve it!)

With the very best wishes,
-- Dusko

    Towards semantics of guarded induction
    by Dusko Pavlovic


    Abstract.

We analyze guarded induction, a coalgebraic method for implementing
abstract data types with infinite elements (e.g. various dynamic
systems, continuous or discrete). It is widely used not just in
computation, but also, tacitly, in many basic constructions of
differential calculus. However, while syntactic characterisations
abound, only the very first steps towards a formal semantics have been
made. A language independent analysis was recently initiated, but just
special cases were covered so far.

In the present paper, we propose a new approach, based on a somewhat
unusual
combination of monads and polynomial categories. The first result is
what appears to be a precise semantic characterisation of guarded
operators on arbitrary final coalgebras.

           PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC
               70th meeting -- First Announcement

The 70th meeting of the PSSL will be held in Cambridge on the weekend of
27-28 February 1999. As usual, we welcome contributed talks on any aspect
of category theory, sheaf theory or related areas of logic and computer
science.

It is planned to make this meeting into a celebration of the 60th birthday
of Gavin Wraith, which falls in March 1999. Gavin has been involved with
the PSSL since its inception in 1976, and we hope that his many friends 
will wish to join us in celebrating this occasion.

Further details of the arrangements for the meeting, and a registration
form, will be sent out in January.

Summary of details:

Title: Applications of Rewriting Systems and Groebner Bases to Computing
       Kan Extensions and Identities Among Relations.
Authors: Anne Heyworth (University of Wales, Bangor).
Comments: PhD thesis, 104 pages, LaTeX2e. 
Report-no: University of Wales, Bangor preprint number 98-23.
Subj-class: Category Theory; Combinatorics.
MSC-class: 18-04 (Primary) 05-02; 20F05; 68Q42; 68Q40; 16S15 (Secondary).
\\
This thesis concentrates on the development and application of Groebner bases
methods to a range of combinatorial problems (involving groups, semigroups,
categories, category actions, algebras and K-categories).
Chapter Two contains the generalisation of rewriting and 
Knuth-Bendix procedures to Kan extensions.
Chapter Three shows that the standard Knuth-Bendix algorithm is 
step-for-step a special case of the Buchberger's algorithm for noncommutative
Groebner bases. 
The one-sided cases and higher dimensions are considered, and the relations
between these are made precise.
Chapter Four relates rewrite systems, Groebner bases and automata.
Reduction machines for rewrite systems are identified with standard 
output 
automata and the reduction machines devised for algebras are expressed as
Petri-nets.
Chapter Five introduces logged rewriting for group presentations. 
The completion of a logged rewriting system for a group  
determines a partial contracting homotopy which enables the computation 
of a set
of generators for the module of identities among relations using the 
covering 
groupoid methods devised by Brown and Razak Sallah. 
Reducing the resulting set of submodule generators is identified as a
Groebner basis problem.

A reminder note, and best wishes for the holidays.

LAMBEK FESTSCHRIFT - CALL FOR PAPERS

The (electronic) journal "Theory and Applications of Categories" has
agreed to publish a special volume in honour of the work of our
colleague Joachim Lambek, in celebration of his 75th birthday,
which was marked by a symposium at McGill on his actual birthday last
December 5th, 1997.  We welcome submissions to this volume from anyone
interested. All papers submitted will undergo the usual TAC referee
process, and we are hopeful that the final volume will be ready before
summer 1999.  (For the TAC home page, see <http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/>).

Topics suitable for the volume include any of the subjects to which
Jim Lambek has contributed which fall roughly within the scope of TAC.
For example, categorical algebra, categorical logic and proof theory,
mathematical linguistics, algebra and ring theory (preferably with
some categorical application or methodology), categorical computer
science, etc.

We would like to note that a companion volume is also being prepared
by the journal "Mathematical Structures in Computer Science" - there
may still be room for a very small number of short-to-moderate-length
papers to be included in that volume. If you wish your submission to
be considered for that, please indicate this when you submit your
paper to us.  (Of course, MSCS's emphasis is more towards computer
science).

The submission deadline for the Lambek Fest volume is 30 January,
1999.  Please send a postscript file (uuencoded and compressed, if
possible) to rags@math.mcgill.ca, or 3 paper copies to

 R.A.G. Seely             
 Department of Mathematics
 McGill University        
 805 Sherbrooke St W
 Montreal, Quebec
 Canada, H3A 2K6

(If possible) please send an email message to rags@math.mcgill.ca
indicating the title (and authors, if other than the sender of the
email) of the paper, as well as an abstract (in standard ascii format,
maximum 1 page) of the paper.  

A technical point: TAC can only accept files prepared with some
"flavour" of TeX or LaTeX - most authors ought to be able to arrange
for such a file to be prepared from their paper, but if you have problems,
let us know and we shall see if we can provide helpful advice. General
advice for preparation of papers, including suitable macros, may be
found at the TAC home page, <http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/>.

The Editors: 	Michael Barr    (e-mail:  barr@math.mcgill.ca)

It may be of relevance to some on this list to know that for the past
week, the main machine in the maths dept at McGill has not been
functionning, and so, as a consequence, mail sent to
"user@math.mcgill.ca" will not have been received.  Triples *is*
functionning, so although usually the generic address as above is
preferred, you might try cc'ing any mail you have sent to
"user@triples.math.mcgill.ca" - for those of us that still use
triples, this will get through.  We'll let you know when things are
back to normal - this has been delayed by the holidays, of course.

PS - The categories home page <http://triples.math.mcgill.ca> is still
functionning, which has information about the Lambekfest (call for
papers), the Barrfest (table of contents), and current seminars.
Links on that page to members' home pages may not function, if they
are links to the main departmental machine, however.  (You'll get the
idea from my (revised) sig below...)

    PhD degrees in the Division of Informatics
    at the University of Edinburgh

In 1998, the University of Edinburgh established a Division of
Informatics, to study the structure, behaviour and
interactions of both natural and artificial computational systems.
The Division reflects the University's vision of Informatics
as a fundamental area of study, critical for the future developments
in science, engineering, and society. The Division was formed from
the former Departments of Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive
Science and Computer Science.

The Division has positions for new research degree students pursing
either an MSc(Research) (one year), an MPhil (two years) or a PhD
(three years) through investigation of open problems in Informatics.

The Division now contains over 75 academic staff and about 100 research
students, grouped primarily into these research institutes:

	Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute
	Institute of Computing System Architecture
	Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation
	Institute for Communicating and Collaborative Systems
	Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour
	Institute for Representation and Reasoning
	Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science

which reflect the main research themes in the Division:

	adaptive computing
	artificial intelligence
	automated and mathematical reasoning
	category and type theory
	cognitive science
	computational complexity
	computational learning theory
	computational linguistics and natural language processing
	computational musicology
	computer and network architectures
	computer communications and networks
	computer graphics and virtual reality
	computer science
	computer vision
	database systems
	design and analysis of dependable systems
	diagramatic understanding
	distributed systems
	formal program specification
	human-computer interaction
	intelligent tutoring systems
	knowledge representation and reasoning
	knowledge-based systems
	medical informatics
	mobile and assembly robotics

The UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council
has awarded the Division a number of full studentships
that can be used by UK and EC students. Overseas students
may be eligible for ORS awards, that pay approximately
half of the total costs.

In general, students should have a good BS/BSc degree (or equivalent)
in an appropriate topic, plus other skills appropriate to the particular
research area.

    Master of Science degrees in the Division of Informatics
    at the University of Edinburgh

    The Division of Informatics offers three 1 year courses
    in different topics in Informatics:


        1. MSc in Artificial Intelligence, whose primary focus is on
        development and understanding of intelligent computational processes
        for the benefit of both creating useful artifacts and helping better
        understand intelligence (human or otherwise). The course contains
        five themes: Foundations of AI, Intelligent Robotics, Knowledge-based
        Systems, Natural Language Processing, and Non-Symbolic AI.

        2. MSc in Cognitive Science and Natural Language. This MSc is
        concerned with computational, formal and experimental approaches
        to understanding cognition and natural language. In Cognitive Science,
        the disciplines of formal linguistics, psychology, neuroscience and
        philosophy are brought together in different kinds of computational
        frameworks. This MSc is particularly concerned with how language is
        represented and processed.
     
        3. The MSc in Computer Science contains three themes. The Advanced
        Computer Systems theme embraces the theory and practice of designing
        programmable systems. The Systems Level Integration theme teaches
        the principles underlying the design of integrated software and
        hardware systems in silicon. The Theoretical Computer Science theme
        introduces students to core areas of theoretical Computer Science and
        to the technologies through which theory-based tools are implemented.
    
    From October to April students attend taught modules.
    During the period May - September inclusive, each student
    undertakes a major practical project under the supervision of a
    member of academic staff. The projects can involve industrial 
    collaboration and may be proposed by the student.

    These courses have been approved by the UK Engineering and Physical
    Science Research Council for the tenure of Advanced Course Studentships.

    In general, students should have a good BS/BSc degree (or equivalent)
    in an appropriate topic, plus other skills approporate to the particular
    MSc course.

                     Preliminary Call for Papers
                         28 JAIIO - WAIT'99
           Argentinian Workshop on Theoretical Computer Science
                      Buenos Aires - Argentina
                         September 6-7, 1999




The 3rd Argentinian Workshop on Theoretical Computer Science (WAIT'99)
will be part on the 28th Argentinean Conference on Informatics and
Operations Research (28 JAIIO), to be held in Buenos Aires from September
6th to September 10th, 1999.

The goal of the workshop is bringing together researchers from academy
(from Argentinean and other universities) and industry professionals in
order to discuss theoretical, empirical and experimental results on the
field of theoretical computer science.

This workshop will consist of invited talks and technical presentations.

Contributions are expected in all the areas of theoretical computer
science, including the following:

* Logical and algebraic foundations for computer science (logics for
computer science, category theory, relation algebras, type theory, etc.),

* Formal program construction (formal specification of sequential and
concurrent programs; analysis, verification and transformation of
programs, etc.),

* Algorithms and data structures (sequential, parallel, distributed,
on-line, probabilistic, etc.),

* Computational complexity,

* Automata theory,

* Graph theory,

* Symbolic and algebraic computation.

The expected contributions will describe original results as well as
undergoing research and development projects on theoretical computer
science coming from academy and industry.

Papers will be refereed by the International Program Committee, based
on the following:

* Papers reporting research / experimental results: these papers must
present previously unpublished results and will be judged based on their
originality, significance, relevance and clarity of presentation.
Authors must submit an extended abstract of up to 4 pages containing
enough information to allow the referees to determine the merits of their
work. It is also allowed to submit the full paper of up to 12 pages
including figures and references.

* Research projects: aiming to fostering the cooperation among national
and foreign researchers, short papers describing ongoing research will
be considered. Papers in this category may report already published
results. In that case, the authors must include the corresponding references.

* Industrial / Commercial applications: also relevant are papers describing
applications of theoretical results to real-life situations. Short papers
describing results that are both of significance for industry and that make
novel or defying applications of theoretical results are sought.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:

In order to facilitate the widest dissemination of the papers, authors are
recommended the use of the English language. Nevertheless, papers in Spanish
or Portuguese are also welcome.

The deadline for submission of papers is May 3rd, 1999. Papers must be
submitted electronically in PostScript format (ghostview-readable) to the
e-mail address:
                   wait99@sol.info.unlp.edu.ar

Authors must send in a separate message in ASCII format the following: title
of the paper, name and affiliation of all the authors, their e-mail addresses,
phone and FAX numbers, an abstract of their contribution of at most ten lines,
a list of keywords that best describe the paper, and also the category within
which the paper is to be evaluated.

Alternative ways for paper submission are possible and must be discussed with
the workshop co-chairs.

The format for camera-ready papers will be announced with the letter of
acceptance.
