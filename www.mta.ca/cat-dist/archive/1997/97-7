Thanks to Pino Rosolini for pointing out a typo in my formula:

        for any function f:Sigma x X -> Sigma    (not -> X)
        and predicate    a:X -> Sigma

        f(a) & a  =  f(true) & a

where the parameter x has been suppressed from the equation
so in full it reads, less clearly
	f(a(x),x) & a(x) = f(true,x) & a(x)

C. Butz and P.T. Johnstone: Classifying toposes for first-order theories

Abstract: By a classifying topos for a first-order theory $\Bbb T$, we mean
a topos $\cal E$ such that, for any topos $\cal F$, models of $\Bbb T$ in
$\cal F$ correspond exactly to open geometric morphisms ${\cal F}
\rightarrow{\cal E}$. We show that not every (infinitary) first-order theory
has a classifying topos in this sense, but we characterize those which do by
an appropriate `smallness condition', and we show that every Grothendieck
topos arises as the classifying topos of such a theory. We also show that
every first-order theory has a conservative extension to one which possesses
a classifying topos, and we obtain a Heyting-valued completeness theorem for
infinitary first-order logic.

For those who would prefer to receive a hard copy of this paper, I shall be
bringing a supply with me to the Vancouver meeting.

Since there have been some replies to the query about artificial perception, 
I suppose it's OK to mention my own work in progress.  I have been doing 
research in the formal semantics of neural networks.  I am working on a 
mathematical model in which concepts (formulas) are formed in memory as 
colimits.  The diagrams involve neural structures representing other 
concepts, going all the way back to simple percepts.  A concept is stored 
in memory as a neuron or neuron pool together with its attendant synaptic 
connections.  Logically closed portions of memory are theories.  Functors 
and natural transformations enter in in the usual fashion of categorical 
model theory.  

There is still a lot of work to do on this, and I am still learning the 
mathematics.  I do have a proposed neural implementation of it, and am 
working on a paper.  Previous work along these lines has involved geometric 
logic, so that I could understand some of the basics of learning, which for 
me involves working with an observational logic.  I have a paper on this, 
too.  Finding reviewers for this kind of material in the neural network 
community has been difficult.  If any of this sounds interesting enough 
to discuss, I certainly wouldn't mind getting some feedback from category 
theorists.

Sincerely, 
Mike Healy

Paul Taylor asks:

> I wonder whether anyone has noticed this formula before?

There is a section of my thesis devoted to operators on Heyting
algebras that satisfy this formula.  More generally, I considered
"extensional operators" l : A -> A (A is a H.A.), which are
characterized by any of the following equivalent conditions:

(a) x C y implies l(x) C l(y)  (x,y in A, C a Heyting-congruence on A)
(b) a & l(x) <= l(a * x) <= a -> l(x)  (a,x in A, * in {&,->})
(c) a * l(x) = a * l(a o x)   (a,x in A, *,o in {&,->})
(d)  a * x = a * y  implies  a o l(x) = a o l(y) (a,x,y in A, *,o in {&,->})
(e)  x <-> y <= l(x) <-> l(y)  (x,y in A)

The name "extensional operator" comes from (e).  If A is complete,
extensional operators on A are in 1-1 correspondence with morphisms
Omega -> Omega in the topos Sh(A).  "Logical operators" are what I
called extensional operators satisfying l(true) = true -- or,
equivalently, x <= l(x) (x in A).  The quasinuclei of Banaschewski are
then precisely the monotone logical operators, and nuclei are
(therefore) precisely the extensional closure operators.

Arbitrary extensional operators can be "built" from "below" or from
"above" by specific extensional operators, generalizing the way nuclei
can be built from open, closed, and quasiclosed nuclei, and several
"structure theorems" of this kind exist.  One can also characterize
the subsets of A that can appear as the fixedpoint sets of logical
operators (equivalently the prefixedpoint sets of extensional
operators).

My thesis goes on to study "regular operators" -- the regular elements
in the lattice of logical operators, or, equivalently, those operators
r satisfying r(a->b) = a->r(b) (a,b in A) -- which have an amazing
number of properties (e.g., they are idempotent, they preserve
"regular" joins and "stable" meets, their fixedpoint sets are the same
as the fixedpoint sets of logical operators, any two regular operators
commute, and the join of regular operators is function composition, to
name several).  The set of regular operators on a frame A forms a
complete Boolean algebra isomorphic to N^2(A)/--, i.e., the
double-negation quotient of the *second assembly* of A (where N(A) =
the frame of nuclei on A = the frame of frame congruences on A; see
Johnstone, Stone Spaces, pp. 51--57, for more information on the
functor N and its iterates).  This provides a concrete embedding of
any frame into a complete Boolean algebra.

I have used the theory regular operators to derive an explicit formula
for joins of nuclei, characterize "free meets" in frames, and to
answer some questions about fibrewise-Boolean locales.  My thesis also
characterizes universal monos (and obtains some results about limits
and colimits) in the categories of frames and kappa-frames, and
generalizes some results of Banaschewki on finitely generated frame
extensions.  It appeared as CMU tech report CMU-CS-94-186.

       Calculi for Interactive Systems: Theory and Experiment
                
                  Postdoctoral Research Position 
             University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory

A research position is available as part of an on-going project
consisting of two interlinked strands:

1.  the development of action calculi, a framework for exploring many
models of interactive behaviour, such as the pi calculus and its
extensions, lambda calculi, calculi for security and object-oriented
calculi;

2.  the design and study of foundational calculi based upon the pi
calculus, and  accompanying prototype programming languages, in which
to describe and analyse migratory distributed systems.

We are looking for someone to focus on the dynamics of action calculi,
in particular on issues such as behavioural congruences, the study of
examples, and the analysis of the expressiveness of different calculi.
Applications are encouraged from those with a background in some of
the following: process algebra, operational semantics, type theory and
category theory. Knowledge of action calculi would be helpful but not
necessary.

The start date is flexible.  The position is for between two and three
years, depending on the start date and the age of the applicant. For
further information regarding action calculi, see the web page

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/actioncalculi.html

If you are interested in the research position, please contact
Philippa Gardner at Philippa.Gardner@cl.cam.ac.uk. It would be helpful
if you would enclose a CV and brief research summary.

The following paper is announced:

		On weak higher dimensional categories

	by Claudio Hermida, Michael Makkai and John Power

Abstract: 

Inspired by the concept of opetopic set introduced in a recent paper by
John C. Baez and James Dolan, we give a modified notion called multitopic
set. The name reflects the fact that, whereas the Baez/Dolan concept is
based on operads, the one in this paper is based on multicategories. The
concept of multicategory used here is a mild generalization of the
same-named notion introduced by Joachim Lambek in 1969. Opetopic sets and
multitopic sets are both intended as vehicles for concepts of weak higher
dimensional category. Baez and Dolan define weak n-categories as
(n+1)-dimensional opetopic sets satisfying certain properties. The version
intended here, multitopic n-category, is similarly related to multitopic
sets. Multitopic n-categories are not described in the present paper; they
are to follow in a sequel. The present paper gives complete details of the
definitions and basic properties of the concepts involved in multitopic
sets. The category of multitopes, analogs of opetopes of Baez and Dolan,
is presented in full, and it is shown that the category of multitopic sets
is equivalent to the category of set-valued functors on the category of
multitopes. 



The paper is available by anonymous ftp from triples.math.mcgill.ca in
directory pub/makkai, or via the CRTC home page

	ftp://triples.math.mcgill.ca/crtc.html 

and click on "Makkai".  The paper is in nine files, each with a name
starting with `mult`; they are PostScript files. 

I will send a limited number of hard copies upon request.

some small changes of the arrangements concerning the electronic access to
the paper. 

The paper is available by anonymous ftp from triples.math.mcgill.ca in the
directory pub/makkai/multitopicsets [so, the change is that now the paper
is put into a subdirectory of pub/makkai]. There are ten files [there were
nine before; I have cut the largest into two].

Dear Jim

I don't see the big deal about not having a unit in the monoid when looking
at (pseudo-)actions; throw one in - we know how it should act.  If you
agree to this then what you are looking at is a pseudofunctor (or
homomorphism of bicategories)  R : M --> Cat  where  M  is the monoid
regarded as a one-object category.  Indeed,  M  can be any category.  There
is an equivalence between the 2-category  Hom(M,Cat)  of homomorphisms from
M  to Cat  and the 2-category  Fib/M  of opfibrations over  M.

The study of fibrations has gone off in many directions: for example, it
provides the appropriate way of dealing with categories of all sizes (not
just small) when working in a topos.

As to higher homotopies, Cat doesn't really have enough dimensions for
them. But there are trihomomorphisms  M --> Bicat.  More generally, there
will be higher homomorphisms  M --> WOC  where  WOC  is the weak
omega-category of weak omega-categories - someday  - for now we have
several fairly good definitions of the objects and arrows of  WOC  but
that's as far as it goes.  Higher fibrations is another interesting topic:
Claudio Hermida knows about the 2-category case which is relevant to braids
since 2-opfibrations over a 2-category  M  correspond to homomorphisms  M
--> 2-Cat  where  2-Cat  is self-enriched via the internal hom for the Gray
tensor product of 2-categories (and it is in proving the coherence for this
tensor product where braid groups first seriously entered category theory).

Also, consider any braided monoidal bicategory  B  and let  t  be the n-th
tensor power of some object of  B.  Then there is an action of the kind you
describe of the n-string braid group on the hom-category  B(t,t).  But this
is part of a longer story.

Dear colleagues,

A ps-file of the following short preprint can be picked up from my homepage
(http://www.math.ruu.nl/people/moerdijk)

I Moerdijk, J. Vermeulen, Proof of a conjecture of A. Pitts.

Abstract: Using only elementary properties of inverse limits and localization,
we prove the Beck-Chevalley condition for lax pullbacks of coherent toposes. In
this way, we obtain a simple and constructive proof of the descent theorem for
coherent (pre)toposes.

With best regards, Ieke Moerdijk.

Subject: Signed associahedra

Dear Jim,

> Only thing more I could ask is to have the tree descrition
> in addition to the triangulation description of the cells.

I think we can oblige.  A signed dissection of the (n+2)-gon
corresponds to a plane tree T having n+1 leaves in which
one assigns +,-, or 0 to every "nook" between two branches of
the tree (think of the +,-,0's as being like lint trapped 
between ones toes!).  For example, a vertex having 5 children
in the tree will have 4 nooks between its branches, and hence
require 4 choices of +,-,0. Furthermore, whenever any of the
nooks below some vertex are assigned 0, all of the nooks below
that vertex must be assigned 0.

Then a signed dissection of the first kind (which indexes
the cells in the simple signed associahedron) requires
that only the root vertex can have its nooks assigned 0.
And a signed dissection of the second kind (which indexes
the cells in the non-simple signed associahedron) requires
that only the vertices whose children are all leaves
can have their nooks assigned 0.

The partial order, roughly speaking, translates into contracting non-leaf
edges in the tree and comparing the +,-,0 assignments in the nooks.

Do you know of any category/homotopy theoretic applications for
either of these signed associahedra?

Best wishes,
              Vic Reiner

We are interested in project staff as well as potential project
leaders.  We look for some (but not necessarily all) of these
capabilities:

1. Researchers - Ph.D. Level

   * Experience in program synthesis or related fields
   * Broad knowledge of formal methods and/or Knowledge-based methods
   * Deep knowledge of one or more formal methods areas
   * Excellent implementation skills
   * Excellent verbal communication and writing skills

3. Application Developers

   Our Application Developers may also be researchers and implementors
   who have interest in developing working applications based on our
   technologies.  Activities include documentation, support, contact
   with customers, and training.

   Our current applications include synthesis of very fast scheduling
   algorithms, parallel algorithms, secure software, very large knowledge
   bases, and several others.


The Best Of The Research And Commercial Worlds
  From Theory to Practical Applications
----------------------------------------------
Kestrel provides opportunities for involvement in technology
transition, including equity interest in startup companies.  For
example, Kestrel licensed technology to Reasoning Inc, a company
active in Reengineering and Year 2000 Solutions.  
(See http://www.reasoning.com)

Kestrel is funded through government grants, as well as contracts with
private companies.  In order to prove the feasibility of our ideas,
and to transfer our theories to the real world, our research often
involves implementing working prototype systems and tranferring these
prototypes to commercial enterprises for development of products.

Kestrel Institute itself is an independent, non-profit research
institute, but is also affiliated with Kestrel Development
Corporation, a for-profit corporation.  Kestrel also licenses software
to other commercial enterprises.


Inquiries and Job Applications
------------------------------
Please send a resume or curriculum vitae, a statement of research
interests, a description of previous work, or questions (in any
combination). You may send these in ASCII, MS Word, or Postscript.

We are also interested in recent papers.  When sending email, we
prefer you to send pointers to papers (citations or URLs) rather than
the papers themselves.

If you do not yet have all of your materials assembled, we would
appreciate receiving what you do have (the URL for your web page, for
example).
 
We strive to find world-class people and welcome qualified applicants
from outside the US.  Good English language skills are required.

An addition  to Ross Street's answer.

Wilst the notion of weak \omega-functor is not yet worked out adequately
the corresponding topological theory of A_{\infty} and E_{\infty} maps
between A_{\infty} and E_{\infty}-spaces has been constructed by
Boardman,Vogt, May, Segal and others.
 The theory of natural transformations up to ALL higher homotopies between
simplicial functors has been developed by Dawer,Kan,
Cordier, Porter, Bourn, Batanin, Heller and others.
  Simplicial A_{\infty}-categories and A_{\infty}-functors were defined and
studied by Batanin and topological version of it by Schwanzl and Vogt (they
call them \Delta-categories and use the idea related to the Segal delooping
mashine.)

Let me advertise for some more or less recent work of mine
about sketches/accessible categories (not available electronically,
but I'll be happy to send reprints or preprints on request).
 
-------

(1) Cat'egories accessibles `a limites projectives non vides et
cat'egories accessibles `a limites projectives finies
Diagrammes 34 (1995) 1-10

For fixed b, b-accessible categories with non-empty limits are
characterized as the categories of models of specific sketches.
As a corollary, the category of these categories is Cartesian closed.
(Proved independantly by Ad'amek.)
Accessible categories with finite limits are also characterized.

-------

(2) Effective taxonomies and crossed taxonomies
Cahiers de Top. et de G'eom. Diff. Cat. XXXVII (1996) 82-90

A taxonomy is a "category without identities". This bare structure is
somewhat dull, but "crossed modules of taxonomies" seem more interesting.
In the latter structure, "Dedekind-finite" objects play a role
similar to that of finitely presentable objects in a category.
A notion similar to that of accessibility can thus be defined.

-------

(3) La tour holomorphe d'une esquisse
Cahiers de Top. et de G'eom. Diff. Cat. XXXVII (1996) 295-314

A construction of Lair's in the category of sketches is revisited
and noticed to specialize to the construction of the holomorph
when restricted to groups. The iteration of this construction
reveals two invariants of a sketch: an ordinal and a group.
Some explicit computations are provided.

-------

(4) Cat'egories accessibles `a produits fibr'es
(preprint)

Continuation of (1). Accessible categories with (finite) pullbacks
are characterized in terms of sketches. This is achieved
by introducing "free" colimits in Set: such colimits
are proved to be exactly those that commute with pullbacks.

-------

(5) Limites projectives conditionnelles dans les cat'egories accessibles
(preprint)

For fixed b, those b-accessible categories s.t. every diagram with a
cone has a limit are characterized in terms of sketches.
As a corollary, the category of these categories is Cartesian closed.
Similarly for those b-accessible categories s.t. every non-empty
diagram with a cone has a limit, or for those with
"consistent wide pullbacks".

Some of you have asked: what is q-alg?

q-alg@eprints.math.duke.edu   is a fully automated electronic archive and
distribution server for papers on

        QUANTUM ALGEBRA AND TOPOLOGY (INCLUDING KNOT THEORY)
                    (starting from Dec, 1994)


This is an eprint archive for mathematics papers on ``quantum algebraic''
topics such as quantum groups (also known as noncommutative Hopf algebras) 
and related constructions, representations of affine Lie algebras, vertex 
operator algebras and operads, algebraic aspects of the KP and Toda lattice 
hierarchies, etc.

(JDS: although not listed explicitly, category theroy, especially
higher dim cats, is certainly appropriately posted to this server)

For the time being, the archive also welcomes submissions of mathematics
papers on modern knot theory (Jones and HOMFLY polynomials, Reshetikin-Turaev
invariants, etc.).  A separate archive will be formed for knot theory when the 
traffic becomes sufficient to warrant it.

Papers submitted to this archive should be intended for an audience of
mathematicians; we also welcome cross-listings of appropriate papers from
physics or other fields which are archived elsewhere.


Other mathematics archives running the same software:

 o  alg-geom@eprints.math.duke.edu    Algebraic Geometry
 o  auto-fms@msri.org                 Automorphic Forms
 o  cd-hg@msri.org                    Complex Dynamics and Hyperbolic Geometry
 o  dg-ga@msri.org                    Differential Geometry and Global Analysis
 o  q-alg@eprints.math.duke.edu       Quantum Algebra (including Knot Theory)

  In the generic xxx help text, substitute q-alg@eprints.math.duke.edu
      for the generic e-mail address arch-ive@xxx.lanl.gov

Outgoing mail from the e-print archive has the username no-reply
(to avoid problems due to occasional mail that bounces back).
Commands to the system should always be sent to arch-ive@xxx.lanl.gov
with the command in the subject field (e.g.  Subject: help).
Only one command at a time is accepted. Subscribers automatically
receive a listing of new titles/abstracts on days papers are received.

You will have a more pleasurable time using the archives if you read this
file carefully, read ALL responses you get to your interactions
with the archives, and follow the instructions therein.

This help file summarizes the email interface commands.

Aims and Scope

Graph grammars originated in the late 60s, motivated by
considerations about pattern recognition and compiler
construction. Since then the list of areas which have
interacted with the development of graph grammars has
grown quite impressively. Besides the aforementioned
areas it includes software specification and development,
VLSI layout schemes, massively parallel computer
architectures, database design, modeling of concurrent
systems, logic programming, computer animation, developmental
biology, music composition, visual languages, and many others.
The area of graph grammars and graph transformation
generalizes formal language theory based on strings and the
theory of term rewriting based on trees. As a matter of fact
within the area of graph grammars, graph transformation
is considered a fundamental programming paradigm where
computation includes specification, programming, and
implementation.

The main goal of the School is to disseminate ``the basic
knowledge'' about the area of graph grammars and graph
transformation and to present in a systematic way the state
of the art and the recent advances in the theory and
applications of graph transformation systems. The aim is
to bring together students, young researchers and senior
scientists interested in the area. The expected audience
for the School consists of two groups:

(i) participants from outside the area: these are the students
and researchers who want to learn (for various reasons) about
graph grammars and graph transformation,

(ii) participants from inside the area: these are students and
researchers that already have some knowledge of graph grammars,
but they are interested to get a more systematic insight into
the area.

The objective of the School (especially as the first group is
concerned)  is to make the participants ``literate'' in the
area of graph grammars and graph transformation.  This means
that, after the School, the participants will find it easier
to follow basic literature, and to consider applications of
graph grammars and graph transformations in their areas of
interest. The program of the School covers main developments
in both theory and applications of graph transformation.


Certificates

The School will issue certificates to acknowledge a successful
participation.


Organization

The School is one of the main events organized by the TMR
Research Network GETGRATS (General Theory of Graph Transformation
Systems). Also, the ESPRIT Working Group APPLIGRAPH (Applications
of Graph Transformation) participates in the organization of the
school.


Program Committee

Michel Bauderon, Hartmut Ehrig, Dirk Janssens, Hans-Joerg Kreowski
(Cochair), Ugo Montanari, Francesco Parisi-Presicce, Grzegorz
Rozenberg (Chair)


Organizing Committee

Frank Drewes, Hans-Joerg Kreowski (Chair), Grzegorz Rozenberg


Grants

The organizers hope to be able to offer grants to cover (parts of)
the costs for travel and subsistence.


Information

For more information please contact the organizers by email
({drewes,kreo}@informatik.uni-bremen.de). You can also look
up the WWW homepage of the School. Just follow the respective
link at http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/grp/ag-ti/getgrats.


Registration

To register for the School please return the form at the end
before December 6, 1997. Pre-registrations (without obligation)
are welcome at any time. The registration fee will be around
DM 1200,- - DM 1300,-. This covers lodging (6-7 nights), full
board, and the teaching material including the handbook.


Scientific Programme

The scientific programme consists of 4 parts:

INTRODUCTORY  LECTURE
provides an informal panoramic sketch of the area.   

BASIC CORE
covers basic approaches to defining graph transformations. Each
of the following four approaches is covered by a strand of lectures.

(1) node rewriting
(2) (hyper)edge rewriting
(3) logical descriptions
(4) algebraic approaches

LAYER 1
consists of lectures on various ways of defining graph
transformations not covered in the Basic Core, as well
as various specialistic topics from the 4 strands of the
Basic Core.

(1) term graph rewriting
(2) foundations of the PROGRES approach
(3) concurrency
(4) coordination
(5) 2-structures
(6) pullback-approach
(7) high-level approaches

LAYER 2
consists of lectures covering various applications of graph
transformation and topics strongly rooted in applications.

(1) term graph rewriting in functional programming
(2) the use of PROGRES in a software engineering environment
(3) modularization
(4) distributed algorithms
(5) visual design of distributed systems
(6) image generation
(7) graph drawing

The lectures will be given by leading experts in the field
of graph grammars and graph transformation.


Presentation of Tools

In addition to the scientific programme various systems and tools
(PROGRES, AGG, GRAPHED, CLEAN, COLLAGE-VR, etc.) will be presented.


Teaching Material

- copies of transparencies, relevant papers, and lecture notes
- the Handbook on Graph Grammars and Computing by Graph
  Transformations, Volume 1: Foundations, World Scientific 1997

From: Art Stone <stone@math.ubc.ca>


The Tuesday evening of CT97, 15 July, we contemplate having an
open discussion on the future of publication in category theory.

Questions that are likely to come up:

Are the paper publications really dying?  (With diminishing library
budgets, one Vancouver area university has been forced to cancel
both Cahiers and JPAA, and  with limited library space,  no longer
has available on its shelves journals more than 10 or 15 years old.)
How do we provide for archiving in such a situation?

What are the opinions of the current editors of our journals?

We're fortunate to have TAC.  Is there need for a wider range
of styles of publication?  What are the alternatives?  Is CD-ROM
a possibility?  (Might it give us again the freedom we had in the
early volumes of Springer's LNM -- or would that be a good thing?)

Would it be better to have an e-archive, like q-alg?  How?  Where?
Would it be secure, a lasting archive?  What is to be learned from
existing or past examples: Imperial College, Hypatia,
triples.math.mcgill,  the Sydney category seminar?

Frequently papers appear which the authors subsequently wish they
could change.  And terminology changes over time -- as we begin to
understand what it was we were trying to say.  Might we want to
have "papers" or "books" that can be modified over time (with
ongoing version numbers as we have now for software)?

For the most basic and important works, might we prefer something
that approaches what Bourbaki intended to give us: works that would
evolve over time and never to go out of date?  (Bourbaki's vision

And how do we want to treat the proceedings of CT97?  At first,
papers should be available by ftp on  math.ubc.ca, but what do
we want in the long run?

Similar formulas and their analogs in intuitionistic second-order 
propositional calculus are discussed in my paper in the Annals Pure 
Appl. Logic 27 (1984) 155-164. That paper was motivated by Higgs's 
observation that every monic  Omega -> Omega  in a topos is an involution, 
see Peter Johnstone's paper "Automorphisms of Omega" in Alg. Universalis 
9 (1979) 1-7.

The Next 700 Scripting Languages, or COM meets Functional Programming

More than 30 years ago, Peter Landin proposed to define domain specific
languages by embedding them into the purely functional host language
ISWIM.
The host language captures how things are described in terms of other
things, and is specialized for a certain problem domain by an
appropriate choice of primitive operations. 
In 1997-speak, we would say that Landin proposed to have a single
scripting language to glue together application specific software
components. This is very similar to using Visual Basic for scripting
COM/ActiveX components.
For a purely functional language however, it is easier said than done;
especially if we want to introduce impure, side-effecting, primitives.
Surprisingly,  it turns out that the concept of monads from category
theory provides an elegant solution to the problem of integrating
interaction in a purely functional language. Finally, after 30 years,
Landin's idea can be put into practice, and Fran, Haskell/CGI, Haskore,
Tk/Gofer, AgentScript, and the Haskell-COM integration are collectively
becoming a nice proof of concept.
In this talk we will argue why we think lazy functional language (such
as Haskell) are especially suited as scripting languages as they allow
users to define their own control structures, or as we say, combinators.
During the talk, the Microsoft Agent genie will navigate the Microsoft
internet Explorer through a tour of dynamically generated HTML pages,
everything scripted in Haskell.

Biography
=======

Erik Meijer is currently a visiting research professor at the Oregon
Graduate Institute, on leave from Utrecht University in The Netherlands.
He is known from his theoretical work on functional programming
(Squiggol) and compiler construction, but now spends his time on
practical applications of functional programming, especially promoting
them as scripting languages. He is recently working on making COM
components available from Haskell and encapsulating Haskell programs as
COM components, and is a member of the Standard Haskell Committee.

For a logical proof of Higgs' theorem, based on the above observations
of Scedrov, see Lambek-Scott (Introd. to Higher Order Cat. Logic), p.160,
Exercise 4. A further result along these lines is in Lemma 12.3, p. 190 of
our book.

Dear Colleagues,

the ps-file of the following preprint is available at the homepage
http://www.brics.dk/~butz :

Topological Completeness for Higher-Order Logic

by Steve Awodey (awodey@cmu.edu),
   Carsten Butz (butz@brics.dk).

Abstract: Using recent results in topos theory, two systems of
higher-order logic are shown to be complete with respect to sheaf
models over topological spaces---so-called ``topological semantics''.
The first is classical higher-order logic, with relational
quantification of finitely high type; the second system is a
predicative fragment thereof with quantification over functions
between types, but not over arbitrary relations.  The second theorem
applies to intuitionistic as well as classical logic.

Best regards,

Steve Awodey and Carsten Butz

From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

Since Vaughan insists on doing these things in terms of matrices and
we benighted mathematicians insist on thinking in terms of pairings,
I thought it might be helpful to describe what he did in those
terms.  First off, he erred in writing Chu instead of chu.  So it is
the separated extensional part.  I will describe it for chu(Set,2),
since nothing much changes for other values of K except you get more
dinats.  

I will describe three types of objects.  If A = (A_1,A_2) is an
object, I will say that A_1 is the set of points and A_2 the set of
states and treat A_2 as a set of subsets of A_1.  I will say that A
is type I if there is a point in no state AND if the empty set is a
state.  I will say that A is of type II if there is a point in every
state and if the whole of A_1 is a state.  These would appear to be
quite different, but they are exchanged by the non-trivial
automorphism of 2, which means they have the same properties.  All
remaining objects will be of type III.  The first observation is
that the type is invariant under formation of A -o A.  That is, A -o
A has the same type as A.  Second, if A and B are of different
types, then at least one of Hom(A,B) and Hom(B,A) is empty.  This
implies that if there is a map A --> B, then B -o A can only be
(0,1) or (0,0) (0 is the empty set).  That is is either initial or a
quotient of the initial object.  In either case, it has at most one
arrow to any other object and any diagram starting with it
commutes.  The result of this is that any naturality condition that
involves objects of different types is automatic.  Either there is
no map A --> B to test or there is one and the diagram is
automatically commutative.  For an object of type I, there is a zero
map that takes every point to the (unique!) point not in any state
and takes every state to the empty state.  This is natural
restricted to the type I objects and there is a similar 0 map for
type II's.  Now there are at least four dinatural endomorphisms of
the functor that takes A and B to A -o B.  They are all the identity
on type III objects and can be either the identity or the 0 map on
type I and the same on type II.

Michael
