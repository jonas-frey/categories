One knows that for any topos E that the full subcategory of decidable K-finite 
objects forms a topos itself with 2 = 1+1 as subobject classifier.
It is also said that E_kf, the full subcat of E on K-finite objects need not
form a topos. That's what I could find out from PTJ's Topos Theory. 
The counterexample given there is E = Set^2 (where 2 = 0 -> 1). The K-finite
objects in Set^2 are the surjective maps between finite sets. It is clear that
E_kf is not closed under equalisers taken in E (!). Nevertheless, I think that
E_kf itself does have equalisers : if f,g : X -> Y then take the equaliser 
e_0 of f_0 and g_0 and take the epi-mono-factorisation of x o e_0 :

     E_0 >---> X_0
      |         |
      |  epi    | x        where  X = X_0 -> X_1
      V         V
     E_1 >---> X_1 

this clearly demonstrates that the inclusion  E_kf >--> E does not preserve 
equalisers BUT it does not show that E_kf is not a topos.
I would be interested in a reference or example where E_kf really is not a 
topos. Maybe, E = Set^2 alraedy works but it must have another defect than 
not being clossed under subobjects w.r.t. E because the decidable K-finite
objects have this "defect" as well.

Let me expand. If one bores into just why  Set^2_kf  can't be
boolean and looks for a minimal example of its non-booleaness
one inevitably lands on the object  2 -> 1. At first blush
its lattice of subobjects does look boolean. Until one notices
that there's a monomorphism from  2 -> 2  to  2 -> 1 (where
2 -> 2  is the identity map).

Having noticed that, one has a quicker proof that it's not a
topos: not every mono-epi is an equalizer.

  The answer that first occures me for Thomas Streicher's question is
  that in  Set^2_kf  the terminator generates, hence if it were a topos 
  it would have to be a boolean topos. Which it clearly isn't.

Supplementing Peter's answer to Streicher's K-finiteness question,
I recall Prop. 7.4 on p. 97 of SLNM #753, which states, for presheaf topoi
E = (C^op, Sets), that, with  E_Kf  the full subcategory of K-finite E-objects:
 
E_Kf  is balanced

it's a topos
iff
each K-finite is decidable

Now that the question of finiteness as been reactivated here,
may I bring up again the following question  ?
 
What concept of finiteness is appropriate for those important
mathematical applications in topology for which K/S doesn't
seem right ? (For example the equalizer closure of K/S or...??)
Especially, a suitably "finite" module should be a vector bundle
or a FAC in the sense of Serre so that our simplified topos theory
could apply more directly to those things it should.

Sorry, I used K/S for an abbreviation of what was called
Kuratowski until someone pointed out that it was due to
Sierpinski :an object whose mark belongs to the smallest
sub-semilattice of its power set which contains the
singleton map, or in case there is an NNO an object
which in a suitable sense is locally enumerable by
the segment under a section of the NNO .

While the K/S definition is right for the construction of
the object classifier over an arbitrary base topos (as Gavin
showed) and hence for classifiers for various kinds of
finitary algebras over an arbitrary base topos, still
the theory of it in the last 25 years of topos theory seems
to mainly be justified by formal analogy and/or independence
relative to abstract set theory (=topos with choice).
However there are important uses of "finiteness" in
algebraic geometry and differential topology (where topos theory
after all started)   :
Consider a ringed topos E,R . For example, the sheaves on an
algebraic variety  or on a Cinfty manifold. Within the abelian
category of R-modules in E, we need to single out two important
subcategories
FAC (Serre 1955)=coherent sheaves..these tend to be an abelian
subcategory and tend to vary covariantly as one E,R is mapped to
another E',R' (thus give rise to an extensive K-homology)
and vector bundles , which one thinks of as a finite-dimensional
vector space varying smoothly over the base space of E ,so
they cry out for internalization ; in algebraic geometry these
are identified with locally FINITELY free R-modules... they
vary contravariantly with E,R  (so give rise to K-cohomolgy
rigs which act on the FACs,ie intensives acting as densities on
the extensives; with further conditions on E,R one can at the
level of the riNgs generated by these rigs define a sort of
Radon/Nikodym derivative via an alterating sum of Tors , but
in general the covariant abelian category FAC and the
contravariant tensored category Vect are distinct...The
"derived category" of E,R (now allegedly replacing homological
algebra in complex analysis and C*-algebra theory)  should
be the derived category of one of these two linear categories
(here I mean dc in the linear sense..nonlinear "derived categories"
are more like the stable homotopy of E))

Already the intuitionists speculated about (in effect) subobjects
of K/S objects, and  it seems we need something of the sort
perhaps a category of finites closed under subquotient in
order to define the notion of eg finitely-generated R-module
in a way which not merely mimics abstract set theory but actually
captures the vector bundles .

Perhaps it will be easier if E itself satisfies a noetherian
condition.

It would be best if the desired content could be entirely int-
ernalized to E,R but perhaps it is really relative to a base
S,K..but perhaps without restriction on S ??

I hope this clarifies the problem.
Sincerely
Bill

Not an answer to Bill's question (which I agree is an important one),
but a minor correction. Bill wrote:

It isn't, and he didn't. Gavin used finite cardinals to construct
the object classifier over an arbitrary base topos with NNO (and I
subsequently extended the construction to finitary algebraic
theories), but it doesn't work over a topos without NNO (and in
particular it can't be made to work using K-finiteness). Andreas
Blass showed that the existence of an object classifier for toposes
over E implies that E has a NNO.

Incidentally, I think it is correct to give credit to Kuratowski for
the notion of K-finiteness. It's true that Sierpinski's paper was
earlier, but his definition was a "global" one (i.e. he defined the
class of all finite sets as the sub-semilattice of the universe
generated by he singletons), whereas Kuratowski made the crucial
observation that the finiteness of a particular set X can be determined
locally (i.e. within the power-set of X), without which the notion
could never have been imported into topos theory.

Concerning Peter Johnstone's clarification: Of course I didn't
mean that the object classifier could be constructed without
an internal parameterizer for the finite objects in the base S
.... but what exactly are the finite objects ?
  While the classifier as a topos is determined by the 2-category of
bounded S-toposes , the site for it isn't. I was under the impression 
that an internal category parameterizing the objects which are both
K-finite and separable(=decidable) could be used (while internal
presheaves on "all" K=finites would presumably be much bigger..what
does IT classify ?) Anyway my point was that at any rate no further
extension of the notion of finiteness is needed for classifying in
that sense the objects or the group objects in S-toposes, whereas by
contrast it seems that to give the mathematically correct notion of
"vector space for which there exists a finite basis" does need such an
extension.

In any topos, a subobject of a nonnon sheaf is always separable ;
when is the converse true  ? 

Perhaps there is an internal topos object V which is largest with
respect to being fully embedded in the given topos E while at the 
same time having A as its subtopos of internal nonnon sheaves. Here
by A is meant the Boolean internal topos mentioned above which
parameterizes the separable K-finites of E (Fred recalled Acunya's
work showing among other things that it is Boolean) and to say
that V "is" fully embedded in E has sense for any internal category
with a terminal object  , namely we require that the canonical
parametrized (="indexed") functor from V to E is an equivalence
E(X,V)--> E/X  for each X. The latter functor is defined by merely
pulling back the fibration 1/V--> V of pointed objects in V.
When the answer to the above question is affirmative, Johnstone's
locally separable reflection Vsubqd will consist of subquotients and
the K-finites may fit in . It seems that the inclusion of A in V
will preserve sums but only certain epis.
The idea is that V can't be too large since the inverse to the
inclusion will enrich it in A.

Re:  Finiteness in Toposes				Jan 17 1997

This concerns the possibility , mentioned in my previous message, of two
internal toposes of finite objects.  

 	The conjecture that there are two natural internal categories of
finite objects is partly supported by the fact that there are two natural
natural-numbers objects, the usual one N  that parameterizes compositional
iteration and another semicontinuous one L with the following features:

0)  It is a rig, so receives a homomorphism from N  and its
elementary arithmetic starts out looking very similar.

1)  But unlike N it has a least-number-property in the sense that it is
inf-complete and better.

2)  It can be constructed internally using truth-valued sheaves on N.

3)  Hence it also contains a map from (big) omega, which permits (unlike
N) the use of the standard method in finite combinatorics where (for
example) a binary relation is considered as a matrix which is valued (not
only in a rig where 1+1 = 1, but instead) in a rig in which natural
numbers are distinct;  the resulting generalized characteristic functions
are added, multiplied, infed etc. according to the usual methods of
arithmetic and analysis and then translated back into the combinatorics of
the original finite structures.  Of course, in each case one hopes that
the answer to a combinatorial problem might turn out decidable, but that
shouldnt require us to stay in the bounds of two-valued subsets in the
course of a construction.

4)  This internally-defined order-complete rig in E has also an external
characterization if E is an S-based topos, namely it is the sheaf of germs
of S-geometrical morphisms from E to the topos often called  S-sets
-through-time (I dont think that depends on any presumption that the N in
S ,used to parameterize the transitions through time, coincides with its
completion in S).  In localic or open set terms, there is in S a (T sub
zero) space whose points are N, but whose open sets have the usual order
on N as their specialization order;  continuous functions from any space E
to this space are called semi-continuous and there is in E a sheaf of
them.

5)  The application to the variable linear algebra over algebraic or
complex-analytic spaces needs L too, because dimension of a vector space
is a semi-continuous function.  More precisely, if  A  is a good module in
a ringed topos E, R then for each X and E there should be a map X--> L
which is the fiber-wise dimension of X*A.  The basic case is perhaps that
where E,R is an algebraic affine scheme, and the conceptual problem is to
get at what sort of sets contained in A this dimension function is
counting (or bounding). One should not expect that equality of dimension
will imply isomorphism.

	This object L has been discussed for 25 years, but I dont know if
anyone published the working-out of its properties and role.

Subject: New share package for crossed modules

A new GAP share package written by Chris Wensley and Murat Alp, for
calculating in crossed modules and cat1 groups is now available, and can
be collected from the GAP incoming directory in the file xmod131.tar.gz.
The GAP web page description is included below.

Description 

This package enables construction of and computation with objects within the
equivalent categories of crossed modules and cat1-groups, where the groups
involved are finite of moderately small order. 

A crossed module consists of two groups S and R, together with a homomorphism
from S to R which essentially commutes with conjugation within S and R.
Functions are provided for each of the standard constructions of crossed
modules, and for computing with sub- and quotient-structures and
homomorphisms.

A cat1-group consists of a group G together with two homomorphisms from G to G
satisfying certain conditions. It was shown by Loday that there is a natural
one-one correspondence between cat1-groups and crossed modules. 

An important notion is a derivation of a crossed module, which is a map from R
to S satisfying certain conditions. It is possible to compute all (or all
regular) derivations of a crossed module. There are also functions for
computing the actor of a crossed module X, which is a crossed module whose
range is the automorphism group of X.

Am I right in thinking this to be Idl N, the ideal completion of the
natural numbers (with their usual order)?

I conjecture that this is a suitable value domain for the ranks of matrices
over localic fields such as the reals: rank^-1{n} is not open, but
rank^-1{n, n+1, n+2, ...} is. Then rank A is the set of natural numbers n
such that we can find enough apartnesses to prove linear independence of n
rows of A, and this is an ideal of N - the definition also smoothly
incorporates infinite matrices.

(Perhaps this is just one of the things that have have been discussed for
25 years and I'm reiventing it.)

Anyway, I have investigated Idl N as a fixpoint object (in the sense of
Crole and Pitts) in the category of Grothendieck toposes (modulo
2-categorical niceties that I didn't investigate too closely) in a paper
"Topical Categories of Domains".

Regarding the last message of Bill on finiteness and the answer of Vickers, I
would like to point out that the 25 years old reference of Bill should be the
one at the bottom of page 14 of lesson 3 of 1972 Perugia Notes. In other words,
the L he is suggesting should be the internalization of the following
description: L consists of those ideals T : N---->Omega such that for all n
Tn = Inf{Tm | m > n}.
The precise meaning of this definition is explained in the given reference, as
well as in Bill's messages. I hope that this is correct.

What is the locus classicus for "anafunctors"?  As far as I know,
an anafunctor F: C -> D is a presheaf on C x D^{op} such that
F(c,.) is representable for any object c of C.  Is this how it's
normally defined?  Where is composition of anafunctors discussed?
Are there other names for these things?

I understand this as saying that n is in the ideal iff every greater m is
in the ideal (but I think the inequality m > n has to be non-strict to make
sense of this). Hence it's really a filter of N.

If that's correct, then my suggestion was wrong. L would be not Idl N, but
Idl(N^op). That makes sense regarding dimensions, for if a real vector
space is finitely presented using an mxn matrix A (presenting R^n/Im A)
then its dimension is n-rank(A), so if rank(A) is in Idl(N), the dimension
should be in Idl(N^op).

(By the way, what's a full reference for the "Perugia Notes"?)

Steve.

Regarding my last message on finiteness, I should have said `functors
N---->Omega' instead of `ideals N--->Omega'. I repeat that I `think' that
this is what Bill wanted to say, but I am not sure that I am correct.

As for the reference of Bill's Perugia Notes, they are an internal publication
of Perugia University in 1972 of the lectures given by Bill Lawvere when he
was visiting that University. They should be available there (write to prof.
L. Stramaccia, Dipartimento di Matematica, Universita' di Perugia,
via Vanvitelli 1, 06123 Perugia, Italy, email: stra@gauss.dipmat.unipg.it).
Also, they were quite spread out, so that you should be able to find somebody
nearby you who has them. Other possibilities are asking the author himself and
eventually myself.

At the moment we are investigating logical systems and their relations based
on the formal concepts of institution (Goguen/Burstall) and entailment
system/logic (Meseguer). For our analysis we found  appropriate to use
concepts like "lax indexed functors" thereby having in mind the
corresponding definitions for ordered categories in 
"Extending properties to categories of partial maps" from
Barry Jay [Jay90] (TR ECS-LFCS-90-107).


To give  an impression about what we are doing, 
I will give the definition
that turns out to be the adequate one for our purposes:

A lax indexed functor F from an indexed category C:IND->CAT to an indexed
category D:IND->CAT is given by  functors F(i):C(i)->D(i) for each i in
|IND| and by natural transformations  F(g):C(g);F(j)=>F(i);D(g):C(i)->D(j)
for each morphism g:i->j in IND such that the following compositionality
condition is satisfied for any g:i->j and h:j->k in IND:

   F(g;h) = (C(g);F(h))*(F(g);D(h)).

(We also need the other version where F(g) goes from F(i);D(g) to C(g);F(j).)


To get the right feeling and insight we have developed all necessary results
by ourselves. Especially we were interested in the generalization of the
Grothendieck construction to "lax indexed functors".

Now, before fixing these things in a technical report, were are looking for
corresponding references of work already done in this direction. Especially we
don't want to introduce new names for already known concepts. We need
some advice here...

Our observation is that we have essentially used for many concepts and
results the 2-categorical structure of CAT. Thus we strongly believe that
somebody has already defined and investigated "lax functors" and "lax
natural transformations" for 2-categories.


Thanks for any help.

With all best wishes,

Alfio Martini.

John Baez asked, on January 24, about anafunctors. As far as I know, the
notion was first explicitly introduced in my paper "Avoiding the axiom of
choice in general category theory", in JPAA 108 (1996), 109-173. The term
was suggested by Dusko Pavlovic. Precursors occur in the work of Max
Kelly, and Andre Joyal, as I explain in the paper. The concept John gives
is equivalent to "saturated anafunctor" in the paper; plain anafunctor is
something that generalizes "functor". The wording of the definition of
"saturated anafunctor" is different from John's definition, but the
equivalence is fairly straightforward. I should mention that John`s
definition is a very useful formulation, especially when one wants to
generalize things to higher dimensional categories, as I came to realize
some time after I started studying the John Baez/James Dolan announcement
on weak n-categories. 

In addition to the paper mentioned above, there is reference to
anafunctors in "First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts", a monograph that
will appear in Springer's Lecture Notes in Logic as soon as I manage to
complete the necessary revisions; it is available electronically from the
TRIPLES and HYPATIA (?) sites.

Greetings!

Concerning Alfio Martini's message, I would like to point out that I have
been using a similar notion of what I also called "lax indexed functors".

The only difference is that instead of condition (1) I have the following:

 (\Phi_g,h ; F(k)) * F(g;h) = (C(g);F(h)) * (F(g);D(h)) * (F(i) ; \Phi'_g,h)

where \Phi_g,h:C(g);C(h)->C(g;h) is the natural isomorphism associated
with the indexed category C and \Phi'_g,h is the natural isomorphism
associated with D (the reason being that my indexed categories
C, D: IND->CAT are basically pseudofunctors).

As shown in my thesis abstract below, a generalized Grothendieck
construction is established.

I expect to have copies of my thesis available by the end of April 1997.


Yours truly,

Sandro Fusco

Doctoral Thesis

Title:
Stable Functors and the Grothendieck Construction.

Abstract:
In classical domain theory, Scott-continuous functions of partially ordered
sets (posets) are used to model approximation processes. When replacing
posets by (the more general) categories, the so called "stable functors" take
on the role of Scott-continuous functions. Different notions of stable functors
were studied intensively by various researchers during the past ten years
(notably by Paul Taylor of Imperial College, London, and Walter Tholen of
York University, Toronto). These notions are closely related to generalizations
of two fundamental notions of category theory, adjoint functors, and
fibrations, with no apparent link between the two approaches.
In this thesis, we
1. introduce and investigate a satisfactory notion and theory of stable
 functors based on "factorizations relative to a functor" (as given by
 both, generalized adjoints and fibrations);
2. establish the Grothendieck construction as a 2-functor \Gamma whose
 domain is the 2-category of \{cal X}-indexed categories and whose target
 is the suitably defined 2-category of stable functors with codomain \{cal X},
 in such a way that \Gamma is part of a higher-dimensional adjunction.
This latter part can be exploited at various levels of generality, yielding in
particular the well-known equivalence between \{cal X}-indexed categories and
cloven fibrations.

Dear All,

Can someone give a full reply to this? I was unable to give an adequate 
one with references etc as I have not been working in this area 
recently.  

Thanking you,

Tim.

Dear Friend
I am sorry that I disturb you with this letter but
since nobody here in Cambridge doent seem to know
an answer to something (and since I have seen your
name in Pursuing Stacks of Grothndieck) I am writing
to you with the hope that you probably be able to
answer me . In fact what I try to find out if it is
true, is a very "easy thing": In the paper of Quillen
Higher Algebraic K -Theory there is his theorem about
whether a morphism F:C--->B in Cat is a w.e.: if
we know that all comma categories F/b are contratible
(for any b in B) then F is a w.e. I am wondering if the
converse is definitely true , ie: if F:C---->B is a w.e.
in Cat (in the sense of Nerve functor) then for every b in B
all the comma categories are contractible.
In fact what I want to know is: if we have a commutative
diagram in Cat as
                   H : C -----> B
                       |        |
                    f  |        | g
                       J   =    J
(ie categories over J) where the map H is a w.e. (ie Ner(H) is
a w.e.  of simplicial sets) then for every object j of
the category J , the "map over j" H/j: f/j ----> g/j is a w.e.
Is something like that true? Since the idea of Ouillen in his
criterion is that "F/b plays the role of homotopy fibre of the
corresponding maps of classifying spaces" it seems to me that
the above is true.
But the fact that Quillen doesnt refer this explicitly to his
paper makes me wondering if there is a simple counterexample
where this fails (so there is no reason to sit down and try
to write a proof).
( I know that in the case that we define w.e s in Cat through
cohomology (ie restricting the w.e.s to the comological ones)
the above is true because we actually thinking with the corre-
sponding toposes but is this fact remain true for the case of
Nerve-w.e s ?)
I thank you in advance that you took the time and read this.

Sincerely
