From: Koslowski <koslowj@iti.cs.tu-bs.de>

Dear Colleagues,

An updated preprint of my paper "Beyond the Chu-construction", which
I presented in Vancouver in July, is now available on my web-page

	http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/TI-INFO/koslowj/koslowski.html

The abstract follows below.

  From a symmetric monoidal closed (= autonomous) category Po-Hsiang
  Chu originally constructed a *-autonomous one, ie, a self-dual
  autonomous category where the duality is realized by means of a
  dualizing object.  Recently, Michael Barr introduced an extension
  for the non-symmetric, but closed, case that after an initial step
  utilized monads and modules between them.  Since these tools are
  well-understood in a bicategorical setting, we introduce a notion
  of local *-autonomy for closed bicategories that turns out to
  be inherited by the bicategories of monads and the bicategory of
  interpolads.  Since the first step of Barr's construction carries
  over directly to the bicategorical setting, we recover his main
  result as an easy corollary.  Furthermore, the Chu-construction at
  this level may be viewed as a procedure to turn the endo-1-cells of
  a bicategory into the objects of a new bicategory, and hence is
  conceptually close to the constructions of bicategories of monads
  and of interpolads.

Best regards,

Dear Colleagues,

A technical glitch prevents me from puttting the preprint "Beyond the
Chu-Construction", announced yesterday, on my web page ("no space on
device", which doesn't make sense).

I won't be able to fix this until I return from CTCS97 next Sunday, 
since our technician isn't here right now.  Please wait until next
Monday or Tuesday before downloading the paper.

I'm sorry about this problem.

              BARRFEST PROCEEDINGS - CALL FOR PAPERS

There will be a special issue of the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra
dedicated to Michael Barr, in honour of his 60th birthday, and nominally the
proceedings of the BarrFest, held in Montreal 29 - 31 May 1997.  We invite
submissions to these Proceedings from anyone interested; papers submitted
will undergo the usual JPAA referee process, and we are hopeful that the
final Proceedings will be ready before summer 1998.

Topics suitable for the Proceedings include any of the subjects to which
Michael Barr has contributed, such as homological algebra, triples,
embeddings, exact catgeories, torsion theories, topos theory, topology,
*-autonomous categories, universal algebra, logic, linear logic, computer
science, or linguistics.

The submission deadline for the BarrFest Proceedings is 15 September 1997.
Please send five (5) (paper) copies before then to

 R.A.G. Seely

Groupoids and Crossed Objects in Algebraic Topology
Ronald Brown

Notes for Lectures at the Summer School on the `Foundations of Algebraic 
Topology', Grenoble, June 14 -July 5, 1997 (71 pages). 
Abstract: 
The notes concentrate on the background, intuition, proof and 
applications of the 2-dimensional Van Kampen Theorem 
(for the fundamental crossed module of a pair), with 
sketches of extensions to higher dimensions.
One of the points stressed is how the extension from 
groups to groupoids leads to an extension from the abelian
homotopy groups to non abelian higher dimensional 
generalisations of the fundamental group, as was sought 
by the topologists of the early part of this century. 
This links with J.H.C. Whitehead's efforts to extend 
combinatorial group theory to higher dimensions 
in terms of combinatorial homotopy theory, and which 
analogously motivated his simple homotopy theory.

Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic, PSSL 65

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

The 65th meeting of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic
will take place in Aarhus (Denmark) over the weekend of
1-2 November 1997.

As usual, we welcome talks on category theory, sheaves, logic, and 
related areas.

To register, please fill out the form below and return (preferably by
email) to Carsten Butz (butz@brics.dk, postal address below). 
We would be pleased if you could register before October 20th.

We maintain a WWW-page with information for the seminar, although this is 
only in addition to the standard procedures (which means: registration,
confirmation, hotel and travel information will be sent out by email
or snail mail, as usually). The URL is

http://www.brics.dk/~butz/PSSL65/pssl65.html

The home page contains links to travel information; we point out that there
are several direct flights from London (Heathrow) and Amsterdam to 
Aarhus Airport.
Also, the airport of Billund has many international connections (including
direct flights from Amsterdam, Berlin, Birmingham, Brussels, Paris, 
Frankfurt, London and Manchester).
Both airports are connected to Aarhus City by a good bus service.
>From Central Europe, Aarhus can by reached by train via Hamburg/Flensburg.

Looking forward to meeting you in Aarhus,

Carsten Butz and Anders Kock

I would like to recommend the article by Lakoff and Nunez
(bibliographical data below).  It seems to me that some of the
points they makes are points Bill Lawvere and Walter Noll have been making
for years, and it is a pity that they didn't mention the work in
categorial foundations, synthetic differential geometry, etc
that makes some of the ideas rigorous.

The article:

Mathematics: Sketching Out Cognitive Foundations for a
Mind-Based Mathematics, in Mathematical Reasoning: Analogies,
Metaphors and Images, edited by Lyn D. English, Lawrence Erlbaum

Too bad it is buried in the math ed ghetto.

CONCUR 98: Purpose and Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers and students in order to advance the theory
of concurrency, and promote its applications. Interest in this
topic is continuously growing, as a consequence of the importance and
ubiquity of concurrent systems and applications, and of the scientific
relevance of their foundations.

The scope of CONCUR'98 covers all areas of semantics, logics and
verification techniques for concurrent systems.  A list of specific
topics includes (but is not limited to) concurrency related issues about
models of computation and semantic domains,
process algebras, Petri nets, event structures,
real-time systems, hybrid systems,
decidability,  model-checking, verification techniques,
refinement techniques, term and graph rewriting, 
distributed programming, logic constraint programming, 
object-oriented programming, typing systems and algorithms, 
applications, case studies, tools and environments for programming and
verification.


Submissions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submissions consist of a 100-200 word ASCII abstract and a 15 page
summary. Electronic submissions in PostScript(tm) are strongly encouraged.

Proceedings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS
series. 

Venue and local arrangements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nice is ideally located on the French Riviera. September is still
bathing season, while less crowded as full summer.  Nice's
international airport is well-connected to all major european and
non-european cities.

The Organizing Committee of CONCUR 98 is composed of Amar Bouali,
Gerard Boudol, Ilaria Castellani, Silvano Dalzilio and Massimo Merro.

An effort will be made to have reasonably low conference fee and
accommodation expenses.

Dear Colleagues,

This Summer I was made aware of the Topology Atlas, a web-project
centering around all aspects of topology.  You can find it at

	http://www.unipissing.ca/topology/

Would a similar project be useful for category theory?

Best regards,

                        CALL FOR PAPERS


The general theme of this series of conferences is the use of crisp,
clear mathematics in the discovery and design of algorithms and in the
development of corresponding software or hardware. The conference
theme reflects the growing interest in formal, mathematically based
methods for the construction of software and hardware. The goal of the
MPC conferences is to report on and significantly advance the state of
the art in this area. Previous conferences were held in 1989 at
Twente, The Netherlands, organised by the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, in
1992 at Oxford, United Kingdom, and in 1995 at Kloster Irsee, Germany,
organised by Augsburg University.


                          SUBMISSION
=20
Full papers should be submitted in Postscript format by e-mail to
reach Johan Jeuring by December 15, 1997. The details of the
submission procedure can be found at

  http://www.md.chalmers.se/Conf/MPC98/how_to_submit.html=20

Although there is no page limit, submissions should strive for
brevity. Simultaneous submission to the conference and a
post-conference workshop is allowed.


                            TOPICS

The emphasis is on the combination of  c o n c i s e n e s s  and=20
p r e c i s i o n  in  c a l c u l a t i o n a l  t e c h n i q u e s=20
for program construction. We solicit high quality papers on original
research, typically in one of the following areas:

  - formal specification of sequential and concurrent programs;
  - constructing implementations to meet specifications;

in particular,

  - program transformation;
  - program analysis;
  - program verification;
  - convincing case studies.

While this list is not exclusive it is intended to show the focus of the
conference.

We expect to publish the proceedings as a Springer LNCS, ready at
the conference.


                             VENUE

Marstrand is a small island on the beautiful westcoast of Sweden, 40
km from G=F6teborg. The charming old houses, the fortress, the walking
paths, and the absence of cars make this island a very pleasant
resort. There are direct flights to G=F6teborg Landvetter from most
European main cities, and busses from G=F6teborg to Marstrand.
