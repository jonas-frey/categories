I have put on the web

http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/hdaweb2.htm

an article with the above title. This is intended to give general readers
an idea of what this subject is about, so it is non technical, and that is 
why it has a link from the sculpture site. We want to inform scientists
and young mathematicians of what is going on, and to get 
discussion of these ideas.

The references could be enlarged and improved, and I would welcome 
suggestions on this. 

I would welcome comments on this article before submitting it for
publication.

PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC

        64th meeting - second announcement

Just a reminder for those who haven't sent in their registration forms.
Please do so before next week so we can make hotel reservations.

The 64th meeting of the seminar will be held at the Department of
Theoretical Computer Science of the Technical University in
Braunschweig, Germany, over the weekend of May 10-11, 1997.  The
seminar welcomes talks using or addressing category theory or logic,
either explicitly or implicitly, in the study of any aspect of
mathematics or science.

On Friday, May 9, 13:00, i.e., before the regular seminar, there will
be an official Colloquium Talk by Maria Cristina Pedicchio on

   Exactness and Regularity for Locally Presentable Categories

After that, we would like to invite those who arrive here early to
visit the Herzog August Library in Wolfenb"uttel with its famous
collection of medieval books.  Gotthold Ephraim Lessing used to be a
librarian there.

Braunschweig is located about 60 km East of Hannover and can easily be
reached by car or train.  The closest airport is in Hannover; the
airport bus to the Hannover train station takes about 20 minutes, and
the train from there to Braunschweig takes about 40 minutes or less.
We will send further information on the location of the seminar, along
with details on local travel and accommodation to those who register,
at least a week before the meeting.

                     CALL FOR PAPERS 
 
           International Static Analysis Symposium (SAS'97)

               Paris, France, 8--10 September 1997

              http://lix.polytechnique.fr/~radhia/sas97



Static Analysis is increasingly recognised as a fundamental tool for
high performance implementations and verification systems of high-level
programming languages. The last two decades have witnessed substantial
developments in this area, ranging from theoretical frameworks to
design, implementation, and application of analysers in
optimising compilers.

The Fourth International Static Analysis Symposium (SAS'97) will be
held in Paris to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the publication of
the seminal paper of Patrick and Radhia Cousot in the Proceedings of
the Principles of Programming Languages Conference (POPL'77). Previous
symposia were held in Namur, Glasgow, and Aachen.

The technical program for SAS'97 will consist of invited lectures,
tutorials, panels, presentations of refereed papers, and software
demonstrations. Contributions are welcome on all aspects of Static
Analysis, including, but not limited to

    Abstract Interpretation                Optimising Compilers           
    Complexity                             Theoretical Frameworks         
    Experimental Evaluation                Verification Systems           
    Specific Analyses                      Type Inference                 
    Partial Evaluation                     Abstract Domains 


Submissions can address any programming paradigm, including
concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative, logic and
object-oriented programming.  Survey papers that present some aspect
of the above topics with a new coherence are also welcome.

Papers must be written in English, must not exceed 15
pages (excluding references and figures), and must contain a cover
page containing the following: a 200-word abstract, keywords, postal
and electronic mailing addresses, and phone numbers and fax numbers of
one of the authors.  Submissions should arrive by
APRIL 7, 1997 either by email (a Postscript
file) or by post (six paper copies) at the address

                                 Synopsis

We study the enrichment of models of axiomatic domain theory.  To this end, we
introduce a new and broader notion of domain, viz. that of complete cuboidal
set, that complies with the axiomatic requirements.  We show that the category
of complete cuboidal sets provides a general notion of enrichment for a wide 
class of axiomatic domain-theoretic structures. 

 Cuboidal sets play a role similar to that played by posets in the traditional
 setting.  They are the analogue of simplicial sets but with the simplicial 
 category enlarged to the cuboidal category of cuboids, i.e. of finite 
 products  O_n1 x ... x O_ni  of finite ordinals.  These cuboids are the 
 possible shapes of paths.  A cuboidal set  P  has a set  P(C)  of paths of 
 every shape  C = n1 x ... x ni;  indeed, it is a (rooted) presheaf over the 
 cuboidal category.  The set of points of  P  is  P(O_1).  The set of 
 (one-dimensional) paths of length  n  is  P(O_n+1);  they can be thought of 
 as (linear) computations conditional on the occurrence of  n  linearly 
 ordered events  e_1 < ... < e_n.  Evidently,  O_n  is the partial order 
 associated to this simple linear event structure, and can be considered as a 
 sequential process of length  n.  At higher dimensions,  P(O_n1 x ... x O_ni)
 can be thought of as the set of computations conditional on the occurrence of 
 n_1 + ... + n_i  events ordered by  e_1,1 < ... < e_1,n1 ; ... ; 
 e_i,1 < ... < e_i,ni.  This is the event structure which can be considered 
 as  i  sequential processes, of respective lengths  O_n1, ..., O_ni,  running 
 concurrently.

 Complete cuboidal sets are cuboidal sets equipped with a formal-lub operator 
 satisfying three algebraic laws, which are exactly those needed of the lub 
 operator in order to prove the fixed-point theorem.  Computationally, the 
 passage from cuboidal sets to complete cuboidal sets corresponds to allowing 
 infinite processes.  In fact, the formal-lub operator assigns paths of shape 
 C  to `paths of shape  C x omega',  for every  C.  Here the set of paths of 
 shape  C x omega  is the colimit of the paths of shape  C x O_n;  such paths 
 can be thought of as the higher-dimensional analogue of the increasing 
 sequences of traditional domain theory.

                    GAMES AND COMPUTATION
       Laboratory for the Foundations of Computer Science
                      JUNE 23-24 1997

The use of games to model various aspects of computation has been notably
successful over the past few years. In particular, two areas where there
has been rapid progress recently are: game semantics and its applications
to programming languages and logic; and the use of games in verifying
properties of concurrent processes.

Game semantics has been used to give the first syntax-independent
constructions of fully abstract models for functional languages such as
PCF and FPC (Abramsky,Jagadeesan and Malacaria, Hyland and Ong, Nickau,
McCusker), for
imperative languages such as Idealized Algol (Abramsky and McCusker), and
for languages with non-local control operators such as call-cc (Ong,
Laird). There are promising applications to object-oriented languages in
progress.

In the area of concurrency, games have been used to explicate
bisimulation and proof-search in the modal mu-calculus (Stirling). This has
been applied to the Edinburgh Concurrency Workbench by Perdita Stevens, and
has resulted in improvements to the efficiency of the implementation.

experimental results in the design, evaluation or implementation of
programming/specification languages.  Areas of particular interest
include but are not limited to:

    * Implementation, optimization
    * Theory, semantics
    * Abstract interpretation, flow analysis
    * Partial evaluation
    * Parallel and distributed languages
    * Object-oriented languages
    * Functional and logic languages
    * Multiparadigm languages
    * Real-time and fault-tolerant languages
    * Requirements, design, and specification languages
    * Internet programming languages
    * Domain-specific languages

Papers should be at most 20 double-spaced pages in length, should have
an abstract of 250 words, and a separate cover page indicating the
title, authors, and a list of keywords.  Papers will be judged on the
basis of their relevance, significance, originality, correctness, and
clarity.  Accepted papers will appear in a full proceedings published
by the IEEE Computer Society Press, for which authors will be expected
to sign a copyright release form.

Papers may be submitted electronically by sending an e-mail containing
a platform-independent PostScript file (which can be printed on A4
and/or on 11" x 8.5" paper) to the address iccl98@csc.ncsu.edu, or by
sending 5 copies of papers to Purush Iyer, program committee co-chair,
at the address below.  Submissions should be accompanied by a cover
letter that includes a return mailing address, telephone number and
email address.  The papers are due by Oct 1, 1997.  Authors will be
notified of acceptance or rejection by Jan 20, 1998.  Camera ready
versions of accepted papers will be due Feb 15, 1998.

On the day prior to the Conference, a workshop on Internet programming
languages is being planned by Henri Bal (bal@cs.vu.nl) and Boumediene
Belkhouche (bb@eecs.tulane.edu); details for this and other
pre-conference activities will be publicized in a separate

The location:
Located near the equatorial line in the northeastern coast of Brazil,
Fortaleza, the capital of the state of Ceara', lies by the beach between the
Ceara' and the Coco' rivers, in the middle of 570km (360mi) of sandy beaches
of the State's coast. The hightest point in the city is only 30m (100ft) high
and its beach front is formed of sand dunes up to 10m high and coconut trees.
The weather is dry and sunny. A permanent breeze comes from the ocean and keeps
the air clean and healthy while the temperature rests on a nice level year
around. The lack of rain during most of the year, now a blessing for the
visitors, prevented a definitive settlement in the area of Fortaleza until the
middle of the 17th century. At that time, need to assure the hold of the land,
the Portuguese established the "Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora da Assuncao" in the
same place where a hundred years before the dutch had built the
Schoonenbroch Fort. Fortaleza, named after the fortress, has been since then an
important trading center and an artistic and cultural center of the country.

Dear Colleague,
 
This message is to remind you that a special issue of TCS dedicated to
the topic "Proof-search in type-theoretic languages" has been
announced, with Didier Galmiche and I as guest editors. Following 
some requests, we have delayed the submission deadline. 

So, please find enclosed the corresponding last call for papers. 
The new (and firm) submission deadline is 15 September, 1997.

Prospective contributors are warmly invited to contact 
either of the guest editors to discuss the suitability of topics and
papers. The submissions should satisfy the usual standards of
scholarship, originality and high-quality of the TCS journal. 

Kind regards,

              Guest Editors:   
              
              Didier Galmiche	           David Pym   
              CRIN-CNRS & UHP Nancy 1      Queen Mary & Westfield College
              Nancy, France                University of London 
            



        Algorithmic proof-search is a fundamental enabling technology 
        throughout artificial intelligence and computer science.    
        There is a long history of work in proof-search in a variety 
        of systems of logic, including classical, intuitionistic, 
        relevant, linear and modal systems, at the propositional, first-  
        and higher-order levels. Such work has ranged from the 
        most abstract to the most practical and has employed 
        the full spectrum of logical techniques, from proof theory, 
        model theory and recursion theory. 

        Recently, there has been a great deal of work on proof-search 
        in type-theoretic languages. Such languages can be thought 
        of as logical frameworks to represent proofs and to formalize 
        connections between proofs and programs. 

        Two recent workshops on "Proof-search in Type-theoretic Languages" 
        (Nancy, 1994 and Rutgers University, NJ, 1996) have provide exchanges 
        of ideas and experiences in topics concerned with proof-search in type
        theory, logical frameworks and their underlying (e.g., classical,
        intuitionistic, linear) logics. 
	
        Here again, the scope of languages studied and techniques
	employed has been wide, stretching to include algebraic and
	categorical methods.    

        From the computational point of view, the type-theoretic 
        component of logical languages, which may involve 
        propositional, first-order, higher-order or polymorphic 
        assignment regimes, introduces significant challenges for 
        both theoreticians and implementors.  



        ***************
        *   TOPICS    * 
        ***************

        Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:        
 
	* Natural deduction, sequent calculi systems for
	  type-theoretic languages. Based-on tableaux, matrix or
	  resolution methods for proof-search in type-theoretic
	  languages.  

        * Semantic techniques in proof-search. Search vs. deduction as
	  the basis of logic; consequences for model theory 

        * Theorem proving and program development with type-theoretic
	  languages: concepts, techniques, implementation and
	  experimentation   

        * Logic programming in type-theoretic languages 
          as search-based computation; integration of model-theoretic 
          semantics and imperative aspects of logic programming 

        * Operational semantics and proof theory of search-based
	  computation.

          Denotational semantics and model theory of search-based
          computation.

        * Complexity of search problems in type-theoretic languages; 
          comparisons with non-type-theoretic systems.

Title: The role of Michael Batanin's monoidal globular categories
            Lecture I:  Globular categories and trees
            Lecture II: Higher operads and weak omega-categories

        This is a report on recent work of Michael Batanin. The goal of his
work is to provide an environment for defining the concepts associated with
weak omega-categories and for developing the ensuing theory.  The approach
is "globular".

        To put this in context, I might mention some important steps in the
development of weak omega-categories. Categories were defined by
Eilenberg-Mac Lane in 1945. Monoidal and symmetric monoidal categories were
defined by Mac Lane in 1963.  Ehresmann defined (strict) n-categories in
1966.  B=E9nabou defined bicategories in 1967.  In the early 80s, monoidal
bicategories were in the air but a full definition was not published in
that period. Joyal-Street defined braided monoidal categories in 1985.
Gordon-Power-Street defined tricategories in 1991 (this, and the coherence
theorem, were published in 1995). Braided monoidal categories were defined
by Kapranov-Voevodsky-Baez-Neuchl-Breen around 1993.  Trimble produced a
definition of tetracategory in 1995.
        Diverse approaches to weak n-categories for all n have appeared.
Street (1985) suggested a simplicial definition with horn filler
conditions.  Trimble (1994) approached the problem using operads and
Stasheff associahedra.  Baez-Dolan (1995) have a definition using typed
operads and opetopes.  Tamsamani (1996) gave a multisimplicial definition.
Batanin uses higher operads and globular sets.

                                Abstract.

The paper is devoted to the problem of defining weak
$\omega$-categories.
The definition presented here  is based on a nontrivial 
generalization of the apparatus of operads and their algebras, 
originally developed by P.May \cite{May} for the needs of algebraic
topology. 

Yet, for the purposes of higher order category theory, a higher 
dimensional notion of operad is required. 
Briefly, the idea of a higher operad may be explained as follows.

An ordinary non-symmetric operad in $Set$  associates  a set $A_{n}$ 
to every integer $n$. The set of integers may be interpreted 
as the set of $1$-cells in the free category generated by one object 
and one nonidentity endomorphism of this object. To find  a higher order
generalization of the notion of operad we have to describe the free 
strict $\omega$-category  generated by   one object 
and one nonidentity endomorphism of this object and one nonidentity 
endomorphism of this endomorphism and so on (so, for example, the set 
of integers is the one-dimensional part of this category). The required
$\omega$-category $Tr$ will be the category of planar trees of a special
type. The $k$-th composition of cells will be given by the colimit of
the diagram of trees over a special tree $M_{n}^{k}$. 

The other component of the theory of operads is an appropriate 
monoidal category (with some extrastructure like braiding 
or symmetry) where one can consider the notion of operad.  We 
need also  a monoidal category (perhaps, with extrastructure as 
well) where one can define the notion of algebra for an operad. Finally,
the corresponding coherence theorems for both types of monoidal
categories are required.
    I call all these components a natural environment 
for a given theory of operads. One of my main goals was to find a 
natural environment for the theory of higher order operads.

 For this I introduce  monoidal globular categories and show 
they are suitable for  the development of the theory of higher order
operads. The crucial point here is a coherence theorem for monoidal
globular categories (section 4) which includes as  special cases the
coherence theorems for monoidal, symmetric monoidal, and braided
monoidal categories and a sort of pasting theorem for
$\omega$-categories.

A primary example of a globular monoidal category is the globular 
category of $n$-spans $Span$. The $0$-spans are just the sets. The 
$1$-spans are the spans in $Set$ in the usual sense. In some informal
sense, an $n$-span is a relation between two $(n-1)$-spans. This
globular monoidal category plays the same role for   higher-order
category theory as the category of sets does for ordinary category
theory. 

These results  allow me to formulate the notion of higher order 
operad.
       An $\omega$-operad  will associate an $n$-span to 
       every $n$-cell in $Tr$ for every $n\ge 0$.} There are
       also the units and multiplications  and some axioms for
       these operations.  
The category of non-symmetric operads (in the 
category of sets) is just a one-dimensional subcategory of the category
of $\omega$-operads. 

Finally, Iintroduce a notion of a  contractible  
$\omega$-operad, So the main definition is:

        A weak $\omega$-category is a globular set together 
        with the structure of  algebra over a universal
contractible          $\omega$-operad.

I construct also a  fundamental $n$-groupoid functor from topological
spaces to the category of weak $n$categories for all $n$ including
$\omega$ and consider another examples of weak $n$-categories, hifger
operads and their algebras.

                  Final Call for Papers

            Sixth International AMAST Conference
     AMAST '97,  December 13-17,  1997,  Sydney, Australia.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals

The major goal of the AMAST Conferences is to put software
development technology on a firm, mathematical foundation.
Particular emphasis is given to algebraic and logical foundations
of software technology.  An eventual goal is to establish algebraic
and logical methodologies as practically viable and attractive
alternatives to the prevailing approaches to software engineering.

Previous meetings of AMAST were held in Iowa (1989 and 1991), 
Twente, Holland (1993), Montreal (1995) and Munich (1996).  
During these meetings, AMAST has attracted an international spread 
of researchers and practitioners interested in software technology, 
programming methodology and their algebraic and logical foundations. 
In addition, the first day of each conference has been dedicated to 
Mathematics Education for Software Engineers.

Following this successful trend, the sixth AMAST International
Conference will be held at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, 
from December 13 to December 17, 1997.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Submissions

As in the previous years we invite papers reporting original research in  
algebra and logic, suitable as a foundation for software technology,
as well as software technologies developed by means of logic and
algebraic methodologies. Submissions should not have been published 
and should not be under consideration for publication elsewhere.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the
following:


SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
	systems software technology,
	application software technology,
	concurrent and reactive systems, 	
	formal methods in industrial software development,
	formal techniques for software requirements, design.

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY
	logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms,
	constraint programming and concurrency,
	program verification and transformation,
	specification languages and tools,
	formal specification and development case studies.

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS
	logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra,
	algebraic foundations for languages and systems,
	theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning,
	logics of programs.

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers)
	software development environments,
	support for correct software development,
	system support for reuse,
	tools for prototyping,
	validation and verification,
	computer algebra systems,
	theorem proving systems.

We invite prospective authors to submit electronically previously
unpublished papers of high quality.  Papers should be between five
and fifteen pages in LNCS style.  Ten page papers are ideal, and 
papers longer than fifteen pages may be rejected without detailed
refereeing.  Please see details at http://www.cs.mq.edu.au/amast97
under "submission" which explain how to get a paper number, and
then send a fully self-contained postscript file (preferably 
derived from LaTeX with the LNCS style on a Unix system) to 
amast97@mpce.mq.edu.au .  If for any reason it is impossible
to submit electronically authors may send six paper copies of their
submission to the programme chair at the address below.

All papers will be refereed by the programme committee, and will be
judged based on their significance, technical merit, and relevance
to the conference. As in the past, we expect the proceedings to
be published by Springer-Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Computer
Science Series.  Papers should be received by May 15, 1997.

SCOPE

The IC-EATCS (European Association of Theoretical Computer Science)
Advanced Schools focus on specific subjects of Theoretical Computer Science, 
and address an international public formed both by PhD students and by researchers 
who wish to deepen their knowledge of the field.
Besides the didactical purpose, these events aim at the dissemination of
advanced scientific knowledge and at the promotion of international contacts
and exchange of ideas among scientists. They intend to be an occasion,
especially for the youngest participants, to meet other people interested in
their research with whom to discuss ideas and to compare approaches and
results.

The IC-EATCS 1997 Advanced School will focus on "Models and Paradigms for
Concurrency". The aim is to provide a overview of some of the hot topics in
the field of Concurrency Theory, particularly concerning computational
models and linguistic paradigms.

If there are PhD students interested in taking an examination at 
the conclusion of the School, such an examination will be scheduled 
on Saturday 20 September, and will consist of exercises agreed upon by the
Organizers and the Lecturers.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROGRAMME

There will be 3 main courses of 10 hours each. Every course will be parted
in 5 lectures of 2 hours, one per day.
Additionally, there will be  invited talks, one per day, of 1 hour and

Some people informed me that they have had the difficulties in printing
out the dvi file of my paper

"Monoidal globular  categories as a natural environment for the theory
of weak n-categories"

It seems that the following address works better

From: Ross Street <street@mpce.mq.edu.au>

With computers, things we expect to be simple never are!

Last week I announced the placement on the WWW of the notes (see the short
description below) of my two lectures at the Conference on Higher Category
Theory and Mathematical Physics, Northwestern University (Evanston,
Illinois;  28-30 March 1997). The site is:

       <www-math.mpce.mq.edu.au/~coact/street_nw97.ps>

I'll spare you the details of the problems, but, up until today, what was
at this site was an old version prepared before the conference. This is not
what I had intended. I am truly sorry to people who have downloaded that
version already.

The correct version is NOW at the site. There still seems to be a problem
when the document is viewed (by some "ghost" technology) but it does (at
least for us) print out pretty well. There is a colour table on page 2
which even seems to view correctly!  I am extremely grateful to Ross Moore
and Sjoerd Crans for helping me out of the mess I (and my little Mac)
created.

I invite people who have downloaded the old version to try again; I am
really sorry.

Title: The role of Michael Batanin's monoidal globular categories
            Lecture I:  Globular categories and trees
            Lecture II: Higher operads and weak omega-categories

        This is a report on recent work of Michael Batanin. The goal of his
work is to provide an environment for defining the concepts associated with
weak omega-categories and for developing the ensuing theory.  The approach
is "globular".  Apart from providing a precise definition of weak
omega-category, the work gives a new algebra of planar trees and uses them
to define higher operads which I believe will find many other applications.

Note that, in the meantime (and again not without trouble!), Michael
Batanin has announced his paper containing the full details of this part of
his work. It is available at:
        <http://www-math.mpce.mq.edu.au/~mbatanin/papers.html>

Happy surfing and enjoy the trees.

Ross
