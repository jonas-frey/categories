               Fourth International Conference on=20

               MATHEMATICS OF PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION
               -----------------------------------

             http://www.md.chalmers.se/Conf/MPC98/
            =20
                      June 15 - 17, 1998

                       Marstrand, Sweden

                        CALL FOR PAPERS

The general theme of this series of conferences is the use of crisp,
clear mathematics in the discovery and design of algorithms and in the
development of corresponding software or hardware. The conference
theme reflects the growing interest in formal, mathematically based
methods for the construction of software and hardware. The goal of the
MPC conferences is to report on and significantly advance the state of
the art in this area. Previous conferences were held in 1989 at
Twente, The Netherlands, organised by the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,
in
1992 at Oxford, United Kingdom, and in 1995 at Kloster Irsee, Germany,
organised by Augsburg University.

                            TOPICS

The emphasis is on the combination of  c o n c i s e n e s s  and=20
p r e c i s i o n  in  c a l c u l a t i o n a l  t e c h n i q u e s=20
for program construction. We solicit high quality papers on original
research, typically in one of the following areas:

  - formal specification of sequential and concurrent programs;
  - constructing implementations to meet specifications;

in particular,

  - program transformation;
  - program analysis;
  - program verification;
  - convincing case studies.

While this list is not exclusive it is intended to show the focus of the
conference.

We expect to publish the proceedings as a Springer LNCS, ready at
the conference.

                             VENUE

Marstrand is a small island on the beautiful westcoast of Sweden, 40
km from G=F6teborg. The charming old houses, the fortress, the walking
paths, and the absence of cars make this island a very pleasant
resort. There are direct flights to G=F6teborg Landvetter from most
European main cities, and busses from G=F6teborg to Marstrand.

                          SUBMISSION
=20
Full papers should be submitted in Postscript format by e-mail to
reach Johan Jeuring by December 15, 1997. The details of the
submission procedure can be found at

Dear Colleagues,
Let $Vect_k$ be the category of vector spaces over a field $k$ and $I$ a
small category. Consider the category $I-Vect_k$ of all covariant functors
from $I$ to $Vect_k$.
For two object $F,F'$ of the category $I-Vect_k$ consider their tensor
product $F\otimes F'$ such that $(F\otimes F')(i)=F(i)\otimes F'(i)$ for
all $i\in I$ and in the obvious way on the morphisms of $I$.

1) Is it true that this tensor product $F\otimes F'$ is injective provided 
that $F$ and $F'$ are injective?

I am really intersted in its particular case. Namely, let $G$ be a finite group
and $O(G)$ the finite associated category of canonical orbits. Objects of
$O(G)$ are given by the finite $G$-sets $G/H$ for all subgroups $H\subsetq G$ 
and  morphisms by eqivariant maps.

2) What about preserving the injectivity by the above defined tensor product
in the functor category $O(G)-Vect_k$?
If that is not true for $I=O(G)$ then I would greatly appreciate getting 
a counterexample.
Many thanks in advance for your kind attention on the problem above.
With my best regards,

Marek Golasinski

From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

I have given some thought to this question.  I do not have a complete
answer, but no one else has posted anything, so I will give what I 
have.  First off, the functor category [I,Vect_k] is an AB5 category
with a projective generator and hence a module category.  In the particular
case that I is the orbits of a group, finite or not, it is just k[G]
modules.  Now if k is finite, then k[G] is semisimple, whence all modules
are injective, unless char(k) | #(G), the so-called modular case.  In that
case, I haven't worked out the details, but I think the tensor product
of finite-dimensional injectives is injective.  The argument uses duality
in k.  In fact, the category is self dual (a *-autonomous category).
On the other hand, I think it unlikely that this is true for infinite
dimensional spaces, but I do not have a counter-example.  There are 
categories, for instance Ab, in which the tensor product of injectives
is injective.  The reason for Ab is that every injective is a direct sum
of indecomposable injectives and the only non-zero tensor product of
indecomposable injectives is Q tensor Q = Q.

An Introduction to n-Categories
John C. Baez

An n-category is some sort of algebraic structure consisting of objects,
morphisms between objects, 2-morphisms between morphisms, and so on up
to n-morphisms, together with various ways of composing them.  We survey
various concepts of n-category, with an emphasis on `weak' n-categories,
in which all rules governing the composition of j-morphisms hold only up
to equivalence.  (An n-morphism is an equivalence if it is invertible,
while a j-morphism for j < n is an equivalence if it is invertible up to
a (j+1)-morphism that is an equivalence.)  We discuss applications of
weak n-categories to various subjects including homotopy theory and
topological quantum field theory, and review the definition of weak
n-category recently proposed by Dolan and the author.

At the 64th PSSL at Braunschweig, I gave a talk about cartesian closedness
of exact completions with an intention to cover equilogical spaces in the
sense of Dana Scott (see D.S.Scott, A New category? Domains, Spaces and
Equivalence Relations, preprint 1996). Unfortunately, Peter Johnstone
found a flaw in my argument. I would like to announce the following result
which covers equilogical spaces:

Theorem: Let C be an infinitary extensive category. Then its exact
completion ex(C) is cartesian closed iff C is weakly cartesian closed.
Moreover, the embedding C-->ex(C) preserves exponentials.

	Third Special Australasian Issue of Theoretical Computer Science
	----------------------------------------------------------------

			Call for Papers
			----------------

The recent CATS'97 meeting in Sydney endorsed arrangements for a third
special issue of the journal "Theoretical Computer Science" (TCS)
devoted to work by anyone connected to Australia or New Zealand in
some way.  This includes expanded versions of papers presented at
CATS'97, or some other recent and relevant conference in Australia or
New Zealand, or papers of which at least one author is resident in
Australia or New Zealand.

The submission criteria are the same as for normal TCS papers, and can
be found in any recent issue of TCS.  If it should happen that there
are more acceptable papers than can appear in the special issue, then
the excess will appear in a regular issue of the journal.  

The deadline for submissions is 31st May, 1997. Papers should be submitted to:

James Harland

LAST CALL FOR PREREGISTRATION

INTERNATIONAL CATEGORY THEORY MEETING (CT97)

July 13-19, 1997

University of British Columbia
Vancouver, Canada

The conference arrival day is Sunday July 13 with a reception 6-9pm in the
Fireplace Lounge of Walter Gage Towers on the UBC campus. The scientific 
program will begin Monday morning July 14 at 9am in Angus 104 and will finish 
on Saturday July 19 at the end of the morning session (12:30pm).

On Wednesday afternoon July 16 there will be a Vancouver city tour followed
by a dinner cruise with Harbour Ferries. Pickup time will be 2:30pm in
front of Gage Towers.  On Friday evening there will be a banquet starting
at 7:30PM.


PREREGISTRATION

If you plan to attend the conference and have not preregistered, or if
you would like more information to enable you to decide whether to
attend, then please preregister as soon as possible.

To preregister, and thus receive future announcements as well as a
registration form and a housing form please send e-mail to johnm@math.ubc.ca
with subject `preregistration'.  Please provide your name and a postal address
in the body of the message.

HOUSING DEADLINE

Accomodation is available on the U.B.C. campus in a block of rooms being held
for CT97 until June 13, one month before the starting date of the conference.
On June 13 all rooms from our block which have not been individually reserved
will be released to the public for reservation.  After this time one can still 
request space on an individual basis, but the outcome is less certain,
especially since a major music festival begins in Vancouver on July 18.


If you think that you may attend but are not sure yet, then you may find
it advisable to reserve a room since this can be done by email on the 
housing form and for the single rooms with shared washroom it does not
require a deposit.

If you have preregistered but have misplaced your room reservation form,
then please send email to johnm@math.ubc.ca with the subject Housing 
and a room reservation form will be sent to you.

TALK DEADLINE

If you wish to give a talk and have not yet informed the organizers, then
please let us know of your intention by May 31 by sending email to 
johnm@math.ubc.ca  including a title, if possible.  Abstracts should be sent
to stone@math.ubc.ca by June 10.

There may be parallel sessions on some afternoons.  The total number of
speakers may have to be limited as well.

PREREGISTRANT LIST

For your information a list of those who have preregistered as of May 16
is attached.  This list is presented roughly in the order in which 
preregistrations were received.  If your name is not on the list and
you would like it added, then please follow the procedure listed under
PREREGISTRATION above.

From: Thomas Streicher <streicher@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>

In a paper circulated since end of last year Dana Scott has proposed a category
PEQU of algebraic lattices with partial equivalence relations as objects and
equivariant Scott continuous maps as morphisms. One nice thing about PEQU is
that Scott has shown it to be equivalent to the category EQU of T_0 spaces
with (total) equivalence relations and equivariant continuous maps.
It has been shown (by students of Scott) that PEQU is not even well-powered 
despite being regular and locally cartesian closed 
(in particular, it is a logos and thus a model for FOL).
 
If one considers $\omega$-PEQU, the category of $\omega$-algebraic lattices
with partial equivalence relations as objects and equivariant Scott continuous
maps as morphisms, then it can be shown easily to be equivalent to 
PER(P $\omega$), the category of pers over the good old P $\omega$ model of 
lambda calculus, which embeds into Ass(P $\omega$), the category of assemblies
over P $\omega$ and finally into RT(P $\omega$), the realisability topos over
P $\omega$. All these full inclusions are reflective. This realisability model
has been studied by Wesley Phoa in his Thesis (1990) and in his paper 

     "Building Domains from Graph Models" (MSCS, 1992).
 
The reason for the equivalence of $\omega$-PEQU and PER(P $\omega$) is that
any $\omega$-algebraic lattice L is contained in P $\omega$ via an inflationary
retract e : L -> P $\omega$ , p : P $\omega$ -> L. Now if R is a per on L then
P $\omega$ may be endowed with the per 
 
       e[R] := { (e(x),e(y)) | x R y }
 
and the pair e,p of equivariant Scott continuous maps establishes an 
isomorphism between (L,R) and (P $\omega$ , e[R]).
 
This observation does not hinge on countable cardinality. For any cardinal 
$\kappa$ we may consider $\kappa$-PEQU (where the bases of the algebraic 
lattices are required to have cardinality less or equal $\kappa$) 
and show it to be equivalent to PER(P $\kappa$) by the same argument as above.
The reason why this is possible is that any infinite set M contains 
List(M) x M as a retract and therefore can be endowed with a graph model 
structure -- as emphasised by Scott.
 
The benefits of this (simple) observation are the following

(1) $\kappa$-PEQU does not admit a generic (regular) mono 
    (= weak s.o. classifier) as for any partial combinatory algebra A 
    the category PER(A) does not admit such 
    (as each homset has cardinality less or equal |A| and 
     there are 2^{|A|} (regular) subobjects of (A, \Delta(A)))
    but, never mind, the required weak / strong classifiers live in
    Ass(A) / RT(A) , respectively
 
(2) Phoa already has started to investigate SDT in PER(P $\omega$),
    one may take as a dominance (S , \Delta(S)) where S is Sierpinski space
    together with [t] : ({*} , \Delta({*})) -> (S , \Delta(S)) 
    where t(*) = \top.
    The same may be taken as a dominance for PEQU without any size 
    restrictions.
 
Anyway, PEQU appears as an amalgamation of ALL realisability models over
graph models of all size. Assuming a Grothendieck universe U we may consider
(the fairly big) graph model  P U  appearing most naturally so 
as we have List(U) x U \subseteq U. 
Thus PER(P U) contains PEQU, i.e. EQU, when one restricts the underlying
algebraic lattices / T_0 spaces of PEQU / EQU to live in universe U. 
But notice that (P U , \Delta(P U)) lives outside this PEQU.
Anyway, PER(P U), Ass(P U), RT(P U) appear as the appropriate models of logic
in which to study Scott's recently proposed categories. 
>From the point of view of mathematical practice, however, the restriction to 
cardinality $\omega$ does not seem to be too restrictive as most spaces in
"real" mathematics have a countable base (e.g. separable metric spaces).

From: Kristoffer Hogsbro Rose <krisrose@brics.dk>

Dear Category Theorists,

Please find enclosed a copy of the TRAILER for a new version of Xy-pic.
I hope you will find it useful.  Notice that DIKU has discontinued my
ftp directory, so the principal home of Xy-pic is now at brics.dk.

Sincerely,
            Kristoffer H. Rose

=======================================================================
     ANNOUNCING the Xy-pic version 3.4 DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE
=======================================================================

This is to announce a RELEASE of the DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE:

			      Xy-pic 3.4

This is a maintenance release where a few more bugs of the previous
major release of Xy-pic 3 have been eliminated and a few things have
been added...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
				GENERAL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic is a package for typesetting a variety of graphs and diagrams
with TeX.  Xy-pic works with most formats (including LaTeX, AMS-LaTeX,
AMS-TeX, and plain TeX), in particular Xy-pic is provided as a LaTeX2e
`supported package' (following the `CTAN LaTeX2e bundle' standard).

Further specifics of the package are in the distribution README file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
				 NEWS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic version 3 was a thorough rewrite of the prior major version,
version 2 (last version 2 release was release 2.6; several beta-test
releases of version 3, numbered 2.7-2.12, were made available to
users).  However, full backwards compatibility is maintained (except
for the unavoidable but fully documented obscure cases).

Release 3.4 fixes the following problems remaining in release 3.3:

* \txt and v2 arrow commands now work again, even first in matrix entries!
* Tiling patterns are functional again!
* PostScript frames have the right shape again! 
* The [F**] `enhance' modifier is now useful, even without PostScript!
* Using Xy-constructions with & inside other table constructs possible!
* Improved non-PostScript curved dashing!
* `Illegal parameter number in definition of \lastprentry@@' bug fixed!

as well as the usual collection of minor fixes in code & documentation
(all described in the ChangeLog file of the source distribution).

Thanks to J|rgen Koslowski, Clemens Beckstein, G. Allen Morris III,
Chris L. Skeels, and Peter Selinger, for your bug reports (and to
David Carlisle for reminding us of LaTeX2e's \AtBeginDvi mechanism,
and last but not least to Karl Berry for releasing web2c-7.0 so we
won't have to get `out of memory' errors any more and gee are we proud
of being the only macro package mentioned in texmf.cnf :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
			      AVAILABILITY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic can be retrieved through the World Wide Web Xy-pic `home pages':

  URL:			http://www.brics.dk/~krisrose/Xy-pic.html
  URL:			http://www.mpce.mq.edu.au/~ross/Xy-pic.html

as well as by anonymous ftp from

Check the README file in each location for specifics.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
			   HISTORY & CREDITS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first public release (version 1.40) of Xy-pic was created by
Kristoffer H. Rose, DIKU, U of Copenhagen (now BRICS, U of Aarhus) and
distributed via Usenet on December 19, 1991.  (Version 3.3 was released
on December 19, 1996 because this was the fifth anniversary of Xy-pic.)
This quickly became Version 2 of which version 2.6 was the most stable.

The rewrite that became version 3 is a continued collaboration with
Ross Moore, Macquarie U, Sydney, initiated through a visit to Macquarie
(Jan-May 1994 supported by the Australian Research Council, Macquarie
University, and using donated DEC equipment).

Xy-pic is Copyright (c) 1991-1997 by Kristoffer H. Rose and 1994-1997
by Ross Moore under GNU COPYLEFT which means that you can use the
package for any purpose but if you provide the macros or any code
derived from them to a third party then you are obliged to include the
entire Xy-pic package (full details in the file COPYING).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	  This is the end of the announcement.  Enjoy Xy-pic!

         RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
                     

The School of Computer Science, broadly grouped into areas of Theory of
Computation, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering, offers
a number of PhD studentships each year.

The Theory of Computation group concentrates on the development of
logics and semantics for programming languages. The overall aim is to
provide intuitive conceptual tools for the everyday practice of
programming.  Within this framework, the activities range from abstract
mathematics to issues of implementation and software development.
Current research projects include probabilistic computation and model
checking, semantics for concurrent systems, observation logics, exact
real number computation, semantics for databases, (linear) functional
programming, type systems for optimization of programs, and automated
deduction.

Current members of the Theory group are: Dr Valeria de Paiva, Professor
Achim Jung, Dr Marta Kwiatkowska, Dr Eike Ritter and Dr Mark Ryan.
There are also two Research Fellows (Dr Natasha Alechina and Dr Neil
Ghani) and 9 PhD students associated with the group, of the total of 30
in the School.  Possible topics for research include, but are not
restricted to:

   Probabilistic and stochastic systems    
   Software verification
   Semantics for concurrency
   Extensions to the relational database model (theory and implementation)
   Semantics of object-oriented languages   
   Linear abstract machines
   Type systems for imperative and OO programming
   Machine-assisted reasoning
   Categorical models of rewriting
	
Applicants should possess a good honours degree (equivalent to an upper
second class degree in a UK university) in Mathematics or Computer
Science, or a closely related title.  Applicants willing to undertake
building software systems as part of their research are particularly
encouraged.

Informal enquiries can be directed to any member of the group:

With J.Adamek, we have proved that the category of topological spaces is
weakly cartesian closed. Hence its exact completion is cartesian closed
(following the result I announced on May 15).

From: Dr. Reinhard B/rger (Prof. Dr. Pumpl^nn) <Reinhard.Boerger@FernUni-Hagen.de>

Michael Barr mentions the example Ab. There is even an easier reason 
why tensor products of injectives in Ab are injective and it even 
injectivity of one factor suffices: Injecitive abelian groups 
coincide with divisible abelian groups and a tensor product is 
divisible if one factor is. This holds in a more general sitution, 
e.g. for modules over a principal ideal domain. It might be worthwile 
to look for a general (categorical) reason for this phenomenon.
