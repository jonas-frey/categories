Intuitionism's Limits: if C is a category sufficiently complex to
demonstrate that some C-arrow f:a-->b is monic and B is a subcategory
of C containing just f (and the requisite identity arrows), do we
still know that f is monic? Should we? (Or, in other words, which
view *should* dominate: Intuitionism, Realism, the category
theoretic...?) What if C is something (semi?)fundamental like a
category of all sets and functions, or a category of categories?

I suppose the answer is that monicity is relative to a category,
but what supports this as a claim? And doesn't it seem to contradict
the reasonable realist claim that we can somehow know f in B to be
monic? (Or am I missing something straightforward: that properties
can be granted to f by its relationship to C via an inclusion functor?)

This goes to the issue of the adequacy of category theory as a foundation
in more than the simply technical sense.

(I could be using the term "realism" incorrectly too: I take it to be
a positon, in maths at least, that mathematical entities can
have collections of properties beyond the constraints of a given
theoretical context.)

It seems to me that category theory takes the sensible viewpoint that
mathematical entities (e.g. objects and morphisms) only become
interesting through their relationship with other entities.  Every
arrow looks just like every other arrow if we consider it in
isolation.  Every arrow in a category C is an image of the what James
Dolan calls the "walking arrow" --- the nonidentity morphism in the
free category C0 on a single morphism --- under some functor F: C0 ->
C.  Studying an arrow in isolation is just like studying the walking
arrow, which is completely dull.  The fun begins only when we have a
bunch of arrows and start composing them.

This is one reason why I think n-category theory should be useful in
physics problems like quantum gravity, where it only makes sense to
speak of where or when an event occurs relative to other events, not
with respect to some spacetime manifold of fixed geometry.  For
some of the technical apsects of how this might go, see:

John Baez and James Dolan, Higher-dimensional algebra and topological
quantum field theory, Jour. Math. Phys. 36 (1995), 6073-6105.

Louis Crane, Clock and category: is quantum gravity algebraic?,
J. Math. Phys. 36 (1995), 6180-6195.  

These both appeared in a special issue on diffeomorphism-invariant 
physics.

To William James,

  You must be using a non-standard (philosophical?) definition of
"monic", since it is obvious using the standard (mathematical)
definition that a monic remains a monic in any subcategory containing
it (to get unnecessarily technical, because it's given by a
universally quantified Horn sentence). Could you tell us your
definition?

  (For the record: f: A -> B  is monic iff for all  x,x':X -> A  it 

                    x    f          x'   f
is the case that  X -> A -> B  =  X -> A -> B  implies  x = x'.)

If  a  and  b  are *two* objects, then, in the category consisting solely of
those two objects, their respective identity maps, and one further map from
 a  to  b  (and nothing more), that map is both monic and epic.  Once embedded
in another category, however, that map may easily fail to remain monic, may
easily fail to remain epic, may remain one but not the other -- there's no
telling.  And if  a = b  instead, and  f  and the identity on  a  are the
only *two* maps there are, then clearly  f  *may* be idempotent, hence neither
monic nor epic; then again,  f  *may* be involutory, hence a true isomorphism.

I think true realism requires that one pay strict attention to the definitions,
refraining from free-associations with the vibrations of the terms defined.

Cheers,

-- Fred

Whoops! The question is trivialised by using monicity as the relevant
property. Reconsider it in terms of say f as an isomorphism, or of
f holding some property in C that B lacks the resources to demonstrate.

I'm thinking aloud on this question: constructive maths should say that
of f in B there is no demonstration forthcoming, so judgment will be
withheld on whether or not f has the property; a category theorist might
say that category theory does not dwell on elements and that, in context,
B is no different from any isomorph of 2, so there positively is no
further property of f to be had other than that which can be
demonstrated in any isomorph of 2. This is more than Intuitionism will
allow.

Might I, then, go on to say that the philosophies of constructive
mathematics and category theory really are different?

Constructive mathematics is a philosophy. Category theory is not.
The question doesn't even type-check.

Of course they're different.

Does category theory, being mathematics, have no associated philosophy?

(I grant you the original question would have been more recognisable
 given better use of language: "...philosophies of constructive
 mathematics and *of* category theory...")

Any philosophy category theory may have would have at its core, I think,
the notion that mathematical objects are known *not* in isolation but
in the context of their comrades.  The group of rational integers,
accompanied *only* by its identity map, and the Thom space of the
tangent bundle of some exotic manifold, accompanied once again *only*
by its identity map, are, as categories, indistinguishable.

Plucked out of their original contexts, there is no longer any social setting
where one can find any difference between them that really *makes* a
difference.

According to some other views of mathematics, the group of rational integers,
that particular Thom space, the real number {pi}, and my current left shoe,
all have unique mathematical personalities that let them be "obviously"
distinguished one from another, without any reference even to what I would
call their "natural ambient environments".

>From my perspective, admittedly that of a categorist, these views result
from a simple failure to recognize that what passes for the "intrinsic
structure" of a mathematical object is in fact nothing more (nor less)
than a clear understanding of its relations with its mates, of roughly
similar character, in some category (that "went without saying") they all
jointly inhabit -- even the phrase "roughly similar character" is justifiable
*only* by virtue of the fact that they *do* all inhabit some same category.

I hope I'm actually making myself clear, and not just preaching to the converted.

Philosophy is the love of wisdom; type-checking is not.

Of course category theory has its philosophy. To me it's "all things are
connected" - you cannot fully describe anything purely in itself but only
by the way it connects with others. Category theory makes the connections
explicit (as morphisms) and then characterizes things by their universal
properties.

The philosophy plays a real role in categorical practice: for instance, in
the idea that isomorphism between objects is more important than equality,
which is not something that can be meaningful just in terms of the formal
mathematics.

The philosophy also yields a criterion for evaluating the theory: Is
categorical structure adequate for describing the connections that we
actually find? The strength of the categorical view of "connection
structure" is amply confirmed by the power of the universal properties it
can express (compare it with, say, graph theory); but if it does fail us
anywhere, how might it advance beyond its present formalization? (There is
already a plausible answer here: topology has a different way of describing
the connections between a point and its neighbours, and the categorical and
topological approaches combine to make topos theory.)

I hesitate to try to reduce the philosophy of constructive mathematics to a
single pithy phrase, not least because there are different schools of
constructivism with apparently different philosopies. I shall therefore
duck the question of comparing "the philosopies of constructive mathematics
and category theory", but I don't believe it's a meaningless one.

Steve Vickers.

I'm afraid, William, that this presumed association of mathematics and
philosophy is actually a bit of a sad romance: while some philosophies
do like to be associated with mathematics, mathematics (it doesn't
even have a proper plural) mathematics, most of the time, can't care
less.

While philosophy spends a lot of time defining itself and its
relationship with the world, mathematics tends to be a kind of work
some people like to do, taking up the world whichever way it comes to
them: as a model of a process, as a game of signs or pictures, as a
funny language shared between them and theri colleagues... Most
mathematicians just smirk not only on philosophy, but even on category
theory, or anything else deeply concerned with its own identity. They
just like to solve their problems, and sometimes solve other people's
problems, thereby gaining everyone's respect and admiration.

At least, that's the way I have seen it. Perhaps it helps with your
questions a bit.

	(I grant you the original question would have been more
	recognisable given better use of language: "...philosophies of
	constructive mathematics and *of* category theory...")

Your original question was "Which view should dominate?", where "the
category theoretic view" was one of your options.  (You had several
questions but this one seemed the most central.)

If you are asking whether the primary expression of structure should be
in terms of relations between elements or transformations of objects,
then I would answer this as follows.

The analogous question for physics is whether energy and matter consist
of particles or waves.  The consensus in physics today is that both
energy and matter can be viewed more or less equally accurately, if not
equally insightfully, as either particles or waves.  Which offers more
insight depends on the circumstances.

The corresponding position for mathematics would be that structure can
be expressed more or less equally well in elementary or
transformational terms, and that which approach gives more insight
depends on the circumstances.

The extent to which this is not the consensus in mathematics today is
less a reflection on either approach than on the conceptual health of
mathematics relative to that of physics.

William James answered his own question when he asked:

  Does category theory, being mathematics, have no associated
  philosophy?

Yes, category theory is mathematics. Therefore its associated
philosophy is whatever philosophy one chooses to associate with
mathematics.

As for the latter, Dusko provided a pretty good answer. I would modify
it only to reflect that mathematics (which, as always in the absence
of a qualifier, means pure mathematics) is a subject matter. Most
mathematicians are sufficiently confident about their subject matter
that they feel no need for a semantics, much less a stated philosophy.
(Yes, it has been notoriously difficult to define intensionally, but
that's not special to mathematics. What's the subject matter of
physics? If either mathematicians or physicists were -- using Dusko's
language -- to spend a lot of time defining their subject, there never
would have been much mathematics or physics.)

Steve thinks that the existence of a philosophy of category theory is
an "of course". In one of the public meanings of the word "philosophy"
he's certainly correct but not, I think, in the sense that would
include something like constructivism. (The public meaning in question
has even less than type-checking to do with either love or wisdom.
Well, maybe it has something to do with love.)

May I suggest that the applied mathematician may have a very different
understanding of category theory from the mathematician. Steve says
that category theory is "all things are connected". But that's an
article of faith for almost any mathematician. He goes on to say, "you
cannot fully describe anything purely in itself but only by the way it
connects with others." This assertion about what "you cannot" do
sounds like it could be a good way of describing *applied*
mathematicians.

To begin with, Eilenberg and Mac Lane defined categories in order to
define functors and they defined functors in order to define natural
transformations. Immediately it was noted that a new tool existed to
pin down -- in a formal way -- how it is that some of the all things
are connected. It should be noted that categories -- and more to the
point, functors -- have always been considered tools for studying the
subject matter of mathematics. Tools, not the subject matter itself.

I am on record that the language of categories began to become
respectable when Frank Adams was able to count the number of
independent vector fields on each sphere using a construction that
quantified over functors: it produced an n-ary transformation on the
K-functor for every n-ary endofunctor on the category of finite
dimensional vector spaces (which he assembled into what are now known
as the Adams operations).

One of the better successes since then has been the use of categories
in finding connections between various foundational systems. Because
some of these systems are constructivist it has apparently caused some
to think that categories are intrinsically constructivist.  Strange.

There's another important aspect of category theory. Most categories,
in the beginning at least, were categories that naturally arose from
existing branches of mathematics. Some of these categories, though,
had never been lived in before they were invented as categories.  Joel
Cohen named one of these the "Freyd Category" (named not after Peter
but Jennifer): its an abelian category whose full subcategory of
projectives is the stable-homotopy category; all the other objects
have no easy description; the category can be described as the target
of the universal homology theory. But a much better example is in
Serre's dissertation. This work, hailed by many as the single most
substantive dissertation ever written, contends with the two abelian
categories that result when one starts with the category of abelian
groups and identifies with the zero group all finite groups in one
case, or all finitely generated groups in the second case.  Most
remarkably, Serre did all this without using category theory. (The
fact that the first non-trivial construction of a category occured
without benefit of category theory must be reckoned an embarrassment
for category theorists.)

But in recent applications I think a very different type of question
is being asked: "Is it possible that there is a category in which
... can take place?"  These questions are at the heart of many
approaches to programming semantics. And they are at the heart of many
of the uses of categories in theoretical physics. But the first
serious example came, in fact, a long time ago. In the late 60's
Lawvere's approach to differential geometry asked just this type of
question. Elementary topoi made their first appearance as just a
preliminary part of the answer.

So what's this all have to do with philosophy? 

Not much, of course.

Dear categorists,

I have recently proved an (E,M)-factorisation theorem 
in the framework of axiomatic rewriting systems:
every derivation X -> Y factorises (up to Levy permutation equivalence)
into a head reduction X -> Z followed by a non-head reduction Z -> Y.

One special difficulty in my case is that I do not define 
the class M of non-head reductions as a category.
So, I need a characterisation of factorisation system (E,M)
without any assumption of categoricity of E or M.
Here is the statement of the theorem I finally proved:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let E and M be two classes of morphisms in a category C.
(E,M) is a factorisation system of C if and only if
the four following properties hold:

1. every morphism f in C can be factored as f=me with m in M and e in E,
2. if e is a morphism in E and m is a morphism in M then e is orthogonal to m,
3. if i is an iso left composable to e in E, then ie is in E,
4. if i is an iso right composable to m in M, then mi is in M.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do not know if this characterisation already exists in the litterature
on factorisation systems. If it does, please send me the reference
to integrate in my paper.

From: Walter Tholen <tholen@mathstat.yorku.ca>

With regard to the message below, it should be pointed out that the history
of factorization systems is almost as old as category theory itself, going back
at least to Mac Lane's "Groups, categories and duality" of 1948 (Proc. Nat.
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 34, 263-267). The paper most often referred to in conjunction
with factorization systems (P. Freyd and G.M. Kelly. JPAA 2 (1972) 169-191)
  requires the classes E and M to be closed under composition, a requirement
that also occurs in many other papers. But that, in the presence of the
conditions 1-4 below, this is a redundant requirement was known to at least
some people at the time.
 The statement below appears explicitly in my Ph.D. thesis of 1974 (as
Theorem 3.11 - even more generally, since I deal with "factorizations along a
functor" there, which give the usual thing if you then consider the identity
functor). But I certainly do not claim to have been the first to observe this.
I am almost certain that the theorem below was known to O. Wyler in 1968 who
has an unpublished paper with H. Ehrbar of 1968 (which he recalls in a 1987
paper in the Cahiers 28 , 143-159). Another often neglected reference is C.M.
Ringel, Math. Z. 112 (1970) 248-266. I would also think that John Isbell ,
J. Kennison, Horst Herrlich, D. Pumpluen and Louis Nel were aware of the
theorem at about that time.
If all this does not sound clear-cut, then look at Theorem 1.8 in my book with
D. Dikranjan on the "Categorical Structure of Closure Operators" (Kluwer,
1995);
see also the Notes to Chapter 1 which give other useful references.


Best regards to all,
Walter Tholen.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2-Tangles
John C. Baez and Laurel Langford

Just as links may be algebraically described as certain morphisms in
the category of tangles, compact surfaces smoothly embedded in R^4
may be described as certain 2-morphisms in the 2-category of
`2-tangles in 4 dimensions'.  In this announcement we give a purely
algebraic characterization of the 2-category of unframed unoriented
2-tangles in 4 dimensions as the `free semistrict braided monoidal
2-category with duals on one unframed self-dual object'.  A
forthcoming paper will contain a proof of this result using the movie
moves of Carter, Rieger and Saito.  We comment on how one might use
this result to construct invariants of 2-tangles.

Adamek, Herrlich, Strecker: Abstract and Concrete Categories.

Check their Chapter 14! 
AHS 14.6 shows in particular that E and M will be closed under
composition.

     BRICS International PhD School in Computer Science
     University of Aarhus, Denmark

     Announcement and Call for Applications

An international PhD School in  computer science is  opening
at the University of Aarhus.   This is its initial call  for
admissions and grant applications.

The  School is  an  integrated  part   of  the  BRICS (Basic
Research in Computer Science) Research  Centre, and both are
funded by  the Danish  National  Research  Foundation.   The
school admits     10-12 students annually,    and provides a
substantial number of grants  for Danish as well as  foreign
students.

The PhD School wishes to recruit foreign PhD students of the
highest  international standards.  It  provides an excellent
research environment and scientific training facilities, and
aims at making  its PhD  graduates   attractive for a   wide
spectrum of employers -  in private and public  research and
development institutions, both in Denmark and abroad.

So,  if  you  are a  computer science   student and soon  to
complete  at least   four years of   full-time study, highly
motivated  for  a  PhD  study    in a truly    international
environment, please send   us an  application following  the
instructions below.    For   more  details   please    visit
http://www.brics.dk,  or   contact    us    by  e-mail    at
phdschool@brics.dk.

Also, we would  appreciate your passing on  this information
to interested students  and colleagues at your university or
research institute.


BRICS

The  Research  Centre  BRICS  (Basic  Research  In  Computer
Science) was founded in 1994 by the Danish National Research
Foundation at the University of  Aarhus in association  with
the University of Aalborg.  BRICS supports basic research in
Algorithmics, Logic  and    Semantics,  mainly through    an
extensive   programme  of  short-   and long-term   visiting
scientists.


Research Areas

The   core  areas of  the    PhD  School are: Semantics   of
Computation; Logic    in  Computer Science;    Computational
Complexity; Design and  Analysis of Algorithms;  Programming
Languages;  Distributed Computing;   Verification; and  Data
Security and Cryptology.

The school will provide its students with a solid background
in  the     theoretical  foundation centred    around  BRICS
activities.   From this foundation,  the students may either
continue in one of the core areas or venture into areas of a
more applied   or experimental nature  as possible  areas of
thesis specialisation.


Admission Prerequisites and Study Structure

Admission is based  on knowledge corresponding to four years
of full-time studies, including basic courses in programming
and  programming languages,  algorithms and data structures,
computer architecture, computability and mathematics.  (This
list is based on the  current undergraduate education at the
University of Aarhus, and  will be interpreted in a flexible
way.)

The time  allocated for the  PhD  studies is a  further four
years,  where the first   two  years include some  mandatory
course work  and   introductory  research,  concluded  by  a
qualifying  examination,   whereas the  last  two  years are
dedicated  to the  writing of the   thesis, finishing with a
defence. All students admitted to the school will enter this
study structure.  We may,  however, take into account merits
from previous study.

Students   are normally admitted    for  the semester  start
September  1st, but admission  may take place throughout the
year.


PhD Student Grants

The school offers student grants of different types covering
tuition waivers and/or living expenses.


School Start

The BRICS International  PhD School formally started January
1st  1997.  The first   school students will be admitted  by
September  1st  1997.   The  school will admit approximately
10-12  students per year, of which  half  are expected to be
foreign.

From: Charles Wells <charles@freude.com>

Let C be a category and I and I' graphs (or categories if
you prefer).  Define a morphism of diagrams
psi:(delta:I-->C)-->(delta':I'-->C) to be a graph morphism (or
functor if you prefer) psi:I-->I' together with a natural
transformation alpha:delta' o psi-->delta.  This definition
turns Lim into a contravariant functor from the category of
diagrams to C (when C is complete, anyway).

I believe this construction has been familiar since the early
days of category theory, but I don't know a reference and would
be glad to learn of any.

By the way, Barr in SLN 236 (page 52) defines an entirely
different notion of morphism of diagrams which Tholen and Tozzi
develop extensively in "Completions of Categories and Initial
Completions", Cahiers 1989, pages 127-156.  This makes Lim a
covariant functor.

The dual construction (i.e. for colimits) appears in
	Rene Guitart, ``Remarques sur les machines et les
	structures'', Cahiers XV-2 (1974);
and its sequel
	Rene Guitart and Luc Van den Bril, ``Decompositions
	et lax-completions'', Cahiers XVIII-4 (1977);
where further references are also given.

I am writing at the university, with my files at home; but my
memory is that the construction was introduced by Eilenberg
and Mac Lane in 1945, in a paper called something like "On a
general theory of natural equivalences".

The following editorial will appear in the next issue of the Journal
of Functional Programming.  It reiterates our scope, and announces
some changes in our editorial staff.  Our web address appears below,
and e-mail addresses for the people mentioned below appear above.
I look forward to seeing your submissions to JFP!  -- P


			   A HOT opportunity

The Java phenomenon means that programmers that once laughed at
garbage collection and strong typing have started to use it daily, and
this opens up a wonderful opportunity for the functional programming
community.

Bob Harper coined the acronym HOT to summarise much of what functional
programmers have to offer the world: expertise in languages that are
Higher-Order and Typed.  Bob argued for a broad interpretation of
these terms, so that Higher-Order includes languages where objects
contain methods (even though functions are not first-class citizens),
and Typed includes both static and dynamic typing.  By these criteria
Java is HOT, and so are Haskell, ML, and Scheme.

Not all functional languages of interest are all that HOT.
Ericsson is using the functional and concurrent language Erlang
to build phone switches containing hundreds of thousands of lines
of code.  Erlang is a first-order language with dynamic types
(though recent work has added higher-order, and static types are
in the offing).

The key to Erlang's success is similar to Java's: both have thrived by
focussing on an application area, the web for Java, telephony for Erlang.
Those who strive to eke another five percent speed-up out of their
compilers should note another similarity between Java and Erlang: both
achieved their initial success based on byte code interpreters of
modest efficiency (though fast native code compilers for both are
coming along).  We should continue to seek ``killer apps'' for
functional programming.

The Journal of Functional Programming encourages all attempts at
outreach, from our area to others, from theory to practice.  JFP has
published papers on the higher-order and typed aspects of Modula-3,
Algol, and Actors.  We have run (or are about to run) papers on
applications to animation, artificial intelligence, music, protein
analysis, scientific programming, and text processing.  We have had a
special issue devoted to type systems for object-oriented programming,
and another to applications.

As always, we remain a broad church.  Send us your HOT papers, your
application papers, your papers on links to other areas.  Send us
papers about languages typed or untyped, strict or lazy, pure or
stateful, sequential or concurrent.

				 ---

On the home front, there are some changes to announce.

Sad to say, Henk Barendregt, due to pressures of work, has resigned as
an editor of JFP.  However, we are delighted that he has agreed to
remain as editor of our Theoretical Pearls column.  So continue to
send Henk any beautiful and brief candidates for his column, but
please send other submissions to one of the other JFP editors.
Please join us in thanking Henk for his help in founding JFP,
and for his seven years of devoted service.

And please join us in welcoming our new editor, Thierry Coquand.
Thierry brings special expertise in the HOT area of type theory, and
is generally knowledgeable in all things theoretical.  To give Thierry
the warmest welcome, send him a paper today; submission details are on
the inside back cover, addresses on the inside front.  The theory
editor is dead, long live the Thierry editor!

Please also join us in welcoming Simon Thompson as book review editor.
Publishers are keen to give away books in return for reviews, we are
keen to run discriminating reviews, and the reviewer gets to keep the
book.  Let Simon know if you'd like to register as a reviewer, if
there's some book you want to review, or if there's a book you'd like
to see us review.  His address is inside the front cover.

This is also a good point to thank Richard Bird for his continuing
effort as editor of Functional Pearls.  If you have a contribution
that is small, rounded, and pleasant, you'll find his address, too, on
the inside front.  Richard continues to contribute regular columns,
setting a high standard for the rest of us.

And when you do send a paper, just how long will it take to get a
response?  Answer: about three months, on average.  We at JFP have no
patience for journals that sit on papers for years.  The editors all
aim to reach a decision (accept, revise, or reject) on each paper
within four months of receipt, a goal which Simon, Paul, and John met
for every paper processed in the last year, and which Phil failed to
meet just once (by four days).  To achieve this, we ask our reviewers
to acknowledge papers immediately and to provide reviews promptly,
typically within a month.  And we get back to them if we don't hear
from them.

This leads us to our penultimate thank you: to the reviewers who make
the process work.  Without them, our science would grind to a halt.

				 ---

A venerable curse reads ``May you live in interesting times''.

The written word is increasingly viewed on the screen rather than on
the page, and our web site at www.dcs.glasgow.ac.uk/jfp is
increasingly a part of what we do.  Nonetheless, we intend to publish
as atoms rather than as bits for a while longer.

Atoms or bits, journals will remain at the core of scientific
progress.  Their key ingredients are not ink and pulp, nor Latex and
HTML, but writers, reviewers, and readers.  Our final thank you is to
you, for your contribution to JFP.  We look forward to taking, with you,
our next step into interesting times.

-- Philip Wadler, for the editors of JFP
