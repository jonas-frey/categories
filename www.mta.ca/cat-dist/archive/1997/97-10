I've quite a lot to ask, but for this post I'll explain what I've
been about. It's PhD research, but I came to category theory only
in the last year, so let me lay out my background.


1. Context.

The goal is to formulate coordinate systems as first-class entities
in programming languages. But what is a coordinate system, in
computational terms? Some more or less equivalent answers:

Operationally:

* The initial node, or any derived node, in a directed graph where the
edges are coordinate transformation functions.

Denotationally:

* A chart mapping from an open set into a vector space. (Manifold  
theory.)

* A signature or ADT (where it appears as type F):

	Types:
		X ; coordinate tuples
		T ; coordinate transformations
		F ; coordinate systems
		P ; points
	Operations:
		compose: T x T -> T
		invert: T -> T
		apply: T x X -> X
		plot: F x X -> P
		measure : F x P -> X
		step: T x F -> F
	Identities:
		plot(step(t,f),apply(t,x)) = plot(f,x)
		measure(f,plot(f,x)) = x
		plot(f,measure(f,p)) = p
		+ group identities for T

* A functor on a Cartesian closed category with additive structure,
preserving biproducts (vector bases); or more ambitiously, preserving
a set of invariant relations axiomatizing Euclidean geometry.

It's the simple linear case of this last, which I want to develop here.


2. Background.

I got this stuff originally from Arbib & Manes, Freyd, Barr & Wells,
and Pierce; while I bounced off Eilenberg and Asperti & Longo. What
I found I was stubbornly keeping out of the library was MacLane,
_Categories for the Working Mathematican_, and the 1985 _Category
Theory and Computer Programming_, with its nice essays by Rydehard,
Poigne, Pitt et al.


3. Essentials.

The foundations are Cartesian closed categories and abelian categories.

Briefly, CCCs have values, products and powers; while ACs have
abelian group structure on Hom-sets, a common zero, and biproducts;
as well as kernels and stuff which I'm not up with yet.

(I'm also still lost with limits and adjunctions. It's frustrating that
I can work through examples, and still miss the principle. I imagine
I really understood adjoints, a whole lot would snap into focus.)


4. Sketch Synopsis.

(Terminology:
	domain = type = object
	arrow = morphism
	power domain = exponential = Hom-set (in CCCs)
)


4.1. CCC Isomorphisms.

CCC's are held together by domain constructors: 1, x, and [->],
with corresponding isomorphisms:

	A =~= [1->A]			; domains have values
	[M->A] x [M->B] =~= [M -> AxB]	; there are finite products
	[MxA -> B] =~= [M -> [A->B]]	 ; Hom-sets are power domains

[NB! I get the impression that writers use "power domain" in a different
sense. "Hom domain", "arrow domain", "function domain" might all be
better.)

Also

	A x B =~= B x A

for products in general. Products are associative, powers aren't.

4.2. The Field Domain.

To put it to work, assume primitive domains:

	I	 stands for a finite index set
	R	stands for the reals, with the ring structure:

	(+) : R x R -> R
	(.) : R x R -> R
	0 : 1 -> R
	1 : 1 -> R
	(-) : R -> R

(To turn R into a field, we have to break it up as a coproduct:

	R = {0} + R-{0}

so that we can define

	(^-1) : R-{0} -> R-{0}

but this complication can be left until kernels are opened up.)


R is a module, with a one-element basis {1}, and it's also its
own linear automorphism set,

	R =~= L[R->R]
	r <-> (lambda(.)) r

The vectorial properties, addition and scalar multiplication,
carry over to any domain [A->R]. For [A->R] to be a module,
there must be a finite basis for it. As far as I can tell,
being "finite" only requires that operations (e.g. sum) over
all elements are defined.

4.3. Biproduct from CCC.

Now bring in domain I. Equip it with an equality mapping, the
Kronecker delta:

	(=) : I x I -> R : (i,j) |-> if (i = j) 1, else 0

With the CCC isomorphisms, plus R =~= L[R->R], this can be
expressed as:

	delta : I x R x I -> R : (i,r,j) |-> if (i = j) r , else 0

and we use the usual exponential curry-eval diagram, and a bit of
extra currying, to resolve it to:

	eta : I -> [R -> [I->R]] : i |-> (r |-> (j |-> if(i=j) r,else 0))
	pi :  I -> [[I->R] -> R] : i |-> ((j |-> x[j]) |-> x[i])

This expresses the biproduct (sketch diagram here)

	 eta i     pi i
	R -> [I->R] -> R

with (eta i) and (pi i) as injection and projection sets. The eta's
produce vectors, the pi's take components. In effect they are a
vector basis and a covector basis for [I->R].

We want a name for this category; I don't know what the standard is,
so I'll refer to the domain [I->R] as X within the category, and
X(I) for the category itself.

4.4. Duality Functor

The contravariant hom-functor X(I)(-,R) gives the dual category,
which we could call X*(I) = Xop(I). The hom-functor action is:

	X(I)(-,R):

	A |=> [A->R]
	f: A ->B |=> f#: [B->R] -> [A->R]

In particular, this gives:

	(pi* i) = (eta i)# : [X->R] -> R : x* |-> x* eta i
	(eta* i) = (pi i)# : R -> [X->R] : r |-> r pi i

and

	(eta** i) = (eta i)##
	(pi** i) = (pi i)##

after some fiddling around with [1-> ]'s.

4.5. Chart and Transformation Functors.

Next, suppose we have another category, say P, with its own
copies of I and R as well as a domain E. And suppose there is
an isomorphism:

	f : E -> X
	~f : X -> E

then (as far as I can tell), it defines an invertible functor:

	Chart(f): P -> X(I)

with the action:

	R |=> R
	I |=> I
	E |=> X
	eta i |=> ~f eta i : R -> E
	pi i  |=>  (pi i) f : E -> R

and Chart(f), at last, is what we mean by a coordinate system!


Thirdly, if we have a matrix:

	m : I x I -> R

and require its adjoint to be defined (i.e. it's non-singular),
then

	t(m) = Sum(i,j) ( t<i,j> (eta i) (pi j) ) : X -> X

defines a functor as above:

	Trans(t(m)) : X(I) -> X(I)

The adjoint matrix has to be defined, to preserve the biproduct.
If it isn't, the dual functor won't define a surjection.


4.6 Category: XTFP(I)?

Now let me put together what I think I've got. (If I'm qualifying
assertions a lot, that is because the concept is clear enough for
making assertions, but the hard work is only half done.)

Overall, we have a collection of categories which we can denote

	{Trans(t)(X), I, Trans(t) eta(X), Trans(t) pi(X)}

including the structure

	X(I) = {[I->R], I, eta, pi}

which we first made up (and which remains somewhat special, because
it's the only one for which the eta's and pi's are the columns and
rows of the identity matrix, i.e. Kronecker delta for I).

Make a category of this collection. Its domains will be the categories
in the collection, and its arrows will be the transformation functors
Trans(t(m)). Call this XT(I); perhaps a nicer name would be
Bases(I).

But more, we can include XT(I) in a larger category, of images of
the whole thing. This will be a category of domains P, with associated
chart functors Chart(f): P -> X.

It would be reasonable to call the the category containing XT(I)
and the image of it defined by a single P and F, XTF(I,P) or
Altas(I,P). And the whole gazoo, comprising as many of these as
we care to make up P's, we can call XTFP(I), or LinearGeometry(I).


4.7 Back to ADT's.

One test of whether the construction has gelled, is to match it
against the ADT signature at the beginning. That signature is
what I was originally calling "XTFP", before I started using
categories, and the reason I've gone in for categories was to
impose on it a discipline of function domains and ranges.

The core of the signature is:

	Operations:
		compose: T x T -> T
		invert: T -> T
		apply: T x X -> X
		plot: F x X -> P
		measure : F x P -> X
		step: T x F -> F

With the categorial development, write this as:

	compose : (t1,t2) |-> t1 t2
	invert : t |-> ~t
	apply : (t,x) |-> t x
	plot: (f, x) |-> ~f x
	measure: (f,p) |-> f p
	step: (t,f) |-> t f

But also requiring:

	invert: f -> ~f

The ADT is thus included in XTFP(I); but the latter now has a good
deal more structure, because it also contains R, with addition and
scalar multiplication defined on I x I x ... x I -> R, and all arrow
domains which are isomorphic to it via the CCC and R <-> L[R->R]
isomorphisms.

What's more, if we extend still further, to a category containing
XTFP(I) for all indices I, this larger category (XTFP) is exactly
Vect.

4.8  In Practice

The categorial version of the ADT is nice in some basic ways.
The identities, such as

	plot(step(t,f),apply(t,x)) = plot(f,x)

come out like

	~(t f) (t x) = ~f ~t t x = ~f x

with the cancellation being obvious, where the original is
rather ad hoc.

Considering this as an expression syntax, it's pretty readable.
In fact, this form is what I have, in an implementation of the
original ADT in Mathematica 2.2. I extend the types to lists
or arrays in the types, and the expression syntax then works
for regular hierarchic figures. I build small models in this
XTFP implementation: 3D stick-figure bicycles, fractals, etc.
I think of it as a more elaborate version of LOGO.

Part of what I'm wrestling with, is a way to use Mathematica's
substitution rules to make the t's and f's work _as_ Trans
and Chart functors. This is application of categories (to the
definition of functional programming languages) with a vengeance.

I haven't seen it done quite like this in the literature, but
then I may be missing something in denotational semantics or
typed-lambda, which states it all but states it obscurely.


4.9  Geometric Semantics

A big concern of mine, is that programming languages for graphics
and geometry lack geometric meaning. Because the conventions of
numerical representation are settled _during_ the analysis of a
modelling problem, and _before_ programming begins, the actual
code does not support any shifting between alternate representations;
that is, there's no such thing as change of variable, re-solving
equations for a different variable set, etc.

Bringing coordinate systems into a programming as first-class entities
is supposed to be a first step towards improving the state of affairs.
Now we can see coordinate systems and transformations as functors,
the problem can be seen as, how to keep the language in a form to
which functors can be applied.

The immediate successes in geometric semantics with XTFP(I), are

1. Points and their coordinates are distinguished.
2. Covariant and contravariant vectors are distinguished.
3. Active and passive coordinate transformations are distinguished.


4.10  The Further Prospect.

The basic operation in XTFP(I) turns out to be: substitute for the
eta i and pi i, any equivalent set of basis vectors.

Looking back, it impresses me that we can get all this from:

1. Field structure on R
2. Equality on I

The next thing to go for, is the remainder of tensor analysis.
The compounds

	eta i pi j
	pi i eta j

are arrow-successive; but there is no tensor product defined,
to make

	eta i eta j

meaningful, for instance.


Further, up til now we have made minimal use of structure on I.
But there are some obvious morphisms between XTFP(I)'s, for
different I's.

In particular, if we have I, then we have the lattice of subsets
of I; and these subsets index related spaces, with related vector
bases. E.g. if

	I = (1,2,3,4)

indexes vectors in R^4 = [I->R], then

	I<I = ((1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4))

indexes bivectors. The combinatorics of the I's implies the
form of the cross-product function, that is, how to arrange the
2x2 minors of a matrix {x1,x2} with x1,x2 in X(I). So to speak.

I'm working on a smooth way to formalize this in general. The
essential concept is that there must be some _functor_ from the
category of I's and combinatorial operations, to the category
of the graded subspaces (scalar, vector, bivector,..,(n-1)-vector,
determinant) of X(I). It's one of those cases where one is sure
that someone must have done such a thing already, but one can't
find it in the literature.


4.11 Thanks for Listening.

That's the state of play.

I guess my conclusion on categorial development, is that you can
spend a lot of effort getting to the elements of the area you want
to model; but when you've done it, you have a formalism that's
pretty well purged of ad-hoc assumptions. It's done with the
absolute minimum.

Now, everyone wants feedback on their ideas, and I'm no exception;
but I'm not expecting anyone to review this in detail. What would
help me a lot is any indication that others have gone up the same
route, of combining CCCs or lambda-calculus with arithmetic, to
define vector analysis in the same sort of way.

That's all. Now I'll be hoping to gain some enlightenment from
listening in to your discussions.

In my last mailing, I talked about my attempt to develop vector
spaces from CCC's with finite sets and real arithmetic. Now it's
time for some questions.

(1)

Assume a category with domains I, standing for a finite set; and
R, standing for the reals. If it's a CCC, we can get the biproduct
structure, by currying the Kronecker delta, i.e. the equality function
on I.

Even to express very simple statements about vectors, one now needs
a legitimate way to write _summation over_ I. E.g. if we have a full
set of injectors

        eta : I -> X   where X = [I->R]

we want to write an arbitrary vector as

        Sigma  x(i) (eta i)
        i e I

This is shorthand for something like

        compose : R x R x ... x R -> X

where the R's correspond 1-1 with I. It's the domain I itself
(rather than any element of it) which determines that finite product.

We know what we mean, by summation over I; but it seems to me that
(1) we are relying on induction over I, and therefore on first, last
and successor arrows to I, the whole Peano development; and (2) that
this is not explicit in the CCC definition. Yes, it is stated that
a CCC has all finite products. But to make this formal, we need a
formal means of expressing the inductive step; the equivalent, perhaps
of a FOR loop in algorithms.

Is there a standard way to address this?


(2)

To make the issue more pointed, let's step back from our category,
and name it X(I,R). Now, define a category of finite sets, say Y,
in which I1, I2, ... are domains, and each one can stand in for I,
so that we have X(I1,R), etc.

We would like to say, there is a category V(Y,R), of all such
categories; and define a functor

        V(-,R):

                Y => X(Y,R) : I |=> X(I,R)


We should be able to say that VECT(R) is a proper subcategory of
V(,-R), because each

        f : Y -> Y

maps onto

        V(f,R) : X(Y,R) -> X(Y,R) : X(I,R) |-> X(f(I),R)

But there is more to V(-,R) than that. For one thing, there
will be a unique arrow in V(-,R), expressing summation (or in
general what they call "fold", or APL, "reduce"),

        fold : [RxR ->R] x Y -> [[Y -> R] -> R]

such that

        fold <(+),I> : [[I -> R] -> R] :
                (i |-> a(i)) |-> Sigma(i) a(i)

The fold arrow expresses _reduction by a real binary function, over
an inductable set_, producing a unique arrow in each X(I,R) that
does the job.


Now if this makes me uneasy, it's possibly just "abstraction vertigo".
As far as I can make out, fold is justified iff in Y, each domain I
is equipped with arrows:

        first : 1 -> I
        last: 1 -> I
        next : (I-last(I)) -> I

That means that in Y itself, one can define:

        First: Y -> (1->Y) : I |-> (first : 1 -> I)
etc.

Something is slipping here, and I think its that the notation is
being overloaded when "I" refers both to a domain in Y, and to the
actual finite set it denotes.

It seems to me there much be a well-tried way of doing this, but
my reading into categories in language specification haven't
disclosed anyone spelling it out.


(3)

Now for a major issue. I managed to define my biproduct in X(I,R)
by defining X(I,R) as a CCC, with real arithmetic, equality on I,
_and only that_. Which seems to me a notable finding, and one to
be followed up.

In introducing functors on X(I,R), and further, functors on X(Y,R),
I want to deduce the consequences of X(I,R) being Cartesian closed.
Therefore I want to develop just those functors which map one CCC
to another.

Such functors will only be coherent, so to speak, if they map
values to values, products to products, and exponentials to
exponentials. That is, if they preserve Cartesian closure.

What has been said about the properties of such functors?

I'm following one lead, John W. Gray, _A Categorical Treatment
of Polymorphic Operations_ in _S-V Lecture Notes in Computer
Science 298, Mathematical Foundations of programming Language
Semantics_. Let's just say about this, that the development
of functors between exponential domains is more complex than
I had expected.

Enough for the present.

ABSTRACT

Notions of `operad' and `multicategory' abound. This work provides a single
framework in which many of these various notions can be expressed.
Explicitly: given a monad * on a category S, we define the term
(S,*)-multicategory, subject to certain conditions on S and *.  Different
choices of S and * give some of the existing notions. We then describe the
algebras for an (S,*)-multicategory, and finish with a selection of possible
further developments. Our approach enable concise descriptions of Baez and
Dolan's opetopes and Batanin's operads; both of these are included.

ABSTRACT ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY

by Zhaohua Luo (1997)

It is well known that most geometric-like categories have
finite limits and finite stable disjoint sums. These are
lextensive categories in the sense of [CLW]. We introduce
the notion of an analytic category, which is a lextensive
category with the property that any map factors as an epi
followed by a strong mono. The class of analytic categories
includes many natural categories arising in geometry, such as
the categories of  topological spaces, locales, posets, affine
schemes,  as well as all the elementary toposes. 

A large class of analytic categories is formed by the opposites
of  Zariski categories in the sense of Diers [D]. The notion of
a Zariski category captures the categorical properties of
commutative rings. Many algebraic-geometric analysis carried
by Diers for a Zariski category can be done for a more
general analytic category in the dual situation. We show that
the notion of a flat singular epi developed in [D] can be
applied to define a canonical functor from an analytic
category to the category of locales, which is a framed
topology in the sense of [L1] and [L2]. This topology plays
the fundamental role of Zariski topology in categorical
geometry. 

1. Unipotent Maps and Normal Monos

Consider a category C with a strict initial object. Two maps
u: U --> X and v: V --> X are "disjoint" if the initial object is
the pullback of u and v. If S is a set of maps to an object X
we denote by N(S) the sieve of maps to X which is disjoint
with each map in S. The set S is called a "unipotent cover" on
X if N(S) consists of only initial map. We say S is a "normal
sieve" if S = N(N(S)). A map is called "unipotent" if it is a
unipotent cover. A mono is called "normal" if it generates a
normal sieve. If C has pullbacks then a mono is normal iff any
of its pullback is not proper unipotent. The class of unipotent
(resp. normal) maps is closed under compositions and stable,
and any intersection of normal monos is normal.
Geometrically a unipotent map (resp. normal mono) plays the
role of a surjective map (resp. embedding). 

2. Framed Topologies

Consider a functor G from C to the category of locales. A
mono u: U --> X in C (and G(u): G(U) --> G(X)) is called
"open effective" if G(u) is an open embedding of locales, and 
any map t: T --> X in C such that G(t) factors through G(u)
factors through u. If u is open effective then u or U is called
an "open effective subobject" of X, and G(u) or G(U) is an
"open effective sublocale" of G(X). 

We say G is a "framed topology" on C if an object X is initial
iff G(X) is initial, and any open sublocale of G(X) is a join of
open effective sublocales. If {U_i} is a set of open effective
subobjects of  X such that G(X) is the join of {G(U_i)}, then
we say that {U_i} (resp. {G(U_i)}) is an "open effective
cover" on X (resp. G(X)). The collection T(G) of open
effective covers is a Grothendieck topology on C. We say G
is "strict" if its Grothendieck topology T(G) is subcanonical.

3. Divisors

Here is a general method to define framed topologies. A class
D of maps containing isomorphisms is called a "divisor" if it is
closed under compositions, and its pullback along any map
exists which is also in D; we say D is "normal" if any map in
D is a normal mono. If D is a divisor, a sieve with the form
N(N(T)), where T is any set of  monos to X in D, is called a
"D-sieve" on X. One can show the set D(X) of D-sieves on X
is a locale and the pullbacks of D-sieves along a map induce a
morphism of locales. Thus each divisor D determine a functor
L(D) to the category of locales. If D is normal then L(D) is a
framed topology, called the "framed topology" determined by
D.  

4. Extensive Topologies.

Recall that a category with finite stable disjoint sums is an
extensive category. An extensive category C has a strict initial
object. An injection of a sum is simply called a "direct mono".
An intersection of direct monos is called a "locally direct
mono". The class of direct monos is a normal divisor E(C),
called the "extensive divisor". The extensive divisor E(C)
determines a framed topology, called the "extensive
topology". It generalizes the Stone topology on the category
of Stone spaces. 

For any object X we denote by Dir(X) the set of locally direct
subobjects of X, viewed as a poset with the reverse order. If
any intersection of direct monos exist in C, then Dir(X) is a
locale for any object X, and Dir is naturally a functor from C
to the category of locales, which is equivalent to the
extensive topology. Special cases of extensive topologies
were considered by Barr and Pare [BP] and Diers [D1].

5. Analytic Topologies

An "analytic category" is a lextensive category with epi-
strong-mono factorizations. In the following we consider an
analytic category C. One of the most important notion
introduced by Diers to categorical geometry is that of a flat
singular map. We consider the dual notion. A mono v: V -->
X is a "complement" of a mono u: U --> X if u and v are
disjoint, and any map t: T --> X such that u and t are disjoint
factors through v. A complement mono is normal. A mono v:
V --> X is called "singular" if it is the complement of a strong
mono u: U --> X. A map f: Y -->  X is called "coflat " if the
pullback functor C/X  --> C/Y along it preserves epis. The
main point here is that any pullback along a coflat map
preserves epi-strong-mono factorizations. 

A coflat singular mono is called an "analytic mono". A coflat
normal mono is called a "fraction" (thus any analytic mono is
a fraction). A fraction plays the role of local isomorphism in
algebraic geometry. The class of coflat maps (resp. analytic
monos, resp. fractions) is closed under compositions and
stable. The class of analytic monos is a normal divisor A(C),
called the "analytic divisor". The analytic divisor A(C)
determines a framed topology, called the "analytic topology".
It generates the usual Zariski topology on affine schemes. We
say C is "strict" if its analytic divisor A(C) is strict.

6. Reduced and Integral Objects

The analytic topology can also be defined algebraically, using
reduced and integral objects, as in the case of affine schemes.
An object is "reduced" if any unipotent map to it is epic. A
non-initial object is "integral" if any non-initial coflat map to
it is epic One can show easily that any quotient of a reduced
(resp. integral) object is reduced (resp. integral) (i.e. if f: Y --
> X is an epi and Y is reduced or integral then so is X). 

A unipotent reduced strong subobject of an object X is called
the "radical" of X. It is the largest reduced and the smallest
unipotent strong subobject of X, thus is uniquely determined
by X. An analytic category is "reduced" if any unipotent map
is epic. An analytic category is reduced iff its strong monos
are normal. An analytic category is "reducible" (resp.
"spatial") if any non-initial object has a non-initial reduced
(resp. integral) strong subobject. If any intersection of strong
monos exist in C then the full subcategory of reduced objects
is a coreflective subcategory; if moreover C is reducible then
any object has a radical. 

7. Spectrums

A strong mono is called "disjunctive" if it has an analytic
complement. An object is disjunctable if its diagonal map is a
disjunctable regular mono. An analytic category is called
"disjunctable" if any strong mono is disjunctable. An analytic
category is "locally disjunctable" if any strong subobject is an
intersection of disjunctive strong subobjects. A locally
disjunctable reducible analytic category in which any
intersection of strong subobjects exist is called an "analytic
geometry". 

Let C be an analytic geometry. If X is an object we denote by
Loc(X) (resp. Spec(X)) the set of reduced (resp. integral)
strong subobjects of X, where Loc(X) is regarded as a poset
with the reverse order. Then Loc(X) is a locale with Spec(X)
as the set of points. If C is spatial then Loc(X) is a spatial
locale. Since any quotient of a reduced (resp. integral) object
is reduced (resp. integral), Loc (resp. Spec) is naturally a
functor from C to the category of locals (resp. topological
spaces). The functor Loc is equivalent to the analytic
topology on C. If C is spatial then Spec determines Loc, thus
in this case we simply say that Spec is the analytic topology
on C.  The space Spec(X) is called the "spectrum" of X.

A spatial analytic geometry C together with the topology
Spec is a metric site defined in my paper [L1]. Any object in
C is separated (i.e. its diagonal map is universally closed). In
fact Spec is the smallest separated metric topology on C. The
metric completion of a strict spatial analytic geometry plays
the role of "schemes" in categorical geometry.

8. Zariski Geometries

A cocomplete regular category with a strict analytic opposite
is a Zariski category in the sense of Diers if it has a strong
generating set of finitely presentable objects including the
terminal object which are disjunctable in its opposite. The
opposite of a Zariski category is a strict spatial analytic
geometry, whose analytic topology coincides with the Zariski
topology defined by Diers. We introduce a (simplified)
geometric version of a Zariski category. A strict locally
disjunctable analytic category is called a "Zariski geometry" if
it is a locally finitely copresentable category with a finitely
copresentable initial object. Any Zariski geometry is a strict
spatial analytic geometry with coherent spectrums. Most of
the theorems proved by Diers in [D] for a Zariski category
can be extended to any Zariski geometry. 

9. Examples

(a) An analytic category is "coflat" if any map is coflat (or
equivalently, any epi is stable). In a coflat analytic category
any epi is unipotent, any singular mono is analytic, any
normal mono (thus any analytic mono) is strong, and any
integral object is simple. 
(b) In a reduced coflat disjunctable analytic category, the
notions of strong, normal, analytic, singular, and fractional
mono are the same.
(c) Any elementary topos is a coflat disjunctable analytic
category; its analytic topology is determined by the double
negation; a topos is reduced iff it is boolean; a reducible
Grothendieck topos is an analytic geometry.
(d) The category of locales is a reduced analytic geometry; its
analytic topology is the functor sending each locale to the
locale of its nuclei.
(e) The category of topological spaces (resp. posets) is a
reduced coflat disjunctable spatial analytic geometry; its
analytic topology is the discrete topology.
(f) The category of  coherent spaces (resp. Stone spaces) is a
reduced spatial analytic geometry; its analytic topology is the
patch topology.
(g) The category of Hausdorff spaces is a strict reduced
disjunctable spatial analytic geometry; its analytic topology is
the Hausdorff topology.
(h) The opposite of the category of commutative rings is a
Zariski geometry; its analytic topology is the Zariski
topology.

Those people interested in Tom Leinster's paper on multicategories and
weak higher dimensional categories might also be interested in recent,
closely related work by Claudio Hermida at McGill. I do not think
there is a paper available yet, but he has given talks at Vancouver
and at the recent meeting of the Canadian Math Society in Montreal, so
there are probably slides available.

From: Vaughan Pratt <pratt@cs.stanford.edu>

Toposes and abelian categories are striking for the number of
elementary properties they have in common (monic+epi = iso, mono/epi is
a unique factorization system, etc. etc.) and the paucity of their
common models, namely just the final category.

This observation prompts the following questions.

1.  Are there any other pairs of large and/or useful classes of
categories whose respective theories have so much in common yet whose
models have so little in common?

2.  What can be said of the class of those categories having all the
elementary properties common to toposes and abelian categories?  In
particular does it contain anything other than toposes and abelian
categories?  And if so, does this outcome change when the language is
extended to say second order logic?

To the extent that both toposes and abelian categories share much
pleasant structure, the models of the intersection of their theories,
for a suitable choice of language, would seem to be a nice class in its
own right.

There are several variations on the topic. I'll look first at the
theory obtained by starting with 

  finite completeness,
  coterminator,
  pushouts for pairs of maps one of which is monic,
  pushouts for kernel pairs

then adjoining all universal Horn sentences in these predicates that
hold for both the category of abelian groups and the category of sets
(or, if prefered, hold for all abelian categories and all pre-topoi).
We will see that this theory can be finitely axiomatized and that the
representations of its models into the categories of abelian groups
and sets are collectively faithful. This will be the "first task.
The representation will be done by finding a single faithful
representation into the product of an abelian category and a topos and
using known theorems thereon. By a representation I here mean a
functor that preserves finite limits, coterminators, pushouts of pairs
of maps one of which is monic and pushouts of kernel pairs. (It
follows that a representation preserves epimorphisms, finite
coproducts and images.)

If we expand the theory to include all positive AE sentences it
remains finitely axiomatizable, and the only models are those
categories that are a product of an abelian category and a pre-topos.
This will be the "second task".

After that, I'll add some more essentially algebraic structure so that
we can talk about power-objects using universal Horn sentences and
obtain again the finite axiomatizability and the fact that the the
only models are those categories that are a product of an abelian
category and a pre-topos. This will be the "third task".

Note that each of axioms below is true for both abelian categories and
topoi. Until we reach axiom VAE, all can be turned into universal
Horn sentences if the completeness conditions listed above are turned
into an essentially algebraic theory.

V1) Effective regular category. (Yes this can be stated as universal
Horn conditions on pullbacks and the special pushouts mentioned
above.)

V2)  0 -> 1  is monic.

Note that it follows that all maps from  0  are monic.

In the diagrams below all non-horizontal lines should have arrows
added in downwards direction.

V3) If  A -> C  is monic and 
                              A
                            /   \
                           B     C
                            \   /
                              D

is a pushout then it's a pullback, 

V4)  and so is
                             0xA
                            /   \
                         0xB     0xC
                            \   /
                             0xD.


Note that binary coproducts therefore exist and are disjoint.

V5) If  B -> 0xC  is epic and
                               A
                             /   \
                            0     B
                             \   /
                              0xC

is a pullback then it's a pushout.

Two definitions: let
                        0 x X
                       /     \
                      0       X
 
be a product diagram. If the map to  0  is an iso, I'll say 
that  X  is type-T; if the map to X is an iso, I'll say that
it's type-A. 

Note that (using V2) an object is type-A iff it has a map to  0. The
type-A objects are closed under binary products and coproducts,
subobjects and quotient objects. The full subcategory of A objects is
coreflective, with  AX = 0xX  as coreflector. Most important, it is an 
abelian category.

V5) If the rhombi in
                     A     B
                     |\   /|
                     D  C  E
                      \ | /
                        F
are pullbacks and if 
                     D     E
                      \   /
                        F

is a coproduct diagram, and if all the objects are type-T
then 

                     A     B
                      \   /
                        C

is also a coproduct diagram.

Note that an object is type-T iff every type-A object has a unique map
thereto. Type-T objects are closed under binary products and
coproducts, subobjects and quotient objects. (For coproducts use V3.)
The full subcategory of type-T objects forms a reflective subcategory:
the reflector, T, is defined via the pushout diagram:

                    0xX
                   /   \
                  0     X
                   \   /
                     TX

One now has what's needed to show that the full subcategory of type-T
objects is a pre-topos.

Note that the functor  A  preserves pullbacks and pushouts
of pairs of maps one of which is monic (V4). Add 

V6) T preserves pullbacks.

(It clearly preserves pushouts.)

Only one more axiom is needed for the first task:

V7)  If  f  is a map such that  Af  and  Tf  are both isos then
f  is an iso.

For the second task add:

VAE) For every  X  there's a map  TX -> X  such that 

                    AX     TX
                      \   /
                        X

is a coproduct diagram.

Note that  TX -> X  is a coreflector (making V6 redundant). One can
force the map to be unique by further requiring that  TX -> X -> TX
is the identity map. And note that the type-A objects can not be 
reflective: if  1  has a map to any type-A object the entire category
collapses.

For the third task, I'll add the following structure: functions
on objects P,E,l, r such that  lX:EX -> PX  and  rX:EX -> X  and 

V8)  <lX,rX>:EX -> PXxX  is monic and  PX, EX  are type-T.

I need one more operation, denoted with an upcase lambda, here 
written as  /\.  Given a pair of maps  f:R -> Y, g:R -> X
where  R  is of type-T, then  /\(f,g): Y -> PX  is defined and 

V9> The composition of relations

       /\(f,g)        (lX)'         rX
   Y  ----------> PX -------> EX ---------> X

is equal to 
         f'         g
   Y  -------> R --------> X

(where  '  is being used to denote the reciprocation operator on
relations).

V10) If
             R
         f /   \ g
          Y     EX
         h \   /lX
            TX

is a pullback and R of type-T, then  /\(f,(rX)g)  = h.

Note that in the full category of type-T objects, P  yields
power-objects with  E, l, r  naming the universal relations. (V10 
provides the uniqueness condition.)

In any abelian category the only type-T object is the zero
object, which forces  P=E=0  for abelian categories.

It's routine that both  A  and  T  preserve the new structure. We can
now remove the existential from VAE. Define  TX -> X  as the image of
rX. The third task is finished with:

V11) For every  X  

                    AX     TX
                      \   /
                        X

is a coproduct diagram.



These axioms will, no doubt, be much simplified.

Vaughan points out the many remarkable similarities between topoi and
abelian categories. I've always thought that the most remarkable is
the fact that if one forms the pushout of a pair of maps one of which
is monic then the result is a pullback. The known proofs for the two
cases are remarkably different. When both maps are monic this is known
as the amalgamation property (at least it's so known in the category
of belian groups, that is, groups abelian or not).

It's also right here that a big difference shows up. For abelian cats
the lemma remains true when one relaxes the hypothesis from "a pair of
maps one of which is monic" to "a pair of maps that are jointly
monic." Such a lemma is very wrong for topoi. (For a counterexample in
sets pushout any jointly monic pair of maps from a 3-element set. The
result is a pullback iff one of the given maps is already monic. Such
a counterexample sits, in fact, in any non-degenerate topos.)

Vaughan asked:

  What can be said of the class of those categories having all the
  elementary properties common to toposes and abelian categories?  In
  particular does it contain anything other than toposes and abelian
  categories?  And if so, does this outcome change when the language
  is extended to say second order logic?

The answer to the second question is no (hence so is the answer to
the third sentence).

There is a complete answer to the first question. You won't like it.

For a 1-sentence axiom of pratt categories first take a 1-sentence
elementary axiom, T, for elementary topoi and a 1-sentence elementary
axiom, A, for abelian categories

Then take the sentence:

   T or A.

Sorry. 

Vaughan goes on to say:

  To the extent that both toposes and abelian categories share much
  pleasant structure, the models of the intersection of their
  theories, for a suitable choice of language, would seem to be a nice
  class in its own right.

This strikes me as an interesting topic (and perhaps we should use the
phrase "pratt categories" for what emerges as the right choice of this
class). My first choice for the suitable choice of language would be
the set of universal Horn sentences in the predicates of finite limits
and colimits (where it is understood that we already have the axioms
for finite bicompleteness). Can one prove the expected representation
theorem: does every pratt category have a faithful limit- and colimit-
preserving functor into a product of an abelian category and a topos?

Somehow my first answer to Vaughan's question went astray. He
had asked:

  What can be said of the class of those categories having all the
  elementary properties common to toposes and abelian categories?  In
  particular does it contain anything other than toposes and abelian
  categories?  And if so, does this outcome change when the language
  is extended to say second order logic?

The answer to the second question is no, hence so is the answer to
the third. And you won't like the answer to the first.

Given any two elementary theories, *A*  and  *T*, let  *AoT*  be the 
set of all sentences of the form  "A or T", where  "A"  is a sentence
in  *A*  and  "T"  is a sentence in  *T*.  Clearly every model of  *A*
is a model of  *AoT*  and so is every model of  *T*.

Almost as clearly: every model of  *AoT*  is either a model of  *A*
or of  *T*.

Since the elementary theories of abelian cats and topoi can each be
finitely axiomatized, there's a single elementary sentence common to
topoi and abelian cats whose only models are either topoi or abelian
cats.

                  *           *          *

A few misstatements from my previous post. My attempt to abbreviate
V4  didn't work. I want to say that the diagram is a pushout (of 
course it's a pullback). So it should be:

V4) If  A -> C  is monic and 
                              A
                            /   \

                            \   /
                              D

is a pushout then and so is
                             0xA
                            /   \
                         0xB     0xC
                            \   /
                             0xD.


I wrote:

I should have written:

   And note that the type-A objects can not be reflective unless all
   objects are type-A: if  1  has a map to any type-A object then 
   0 = 1.

Finally (I must be kidding), as it stands the  P-E-l-r-/\   structure
is not properly fixed for abelian categories. Adjust as follows:  /\ 
is defined for pairs  f:R -> Y, g:R -> X  only when both  R  and  Y
are of type-T. Note that the equation in V9 is a directed equality: if
/\(f,g)  is defined then the equality holds. V10 must be modified by 
strengthening the hypothesis to include the condition that  Y  is 
type-T  (at which point the condition on  R  becomes redundant).

Peter's response to my question about categories having all the common
properties of toposes and abelian categories was a very pleasant
surprise.

First I was not at all expecting such a definite answer.

Second I did not expect a representation theorem, especially not such a
nice one as "every such category is a product of an abelian category
and a topos".  This is the converse of the automatic (by Horn) fact
that such a product is such a category, where (for this converse at
least) the language can be taken to be as large as the full Horn theory
common to abelian categories and toposes.

Third I did not expect at all that the class would be finitely
axiomatizable (but on the other hand neither did I have any reason to
suppose not).

Fourth and very nice, unless I'm overlooking something, Peter's
representation theorem implies that my original question (does the
common *elementary* theory allow anything other than abelian categories
and toposes?) can now be answered in the negative.  The elementary
sentence "either all the objects are A-type or all the objects are
T-type" is obviously true in both abelian categories and (pre)toposes,
and rules out hybrids like Set x Ab.  I'd been wondering what
elementary sentence might fail for that example, and Peter's A-type and
T-type constructs lead straight to it.

Minor remarks:

The trick of multiplying by 0 to tease out both the A- and T-components
at once is beautiful, not just intrinsically but also because it
reveals a certain duality between A and T that is not at all apparent
(to me anyway) from their separate definitions.  The actual
multiplication projects out the T part without disturbing the A part,
and then the pushout 

                    AX		(where AX = 0xX)
                   /  \
                  0    X
                   \  /
                    TX

neatly quotients out that surviving A part by forcing the left side
through the zero object while on the right AX->X communicates only the
A part which is therefore the only part that the pushout quotients out
from 0 + X (if that's not too clumsy a way of putting it).

The upshot is then that the AX's form (as an abelian category) a
coreflective subcategory of the whole while the TX's form (as a
pretopos) a reflective subcategory.  That's really beautiful!

The following is presumably the key to proving completeness of Peter's
axiomatization...

>VAE) For every  X  there's a map  TX -> X  such that 
>
>                    AX     TX
>                      \   /
>                        X

...by permitting any model to be constructed directly as a
product of an abelian category and a topos (not even "subcategory"
seems to be needed here, so this is an even stronger representation
theorem than the representation of a Boolean algebra as a subalgebra of
a power set).

>And note that the type-A objects can not be

Whoops, a bug here if I'm understanding things.  Only the T part
collapses, if the category were abelian to begin with then there'd be
no collapse.

>Define  TX -> X  as the image of rX.

This was lovely (getting rid of the E in VAE above).


Some questions.

1.  Can this representation theorem be extended to the full Horn
theory, i.e. any number of alternations of quantifiers?  (Note that my
disjunction---every object is A-type or every object is T-type---is not
a Horn sentence.)  (Now that I look again, I guess the answer must be
yes, since products preserve *all* Horn sentences.)

2.  In a text that treated both toposes and abelian categories, would
your axiomatization be a good starting point prior to doing either?
You could then quickly define an abelian category to be a category of
this general type with the additional property of being strongly
connected.  I don't see right off how to define a pretopos as slickly.

3.  What about bringing in the closed structure?  Might that permit
some simplification of your axiomatization?  For example it looks as
though you could define a T-type object to be one having a unique map
to the tensor unit.  Then you could answer the last sentence of the
previous paragraph simply with "the tensor unit is terminal."
