Here is an Abstract of a manuscript recently submitted, and available on
request. Part of it was presented at the last summer Sussex Category Meeting.

On generation and implicit partial operations in 
locally presentable categories

Michel Hebert (The American University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt)

Abstract. In a locally a-presentable category C, seen as a category of a-ary 
S-sorted structures, we describe the subobjects (resp. the regular, strong
 subobjects) generated by a subset, first in terms of closure under specific 
types of implicit partial operations (IPO), and then in syntactic terms, 
using variations on the concept of dominion. This extends previous results 
from [Hebert, Can. J.Math 93]. The domain of definition of an IPO of arity
 s ->s  is a subfunctor V >--> U(s)  of the appropriate forgetful functor,
 and each limit-closed domain  V determines, in a natural way, a structure P(V)
 in C having as its elements of sort s the (s->s)-ary IPO's with domain V 
(This generalizes the fact that the elements of sort s of the free structure F(s) 
can be seen as the (s->s)-ary implicit total operations in C). The P(V)'s 
for subobject-closed V >--> Us with   | s | < a are precisely the 
a-generated objects (in the sense of Gabriel-Ulmer) of C. Finally we use 
IPO's to give a characterization of the so-called a-retractions, 
which parallels the known syntactic characterization of a-pure morphisms.
	The point of view adopted in this paper is the one of the algebraist or 
model-theorist wishing to use the tools of category theory without making
 radical changes in the concrete description of his/her favourite structures 
(in particular without modifying the type). A part of the paper deals with 
the translation problems which arise.

The location:
Located near the equatorial line in the northeastern coast of Brazil,
Fortaleza, the capital of the state of Ceara', lies by the beach between the
Ceara' and the Coco' rivers, in the middle of 570km (360mi) of sandy beaches
of the State's coast. The hightest point in the city is only 30m (100ft) high
and its beach front is formed of sand dunes up to 10m high and coconut trees.
The weather is dry and sunny. A permanent breeze comes from the ocean and keeps
the air clean and healthy while the temperature rests on a nice level year
around. The lack of rain during most of the year, now a blessing for the
visitors, prevented a definitive settlement in the area of Fortaleza until the
middle of the 17th century. At that time, need to assure the hold of the land,
the Portuguese established the "Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora da Assuncao" in the
same place where a hundred years before the dutch had built the
Schoonenbroch Fort. Fortaleza, named after the fortress, has been since then an
important trading center and an artistic and cultural center of the country.

The seventh biennial conference on Category Theory and Computer
Science is to be held in Santa Margherita Ligure in 1997.  Previous
meetings have been held in Guildford, Edinburgh, Manchester, Paris,
Amsterdam and Cambridge.

IMPORTANT DATES:
- 01 Mar 1997, deadline for ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS
- 01 May 1997, notification of acceptance/rejection                         
- 15 Jun 1997, deadline for final version

** ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION GUIDELINES **
- Papers must describe original unpublished research, be written and
  presented in English, they must not exceed 20 pages nor be submitted
  for publication elsewhere.
- Papers can be submitted via an electronic form or by e-mail (see the
  conference URL for details).
- ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF SUBMISSION might be accepted, but should be
  agreed with ctcs97@disi.unige.it no later than 15th FEBRUARY 1997.

SCOPE. The purpose of the conference series is the advancement of the
foundations of computing using the tools of category theory, algebra,
geometry and logic.  Whilst the emphasis is upon applications of
category theory, it is recognized that the area is highly
interdisciplinary and the organizing committee welcomes submissions in
related areas. Topics central to the conference include:

       - Models of computation
       - Program logics and specification
       - Type theory and its semantics
       - Domain theory
       - Linear logic and its applications
       - Categorical programming

Submissions purely on category theory are also acceptable as long as
the applicability to computing is evident.  It is anticipated that the
proceedings will be published in the LNCS series.

I am interested in the following situation: a contravariant functor
adjoint to its own dual, with the unit and counit being the same
morphism, but _not_ an iso.

The canonical example is the contravariant internal hom on a cartesian
(or just symmetric monoidal) closed category, [(_) -> A] for some
object A.

My question is: is this typical, or are there (interesting) examples
of such adjunctions that do not come from exponentials?

Thanks,

Hayo Thielecke

From: Johan Jeuring <johanj@cs.chalmers.se>

The Department of Computing Science at the Chalmers University of
Technology and G=F6teborgs University announces free PhD positions.

The major research topics at the department are programming logic and
type theory, functional programming, cognition technology, and
algorithms and discrete optimisation, but research is also carried out
in a number of other topics. More information about the research at
the department can be found on the WWW on page:

  http://www.cs.chalmers.se/ComputingScience/Research

Most PhD positions are five year scholarships. The PhD student will
spend about 80 percent of his or her time on graduate studies, and
about 20 percent on teaching. Applicants must have an undergraduate
degree in Computer Science with excellent results. The department
tries to increase the number of female employees, and especially
welcomes female applicants. At the moment the scholarships consist of
14500 (19000) SEK per month in the first (last) year. Usually a
foreign PhD student does not teach in his or her first year in Sweden,
and as a consequence the scholarship is of a slightly smaller size.

More information about the graduate programmes can be found on the WWW
on page:

  http://www.cs.chalmers.se/ComputingScience/Graduate

To apply, send us a letter in English, covering=20

e-mail to johnm@math.ubc.ca with subject `preregistration'.  Please provide
your name and a postal address in the body of the message.


REGISTRATION FEE

The conference registration fee is tentatively set at $225(Canadian) if
received before the end of May and $250 if received afterwards.  The final
figure depends on some cost estimates not yet received but will not
vary much (if at all) from this tentative figure.

The registration fee includes a reception Sunday evening, morning coffees,
a midweek excursion, a banquet Friday evening as well as various fees
charged by the University (e.g. meeting room rentals).  Tickets to attend
any of the events will be available at cost for spouses, children, or other
accompanying persons.

Final figures as well as method of payment will be sent to those who
have preregistered.

ACCOMODATION AND MEALS

Accomodation is available on the U.B.C. campus in a block of rooms being
held for CT97 until one month before the meetings begin.  These rooms as
well as reasonably priced student eating places and a pub are all located
within easy walking distance of the talks.

A form for booking rooms on campus will be sent soon to all preregistrants.
For your advance information the costs of accomodation are as follows:

A single room with shared washroom is $33. per night;

A single room with private washroom is $60. per night;

A single/double suite (1 double bed) is $95. per night; and 

A triple suite (2 twin beds, 1 double) is $110. per night.

These rates are in Canadian funds and do not include taxes, which will be
added to the rates quoted.  The accomodation quoted at $60, $95 and $110
includes TV, telephone, kitchenette and private washroom.  Breakfast is
not included, but is available nearby.

Those who prefer to book hotel rooms in downtown Vancouver should allow
20-30 minutes by car to the U.B.C. campus or 40-60 minutes by city bus.
The name of a Vancouver travel agent will be included in a future 
announcement for those wishing to book hotels or tours through a local
agent.

SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME

Abstracts for talks should be sent to stone@math.ubc.ca (or Art Stone,
8942 Ganymede Place, Burnaby, B.C. V3J 1A1, CANADA) before May 1, 1997.

Please include a title and limit the abstract to half a page or less
in length.  Please indicate the amount of time you would like (20, 30 or
50 minutes).  People will not be asked to speak for more time than they
have requested and, indeed, limited time may compel some compression of
talks.  The total number of speakers may have to be limited as well.

SPECIAL EVENTS

A discussion on some topic of general interest will take place on Tuesday
evening July 15.

For those interested there may be hikes (or longer expeditions) organized
to take place on the day (or days) immediately following the formal part
of the meeting.

There is an outdoor Shakespeare Festival in Vancouver from June 10 until
September 21.  Bard on the Beach presents "The Winter's Tale" at 8PM on
July 15, 16, 17 and "Love's Labour's Lost" at 8PM on July 18, 19.  
Bard on the Peak presents "The Winter's Tale" at the top of Grouse
Mountain at 1PM on July 19.  Tickets can be obtained through a travel agent.

The 20th annual Vancouver Folk Music Festival will be held near the
beach, in Jericho Park, on Friday evening July 18, all day Saturday
July 19 and all day Sunday July 20.  This is an outdoor event and
if you plan to go tickets can be bought at the gate either day by
day, or for the entire weekend.

Those interested in contemporary live theatre, sporting events, etc. should
enquire through a travel agent regarding schedules of events or find out on
arrival.  There are fine restaurants available off campus in addition
to the student places on campus.  There are several beaches nearby.

        I think it *is* typical:  if we call the functor in question  F ,
and if we write  J  for the unit object, then we should learn easily that
 F  will just be  [(_) -> F(J)] ,  i.e.,  F(J) itself will serve as your  A .

Here is the abstract of a paper that is now available at my website.
If printing it out is a problem (see below) I can mail copies to
people. - John Baez

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Higher-Dimensional Algebra III:
n-Categories and the Algebra of Opetopes

John C. Baez and James Dolan

We give a definition of weak n-categories based on the theory of
operads.  We work with operads having an arbitrary set S of types, or
`S-operads', and given such an operad O, we denote its set of
operations by elt(O).  Then for any S-operad O there is an
elt(O)-operad O+ whose algebras are S-operads over O.  Letting I be
the initial operad with a one-element set of types, and defining I(0)
= I, I(i+1) = I(i)+, we call the operations of I(n-1) the
`n-dimensional opetopes'.  Opetopes form a category, and presheaves on
this category are called `opetopic sets'.  A weak n-category is
defined as an opetopic set with certain properties, in a manner
reminiscent of Street's simplicial approach to weak omega-categories.
In a similar manner, starting from an arbitrary operad O instead of I,
we define `n-coherent O-algebras', which are n times categorified
analogs of algebras of O.  Examples include `monoidal n-categories',
`stable n-categories', `virtual n-functors' and `representable
n-prestacks'.  We also describe how n-coherent O-algebra objects may
be defined in any (n+1)-coherent O-algebra.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The paper is available in Postscript form on the web at

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/op.ps

The paper is 59 pages long, so this file is rather large.  
A compressed version is available at

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/op.ps.Z

You can download this and then (on most UNIX systems) type

uncompress op.ps.Z

to get the Postscript file.

If you like ftp, you can also get these by anonymous
ftp to 

math.ucr.edu

They are in the directory

pub/baez

as the files op.ps and op.ps.Z

But they require some more axioms. And they don't require

There is some work by John Cartmell. He applied some 
ideas from his thesis --- about contextual categories, 
generalized algebraic theories and dependent type theory. 
The thesis was Oxford, '78, and some of it appeared in the 
Ann. P. Appl. Logic 32 (1986) 209-243. 

Unfortunately, the only reference to the databases applications 
that I can recall just now is: 

Formalizing the network and hierarchical data models --- an 
application of categorical logic, LNCS 240, 1986. 

Thomas Streicher may perhaps know more ?

From: Zinovy Diskin <diskin@fis.lv>

There are a few papers written by mathematicians, they are rather far 
from the hot DB problems. There are several papers written by DB 
theorists, CT is used there as a kind of decoration rather than 
essentially. There are a few works where CT is really employed for
solving real DB problems.

In summer of 1994 Boris Kadish and I wrote a declarative text called 
"Algberaic Graph-Oriented = Category-Theory-Based:
    Manifesto of categorizing database theory "
(its last updated version  can be found on ftp:
//ftp.cs.chalmers.se/pub/users/diskin/mnfst4.*   ),
in which there is a  list of about 30 titles on CT & DB.
The manifesto and other our papers on CT & DB are oriented mainly on DB 
people but can be of some interest for CT people as well. The 
machinery we use is a generalization of Makkai's sketches.

My last effort in the direction "CT for DB"  is the paper "Variable set semantics 
for generalized sketches: Why ER is more object-oriented than OO"
(on ftp: //ftp.cs.chalmers.se/pub/users/diskin/ERvsOO.* )
submitted to  'Data & Knowledge Engineering'.

From: koslowj@iti.cs.tu-bs.de

Hello,

A revised version of my article "A convenient category for games and
interaction" is available from my home page

	http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/TI-INFO/koslowj/koslowski.html

It better substantiates my claim of last year's workshop Domains II
here in Braunschweig that the composition of games I introduced is 
orthogonal to the established composition of strategies.  The abstract
is appended at the end.

If you had trouble in the past reaching my home page, we did find a
faulty entry in a name server last Fall.  If the problems persist, 
please let me know!

%%  Abstract for: A convenient category for games and interaction

  Guided by the familiar construction of the category  rel  of
  relations, we first construct an order-enriched category  gam .
  Objects are sets, and 1-cells are games, viewed as special kinds of
  trees.  The quest for identities for the composition of arbitrary
  trees naturally suggests alternating trees of a specific
  orientation.  Disjoint union of sets induces a tensor product
  $\otimes$ and an operation  --o  on  gam  that allow us to
  recover the monoidal closed category of games and strategies of
  interest in game theory.  Since  gam  does not have enough maps,
  \ie, left adjoint 1-cells, these operations do not have nice
  intrinsic descriptions in  gam .  This leads us to consider games
  with explicit delay moves.  To obtain the ``projection'' maps
  lacking in  gam , we consider the Kleisli-category  K  induced by
  the functor  _+1  on the category of maps in  gam .  Then we
  extend  gam  as to have  K  as category of maps.  Now a
  satisfactory intrinsic description of the tensor product exists,
  which also allows us to express  --o  in terms of simpler
  operations.  This construction makes clear why $\multimap$, the key
  to the notion of strategy, cannot be functorial on  gam .
  Nevertheless, the composition of games may be viewed as orthogonal to
  the familiar composition of strategies in a common framework.

In Leuven, we have studied semantic data-specifications from a
categorical perspective. We have studied sketches as a formalism
for making semantic data-specifications (somewhat similar to the
approach taken by Diskin et al.), and have developed and proved
correct a number of interesting algorithms to decide semantical
equivalence of such specifications. The following publications describe
our work:

data specifications'', accepted for publication in the special
issue of {\em The Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra} dedicated

From: Steve Vickers <sjv@doc.ic.ac.uk>

I am making two papers available as Departmental Research Reports:

   "Topical Categories of Domains"
   "Localic Completion of Quasimetric Spaces"

Both explore the idea of locales (and, indeed, toposes) as "topology-free
spaces". The technique is to work not with frames (point-free topologies)
but with presentations of them, understood as propositional geometric
theories whose models are the points. (But it is normally more convenient
to work with equivalent predicate theories.) Then -

*   the geometric theory already determines an implicit topology on its models;

*   any construction of models of one theory out of models of another
automatically determines a continuous map (or geometric morphism), just so
long as the construction is geometric.

In effect, a restriction to geometric mathematics removes the need to treat
topology explicitly, hence "topology-free spaces". Apparently, explicit
topology is needed to correct the over-credulousness of classical reasoning
principles, though in practice the geometric constraints often end up
forcing one to reintroduce the normal topological arguments in a different
guise.

The two papers test the applicability of the idea in the two areas of
domain theory and quasimetric spaces. Aside from the "topology-free space"
aspects, the papers develop some new results:

"Topical Categories of Domains" addresses categorical domain theory and
replaces the usual classes of objects and morphisms by toposes classifying
them. New general results concerning fixpoints of endo-geometric-morphisms
of toposes exploit their intrinsically topological nature to give a simple
approach to the solution of domain equations. The paper also gives a
summary of the constructive theory of Kuratowski finite sets and
establishes some limitations to the Cartesian closedness of Sets.

"Localic Completion of Quasimetric Spaces" proposes a construction of
locales in completion of quasimetric spaces (using ideas of flatness
deriving from Lawvere's enriched category account), studies the
powerlocales and shows that a limit map from a locale of Cauchy sequences
to the completion is triquotient in the sense of Plewe.

Paper copies are available from me; electronic copies are expected to be
available shortly in the Department of Computing's Research Report series
coordinated by Frank Kriwaczek (frk@doc.ic.ac.uk).

PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC

        64th meeting - first announcement


The 64th meeting of the seminar will be held at the Department of
Theoretical Computer Science of the Technical University in
Braunschweig, Germany, over the weekend of May 10-11, 1997.  The
seminar welcomes talks using or addressing category theory or logic,
either explicitly or implicitly, in the study of any aspect of
mathematics or science.

On Friday, May 9, 13:00, i.e., before the regular seminar, there will
be an official Colloquium Talk by Maria Cristina Pedicchio on

   Exactness and Regularity for Locally Presentable Categories

After that, we would like to invite those who arrive here early to
visit the Herzog August Library in Wolfenb"uttel with its famous
collection of medieval books.  Gotthold Ephraim Lessing used to be a
librarian there.

Braunschweig is located about 60 km East of Hannover and can easily be
reached by car or train.  The closest airport is in Hannover; the
airport bus to the Hannover train station takes about 20 minutes, and
the train from there to Braunschweig takes about 40 minutes or less.
We will send further information on the location of the seminar, along
with details on local travel and accommodation to those who register,
at least a week before the meeting.

From: Zinovy Diskin <diskin@fis.lv>

I'd like to add some general words to the recent exchange of
references on CT \& DB, and apologize in advance for the long reply.

Texts on CT \& DB can be roughly divided into two groups. In the
first one there are papers (papers-I) where a certain categorical
apparatus is applied to a particular DB theory problem, for example,
monads to modeling bulk data types, or the pull-back treatment of
relational join operation, or the functorial treatment of relational
algebra via indexed Boolean algebras and so on. Papers-II are those
which pursue a more fundamental goal of stating an integrated
framework in which DB theory (or its major components) can be
developed.

It may sound strange but it seems that papers-II potentially can be
much more useful in practice. Indeed, it is commonly recognized that
the entire field of software engineering suffers from lack of
suitable specification languages. A particular but remarkable 
example can be found in the concluding report to a recent high-level
workshop (organized by an industry company!) where the abstract
Wittgenstein's philosophy was invoked:
\begin{quote}
... It is clear that the problem of identifying and resolving
semantic heterogeneity in a heterogeneous  database environment is
far from solved, and that the problem itself is still at the stage of
being understood.  ... Wittgenstein said long ago that if an idea was
worth discussing, then it was worth having a language to discuss it.
...Perhaps, one of the most difficult problems in developing
integrated systems is in figuring out what schemas, data, and
application code mean. 
\end{quote}
In this context, what is required first of all is a general language
which allows to specify basic DB theory concepts like database
schema, database state, query etc in a way independent of any
specific data model (rather than a single universal data model
capturing all other data models).

For a DB theorist it seems impossible to speak substantially about
database schemas and database states without a specific description
of what they are: it appears to be a kind of  speaking about
nothing. In contrast, for a category theorist such an abstract
nonsense is a comfortable environment, the focus is to find a proper
compromise between generality and applicability. In this respect
papers-II existing today are not very successful:  the majority of
them are either too abstract to be useful in real DB problems or too
fragmentary to state a proper foundation.

A categorical idea which seems promising in this respect is that of
Makkai's sketches, more exactly, their suitable algebraic
generalization. In Makkai's presentation, generalized sketches is a
framework for managing logic of diagram predicates, the focus is on
their inference. In the DB language, this is nothing but derivation
of constraints on data. However, the core of the DB technology is
derivation of the very data, that is, in the CT language, the focus
is in operations like pull-back, push-out etc. Of course, it is
possible to consider, say, the pull-back property as a diagram
predicate (as Makkai does) but a more natural and DB-useful view is
to treat it as a diagram operation.  Then complex generalized
sketches which involve several marked diagrams must be considered as
complex algebraic terms in the corresponding signature of diagram
operations, and some parsing procedure is applicable. A notion of
generalized sketch over a signature of diagram predicates and
operations can be defined along these lines in parallel to the
ordinary notion of logical theory over a signature of predicate and
operation symbols. (It appears to be a truly graph-based logic in
the spirit of Bagchi and Wells. A preliminary framework of basic
definitions is described in the report "Databases as diagram
algebras: specifying queries and views via the graph-based logic of
sketches"  (on ftp: //ftp.cs.chalmers.se/pub/users/diskin/TR9602/*.ps
).

\bigskip 
I study DB for more than five years. It is a very lively,
rich and mobile world which significantly influences the modern
information technology and culture. However, in the mathematical
perspective DB theory is seen as a small campus of the relational
data model surrounded by a vast savage forest of various notational
and terminological systems without any denotational semantics. In my
wanderings in the forest, CT served as a reliable guide and, at
last, I have composed the following CT-map of DB:

1) Database schemas (including ER-diagrams and the like) are
generalized sketches in one or another signature;

2) Database states are sketch morphisms from schema sketches into
topos-like model sketches built over domains of values and data
objects;

3) Queries against databases are diagram operations, and query
languages are monads over categories of generalized sketches;

4) Databases are Eilenberg-Moore algebras of these monads while
views and refinements of database schemas are Kleisly morphisms.

5) Architecture schemas of distributed database systems are
metasketches whose nodes are generalized sketches and arrows are
their morphisms.

I do not want to say that DB theory is an applied category theory:
as any other advanced engineering discipline, DB is much richer than
one or another formal theory used for modeling engineering  concepts.
Thus, it is more correct to read statements "A is B" above as "It is
useful to view A as B" . Nevertheless, CT-formulation of DB-concepts
turned out to be extremely useful in the theory and even practice of
DB design. In a sense, relations between CT and software engineering
remind those between calculus and mechanics engineering.

Thanks for your attention,
Zinovy Diskin

SCOPE

This meeting aims at a general understanding of the interconnections
and relations between formal systems, ranging from programming
languages for concurrency to logics. More specifically, we consider
methods to compare concurrent programming concepts, such as imperative
programming, logic programming, functional programming, concurrent
programming, object-oriented programming, dataflow, and the various
combinations thereof, on the basis of their relative expressive
power. We also consider associated mathematical formalisms such as
process algebras, Petri nets, modal logics, rewrite systems etc. from
this point of view.

The meeting is mainly intended for active researchers to get together
and discuss their latest results and methods. It is also the final
meeting of the HCM project EXPRESS, which has been active with this
focus since 1994.
