My colleague Walter Mazorchuk has the following question.

Being abelian is a *property* of a category, not extra structure.  Given
an abelian category A, it therefore makes sense to define a subcategory o=
f
A to be an ABELIAN SUBCATEGORY if, considered as a category in its own
right, it is abelian.  Note that a priori, the inclusion need not preserv=
e
sums, kernels etc.

Now let R be a ring and M an R-module.  Is there a minimal abelian
subcategory of Mod-R containing M?  If so, is there a canonical way to
describe it?

Any thoughts or pointers to the literature would be welcome.  Feel free t=
o
assume hypotheses on R (it might be a finite-dimensional algebra etc), or
to answer the question for full subcategories only.

Thanks,
Tom

Hi Tom,

Silly observation, but wouldn't the contractible category consisting only
of M and its identity morphism constitute an abelian subcategory by this
definition, albeit one that is trivial?  It would seem that the question
for full subcategories is more interesting (and harder).

Best,
Josh

A couple of people have pointed out to me - in private, I think - that th=
e
question has a trivial answer (namely, the subcategory consisting of just
M and its identity map).  Sorry.  I probably misinterpreted what Walter
said to me.

This question, as posed, is too easy: Just take M and its identity
arrow.  It will be a zero-object in that subcategory.  There may be a
better question here guiding  Walter Mazorchuk's intuition, but it will
have to require something more than just containing the one object.

Hmm.  I suppose that restricting to subcategories which respect the group
structure on the Hom-sets would be enough to render the problem harder
(the group structure of course can be recovered canonically from the
underlying category, so this merely refines the class of subcategories we
are considering).  I would imagine this restriction would also have more
repercussions for algebra, anyway...

Nowadays when I hear "Never heard of x" my subconscious seems to turn it
into "never heard of Wikipedia."   When five people tell you x is the
answer to your question, merely filing it "for future reference" misses
the point of the answer.  (As one of the five, my examples consisted of
the finite nonempty chains and the finite Boolean algebras, which I
pointed out to Peter gave an example of every finite positive
cardinality, and two for the powers of two.  My mistake was to lump
these examples together under the common rubric of "Heyting algebra,"
which appears to have made what was meant to be a simple answer
incomprehensible.)

As Bill points out, a Heyting algebra is almost the same thing as a CCC
in the case of categories that are posets.  This is exactly the case
when there are finitely many objects (a case where Heyting algebras and
distributive lattices are "the same thing" in the sense that they have
the same underlying posets), and is close to true modulo existence of
joins in the infinite case.  In particular a Heyting algebra needs the
empty join 0 in order to define negation as x->0, whence the negative
integers made a category with its standard ordering is cartesian closed
but is not a Heyting algebra for want of a least negative integer.  More
generally Heyting algebras are required to have all finite joins, not a
requirement for posetal cartesian closed categories.

Apologies for the previous trivial question.  Here is the correct version=
.

(The mistake was omitting to say that the subcategory must contain all
endomorphisms of M.)

*

My colleague Walter Mazorchuk has the following question.

Being abelian is a *property* of a category, not extra structure.  Given
an abelian category A, it therefore makes sense to define a subcategory o=
f
A to be an ABELIAN SUBCATEGORY if, considered as a category in its own
right, it is abelian.  Note that a priori, the inclusion need not preserv=
e
sums, kernels etc.

Now let R be a ring and M an R-module.  Is there a minimal abelian
subcategory of Mod-R containing M and all its endomorphisms?  If so, is
there a canonical way to describe it?

Any thoughts or pointers to the literature would be welcome.  Feel free t=
o
assume hypotheses on R (it might be a finite-dimensional algebra etc), or
to answer the question for full subcategories only.

Thanks,
Tom

This semester I am teaching rudimentary category theory at graduate
level. It is somewhat scary that I should be doing this, but other
faculty members do not seem to do much general category theory.

I have only few students (and they are very bright) but their areas of
research are quite diverse: discrete math/computer science, algebra,
algebraic topology, and functional analysis.

I can plenty motivate categories for discrete math and computer science,
with things like "initial algebras are inductive datatypes, final
coalgebras are coinductive (lazy) datatypes".

I also know enough general algebra to motivate algebraists with
tquestions like "What is an additive category with a single object?".
And we will study algebraic theories as well.

Algebraic topologists are self-motivated. Nevertheless, we'll do some
sheaves towards the end of the course.

But how do I show the fun in categories to a student of functional
analysis? I would like to give him a class project that he will find
close to his interests. The course is covering (roughly) the following
material: basic category theory (limits, colimits, adjoints, we
mentioned additive and enriched categories), Lawvere's algebraic
categories, monads (up to stating Beck's theorem and working out some
examples), basics of presheaves and sheaves with a slant toward
topology. There must be some functional analysis in there.

I would very much appreciate some suggestions.

Best regards,

Andrej

There's still something odd about this question. Requiring the subcategory
to contain all endomorphisms of M of course requires it to contain
A(M,M) as a monoid. But if you don't require it to be closed under
biproducts in A, then presumably you don't require it to contain A(M,M)
as a ring. It therefore raises two questions of "pure algebra":

What conditions on a monoid (with 0) are needed to ensure that it occurs
as the multiplicative monoid of a ring?

Given that it does so occur, can there be several different additive
group structures making it into a ring?

I suspect that a fair amount must be known about these questions, but
the only result I know in this area is one which I quoted in "Stone
Spaces": for a ring of the form C(X), X a compact Hausdorff space,
the multiplicative monoid structure of C(X) is enough to determine
the topology of X (and hence the ring structure of C(X)) uniquely.

On the subject of Heyting algebras, usage seems to be ambiguous
as to whether they should have (and their morphisms preserve)
finite joins.   I suggest that we should say "Heyting lattice"
if they should, and "Heyting semilattice" if not.

More generally, Vaughan said,
 > Nowadays when I hear "Never heard of x" my subconscious seems
 > to turn it into "never heard of Wikipedia."

I too turn to Wikipedia for information on most subjects.  For
example its medical information is far superior to any other
lay source that I have seen.  But I have two reservations:

Authority.  Journalists like to take swipes at it on the grounds
that anyone can edit it,  but in my opinion they over-estimate
the reliability of "authoritative" sources.  A traditional paper
encyclopedia consults only a small number of experts on each topic,
so it's likely to be cliquey.   On the other hand, there are
frequently stories in www.TheRegister.co.uk (online geek news)
about cliques taking over Wikipedia.

Closer to home, the coverage of mathematics is extremely poor in
comparison to other subjects.  Usually, there is just the stark
classical undergraduate definition, with neither advanced
mainstream material nor any constructive critique.   In my work
on ASD, particularly its application to real analysis, I have
wanted to refer to classical sources as a background, but on none
of the relevant topics have I considered the Wikipedia article
to be anywhere near satisfactory.  All spaces are Hausdorff, and
Excluded Middle is a Fact.   I have thought about rewriting the
articles on Dedekind cuts, locally compact spaces and some other
things, but am afraid that my contributions will just be "reverted".

Maybe if other categorists and constructivists joined in too,
I would feel in better company.

No, I don't want knock Wikipedia.  It's a Good Thing, in principle.
And I would like to encourage others to improve the mathematical
coverage.

By the way, there's also PlanetMath.org, in which authors "own"
their articles, unless they have demonstrably abandoned them.

Since I'm here, I would like to point out that there are thoroughly
revised versions of
	The Dedekind Reals in ASD (with Andrej Bauer)
and	A Lambda Calculus for Real Analysis
on my web page at   www.PaulTaylor.EU/ASD/analysis.php

The second of these contains a "need to know" introduction to the
Scott topology, proof theory and the lambda calculus,  ie it is
written with the general mathematical audience in mind.

As George Janelidze pointed out to me, there was an error in what I wrote
yesterday: the multiplicative monoid structure of C(X) determines X, and
hence the ring structure of C(X), up to isomorphism (this is a 1949
result of A.N. Milgram), but it doesn't determine the additive
structure uniquely, since one can take the standard addition and
"conjugate" it by a multiplicative automorphism of R, in the same way
that Steve points out for finite fields (e.g. one could define a new
addition by f +' g = (f^3 + g^3)^{1/3}).

In my understanding of Heyting algebras/lattices/semilattices, excluded
middle fails for the algebras themselves but not for my understanding of
them, where the partial order x <= y in a Heyting algebra is either true
or false with no middle ground allowed.

I have had little luck absorbing the logic of Heyting algebras into my
own mathematical thinking.  I furthermore worry that if ever I were to
succeed my insights might become even less penetrating than they already
are.

On a related note, a careful reading of Max Kelly's "Basic Concepts of
Enriched Category Theory" reveals that it is thoroughly grounded in Set,
as I pointed out in August 2006 in my initial Wikipedia article on Max.
  I gave some thought to how one might eliminate Set from the treatment,
without much success, and concluded that Max's judgment there was spot on.

My feeling about these recommended Brouwerian modes of thoughts is that
they are something like locker room accounts of social and other
conquests: great stories about things that never actually happened, but
which with sufficient repetition convince one that they must surely have
occurred.

The self-evident is merely an hypothesis that is so convenient, and that
has been assumed for so long, that we can no longer imagine it false.
This is just as true for Excluded Middle itself as for its negation.  I
happen to find Excluded Middle more convenient than its negation, but
that's just me and perhaps others have had the opposite experience.

Then there are those who accept neither Excluded Middle nor its
negation, which takes us into the Hall of Mirrors that I always find
myself in when I go down this particular rabbit-hole.

Dear Peter,

A special case is that of groups (with 0 adjoined) and fields. But even
that is hard. In Paul Cohn's book on Skew Fields (p.145 of 1995 edition)
he says "The problem of characterizing the multiplicative group of a
field has not yet been solved even in the commutative case, but there
are some results on the subgroups of fields." (The main result he cites,
one of Amitsur's, says that a finite group G can be embedded as a
subgroup in the multiplicative group of a [skew]field if and only if G
is (i) cyclic, or (ii) a certain kind of metacyclic group, or (iii) a
certain from of soluble goup with a quaternion subgroup, or (iv) the
binary icosahedral group SL_2(F_5) of order 120.)

Even in finite fields F = Z/p, the additive structure is not determined
on the nose by the multiplicative structure. If the group F* has a
non-identity automorphism alpha then (extending alpha to take 0 to 0) a
different addition for the same multiplication can be defined by x +' y
= alpha^{-1}(alpha(x) + alpha(y)). This would be the original addition
only of alpha preserves addition; but then since it preserves 0 and 1,
and 1 is an additive generator, then it would have to be the identity.
An example is F_5, where the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 4
and has a non-identity automorphism that swaps the two generators.

There remains the deeper question of whether you can have non-isomorphic
additive groups for the same multiplicative group.

Regards,

Steve.

Dear Adrei,

May I suggest you to look at the monograph "Lectures and Exercises on Funct=
ional Analysis" by A. Ya. Helemskii published by AMS in 2006, where, I'm su=
re, you'll find a lot of good motivations for students interested in functi=
onal analysis to study category theory.

Good Luck and best regards,

Yefim

Without addressing this particular issue I want to say I appreciate the
phrase in the article: "the explicitly foundational role of the category
Set."  I take it this is Vaughan's?

Various people including Sol Feferman promote the view that if you use
"sets" then you are admitting that you use ZF and not some categorical
foundations.  Vaughan's phrase goes aptly against that:  If you use
sets, then you use sets, but there is no reason it cannot be on
categorical foundations.  He does not say it *is* on categorical
foundations, and that is fine in the context.  He reminds people that it
*could* be.

best, Colin

A student interested in functional analysis presumably knows some about
topological vector spaces in general and Mackey spaces in particular.  He
might be interested in knowing that the full subcategory of Mackey spaces
has a *-autonomous structure.  This means that if M and N are Mackey there
is a topology on the vector space of continuous linear maps M --> N that
makes it into a Mackey space, often denoted M -o N, and that if you let M*
= M -o C, then the canonical map M --> M** is an isomorphism.  There is
also a tensor product @ and the usual isomorphism Hom(M@N,P) =
Hom(M,N-oP).  See
  M. Barr, On $*$-autonomous categories of topological vector spaces.

Functional Analysis was one of the key origins
of categorical concepts and outlook, for example
that the functionals themselves should be collected=20
into a single object (Voltera-Hadamard) leads to
the Hom functor,etc. This was also one of the roads
followed by students in the 1950s, for example
from J. L. Kelley's "galactic" treatment of M. H. Stone's
functor C.  However in North America (as distinct
from Europe) more recent functional analysists
have accepted categorical methods only=20
grudgingly, and hence piecemeal.

On the other hand, students who are not=20
specializing in analysis are often woefully ignorant
of the basics of functional analysis that are part=20
of what every mathematician should know. To combat=20
that ignorance in my Advanced Graduate Algebra=20
course I often devoted several weeks to topics
from functional analysis. It is a source of examples
both interesting and essential.

To begin to try to answer Andrej's question, I=20
rapidly recall some examples, and hope others will
also comment:

The double dual functor on Banch spaces is a
protype example of a composite of adjoints becoming
a monad. The EM algebras for this monoid were=20
computed by Fred Linton, in an exercise that should=20
be better known. It also illustrates the "descent"
principle that C. Houzel cited  couple of months ago
(what I called semantics of structure of a given functor=20
in my thesis) : Objects constructed by a given functor
tend to have, by virtue of that, more structure than=20
originally contemplated in its codomain , hence
a lifted version of the functor comes closer to being
invertible.

As Peter Johnstone just recalled, if we consider
commutative monoids with zero and hom them into the
particular object of reals, the resulting set is "actually"
a compact space whose C-algebra reveals by=20
adjointness that the opposite of the spaces form a full=20
subcategory of the monoids with zero. Again a good=20
exercise, related to Kelley's "square root lemma".


Students might wonder why contiuous linear operators
are traditionally called "bounded" (when they are not even).
For many linear spaces (roughly those where sequentiality
suffices) , preserving sequential limits is equivalent to
preserving boundedness of sequences (for a linear map).
George Mackey started to functorize this crucial
observation before categories were fully explicit. Now
we can consider the category of all presheaves on the category
of all countable sets, define an "underlying" functor from
Banach spaces to it, and verify that it actually lands in
the subtopos of sheaves for the finite-disjoint-covering
topology. Indeed it not only gives abelian group objects in
the latter topos, but modules over R, the Dedekind reals
of the topos, and a FULL subcategory of those.

The above construction has an analogue using instead=20
Johnstone's coherent topos of sheaves on countable
compact spaces.

Oops
Email is great. I cited Peter before
he could correct himself.=20=20
A possible remedy would be to
consider not just monoids with
zero, but those equipped with a=20
homomorphism from R, so that
points are retractions of that.
This cuts down on the automorphisms,
at least the naturally available ones.

A message from Walter Mazorchuk:

Dear Colleagues,

 thank you very much for your comments on my
abelian envelope question. Because of
my stereotype thinking I missed the point of the
determination of the additive structure by the
multiplicative one in the original formulation.
The stereotype is based on the
fact that I am a representation theorist and the
origin of the question is in module categories,
which are k-linear over some field k. So, the
subcategory I am looking for should be a k-linear
subcategory with the induced k-linear structure.

Best,              Walter

Indeed, being a computer scientist the BHK interpretation (see
wikipedia) of logical connectives (which I can implement on a finite
machine) makes more sense to me than the idea of infinite truth tables.

You seem to think that the only alternative to excluded middle
(forall P:Prop. P \/ not P) is (exists P:Prop. not (P \/ not P))?
However, I'd say that "forall n:Nat. Halt n \/ not Halt n" is clearly
invalid in the BHK interpretation without claiming that there is a
particular statement which  will never be decided, or a Turing
machine which can be never shown to be terminating or not, i.e. even
if we accepts Church's thesis, we arrive at "not (forall n:Nat. Halt
n \/ not Halt n)" but not "exists n:Nat.not (Halt n \/ not Halt n)".

To summarize, your reasoning seems to already presupposes that we
accept Excluded Middle.

Maybe this is related to my reply?

I have made some minor contributions to wikipedia with information on for
example John Robinson, on groupoids, Grothendieck, and the van Kampen
theorem. The last three link to my web site and my counter (which registers
`came from') shows the utility of these links, among many others.

In the past a text had to assume or give an account of basic material. Why
give an account of say Yoneda when there is a reasonable one on  wiki which
a reader can download?

So I would encourage category theorists to develop the accounts.



Ronnie

Dear Andrej,

Conventional functional analysis is largely concerned with Banach=20
spaces, and there's certainly alot that can be said about the=20
category of Banach spaces and linear contractions (i.e., continuous=20
linear transformations with norm less-than-or-equal-to 1). =20

For example, it is symmetric monoidal closed (with internal hom,=20
the space of _all_ continuous linear transformations!) and locally=20
countably presentable.  In fact, it is a countable-ary quasi-variety,=20
and the full subcategory of its finite-dimensional objects is a good=20
example of a *-autonomous category that is not compact closed. =20
[Although it is not hard to prove the latter directly, it can also=20
be seen as an interesting application of Robin Houston's theorem=20
that products and coproducts can not differ in a compact closed=20
category.] =20

In fact, I think Ban is a fine example which can teach any student=20
of category theory a number of salutary lessons:
  1. in category theory, the meaning of isomorphism is fixed---so if=20
you have a pre-existing class of isomorphisms in mind (in this case,=20
the isometric (norm-preserving) isomorphisms), then you must take=20
care in choosing an appropriate class of morphisms;
  2a. there's more to defining internal homs than just slapping an =20
extra structure on the external homs;=20
  2b. forgetful functors don't have to be "the obvious thing";
  3. you can't always have your cake and eat it too!---the whole=20
category can not hope to be self-dual, precisely because it is=20
locally presentable (and not a poset).

Of course there are also (unital) C*-algebras, and I can make an=20
interesting point about them too---sometimes one needs to consider=20
maps between C*-algebras which are not *-homomorphisms: for example,
there are "completely positive maps" and "completely bounded maps".
Now, as important as the b.o./f.f. factorisation may be in general,=20
it seems fishy to speak of a category whose objects are C*-algebras
but whose morphisms preserve only part of the C*-algebraic structure;
and so it was that analysts were led to develop the notions of=20
"operator space" and "operator system" which provide the correct=20
level of structure to define c.b. maps and c.p. maps, respectively. =20
In fact, these are quite interesting categories in their own right:
operator spaces are said to model "non-commutative functional analysis"
---but I only have a tenuous grasp of what that is supposed to mean!

I meant to discuss quantale theory and Banach sheaves too, but I've
run out of time---perhaps someone else will pick up the thread.

Cheers,
Jeff.

Vaughan P.,

vp> ... "never heard of Wikipedia."   When five people
tell you x is the answer to your question, ...

I appreciate your exasperation.  Am afraid
that almost everyone who replied to my question
is severely over-estimating my state of
comprehension.  My background is primarily in
engineering and physics, whereas most of you
teach at the honours undergraduate and graduate
levels.

At present I am trying to understand the concept of
map object and the exercises on pp. 314 and 315 of L&S.
Long ago, a professional mathematician, as you all
are, advised: When stuck, find examples until you
come to an understanding.  Presently I am looking
for examples illustrating Exercises 1-6.  Fred's
reply is a good start.  Longer chains suggested by
Matt H. will be interesting, if not necessary.

Skipping ahead 34 pages, I see that map objects
are an ingredient of a topos.  A scan of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyting_algebra
reports that "map object" is not in the page.
Perhaps it should be.  Neverthless, working
through the book systematically seems more
promising than reading about toposes and Heyting
algebras before understanding map objects.

fwl> ... Heyting's Algebras and one of their
possible objective origins. The 2nd edition
should correct this omission.

I don't want to be presumptuous, but if some
of the tiny categories mentioned by Fred and
Matt can also fit into the second edition, that
would certainly interest me.  Without this
text, my endeavour to learn category th. would
be quite a battle.  Thanks!

I should have explained at the beginning,
the intention in seeking the examples.  Sorry
for the aggravation.

Regards,          ... Peter E.

Following Jeff Egger, who wrote, in part, "Ban is a fine example which
can teach any student of category theory a number of salutary lessons,"
but asking forgiveness for tooting my own horn, I'd like to point out =

another one of those lessons -- my old characterization of Banach =

conjugate spaces as the algebras over the double-dualization monad =

on {Ban}. Neat mix of Beck Theorem, functional analysis, and more, on
pp. 227-240 of: =


Proc. Conf. Integration, Topology, and Geometry in Linear Spaces,
in: Contemporary Mathematics, Volume 2, AMS, Providence, 1980.

Might even serve as one student's "individual reading report" project.

There's also my even older squib on "Functorial Measure Theory," in pp.
36-49 of: Proc. Conf. Functional Analysis, UC Irvine, 3/28-4/1, 1966,
Thompson Book Co., Wash., DC, & Academic Press, London, 1967. This one
breathes life into the slogan, "Measures are adjoint to functions."

Cheers,

-- Fred

Most of the material connecting analysis and category theory seems to be
written by specialists in category theory who have observed some of the ways
that insights from category theory can be brought to bear (for example look on
Math Sci Net at the many papers (co)authored by Joan Wick Pelletier.)  But
here's an example which is a book on functional analysis that has a strong use
of categories:


@book {MR0296671,
    AUTHOR = {Semadeni, Zbigniew},
     TITLE = {Banach spaces of continuous functions. {V}ol. {I}},
      NOTE = {Monografie Matematyczne, Tom 55},
 PUBLISHER = {PWN---Polish Scientific Publishers},
   ADDRESS = {Warsaw},
      YEAR = {1971},
     PAGES = {584 pp. (errata insert)},
   MRCLASS = {46E15 (46M99)},
  MRNUMBER = {MR0296671 (45 \#5730)},

If you read the TAC instructions for authors, you will find that we
discourage the use of the graphics package unless absolutely necessary
because, for the time being, dvi is still our basic archive format and
graphics specials were not rendered properly by dvi viewers.  I recently
discovered that at least one dvi viewer does indeed render graphics
specials.  Namely the yap viewer that comes with miktex, a
windows-specific implementation of tex enters something called dvips mode
(meaning, I imagine, an on-the fly conversion to ps and then rendering
that).  To be more precise, miktex2.5 asks if you want dvips mode (why
wouldn't you?) and miktex2.7 enters it automatically.  (I don't know about
2.6).

As far as I know no Unix (or Linux) viewer does this.  Neither pdflatex
nor dvipdfm renders graphics specials correctly.  The only way I have been
able to get correct pdf files is to first use dvips to make a ps file and
then use ghostscript to convert to pdf.

Still, one can hope that these problems will disappear in some future
implementations and we may withdraw our objections to the use of the
graphics package.  At that point, our reluctance to use Paul Taylor's
diagrams will also disappear.  For the time being, however, we will
continue to recommend the use of xy-pic and, in particular, the diagxy
front end.

CONTENTS:
1) List of accepted papers
2) Call for informal presentations
3) Call for participation


1) Accepted papers

The list of accepted papers can be found at
      http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/cie08/give-page.php?18


2) Informal Presentations

There is a remarkable difference in conference style between
computer science and mathematics conferences. Mathematics
conferences allow for informal presentations that are prepared
very shortly before the conference and inform the participants
about current research and work in progress. The format of
computer science conferences with pre-produced proceedings
volumes is not able to accommodate this form of scientific
communication.

Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, also this
year's CiE conference endeavours to get the best of both worlds.
In addition to the formal presentations based on our LNCS
proceedings volume, we invite researchers to present informal
presentations. For this, please send us a brief description of
your talk (between one paragraph and half a page) before

                         30 April 2008.

Please submit your abstract via our Submission Form, now online
at:
    http://www.cs.swansea.ac.uk/cie08/abstract-submission.php
You will be notified whether your informal presentation has been
accepted before 15 May 2008.

Let us remind you that there will be three post-conference
publications of CiE 2008, see
    http://www.cs.swansea.ac.uk/cie08/publications.php
All speakers, including the speakers of informal presentations,
are eligible to be invited to submit a full journal version of
their talk to one of the post-conference publications.


3) Registration for CiE 2008 is now open:
    http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/cie08/registration.php
The early registration deadline is

                         4 May 2008.

You can also use the registration process to book accommodation.
Please note that the current prices as listed on our website
    http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/cie08/accommodation.php
are only guaranteed until 31 March 2008.

Colin is exactly right on all points.

I tend to look at sets from the perspective neither of a set theorist
nor a category theorist but a combinatorialist.  As long as people agree
on the cardinalities of the homsets between sets, particularly the
finite ones, I figure they must be talking about essentially the same
objects.  Infinite domains are problematic for everyone, infinite
codomains much less so (we understand the homset N^2 much better than 2^N).

The remark in my post about the self-evident being merely a convenient
long-held hypothesis (which I put on my "sayings" website
http://boole.stanford.edu/dotsigs.html less than a month ago) applies in
spades to membership as characteristic of sets, the premise for ZF.
Those who identify acceptance of the category Set with acceptance of ZF
have not only not accepted but not even grasped that the wholesale
replacement of the binary relation of membership by the (partial) binary
operation of composition, with a set of axioms radically different from
those of ZF, is a foundational move.  ZF is so deeply ingrained in their
thought processes that they have no idea how to think about mathematical
structures without falling back on its axioms.  Borrowing from Hilbert,
they are unable to replace "set," "function," and "composite" by
"table," "chair," and "beermug."

If you find it hard to imagine how anyone could find it hard to imagine
mathematics without ZF, just read Steve Simpson on 2/25/98 (almost
exactly a decade ago) at

http://cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/1998-February/001228.html

The bit "I totally repudiate every syllable of every word of every
subclaim of every claim that McLarty has ever made about what he is
pleased to call `categorical foundations'" made abundantly clear back
then that Steve could not begin to concieve of replacing membership by
composition as the basis for an alternative foundation of mathematics.

While I can't speak for Steve today, this remains a stumbling block for
those raised to believe that rigorous mathematics would not be possible
in a world where propositions such as "for all x and y there exists z
such that x is a subset of z and y is a member of z" did not hold.  How
could  x U {y}  fail to exist and the walls of mathematics not come
tumbling down?

Call for participation.

	        Workshop on
            MODAL FIXPOINT LOGICS
         Amsterdam, March 25-27 2008
     http://staff.science.uva.nl/~yde/mfl

Registration deadline: March 19, 2008

Modal fixpoint logics constitute a research field of considerable
interest, not only because of their many applications, but also
because of their rich logical/mathematical theory. Systems such as
LTL, PDL, CTL, and the modal mu-calculus, originate from computer
science, and are for instance applied in the theory of program
specification and verification. The richness of their theory stems
from the deep connections with various fields in logic, mathematics,
and theoretical computer science, such as lattices and universal
(co-)algebra, modal logic, automata, and game theory.

Large areas of the theory of modal fixpoint logics, in particular the
connection with the theory of automata and games, have been intensively
investigated and are by now are well understood. Nevertheless, there
are still many aspects that are less explored. This applies in particular
to the model theory, intended as the study of a logic as a function of
classes of models, the proof theory, the algebraic logic, duality theory
in the spirit of Stone/Priestly duality, and the relation to the theory
of ordered sets as grounding the concept of "least fixpoint".

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers from various
backgrounds, in particular, computer scientists and pure logicians,
who share an interest in the area.

The workshop program is available from the web site=20

for which an e-version has been downloadable. However as the review says:
"the exposition is based on functional analysis rather than on category
theory; this fact will, undoubtedly, allow the subject to reach a wider

mentioned Semadeni _Banach spaces of continuous functions_ as using a
categorical perspective.  Maybe that is the book I need.

I want to understand Grothendieck's functional analysis in more detail
than just to say he used categorical definitions of different tensor
products to explain Fredholm kernels.  For a start, I know nothing about
Fredholm kernels except what is on Wikipedia.  Grothendieck's own
writings on it are long and start with many definitions so that it is
hard for me to see the point -- he even says in Recoltes et Semailles
that he never really *felt* the point but did it as an assignment.  So
that work shows nothing like the very clear motivation he gives for
schemes and etale cohomology in SGA.

What is a good introduction to his contributions in functional analysis?

best, Colin

Every student who learned the basics of operator algebras knows the
Gelfand-Naimark representation theorem, usually stated non-
categorically as "every commutative unital C*-algebra is isomorphic to
the algebra of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space".
Asking such students to check that this is part of a dual equivalence
of categories is probably a good idea, and based on this one can do
exercises about particular algebras they know - for instance to
compute presentations by generators and relations of C(T^n), the
algebra of continuous functions on the n-dimensional torus, which by
the duality is instantly reduced to finding a presentation of C(S^1),
etc. Also, some students might be willing to work out how the
existence of presentations of C*-algebras by generators and relations
relates to the fact that the category of C*-algebras is algebraic over
Sets.

I'm curious what you mean by this.  One of my duties as Managing Editor
of Homology, Homotopy and Applications is to oversee the copyediting and
typesetting, and I produce the final versions of all files in dvi, ps
and pdf format on my linux machine.  We receive files using quite a
variety of graphics packages, including the "graphics" package, and
rarely have any problems with the resulting dvi files.  (I test using
xdvi.)  The only problem I can recall is with figures that are rotated
90 degrees, and for such papers we simply don't make the dvi file
publicly available.

> Neither pdflatex nor dvipdfm renders graphics specials correctly.

The pdf files for HHA are almost always produced using dvipdfm, and
again this works quite reliably in my experience.  In some cases, we use
pdflatex, and again I have had no trouble with it.  dvipdfm works even
in the one or two cases where xdvi didn't display a file correctly,
such as with rotated figures.

And while for most files I regard dvi as the primary processed archive,
I also use the snapshot package to save most of the .sty files each
article includes, so that if necessary in the future the articles can be
reprocessed to produce some hypothetical new format that contains
information not in the dvi file.  (E.g. to add hyperlinks to all
articles.)

While I am writing, I'd like to encourage readers of this list to submit
articles to HHA and to ask their libraries to subscribe if they don't
already.  The price is quite reasonable, and we regularly publish
articles with a categorical bent.  All articles are available online at

  http://intlpress.com/HHA

You can receive announcements of new articles by writing directly to me
and asking to be put on the announcements mailing list.

Best wishes,

Dan

Maybe not the walls of mathematics, but what about theorems like "every
polynomial functor on Set has a unique initial algebra whose structure map
is an identity"?  I think theorems like this are worth retaining (and
antifoundation makes even more of them).

I'd also like to suggest that "foundations" is being used in two very
different senses.  In FoM, it's about quantifying the philosophical risks
involved in particular formal systems and proofs, i.e. issues such as
relative consistency, omega-consistency, etc.  For this purpose the
primacy of membership vs composition is quite immaterial. One could, I
suppose, make a formal theory based on composition equal in strength (in
whatever sense) to ZF.

Category theory on the other hand is about fundamental algebraic
structures.  I don't think it makes sense to ask "is category theory
omega-consistent?" as one can for ZF (not that anyone knows the answer).

I find that it's NOT the case that I "accept neither" -- rather,
it's that I sometimes prefer neither to accept it, nor to reject it,

Dear Andrej,

Two examples that have not been mentioned before:
* The use of the Giry monad in stochastic processes. This should motivate CS
students as well as (functional) analysists. You can also use co-algebras
here.
* Gelfand's theorem: commutative C*-algebras are precisely the complex numbers
in the topos of sheaves over its spectrum. This will also teach them that the
axiom of choice is almost never needed in functional analysis and that there
are good reasons to avoid it: E.g. continuous fields of C*-algebras.
This is the fundamental work by Banaschewski and Mulvey.

Bill is quite right on what the author's say. I'd also be glad of any of
Bill's comments on the `Historical remarks on the development of smooth
calculus', pp, 79-83, which seem very carefully put.

It might interest people to give what seems the origin of the word
`convenient category'. In my 1963 paper `Ten topologies for X x Y' (a title
frivolously influenced by `Seven brides for seven brothers') I wrote in the
Introduction:

`It may be that the category of Hausdorff k-spaces is adequate and
convenient for all purposes of topology'.

`Convenient' here meant cartesian closed. One of the above ten topologies
gives monoidal closed on all Hausdorff spaces. Some later writers removed
the Hausdorff restrictions (I tried, but I was at that time not too good on
final topologies). The current acount in `Topology and Groupoids' was
influenced by Eldon Dyer.

But for analysis the Kriegl-Michor comments show how the emphasis moved from
k-spaces to ideas from Frohlicher, Bill and others.

If we leave out "the structure map is the identity", I have no
problem. The 2nd part seems to be rather cosmetical anyway, but in a
bad sense of hiding the structure. Yes, I know you save some ink...

Exactly, the discussion is similar to the question whether the carta
of human rights should be written in English or French. I don't care
whether foundations are expressed in the language of predicate logic,
category theory or type theory  as long as they make sense (to me).
Having said this I prefer the latter two, which work very well
together, but this again has to do with beauty as opposed to cosmetics.

I'm not familiar with that particular result, but I know other
categorical proofs which use set-theoretic ideas like transfinite
induction, and so cannot be detached from ZF in an obvious way.  On
the other hand, there is nothing intrinsically "membership-based" in
transfinite induction.  The problem seems to be the lack of a
categorical analogue of ZF's axiom of replacement, since the sets in
V_{\omega+\omega} already form a well-pointed elementary topos with a
NNO.  I find this especially mysterious because on the surface,
replacement merely replaces a set by an isomorphic one (or at most a
quotient)!

One categorical analogue of replacement comes from categories of classes in
algebraic set theory.  That is, we move from a categorical analogue of ZF
to an analogue of Godel-Bernays set theory.  But it seems natural to wonder
whether there could be a categorical analogue of replacement expressible
solely as a property of the category Set, without reference to how it sits
in a category of classes.  Has anyone studied this question?

This is so fundamental that I'm inclined to make it an axiom.
(Well, we can leave uniquiness --up to isomorphism, you mean--
and the invertibility of the structure map for theorems.)
This is essentially an axiom of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions,
which (like most modern type theory) is easily put in categorial language.

All the same, I find these matters much easier to understand
when I think about them in terms of categories of sets,
rather than in terms of (models of a) membership-based set theory.
I would be able to read FoM if it weren't so hostile to this
(although I'll follow Vaughn in noting that I haven't looked lately,
so I can't speak for what it's like now).

No, but one can ask of a topos with a natural-numbers object N
(and satisfying other properties that match various axioms of ZF),
given a morphism X -> N whose pullbacks 0, 1, 2, ...: 1 -> N
are all occupied (so each pullback has a morphism from 1),
whether the negation of X over N (the internal hom [0, X]
taken in the slice category over N) can also be occupied.

I have one and a half things backwards here.

First of all, of course negation is [X, 0] rather than [0, X].
(But in exponential notation, it is 0^X; that is my excuse.)

Also, my placement of "can" implies that the relevant question
is whether there ~exists~ a topos E (with given properties)
and there exists an object X in E (with the properties that I described);
rather, the question is whether for ~every~ E (with given properties)
there exists an object X in E (with the properties that I described).
Iff so, then the properties required of E are omega-inconsistent.
(Iff E must be a terminal category, then they are simply inconsistent.
Thus omega-inconsistency is weaker than inconsistency,
and omega-consistency is stronger than mere consistency.)

Then Jeff Egger wrote in part:

Indeed, the "obvious" forgetful functor from Ban to Set (or Top or Met)
takes a Banach space to its space of all points,
while the "good" one takes the space to its unit ball.

Anyway, if you mix these, then a linear transformation is bounded
iff it is bounded as a function from the unit ball to the space of all points.
Similarly for compact linear transformations (the image is compact).
That may not be the origin of these terms, but it's how I understand them.


More related to category theory itself:

Jeff also wrote:

>in category theory, the meaning of isomorphism is fixed

I'd say that the meaning of a term like "Banach space"
necessarily includes the idea of what an isomorphism of such is.
If different definitions define equivalent groupoids
(or equivalent omega-groupoids in the most general case,
as with different definitions of n-category, for example),
then we can consider them equivalent defintions.
So to define the essence of what Banach spaces are,
one must specify (up to equivalence) the groupoid Ban_0
of Banach spaces and linear isometries between them.

That said, there is some sense in the category Ban_b
of Banach spaces and bounded linear transformations between them,
but it is only a secondary notion compared to Ban_0.
To be useful at all, it needs some extra structure,
such as (at least) the dagger operator (giving duals of morphisms);
then the actual isomorphisms of Banach spaces (those in Ban_0)
are only the ~unitary~ (dual = inverse) isomorphisms in Ban_b.
(In contrast, the category Ban as Jeff defined it
needs no extra structure to be a sensible concept,
since all of its isomorphisms are in Ban_0 already.)

This dagger operator is used, for example, to make Hilb_b
(the full subcategory of Ban_b whose objects are Hilbert spaces)
into a 2-Hilbert space (from John Baez's HDA4),
which is useful if you want examples of 2-Hilbert spaces;
but the ~essence~ of what Hilbert spaces are
is given by the groupoid Hilb_0 of linear isometries.

So here is another lesson of category theory,
to be taken together with Jeff's lesson last quoted above:
Sometimes different notions of morphism are useful for different purposes.

yes: Carsten Butz, Thomas Streicher, Alex Simpson and I did.
See the first two items under 2007 on the AST site:

http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/ast/

The short answer is, it depends on how "Sets" sits in the category of
classes.
In fact, *any* topos can occur as a category of "Sets" satisfying
replacement in a suitable category of classes constructed from the
topos.

Another typo; the word "along" is missing; it should be

>given a morphism X -> N whose pullbacks along 0, 1, 2, ...: 1 -> N
>are all occupied [...]

So:
Given a collection of conditions on a locally cartesian-closed category E
with an initial object 0, a final object 1, and a natural-numbers object N
(various refinements should be possible for more general theories),
these conditions are _omega-inconsistent_ if in every such E
there exists an object X and a morphism p: X -> N such that:
* defining the numerals [i]: 1 -> N using the stucture maps of N
  (so [0]: 1 -> N, [1]: 1 -> N -> N, [2]: 1 -> N -> N -> N, etc)
  and letting X_i be the pullback of p: X -> N and [i]: 1 -> N,
  each X_i has a morphism a_i: 1 -> X_i;
* letting [X,0]_N be the internal hom from X to 0 in the slice category E/N,
  there is (in E itself) a morphism b: 1 -> [X,0]_N.

I've read this 5 times, in different orders, so there should be no mistakes.
I apologise for any confusion from my abbreviations and corrections.

Very interesting!  But I don't think that is the answer to the
question I intended to ask, although perhaps I phrased the question
poorly.  As far as I can tell, you give a way of interpreting
replacement/collection in such a way that it is satisfied in all
toposes, by "constructivizing" the existential quantifier.  But as you
say, "In consequence, the standard arguments using Replacement that
take one outside of V_\lambda(A) for \lambda non-inaccessible, are not
reproducible."  What I would really like to know is, can one formulate
an elementary property of a topos which *does* allow one to reproduce
the standard arguments of Replacement?

Here's another way to phrase the same (or a similar) question.
Suppose I meet a mathematician who thinks categorically enough to
dislike the membership-based nature of ZF(C), but doesn't want to give
up any of its consequences.  In particular, he wants to be able to use
transfinite induction beyond \omega+\omega.  For instance, he wants
Borel determinacy to be true, which is provable in ZFC but not in
Zermelo set theory (ZFC minus Replacement).  Is there a categorical
foundation I can tell him to use?  That is, is there an elementary
categorical theory which is as strong as ZF(C)?

I'm not sure what "retaining" means here.  Does the category Set, even
as a cartesian category, have *any* properties that are open to debate?
  (Other than by intuitionists, who seem to thrive on quicksand.)  For
Set as a cartesian closed category I can see room for debate about the
number of nonisomorphic sets that can appear along a chain of monics
from X to 2^X when X is infinite (defined say as admitting endomonics
that are not automorphisms), but relatively little in practical
mathematics seems to hinge on the outcome.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but my impression is that for any given
language in which to express properties of Set, whether that of
categories, cartesian categories, cartesian closed categories, or
toposes, the properties of Set, understood classically and up to
equivalence, are essentially fixed modulo largely irrelevant minutiae
such as the above.

Your example is a perfectly identifiable property of any category with
polynomial functors (suitably defined) such as Set.  If the polynomial
functors are those generated from the identity functor by binary product
and coproduct, e.g. X, X+X, X^2, X+X^2, etc. then it holds of Set
because then the initial algebra is always the empty set (but you
probably had the empty product 1 in mind as well).  If Set didn't have
that property it wouldn't be Set, just as Z wouldn't be Z if integer
addition wasn't commutative.

The property P = "for all objects x and y there exists a set z for which
x is a subset of z and y is a member of z" holds of all models of ZF.

It cannot be said to hold of the category Set however, not because we
can't prove it, i.e. can't imagine how assuming it false could do any
harm, but because we can't define it, i.e. can't imagine how it could be
either true or false.  What does it even mean when applied to Set as a
category, or as a cartesian closed category, or even as a topos?  More
structure than that has to be added to Set to make P meaningful.

The same goes for AFA.  Chapters 1-6 of Aczel are developed starting
within the ZF framework.  Categories enter at Chapter 7, but Set is
already fully encumbered at that point with all the machinery necessary
to interpret all sentences of the language of ZF, where P is true.  In
that sense even FA (the Foundation Axiom) creates properties of Set that
are not meaningful for Set as a mere topos.

AFA as a weakening of FA means that generically there are fewer
properties than with FA, not more.  Fixing a particular model of AFA
creates properties specific to the model, which may or may not
contradict FA.  (Every model of ZF is automatically a model of ZF-FA+AFA.)

Augmenting Steve Awodey's reply to M. Shulman I want to mention
a further possibility which is more in the spirit of type / category
theory, namely that of universes in toposes as described in my
article with the same title (available under
(www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/NOTES/UniTop.ps.gz).

It is essentially a catgorical variant of Martin-Loef's notion
of universe albeit an impredicative one. It was used a lot
in categorical semantics of type theory (starting ~1985)
but certainly part of the categorical folklore. The first
written account I know of is Jean B'enabou's "Probl`emes
dans le topos" from 1973. His main example that time was
decidable K-finite objects in a topos with nno.

A universe in a topos EE is a pullback stable class SS
of morphism admitting a generic element in SS, i.e. a
map E -> U in SS from which all other maps in SS can be obtained
via pullback. Replacement is modelled by the requirement that
SS be closed under composition. Of course, one usually requires
more further closure properties (as in type theory).

In the above mentioned paper I have shown that all Grothendieck
and realizability toposes admit such universes (exploiting
Grothendieck universes on the meta-level).

As far as I can see universes serve well the purpose of replacement
in mathematics, namely defining families of types by recursion.
They achieve this goal in a more direct way than replacement does.
The reason why they are presumably weaker than the setting Steve
mentioned is that one needs a type-theoretic collection axiom
(as in Joyal and Moerdijk's "Algebraic Set Theory") besides W-types
for constructing set theoretic universes from type theoretic ones.

I don't know why universes have hardly been considered in topos theory.
(One notable exception being B'enabou's calibrations giving notions of
size when considering locally small fibrations.) I think they are most
useful and actually indispensible for doing category theory in the
internal language of a topos.

Algebraic Set Theory is an instance of universes, namely universes
within categories modelling first order logic.

no, the existential quantifier has its standard (categorical)
interpretation (direct image), not the "constructive" one from type
theory.  We do not reinterpret replacement/collection either -- they
have their usual interpretation.

What is a bit delicate is the background category of classes in which
the (set-theoretically) unbounded quantifiers are interpreted.

Yes,  What you do is start with ETCS, and adjoin an axiom scheme of
replacement.

The axiom scheme says: Suppose a formula associates to each element x of
a set S a set we may call Sx (unique up to isomorphism).  Then there is
some function f:X-->S such that the fiber of f over each element x is
isomorphic to Sx.

Lawvere's ETCS plus this axiom scheme is intertanslateable in the
obvious way with ZF, preserving theorems in both directions (you may
include AxCh in both ETCS and ZF, or exclude it from both).

This has been known from the earliest days of categorical set theory.
My favorite early published proof was stated slightly differently, using
reflection rather than replacement, but it trivially comes to the same
thing.  That is:

The proof in Osius (and several later tests) implies that every
consistent extension of a certain very weak fragment of ZF is
intertranslateable (preserving theorems) with a corresponding extension
of a certain slight extension of ETCS.

Further, when you read the proof, you see the correspondence is entirely
natural.

foundational discussion see

Dear Vaughan,

Let me tell you how it really did occur for me - and I am happy to
proclaim this as true love, not locker-room boasting.

As you know from my book, at the end of the 80s I had learned from
Abramsky and Smyth, not to mention the topos-theorists, that frames
and topological spaces could be used to represent observational
theories (technically, propositional geometric theories). But all my
thinking was classical, even though I knew that frames could embody
non-classical logic. I assumed that one manipulated the frames within
a classical world.

I was investigating how one might understand predicate geometric
logic in a similar observational way, and this led me to my bagtopos
construction in "Geometric Theories and Databases". But even there, I
was thinking of formal logical manipulations in a classical world. In
particular, I was thinking of geometric morphisms as being defined by
formal translations of symbols to geometric formulae, similar to the
way I treated locale maps in my book.

It was Peter Johnstone who showed me a different way, with his paper
"Partial products, bagdomains and hyperlocal toposes". He generalized
my bagtoposes and described a universal property of them. He also
showed that his more general construction was, in the contexts where
mine was defined, equivalent to it. This equivalence involved
describing geometric morphisms between different classifying toposes,
and at that point I was expecting to see formal logical
transformations. But when I eventually understood his proof I saw
that he was doing something different and much more natural: he used
the internal mathematics of the toposes to show how models of the
geometric theories transform. This only works if the reasoning is
geometric, and from then on I have grown to love the geometric
reasoning better as a route to better understanding of toposes (and
locales too, for that matter). This is what I tried to explain in
"Locales and Toposes as Spaces", my chapter in the Handbook of
Spatial Logics.

As a parable, I think of toposes as gorillas (rather that elephants).
At first they look very fierce and hostile, and the locker-room
boasting is all tales of how you overpower the creature and take it
back to a zoo to live in a cage - if it's lucky enough not to have
been shot first. When it dies you stuff it, mount it in a threatening
pose with its teeth bared and display it in a museum to frighten the
children. But get to know them in the wild, and gain their trust,
then you begin to appreciate their gentleness and can play with them.

The gorilla in the cage is the topos in the classical world.

Best regards,

Steve.

Here's something that tickled me. A sign outside a monastery in
Meteora, Greece, says -

    "O topos einai ieros"

("The topos is holy")

I suspect that this feeling is shared to a greater or lesser degree by =

I also suspect that it arises out of perceptions based on Brouwer's

Hilbert's particular expression of The Law of the Excluded Middle, =
rather
than on a perception of what it was that Brouwer was actually objecting =

In other words, such perceptions may be vulnerable to the "cover-up"

Lecture:

and so on. So there isn=92t any place to publish, in a dignified manner, =
what

I believe that Brouwer's "finished" articulation of his objection to

be an
instance of such unconscious =91cover up=92; if so, it is one that has =
had an
unintended, far-reaching and severely limiting consequences on a =
discipline.

The basis for my belief lies in Hilbert's interpretation of the =
universal
and existential quantifiers, which is detailed, for instance, in his =
1927
paper "The Foundations of Mathematics".

In this paper, Hilbert defines the quantifiers in terms of his
epsilon-function as:

(i) The formal sentence [(All x)F(x)] holds under a consistent
interpretation I if, and only if, the interpreted relation F(s) holds
whenever ~F(s) holds for any given s in I; hence ~F(s) does not hold for =
any
s in I (since I is consistent}), and so F(s) holds for any given s in I.

(ii) The formal sentence [(Exists x)F(x)] holds in I if, and only if, =
the
interpreted relation F(s) holds for some s in I.

He then deduces from it "Aristotle's dictum" and the "principle of the
excluded middle":

 (iii) Aristotle's dictum: If the formal sentence [(All x)F(x)] holds in =
I,
then the interpreted relation F(s) holds for any s in I,

and:

(iv) Principle of excluded middle: If the formal sentence [~(All x)F(x)]
holds in I, then the formal sentence [(Exists a)(~A(a)] holds in I.

(I assume that the above paper also reflects Hilbert's thesis prior to
Brouwer's objection.)

Now, in his 1908 paper "The Unreliability of the Logical Principles",
Brouwer stressed that, for Hilbert's above interpretation to be =
considered
sound when the domain of the quantifiers under an interpretation is
infinite, the decidability of the quantification under the =
interpretation
must be constructively verifiable in some intuitively and mathematically
acceptable sense of the term "constructive".

I doubt whether any practicing mathematician would take serious issue =
with
this objection.

I feel it is the perception that Brouwer's - and the Intuitionistic -
objection relates specifically to the Law of the Excluded Middle - of =
which
(iv) is merely one statement - that seems to give rise to the sense of
disquietitude expressed by Vaughan Pratt in his above cited post.

The reasons for such disquietitude are not far to seek.

Currently it is implicitly accepted (as intuitively plausible) by =
practicing
mathematicians that, in first-order Peano Arithmetic (PA) for instance:

(1) The PA-formula [(Exists x)F(x)] is an abbreviation of [~(All =
x)~F(x)],
and is defined as true in the standard interpretation M of PA if, and =
only
if, it is not the case that, for any given natural number n, the =
interpreted
relation ~F(n) holds in M;

(2) The interpreted relation F(n) holds in M for some natural number n =
if,
and only if, it is not the case that, for any given natural number n, =
~F(n)
holds in M.

Now, since (1) and (2) together interpret (Exists x)F(x) in M as =
intended by
Hilbert's epsilon-function, they similarly attract Brouwer's objection -
which, thus, remains unresolved in current literature.=20

Thus, for a practicing mathematician today, the Intuitionistic rejection =
of
the Law of the Excluded Middle should be tantamount to rejecting the
standard interpretation of first-order PA as a valid model for PA.

This is not obvious if Brouwer's objection is perceived as primarily
rejecting Hilbert's principle of the excluded middle (iv), since the =
latter
may have other avatars, not all of which need attract Brouwer's =
objection.

In other words, Brouwer's objection needs to be seen not as rejecting =
the
Law of the Excluded Middle per se, but as specifically rejecting only
Hilbert's interpretation of the existential quantifier in (ii).

The point to note then is that, whereas (1) by itself preserves the =
formal
properties of PA-negation under interpretation in M, the further =
inference
in (2) from (1) does not; and it is this inference that is objected to =
by
Brouwer.

Moreover, Brouwer's objection becomes significant only if we accept that =
(2)
appeals to Platonically non-constructive, rather than intuitively
constructive, plausibility.

Since most practicing mathematicians are comfortable with informal =
Platonic
reasoning, but uncomfortable with formal reasoning that cannot be
interpreted constructively, it is this aspect of (2) that appears to =
place
them on the horns of the following dilemma:

Even if we accept that the existential quantifier is interpreted
non-constructively in current literature by accepting (2), how do we
interpret such quantification constructively without sacrificing
mathematical reasoning and mathematical structures that a practicing
mathematician intuitively accepts as well-founded?

This is the grey area that Intuitionistic - and finitist - reasoning =
have
sought to address since Brouwer, primarily by focusing on what remains =
of
classical mathematics (post Hilbert) after rejecting (2) above.

The problem, of course, is that rejection of a widely - even if
uncomfortably - held tenet is never a solution unless one replaces it =
with
one that is less uncomfortable.

This is the "It's better to live in a house with a leaking roof, than to
bring the roof down over one's head" syndrome.

So the question is: Can we provide a "comfortable", finitary, =
interpretation
of PA that accepts (1), but rejects (2) if necessary?

I believe that every practicing mathematician knows that the answer to =
this
question must be a "yes', since mathematical languages seem to =
communicate
effectively in practice in all areas of human endeavour.

In other words, every practicing mathematician knows that the =
significant
body of mathematical reasoning and structures is founded on a finitary
foundation.

The issue, therefore, is simply one of identifying the structure.

Now Turing has shown in his seminal 1936 paper on computable numbers =
that
every arithmetical function (or relation, when interpreted as a Boolean
function) F defines a Turing-machine TM_F.

This suggests the possibility of replacing (1) by:

(3) The PA-formula [(Exists x)F(x)] is an abbreviation of [~(All =
x)~F(x)],
and is defined as true in an interpretation B of PA if, and only if, it =
is
not the case that the Turing-machine TM_F computes F(n) as always false
(i.e., as false for any given natural number n in B).=20

Now, I have shown in the Dec07 issue of the on-line journal, The =
Reasoner,
that an interpretation along these lines is actually a finitary model =
for
PA, since all theorems of PA interpret as true in B.

http://www.thereasoner.org/

Moreover, the interpretation B satisfies Brouwer's criteria, since - by
virtue of Turing's Halting argument - the mirror of (2) does not hold in =
B.

In other words, in the finitary model B, from the PA-provability of =
[~(All
x)F(x)], we may only conclude that TM_F does not compute F(n) as always =
true
in B.

We may not conclude further that TM_F must compute F(n) as false in B =
for
some natural number n, since F(x) may be a Halting-type of function that =
is
not Turing-computable.=20

What this means is that we may not conclude from the PA-provability of
[~(All x)F(x)] that F(n) does not hold in B for some natural number n.

Of course the consequences of such a finitary model for PA are =
far-reaching,
since it (expectedly?) follows that the accepted standard =
(non-constructive)
interpretation of PA - which is based on accepting (2) above - is not a
model of PA!

I address the above points in detail in a series of commentaries in the
Sep07, Oct07, Nov07, Dec07 and Jan08 issues of The Reasoner and in two
papers that I am compiling for publication:

* Why Brouwer was justified in his objection to Hilbert's unqualified
interpretation of quantification

My answer:

Topos theory, like other theories, is about the interaction of objects
(toposes) and morphisms (geometric morphisms). I see it as inherently an
aspect of category theory. We use category theory to define it and I
believe the most effective expositions on topos theory are those that
are based on category theory. Agreed, a strength of the definition of
topos is that it allows a multi-faceted approach (three blind men ...)
but my personal view is that this must confuse any newcomer. A topos is
a type of category which [insert definition here]. Some of the basic
results of topos theory are [insert categorical lemmas here]. Once these
categorical foundations are in place one is able to (a)
investigate/research toposes and (b) learn more about other (say
logical) aspects of toposes. =20

I don't want to detract from the importance of (b), but (a) can be
carried out without (b).

Dear Vaughan,

I would try to encapsulate what I said in "Locales and toposes as
spaces". My aim there was to present ideas (of generalized space) that
have been known to topos-theorists from the start, but which tend to get
buried in the technical development. I wanted to show how results in Mac
Lane and Moerdijk, or in the Elephant, can be read in a non-standard
order to paint a particular picture. (To indulge myself in metaphors
again, the blind toddler wanders right underneath, between the legs,
feels nothing, and concludes the elephant is very like a generalized
space. In its innocence, it never developed the respectful awe of the
scary bits.)

Some of the encapsulation is in my Linz lecture slides

    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/LinzTalk.pdf

My aim there was to explain how sheaves can be viewed as continuous
set-valued maps, and what that tells us about continuity. In particular,
I wanted to support the idea that "continuous" means "geometrically
definable". This leads to the idea of geometric morphism between toposes
as continuous map between generalized spaces. But then non-classical
reasoning (no excluded middle, no axiom of choice, no impredicative
constructions) enters in immediately as part of the geometricity.

Best regards,

Steve.

Thank you!  This is exactly what I was looking for.

But it doesn't seem to be *well* known any more, or at least
well-disseminated and exposited.  Several people have told me that
they didn't think it was possible to express replacement
category-theoretically without using a category of classes.  And even
now knowing what I'm looking for, I am unable to find more than a
sentence or two about it in any book on topos theory, none of which
actually gives any version of the axiom.

This raises another question.  You mention at the end of this paper
that large-cardinal axioms are "routinely pursued in
isomorphism-invariant terms".  This is clear to me for many types of
large cardinals, but not for the stronger ones that involve elementary
embeddings of the universe of sets.  Ultrapowers have a categorical
analogue, of course (filterquotient) but then there is a transitive
collapse of the entire universe, from which I don't see immediately
how to eliminate the global membership predicate.  Can you give a clue
or a reference?

Thanks again,
Mike

It was Vaughan Pratt who first introduced the Wikipedia thread, in
response to someone who said that he hadn't heard of Heyting algebras.
I added my penniworth, having in mind its treatment of Dedekind cuts
and Locally compact spaces.   Recently, however, discussion has
centred on the notion of Topos.

I have changed the Subject line because Wikipedia is not the only
site of its kind.  Anyone thinking of writing for it should perhaps
also consider:
-  citizendium.org - which looks like Wikpedia because it is run by
the latter's co-founder and now unperson;  citizendium has a strict
policy of using real names and qualifications;
- planetmath.org - in which authors "own" the pages that they have
written until they've demonstrably abandoned them;
- mathworld.wolfram.com - beware that this is owned by Wolfram.

It seems to me that toposes are not a good example on which to base
this discussion, being too advanced a topic.   On the other hand,
if you have opinions about what Wikipedia and the other sites should
say about them, then go ahead and write your article, instead of
discussing it here!

But before you write, please bear in mind that these are resources
for the general educated user, not for specialists in the field.
Have a look around for articles that you find informative about
completely different subjects, for example a medical topic or a
place of interest.  It should begin by making sure that the reader
has come to the right place, for example the word "topos" is also
used about poetry.  Then it should tell the lay person why anybody
would spend their time thinking about this thing.   As we all know,
a topos is an elephant.  Its trunk looks like constructive set theory,
its legs look like topological spaces and its tail is a group.

But I really don't think that a specialist in a particular topic
in mathematics should be writing about their speciality.  You need
to see it from a distance.  Wikipedia has policies forbidding
original research.   Encyclopedia articles should provide "general
knowledge" about background topics.

My research programme is a reformulation of general topology, so
I need to talk about this against a background of general knowledge
about traditional point-set topology, locale theory, continuous
lattices, domain theory, constructive analysis and so on.  However,
since I am doing something completely new, I really don't want to
have to give an account of these subjects before I say my own stuff,
so I would like to be able to cite a textbook or other source that
does so.  And I would like that source to be accessible to student
without specialist knowledge, and NOT depend on or be part of some
other partisan presentation.   Chances are that any account of a
topic that is part of a research paper will depend on somebody
else's foundational system.

For example, I would like to refer to an account of locally compact
spaces.  Having been exposed to locale theory and continuous lattices
for 25 years now, I regard it as a matter of "general knowledge"
that the topologies of locally compact spaces are continuous lattices,
and these in turn carry topologies, named after Jimmie Lawson and
Dana Scott.

However, I find NOTHING about this in the Wikipedia article.  That
and more or less every other article there about topological subjects
adheres to the orthodox view in pure mathematics that all self-
respecting topological spaces are Hausdorff.   If I write a new
article about locally compact spaces for Wikipedia then I will find
myself in conflict both with Wikipedia's anonymous cliques and also
with the mathematical establishment.

If you're interested in rings and not non-Hausdorff spaces, then
please substitute the commutative axiom for Hausdorffness in what
I've just said.  If some basic result about rings, fields or modules
can be formulated without assuming commutativity or charactersistic
zero, at no or a small extra cost, then surely it should be so
formulated.   If the more general treatment is more complicated,
but throws light on the subject, the simpler one should be given
first, and an overview of the more general one afterwards.

Another example of this is excluded middle.   Personally, I
foreswore EM about 15 years ago because I was disgusted by some of
the arguments that people were using in domain theory - "bit-picking",
I called it - that didn't form part of any applications or
philosophy.   EM leads to ugly mathematical arguments, and in very
many cases can simply be avoided by stating them more carefully.
In others (for example intuitionistic ordinals and constructive

The Replacemnt axiom which Colin formulated in his article in Phil.Math.
only works for well-pointed categories. But even in this framework it is
too strong due to its requirement that every external family arises from an
internal one. So it fails for example for the model of ETCS arising from
a countable model of ZFC because there are only countably many internal
families over N whereas there uncountable many external families indexed
by (the global elements of) N.
A defect of the work from the 70ies (Cole, Osius at.al.) is that it just proves
equiconsistency of ETCS and bZ (bounded Zermelo set theory) and not an
equivalence between models of ETCS and bZ.

I think that the more interesting question is what is a model of intuitionistic
set theoy which cannot be well-pointed. For this purpose it is INDISPENSIBLE
to have in our category an object U of all sets.
This was first recognized and formulated by Christian Maurer in his paper
"Universes in Topoi" which appeared in the SLNM volume "Model theory and topoi"
(ed. Lawvere, Maurer, Wraith). Maurer was working in a topos and postulated an
object U (a "universe") of this topos with ext : U >-> P(U) satisfying a few
axioms which ensure that U is a model for IZF (without saying so).
In particular, he has a clear formulation of the axiom of replacement, namely

    (\forall a : U) (\forall f : U^{ext(a)}) (\exists b : U)

        (\forall y : U) (y \in ext(b) <-> (\exists x \in ext(a)) y = f(x))

albeit in a somewhat less readable since he avoids the internal language
of the topos.

This point of view was taken up later in the Algebraic Set Theory (AST) of
Joyal and Moerdijk whose work concentrated on CONTRUCTING (initial) universes
of this kind. A couple of years later Alex Simpson in his LiCS'99 paper took
up Maurer's early insight (at least he refers to Maurer's paper) but weakened
the ambient category to be a model for first order logic (as set theorists do).
The main new ingredient of AST (and Alex's paper) is the assumption of a class
of small maps giving (cum grano salis) a notion of "size" (like B'enabou's
calibrations but satisfying much stronger axioms) together with a notion of
small powerset functor P_s (depending on the class of small maps). A universe
is then defined as a(n initial) fixpoint U of P_s which, of course, can't be
small itself.

A point which seems to have been overlooked in this latest discussion is
that Replacement per set is not very strong. It gets its usual strength only
in presence of unbounded separation. See the paper by Awodey, Butz, Simpson
and me which appeared in last year's Bull.Symb.Logic (see also
http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/als/Research/Sources/set-models-announce.pdf)
where we discuss this in more detail. The point is that around every topos
EE one can build a category of classes whose small "set" part is equivalent
to EE. The corresponding class theory BIST is thus conservative over topos
logic (with nno).

Later on Awodey and his students have also studied the much weaker "predicative"
case where replacement still holds. See also Aczel and Rathjen's work on CZF
in this context which is much older than AST dating back to articles by Aczel
in the late 70ies (and based on previous work by John Myhill).

Writes of the replacement scheme in categorical set theory

There are two issues here, because there are two things to mean by
"replacing set theory."

On one hand it can mean replacing the membership-theoretic approach of
ZF by the categorical approach of ETCS.  This has long been routine and
full details are found in Osius "Categorical Set theory: A
Characterization of the Category of Sets", (Journal of Pure and Applied
Algebra, 1974, pages 79--119).  People do not talk about it a lot
because it was a well-focussed problem which got a perfectly good answer
and at the time there more pressing and more open-ended research issues.

Perhaps also because Saunders Mac~Lane tended to stress that lots of
higher set theory (like lots of logic in general) is very weakly linked
to most of mathematics -- which is true, but is not to say that higher
set theory (or logic in general) need be abandoned.  He hoped they could
be brought back into better touch.

This is the issue raised for example by Feferman and Rao in Giandomenico
Sica ed. _What is category theory?_ {Polimetrica, 2006) when they claim
it is "unclear" whether certain ZF constructions can be given at all in
categorical terms.  Yes, it is clear they can, proven in detail by Osius
in 1976 (not the first proof but my favorite reference on it).


On the other hand, for some purposes we want to replace the category Set
(no matter how it is axiomatized) by something more general, often by
any elementary topos, or it could be any Boolean topos, or category with
a category of classes.

The categorical replacement scheme I mentioned generalizes very well to
any well-pointed topos, but that is little more general than Set.

It makes much use of fibers over global elements.  To put it in the
terms I like, it does nothing to say a family of sets S-->I defined by
replacement should be "smooth" or "continuous over the index set I" in
anyway.  In Set the index *set* is not smooth or continuous to begin
with, it is a discrete set.

The idea of categories of classes is to get some sense of large
collections that *do* vary "smoothly" or "continuously" when the base
has some smooth or continuous character (in a very general sense, so for
example effective computability is the relevant "smoothness" for those
types in the effective topos close to the natural numbers).

The next question brings us back to the first perspective.  It is about
the category Set, but wants to approach that category by categorical tools.

Within ZF itself the global membership predicate X \in S is just one
guise of the relation "the membership-tree of X is (isomorphic to) the
restriction of the membership-tree of S to some node directly below the
top."  Transitive collapse can be re-cast in these terms as dealing with
all well-founded extensional relations and not only dealing with
restricted membership (i.e. restricted to some inner model of ZF) and
actual membership of sets.

In isomorphism invariant terms, a transitive collapse of the universe
means a uniform method of taking any well-founded extensional relation
(not just ZF membership on each transitive closure) and restricting it
to a sub-relation which is still well-founded and extensional (which we
do not bother collapsing to membership on some transitive closure) while
preserving some properties of the first relation.  And then we ask if a
given collapse has any fixed points: are there any well-founded
extensional relation so big that this collapse leaves an isomorphic
relation?

I have no idea what the practical effect would be of recasting collapse
in these terms.  I have never worked with large cardinals and transitive
collapse.  But it certainly *can* be recast this way.  Some one should
try it.

best, Colin

If one assumes that epics split and that
the Boolean algebra of subsets of 1
reduces to two elements, then (to a
first approximation) the main effect
of axiom schemes is to provide=20
larger cardinals.=20

That is explicitly exemplified in the=20
document that has been available in
the University of Chicago Math
Library since 1965, and that has=20
been available in recent years as a
TAC Reprint. Using the definable
classes of sets smaller than any=20
given set, the postulate that there
are arbitrarily large such classes
closed under arbitrary definable
operations phi is proposed.  I am=20
not aware of any further studies
of that postulate. (This may be the=20
first time that a geometer has=20
shown persistent interest in=20
replacement)

Of course above I use the term "class"
in the intuitive sense of a natural
subset of every model of the theory
("meta-" in Mac lane's terminology),=20
that objective meaning corresponding
subjectively to a formula of the theory.
That is, not in the sense of a half-
hearted attempt to  represent classes
by elements V of the model.

(Less half-hearted is the proposal
that seems implicit in the 1963
reaction of Goedel & Bernays=20
themselves when they heard,
presumably from Kreisel, that
work was underway on a=20
categorical set theory. Namely try
a category of classes of classes etc
satisfying at least the intuitive=20
property of cartesian closure.)

The usual replacement scheme=20
does seem at first to yield only
cardinals smaller than given ones.=20
But in the hierarchical view, that=20
quotient set consists of elements=20
which themselves have elements,
thus the actual mathematical=20
content is that of a family of=20=20
sets, a concept whose=20
geometrical expression is that=20
of a fibration, hence Colin's=20
formulation of the axiom.
Indeed the formulation goes back
many years, but I don't have a reference.

Concerning an elementary self-embeddings
of the universe, it is in any case an
additional functor added to the=20

basic structure of category is first-order,
a scheme could be considered to the
effect that such a functor commute
with quantifiers.

Michael Shulman is quite right to press the question of how to express
the axiom scheme of replacement WITHOUT using classes or universes.

There are two traditions on this topic in set theory.  One of them
states replacement and collection "from the outside" by using classes
or universes.   The other, found in ZF itself, somehow builds it up
"from the inside", without pre-supposing classes, although the large
cardinals that result from this hypothesis can themselves be used
as universes for weaker set theories.

Steve Awodey and Thomas Streicher have referred to the excellent
work in Algebraic Set Theory that is collected on Steve's web page at
      www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/ast/
ASD is a categorical treatment that follows the "sets and classes"
tradition.  However, Mike acknowledged that in his original posting,
and, with all due respect, Steve and Thomas have NOT answered his
question there:

Although he had expressed himself quite clearly the first time,
it seems that he needed to put his question again:

I agree that it would be very nice to have a formulation of Replacement
in category theory that was as simple as, say, the notion of subobject
classifier.  I proposed such a thing in the final pages of my book,
"Practical Foundations of Mathematics" (CUP, 1999), and this posting
leads up to my formulation.

Colin McLarty gave a non-AST answer to Mike's question, citing a paper
by Gerhard Osius and one of his own.   I confess that I have not seen
either of these, not currently having access to a university library,
so please excuse me if they already say what I am about to say.

I would, however, ask the algebraic set theorists to acknowledge that
there is another point of view on the question,  albeit one that has
not been worked out so extensively as theirs.

Anybody who has attempted to discuss foundations with either set
theorists or mainstream mathematicians knows that it is impossible to
get them to engage.  Colin McLarty has already pointed this out in
this thread, saying that
 > various people including Sol Feferman promote the view that
 > if you use "sets" then you are admitting that you use ZF and
 > not some categorical foundations.

Of course, set theorists who claim this are simply hijacking the
English language, and we have to resist them in so doing.  One problem
on the other side is that most mathematicians couldn't actually quote
the ZF axioms that they claim to use, without looking them up.

They could, on the other hand, readily give a practical account of
- cartesian products, subsets, disjoint sums and quotients of
   equivalence relations, which are axiomatised in category theory
   as a "pretopos";
- primitive recursion over N, lists and finite subsets, which,
   together with the above, make an "arithmetic universe"; and
- full powersets, which make an "elementary topos";
because they teach this to first year mathematics and computer science
undergraduates.

In Section 2.2 of my book I set out what I call "Zermelo type theory",
because it differs very little from his set theory.  This is what
ordinary mathematicians use, and it is also the ("Mitchell--Benabou
internal") language of a topos.  I would be quite willing to explain
to any set theorist how any statement in my book (apart from the last
section) can be understood in categorical terms within an elementary
topos.

(One of the many uses that I would have for a time machine would be
to go back 100 years, tap Ernst Zermelo on the shoulder while he was
writing "Untersuchungen uber die Grundlagen der Mengenlehre I", and
ask him to make those pairs ORDERED, as it would have avoided so much
trouble since then!  Note that Bourbaki's "Theorie des Ensembles"  DOES
have ordered pairs.)

Some time ago, Saunders Mac Lane found himself in the middle of a
dispute with the set theorists because he had claimed that most of
mathematics could be expressed in an elementary topos with a natural
numbers object.  Unfortunately, I have never managed to work out
exactly which of his publications was the centre of the controversy -
maybe Colin can fill us in here on the bibliographical details.

The bit that's missing, as Mike said, is the axiom scheme of
replacement.

But we are back to the original problem of communication with set
theorists in trying to identify what this actually means.  They are
rather like Proteus in Greek mythology, who could foretell the future,
but only to someone who could capture him, which he would avoid by
repeatedly changing form - into a lion, serpent, leopard, pig, water
or tree (according to Google and Wikipedia).

At first, Replacement appears just to provide the image of a set under
a function.  I have seen several set theory text books that give this
impression, but I suspect that their authors have no idea of the logical
strength of Replacement.  Of course, when you recognise that what
mathematical objects DO is what matters, and not what they ARE, you
appreciate that the image is simply a quotient by an equivalence
relation.  I'm sure that set theorists must have realised a long time
ago that this could be done within Zermelo set theory.

However, no sooner have you rejected that answer than they come up
with another, equally fatuous one: Replacement is needed to construct
the ordinal omega+omega.  Whilst this may actually be true of the kind
of intuitionistic ordinals that I called "plump", it is nonsense in a
classical setting: a model of omega+omega is provided by the even
numbers followed by the odd ones.  It's only the set theorists'
instistance on representing everything by means of epsilons and nested
curly brackets that necessitates Replacement.

Giving up on set theorists for a sensible answer, let's return to
ordinary mathematics.  The usual situation in which Replacement is
needed is when you want to form the limit or colimit of some iterated
construction.  Even then it may be possible to carve the result out
from a sufficiently big object that is definable in Zermelo set theory,
or in an elementary topos with natural numbers.

But there are clear examples in which this cannot be done.  One is
N-fold iteration of the powerset, starting from N itself, since such a
union would itself be a model of Zermelo set theory.  An example of
this arises in domain theory.  Start with the domain X_0 that consists
of N+3 points arranged something like this:

      0  1  2  3  ....
      xxxxxxxxxx
        a    b
         \  /
        bottom

where "xxxxxxxxxx" means that every numeral is above both a and b. Then
form the exponentials   X_n+1 = X_n ^ X_n.   It can be shown that these
are algebraic L-domains (in Achim Jung's terminology) whose bases
increase in cardinality in the same way as the iterated powersets do.

With these examples in mind, we can return to Mike Shulman's original
question, or at least some simple example of it:
     Can we express the transfinite iteration of a functor
     in purely categorical language?
Whether this expresses the full strength of Replacement, I do not know -
probably not.  However, as I have said, it is impossible to engage
set theorists in an intelligent discussion about this, as they seem
to be incapable of thinking outside their idiosyncratic representation
of mathematical objects as epsilons and curly brackets.

Before considering the iteration of functors, we need to have some
categorical notion of "ordinal" and "transfinite".

In anticipation of anyone else who may feel the need to point this out,
let me say first that Andre' Joyal and Ieke Moerdijk studied ordinals
as part of the original book on Algebraic Set Theory.  However, AST is
a "sets and classes" formulation.

I too studied (intuitionistic and categorical) ordinals at the same
time (the mid 1990s),  but in an intrinsic (no classes) way.
My first account of this,
   @article{TaylorP:intso,
    author  = {Taylor, Paul},
    title   = {Intuitionistic Sets and Ordinals},
    journal = {Journal of Symbolic Logic},
    volume  = 61,
    year    = 1996,
    pages   = {705--744}}
developed set theory as (well founded, extensional) epsilon-structure
on a carrier, in the same way as we develop group theory as algebraic
structure on a carrier.   It proved Mostowski's theorem - that any
well founded structure has an extensional quotient - WITHOUT using
Replacement.  The set theory textbooks say that this is necessary,
because of their epsilontic representation.  It then developed set
theory a la Zermelo, and various kinds of intuitionistic ordinals,
providing a parallel approach to that in AST, with analogous results.
(Intuitionistically, there are several different kinds of ordinals.)

Later I studied "well founded coalegebras" and showed that this notion
of INDUCTION implies RECURSION, in the form of coalgebra-to-algebra
homomorphisms.  This is in Section 6.3 of my book,  and also in an
unpublished paper that you can find on my web site at
     www.PaulTaylor.EU/ordinals

Two years ago, a certain categorist tried to pass this work off as his
own, at the Nova Scotia category theory meeting and in the proceedings
of "Computer Science Logic".  In doing so, he also demonstrated his
ignorance of both set theory and category theory as foundations.
I hereby warn him that, should he utter a single word on this subject
in my hearing, I will identify him and publish full details of the
events.

My work on this topic was based on a different paper by Gerhard Osius
from the one that Colin cited,
    @article{OsiusG:catstc,
     author  = {Osius, Gerhard},
     title   = {Categorical Set Theory: a Characterisation
                of the Category of Sets},
     journal = {Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra},
     volume  = 4,
     year    = 1974,
     pages   = {79--119},
     review  = {MR 51/643}}
which is also summarised in Section 9.2 of "Topos Theory" by Peter
Johnstone.   It has also been taken up by Capretta, Uustalu and Vene,
but in the context of functional programming, not set theory.
If there are more recent developments based on the tradition of Osius
then I would be pleased to hear about them.

Briefly, we express an ordinal number  alpha  as a coalgebra
      parse: alpha ---> D(alpha)
in the category of posets,  where  D  is the covariant functor that
yields the poset of lower subsets.   The reason for the name "parse"
is given in my book;  in this case, its set-theoretic translation is
      parse (alpha)  =  { beta | beta epsilon alpha }

Now we are in a position to define transfinite iteration of a functor T.
This has to be INDEXED (or FIBRED if you prefer),  ie it is applied,
not to a single object of the category, but to an  alpha-indexed
family of objects.   The display map    X--->alpha   whose beta'th
fibre is the beta-fold iteration of T on the empty set  is characterised
by the fact that it forms a pullback

[beta:alpha, X[beta]]  --->  [U:D(alpha), colim {TX[gamma] | gamma in U]
        |      |                              |
        |      |                              |
        |------+                              |
        |                                     |
        |                                     |
        |                                     |
        V               parse                 V
     alpha ------------------------------> D(alpha)

Considered in the category of all discrete fibrations over posets,
those for which this is a pullback form reflective subcategory.
More precisely, this subcategory is closed under limits, but it
only has a reflector if the axiom scheme of replacement holds
(say, with the covariant powerset for T).

I don't actually think that the ordinals (ie totally ordered sets) as
such are needed in this approach.  I think one could present it using
proofs (of well formedness of terms in a type theory) instead.  Then
each type theory has a version of Replacement that proves that the
given theory is consistent.

I got a brief and tiny glimpse of the awesome power of the axiom
scheme of replacement in the later stages of writing my book, but that
was ten years ago.  It appeared to say something like this: if you
have some theory that is provably consistent, ie it has a free
internal model, then it has a model that is a submodel of the universe
in which you are working.  Or, "any script can be played out in real
life".  Please forgive me if I cannot now say this very clearly -
I found the idea rather frightening at the time, and it has long since
been "swapped out" of my skull.

Replacement was conceived by Dimitri Mirimanoff in 1917, and
incorporated into Zermelo's axioms by Abraham Fraenkel in 1922.  This
was well after the fuss over Russell's paradox (1900) had died down,
but well before Godel and Turing provided a new generation of
paradoxes in the 1930s.  So it may be that set theorists had let their
guard down in the intervening decades.

On Good Friday 1998, I (thought that I had) found a proof that ZF is
inconsistent, but the system was resurrected on the third day.
I published this "proof" as the final exercise of my book and on
"categories" on 1 April 1999; this posting has since being doing the
rounds, and I got a reply a couple of years ago.  I am certainly not
going to spend my time looking for contradictions in set theory, but
I find it amazing that anyone should be so confident that Replacement
is safe to work with.  I also think that it would do Mathematics a great
deal of good if someone were to find an inconsistency in ZFC.

The uncountability argument mentioned by
Thomas does not apply because Colin's
Replacement axiom does not say that
"all" external families are representable,
only those definable by formulas.

Of course the statement is relatively
simple only when 1 separates, but that
is the case where much of the interest=20
in such axioms has concentrated:
categories of pure Cantorian cardinals.
Speculating about whether such principles
yield anything for the more cohesive
sets encountered in geometry and analysis,
it develops that, although specifying the
internal families is rather easy, explaining
which formulas define the appropriate
external families is not because of the=20
need to include functorality, sheaf=20
condition,etc.

Concerning the 70s work of Cole,Osius,etal,
they certainly constructed in lectures an
equivalence between the categories of models
of bZ and aETCS. Was it not published ?=20
(I don't recall any example showing=20
that the augmentation a was actually needed.)

The statement that Replacement
is weak seems to follow from using that word
to refer to classes derived from an already=20
representable V, rather than the traditional
meaning used by Colin, referring to arbitrary
formulas.

What do you mean by an "external family"?  Do you mean every family that
the mathematician looking at the model from outside it would recognize,
or every family defined by a relation in the first-order language?

Are you just invoking the Skolem paradox in a categorical setting?

What is the axiom scheme "too strong" to do?

Before I can comment I have to ask, do you mean equivalence between
models, or between the categories of models?  Exactly what is it that
you want but feel that work does not prove?

Is it just that you prefer to think about a different question?  As
you put it:

You must use these words differently than I do.  We normally say every
topos is a model of intuitionistic set theory.  Many are not
well-pointed yet have no object of all sets.

Synthetic Differential Geometry (in the full, topos version, not
Synthetic Infinitesimal Analysis as in Bell's book) is one of the
best-known axiomatic extensions of the elementary topos axioms.  It has
no well-pointed models yet its usual models have no object U of all sets.

That is in an intuitionistic setting.  In classical logic, unbounded
replacement implies unbounded separation.  The "replacing set theory"
thread was about replacing ZFC, which has classical logic.

You cite the very nice work you have done Steve Awodey, Carsten Buts,
and Alex Simpson.  But that work does not aim (just) at axiomatizing the
classical universe of sets.  There are different questions here.

best, Colin

I do not understand what is meant by "external" here.  What Colin and
Osius's replacement scheme states is that every *definable* family of
sets is internal.  This is the same as the ZF replacement axiom: every
*definable* function defined on a set is a set.  Since there are only
countably many logical formulas, there are only countably many
definable families for them to define, so there is no problem with
countable models.

In Osius' paper "Categorical set theory" he does prove exactly this
sort of equivalence, by adding a couple weaker extra axioms to ETCS
and bZ relating to the existence of transitive closures and collapses.
 An account can also be found in Johnstone's "Topos Theory", chapter
9.

It is, of course, true that Maurer's and AST's form of replacement is
stronger than the SCHEMA of replacement because it quantifies over all
families in the topos and not just the syntactically definable ones.
The same "mistake" appears in the definition of Grothendieck universes.

Set theorist insist on formulating set theory in first order logic and
therefore must formulate replacement as a schema since they can't quantify
over families of sets (the ambient category is a logos or Heyting category
but not cartesian closed). If they decided to formulate set theory within
higher order logic they presumably would have formulated replacement
not as a schema (see Bill's remarks on Goedel and Kreisel's suggestions).

But of course there is no problem to adapt Maurer's notion of replacement
to the schema form. Nevertheless, since in the schema of replacement there
may occur free variables one has to be careful when quantifying over functions
representable by formulas in the language of set by considering all
reindexings along U^n -> 1. This is not done in McLarty's article. He
just gives a reformulation of the replacement schema WITHOUT free variables.

I presumably tried to pack too much into my mail and thus (again) forgot
about the distiction between schema and the stronger from (sorry Bill!).
My intention was to advocate the necessity of an object U of sets which
is not available in (models of) ETCS. So one cannot directly interpret the
language of set theory in a model of ETCS but has first to CONSTRUCT a model
for set theory from it. But this is only possible because models of ETCS
are wellpointed. So if one is interested in models of constructive set theory
ETCS is not particularly helpful.

I have read that Zermelo always insisted on a second-order
interpretation of his axioms; in particular as regards his notion of a
"definite" property.  It was only later mathematicians who decided
that "definite" should mean "first-order".

Also, the perfectly classical von Neumann-Bernays-Godel set theory,
which set theorists know about and make use of, does use classes to
avoid axiom schemas in the same way that AST does, thereby obtaining a
finitely axiomatizable theory equivalent to ZFC.

Having said that, I will now dive off the deep end into what seems
likely to be very hot water (-:, and say that it seems to me that
"higher-order logic" is really first-order set theory in disguise.
The interpretation of "higher-order quantifiers" ranging over "sets of
blah objects" (or "predicates" or "classes") only makes sense with
respect to an external set theory that specifies what counts as a
"set"---or by introducing a new type called "set of blah objects",
which brings you back into to a first-order set theory.

I think this is more evident now than it was to Zermelo, now that we
have, say, the independence of CH before our eyes to convince us that
the extension of the notion of "subset of a given set" is not uniquely
determined by the idea of "set"---at least, not obviously---and
requires some sort of theory of sets to specify what it means.  I
think that this is one reason that modern set theorists usually stick
to first-order logic.

This is not to dispute the value and power of what is normally called
second-order and higher-order logic.  In particular, what is called
higher-order logic is essential to topos theory and AST, for which I
have a great appreciation and respect.  But I think it does show that
if you get down to the root, all mathematics is actually done in
first-order logic.  For instance, the "higher-order" formulation of
replacement that you advocate is still part of a *first-order* theory
of sets and classes (AST).

Now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that!  It certainly
gives rise to interesting, powerful, and useful mathematics, which I
don't understand nearly as well as I would like to.  But I don't think
it is necessarily indicative of blindness on the part of set theorists
that they choose to include only sets in their first-order logic.

There is something about introducing classes as first-class objects
that makes some of us slightly uneasy: what is it that distinguishes a
set from a class?  What exactly prevents us from talking about classes
of classes?  Why did we draw an arbitrary line at some point and say
"any collection of things bigger than *this* is a class", and forbid
ourselves from doing otherwise intuitive things to them like taking
power objects and exponentials?  Why shouldn't set theory be the
*universal* theory of "collections of things"?

Of course, it is likely that I am quite wrong, so I await correction.

Mike

Wrote, with much else, about an equivalent to the axiom scheme of
replacement in ETCS, and his mimeographed notes on it now reprinted at TAC

It is right at the end, on p. 34 of the reprint.  To me, it is really a
very nice stream-lined version of a reflection principle and deserves
more of a look.  Up to now I have tended to translate it into a
replacement scheme because they are more familiar to my audience.  But
it is much more elegant as it cuts straight down to  a very elegant
isomorphism-invariant principle.

I try to untangle various threads in the recent discussion.

(1) Yes, there is a difference between replacement as a schema and
    the stronger form of replacement as formulated in Groth. universes.
    (To my embarrasment I have blurred this distinction against better
     knowledge!)

(2) One has to carefully distinguish between the following two questions
    (a) find as good as possible an axiomatization of "the" category of sets
        which was the aim of ETCS and Cole, Mitchell and Osius;
        in this situation it is natural to assume wellpointedness
    (b) to ask what are good notions of model for intuitionistic set theories
        where the assumption of wellpointedness is, of course,
        much too restrictive.

(a) and (b) are so different questions that I wouldn't go for comparing them.
Reading Mike Shulman's original mail I had the impression he was going for (b)
when asking whether certain arguments involving transfinite recursion could
be done categorically. There the answer is in general not. Alas, I can't say
anything about the most interesting question about small objects argument. But
I know the answer in case of the classical example where replacement is needed,
namely Borel determinacy. Don Martin gave a proof of Borel determinacy iterating
the powerset functor \omega_1 times and later H.Friedman showed that axiom of
replacement is indispensible for proving Borel determinacy. One also knows that
in the realizability model of IZF (Friedman, McCarty et.al) Borel determinacy
fails although it validates replacement (which is part of the axioms of IZF).

Now I am coming to the real issue which triggered me to take part in the
discussion, namely an apparent confusion between internal and external families
of objects. I thought that on pp.77-79 of my lecture notes on fibrations
(www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/FIBR/FibLec.pdf.gz) I gave a summary
of the "current view" on these questions. But in the light of the recent
discussion I think a few more words seem to be in place.

Suppose EE is a topos. The most immediate notion of external family of objects
is a function I -> Ob(EE) where I is a set. An internal family in EE is simply
a map A -> X in EE. Obviously, these gadgets are quite different because in
general sets aren't objects of EE and objects of EE aren't sets. However,
one can turn an internal family a : A -> X into an external family of objects
in EE indexed by EE(1,X), namely by associating with  x : 1 -> X the object
x^*a, i.e. the (source of the) pullback of a along x.
Now one may ask whether this is a 1-1-correspondence for general toposes EE.
There is a simple example showing that going from internal to external one
looses information: let GG be a (finite) nontrivial group and G the
representable object of Psh(GG) then ALL morphisms to G (and there are plenty)
represent the external empty family of objects of Psh(GG). This might lead one
to think that internal families are just "intensional representations" of
external families. But this view is mistaken since there are external families
of objects of EE which don't arise by externalising internal families. This is
obvious since if EE is a small topos (say the free topos with nno) then there
are I-indexed families of EE where I exceeds the cardinality of any EE(1,X).
But there is the much more refined example of Peter Johnstone (also described
in my notes on the web) of a topos EE over Set and an NN-indexed family of
objects (A_n) in EE which doesn't arise from an internal family in EE. The topos
EE is the full subcat of actions of the group (ZZ,+) on those objects where
there is a finite bound on the size of orbits and A_n is ZZ_n acted on by ZZ
in the obvious way. The reason why this family cannot arise from an internal
family a : A -> X in EE is that there is a finite bound on the size of all
orbits in A and thus on all orbits in the A_x (x \in EE(1,X). But of course
A_n has an orbit of length n and, accordingly, there is not a finite bound
on the orbits of all the A_n.

Of course, if EE is a wellpointed topos the situation is "better". If EE has
also small sums then we clearly have a 1-1-correspondence between internal
families indexed by X and and external families indexed by EE(1,X). But this
isn'the case anymore if we drop the assumption of small sums. Let EE be the
wellpointed small topos arising from a countable model of Z (Zermelo's set
theory, i.e. ZF without replacement schema). Then for reasons of cardinality
there are EE(1,N)-indexed external families which don't arise from an internal
one.

>From some of the mails I got the impression that it is claimed that restriction
to "syntactically definable" (s.d.) families allows one to identify internal
and external. This is definitely wrong for the non-wellpointed case due to the
many different representations of the empty family. It might be the case that
any "syntactically definable" external family indexed by EE(1,X) arises from
some internal family a : A -> X though I don't see how to prove it. (Does any
of the advocates of external families have a proof for that?)

Finally, I would like to point out that there are two different meanings of
the phrase "syntactically definable" family. The one used by Colin in his
Philosophia article means "syntactically definable in the language of ETCS"
and the one used by set theorists is "definable in the language of set theory".
The latter hasn't any meaning in a model for ETCS since such a model doesn't
allow one to interpret a formula in the language of set theory. But, of course,
one can interpret set theoretic formulas in the models of bZ constructed from
a model of ETCS.

The reason why I doubt that models of ETCS and bZ are equivalent is that when
going from a model of ECTS to a model of bZ is that one has to restrict to the
well-founded part. At least that's what I recollect from MacLane and Moerdijk's
exposition in their book. But I am ready to believe that adding wellfoundedness
axioms to ETCS can remedy this situation.

Of course, I might be all wrong with what I have said above. But then I would
like to know what is the appropriate notion of "(external) family of objects"
that one should use in case of non-wellpointed toposes.

Thomas

PS For sake of completeness I can't refrain from mentioning the following
considerations I was told by Jean B'enabou some years ago. Let EE be some topos
(J.B. was of course considering more general situations). Then split fibrations
over EE correspond to categories internal to Psh(EE) = Set^{EE^op} (where Set is
chosen big enough for EE being small w.r.t. Set). Then one my consider the
presheaf  set(EE)  where  set(EE)(X)  consists of representable presheaves
over EE/X. It is natural to define an X-indexed family of objects of EE as
a morphism  y(X) -> set(EE)  but by Yoneda this is an element of set(EE)(X)
corresponding to a map to X in EE.

Dear colleagues,

A semiring is roughly speaking a ring without subtraction, i.e. (R,+,0) is
an Abelian monoid & (R,*,1) is a semigroup with distribution of * over +
(e.g. the set of non-negative integers). A semimodule over a semiring is
roughly speaking a module without subtraction, i.e. (M,+,0) is an Abelian
Monoid, and there is a scalar multiplication of the semiring on M with the
usual expected properties. A semimodule over a semiring is cancellative, if
the Abelian monoid (R,+) is cancellative.

The category of N0-Semimoduels is just the category of "Commutative
Monoids".

Indeed the category of left semimodules over an arbitrary semiring R? (A
special example would be the category of commutative monoids) is not
pre-additive. However, for any left semimodules M and N over a semiring R,
(Hom_R(M,N),+,0) is an Abelian monoid and it has kernels and cokernels.

A monomorphism of semimodules is injective, however only an "image-regular"
epimorphism is subjective. For a morphism of semimodules f: M --> N, the
sequence 0 ---> Coimage(f) --> Im(f) --> is exact, but the canonical map
Coimage(f) --> Im(f) is not an isomorphism (neither a bimorphism), unless f
is regular.  The category of semimodules had products, equalizers and
products (however not necessarily coequalizers). The category of
cancellative semimodules is complete and cocomplete. It has a generator,
namely the semiring itself and I also "expect" it to have exact colimits
(ANY REFERENCE?).

What kind of Categories is the category of (cancellative) semimodules over
semiring? Is there a notion of "almost Grothendieck categories" or
"Semi-Grothendieck Categories" to which categories of (cancellative)
semimodules fit? Unfortunately, I did not find a single book that clarifies
the categorical aspects of semimodules (The 3 books of Golan as well as the
books on the subject by others are devoted more to semirings and automata
and not have much on semimodules).

I appreciate very much your comments, suggestions for literature (e.g.
books, Ph.D. dissertations, articles) on the CATEGROY OF (Cancellative)
SEMIMODULES (other than the papers of Takahashi and Katsov, which I already
have).

With best regards,

Jawad

Maybe I should wave my hands a bit less, and actually spell out a
concrete example.

Here is how you can say that the display map  X-->Nx2  in an elementary
topos with a natural numbers object is the sequence of iterated
powersets, starting with X[0,0]=N, where X[0,1] is the union of X[n,0].
In set-theoretic language, X is then the cardinal  beth_{omega.2}.

Of course, the following is not a CONSTRUCTION of this display map,
just a SPECIFICATION of it:  we need Replacement to say that there
EXISTS a display map that satisfies this specification.

First we define the strict arithmetical order on Nx2:
   (n,0) < (m,0)  if n < m
   (n,0) < (m,1)  always
   (n,1) < (m,1)  if n < m
   (n,1) < (m,0)  never
Nx2 is also a poset, with the reflexive order <= defined as < or =.

Let D(Nx2) be the lattice of lower subsets of Nx2 wrt <=.

Let  parse: Nx2 --> D(Nx2)  by  parse(p) = {q | q < p}.

Now let  X-->Nx2  be a discrete fibration in Pos.
This means that, whenever  q<=p,  there is a function  X[q]->X[p],
and this system respects identities and composition.

The powerset functor of the ambient elementary topos is fibred,
so we can construct another discrete fibration
    Y-->D(Nx2)
in which    Y[U] = colim {Y[q] | q in U}.

In particular,  if  U = parse (0,1) = { (n,0) | n in N },
Y[U] is the colimit of Y[n,0]  for  n in N  and the maps between them.

Now, we need to say that  Y[parse(p)] = X[p], up to isomorphism.

But this is just the statement that

     X  --------->  Y
     |    |         |
     |    |         |
     |----+         |
     |              |
     |              |
     V   parse      V
    Nx2 -------> D(Nx2)

is a pullback.

The words "internal", "external" and "definable" has been used in this
discussion of the axiom scheme of replacement, but I believe that we
have to be very careful in using them.

So far as I can gather, Thomas Streicher is still discussing the
"sets and classes" view of replacement.  At any rate, I cannot see
what he might mean categorically by saying that
 > an external family of objects is a function I -> Ob(EE) where I is a
set
unless his Ob(EE) is a "class" in either the sense of algebraic set
theory (ie an object in another category besides EE) or some similar
approach.

AST is an intellectually valid point of view on which much good
category theory has been done in the past few years.  However,
Mike Shulman and I would both like to know how one might formulate
replacement WITHOUT classes.   If I have misunderstood you, Thomas,
then I apologise, but this is an important and difficult topic, so
more and clearer explanation is always valuable.  If I, who have
thought about this myself, do not follow you, then nor do many of
the other readers of this forum.

Before explaining why I think the word "definable" is also dangerous,
let me repeat something about the difference between set theory and
category theory.  In a word, they say that they are describing
mathematical objects up to equality, whilst we say that this can only
be done up to isomorphism.  However, in the context of replacement in
particular, this means that we may end up talking completely at cross
purposes.  As I said before, they claim that replacement is necessary
to construct the ordinal omega+omega, whilst this order structure can
be constructed up to isomorphism very easily without it.

But consider the example of the N-indexed sequence of iterated powersets
of N.  The structure that Replacement yields is, up to isomorphism,
just N itself, but the force of the axiom-scheme in set theory is that
the elements of this set are the iterated powersets.

I am not inclined to believe that Cantor understood the strength of
replacement when he stated in 1899 that "two equivalent [ie bijective]
multiplicities are either both sets or both equalivalent",  because
his mathematical beliefs were an extreme form of Platonism, and the
appreciation of the strength of logic theories simply did not exist
at the time.   Also, Fraenkel made a mistake in his first attempt
to formulate Replacement, saying something that was already derivable
from Zermelo's set theory.

I believe that, in order to grasp the meaning of Replacement and then
formulate it in categorical language, we first have to have a clear
understanding of the ways in which we make "definitions" and then
implement them.  The distinction between planning and execution is
very clear if you're building a house, but often very difficult to
make in mathematical research.

Instead of logic, let's consider algebra.  You can define the notion
of group using (1) just the symbols for identity and binary
multiplication.  Or, you can have (2) multiplications symbols of all
arities, but still with a single result; this is called the "clone".
Next, you can form (3) families of products; this is the "Lawvere
theory".  There are also (4) the category of all groups and (5) the
classifying topos.  Of these, (1) is finite, (2,3) require the natural
numbers or an axiom of infinity, and (4,5) require a set theory.
In some sense, they all capture the same algebraic notion, but
foundationally, something more is needed to prove their equivalence.

Thomas Streicher uses indexed/fibred category theory to link internal
and external notions.  I don't see, however, how he manages to give
the SPECIFICATION that a display map X-->N is the sequence of iterates
of the powerset on N.  The formulation that I gave at the end of my
previous posting and in Remark 9.6.16 in my book does do this.

Earlier in this thread, Paul Levy said,

There are two important ideas in category theory that have something
to say about consistency:
(1) Andre' Joyal's categorical formulation of Godel's INCOMPLETENESS
     theorem;  this compares
     - PROVABILITY, in the form of the internal term or free model of
       the system (an arithmetic universe, but it could equally be an
       elementary topos) with
     - TRUTH in the world within which this is constructed; and
(2) the Artin gluing / Freyd cover / scone (Sierpinski cone) / logical
     relations construction,  which can be used to prove CONSISTENCY
     of various theories, once again by comparing the term model with
     the ambient universe.

Whilst writing a book is career suicide, it does have the intellectual
value of forcing one to reconcile apparently conflicting results like
these.  (See sections 7.7 and 9.6 of my book.)

The gluing construction works because it uses the axiom-scheme of
replacement.  Thomas Streicher and Thorsten Altenkirch, who have
contributed to the present thread, have written papers about this
construction and its applications.  Did they or anybody else draw
attention to the need for Replacement in their work on this
construction?

Categorically, the gluing construction is a comma category that, in
the applications to consistency, combines the "semantic" category (eg
Set, with Replacement) with the "syntactic" one (the free one,
constructed from the types, terms and proofs of the theory under
consideration).  Roughly speaking, the comma category inherits any
structure that both of the original categories had, and the projection
to the syntactic category preserves it.  Since the syntactic category
is the free one, it therefoe has a unique (up to unique iso)
structure-preserving functor to the comma category. Combined with the
projection to the semantic category, this yields an internal model in
which the type constructors (powerset, for example) of the theory are
interpreted as the actual semantic powersets or whatever.

Steve Awodey, Bill Lawvere, Colin McLarty and Thomas Streicher have
presented various views on Replacement.  In order that the rest of us
might get a better understanding of what each of them means, and how
their points of view are related, I invite them each to give an
explanation of this foundational aspect of the gluing construction, as
they would formulate it according to their respective points of view.

Dear Jawad,

Here are some suggestions that hopefully may help you:

1) In regard of literature on the subject, I'd suggest to look at the book,=
 "A Guide to the Literature on Semirings and their Applications in Mathemat=
ics and Information Sciences (With Complete Bibliography)," by Kazimierz Gl=
azek, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2002.

2) Concerning categorical aspects of semimodules categories, I'd suggest to=
 check publications of Ildar S. Safuanov whose Ph.D. dissertation, supervis=
ed by late Prof. L.A. Skornyakov (Moscow State U., MGU) in 80-th, was about=
 categorical aspect of semimodules.

With my best wishes,

Yefim

Subject: categories: The Category of Semimodules over Semirings

Dear colleagues,

A semiring is roughly speaking a ring without subtraction, i.e. (R,+,0) is
an Abelian monoid & (R,*,1) is a semigroup with distribution of * over +
(e.g. the set of non-negative integers). A semimodule over a semiring is
roughly speaking a module without subtraction, i.e. (M,+,0) is an Abelian
Monoid, and there is a scalar multiplication of the semiring on M with the
usual expected properties. A semimodule over a semiring is cancellative, if
the Abelian monoid (R,+) is cancellative.

The category of N0-Semimoduels is just the category of "Commutative
Monoids".

Indeed the category of left semimodules over an arbitrary semiring R? (A
special example would be the category of commutative monoids) is not
pre-additive. However, for any left semimodules M and N over a semiring R,
(Hom_R(M,N),+,0) is an Abelian monoid and it has kernels and cokernels.

A monomorphism of semimodules is injective, however only an "image-regular"
epimorphism is subjective. For a morphism of semimodules f: M --> N, the
sequence 0 ---> Coimage(f) --> Im(f) --> is exact, but the canonical map
Coimage(f) --> Im(f) is not an isomorphism (neither a bimorphism), unless f
is regular.  The category of semimodules had products, equalizers and
products (however not necessarily coequalizers). The category of
cancellative semimodules is complete and cocomplete. It has a generator,
namely the semiring itself and I also "expect" it to have exact colimits
(ANY REFERENCE?).

What kind of Categories is the category of (cancellative) semimodules over
semiring? Is there a notion of "almost Grothendieck categories" or
"Semi-Grothendieck Categories" to which categories of (cancellative)
semimodules fit? Unfortunately, I did not find a single book that clarifies
the categorical aspects of semimodules (The 3 books of Golan as well as the
books on the subject by others are devoted more to semirings and automata
and not have much on semimodules).

I appreciate very much your comments, suggestions for literature (e.g.
books, Ph.D. dissertations, articles) on the CATEGROY OF (Cancellative)
SEMIMODULES (other than the papers of Takahashi and Katsov, which I already
have).

With best regards,

Jawad

I must be missing something here. Don't the (say, left-) semimodules
(over a given semiring) constitute an equationally definable class =

of algebras? That is, aren't they determined entirely by operations =

and equations?

If they DO, that is, if they ARE, then the category of them all (together=

with their homomorphisms) must, like all such "varietal categories," have=
 =

all (small) limits and colimits, and, in particular, all coequalizers.

Alas, I have little else to offer. Cheers, and Happy St. Paddy's Day,

As Fred says, the semimodules over a given semiring are=20
determined by operations and equations, and so are complete
and cocomplete. In terms of exactness properties they are
also=20

(i) locally finitely presentable (so that finite limits commute
with filtered colimits, and=20
(ii) Barr-exact (so that there is an equivalence between quotients
and congruences)

If we restrict to the cancellative case, we still have completeness
and  cocompleteness and (i), but (ii) fails. =20

Please accept my apologies for duplicate emails, as this announcement
has been sent to multiple mailing lists.

I would like to announce the following conference and a first call for papers.

ATMCS III
Algebraic Topological Methods in Computer Science
Paris, France 7-11 July 2008
http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~sanjeevi/atmcs/

***FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS***
Deadline for submission of abstract: 15 May 2008
Notification of acceptance: 5 June 2008
Deadline for registration: 15 June 2008
Conference: 7-11 July 2008
contact information: atmcs08@lix.polytechnique.fr

Recent research has shown that techniques from algebraic topology
adapt strikingly well in studying computational systems and other
subjects within Computer Science.  This third ATMCS conference hopes
to bring together researchers employing geometric/topological methods
in both abstract and concrete areas of computer science.  The week long
conference will feature some invited talks, several accepted talks, a
poster session, and countless opportunities for informal
collaboration; we plan to publish our proceedings in a refereed
journal, pending approval. All authors submitting an abstract by the
deadline will have an opportunity, at the least, to present a
(refereed) poster at the poster session.

***SCOPE***
Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, concurrency theory,
distributed computing and complexity, rewriting systems, image
analysis, and sensor networks.

***INVITED SPEAKERS***
A current (and incomplete) list of plenary speakers for the conference includes:

John Baez, University of California Riverside, U.S.A.
Gunnar Carlsson, Stanford University, U.S.A.
Herbert Edelsbrunner, Duke University, U.S.A.
Emmanuel Haucourt, CEA and Ecole Polytechnique, France
Rick Jardine, University of Western Ontario, Canada
Sanjeevi Krishnan, CEA and Ecole Polytechnique, France

***INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSIONS***
Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts summarizing current
work that explores connections between algebraic topology and computer
science.  All abstracts should be written in English and should not
exceed 1 single-spaced page.  Although abstracts preferrably should be
sent by email to atmcs08@lix.polytechnique.fr, abstracts may also be
mailed to the postal address:

Sanjeevi Krishnan

FOURTH INTERNATION WORKSHOP ON INTUITIONISTIC MODAL LOGIC AND APPLICATIONS =
(IMLA'08)
  http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vdp/IMLA08.html
  A LICS'08 affiliated workshop
  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, June 23, 2008
* Constructive modal logics and type theories are of increasing foundationa=
l
  and practical relevance in computer science. Applications are in type
  disciplines for programming languages, and meta-logics for reasoning abou=
t
  a variety of computational phenomena.
  Theoretical and methodological issues center around the question of
  how the proof-theoretic strengths of constructive logics can best be
  combined with the model-theoretic strengths of modal
  logics. Practical issues center around the question which modal
  connectives with associated laws or proof rules capture
  computational phenomena accurately and at the right level of
  abstraction.
  This workshop will bring together designers, implementers, and users
  to discuss all aspects of intuitionistic modal logics and type
  theories.
* Topics include, but are not limited to:
  - applications of intuitionistic necessity and possibility
  - monads and strong monads
  - constructive belief logics and type theories
  - applications of constructive modal logic and modal type theory to
    formal verification, foundations of security, abstract
    interpretation, and program analysis and optimization
  - modal types for integration of inductive and co-inductive types, higher=
\
  - order abstract syntax, strong functional programming
  - models of constructive modal logics such as algebraic,
    categorical, Kripke, topological, and realizability
    interpretations
  - notions of proof for constructive modal logics
  - extraction of constraints or programs from modal proofs
  - proof search methods for constructive modal logics and their
    implementations
* The workshop continues a series of previous LICS-affiliated
  workshops, which were held as part of FLoC'99, Trento, Italy and of
  FLoC'02, Copenhagen, Denmark.

WORKSHOP ON LOGIC AND SEARCH (LaSh08)
  Computation of structures from declarative descriptions
  Call For Papers
  Leuven, Belgium, November 6-7, 2008
  http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/LaSh08
* IMPORTANT DATES
  Submission: August 15, 2008
  Notification: September 15, 2008
  Workshop: November 6-7, 2008
* SCOPE
  In many real-life problems, we search for objects of complex nature --
  plans, schedules, assignments. Such objects are often represented as
  (finite) structures, which are implicitly specified by means of
  theories in some logic. Thus, languages are needed to describe
  structures, and algorithms to extract them from these implicit
  descriptions. Propositional Satisfiability (SAT), Constraint
  Programming (CP), and Answer Set Programming (ASP) are arguably the
  three most prominent areas that develop such languages and techniques.

  Each of these areas has been proposed as a declarative programming
  approach to solving NP-complete combinatorial problems. Such problems
  abound in computer science, engineering, operations research
  computational biology and other fields. In many cases, progress is
  limited by the difficulty of designing implicit representations of
  structures (modeling), which hinders common acceptance of the aproach,
  and the inability to solve sufficiently large instances of the
  problems in practical time bounds (search algorithms). Therefore,
  these three areas have as a major goal the development of practical
  modeling languages and methodologies that support the modeling, and
  algorithms and tools for efficient problem solving.

  Despite the similar goals of these areas, in many respects SAT, ASP and
  CP develop as three independent disciplines, focusing on rather different
  particular problems or questions.  There are few, if any, researchers
  who are experts in all three areas. To date, we are not aware of any
  meeting which specifically aims at bringing these three areas together.
* Objectives
  LaSh08 aims to offer a discussion forum for research in SAT, ASP and
  CP that focuses on the computation of structures from declarative
  descriptions.  We invite contributions on modeling languages,
  methodologies, theoretical analysis, techniques, algorithms and
  systems. The forum is an occasion to exchange ideas on the
  state-of-the-art; to discuss specific technical problems; to formulate
  challenges and opportunities ahead; to analyse differences and
  simularities between the different areas; to study opportunities for
  synergy and integration.
* In particular, we would like to foster exchange at least on the
  following topics:
  - integrations of  SAT, ASP and/or CP technologies
  - comparisons of modeling languages
  - criteria for choice of modeling languages
    (for modeling convenience or efficiency)
  - new algorithm directions
  - efficient modeling  strategies
  - new  applications
  - complexity results, tractable subsets
  - completeness results (e.g. capturing complexity classes)
  - methods for taking advantage of tractability results
  - solver implementation techniques,
  - algorithms for grounding
  - modeling languages and constructs
          (aggregates, global constraints,..)
  - search control and heuristics in the context of model generation
  - symmetry breaking in model construction
  - optimisation problems in model construction:
    - languages for optimality criteria;
    - algorithms for computing optimal models
* Systems and Tools:
  LaSh08 will also provide an opportunity for presentation of implemented
  systems and tools at a demo session. Thus, we invite submissions of
  systems and tools that reflect the above ideas, and aim at facilitating
  declarative problem solving, and making it practical and used.

This is off-topic only to the extent that it concerns a publication
medium that is as open to articles on the animal liberation movement as
it is to those on toposes, subobject classifiers (separate from
toposes!) and abelian categories.

Wikipedia's flexibility has its pros and cons.  While it is potentially
as corruptible as communism, by its nature it is dominated by the
intelligentsia rather than either the bourgeoisie or the proletariat.
Common sense being uniformly albeit sparsely distributed among all three
classes, there is no apriori reason why domination of this kind should
handicap it any more than its competitors.

A significant advantage of Wikipedia is that it was there first (among
those open encyclopedias that have amounted to anything) and has become
the Microsoft of its genre much faster than Microsoft itself.  The fact
that some academics remain skeptical of its quality is not in practice a
serious differentiator from its competitors.

Articles vary widely in quality.  I'm presently involved in a dispute
over replacing an account of Boolean algebra at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_logic with my version of that story
at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_%28introduction%29 .
The latter did not exactly spring full grown from my brow---I started
out with
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebras_canonically_defined as a
kind of protest against what I perceived as outdated and parochial views
of the subject but then realized that this was pretty avant garde
compared to what was needed and toned it down to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_%28logic%29 .  But pretty
soon it became clear to me that this too was pitched at too high a level
for Wikipedia and I tried again with
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_%28introduction%29 .  I'm
sure that can be simplified too, but the author of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_logic has utterly failed to
convince me that his account is the way to go.

Meanwhile I've wrestled with other appalling accounts of topics such as
residuated lattices (I completely replaced an article that in effect
defined them to be Heyting algebras) and relation algebras (replacing an
article that faithfully transcribed all the metamathematical Greek
letters in Tarski and Givant's "Set Theory without Variables" in favor
of notation more appropriate to an account of a variety).  Then there's
articles on dynamic logic, Zhegalkin polynomials, and Zhegalkin himself.

Another timesink is the pseudoscience that well-intentioned but
under-calibrated editors have to struggle with, such as the Wolfram
prize for a supposedly tiny universal Turing machine, and Burgin's
notion of "super-recursive algorithm" as his proposed counterexample to
the Church-Turing thesis.

In short, much like the real world, which still hasn't converged on
Utopia despite trying hard and wishing harder.  Wikipedia and the world
are difficult but vibrant and growing communities and I hold out great
hopes for the future of both.

As I understand the internal logic of a topos it consists of certain
morphisms from finite powers of Omega to Omega.  In the case of Set it
consists of all such morphisms.  For which toposes is this not the case,
and for those how are the morphisms that do belong to the internal logic
best characterized?

I do hope it's not necessary to start from the notion of an internal
Heyting algebra, that sounds so counter to mathematical practice and
intuition.

If the internal logic consists of precisely those morphisms preserved by
geometric morphisms this will give me the necessary motivation to go to
the mats with geometry.

Dear Prof. Linton,
Many thanks for your comments about the existence of coequalizers in
categories of semimodules.

What I mentioned (that the category of left semimodules over an arbitrary
semiring has in general no coequalizers) was due to CONFUSION caused by the
way some results in "M. Takahashi, Completeness and $C$-co completeness of
the category of semimodules. Math. Sem. Notes Kobe Univ. 10 (1982), no. 2,
551--562." are stated.

In that paper, Takahashi proved that the category of left semimodules over
an arbitrary semiring has $c$-coequalizers and is $c$-cocomplete (where $c :
R-smod ---> C-R-smod$ denote the functor that assigns to each semimodule its
associated cancellative semimodule).

Indeed his proof does not exclude that this category has coequalizers as I
(apparently incorrectly) stated. For your convenience, I summarize what
Takahashi did in the above mentioned paper:

Denote the category of left semimodules over a semirings $R$ by $R-smod$ and
its full subcategory of cancellative semimodules by $C-R-smod$. Then
$R-smod$ has products and equalizers, whence complete. Let $c : R-smod --->
C-R-smod$ denote the functor that assigns to each semimodule its associated
cancellative semimodule. This functor is left adjoint to the embedding
functor $U : C-R-smod ---> R-smod$. Then $R-smod$ has coproducts and
$c$-coequalizers, whence $c$-cocomplete.

The confusion is caused by his statement that "$c$-cocompleteness is a
relaxation of cocompleteness" and the last Corollary in the paper, in which
he deduced that the full subcategory $C-R-smod$ of CANCELLATIVE semimodules
has coequalizers and is cocomplete!!

Anyway, I am so grateful for your comments and would appreciate as well any
comment about exactness of colimits in $C-R-smod$ and $C-R-smod$ (in the
category of modules over rings, colimits are exact!!) will be highly
appreciated.

Wassalam,
Jawad

I must be missing something here. Don't the (say, left-) semimodules (over a
given semiring) constitute an equationally definable class of algebras? That
is, aren't they determined entirely by operations and equations?

If they DO, that is, if they ARE, then the category of them all (together
with their homomorphisms) must, like all such "varietal categories," have
all (small) limits and colimits, and, in particular, all coequalizers.

Alas, I have little else to offer. Cheers, and Happy St. Paddy's Day,

Dear Paul,

I am trying to answer at least some of your questions.

You can't say this "categorically" as far as I can see. I am working
informally on the meta-level and there both I and Ob(EE) are ome sets
and it is clear what is a function from I to Set. If necessary I can also
reveil the strength of my meta-level reasoning: ZFC plus the axiom that
every set appears as member of some Grothendieck universe.

Well, for the set theorist it's impossible anyway since he needs at
least the class V of all sets which, of course, is carefully hidden
as the (interpretation of the) single sort over which the variables
of the language of set theory range. Well, and by using first order
definable properties one has a lot of further classes not given official
status but which are there as interpretations of those formulas. That's
precisely the starting point of AST postulating a Heyting category EE
and a "universe" V in it which has enough properties for V being a model
of IZF. (Well, AST in its orginal form has also the ambition to construct
this class V as a quotient of a W-type.)

Only when reading your most recent mail it became clear to me that your
intentions are quite different from ETCS. McLarty's replacement axiom does
speak about external families which are syntactically definable in the
language of ETCS whereas you - as I understand it - want to stick to
internal families (aka display maps). The intention of my mail from Saturday
was to argue that the external notion of family is (at least) problematic
in a non-wellpointed context.

Using universes in toposes (as in my paper with this title) one can
formulate everything without using the external families and so one can
in AST.

Of course, one can construct even larger prim.rec. orders but one
cannot prove their implementation as von Neumann ordinals. And that's
what they want.

But it's very easy to express this specification in the internal language
of a topos namely as

   \forall n:N \exists i : X_{n+1} -> P(X_n)  Iso(i)

in PTJ's Elephant  3.6.3 (f) you find a description of sconing in a fibred
setting, i.e. over an arbitrary base: if p : EE -> SS is a geom. morph. then
sc_SS(EE) is just the glueing of  p_* : EE -> SS
that's my answer to the question of how I would define sconing relative
to an arbitrary base

this certainly doesn't answer you question above; I can just give an honest
answer: when using glueing I always used full power on the meta level including
the common identification of families of sets indexed by I and maps to I

asa far as AST is concerned there is no proof yet that models of AST are
stable under soning; a first attempt you can find in a paper by M. Warren

   Michael A. Warren.
   Coalgebras in a category of classes.
   Annals of Pure and Applied Logic, 146(1):60-71, 2007.

That's what Benno van den Berg just told me when asking him about it.

Sconing for the free topos with nno is of course not the issue here. But
to show that models of AST are stable under sconing is subtle. The key point
is that you seem to take for Set a big enough category containg a nontrivial
notion of small map. Otherwise there are problems to define an object of
small objects.

Dear Vaughan,

I don't think one can give a straight answer to this question: it all
depends on what you mean by `the logic of a topos'. I presume you're
thinking of the fact that, in Set, any function 2^n --> 2 is a polynomial
in the Boolean operations (i.e., is the interpretation of some n-ary term
in the theory of Boolean algebras). One could ask the same question about
a general topos, with `Heyting' replacing `Boolean'; but the answer
would mostly be `no', even for Boolean toposes. On the other hand, one
might well *define* `the internal logic of a topos' as meaning the
collection of all natural operations on subobjects -- that is, the
collection of all morphisms \Omega^n --> \Omega.

Incidentally, there is nothing unnatural or counterintuitive about `the
notion of internal Heyting algebra: it is a very natural consequence of
the definition of a subobject classifier, see A1.6.3 in the Elephant.

I thought this was exactly what Colin's version of the replacement

Osius uses a different construction than M&M: instead of explicitly
building "membership trees" he uses objects equipped with a transitive
well-founded relation to represent transitive sets, and subobjects of
them to represent arbitrary sets.  In general you do have to add a
"transitive representation" axiom to ensure that every object of the
topos can be reconstructed from the resulting model of bZ---but this
is unnecessary if you also assume choice, since then every object can
be well-ordered and thus admits a transitive well-founded relation.

Mike Shulman pointed me out a faulty formulation in my lengthy mail
from last Saturday; I take the opportunity of formulating it correctly:

In your Replacement axiom (p.48 of your "Philosophia" article) you psotulta
the existence of a map f : S -> A such that S_x \cong x^*f  for all x : 1->X.
Can you prove that this f is unique up to isomorphism, i.e. that wellpointedness
for maps entails wellpointedness for families?

Dear Peter,

Your answers come as something of a relief, in that on the one hand it
seemed unlikely that every morphism \Omega^n --> \Omega would arise as a
Heyting polynomial, yet I didn't see why that should be taken as grounds
for calling such counterexamples nonlogical.  This was the nature of my
concern about Heyting algebras, that they might feature somehow in the
antecedent of someone's definition of logicality.

I'm more than happy to have Heyting algebras arise as a natural
consequence of something even more natural such the notion of topos.
I've known and loved Heyting algebras much longer than I have toposes,
yet I now see toposes as being prior to Heyting algebras in the causal
chain of things, and would be most uncomfortable with a definition of
logicality in a topos that arbitrarily took the notion of Heyting
algebra as a criterion in any essential way.

So I find the thought that there could be logical morphisms in a topos
that aren't Heyting polynomials quite comforting, as it tends to put
Heyting algebras in their place as themselves a natural *part* of the
internal logic of a topos thus understood without however being the
whole of it.

In a private reply Andrej Bauer made the nice point, obvious in
retrospect, that the logical morphisms as the morphisms \Omega^n -->
\Omega shouldn't assume n is finite or even discrete, to allow
quantification over any type.  He also brought up the matter of higher
order logic which hadn't been on my agenda but probably should be at
some point.

I guess I am getting old and dumb.  This question should have been a snap
for me years ago.  It is old fashioned, only a 1-categorical question and
not about internal vs. external.

Suppose F: A --> B is left adjoint to U: B --> A.  Suppose a is an object
of A and b, b' objects of B such that there is an equalizer
   a ---> Ub ===> Ub'.  (The two arrows Ub to UB' are not assumed to be U
of arrows from B.)  Does it follow that a ---> UFa ===> UFUFa is an
equalizer?  The arrows are \eta a, UF\eta a and \eta UFa of course.

As to replacement in ETCS:  ETCS is formulated in the first order
language (with equality) of category theory.  Take it as a one-sorted
language (arrows) with composition C(g,f;h).  It makes no principled
difference for our purposes but is extremely handy to also assume
constants 1 of set type (axiomatized as terminal) and "true" of function
type (axiomatized as an element of a truth value set) and partially
defined operators for say, pullbacks and the evaluation functions for
function sets.

ZF is formulated in the first order language (with equality) with
set-membership epsilon.  Replacement in ETCS like replacement in ZF is
an axiom scheme positing one axiom for each formula of a certain form in
the first order language of the theory.

ZF-replacement posits one quantified axiom for each formula Rxy with two
free variables (necessarily variables over sets, since that is what ZF
has, and if you like you may allow other variables as parameters).  The
axiom for Rxy says "For any set S, if R relates each element x\in S to a
unique set y then there is a set X whose elements are exactly those sets
y that are R-related to some x\in S."


ETCS posits one quantified axiom for each formula Rfy with f of arrow
type (the axiom will say f has domain 1 so f stands for some element of
a set) and y of set type.  The axiom for Rfy says "For any set S, if R
relates each function f:1-->S to a set y unique up to isomorphism then
there is an S-indexed set of sets X-->S where the fiber over each x is
isomorphic to the related set y."

The apparatus of discrete fibrations applies here and no doubt to good
advantage for serious work.  But very little is needed in stating the axiom
scheme.

Let me say again that my account of replacement is just Bill's from 1965
only cast as replacement rather than reflection since people are far
more familiar with replacement (and using the simplifications to ETCS
that came with elementary topos theory).

Isn't the following a counterexample?

Let A = Set and let B = A\{0} (the category of nonempty sets).  Let F
send the empty set in A to the singleton set in B, and otherwise let F
and U be the evident identity functors between A and B.  Similarly let
\eta and \epsilon be the identity natural transformations, except for
\eta_0 which can only be the unique function from 0 to 1.   Naturality
of \eta and \epsilon depends on both being the identity, except for
\eta_0 but that's from the initial object so all its diagrams commute.

Then 0 equalizes the two arrows from U1 to U2 but \eta_0 does not
equalize UF\eta a and \eta UFa since the latter two are both 1_1 in A
whence they are equalized by 1.

Sure.  It takes the axiom of choice of course, since without choice the
result may be false (even two countably infinite families of countably
infinite sets need not be isomorphic).

It is the obvious argument by Zorn's lemma, which follows from choice:

Given two families S-->A and S'-->A with corresponding fibers
isomorphic, consider the set of all pairs <U,i> with U a subset of A,
and i an isomorphism over U from the restriction of S to the restriction
of S'.  By Zorn at least one of these is maximal (for the obvious
ordering by inclusion) so call it <U,i>.  Since well-pointedness implies
Boolean, U has a complement in A--which must be empty or else we could
extend the isomorphism.

best, Colin

Dear Thomas,

I'm glad that we've now started to talk a common language about
Replacement, and am hopeful that it will be possible to come to
some agreement, but I think that we are still some way off doing so.

Since you have changed the Subject: line several times, I would like
first to give some help to anyone who might be trying to follow this
discussion from an archive in the future, by listing the Subject:
lines of recent postings.  Of course, they have "categories:" and
"re:" added to them.

  Categorial foundations
  categorical formulations of Replacement
  Heyting algebras and Wikipedia
  I was partly wrong
  internal versus external
  question to Colin about uniqueness in his Replacement axiom
  replacement and iterated powersets
  replacement and the gluing construction
  replacing set theory
  the axiom scheme of replacement in category theory
  trying to answer some of Paul's questions

When I was trying to understand replacement, ten years ago and more,
I found, both from my own experience and in looking that the work of
others, that it is easy to fall into one of two traps:

(1) lack of rigour;  using the words "external" or "meta-language" may
indicate this;

(2) lack of force;  using the word "definable" may indicate this.

You can talk rigorously about external or meta- things if you first set
up a two-level formal system.  Examples of such systems include
(1) first order logic and set theory expressed within it;
(2) first order logic and category theory expressed within it;
(3) a category with an internal category;
(4) a fibred category containing a universe in the sense that
     you and I discussed in the 1980s;
(5) a pretopos or arithmetic universe with a class of small maps
     (algebraic set theory).

A large part of the explanation for ideological conflicts between
mathematicians is that they work in different OUTER systems.  If
they can agree on the outer system, they have an arena in which to
compare their INNER systems.  Reading between the lines of your
posting suggests that you are not completely confident yourself
of the rigour of your own account.

One of the uses of a two-level system is to discuss logical questions
such a consistency.  For example, Godel's theorem is about truth and
provability, which may be seen as facts about the outer and inner
systems
respectively.  Andre' Joyal set this up in category theory by looking
at the free arithmetic universe inside an arithmetic universe.

The axiom-scheme of replacement seems to be about making the inner world
agree with part of the outer one.

I really do not have much idea of what you mean by statements like
       \forall n:N \exists i : X_{n+1} -> P(X_n)  Iso(i).
Nor do I understand similar statements to this in either
"An elementary theory of the category of sets (extended version)"
or "Exploring categorical structuralism"
by Bill Lawvere and Colin McLarty respectively.

It would help if you were all to give more "turorial" explanations of
these things, and precise internal references to relevant papers and
books, because these are often lengthy and largely devoted to simpler
categorical structure than replacement.

We agree, I believe, that fibred methods are they way that we can
express
in category theory ideas that the set theorists encode as sets of sets.
Thus a display map  p:X-->N  captures the same idea as
   { {{x, {x, n}}  |  x in X & p(x)=n } | n in N },
or whatever hieroglyphics the set theorists would use.

Similarly,  the idea of a functor from a small category to a large one,
say  F:CC-->Set,  can be captured as a discrete fibration   p:FF-->CC.

In order to have any chance of fitting the axiom scheme of replacement
into our skulls,  we have to take the technology (fibred category
theory,
for example) as read,  even though it is rather difficult and
complicated
itself.   The problem is that most accounts add replacement as a brief
footnote to a lengthy treatment of more basic topics.   My book is
guilty of this, and so, with all due respect, are you, I believe.

With regard to the example of the iterated powerset,  the statement of
yours that I quoted above claims to express this,  but I do not
understand the language.  I would like you to translate it into the
usual language of category theory, ie functors, pullbacks etc.

I suspect that what you will come up with is the same as in my posting
about this on Sunday afternoon.   I accept that I have taken the
technology of fibred category theory off the shelf to do this, but

*********************************************************************
*  I believe that I made a significant original contribution        *
*  (in my book) by formulating the equation X_{n+1} = P(X_n) as     *
*  a pullback along the structure map of a well founded coalegbra.  *
*********************************************************************

The example of the gluing construction illustrates the difficulty caused
by treating replacment as a footnote to a more elementary theory.
There is, as you say, no foundational difficulty in constructing the
comma category arising from a functor  U:AA-->SS.   Although I have
copied most of what I have to say about replacement in Section 9.6
of the book in these postings, I am not going to do so for my account
of the gluing construction, as it is mathematically too complicated
to do so. You will have to get the book itself and read section 7.7.

The foundational issue about this construction is its application to
consistency issues of various theories.   In these,  SS  is a "semantic"
model of the theory in question, maybe the universe "Set" in which we
claim to live,  and  AA  is the "syntactic" or "term" model.

We have to be careful about calling AA the "free" or "initial" model,
as this is exactly the foundational point.

The gluing construction is the comma category (SS,U) whose objects are
SS-maps of the form  X-->U(Gamma),  where Gamma is an object of AA and
X one of SS.   I use the letter Gamma because it is typically a context
of the theory under study.   One can show that  (U,SS)  typically
inherits the structure of this theory, and pi_1:(SS,U)-->AA preserves
it.

Since  (U,SS)  is a model of the theory,  whilst  AA is the term model,
there ought to be an interpretation functor   [[-]]:AA-->(U,SS).
We have no difficulty in saying what such a functor would be in
substance, since we can express it as a fibration  EE-->AA of small
categories.   However, this illustates the difficulty with the
word "definable" - if you already had this fibration then there
would be nothing left for Replacment to do.

The problem is whether the functor or fibration exists.   Now, as AA
is the term model, we can use recursion over its well founded system
of types, terms and proofs. For example,  if we already know  [[Gamma]]
and [[Delta]],  we can form the interpretation of the arrow type
Gamma -> Delta as the exponential
    [[ Gamma -> Delta ]]   =   [[Delta]] ^ [[Gamma]].

However, this is not a valid form of recursion, since recursion defines
new TERMS of pre-existing types.   We want to form new TYPES.  This
involves the axiom scheme of replacement.

******************************************************************
*  Again, I claim an original contribution in my book in         *
*  recognising that this application of the gluing construction  *
*  to logic requires the axiom scheme of replacement.            *
******************************************************************

Notice that replacement is not only a scheme indexed by types,  it is
also parametric in the theory under study:   each theory has its own
replacement scheme.   If the original theory was algebra,  we can
characterise the corresponding notion of replacement as what are
variously known as dependent products, partial products or W-types.

But also, the operation of formulating replacement turns one theory into
another, so it can be iterated.  Ten years ago, I briefly believed that
this leads to inconsistency in ZF.   I suspect that this is a necessary
though not sufficient "rite of passage" - ie that, only after
temporarily
believing that it is  inconsistent, can one claim to understand what
the Axiom of Replacement says.

Actually, F isn't even a functor.  The unique arrow 0 --> Ub has to give a
canonical arrow F0 = 1 --> b, which there isn't.  You could choose one, of
course, but it could not be functorial.

Actually, I realized the answer to my question cannot be yes.  Here's why.
Let A be some complete category to be specified later.  Let d be a fixed
object of A.  Let B be set\op and Fa = Hom(a,d).  The right adjoint is
given by b |---> d^b.  It is not entirely trivial to show this, but if my
answer were "yes", then you could show that the class of objects that were
equalizers of powers of d would be complete.  It is obviously closed under
products but, over 40 years ago, Isbell gave an example in which it was
not closed under equalizers.

This much is true: if there is an equalizer of the form a --> UFa ===> Ub,
then a ---> UFa ===> UFUFa is an equalizer.

So it *is* a counterexample---to the notion that any old graph theorist
can do category theory.  Focusing on the naturality, I forgot about
functoriality (done that before).  More embarrassing is not thinking to
perform the easiest test of all category theory, F(0) = 0.  And most
embarrassing is thinking that Mike could have overlooked such an easy
example.  Sorry, Mike!

Second Call for Papers
------------------------
4th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2008)
Leicester, United Kingdom,
September 7 - 13, 2008
-----------------------
The 4th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2008)
will be held in Leicester (United Kingdom) in the second week of
September 2008,  along with several satellite events. It continues the
line of conferences previously held in Barcelona (Spain) in 2002, Rome
(Italy) in 2004, and Natal  (Brazil) in 2006 as well as a series of six
International Workshops on Graph Transformation with Applications in
Computer Science between 1978 and 1998, and alternates with the workshop
series on Application of Graph Transformation with Industrial Relevance.
The conference takes place under the auspices of EATCS, EASST, and IFIP
WG 1.3. Awards will be given by EATCS and EASST for the best theoretical
and application-oriented papers. Proceedings are planned with Springer's
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

Scope:

Graphs are among the simplest and most universal models for a variety of
systems, not just in computer science, but throughout engineering and
the life sciences. When systems evolve we are interested in the way they
change, to predict, support, or react to their evolution. Graph
transformation combines the idea of graphs as a universal modelling
paradigm with a rule-based approach to specify evolution. The area is
concerned with both the theory of graph transformation and their
application to a variety of domains.

The conference aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners
interested in the foundations and application of graph transformation to
a variety of areas. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to

    * foundations and theory of
          o General models of graph transformatio
          o High-level and adhesive replacement systems
          o Node-, edge-, and hyperedge replacement grammars
          o Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformations
          o Term graph rewriting
          o Hierarchical graphs and decompositions of graphs
          o Logic expression of graph transformation properties
          o Graph theoretical properties of graph languages
          o Geometrical and topological aspects of graph transformation
          o Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages
          o Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems
          o Structuring and modularization concepts for transformation
systems
          o Graph transformation and Petri nets

    * application to, languages and tool support for
          o Software architecture
          o Workflows and business processes
          o Software quality and testing
          o Software evolution
          o Access control and security models
          o Aspect-oriented development
          o Model-driven development, especially model transformations
          o Domain-specific languages
          o Implementation of programming languages
          o Bioinformatics and system biology
          o Natural computing
          o Image generation and pattern recognition techniques
          o Massively parallel computing
          o Self-adaptive systems and ubiquitous computing
          o Service-oriented applications and semantic web
          o Rule- and knowledge-based systems


Submitted papers should not exceed fifteen (15) pages using Springer's
LNCS format, and should contain original research. Simultaneous
submission to other conferences with proceedings or submission of
material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed.

Dear Paul,

I do have reveiled my meta-theory, namely ZFC together with the axiom that
every set appears as element of some Grothendieck universe. This is not a
question of belief but of convenience. I haven't found anything in category
theory which needs expressivity beyond that.

You ask what I mean by the validity of the statement

    \forall n:N \exists i : P(X_n)^{X_{n+1}} Iso(i)

Well, it has to be read in the internal language of a topos augmented with
some `macros' form the language of dependent types (here X -> N is some map
in the topos and the formula specifies that it's the family P(N)_{n \in N}.
Of course, one might take the pains of Kripke-Joyaling this internal statement
BUT why should one want to do so.

You are quite right in emphasizing that specifying such a family is one
thing and its existence is another one. For the latter purpose one needs
the eaxiom of replacement though possibly not its full strength. That's the
motivation for my considerations in my "Universes in Toposes". Postulating
a class of display maps SS with a strongly generic family E -> U (i.e. this
map is in SS and all maps can be obtained as pullback of it) and some
desired closure properties. Now supposing N \in U and U being closed under
powerset P(-) its is a most simple exercise to construct a map  f : N -> U
with  f(0) = N  and  f(n+1) = P(f(n)). We have just exploited that P restricts
to a map U -> U. This is known since around 1970 when Martin-Loef introduced
universes. Of course, he now would not consider something impredicative as
the power set functor P but he would consider X \mapsto X^X as an operation
on U.

Apparently, quite a few category people are not that fond of universes in
this sense. So one may ask the question to which extent one may express
recursively defined families without universes. The answer given in Paul's
book is to require initial fixpoints of endofunctors on some category of
families. In case of the example above it would be an endofunctor on EE/N
where EE is the topos under consideration. (See
www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/itpowtop.pdf (temporary!)
for one possible way of putting it.)

Such an external handling of recursive family is certainly possible
but I find it inconvenient because I want to construct my recursive families
inside the internal language. In mathematics you never work externally but
always internally, i.e. in one single unspecified formal system like ZFC
or strengthenings of it (see above). "External" is a logician's idea who
considers formal systems, their models and relations between them. But when
doing mathematics it's not a good idea to "go external".

Thomas

PS I find interesting you comments about glueing and the necessity of
replacement. I haven't come across this because on the meta-level I use
a very strong system where I have it anyway. You are right that via glueing
you get a consistency proof for HAH (higher order arithmetic). But this
a priori doesn't require replacemnt since Zermelo set theory is sufficient
for this purpose.

---------------------------------------

This ICALP 2008 affiliated joint event combines two (established) workshop
series:

QUANTUM PHYSICS AND LOGIC (QPL'08): This event has as its goal to bring
together researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum
computing and the use of logical tools, new structures, formal languages,
semantical  methods and other computer science methods for the study
quantum behaviour in general.  Over the past couple of years there has
been a growing activity in these foundational approaches together with a
renewed interest in the foundations of quantum theory, which complement
the more mainstream research in quantum  computation.  A predecessor of
this event, with the same acronym, called Quantum Programming Languages,
was held in  Ottawa (2003),  Turku (2004),  Chicago (2005) and Oxford
(2006); with the change of name and a new program committee we wish to
emphasise the intended much broader scope of this event, aiming to nourish
interaction between modern computer science logic, quantum computation and
information, and structural foundations for quantum physics.

DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPUTATIONAL MODELS (DCM'08):  Besides quantum computing,
several  new  models  of computation have emerged in the last few years,
and many developments of traditional computational models have been
proposed with the aim of taking into account the new demands of computer
systems users and the new capabilities of computation engines. A new
computational model, or a new feature in a traditional one, usually is
reflected in new structural paradigms.  The aim of this workshop is to
bring together researchers who are currently developing new computational
models or new features for traditional computational models, in order to
foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and
work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current
activities in this area.  Previous editions in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were
also affiliated to ICALP.

Dates:

- Submission deadline: March 31
- Acceptance/rejection notification: April 21
- Pre-proceedings versions due: June 15
- Workshop: July 12-13 2007

Submission format:

Prospective speakers are invited to submit a 2-5 pages abstract which
provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest and provides
sufficient detail to allows the program  committee to assess the merits of
the work.  Submissions of works in progress are encouraged but must be
more substantial than a research proposal.  We both encourage submissions
of original research as well as research submitted elsewhere.  Authors of
accepted original research contributions will be invited to submit a full
paper to a special issue of a journal yet to be decided on.  Submissions
should be in Postscript or PDF format and should be sent to Bob Coecke
<coecke@comlab.ox.ac.uk> by  March 31.  Receipt of all submissions will be
acknowledged by return email. Accepted contributors will be able to
publish extended versions of their abstracts in Electronic Notes in
Theoretical Computer Science.

The workshop enjoys support from:
EPSRC Network Semantics of Quantum Computation (EP/E006833/1)
EPSRC ARF The Structure of Quantum Information and its Applications to IT (EP/D072786/1)

Since 2002, FoLLI (the European Association for Logic,
Language, and Information, www.folli.org) awards the
E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize to outstanding
dissertations in the fields of Logic, Language, and
Information. We invite submissions for the best
dissertation which resulted in a Ph.D. degree in the
year 2007. The dissertations will be judged on technical
depth and strength, originality, and impact made in at
least two of the three fields of Logic, Language, and
Computation. Inter-disciplinarity is an important
feature of the theses competing for the E. W. Beth
Dissertation Prize.

Who qualifies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nominations of candidates are admitted who were awarded
a Ph.D. degree in the areas of Logic, Language, or
Information between January 1st, 2007 and December
31st, 2007. There is no restriction on the nationality
of the candidate or the university where the Ph.D.

Second Workshop on
MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
6 July 2008,  Reykjavik - Iceland
A satellite workshop of ICALP 2008

PRESENTATION
The workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming is
devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of remarkable
power and abstraction. Monadic programming in Haskell is the
paradigmatic example, but there are many more mathematical insights
manifest in programs and in programming language design:
Freyd-categories in reactive programming, symbolic differentiation
yielding context structures, and comonadic presentations of dataflow, to
name but three. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to
reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.

The first MSFP workshop was held in Kuressaare, Estonia, in July 2006.
An associated special issue of the Journal of Functional Programming is
in preparation.

INVITED SPEAKERS
Andrej Bauer, University of Ljubljana
Dan Piponi, Industrial Light and Magic

Dear Categorists,

Has anyone explored, either formally or informally, the connection betwee=
n
the Melzak Bypass Principle (MBP) and adjoints?

The MBP (aka "the conjugacy principle" which embraces and generalizes
Jacobi inversion) Ref MR696771  =20
http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/696771.pdf  (and no, it does not appear
in either Wikipedia or PlanetMath, yet) is somewhat heuristic in
character, suggesting : Transform the problem (T), Solve(S), Transform
back(T^1), as a "bypass" given by  (T^1)ST, which looks like conjugation.
Melzak himself refers to adjoints (quite tangentially) as "being bypasses=
,
though dressed up and served forth exotically" p.106 ibid. (I do recall
that adjoints were generally seen as pretty exotic in the early 1970's
when I was a graduate student at UBC, to my great chagrin). The MBP is
acclaimed in MM vol.57 No.3 May 1984 as "a device for exploring
analogies", or as "a dazzling attempt to comprehend complexity".  Perhaps
"bypass" could also be seen in the words of W.W. Tait (1996) "the
propositions about the abstract objects translate into propositions about
the things from which they are abstracted and, in particular, the truth o=
f
the former is founded on the truth of the latter".
http://home.uchicago.edu/~wwtx/frege.cantor.dedekind.pdf . For me,
"bypass" is a kenning for quasi-inverse or ad joint pairs.

Motivation for seeking such a connection is not really to revive a 25 or
30 year old idea (as brilliant as Melzak's insights were, of course), but
rather "to facilitate invention and discovery" (in Melzak's own words),
and to find additional (as well as interdisciplinary) sources of instance=
s
of adjoints, possibly as a way to make adjoints more immediately relevant
in any introductory discussion of categories, since, of course, adjoints
are undoubtedly one of the most successful concepts within category
theory. Further inspiration could be found in the Brown/Porter "Analogy"
paper http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/eureka-meth1.pdf and others, along
with a passion for  invention and discovery through the continued pursuit
of Unity and Identity of Opposites (UIO) -  obviously referring to Bill
Lawvere. Furthermore, I would also like to see this connection developed
for practical reasons,  applied to various situations, in particular to
the structure of the www as an anthropomorphic creation that could benefi=
t
from further categorical perspective, given by the learned categorists I
respect the most.

I look forward to your  thoughts and comments. ..... Al
