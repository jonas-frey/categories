                                    ICLP'08

              24th International Conference on Logic Programming
                     Udine, Italy, December 9th-13th, 2008
                          http://iclp08.dimi.uniud.it


CONFERENCE SCOPE
----------------
Since  the  first  conference  held  in  Marseilles  in 1982, ICLP has been the
premier  international conference for presenting research in logic programming.
Contributions (papers, position papers, and posters) are sought in all areas of
logic programming including but not restricted to:

* Theory: Semantic Foundations, Formalisms, Nonmonotonic Reasoning,
   Knowledge Representation.
* Implementation: Compilation, Memory Management, Virtual Machines, Parallelism.
*  Environments:  Program  Analysis,  Program  Transformation,  Validation  and
   Verification, Debugging, Profiling, Integration.
* Language  Issues:  Extensions, Integration with Other Paradigms, Concurrency,
   Modularity,  Objects,  Coordination,  Mobility,  Higher Order, Types, Modes,
   Programming Techniques.
* Related Paradigms:  Abductive Logic Programming, Inductive Logic Programming,
   Constraint Logic Programming, Answer-Set Programming.
* Applications:   Databases,    Data   Integration  and   Federation,  Software
   Engineering,  Natural  Language  Processing,  Web  and Semantic Web, Agents,
   Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics

The three broad categories for submissions are:
   (1) Technical papers,  providing  novel research  contributions,  innovative
       perspectives  on the field,  and/or novel integrations  across different
       areas;
   (2) Application  papers,  describing  innovative uses  of  logic programming
       technology in real-world application domains;
   (3) Posters, ideal for presenting and discussing current work, not yet ready
       for publication, for PhD thesis summaries and research project overviews.

A  separate  session  dedicated  to  the celebration of the 20th anniversary of
stable model semantics will also be part of the program.

Accepted  papers and posters will be allocated time for presentation during the
conference.  At  least  one  author  of each accepted submission is expected to
register and participate in the event.

In  addition  to papers and posters, the technical program will include invited
talks,  advanced  tutorials,  specialized  sessions,  workshops, and a Doctoral
Student  Consortium.  Details,  as  they  become  available  will be posted at:

                          http://iclp08.dimi.uniud.it

PAPERS AND POSTERS
------------------
Papers and posters must describe original, previously unpublished research, and
must  not  be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere. Emphasis will
be  placed  on  the  novelty  and innovative nature of the results (even if not
completely polished and refined).
All  submissions  will  be peer-reviewed by an international panel. Submissions
MUST contain substantial original, unpublished material.
All  submissions  must  be written in English. Technical papers and application
papers must not exceed 15 pages in the Springer LNCS format

                   (see http://www.springeronline.com/lncs/)

The limit for posters is 5 pages in the same format.

The  primary  means  of  submission  will  be electronic, through the Easychair
submission system. The submission page is available at

               http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ICLP08


PUBLICATION
-----------
The  proceedings  of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag in the
LNCS  series.  All  accepted  papers  and  posters  will  be  included  in  the
proceedings.

WORKSHOPS
---------
The  ICLP'08  program will include several workshops. They are perhaps the best
place  for  the  presentation  of  preliminary  work, novel ideas, and new open
problems  to  a more focused and specialized audience. Workshops also provide a
venue  for  presenting  specialised  topics  and  opportunities  for  intensive
discussions   and   project   collaboration  in  any  areas  related  to  logic
programming, including cross-disciplinary areas.

DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM
-------------------
The  Doctoral  Consortium  (DC)  on  Logic  Programming  is  the  4th  Doctoral
consortium  to  provide  doctoral  students with the opportunity to present and
discuss  their  research directions, and to obtain feedback from both peers and
word-renown  experts  in the field. The DC will also offer invited speakers and
panel discussions. Accepted participants will receive partial financial support
to  attend  the  event and the main conference. The best paper and presentation
from  the DC will be given the opportunity to present in special session of the
main ICLP conference.

CELEBRATING 20th YEARS OF STABLE MODEL SEMANTICS
------------------------------------------------
The year 2008 marks the 20th anniversary of the publication that introduced the
stable  model semantics for logic programs with negation. The paper titled "The
stable  semantics for logic programs" by Michael Gelfond and Vladimir Lifschitz
was  presented  at  ICLP-1988.  It  was  a  momentous event that gave rise to a
vibrant  subfield of logic programming known now as the answer-set programming.
Its  distinguishing  aspects  are  close connections to the fields of knowledge
representation,   satisfiability   and  constraint  satisfaction,  ever  faster
computational tools, and a growing list of successful applications.

To  celebrate  the  stable-model  semantics, there will be a special session at
ICLP  2008  dedicated to answer-set programming. The session will feature talks
by  Michael  Gelfond  and  Vladimir  Lifschitz.  as  well  as  by  other  major
contributions   to   the   field,   presenting  personal  perspectives  on  the
stable-model  semantics,  its  impact  and  its  future.  There will be a panel
discussion,  and  regular  accepted  ICLP  papers  falling  into the answer-set
programming area will complete the program.


CONFERENCE VENUE
----------------
The conference will be held in the city of Udine, the capital of the historical
region  of  Friuli, Italy. Located between the Adriatic sea and the Alps, close
to  Venice,  Austria  and Slovenia, Udine is a city of Roman origins, funded by
Emperor  Otto  in  983.  Rich of historical sites, Udine is also famous for its
commercial  and  shopping  opportunities  and its outstanding wine and culinary
traditions.

SUPPORT SPONSORING AND AWARDS
-----------------------------
The conference is sponsored by the Association for Logic Programming (ALP). The
ALP  has  funds  to  assist  financially disadvantaged participants. The ALP is
planning  to sponsor two awards for ICLP 2008: for the best technical paper and
for the best student paper.

Hi all,

While we can make all monoidal categories strict, I was wondering how
strict we can make monoidal functors. More precisely, given a strong
monoidal functor F:(C,@,I) --> (D,*,1) between strict monoidal
categories, it has the data

m_xy: F(x)*F(y) ---> F(x@y)   (natural)

u:1 ---> F(I).

Is F naturally isomorphic to a strong monoidal functor such that u is
the identity?

In Baez-Lauda HDA 5 it is an exercise to the reader in the proof of
Proposition 8.3.6 to do this for weak monoidal categories.

Cheers,

David

Part I



Abstract: A hyperalgebra is an algebra of type (0, 0, ..., 2, 3, 4, ...)
satisfying three axioms.

Finitary hyperalgebras form a coreflective full subcategory of the variety
of hyperalgebras, which

is equivalent to the opposite of the category of varieties.

Thus any subvariety of the variety of hyperalgebras may be viewed as a
hypervariety,

i.e. a variety of varieties in the sense of W. D. Neumann.



Definition. A hyperalgebra is a nonempty set A together with a sequence

X = {x_1, x_2, ...} of elements of A and a sequence S = {s_1, s_2, ...}

of operations s_n: A^{n+1} -> A, which satisfies the following axioms for M,
M_1, ..., M_m,

N_1, ..., N_n in A:



Write M[M_1, ..., M_n] for s_n(M, M_1, ..., M_n).



A1. x_n[M_1, ..., M_m] = M_n if n < m + 1.



A2. (M[M_1, ..., M_m])[N_1, ..., N_n] = M[M_1[N_1, ..., N_n], ..., M_m[N_1,
..., N_n]].



A3. M[M_1, ..., M_m] = M[M_1, ..., M_m, M_m].



A hyperalgebra A is finitary if for any M in A there is n > 0 such that M =
M[x_1, ..., x_n].



Let A be a hyperalgebra. A model of A is a set D together with a sequence U
= {u_1, u_2,...}

of operations u_n: A x D^n -> D, which satisfying the following axioms for
M, M_1, ..., M_m in A and

a_1, ..., a_n in D:



Write M[a_1, ..., a_n] for u_n(M, a_1, ..., a_n).



B1. x_n[a_1, ..., a_m] = a_n if n < m + 1.




B2. (M[M_1, ..., M_m])[a_1, ..., a_n] = M[M_1[a_1, ..., a_n], ..., M_m[a_1,
..., a_n]].



B3. M[a_1, ..., a_n] = M[a_1, ..., a_n, a_n].



Define homomorphisms of models in an obvious way. Denote by Mod(A) the
category of models of A.



Theorem. 1. If V is a variety and T(V) is the free algebra of V over X, then
T(V) is naturally a finitary hyperalgebra, and V is equivalent to Mod(T(V))
as concrete categories over Set .



2. If A is a hyperalgebra then the class Mod(A) forms a variety. If A is a
finitary hyperalgebra then it is

isomorphic to T(Mod(A)).



3. The correspondences A -> Mod(A) and V -> T(V) establish an equivalence
between the category

of finitary hyperalgebras and the opposite of the category of varieties.

In March I asked a question on adjoints, to which I have received no
correct response.  Rather than ask it again, I will pose what seems to be
a simpler and maybe more manageable question.  Suppose C is a complete
category and E is an object.  Form the full subcategory of C whose objects
are equalizers of two arrows between powers of E.  Is that category closed
in C under equalizers?  (Not, to be clear, the somewhat different question
whether it is internally complete.)

In that form, it seems almost impossible to believe that it is, but it is
surprisingly hard to find an example.  When E is injective, the result is
relatively easy, but when I look at examples, it has turned out to be true
for other reasons.  Probably there is someone out there who already knows
an example.

Consider the dual finitary question: In universal algebra in order to show
that finitely presented objects  are closed under coequalizers it is
essential  that a amorphism of finitely presented objects lift to a
morphism  between the free. Is this the only way to prove it ? :

" but when I look at examples, it has turned out to be true
 for other reasons."

No.  For example, in the category of topological abelian groups, Z is far
from injective.  Nonetheless, if you say that a group is Z-compact when it
is an equalizer of two maps between powers of Z, then an equalizer of two
maps between Z-compact abelian groups is again Z-compact.  The proof is
not direct.  As it happens, I am talking on this in our seminar tomorrow.

Even though the reals are not injective in hausdorff spaces, a space is
realcompact iff it is a closed subspace of a power of R, which turns out
to be equivalent to being an equalizer of two maps between powers of R
(that is a cokernel pair of such a closed inclusion has enough real-valued
functions to separate points) and it is clear that a closed subspace of a
realcompact space is again realcompact.  Same thing for N-compact.  In
fact, for every example I have looked at sufficiently closely.

Dear Michael,

Let C be the category of commutative rings (with 1), let t be the unique
positive real number with tttt = 2 (if I knew TeX better, I would probably
write t^4 = 2), and E be the smallest subfield in the field of real numbers
that contains t. Then:

(a) Every power of E has exactly one element x such that xx = 2 and there
exists y with x = yy. Let us call this x the positive square root of 2.

(b) Every morphism between powers of E preserves the positive square root of
2.

(c) Therefore every equalizer of two arrows between powers of E has an
element x with xx = 2 (note that I am not saying anything about the
existence of y, since y above is not determined uniquely!).

(d) Therefore the field Q of rational numbers cannot be presented as an
equalizer of two arrows between powers of E.

(e) On the other hand Q can be presented as an equalizer of two arrows
between two objects in C that are equalizers of two arrows between powers of
E. Indeed: the equalizer of the identity morphism of E and the unique
non-identity morphism of E is the subfield D in E generated by tt (which is
just the square root of 2); and the equalizer of the identity morphism of D
and the unique non-identity morphism of D is Q.

(f) This also gives negative answer to the question about "internally
complete", since no arrow of our subcategory composed with the two morphisms
D ---> D above will give the same result.

This story is of course based on the fact that there are Galois field
extensions L/K and M/L, for which M/K is not a Galois extension.

Best regards, George

I have checked this carefully and it works.  To summarize, let F =
Q[2^{1/2}] and E = Q[2^{1/4}].  Then any power of E contains a square
whose square is a square root of 2 and any ring homomorphism between
powers of E preserves it.  (Incidentally, although it may help your
intuition to take the positive fourth of 2, the various fourth roots of 2
are indistinguishable algebraically.)  Thus any ring in EqP(E) contains a
square root of 2 (although not necessarily a fourth root).  Now F is the
equalizer of the two distinct maps E to E, while Q is the equalizer of the
two distinct maps F to F.

This now gives a counter-example for my original question.  Let C be the
category of commutative rings, F = Hom(-,E) : C ---> Set\op and U = E^{-}:
Set\op ---> C are adjoint.  If T is the resultant triple, then F ---> E
===> E is an equalizer between two values of U, while not being the
canonical equalizer.  TF = E x E and T^2F = E x E x E x E.  I haven't done
the computation, but I believe the equalizer of TF ===> T^2 is F x F.

Thanks George,

Michael

Dear Michael,

I do not remember your original question, but here is an answer to this.
Let C be Cat^op and E be the arrow category 2.

It's easier to work in Cat itself. Then we are interested in the full
subcategory consisting of all categories X which admit a presentation=20

I.2 --> J.2 --> X
    --> =20

where I and J are sets, and "." is cotensor: e.g. J.2 denotes the=20
coproduct of J copies of 2.

But a category admits such a presentation if and only if it is free on=20
a graph, and the free categories are of course not closed under
coequalizers.

Steve.

Dear Michael,

Sorry to say, I have no time now - so, just briefly:

I know that "positive" is just an illusion and I only used it to make things
seem more obvious. Moreover, "fields" is also an illusion, since all the
rings involved are (quasi-) separable Q-algebras - and in fact one should
put things inside the dual category of G-sets, where, say, G is a finite
group that has a subgroup whose normalizer is a normal subgroup in G
different from G itself. This would imply that the phenomenon you were
looking for can even be found in a category dual to a Boolean topos.

However I still have to study what you say in the second paragraph of your
message...

Thank you for an interesting question-

George

Michael Barr asked,

By which I understand that C has all finite limits and powers of E,
although I usually write Sigma instead of E.

This full subcategory consists of the objects that I call "sober".

> Is that category closed in C under equalizers?

Yes.

Write  $X  for the exponential  E^X.
Then $ is a self-adjoint contravariant endofunctor of the category C,
and the covariant functor $$ is part of a monad.

For any object X there is a diagram with equal composites
                       eta $$ X
         eta X        --------->
     X  ------>  $$ X             $$$$ X
                      --------->
                       $$ eta X
and X is by definition "sober" if this is an equaliser.
Any sober object in this sense belongs to Mike's subcategory.

Any  $Y  is sober, because  eta $Y  is split by  $ eta Y
(see the chapter on Beck's triplability theorem in "Toposes,
Triples and Theories", for example, for details).

Now if  Y and Z are sober and  X >--->  Y ====>  Z  is an equaliser,
we can form a  3x3  square of objects,  whose rows and columns (with
one a priori exception)  are equalisers,   and then  check that the
last is an equaliser too,  ie X is sober.

In other words,  Mike's subcategory is closed under equalisers and
consists of the sober objects.     []

I don't remember the details of the papers in question, but
investigations of this kind go back to Lambek & Rattray c1975.

Then in Synthetic Domain Theory (SDT) c1990,  Rosolini, Phoa, Hyland
and I looked at various properties that select "predomains" as special
objects of a topos.   One of these was Hyland's notion of "repleteness",
which Rosolini, Fiore and Makkai showed to be slightly weaker than
sobriety,  when you chararacterise these things in particular
concrete categories.  Conceptually, though, they amount to the same
thing.  Streicher also looked looked at sobriety in a concrete setting.

I would say that it is a mistake to see sobriety as a property of
objects in a category that has been given in advance.  It should
really be seen as a property of the category:  that the functor $
reflects invertibility.   Alternatively, we may see it is an axiom
in a richer logic,  where it has the concrete interpretation that
- N is sober iff it admits definition by description and
- R is sober iff it is Dedekind complete.
See S 14 of "The Dedekind Reals in ASD"  by Bauer and me for details
www.PaulTaylor.EU/ASD/dedras

The idea of Abstract Stone Duality came out of my earlier involvement
in SDT,  and was also motivated by Pare's theorem that $ (now the
contravariant powerset functor) is monadic in any elementary topos.
Mathematically, the most important consequence of this hypothesis
is  the Heine--Borel theorem,  that [0,1] subset R is compact in the
"finite open subcover" sense.    I gave a summary of this in my
posting to "categories" on 18 August 2007.

The monadic hypothesis led to an account of (computably based)
locally compact spaces,  from which it is very difficult to escape.

Stepping back from monadicity, and almost going back to Mike Barr's
question,  the Heine--Borel theorem is a consequence of having "the
right" relationship between  $  (powers of the Sierpinski space) and
equalisers.   Within the category of "topological spaces"  as found
in the textbooks,  or that of locales,  this relationship is called
either the "subspace topology" or "injectivity of Sierpinski".

However, I have a counterexample (which I am not willing to spell
out in ASCII) to show that this cannot extend verbatim to cartesian
closed categories of spaces.    I shall present this,  the weaker
property that I think should generalise it,  my syntactic proof
that this property is consistent (I have no concrete model)  and
some of its applications,  at CT08 in Calais next month (assuming,
of course, that the programme committee accepts my submission).

I am sure that you will have gathered that I interpreted the "powers"
in Mike Barr's question in a different way from the others that replied,
and indeed from the way in which he intended it.  His "powers" were
set-indexed products of the object with itself, whilst mine were
in the sense of a cartesian closed category.

Nevertheless, it is interesting that we have two conflicting answers.
Those who are more familiar with the algebraic examples that Eduardo
Dubuc,  George Janelidze and Stev Lack have discussed  may like to
consider where the differences lie, notwithstanding what I am about
to say..

Unfortunately, as Mike pointed out to me privately, there was first
carelessness, and then an actual error, in what I wrote:
> Now if  Y and Z are sober and  X >--->  Y ====>  Z  is an equaliser,
> we can form a  3x3  square of objects,  whose rows and columns (with
> one a priori exception)  are equalisers,   and then  check that the

The carelessness was that I only intended the top row and two
columns to be equalisers, not five rows/columns.   The error
was that  $$X--->$$Y apparently needs to be mono.   The proof,
in all its gory ASCII detail, follows.

I apologise for the error.  I was reciting results from ASD without
checking that all of the relevant hypotheses were present.

The correct ASD results are that this is true when

either    i:X>-->Y  is a Sigma-split inclusion,
           so  $i  is split epi and $$i is split mono

or        we have the more general structure that I intend
           to talk about in Calais.

Mike also asked me for a reference for the relationship between
my abstract notion of sobriety and the traditional one that
every irreducible closed subset is the closure of a unique point.

This is discussed (as you might have guessed) in
    "Sober Spaces and Continuations"   TAC 2002
    www.PaulTaylor.EU/ASD

However, the relationship is conceptual and not extensional.  The
point is that a sober "space" is one whose points agree with the
"primes" of the corresponding algebra,  under some Stone-type duality.
The paper makes some attempt to set up an extensional equivalence,
but such a thing is really not meaningful.

                                 ------------->

Suppose that the top row and Y and Z columns are equalisers,
i;f = h = i;g   and  Gamma-->$$X  has equal composites to $$$$ X,
and therefore continuing to $$$$ Y.   (We'll consider $$$$ Z later.)

Since eta$$ and $$eta are natural (wrt i),  the two squares from
$$X to $$$$Y commute.   Therefore  Gamma-->$$X-->$$Y  has equal
composites  as far as  $$$$Y.   In other words,  it tests the
equaliser  Y>-->$$Y===>$$$$Y,   so there is a unique fill-in
(dotted)  Gamma-->Y  that makes a commutative kite  at  $$Y.

Now, ignore the fact that we have parallel maps  f  and  g  etc,
and just consider their composite h:Z-->Z with i.   By exactly
the same argument as we have just used for  Y  and  i,   the
map  Gamma-->$$X-->$$Z  has equal composites at $$$$Z,  ie it
tests Y as the equaliser,  and has a uniqe fill-in  Gamma-->Z
that makes a commutative kite at $$Z.

Now, there are two other candidates for the fill-in  Gamma-->Z,
namely the two composites  Gamma--->Y===>Z,  so these are all
equal.   This tests the equaliser   X>--->Y====Z,  so there is
a unique fill-in  Gamma-->X.

Now here was my error:  why should the composite  Gamma-->X-->$$X
be equal the original map?   Well, it is, so long as  $$X-->$$Y
is mono.

                             Workshop   DOMAINS IX

         http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/events/domains9/

         University of Sussex, Brighton, 22-24 September 2008

------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION

    The Workshop on Domains is aimed at computer scientists and
     mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
     foundations of computation. The workshop will focus on
     domains, their applications and related topics.  Previous
meetings were
     held in Darmstadt (94,99,04), Braunschweig (96), Munich (97),
     Siegen (98), Birmingham (02) and Novosibirsk (07).

FORMAT

    The emphasis is on the exchange of ideas between participants
similar
     in style to Dagstuhl seminars.  In particular, talks on subjects
     presented at other conferences and workshops are acceptable.

INVITED SPEAKERS (confirmed)

    Andrew Pitts 			Cambridge University
    John Longley			University of Edinburgh
    Martin Hyland		        Cambridge University
    Jean Goubault-Larrecq   LSV/ENS Cachan & CNRS

   More speakers to be announced nearer to the time.

SCOPE

     Domain theory has had applications to programming language
     semantics and logics (lambda-calculus, PCF, LCF), recursion theory
     (Kleene-Kreisel countable functionals), general topology
     (injective spaces, function spaces, locally compact spaces, Stone
     duality), topological algebra (compact Hausdorff semilattices) and
     analysis (measure, integration, dynamical systems). Moreover,
     these applications are related - for example, Stone duality gives
     rise to a logic of observable properties of computational
     processes.

     As such, domain theory is highly interdisciplinary. Topics of
     interaction with domain theory for this workshop include, but are
     not limited to:

       program semantics
       program logics
       probabilistic computation
       exact computation over the real numbers
       lambda calculus
       games
       models of sequential computation
       constructive mathematics
       recursion theory
       realizability
       real analysis and computability
       topology, metric spaces and domains
       locale theory
       category theory
       topos theory
       type theory


SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS

     _*One-page* abstracts should be submitted now to

                   domains9@sussex.ac.uk

     Shortly after an abstract is submitted (usually one or two weeks),
     the authors will be notified by the programme committee. The
     criterion for acceptance is relevance to the meeting. In
     particular, talks on subjects presented at other conferences and
     workshops are acceptable.

     *** Abstracts will be dealt with on a first-come/first-served
basis! ***
     *** So please submit soon to avoid disappointment.     ***

Hi everyone,

I was surprised to receive several applications for the post doc
position at University of Savoy. Since at most one candidate will be
hired, I thought I might draw attention to another postdoc offer in
Marseille

http://choco.pps.jussieu.fr/postdoc

which is focused on concurrency theory.

Sorry for two non mathematical messages,

  Tom

In our (John Kennison, Bob Raphael, and I) work, the following condition
has arisen.  Has anyone seen or named it?  Say that an object E of a
category is a ???? if it is a cogenerator and if whenever f: A ---> B is
not an epimorphism and g: B ---> C is a regular monomorphism, then there
are two maps h,k: C ---> E s.t. hg is unequal to kg, while hgf = kgf.

This is related to the questions Paul Taylor and I have raised recently.

Theorem.  If E satisfies ????, then whenever A has an extremal
monomorphism into a power of E, then A ---> TA ===> T^2A is an equalizer
where T is the triple from the adjoint pair Hom(-,E) and E^{(-)}.

What's interesting is that while it is obvious that any injective
cogenerator satisfies ????, it is also the case that any cogenerator that
contains an injective cogenerator also satisfies ????.  Thus, in
completely regular spaces, the interval is a cogenerator and both it and
the real line (and many, many other spaces) also satisfy ????.

The subject line of my previous message suggested that FMCS is next
weekend - in fact it is in two weeks. Sorry for the confusion!

This says that there is a map from 1 to 0.  Surely that is a mistake?

Sorry for the poor quality.  I kept the file small for sake
of anyone using an old modem.

How about someone suggesting a name for this category.
Seems worth posting as a SVG or PostScript for benefit
of other novices such as me.

Thanks,             ... Peter E.

A couple of months ago, there was a discussion in this forum about
categorical formulations of the Axiom-Scheme of Replacement.

 From this, no fewer than four approaches emerged, as follows:

(1) Steve Awodey considered Algebraic Set Theory
(2) Colin McLarty considered an Elementary Theory of the
     Category of Sets
(3) Thomas Streicher considered Universes
(4) I (Paul Taylor) considered iterations of a functor
     indexed by a well founded coalgebra.

(I was going to write a one-paragraph summary of each of these,
but decided that the risk of error was too great.)

Following the public discussion, the four of us, together with
Mike Shulman, who had raised the question in the first place,
continued it in private for a while.   What I wanted to achieve
from this was some agreement on a metalanguage for the classes
(such as a Heyting pretopos) and a statement of each formulation
within this metalanguage.  Then someone (else) could compare the
definitions, and ask to what extent they are equivalent.  (I don't
want to re-open the substantive discussion at the moment,  but
I should point out that the objective of my formulation was to
avoid the need for such a metalanguage, although this is needed
to compare my view with the others.)

We didn't manage to do this, but the five of us adjourned our
discussion, with an agreement to re-open it later.  One possibility
is the Category Theory meeting in Calais next month,  and I suggested
to the Programme Committee that they might set aside a room for a
parallel session devoted to this topic.   In their response,
they seem to have interpreted the proposal in a rather more formal
way than we had intended.  Also, it turns out that, of the five,
only Steve and I will be present.

So, to get to the point, Steve and I invite anyone who would like
to take part in a discussion (of whatever degree of formality) about
Replacement during the course of the conference to contact us
privately,  so that we can make arrangements with the programme
committee.

The workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming is
devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of
remarkable power and abstraction. Monadic programming in Haskell is
the paradigmatic example, but there are many more mathematical
insights manifest in programs and in programming language design:
Freyd-categories in reactive programming, symbolic differentiation
yielding context structures, and comonadic presentations of dataflow,
to name but three. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek
to reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.

Let me congratulate Andree for having done this.  My attitude is that the
more mathematics is freely available online, the more the profession will
benefit.  That is why all my own papers that I can find online (many the
result of McGill's subscription and not generally available) can be found
at ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr/pdffiles.  I am, of course, violating
copyrights in doing so, so sue me.  I will add my Cahiers papers to the
collection as soon as I have time.

(a reminder for many, an announcement for others, and perhaps something v=
erging
on spam for some, with apologies)


The workshop

Deep Inference, its Algebra, Geometry and Syntax

Will be held in Nancy, France on June 18 2008.

As the title implies the main theme of the workshop is deep
inference, but talks on related subjects like the the improvement and
abstract theory of proof formalisms are most welcome.

The workshop will be held at the Loria computer science lab on
Wednesday June 18 2008, starting at 10:30, so as to ensure an easy
commute from Paris (there is a Paris-Nancy TGV that leaves Gare de
l'Est at 8:12 and the last return train leaves Nancy at 20:15).

The webpage

http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/deepinf.html

contains a few more details, including suggestions for accomodation.
Please contact me if you intend to attend and/or give a talk.

   Engineering,  Natural  Language  Processing,  Web  and Semantic Web, Agents,
   Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics


The three broad categories for submissions are:
   (1) Technical papers,  providing  novel research  contributions,  innovative
       perspectives  on the field,  and/or novel integrations  across different
       areas;
   (2) Application  papers,  describing  innovative uses  of  logic programming
       technology in real-world application domains;
   (3) Posters, ideal for presenting and discussing current work, not yet ready
       for publication, for PhD thesis summaries and research project overviews.


A  separate  session  dedicated  to  the celebration of the 20th anniversary of
stable model semantics will also be part of the program.


Accepted  papers and posters will be allocated time for presentation during the
conference.  At  least  one  author  of each accepted submission is expected to
register and participate in the event.


In  addition  to papers and posters, the technical program will include invited
talks,  advanced  tutorials,  specialized  sessions,  workshops, and a Doctoral
Student  Consortium.  Details,  as  they  become  available  will be posted at:


                          http://iclp08.dimi.uniud.it


PAPERS AND POSTERS
------------------
Papers and posters must describe original, previously unpublished research, and
must  not  be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere. Emphasis will
be  placed  on  the  novelty  and innovative nature of the results (even if not
completely polished and refined).
All  submissions  will  be peer-reviewed by an international panel. Submissions
MUST contain substantial original, unpublished material.
All  submissions  must  be written in English. Technical papers and application
papers must not exceed 15 pages in the Springer LNCS format


                   (see http://www.springeronline.com/lncs/)


The limit for posters is 5 pages in the same format.


The  primary  means  of  submission  will  be electronic, through the Easychair
submission system. The submission page is available at


               http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ICLP08


APPLICATION PAPERS
------------------

Within  the  scope  of  the  general  call  for  papers  for  the upcoming 24th
International  Conference  on  Logic  Programming,  we  would  like to draw the
attention  of  researchers  and  practitioners  on  the  opportunity  to submit
manuscripts to the Application Track of the conference.

Application  papers,  are  expected  to  describing  complex  and/or real-world
applications  that  rely in an essential manner on the use of logic programming
technology.  Description  of  innovative  applications  as  well as engineering
solutions leveraging logic programming technology are solicited.

Papers  must describe original, previously unpublished results, and must not be
simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.

Submissions  MUST  contain  substantial  original,  unpublished  material.  All
submissions must be written in English. Application papers should be structured
to emphasize:

       * the application domain, in terms understandable by a layman
       * the specific problem addressed within the application domain,
         stressing importance and complexity
       * a clear discussion of the unique need for logic programming technology
         to address the problem
       * a clear description of the application developed and its evaluation.


PUBLICATION
-----------
The  proceedings  of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag in the
LNCS  series.  All  accepted  papers  and  posters  will  be  included  in  the
proceedings.


WORKSHOPS
---------
The  ICLP'08  program will include several workshops. They are perhaps the best
place  for  the  presentation  of  preliminary  work, novel ideas, and new open
problems  to  a more focused and specialized audience. Workshops also provide a
venue  for  presenting  specialised  topics  and  opportunities  for  intensive
discussions   and   project   collaboration  in  any  areas  related  to  logic
programming, including cross-disciplinary areas.


DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM
-------------------
The  Doctoral  Consortium  (DC)  on  Logic  Programming  is  the  4th  Doctoral
consortium  to  provide  doctoral  students with the opportunity to present and
discuss  their  research directions, and to obtain feedback from both peers and
word-renown  experts  in the field. The DC will also offer invited speakers and
panel discussions. Accepted participants will receive partial financial support
to  attend  the  event and the main conference. The best paper and presentation
from  the DC will be given the opportunity to present in special session of the
main ICLP conference.


CELEBRATING 20th YEARS OF STABLE MODEL SEMANTICS
------------------------------------------------
The year 2008 marks the 20th anniversary of the publication that introduced the
stable  model semantics for logic programs with negation. The paper titled "The
stable  semantics for logic programs" by Michael Gelfond and Vladimir Lifschitz
was  presented  at  ICLP-1988.  It  was  a  momentous event that gave rise to a
vibrant  subfield of logic programming known now as the answer-set programming.
Its  distinguishing  aspects  are  close connections to the fields of knowledge
representation,   satisfiability   and  constraint  satisfaction,  ever  faster
computational tools, and a growing list of successful applications.


To  celebrate  the  stable-model  semantics, there will be a special session at
ICLP  2008  dedicated to answer-set programming. The session will feature talks
by  Michael  Gelfond  and  Vladimir  Lifschitz.  as  well  as  by  other  major
contributions   to   the   field,   presenting  personal  perspectives  on  the
stable-model  semantics,  its  impact  and  its  future.  There will be a panel
discussion,  and  regular  accepted  ICLP  papers  falling  into the answer-set
programming area will complete the program.



CONFERENCE VENUE
----------------
The conference will be held in the city of Udine, the capital of the historical
region  of  Friuli, Italy. Located between the Adriatic sea and the Alps, close
to  Venice,  Austria  and Slovenia, Udine is a city of Roman origins, funded by
Emperor  Otto  in  983.  Rich of historical sites, Udine is also famous for its
commercial  and  shopping  opportunities  and its outstanding wine and culinary
traditions.


SUPPORT SPONSORING AND AWARDS
-----------------------------
The conference is sponsored by the Association for Logic Programming (ALP). The
ALP  has  funds  to  assist  financially disadvantaged participants. The ALP is
planning  to sponsor two awards for ICLP 2008: for the best technical paper and
for the best student paper.

Dear Colleagues,


The Department of Computer Science in the University of Leicester, UK,
is offering two new Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) positions. The
deadline for applications is June 16th. The application forms and
further details are here:

 http://www.le.ac.uk/personnel/supportjobs/s3759a.html

A GTA is a funded PhD student who is expected to undertake teaching
duties during the ten week teaching periods of each of our two annual
semesters (roughly, subsets of October to December and January to
March).

These positions should be of special interest to readers of the
Categories and Types mailing lists, with both of these research areas
being very active within the Department.



Roy Crole.

Hello. In a category with pullbacks, say that a binary relation
  X <- R -> Y
is "z-closed" if it satisfies the following axiom (interpreted as
usual):

  If x R y and x' R y and x' R y' then x R y'.

(The "z" in "z-closed" refers to the pattern of variables in the
premise.)

Z-closedness seems to be a sensible generalization of "equivalence"
to relations between two different objects. (e.g. In computer
science, it is common to relate the state spaces of two different
systems.) Note that an endorelation is an equivalence relation if and
only if it is z-closed and reflexive. Also note that, in an abelian
category, every relation is z-closed.

The [z-closed v. equivalence] connection seems to extend to
[pullbacks v. kernel pairs]. Every span that arises from a pullback
is a z-closed relation. Say that a category is "z-effective" if every
z-closed relation arises as a pullback.

- every abelian category is straightforwardly z-effective;
- in a topos, every z-closed relation arises as a pullback span.
Indeed, an extensive regular category has effective equivalence
relations if and only if it is z-effective.

These notions and ideas seem quite elementary, even fundamental, and
I would be surprised if no-one had thought of them before. I borrowed
the terminology "z-closed" from a paper by Erik de Vink and Jan
Rutten (Theoret Comput Sci, 221:271-293, 1999) but I couldn't find
any other references.

Have I missed something? I'd be grateful for any observations or
suggestions.

Sam

PS. I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the helpful
replies (public and private) to my question about W-types, a few
months ago.

Hi Sam,

These "zigzag closed" relations are called "difunctional". Some old referen=
ces are:

[1] J Riguet. Relations binaries, fermetures, correspondances de Galois (19=
48)
[2] J Riguet. Quelques proprieties des relations difonctionelles (1950)
[3] Katuzi Ono. On some properties of binary relations (1957).

and once one knows what to search for, it turns out they're well-known.

An interesting characterization (which is how we(*) discovered them) is tha=
t in sets, they're the TT-closed relations, where if x,x'\in A, x(R^TT)x' i=
f
 forall k k' : A->2, (forall y y', yRy' -> k y =3D k y') -> k x =3D k x'
([4] M Abadi. TT-closed relations and admissibility (2000)
considers the situation in cpos).

In Genoa, in the late 60's and after, our group was studying
categories of relations.

I was interested in relations on abelian categories, for homological
algebra, while Gabriele Darbo, Franco Parodi and others were more
interested - after the general construction - in relations on sets,
and even more in "corelations on sets" (relations on Set^op), called
"transductors". (It is the dual construction, based on equivalence
classes of cospans of sets, i.e. quotients of the sum of domain and
codomain; used to simulate electric connections between two sets of
terminals [see how they compose], and as a formal basis for a general
"theory of devices".)

At that time, a category with involution  u |--> u*  (typically, a
category of relations in some sense) was called "von Neumann regular"
if the condition  u.u*.u = u  holds for every arrow (plainly related
to von Neumann regularity of semigroups and rings).

The category of relations of sets is not vN-regular, the simplest
counterexample being likely the Z-shaped relation which transgresses
your condition:

R: {x, y} --> {x', y'}
x R y,    x' R y,     x' R y'

This relation was precisely called "Z" in the paper

  [Pa] F. Parodi, Simmetrizzazioni di una categoria II, Sem. Mat.
Univ. Padova, 44 (1970), 223-262.

RSMUP_1970__44__223_0/RSMUP_1970__44__223_0.pdf

On the other hand, as you say, category of relations on abelian
categories are von Neumann regular (which is a crucial fact in
studying subquotients, see Mac Lane's text on Homology).

But, interestingly, the category of CORELATIONS on sets is also von
Neumann regular, see the paper above [Pa].

Dear Sam
I believe that you'll find `Frobenius objects in cartesian bicategories'
by Bob Walters and me, #3 in volume 20 of TAC, interesting. It is
precisely this closing of Z-configurations to give an X-configuration
that translates the Frobenius condition in the cartesian bicategory of
profunctors. It has been known for a long time, but I think unpublished
until our paper appeared, that the Frobenius objects in profunctors are
groupoids. The paper by Bob W and me shows that this admits considerable
generalization.
Best regards
Richard Wood

Sam Staton asks about relations with the property:

     If x R y and x' R y and x' R y' then x R y'.

Given an equational theory all relations in its category of models
satisfy this property iff there's a Mal'cev operator,(a favorite
topic among "universal algebraists").

Years ago I used the phrase Mal'cev property (MP) to mean that all
relations in an allegory satisfy the condition. Some easy lemmas:

  MP implies all reflexive relations are symmetric (RIS).
  RIS implies equivalence relations commute (ERC).
  MP implies all reflexive relations are transitive (RIT).
  RIT implies ERC.
  ERC implies that the smallest equivalence relation containing a
given pair of equivalence relations is their composition and that
easily implies that the lattice of equivalence relations on any
object is a modular lattice.

ERC does not imply MP (there are simple examples for RIS not implying
RIT and RIT not implying RIS). But in an allegory in which every
relation is spanned by a pair of maps (in particular, in the calculus
of relations arising from any regular category) it's easy to see that
ERC does implies MP.

For the record: txyz is defined to be a Mal'cev operator if it
satisfies the two equations

    txxz = z       txzz = x.

In any theory that includes the theory of groups xy^{-1}z is such. For
Heyting algebras take txyz = ((x -> y) -> z) ^ ((z -> y) -> z). That
generalizes to a one-object division allegory: tPQR =
(R/(1 ^ (R\Q))) ^ (R/(1 ^ (P\Q))).

The provably simplest Mal'cev theory has one binary operation x*y and
one equation x*(y*x) = y (e.g. in the presence of a group structure
x*y = x^{-1}y^{-1}). Take txyz = (x*x)*(z*(x*y)). There are another 23
Mal'cev terms of the same size.

If one weakens the theory of groups to the theory of quasigroups: that
is, three binary relations and four equations

   (x/y)y = x     x(x\y) = y
   (xy)/y = x     x\(xy) = y

then txyz = (x/x)\((x/y)z) is a Mal'cev operator. If we stick to terms
of the same size there are 72 versions. Heavenly. But this one uses
only the first and fourth equation (and, consequently, its mirror
image uses only the second and third equations).

The fact that the existence of a Mal'cev operator implies that
congruence lattices are modular was well known by universal
algebraists.
