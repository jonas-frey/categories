Dear All,

Does the category of k-spaces (i.e. colimits of compact Hausdorff spaces) have
a cogenerator ? Note that these spaces are not necessarily normal because
they are not necessarily Hausdorff. Otherwise [0,1] would have work without
any additional argument.

Thanks in advance. pg.

It is with great sadness that I inform you of the passing of Alex
Heller.

He passed away yesterday after a short illness.

Details to follow.

Sad, sad, sad news indeed.

I have to relay a story Alex told me not so many years ago when
we sat next to each other at a conference dinner.

I asked him about the last illness of Eilenberg, which was long
and difficult.  Alex visited him often, and after a stroke Sammy
could not talk.  On the last time he saw him, as Alex was getting
up to leave, he saw Sammy wanted something.  Then he realized he
wanted a farewell hug.  Anyone who remembers Sammy will recall
he was one of the world's prime skeptics and not much into hugging.
Alex gave him the hug, and just imagining the scene brings tears
to my eyes.

The younger category theorists will have had little knowledge of the great
contributions Alex made in the early days.  Not research in category
theory per se, but an early promoter, supporter, and consumer of category
theory in algebraic topology.  See his paper in the La Jolla volume.  I
believe that he was also one of the organizers of that meeting.

When I arrived in Urbana in the fall of 1964, there was an active seminar
in category theory.  Alex, Jon Beck, Max Kelly, John Gray and I were the
main participants along with graduate students.  Mac Lane's invitation to
the five of us to spend a weekend in Chicago constituted the first
mid-west category meeting.  Then came the La Jolla meeting.
Unfortunately, at the end of that year, Alex went off to CUNY, Jon to
Cornell, Max back to Sydney and John and I were left alone.

Alex was really the third established mathematician (after Eilenberg and
Mac Lane, of course) to embrace category theory in that way.  We mourn his
passing.

Dear Philippe,

You wrote "colimits of compact Hausdorff spaces." In what category? There
is both a Hausdorff and a non-Hausdorff notion for k-spaces. The earlier
is certainly easier to define.

You may wish to look at Chapter 1 of my thesis:

http://at.yorku.ca/p/a/a/o/41.htm

I discuss there both notions, and provide some reference to the
literature, so it might be a good starting point. Spaces where points can
be distinguished by continuous real-valued functions are often referred to
as "functionally Hausdorff."

T. Ishii gives an example of a regular k-space that is not functionally
Hausdorff in his paper "On the Tychonoff functor and $w$-compactness" that
appeared in Topology Appl., 11(2):173--187, 1980. (See Lemma 3.1.) (I can
send you the paper if you are interested.) This, of course, means that
even for Hausdorff k-spaces you cannot use [0,1] as a cogenerator.

Now, as I am writing this, I wonder what you mean by 'cogenerator': An
object such that morphisms into that object can distinguish between
morphisms in the category (i.e., generalized points), or something that
every space in your category admits an __embedding__ to some power of this
object?

The notion of "embedding" already requires some kind of factorization
system, though.

For the earlier, however, {0,1} equipped with the anti-discrete topology
(i.e., only the set itself and the emptyset are open) does what you want.
It is certainly a k-space (albeit non-Hausdorff).


Best wishes,
Gabi

A few neat, if low-res, pictures of Alex (and Saunders) at Coimbra =

and those before and after. While these may well NOT be the images =

Jack meant, they may do until he provides more specific references.

Of course, I, like all who had the privilege of coming to know Alex
and Grace, mourn the passing of this cosmopolitan gentleman, quiet
scholar, and supportive enthusiast for category theory. Would that I
might know how to support Grace in these terrible hours: my heart goes
out to her, as also to his children, both biological and mathematical.

                         - Call for Papers -
                          Fifth Workshop on

       MODEL CHECKING and ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (MoChArt-2008)

               At ECAI-2008 - Patras, Greece, July 2008

                http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~mjw/mochart/


INTRODUCTION

Model checking is the process of determining whether or not a formula
of some logic is satisfied by a model for the logic.  For many logics
of interest -- particularly temporal and modal logics -- model
checking procedures can be efficiently automated. This has led to
widespread interest in the use of model checking as a technique for
verifying properties of systems, and the development of a number of
widely used model checking tools (e.g., Carnegie-Mellon's SMV,
Cadence-SMV, and AT&T's SPIN).

The success of model checking in the computer aided verification
community has led to a growth of interest in the use of model checking
in AI. The MOCHART workshop brings together both researchers in AI
with an interest in model checking, and researchers in model checking
who are interested in AI techniques.

Previous editions of the workshop were held in Riva del Garda, Italy
in 2006 (as satellite workshops of ECAI), San Francisco in 2005 (as
satellite workshop of Concur), Acapulco in 2003 (as satellite workshop
of IJCAI03), and Lyon in 2002 (as satellite workshop of ECAI02). We
are exploring the possibility of publishing a formal proceedings after
the event with Springer-Verlag.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Application of model checking techniques to AI problems.
  - planning as model checking
  - model checking for multi-agent systems
  - diagnosis and model checking
  - model checking versus theorem proving

- Model Checking and AI logics.
  - model checking for combined modal/temporal logics
  - model checking for logics of common sense reasoning

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS
  Workshop on Symmetric calculi and Ludics for the semantic=20
interpretation (http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~quatrini/ESSLLI2008.html)
August 4-8, 2008

organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language and
Information ESSLLI 2008 (http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/), 4-15
August, 2008 in Hamburg, Germany



Workshop Organizers:

Alain Lecomte (SFL - Paris 8),  Alain.Lecomte@upmf-grenoble.fr
Myriam Quatrini (IML Marseille), quatrini@iml.univ-mrs.fr

Workshop Purpose and topics:

  In recent years there have been some important new developments of=20
methods of dealing with semantic and pragmatic phenomena in=20
Linguistics, inspired by developments in Logic and Theoretical Computer=20=

Science. Among these developments, Continuation Theory, Symmetric=20
calculi and Ludics play an important role. Continuation theory dates=20
back from the early seventies (cf. Reynolds, 93) and was at the heart=20
of Programming Languages like Scheme. More recently, a logical account=20=

was given to it, by extending the Curry-Howard homomorphism (Griffin,=20
1990),. This led to several calculi like such as Parigot's=20
lambda-mu-calculus, Curien-Herbelin's lambda-mu-mu-tilde-calculus,=20
Wadler's dual calculus and so on. These calculi are based on the core=20
idea that programs and contexts are dual entities and this is reflected=20=

in the symmetry of the "classical" sequents. These systems were=20
prefigured by the so called Lambek-Grishin calculus (Grishin, 83), a=20
calculus extending the Lambek calculus by taking classical sequents=20
into account. Following Curien-Herbelin (Bernardi and Moortgat, 2007)=20
focuses on the connection between Lambek-Grishin calculus with=20
lambda-mu-tilde-calculus and hence with continuation semantics.
  Classical linear logic (Girard, 87, 95) gives another viewpoint, where=20=

the co-product is realized by an authentic parallelisation connective.=20=

Linguistic applications have been given since around 2000, particularly=20=

by C. Barker (Barker, 2002), K. Chung-chieh Shan (Chung-chieh Shan,=20
2002) and P. de Groote (de Groote, 2001) who exploited the advantages=20
of these systems in the task of giving several readings of an ambiguous=20=

sentence. De Groote (de Groote, 2007) also shows that we gain a new=20
dynamical logic which enables us to elegantly treat phenomena of=20
discourse like anaphora resolution. M. Moortgat and R. Bernardi=20
(Moortgat & Bernardi, 2007) shows how moving to a symmetric categorial=20=

grammar, namely Lambek Grishin calculus, helps accounting for=20
discontinous phenomena that are not captured by the asymmetric Lambek=20
calculus. Independently, linear logic was intensively studied in=20
particular by Girard himself who invented "Ludics" as a new conception=20=

of logic, where the dualism between syntax and semantics is abolished :=20=

the meaning of rules is in the rules themselves. This conception has=20
some similarities with more traditional "Game Semantics" (Lorenz,=20
Lorenzen, Hintikka...) but it is dynamic, in the sense that=20
"strategies" are replaced by interacting processes. Moreover, a new=20
step in abstraction is provided, which consists in stating rule=20
schemata which are only expressed in terms of loci (that we may see as=20=

memory cells).
  The two approaches in this workshop are connected, basically because=20=

of their common root : explorations in the meaning of Logics and in=20
particular reflections on one of the symmetrical systems, namely linear=20=

logic. Linguistic applications of Ludics remain very embryonic, but=20
some authors have already emphasized that it is suitable for giving a=20
framework in which it is possible to study speech acts and dialogue=20
(Livet, 2007, Troncon, 2006). Other authors have pointed out=20
similarities of the Ludics' philosophy with Wittgenstein's views on=20
language games (Pietarinen, 2006). This workshop will provide an=20
opportunity to study these questions. It will accept several kinds of=20
contributions : theoretical works on continuation theory, symmetric=20
calculi and ludics, applied works of these theory concerning linguistic=20=

topics (semantics, pragmatics) and philosophical investigations.


Submission Details:
  Authors are invited to submit an anonymous, extended abstract.=20
Submissions should not exceed 7 pages, including references.=20
Submissions should be in PDF format. Please send your submission=20
electronically using the interface EasyChair. The submissions will be=20

  The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants.=20=

Let F be a functor from a monoidal category M to a category S.

We are given

         beta(p,a) : F(p) --> F(p*a)

natural in p,a in M.

If I tell you that, in addition to naturality, beta is "monoidal", I'm
sure you will immediately guess what I mean by this, viz.

(a) for any p,a,b in M

    beta(p,a) ; beta(p*a,b) = beta(p,a*b) ; F(alpha(p,a,b))

(b) for any p in M

    beta(p,1) = F(rho(p))

Yet I cannot see any reason for giving the name "monoidality" to (a)-(b).

It doesn't appear to be a monoidal natural transformation in the official
sense.  There are no monoidal functors in sight.

Can somebody please justify my usage?

Paul

Hello, here is an answer to Paul's question: The data (F,beta)
defines a (lax?) functor between "monoidal categories with right
units but not left units" [henceforth MR-categories].

Every pointed category can be considered as an MR-category, in fact a
strict one. The tensor product is left projection. The right unit is
the point of the category (although every object of the category
behaves like a right unit for this category.)

In particular, the category S in Paul's email, with point F(1), can
be seen as an MR-category. Of course, every monoidal category,
including M, is an MR-category too.

The data for a lax MR-functor M->S consists of a functor F:M->S, a
morphism F(i)->F(i), which we can take as identity, and a natural
transformation
    F(p)*F(a) --> F(p*a)
which in this case amounts to a map
    beta:F(p) --> F(p*a)

A monoidal functor must satisfy three coherence conditions,
for associativity, left identity and right identity.
For an MR-functor, there are only axioms for associativity and right
identity, and these are exactly the axioms that Paul gave.

Hope that makes sense! All the best, Sam.

Dear Paul,

Let us forget about the monoidal unit and fix (a).

You define a strict semi? monoidal structure on S letting x*y = x.
Then your pair (F, beta) is a lax monoidal functor M --> S. Your
condition (a) is the hexagon of consistency with alpha, which here
reduces to:

F(p)         =          F(p)
   ||                            |
F(p)                    F(p*a)
   |                             |
F(p*(a*b)   -->   F((p*a)*b)

(a single | stands for a downward beta)

Now, to fix also (b), I guess you should add to S a new object which
is a strict identity for the tensor and work out things.
However, if your problem is only about terminology and you do not
want to use the tensor on S in the sequel (eg to compose F with other
monoidal functors), you might not bother about that.

Best regards

Marco

Hi Paul,=20

I think that I have written previously to the list about the=20
possibility of a monoidal functor acting on a mere functor,=20
and what you have is an instance of this notion. =20

Here the monoidal functor is the unique functor M ---> T,
where T is the terminal (monoidal) category.  Your beta is=20
a right action of this guy on F.

In general, a right action of monoidal A --U--> C on mere=20
P --F--> S requires a right action of A on P and a right=20
action of C on S as well as a natural transformation=20
  F(p)*U(a) --beta(p,a)--> F(p*a)=20
satisfying the appropriate associativity and unit axioms.

In your case S is equipped with the trivial right T-action=20
(x*1=3Dx), and M with its canonical right M-action (a*b=3Da*b). =20
The axioms are identical.

Cheers,
Jeff.

Dear Paul,

Here is one possible answer to your question.

One has a notion of action of a monoidal category V on an
arbitrary category X, which generalises that of action by a
monoid on a set; thus we have a functor

(-) * (-): X x V --> X

together with natural isomorphisms x * I ~ x and x * (v * w)
~ (x * v) * w satisfying pentagon and triangle axioms.
Formally, one may define an action of V on X to be a strong
monoidal functor V --> [X, X], where the latter is equipped
with its compositional monoidal structure.

If we are given two categories X and Y equipped with an
action by V, then we have a notion of equivariant morphism
between them; namely a functor F: X --> Y together with
natural morphisms

   m_{x, v} : F(x) * v  --> F(x * v)

obeying axioms like those for a monoidal functor. This is
what one might call a lax equivariant morphism; if the m_{x, v}'s
are all invertible we should rather call it strong,
whilst if they point in the opposite direction then what we
have is an oplax morphism.

The situation you have described is a special case of an lax
equivariant morphism. You have a monoidal category M, and a
functor F : M --> S. Now, M has a canonical action on itself
induced by tensoring on the right (the "right regular
representation"); and it has a trivial action on S given by
s * m = s for all s and m.  Your natural transformation beta
can now be written as

beta(p, a) : F(p) * a --> F(p * a),

and your two axioms are precisely the axioms required for
beta to equip F with the structure of a lax equivariant
morphism.

This whole area of monoidal actions is slightly folklorish
but a useful source is:

George Janelidze and Max Kelly, "A note on actions of a
monoidal category", TAC Vol. 9, No. 4

Also worth mentioning is the work of Paddy McCrudden who has
studied actions by a symmetric monoidal V under the name
"V-actegories".

Hope this is of some help,

Richard

As an addendum to the interesting answers that have been
given so far to Paul's question, it is perhaps worth pointing
out that using an old result of Max Kelly's, the situation
Paul describes can be expressed purely in terms of a strong
monoidal functor.

Given a monoidal category M and functor F : M --> S as in
Paul's message, we define a strict monoidal category {F, F}
as follows. Its objects are triples (G, H, a) fitting into a
diagram of functors and natural transformations

        G
    M -----> M
    |        |
    |   a    |
F  |   =>   | F
    |        |
    v        v
    S -----> S
        H

Its morphisms (G, H, a) --> (G', H', a') are pairs of natural
transformations b : G => G', c : H => H' satisfying the
obvious compatibility condition with a and a'. The tensor
product is given by pasting squares next to each other
horizontally.

There are strict monoidal functors p_1 : {F, F} -> [M, M]
and p_2 : {F, F} -> [S, S] sending (G, H, a) to G and H
respectively; and as in my previous message we have strong
monoidal functors

R : M ---> [M, M]
     m |--> (-) * m

T : M ---> [S, S]
     m |--> id_S

corresponding to the right regular action of M on itself,
and to the trivial action of M on S.

Now to give the natural transformation beta of Paul's
message, satisfying his "monoidality" conditions, is
precisely to give a strong monoidal functor B: M --> {F, F}
rendering the diagram

           _  {F, F}
           .|   |
         .      |
     B .        | (p_1, p_2)
     .          |
   .            v
M --------> [M, M] x [S, S]
    (R, T)

commutative.

I believe this technique originates in the paper

"Coherence theorems for lax algebras and for distributive
laws", G.M. Kelly, LNM 420.

A good place to learn more about it is in Section 2 of

"On property-like structures", G.M. Kelly and S. Lack, TAC Vol. 3, No. 9

Dear categorists,

One of my current research projects has drifted into the realm=20
of uniform locales, which is not exactly my forte.  As I went=20
to re-familiarise myself with the assorted definitions, I found
myself wondering whether one could define a uniform locale as a=20
locale equipped with a designated set of Cauchy filters, instead=20
of uniform covers, or entourages.  Does anyone know whether this=20
idea has already been pursued, either for locales or for spaces? =20

Cheers,
Jeff.

SCOPE AND AIMS
==============

The major goal of the AMAST conferences is to promote research towards
setting software technology on a firm, mathematical basis.  Work towards
this goal is a collaborative, international effort with contributions
from both academia and industry. The envisioned virtues of providing
software technology developed on a mathematical basis include
(a) correctness, which can be proved mathematically,
(b) safety, so that developed software can be used in the implementation
of critical systems,
(c) portability, i.e., independence from computing platforms and
language generations, and
(d) evolutionary change, i.e., the software is self-adaptable and
evolves with the
problem domain.

The previous conferences were held in: Iowa City, Iowa, USA (1989,
1991 and 2000); Twente, The Netherlands (1993); Montreal, Canada
(1995); Munich, Germany (1996); Sydney, Australia (1997); Manaus,
Amazonia, Brazil (1998); Reunion Island, France (2002); Stirling, UK
(2004, colocated with MPC' 04); Kuressaare, Estonia (2006, colocated
with MPC '06).

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY:
- systems software technology
- application software technology
- concurrent and reactive systems
- formal methods in industrial software development
- formal techniques for software requirements, design
- evolutionary software/adaptive systems

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY:
- logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms
- constraint programming and concurrency
- program verification and transformation
- programming calculi
- specification languages and tools
- formal specification and development case studies

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS:
- logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra
- algebraic foundations for languages and systems, coinduction
- theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning
- logics of programs
- algebra and coalgebra

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers):
- software development environments
- support for correct software development
- system support for reuse
- tools for prototyping

Hi Jeff,

I don't know about locales, but I worked on issues surrounding taking a
uniform space, and forgetting the uniformity but keeping the set of cauchy
filters.  This turns out to be a nontrivial amount of forgetting.  I liked
the result because the resulting category, which I call the category of
completable spaces, can be used as a base category and, for example, if
you have a commutative ring, you can look at the compatible
completabilities on it (making it a completable space with the
discrete completability) and they generalize the valuations on a field.

This can be done, although you get a more general notion:
a _Cauchy_space_ (or locale, but spaces have a bigger literature).
Note that a uniform space is a Cauchy space with extra ~structure~;
there is no way, in a mere Cauchy space,
to compare sizes of neighbourhoods of different points.

For the basic definition, you could do worse than the English Wikipedia:
< http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_space >.
I had some references (monographs) that I liked too,
but I can't find them now; perhaps I can find them tomorrow.

                     Fourth Internation Workshop on
              Intuitionistic Modal Logic and Applications
                               (IMLA'08)

              (http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vdp/IMLA08.html)

                     A LICS'08 affiliated workshop
                Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, June 23, 2008


Constructive modal logics and type theories are of increasing foundational =
and practical relevance in computer science. Applications are in type disci=
plines for programming languages, and meta-logics for reasoning about a var=
iety of computational phenomena.

Theoretical and methodological issues center around the question of how the=
 proof-theoretic strengths of constructive logics can best be combined with=
 the model-theoretic strengths of modal logics. Practical issues center aro=
und the question which modal connectives with associated laws or proof rule=
s capture computational phenomena accurately and at the right level of abst=
raction.

This workshop will bring together designers, implementers, and users to dis=
cuss all aspects of intuitionistic modal logics and type theories.  Topics =
include, but are not limited to:

* applications of intuitionistic necessity and possibility
* monads and strong monads
* constructive belief logics and type theories
* applications of constructive modal logic and modal type theory to formal =
verification, foundations of security, abstract interpretation, and program=
 analysis and optimization
* modal types for integration of inductive and co-inductive types, higher-o=
rder abstract syntax, strong functional programming
* models of constructive modal logics such as algebraic, categorical, Kripk=
e, topological, and realizability interpretations
* notions of proof for constructive modal logics
* extraction of constraints or programs from modal proofs
* proof search methods for constructive modal logics and their implementati=
ons

The workshop continues a series of previous LICS-affiliated workshops, whic=
h were held as part of FLoC'99, Trento, Italy and of FLoC'02,
Copenhagen, Denmark.

We solicit submissions on work in progress and on more mature results. Subm=
issions should be extended abstracts of 5-10 pages sent in
PostScript or PDF format to the program co-chair at aleksn@microsoft.com.

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission: April 25, 2008
Notification: May 23, 2008
Final papers due: June 7, 2008
Workshop Date: June 23, 2008

It is planned to publish workshop proceedings as Electronic Notes in Theore=
tical Computer Science (ENTCS) or in CEURS, to be decided. Authors please u=

Might be interesting to note that Cauchy and filters with convergence
etc can be described now in more generality involving underlying
(partially ordered) monads.

See e.g.

I've (re-)found this one:
 Eva Lowen-Colebunders (1989).
 Function Classes of Cauchy Continuous Maps.
 Dekker, New York, 1989.
This has many pretty diagrams of various categories of spaces,
all included in one another by bireflections and the like.

The whole subject seems messy, as point-set topology can be,
(there are too many categories around to keep track of),
and probably needs to be cleaned up somewhat
before outsiders (including me) can get a grasp on it;
in particular, perhaps locales would be a better approach.
OTOH, my reference is nearly 20 years old,
and perhaps the situation has improved.
Indeed, perhaps this is what Paul Ekland's references are doing;
I haven't looked at them carefully yet.

Is there a cartesian closed concrete category which
is small enough to write out explicitly?  It would be
helpful in learning about map objects, exponentiation,
distributivity and etc.   Can such a category be made
with binary numbers for instance?

Thanks,             ... Peter E.

How about the full category of finite sets? Or, =

if that's not small enough, and you really fancy an example

> ... made with binary numbers for instance ,

try the skeletal version of the full category of "sets of cardinality < 2=
"
having as only objects the ordinal numbers 0 and 1.

Here 0 x A =3D 0, 1 x A =3D A, 0^1 =3D 0, 0^0 =3D 1, 1^A =3D 1.
In other words, B x A =3D min(A, B), B^A =3D max(1-A, B).

How about finite sets and functions?

Not just a CCC but an elementary topos.

I'm not sure what you mean by "binary numbers", but the powerset
of  n  is  2^n   (I wonder why Cantor introduced this notation?),
and the subsets of  n  are n-digit binary numbers.

As for more general function spaces, maybe it's worth an
undergraduate exercise to see whether there's a neat
representation.

NBB:  You don't need even to have heard of domain theory
to find examples of CCCs!

Or, in case that's too small, what about any short chain? For
instance, let S = {0,1,2,3} and say there exists a morphism a -> b iff
a < b. I believe this is cartesian closed, and I believe it can easily
be understood as concrete. This should be enough to give non-trivial
product and exponentiation, but you can still draw the whole diagram.

Dear category theorists,

    Given a commutative semiring R, construct the category that has
nonnegative integers as objects, and matrices with entries in R as
morphisms, such that the hom-set from N to M consists of matrices with M
rows and N columns. This is then just the category of finitely-generated
free R-modules. It admits a symmetric monoidal structure given by tensor
product of modules, and has finite biproducts, with the induced
CMon-enrichment agreeing with addition in R. Is there a nice way to
characterise the semirings R for which this category has binary equalisers,
and hence all finite limits?

    Note that the category is equal to its opposite, identifying each matrix
with its transpose, and so it will have finite colimits iff it has finite
limits. Also, we assume that our semiring has a 0 and a 1, is distributive,
and that x.0=0.x=0 for all x in R.

                     Jamie.

PS: There was a interesting discussion of this towards the end of this page:

A Heyting algebra, viewed as a category (every poset is a category), is
a CCC. If you take a small Heyting algebra, e.g. the topology of a
finite topological space, you can write it out explicitly.

If you would like a CCC made from n-bit binary numbers, here is how you
can do it:

The two-point lattice B = {0, 1} is a Boolean algebra with the usual
logical connectives as the operations. Because B is a poset with 0<=1,
it is also a category (with two objects 0, 1 and a morphism between
them). Since every Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra, B is cartesian
closed, with the following structure:
- 1 is the terminal object
- the product X x Y is the conjuction X & Y
- the exponential Y^X is the implicatoin X => Y

The product of n copies of B is the same thing as n-tuples of bits,
i.e., the n-bit numbers. This is again a CCC (with coordinate-wise
structure).

At this late hour I cannot see what can be said about finite CCC's which
are not (eqivalent to) posets.

Indeed, are there any at all? If you have coproducts you can define
the infinite collection of objectss 0,1,2,... and if you identify any
of those you get equational  inconsistency. A similar construction
should also work for CCCs. In the simply typed lambda calculus with
one base type o you can iterpret n as o^n -> o and you get equational
inconsistency if you identify any two finite types. This carries over
to a finite collection of base types, and hence there cannot be a
finite CCC which isn't a preorder. I am sure there must be a more
elegant proof of this.

Cheers,
Thorsten

Every finite category with binary products is a preorder: any two
objects A,B have at most one arrow A-->B.  Otherwise the successive
powers of B would have unboundedly many arrows from A.

This is Peter Freyd's proof that small complete categories are
preorders.  Andrei would have thought of it at a more reasonable hour.

While I offer no answer, I will point out that coequalizers here =

(and, by the same token, equalizers) need not look like what you
might expect. For example, when the commutative semiring R is the
ordinary ring of integers, so that the category of R-matrices "is" =

the full category of f.-g. free abelian groups, the coequalizer of
the pair of 1x1 matrices (2): 1 --> 1 and (0): 1 --> 1 exists and
is !: 1-->0 , with the "expected" coequalizer value of Z/2Z being =

"unavailable here."

So: beware! Cheers, -- Fred

Have you come across the following strong monad?

Until I learn that it already has a name, I'll temporarily call it the
selection monad, and denote it by S = (S,mu,eta).

It is defined on an arbitrary cartesian closed category C after
choosing an object V of C.  Probably a monoidal closed category will
do, but I haven't paused to consider this.

On objects, define SX = X^(V^X) = ((X -> V) -> X). (One can
contravariantly change the value object V, but I won't consider this
in this message.)

Think of elements of V^X as V-valued predicates, ranged over by p, and
of elements of SX as selection functionals, ranged over by epsilon
(like Hilbert's epsilon operator). Intuition: epsilon(p) picks an
element x of X (perhaps among elements of a subset A of X) such that
p(x) holds, if such an element exists.

On morphisms f : X -> Y, define Sf: SX -> SY, using the
lambda-calculus, with "\" as the notation for "lambda", and "o" for
composition:

       Sf : SX       ->  SY
            epsilon |->  \p.f(epsilon(p o f))

This is easily seen to be functorial. Intuition: if epsilon selects
elements among a subset A of X, then Sf(epsilon) selects elements
among the set f(A). To do that, we first find an element x in A such
that p(f(x)) holds, and then apply f to it.

For the unit, take

       eta :: X   ->  SX
              x  |->  \p.x

Intuition: epsilon = eta(x) selects elements in the singleton set {x},
no matter which predicate p is given.

For multiplication, take

       mu : S(S X)  -> S X
            E      |-> \p. E(\epsilon. p(epsilon p)) p

Intuition: Given a selection operator E of selection operators, and
given a predicate p, we select a selection operator epsilon, among the
ones that E can select, such that epsilon selects an element x =
epsilon(p) with p(x), and then apply such a selection operator to p to
finally get such an element x.

The unit and associativity laws are easily (but a bit laboriously)
verified.

This monad is strong, with strength t = t_{X,Y} defined by

       t : X x SY        ->  S(X x Y)
          (x,  epsilon) |->  \p.(x, epsilon(\y.p(x,y)))

Intuition: if epsilon selects elements among a subset B of Y,
then t(x,epsilon) selects elements among the set {x} x B.

This of course, using the monad structure and cartesian closedness,
extends to a map

    times :  SX x SY -> S(X x Y)

Intuition: if epsilon_X and epsilon_Y select elements among sets A and
B, then times(epsilon_X,epsilon_Y) selects among elements of A x B.

(I don't think the strength is commutative.)

Of course, one is familiar with the "continuation" monad QX=V^(V^X).
There is a monad morphism

     SX        ->  QX
     epsilon  |->  \p. p(epsilon p)

My question is: have you come across the strong monad S (and its
relationship to the monad Q)? Of course, S has many interesting
submonads for particular choices of V, which correspond to submonads
of Q that have been considered.

I carry on a bit further.

Suppose our category C has a nno N=(N,s,0), and write x+1=sx.

Then we can define a natural isomorphism cons = cons_X

    cons : X x X^N  <--->  X^N : (head,tail)

with head(alpha)=alpha(0) and tail(alpha)(n)=alpha(n+1). Then, as is
well known, the map (head,tail) is a final coalgebra for the functor
(-) -> X x (-).

I want to consider the composite mul = (S cons) o times,

   mul : SX x S(X^N) -> S(X^N)

For a sequence alpha = epsilon_0, epsilon_1, epsilon_2 ... of epsilon
operators in SX, we may attempt to define the infinitely iterated
product

   mul(epsilon_0, mul(epsilon_1, mul(epsilon_2, ...) ... ))

It turns out that, in particular categories of interest, with a
suitable choice of V, this exists. Moreover, there is a unique
functional that picks the product selection operator, given the
selection operators for the components:

   prod : (SX)^N -> S(X^N)

   prod(cons(epsilon,alpha)) = mul(epsilon, prod alpha)

or, equivalently,

   prod o cons = mul o (id x prod)

and so this is a kind of algebra homomorphism. The odd thing is that
cons is the inverse of the final coalgebra, and, for this particular
situation, it is instead playing the role of an initial algebra with
respect to mul.  (Of course, we are all familiar with odd situations
of this kind.)

There is no reason why such a unique morphism prod should exist in an
arbitrary ccc with a chosen V, and counter-examples are readily
obtained.

My original example of prod was constructed before I realized there
was a monad behind it, and was given by a construction that now can be
considered to be rather ad hoc, but that is readily seen to be
equivalent to the above formulation. So this message is a sort of
apology for overlooking obvious considerations.

The example was given in a ccc of computable higher-type functionals
(defined on continuous functionals), with V the booleans, and, the
point, was indeed, that prod is well defined and computable.  I had
considered another (more efficient) product functional, based on
(seeing sequences as) binary trees. This also is explained, in very
much the same (and obvious) way, by the above considerations, but I
won't spell it down in this message, which is already long.

To compare it with the ad hoc algorithms, I have coded the above
categorical definitions in the higher-type programming language
Haskell, including the definition of prod derived from them, for both
sequences and trees.  The performance in particular examples is the
same as that of the ad hoc previously given algorithms, apart from a
constant factor of approximately 1/2.

I could, in principle, have started from the categorical ideas of this
message and then derived the algorithms. I wish I had done that.  In
any case, here are the algorithms as they are derived in this message
(including the tree-like product functional):

Dear Colleagues,
   This is an invitation to attend the 2008 Clifford Lectures, which
will be held at Tulane from March 12 through March 15, 2008. The
Clifford Lectures are annual series of lectures hosted by the Tulane
Math Department in honoring of A. H. Clifford, noted algebraist, who
was a long time member of the department. This year's Clifford
Lecturer is Samson Abramsky, and the topic of his lectures is,
"Information flow in physics, geometry, logic and computation". Samson
will deliver five lectures on this topic during the course of the
series. In addition, thirteen researchers are also giving one-hour
lectures on this topic as part of the series. You can find details
about the speakers, the titles and abstracts of their talks, the
program and registration information at the page http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mwm/clifford

Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic 87
Honouring the 70th birthday of Anders Kock

Patras, 21-23 March 2008

The 87th Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will be held in Patras,
Greece, on 22-23 March 2008.
An extra session will be held in the afternoon of Friday 21 March,
celebrating the 70th birthday of Anders Kock.
A. Joyal, F. W. Lawvere and G. Reyes will participate honouring Anders.


Accommodation Information:

The University of Patras is located in the suburbs, 10 km NE of the
downtown area.
The participants have the options of either staying downtown or in one
of the hotels along the coast near the University.
In the first case they will have to use local transportation (bus or taxi=
).
In the second case they may choose to walk
(weather permitting) or get a ride by the people involved in the
organization. With the second option in mind, a number of rooms has been
reserved at Hotel Achaia Beach and will be available at the price of 69
Euros (single room)  and 85 Euros (double room), provided that reservatio=
n
is confirmed before 15 January 2008.
The hotel is 2,5 km away from the PSSL venue and has the extra advantage
of being close to some fine restaurants and in walking distance from the
cafes, bars and restaurants of the coast of Rion, which starts getting
lively at that time of the year. A small number of rooms will be availabl=
e
until Friday 22 February 2008.

If you wish to book a hotel room yourself you may consult

http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g189488-Patras_Peloponnese-Hotels.html

Registration: You may register for PSSL87 by filling out the following fo=

I wish to book a hotel room in Achaia Beach Hotel: YES/NO - SINGLE/DOUBLE

and submitting it to
pssl87@math.upatras.gr


Transportation Information:

Patras is located 220km W of the Athens airport. The best way to approach
it is to use the Athens Suburban Railway (Proastiakos) which stretches
west up to the town of Kiato, on the northern coast of the Peloponnese,
110km away from Patras. The idea is to arrange some private car or coach
rides from Kiato to Patras, according to the date and time of arrival of
most of you. Otherwise there is the option of getting on the (slow, narro=
w
gauge) train to Patras.

Further details as well as a list of participants appear in the
meeting's webpage

Dear colleagues,

I'd like to draw your attention to an opening for a tenure (track)
position at Utrecht, at the level of "universitair docent" (comparable
to Lecturer in the UK, Assistant Professor in the US or Maitre de
Conferences in France). The position is related to a large group grant
in the area between (and including) geometry/topology and mathematical
physics, which I'm sure will fit the interests of many readers of this
list.

For more information, see http://www.math.uu.nl/Main/Department/Positions=
/

It is vacancy #62800 on the list of four.

With best regards,

Ieke Moerdijk.

FM'08: 15TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FORMAL METHODS


May 26 - 30, 2008

=C5bo Akademi University

Turku, Finland



CALL FOR PARTICIPATION



http://www.fm2008.abo.fi/



It is our pleasure to invite you to FM'08, the premier international foru=
m
for practitioners and researchers applying mathematical methods to the
design of highly reliable computer systems.

FM'08 is the fifteenth in a series of symposia organized by Formal Method=
s
Europe, http://www.fmeurope.org, an independent association whose aim is
to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for software
development. The symposia have been notably successful in bringing
together innovators and practitioners in precise mathematical methods for
software development, industrial users as well as researchers.



A program of five invited talks and 23 outstanding research papers
provides the opportunity to learn about the newest developments in the
theory and application of formal methods. The program covers a wide range
of topics, including real-time and concurrency, design, verification,
communication, runtime monitoring and analysis, constraint analysis,
programming language analysis, formal methods practice, and grand
challenge problems. As in the previous years, an Industry Day is dedicate=
d
for practitioners to share their experiences with industrial applications=
.
This year's Industry Day investigates telecommunications and embedded
systems, being supported by NOKIA. Speakers from five major industries
will address this year's theme, together with the Johnson Professor Arvin=
d
from MIT.

Tutorials are a central part of this year=92s FM symposium, as an effecti=
ve
way of disseminating emerging application areas, tools, and techniques.
This year we have seven tutorials, given by renowned experts in their
fields. The five co-located workshops address issues of specific formal
techniques as well as novel computational models and grand challenges. Th=
e
following list of tutorials and workshops are available:

Tutorials

=B7         Computational Systems Biology

=B7         Teaching formal methods to students in high school and
introductory university courses

=B7         Refinement workshop

=B7         Pilot Projects for the Grand Challenge in Verified Software

=B7         Computational Models for Cell Processes

A Doctoral Symposium on all aspects of formal methods research is also
part of FM=9208, giving young researchers the opportunity to have their
ideas critically, but constructively examined by the community. A Poster
and Tool Exhibition of both research projects and commercial tools allows
researchers to engage in a dialogue with potential users in early phases
of their work. The submission date for the both the Doctoral Symposium an=
d
the Poster and Tool Exhibition is March 7.

Registration to all types of events will open during week 8, with the
possibility of early registration until March 25. Important dates for
submitting papers to the workshops should be identified via the own
homepages of these events, reachable from above or from the FM=9208 websi=
te.
Generally, workshop papers should be submitted in March. The list of the
accepted papers to the technical symposium and the preliminary schedule o=
f
FM=9208 can already be retrieved via our website.

We hope you will enjoy a rewarding symposium program!

The MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic,
and computer science which are related to models of computation, in
general, and to the semantics of programming languages, in particular.
The series has particularly stressed providing a forum where
researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and exchange
ideas about problems of common interest. As the series also strives to
maintain breadth in its scope, the conference strongly encourages
participation by researchers in neighboring areas.

TOPICS include, but are not limited to, the following: biocomputation;
categorical models; concurrent and distributed computation;
constructive mathematics; domain theory; formal languages; formal
methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; logic; non-classical
computation; probabilistic systems; process calculi; program analysis;
programming-language theory; quantum computation; rewriting theory;
security; specifications; topological models; type systems; type
theory.

Is there a version of Mitchell-Benabou language for internal categories
in toposes (with natural number objects)? What I have in mind is
something that will allow automatic translations of definitions and
proofs to internal categories that gives the expected results for
established notions. [I have glanced through "Relative set theories",
and the relevant chapters of Jacobs, "Categorical logic and type
theory"; they do not seem to what I am looking for, in the sense that
the primary focus is not on the properties of the internal category.]

Thanks in advance
Nath Rao

Various people (including Moerdijk & Palmgren, Hyland & Gambino,
Abbott & Altenkirch & Ghani) have considered locally cartesian closed
pretoposes with W-types, ie initial algebras for generalized
polynomial functors, aka 'containers'. (These W-types are an
appropriate analysis of the fixed points of intensional constructions
and so these categories have been motivated as "constructive toposes",
as models of a particular version of Martin-Lof's type theory).

Lcc pretoposes are Heyting pretoposes. For any object X, consider
those monotone endofunctions on the class Sub(X) that can be
constructed from the pullback functors and their left and right
adjoints. By my calculations, in a topos, these monotone endofunctions
have least and greatest fixed points (by internalizing them and then
using Tarski's fixed point theorem).

It seems that, in general, these monotone endofunctions will not have
least or greatest fixed points in lcc pretoposes with W-types. (I
haven't proved this, though, and perhaps I have missed a neat trick.)

If I'm not mistaken, this is a mismatch. Lcc pretoposes let you work
both intensionally and extensionally, yet when it comes to W-types, we
only consider the intensional constructions. Is there a reason for
this?-- are these fixed points "non-constructive" or "impredicative"
in some sense?

Has anybody thought about these things before? Have I missed
something? All the best, Sam


[My example is bisimilarity for transition systems, as studied in
concurrency theory. This is conventionally calculated as a maximum
fixed point for a monotone endofunction on the lattice of binary
relations. I can define a 'constructive' version of bisimilarity using
W-types, and then take the image. This differs from the usual notion,
unless choice is assumed.]

Hi All,

Since we have a semantic characterisation of containers, we can look
at Thorstens question

Surely, it must be the case that all syntactically definable
endofunctors are accessible.

And, being syntactic constructions, I'd not be too surprised if they
preserved connected limits ...

Unless I've got the wrong end of the stick which is entirely possible.

All the best
Neil

Hi Sam,

the issue you address has to do with the question of predicative vs.
impredicative, I think.

As you say in a topos any monotone operator on the lattice of subsets
of a given type has a least (and greatest fixpoint). In a predicative
theory like Martin-Loef's Type Theory these fixpoints only exist if
the monotone operator is defined in a *strictly* positive way.

There seems to be no simple example of such a fixpoint because all
simple examples turn out to be strictly positive. Here is the
simplest one I can think of in the moment: Let (A,@) be a partial
combinatory algebra, e.g. the natural number with an encoding of
Turing machines. Then choose a subset R \subseteq A to define an
antitone operator F on subsets of A by

	F P = { x:A | all y:A.P y -> R (x @ y) }

Now clearly FF (do F twice) is monotone and hence will have a least
fixpoint in a topos. However, by a proof-theoretic analysis (I think)
we can show that the fixpoint cannot be constructed in Martin-Loef
Type Theory. (It would be nicer to have a semantical argument).

Btw this is just an encoding of Reynold's construction to show that
there are no set-theoretic models of System F. In System F you get a
fixpoint of (X -> 2) -> 2 which corresponds to choosing R to be an
encoding of 2, e.g.
R = {\xy.x,\xy.y}.

There is a semantic characterisation of strictly positive operators
on subsets which is similar to the concept of containers, I have used
this in joint work with Andreas Abel a while ago (our JFP 2002 paper
and TYPES 99). It would be nice, if one could show that all operators
which have fixpoints are one of those. Alternatively for containers:
Every endofunctor which has an initial algebra is a container.
Obviously, this will only hold in the syntax of Type Theory, i.e. the
classifying predicative pretopos with W-types.

I am not sure this mismatch is a problem: Do you ever need fixpoints
of non-strict positive operators?

Cheers,
Thorsten

The following are available from my preprint page, by me unless stated =
otherwise:=20

http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/brownpr.html

1) 08.04 Exact sequences of fibrations of crossed complexes, homotopy =
classification of maps, and nonabelian extensions of groups=20
ABSTRACT:  The classifying space of a crossed complex generalises the =
construction of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. We show how the theory of =
fibrations of crossed complexes allows the analysis of homotopy classes =
of maps from a free crossed complex to such a classifying space. This =
gives results on the homotopy classification of maps from a CW-complex =
to the classifying space of a crossed module and also, more generally, =
of a crossed complex whose homotopy groups vanish in dimensions between =
1 and n. The results are analogous to those for the obstruction to an =
abstract kernel in group extension theory.=20

2) 06.04 R. Brown, I. Morris, J. Shrimpton and C.D. Wensley=20

Graphs of morphisms of graphs=20

 ABSTRACT: This is an account for the combinatorially minded reader of =
various categories of directed and undirected graphs, and their =
analogies with the category of sets. As an application, the =
endomorphisms of a graph are in this context not only composable, giving =
a monoid structure, but also have a notion of adjacency, so that the set =
of endomorphisms is both a monoid and a graph. We extend Shrimpton's =
(unpublished) investigations on the morphism digraphs of reflexive =
digraphs to the undirected case by using an equivalence between a =
category of reflexive, undirected graphs and the category of reflexive, =
directed graphs with reversal. In so doing, we emphasise a picture of =
the elements of an undirected graph, as involving two types of edges =
with a single vertex, namely `bands' and `loops'. Such edges are =
distinguished by the behaviour of morphisms with respect to these =
elements.

3) Possible connections between whiskered categories and groupoids, many =
object Lie algebras, automorphism structures and local-to-global =
questions=20

ABSTRACT: We define the notion of whiskered categories and groupoids and =
discuss potential applications and extensions, for example to a many =
object Lie theory, and to resolutions of monoids. This paper is more an =
outline of a possible programme or programmes than giving conclusive =
results.=20

4) A new higher homotopy groupoid: the fundamental  globular =
$\omega$-groupoid  of a filtered space=20
MSC Classification:18D10, 18G30, 18G50, 20L05, 55N10, 55N25.
KEY WORDS: filtered space, higher homotopy van Kampen theorem, cubical =
singular complex, free globular  groupoid
ABSTRACT: We show that the graded set of filter homotopy classes rel =
vertices of maps from the $n$-globe to a filtered space may be given the =
structure of globular $\omega$--groupoid. The proofs use an analogous =
fundamental cubical $\omega$--groupoid due to the author and Philip =
Higgins. This method also relates the construction to the fundamental =
crossed complex of a filtered space, and this relation allows the proof =
that the crossed complex associated to the free globular =
$\omega$-groupoid on one element of dimension $n$ is the fundamental =
crossed complex of the $n$-globe.=20

[Note from moderator: Please cc: any expressions of interest to
tac@mta.ca]

TAC has been in existence now for 13 years.  For about the first half of
its existence, Bob did everything to get papers ready for publication.  He
did consult with me if he had particular tex problems.  About when I
retired, I took on the task of preparing papers (most of them) for
publication.  However I am uncomfortable with being the only one who
really understands what is going on with tac.cls.  I would like to find a
volunteer to back me up, with a view to eventually taking over when the
times comes, as it must, that I can no longer do the job.

The job is not onerous.  We get about 20 papers a year.  On average, a
paper takes a couple hours of preparation.  Sometimes it is more, but
often there is essentially no prep time since the author has used tac.cls
and made no formatting errors.

I am not planning on stopping this any time soon, but I think it is past
time to prepare for the future.

Michael

[Note from moderator:  To reiterate: expressions of interest in the backup
TeX editor position for TAC should be sent directly to Michael Barr,
<barr@math.mcgill.ca>, and not to this mailing list. Thanks for those
already sent. The TAC request that authors submit a single source file has
nothing to do with archiving. Its purpose is to simplify slightly the
editors' work.]

Dear Mike,

In response to your request for volunteers to take over the
TeXnical management of TAC,  I would certainly consider taking
part in a committee to undertake this.

I believe that I am qualified for the job.  TeX has an error message,
"Interwoven alignment preambles are not allowed", about which the
TeXbook (p299) says, "If you have been so devious as to get this
message, you will know what it means, and you will deserve no
sympathy".  I got it in about 1992, developing my diagrams package,
and take it as my qualification to be a "TeXpert".

There is, however, a condition, namely that TAC's use of LaTeX be
brought up to date.   In particular, macros should be separated
in a modular fashion from mathematics.  You insist on their being
pasted in-line for the dubious reason of trying to archive papers
as single files, whereas anybody else would use a directory (folder).

Since I am making this offer in public, I would like to take the
opportunity to point out to users of my diagrams package that
version 3.91 has expired, and they should get a new one from
	www.PaulTaylor.EU/diagrams
Also, even in V 3.91, the option "noPostScript" has been renamed
"UglyObsolete", as a further attempt to get people to stop using
the pre-1992 code that uses LaTeX-style diagonal lines.

Best wishes,
Paul Taylor
