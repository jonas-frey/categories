Many thanks to all who replied to my message, in private and publicly.

I notice that these concerns also arose on this mailing list back in
1992:
http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/archive/1992/92-06.txt

At that time, Michael Barr was asking, amongst other things, about the
exactness property that "every Mal'cev [=difunctional=z-closed]
relation is a pullback", which holds both in toposes and in abelian
categories (as I mentioned below). I wonder if anything more came out
of that. He mentioned a possible connection with "effective unions",
but I haven't been able to get anything to work there.

By the way, following the comments about Mal'cev operators, and Peter
Freyd's "Mal'cev allegories", I note that (exact) categories in which
every relation is difunctional have been called "Mal'cev
categories" [see e.g. the book by Bourn and Borceux on the topic
(pointed out by Peter Lumsdaine), or Carboni, Lambek, Pedicchio,
Diagram chasing in Mal'cev categories, JPAA 69].

Dear All

For a Lie group G and a vector space V,
C^{\infty}(G,V) is a differentiably injective G-module
(Hochschild-Mostow).

Is there an analoguous construction
for a Lie groupoid or, in the algebraic setting,
cogroupoid object in the category of commutative algebras?

Let G be a Lie groupoid, with object manifold G_o,
source and target maps being supposed surjective submersions.
A G-module is a vector bundle

V \to G_o

on G_o with a G-structure
(pairing G x_G_o V to V over G_o satisfying the obvious compatiblity
conditions).

If we start with a vector bundle V to G_o on G_o,
what corresponds to the construction

C^{\infty}(G,V)

for the special case where G is an ordinary Lie group?

More generally, G being a Lie groupoid,
does the category of G-modules have enough injectives?

Where in the literature can I find answers to these questions
if any?

Many thanks in advance

Regards

Johannes

Getting to the loria from the train station:

Take the tram in the "CHU Brabois" direction and get off at the
Callot stop.
Look at

for a more precise view of the Loria's location on the science campus.

Note: the visitor's entrance is in the A Building again
so entering the premises if you don't have a badge is quite intuitive.

A Modular Calculus for the Average Cost of Data Structuring
Schellekens, Michel
2008, 20 illus. With CD-ROM., Hardcover
ISBN: 978-0-387-73383-8

A Modular Calculus for the Average Cost of Data Structuring introduces
MOQA, a new domain-specific programming language which guarantees the
average-case time analysis of its programs to be modular. "Time" in this
context refers to a broad notion of cost, which can be used to estimate
the actual running time, but also other quantitative information such as
power consumption, while modularity means that the average time of a
program can be easily computed from the times of its
constituents--something that no programming language of this scope has
been able to guarantee so far. MOQA principles can be incorporated in
any standard programming language.

MOQA supports tracking of data and their distributions throughout
computations, based on the notion of random bag preservation. This
allows a unified approach to average-case time analysis, and resolves
fundamental bottleneck problems in the area. The main techniques are
illustrated in an accompanying Flash tutorial, where the visual nature
of this method can provide new teaching ideas for algorithms courses.

This volume, with forewords by Greg Bollella and Dana Scott, presents
novel programs based on the new advances in this area, including the
first randomness-preserving version of Heapsort. Programs are provided,
along with derivations of their average-case time, to illustrate the
radically different approach to average-case timing. The automated
static timing tool applies the Modular Calculus to extract the
average-case running time of programs directly from their MOQA code.

A Modular Calculus for the Average Cost of Data Structuring is designed
for a professional audience composed of researchers and practitioners in
industry, with an interest in algorithmic analysis and also static
timing and power analysis--areas of growing importance. It is also
suitable as an advanced-level text or reference book for students in
computer science, electrical engineering and mathematics.

affiliations of authors, a brief synopsis, and the contact author's
name, address, phone number, fax number, and email address. Papers
must be in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program
committee to assess their merits. They should begin with a succinct
statement of the issues, a summary of the main results, and a brief
explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference,
all phrased for the non-specialist. Technical development directed to
the specialist should follow. References and comparisons with related
work should be included. If the authors believe more details are
necessary to substantiate the main claims of the paper, they may
include a clearly marked appendix to be read at the discretion of
the committee. Submissions departing significantly from these
guidelines risk rejection.

The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or
workshops. All authors of accepted papers will be expected to sign
copyright release forms. One author of each accepted paper will be
expected to present it at the conference.

It is anticipated that the proceedings of the conference will be
published by Springer-Verlag in Lecture Notes in Computer Science.

                      PhD Position
                          in
  Operational and Categorical Approaches to Parametricity

      Department of Computer and Information Sciences
           University of Strathclyde, Scotland


Applications are invited for one PhD position within the newly-formed
Mathematically Structured Programming group at the University of
Strathclyde. The group comprises Prof. Neil Ghani, Dr. Patricia Johann,
and Dr. Conor McBride. The funded PhD project centers around operational
and categorical approaches to relational parametricity, which serves as
the basis for deriving both structured tools for programming with, and
effective techniques for reasoning about, functional programs, solely from
their (polymorphic) types. The project aims to develop the theoretical
foundations of parametricity for languages supporting advanced datatypes
--- such as nested types, GADTs, and their mixed-variance versions --- as
well as to apply these foundations to program transformations and other
applications. The project is under the direction of Patricia Johann.

The successful applicant will have an MSc in Mathematics or Computing
Science or a related subject with a strong Mathematics or Computing
Science component. Ideally, they will also have a strong, documented
interest in doing research. Strong mathematical background and
problem-solving skills are essential; good programming skills are a plus.
Prior knowledge in the areas of operational semantics, category theory,
and/or parametricity is an advantage, but is not required.

The PhD position is for 3 years; the start date is negotiable. The
position is a fully-funded post for a home (i.e., UK) student, and
includes both coverage of fees and an EPSRC-level stipend for each of the
three years. For European students, the post covers only fees (i.e., no
stipend is available).

More information about the department is available at

       http://www.strath.ac.uk/cis

The University of Strathclyde (http://www.strath.ac.uk) is located in the
heart of Glasgow, which Lonely Planet Travel Guides hail as "one of
Britain's largest, liveliest and most interesting cities" (see
http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/scotland/glasgow/). Southern
Scotland provides a particularly stimulating environment for researchers
in theoretical computer science, with active groups in this area at
Heriot-Watt University, the University of Edinburgh, the University of
Glasgow, the University of St. Andrews, and the University of Strathclyde.

Requests for further information and other informal enquiries can be sent
to:

       Patricia Johann
       Patricia.Johann at cis.strath.ac.uk

(The group is currently in the process of moving to the University of
Strathclyde, so the above is the best contact address for the duration of
the summer. Students interested in joining the group to work on other
topics should contact Prof. Ghani at Neil.Ghani at cis.strath.ac.uk, since
further positions are expected soon.

Those interested in the position are asked to send e-mail to the address
given above. Full Details of the application process are available upon
request, but an application will include:

   1. A cover letter stating the applicant's specific interest in the
      project.

   2. A full curriculum vitae, including an abstract of the applicant's
      graduate thesis and the name of their supervisor.

   3. Letters of recommendation or references from at least two
      scientific staff members. (Letters of recommendation should either
      be included along with the application, or should arrive
      separately promptly.)

   4. A completed application for postgraduate study at the University
      of Strathclyde.

Applications, forms for letters of recommendation, and instructions are
available at

       http://www.strath.ac.uk/prospectus/postgraduateapplications/

Applications will be considered until the position is filled, but those
received on or before

       15 August 2008

will have priority.

   21st European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
                            ESSLLI 2009
             Monday, 20 July --- Friday, 31 July 2009

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

                  CALL FOR COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
                  --------------------------------------

The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI)
is organized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and
Information (FoLLI, http://www.folli.org) in different sites around
Europe.

The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics,
logic and computation.  ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and
advanced courses, as well as workshops, covering a wide variety of
topics within the three areas of interest: Language and Computation,
Language and Logic, and Logic and Computation.

Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to
500 students from Europe and elsewhere.  The school has developed into
an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and
researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of Logic,
Language and Information.

The ESSLLI 2009 Program Committee invites proposals for
foundational, introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops
for the 21st annual Summer School in the broad interdisciplinary
area connecting logic, linguistics, computer science and the
cognitive sciences. The Summer School program is organized around
the components.

    - Language and Computation
    - Language and Logic
    - Logic and Computation

We also welcome proposals that do not exactly fit one of these
there categories.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: Proposals should be submitted through a web form
available at http://www.folli.org/submission.php

All proposals should be submitted no later than

                 ******* Monday, September 1, 2008 *******

Authors of proposals will be notified of the committee's decision no
later than Wednesday October 15, 2008.  Proposers should follow the
guidelines below while preparing their submissions; proposals that
deviate can not be considered.

GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION: Anyone interested in lecturing or
organizing a workshop during ESSLLI-2009, please read the following
information carefully.

ALL COURSES: Courses consists of five sessions (a one-week course),
each session lasting 90 minutes.  Lecturers who want to offer a long,
two-week course should submit two independent one-week courses (for
example an introductory course in the first week of ESSLLI, and a more =20=

advanced course during the second).  The ESSLLI program committee has
the right to select only one of the two proposed courses.

Timetable for Course Proposal Submission:

    Sept 1, 2008: Proposal Submission Deadline
    Oct 15, 2008: Notification
    June 1, 2009: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course
                  material (by ESSLLI Local Organizers)

FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are strictly elementary courses not
assuming any background knowledge.  They are intended for people to
get acquainted with the problems and techniques of areas new to them.
Ideally, they should allow researchers from other fields to acquire
the key competences of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the
development of a truly interdisciplinary research community.
Foundational courses may presuppose some experience with scientific
methods in general, so as to be able to concentrate on the issues that
are germane to the area of the course.

INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to the
activities of the Summer School.  They are intended to equip students
and young researchers with a good understanding of a field's basic
methods and techniques.  Introductory courses in, for instance,
Language and Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component
fields; e.g., an introductory course in computational linguistics
should address an audience which is familiar with the basics of
linguistics and computation.  Proposals for introductory courses should
indicate the level of the course as compared to standard texts in the
area (if available).

ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of
advanced Masters or PhD students.  Proposals for advanced courses
should specify the prerequisites in detail.

WORKSHOPS: The aim of the workshops is to provide a forum for advanced
Ph.D. students and other researchers to present and discuss their
work.  Workshops should have a well defined theme, and workshop
organizers should be specialists in the theme of the workshop. It is a
strict requirement that organizers give a general introduction to the
theme during the first session of the workshop.  They are also
responsible for the organization and program of the workshop
including inviting the submission of papers, reviewing, expenses of
invited speakers, etc. In particular, each workshop organizer will be
responsible for sending out a Call for Papers for the workshop by
November 17, 2008.  The call must make it clear that the workshop is
open to all members of the ESSLLI community.  It should also note that
all workshop contributors must register for the Summer School.

FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: The web-based form for submitting course and
workshop proposals is accessible at http://www.folli.org/submission.php.
You will be required to submit the following information:

    * Name (name(s) of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer)

    * Address (contact addresses of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer;
      where possible, please include phone and fax numbers)

    * Title (title of proposed course/workshop)

    * Type (is this a workshop, a foundational course, an introductory
      course, or an advanced course?)

    * Section (does your proposal fit in Language & Computation,
      Language & Logic or Logic & Computation? name only one)

    * Description (in at most 150 words, describe the proposed =20
contents and
                  substantiate timeliness and relevance to ESSLLI)

    * External funding (will you be able to find external funding to
      help fund your travel and accommodation expenses? if so, how?)

    * Further particulars (any further information that is required by
      the above guidelines should be included here; in particular, =20
indicate
      here your teaching experience in an interdisciplinary field as the
      one addressed by ESSLLI.)

FINANCIAL ASPECTS: Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers
should be aware that all teaching and organizing at the summer schools
is done on a voluntary basis in order to keep the participants fees as
low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not paid for their
contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation (up to a
fixed, maximum amount that will be notified to lecturers when courses
are accepted).  It should be stressed that while proposals from all
over the world are welcomed, the Summer School cannot guarantee full
reimbursement of travel costs, specially from destinations outside
Europe.

Please note the following: In case a course is to be taught by multiple
lecturers, a lump sum is reimbursed to cover travel and accommodation
expenses for one lecturer. The splitting of the sum is up to the
lecturers.

The local organizers highly appreciate it if, whenever possible,
lecturers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover
travel and accommodation expenses, and such issues might be taken
into account when selecting courses.

*********  CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT *************
               CATS-3
Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgi
             Pisa, Italy
           September 1-5, 2008


CATS3 is the third part of a series of conferences devoted
to higher categorical structures in algebraic geometry. The
meeting is intended to bring together experts in various
subjects related to higher categorical and homotopical techniques
in the context of algebraic geometry, as well as mathematicians from
other fields who desire to learn about the recent advances in this
area. The subjects covered by the conference will include: foundations
of the theory of higher categories and homotopical algebra, stacks
and higher stacks, derived and dg-categories, strong homotopy algebras,
non-commutative geometry, derived deformation theory and derived
algebraic geometry, non-abelian Hodge theory, string topology and
string theory, CY-categories and homological mirror symmetry.
