I apologize again: I wanted to say CT2009 of course (not CT2008), and many
thanks to those who noticed that misprint and wrote to me - and I hope its
meaning is that CT2009 will be as nice as CT2008!

I am trying to understand model-checking logics such as=20
linear temporal logic (LTL), computation tree logic (CTL),
and probabilistic extensions such as probabilistic computation
tree logic (PCTL).  These logics seem to be useful in model-
checking because of correspondences between recursive=20
definitions of formulas and recursive algorithms for
computing them.  Syntactic inference and any semantics
other than the few (transition systems, DTMCs, MDPs, etc.) for=20
which the logics were developed seem not to be of interest,=20
however.  Translation theorems such as D1.4.7, D1.4.12, and
D4.3.13 of Johnstone's "Elephant" are not applied, as far as=20
I have found.

Here are some initial thoughts based on my very limited=20
knowledge of categorical logic.  The temporal logic operators=20
"next", "eventually", and "always" may, for example,=20
be formulated using a propositional signature. Let A be a set=20
whose elements are thought of as state labels.  The set of=20
atomic propositions is {a_n | a in A, n in N}.  The following=20
are Horn formulas:

Next^n[a]       =3D a_n

Always^k[a]     =3D a_0 \wedge ... \wedge a_k

T^k[a, b]       =3D a_0 \wedge ... \wedge a_{k-1} \wedge b_k

The following are coherent formulas:

Until^k[a, b]   =3D T^0[a, b] \vee ... \vee T^k[a, b]

Eventually^k[a] =3D a_0 \vee ... \vee a_k

The following are geometric formulas:

Until[a, b]     =3D \vee_i T^i[a, b]

Eventually[a]   =3D \vee_i a_i

The following is infinitary:

Always[a]       =3D \wedge_i a_i.

Alternatively, these notions can be formulated as a=20
first-order theory with basic sorts "States" and "Paths". =20
It has function symbols

start : Paths -> States

shift : Paths -> Paths

and a set A of of relation symbols=20

a |-> States.

PCTL can be formulated as a \tau-theory.  It has basic sorts=20
States and Paths as above as well as the function symbols=20
start and shift.  It also has function symbols=20

Prob_{<p}:P(Paths) -> P(States)=20

(similarly for \leq, >, and \geq) for 0 \leq p\leq 1 and

Cost_{<c}:P(S) -> P(S)=20

(similarly for \leq, >, and \geq) for 0 \leq c.

There are certainly other presentations of these theories. =20
Finally, here are a few questions.

Has anyone studied the model-checking logics using the tools
of categorical logic?

What interactions exist between bisimulation/probabilistic=20
bisimulation and the logics?

What role could categorical logic have in developing model-
checking algorithms?

How can the usual semantics of these theories (e.g., DTMC=20
semantics for PCTL) be viewed categorically (e.g., in the=20
topos Set by interpreting the sorts simply as sets of states
and paths)?

Any other thoughts, suggestions, or references would be=20
appreciated.

I chose Chen's framework when Urs Schreiber and I were doing some work
in mathematical physics and we needed a "convenient category" of smooth
spaces.  I decided to choose one that was easy to explain to people
brainwashed by the "default paradigm", in which spaces are sets equipped
with extra structure.  Later I realized I needed to write a paper
establishing some properties of Chen's framework.  By doing that I guess
I'm guilty of reinforcing the default paradigm, and for that I apologize.

If I understand correctly, one can actually separate the objections
to continuing to develop Chen's theory of "differentiable spaces"
into two layers.

Let me remind everyone of Chen's 1977 definition.  He didn't state
it this way, but it's equivalent:

There's a category S whose objects are convex subsets C of R^n
(n = 0,1,2,...) and whose maps are smooth maps between these.
This category admits a Grothendieck pretopology where a cover
is an open cover in the usual sense.

A differentiable spaces is then a sheaf X on S.   We think of
X as a smooth space, and X(C) as the set of smooth maps from C to X.

But the way Chen sets it up, differentiable spaces are not all
the sheaves on S: just the "concrete" ones.

These are defined using the terminal object 1 in S.  Any convex set
C has an underlying set of points hom(1,C).  Any sheaf X on S has an
underlying set of points X(1).  Thanks to these, any element of X(C)
has an underlying function from hom(1,C) to X(1).  We say X is "concrete"
if for all C, the map sending elements of X(C) to their underlying
functions is 1-1.

The supposed advantage of concrete sheaves is that the underlying
set functor X |-> X(1) is faithful on these.  So, we can think of
them as sets with extra structure.

But this advantage is largely illusory.  The concreteness condition
is not very important in practice, and the concrete sheaves form not
a topos, but only a quasitopos.

That's one layer of objections.  Of course, *these* objections
can be answered by working with the topos of *all* sheaves on S.
This topos contains some useful non-concrete objects: for example,
an object F such that F^X is the 1-forms on X.

But now comes a second layer of objections.  This topos of sheaves
still lacks other key features of synthetic differential geometry.
Most importantly, it lacks the "infinitesimal arrow" object D such
that X^D is the tangent bundle of X.

The problem is that all the objects of S are ordinary "non-infinitesimal"
spaces.  There should only be one smooth map from any such space to D.
So as a sheaf on S, D would be indistinguishable from the 1-point space.

So I guess the real problem is that the site S is concrete: that is,
the functor assigning to any convex set C its set of points hom(1,C)
is faithful. I could be jumping to conclusions, but it seems to me
that that sheaves on a concrete site can never serve as a framework
for differential geometry with infinitesimals.

Best,
jb

In

L. S. Completions of \mu-algebras. APAL, 154(1):27-50, May 2008.

I studied the problem of the completeness of the modal mu-calculus from=20
an finitary algebraic point of view. In that paper some categorical=20
ideas, mainly from

W. Tholen, Pro-categories and multiadjoint functors, Canad. J. Math. 36=20
(1) (1984) 144=96155.

play the relevant role. The challenge is to prove that in free modal=20
\mu-algebras, the relation

\mu.f =3D \bigvee_{n>=3D0}  f^n(\bot)

holds -- where \mu.f, the least fixpoint of f, is axiomatized by=20
equational implications and free modal \mu-algebras are not known to be=20
complete.

We have received a bit of money from Concordia Univeristy towards the
Octoberfest and have decided that we would like to help out graduate students
who wish to attend.  So any grad student who is planning to attend and would
like support should write to Robert Seely (rags@math.mcgill.ca) by Sept 15 at
the latest and make a request.  We may or may not be able to help with travel
expenses, but we should be able to pay for local hotel bills, although
everything depends on how many applicants.  Participants will have to
submit original bills to be reimbursed.  Sorry, but it will be impossible
to provide money beforehand.

As usual, people wishing to talk should let us know ASAP.  Since we are trying
to arrange a lunch on Saturday, we would also appreciate knowing who is
planning to come.  Again ASAP.

Michael

Categorists,

Is there a commonly accepted language for infinitary compositions? Here's
the sort of thing i'm thinking about. There's a purely syntactic
correspondence between a 'braced' notation and an infix notation for
composition. Suppose we have a categorically-friendly notion of composition,
say c. (Meaning the entities c composes can be viewed as morphisms in a
category and c the categorical composition.) Then we can just as easily
write

   - f c g -- c is merely making notationally explicit the interpretation of
   'o' in f o g -- we're coloring the 'o', as it were

or

   - {c| f, g |c} -- we've moved from infix to (not quite) prefix notation
   for the composition.


The braced notation, however, is suggestive of a very powerful notational
mechanism, comprehension notation. We could easily imagine a language
allowing expressions of the form

{c| pattern | predicate |c}

which would denote

pattern{subst_1} c pattern{subst_2} c ...

where subst_i is a substition for 'variables' in the pattern of entities
satisfying the predicate. This would allow reasoning over infinitary
compositions by providing an intensional view of their interior structure.
Surely, such a widget has already been invented. Can someone give me a
reference?

Best wishes,

--greg

There is nothing deep in the following, but it is amusing and slightly
surprising.  In the well-known diagram below (the dots indicate spaces,
which email doesn't handle well):

........0........0.......0..........

........|........|.......|..........
........|........|.......|..........
........|........|.......|..........
........v........v.......v..........

0 ----> A' ----> A ----> A'' ----> 0

0 ----> C' ----> C ----> C'' ----> 0

........|........|.......|..........
........|........|.......|..........
........|........|.......|..........
........v........v.......v..........
........0........0.......0..........

it is widely known that if the three columns, middle row and one of the
other two rows is exact, so is the remaining row.  What if the upper and
lower rows are exact (along with the three columns)?  It might not be a
complex, that is it might happen that gf \neq 0.  Less widely known is
that if ker(g) \inc im(f), then it is also exact.  That is actually if and
only if.  That is, if either of K = ker(f) and I = im(f) contains the
other, they are equal.  Well, I got to wondering about that and eventually
conjectured and proved that it is always the case that I/(I\cap K) is
isomorphic to K/(I\cap K).  This makes it transparent that if either
contains the other, they have to be equal.

There is just one point remaining.  I did this by chasing elements around
in Ab (so it is true in any abelian category).  Does anyone see a clever
proof using the snake lemma?  I don't.

Dear All

I somewhat recall that, a while ago, we discussed the origins of
the notions of category and functor. S. Mac Lane had once pointed
out to me these origins but from my recollections we did not
entirely reproduce them.

In his paper

Samuel Eilenberg and Categories, JPAA 168 (2002), 127-131

Saunders Mac Lane clearly pointed out the origins:

"Category" from Kant (which I had known all the time)

"Functor" from Carnap's book "Logical Syntax of Language" (which I
had forgotten).


Also I have a question, not directly related to the above issue:

I have seen, on some web page, a copy of
the referee's report about the Eilenberg-Mac Lane paper
where Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces are introduced.
I cannot find this web page (or the report)
any more. Can anyone provide me with
a hint where I can possibly find it?

Many thanks in advance

Johannes

There is another curiosity about the axioms for a category, namely the
infuence of the known axioms for a groupoid (Brandt, 1926). Bill Cockcroft
told me that these axioms had influenced E-M. These axioms were well used in
the algebra group at Chicago.  However when I asked Sammy about this in 1985
he firmly said `no, and was why the notion of groupoid did not appear as an
example in the E-M paper'!

Perhaps it was a case of forgetting the influence?

I certainly heard Saunders mention Brandt groupoids as examples.
(Not very good examples, since all maps are invertible.)  But, as
everyone knows, it is not the definition of a category that
is the key part, but seeing that functors and natural
transformations are interesting.

Interesting speculation, but how can we verify or refute it?  What I can
add is that when I sat in on Sammy's category theory course (called
homological algebra, but I am not sure Ext or Tor were ever mentioned), I
do not recall that he so much as mentioned groupoids.  I once mentioned to
Charles Ehresmann that he appeared to view categories as a generalization
of groupoids while Eilenberg and Mac Lane thought of them as a
generalization of posets.  Charles agreed.

This reminds me of a speculation I have often had (although Saunders
denied and he knew Birkhoff pretty well).  In the 30s and 40s, the word
"homomorphism" was regularly used but always meant surjective.  By the
late 40s and 50s people were talking about "homomorphism into" meaning not
necessarily surjective.  So groups had lattices of subgroups and lattices
of quotient groups and Birkhoff invented lattice theory at least partly in
the hope that the structure of those two lattices would tell you a lot
about the structure of the group.  I don't think this actually happened to
any great extent.  But I have wondered whether Birkhoff might instead have
invented categories had our more general notion of homomorphism been
rampant.  As I said Saunders didn't think so, but it still sounds
attractive to me.

One of the things that astonishes me about "General theory of natural
equivalences" is that they clearly knew about natural transformations in
general but chose to talk only about equivalences.  I once asked Sammy
about that and he more or less said something like one generalization at a
time.  But they must have realized that the Hurevic map is a superior
example.  Still, Steenrod must have gotten the point immediately.

There is another aspect to the E-M achievement that I stressed in my
CT06 talk for the Eilenberg - Mac Lane Session at White Point. Given the
extent to which 20th-century mathematics was entrenched in set theory,
it was a tremendous psychological step to put structure on "classes" and
to dare regarding these (perceived) monsters as objects that one could
study just as one would study individual groups or topological spaces.
In my experience, skepticism towards category theory is often rooted in
the fear of the "illegitimately large" size, till today. By comparison,
Brandt groupoids lived in the cozy and familiar small world, and their
definition was arrived at without having to leave the universe. With the
definition of category (and functor and natural transformation)
Eilenberg and Moore had to do a lot more than just repeating at the
monoid level what Brandt did at the group level! In my view their big
psychological step here is comparable to Cantor's daring to think that
there could be different levels of infinity.

Cheers,
Walter.

There are no

Indeed on 8/17, 8/26, and 8/27  I urged the continuation of the development
of Chen's theory (for example the smooth space of piecewise smooth paths),
making use of recent experience of the range of possible categories.


It is possible that

	 > for differential geometry with infinitesimals.

But a proof would require a definition of what is meant by infinitesimals,
as well as the constraint on the framework that the maps 1->R and R->R
are the standard ones. Otherwise nonstandard analysis might fit.
The nilpotents or germs capture the Heraclitian nature of motion in a way
that abstract sets do not directly.


The misplaced concreteness, according to which

          >spaces are [single] sets equipped with extra structure

is only a "second aspect of the default paradigm. The first aspect,
successfully overcome by the named pioneers, is the one generalizing the
default category of topological spaces (or locales). Here "default" refers
to the habitual response to the frequently occurring need to specify a
background category of cohesion in which to interpret our algebra.
The generalization from Sierpinski-valued functions (open sets) to
real-valued, has also been proposed, but that sort of
attempt never succeeded in yielding a simple theory of map spaces.
In contrast to this "function-algebra X/R as primary" paradigm,
the semi-dual "figure-geometry S/X as primary" has led to good map
spaces (including internal function algebras) for many authors
(Sebastiao e Silva, Fox, Hurewicz 60 years ago and several more recent).
I believe that attempting to force nearly-perfect duality has in general
not led to good results, but of course one studies the extent to which
a monad (presumed identity on models S) approximates the identity on
general spaces. For example, Froelicher=E2=80=99s duality condition applies not
only to the line R but to the function space R^R, a non-trivial fact about
the smooth case, derived by LSZ from a study of distributions of compact
support (so citing it is not just name-dropping).

Noether's `set theoretic foundations of group theory', where group
axioms are based on a notion of coset decomposition rather than
multiplication, seems to be much earlier (20s) attempt to the same:

But they must have realized that the Hurevic map is a superior

In my experience, skepticism towards category theory is often rooted in

In my experience, disdain for cat theory is due to papers with a very

Hi all,

Given an indexing 2-category J, a pair of parallel functors
F,G : J ----> CAT, and a natural equivalence  f : F ==> G,
the pseudo-limits of F and G should be equivalent.

I am trying to find out what paper, if any, I can cite for this theorem.  Or
maybe this is just the type of thing that nobody has bothered to write down.
Any help would be appreciated.

best,
Alex Hoffnung

The chosen example is not too convincing,=20
since the notions involved are not typically categorical.
Complicated sentences like this can be found in every fields.
They are often the mark of a poor paper.

My guess is that the disdain for categories has a mixed origin.
Like logic, category theory has a taste for generalities.
But most mathematicians are specialised and they find
it hard to believe that important progresses can be made in their fields
from the outside, as the result of general insights.
But we all know that the division of mathematics into fields=20
is justified more by sociology than by science.=20
Category theory is a powerful tool for crossing=20
the boundaries between the fields.
The unity of mathematics is growing stronger every day.

Indeed, the notion of natural isomorphism (or canonical isomorphism)
should be available already to groupoid theorists before 1945.
To what extent did they know about functors and natural isomorphisms,
and to what extent did Saunders & Mac Lane have to tell them?
Or, pace Walter's remarks, did they know about the ~small~ ones
but not have the guts to apply them to large classes of strucures?

It's been said before that the real insight of category theory
--as something more general than groupoids, monoids, and posets--
is the notion of adjoint functors (including limits, etc).
I'm inclined to agree, so I'm interested in why and whether
groupoid theorists thought of (and applied) that which they ~did~ have.

Indeed, the quote I was misremembering was NOT in category theory
how's that for crossing the boundaries between the fields. ;-)
in fact, it turns out that the correct usage is
hemi-demi-semi-quaver - in music!

Hi Alex,

This property is certainly known to hold for a much larger class of
2-categorical limits - the flexible limits, which class includes the classes
of pseudo, lax and op-lax limits. I believe you will find a proof of this
result in the Bird, Kelly, Power and Street paper entitled "Flexible Limits
for 2-Categories". Failing that the Power and Robinson paper "A
characterisation of PIE limits" probably contains this result is some form.

You can also find explications of the pseudo and lax results in earlier
works by Street, although obvious candidates for the best one to consult
elude me at the moment.

The most elementary proof of the flexible limit result starts by observing
that all flexible limits can be constructed using products, splittings of
idempotents and a couple of less familiar, exclusively 2-categorical, limits
called inserters and equifiers. It is then straight forward to verify the
result you mention for each of these particular limits and then to infer
that it must therefore hold for all flexible limits.

In the early 1990's Robert Pare introduced a class of limits called the
persistent limits. These were defined for 2-categories, but made use of his
double categorical approach to 2-limits. Persistent limits are precisely
those limits which have the stability property you seek, but with regard to
a slightly more general class of double categorical diagram transformations
whose 1-cellular components are all equivalences.

In my thesis (1992), I prove that the class of flexible limits introduced by
Bird, Kelly, Power and Street is identical to Pare's class of persistent
limits - thus closing the circle and demonstrating that the flexible limits
are in a natural sense the largest class of 2-limits which have this
property.

Dear All,

I agree with Andre that part of the matter is sociological. It is also quite
fundamental, and is about the proper aims of mathematics. The need is for
discussion, rather than total agreement.

Miles Reid's infamous comment was "The study of category theory  for its own
sake (surely one of the most sterile of intellectual  pursuits) also
dates from this time; Grothendieck can't necessarily be  blamed
for this, [!!!] since his own use of categories was very successful in
solving problems. "  (My riposte in a paper was to suggest a game: `I can
think of a more intellectually sterile pursuit than you can!') This suggests
the view
that solving problems, presumably already formulated ones,  is the key part
of mathematics. (Miles did tell me he expected his student to use topoi or
whatever!)  A 1974 report on graduate mathematicians in employment suggested
they were good at solving problems but not so good at formulating them.

Grothendieck in one letter to me wrote on his aim for
`understanding'. (see my article on `Promoting Mathematics' on my
Popularisation web page) I believe many students come into mathematics
because they like finding out why things are true, they want to understand.
Loday told me he thought one of the strengths of French mathematics was to
try to realise this aim. By contrast, I  once
asked Frank Adams why he wrote that  a certain nonabelian cohomology was
trivial and he said `you just do a calculation' - Frank was a determined
problem solver!

So people have asked: "Where are the big theorems, the big problems,  in
category theory?" Are they there? Does it matter if they are not there?

Atiyah in his article on `20th century mathematics' (Bull LMS, 2001) talks
about the unity of mathematics, but the word `category' does not occur in
his
article. (Neither does groupoid.) He states a dichotomy between geometry
(good)and algebra (bad) but fails to recognise the combination given by,
say, Grothendieck's work, and also by higher categorical structures.
Indeed, underlying structures and processes may be of various types, all
very useful to know. I am *very* impressed by Henry Whitehead's finding so
many of these.

A word often omitted in mathematics teaching is `analogy'. Yet this is what
abstraction is about, and why it is so powerful. Category theory allows for
powerful analogies.

I am always puzzled, even horrified,  by mathematicians who use the word
`nonsense' to describe the work of others (as is all too common), yet often
themselves cannot well define professionalism in the subject. Indeed they
often cannot believe the direction others may take is chosen for good
professional reasons! They sometimes say `not mainstream'. Yet history shows
`the mainstream' shifts its course radically over the years. The lack is of
a consistent and well maintained mathematical criticism, recognising
historical trends and not just the `great man (or woman)', or famous
problem,  approach.

I believe we need to have prepared an answer to: What has category theory
done for mathematics? And indeed for evaluation of any subject areas. But a
good case is that category theory leads, or can lead,  and has led, to
clarity, to understanding and development of the rich variety of structures
there are and to be found.  However this does not rate for million $ prizes
(as it should, of course!).

When I see all the current fuss (rightly) about the LHC in Geneva, I do
wonder: who is going to speak up for mathematics, to attract students into
the subject, by getting over a message as to its value and achievements? and
also getting this message over to students studying the subject! (see
`Promoting Mathematics' and  Tim and my article on `the methodology of
mathematics')

In the case singled out by Alex a rather direct proof can
also be given. Let Psd denote the 2-category of 2-functors,
pseudonatural transformations and modifications P -> Cat. The
pseudolimit of a 2-functor F: P -> Cat may be identified with
the hom-category Psd(1,F); and accordingly we have a
pseudolimit 2-functor lim = Psd(1,-): Psd -> Cat, which sends
pseudonatural equivalences F =~ G to equivalences of
categories lim(F) =~ lim(G). The corresponding result for
pseudolimits in other 2-categories now follows by the
Cat-enriched Yoneda lemma.

Here is some up-lifting press about categories that I saw in an article
by Karl  Heinrich Hofmann entitled "Bourbaki in T"ubingen und in den
USA, Erinnerungen an die franz"osische Revolution in der Mathematik",
which may translate as "Bourbaki in Tubingen and in the USA,
reminiscenses of the French revolution in mathematics", and which
appeared in the "Mitteilungen der DMV" (the German equivalent of the AMS
Notices, which is distributed to all members), vol 16.2 (2008),
pp128-136. While the author has a lot of praise for Bourbaki's work, he
lists also a number of "defects of the Bourbaki concept", and the
following appears quite prominently in his article (my translation,
okayed by the author):

"Since Bourbaki is considered as the exponent of the theory of
mathematical structures, it is truly surprising that the theory of
categories (S. Eilenberg and S. Mac Lane, 1946) was almost demonstrably
ignored as the mother of all structure theories. This was hardly
sustainable in commutative algebra anymore, and the discord between
Grothendieck and Bourbaki may well have been rooted in this rejection.
This dismissive position is even more surprising since Eilenberg as one
of the few non-French people belonged to the early Bourbaki group, and
since the French founder of category theory, Charles Ehresmann, was at
times closely connected with Bourbaki. In my view this failure of
Bourbaki is grave."

this is about the recent thread  "categories and functors" and "disdain
for categories"

Ten points:

1) It seems clear that E-M arrived to categories and functors by
abstraction from the usual large categories of sets, groups, boolean
algebras, modules, etc etc

2) It seems (less clearly) that Ehresman arrived to categories and
functors by generalization from groupoids and morphisms of groupoids.

3) I agree with  "It's been said before that the real insight of
category theory
--as something more general than groupoids, monoids, and posets--
is the notion of adjoint functors (including limits, etc)."

Concerning this, I think that real breakthrough made by categories is
the simple fact that they furnish the appropriate abstract structure to
define the Bourbaki's  concept of universal property. The fact that the
singleton set is characterized by being a terminal object opens the way
to characterize thousands of objects and constructions by being the
terminal object in the appropriate category. Yoneda's lemma is the
milestone. Everything is due to it.

4) I think the small-large business played no role at all in the rise of
the concept of categories, neither in the rise of the disdain to them by
many mathematicians.

 5) "working" mathematicians were never afraid about paradoxes. In
consequence, I think that phrases as "dare regarding these (perceived)
monsters ...",   "fear of the "illegitimately large" size", etc etc,
are  misleading and out of place.

6) Cantor did not  "dare  to think that there could be different levels
of infinity", he discovered that they were different levels of infinity,
and proceed to study this phenomena. This was not a bold action, he was
just fascinated by the existence of different levels of infinity. He was
not afraid of paradoxes either, he was very well aware of Russell
paradox, but for him it  was just another theorem.

7) It is often repeated that axiomatic set theory arise in order to
eliminate paradoxes. False, axiomatic set theory arise in an attempt to
understand Von Neumann accumulation process:  Which were the axioms
satisfied by the output of that process ?  Answer: axiomatic set theory.

8) "In my experience, disdain for cat theory is due to papers with a very
high density of unfamiliar names", I agree with this in the sense that
this fact contributed to the rise of the disdain, but not as the single
reason. I agree also with "Complicated sentences like this can be found
in every fields. They are often the mark of a poor paper".

It follows there must be other reasons (besides  the abundance of poor
papers in category theory, a fact that I found true) to explain the disdain.

9) A profound reason could be an instinctive opposition  to real change
in many people.  The instinctive reaction against progress that may
disrupt their own comfortable position.

10) The so self proclaimed "problem solvers" who disdain abstract
theories often do not resolve any real problem. The just do "concrete
nonsense". People who really solve true problems usually have a great
respect for abstract theories.  Of course, they are also many who just
do "abstract nonsense" instead of contribute to the meaningful
development of theories.

Dear all,

In ``basic concepts of enriched category theory'',
Kelly writes:

> Since the cone-type limits have no special position of
> dominancein the general case, we go so far as to call
> weighted limits simply ``limits'', where confusion
> seems unlikely.

My question is this: why does he not apply the same
principle to the concept of powers?  Instead, he
introduces the word ``cotensor'', apparently in order
to reserve the word ``power'' for that special case
which could sensibly be called ``discrete power''.
[This leads to the unfortunate scenario that a
``cotensor'' is a sort of limit, while dually a
``tensor'' is a sort of colimit.]  Is there perhaps
some genuinely mathematical objection to calling
cotensors powers (and tensors copowers) which I may
have overlooked?

Cheers,
Jeff.

P.S. I specify ``genuinely mathematical'' because I
know that some people are opposed to any change of
terminology for any reason whatsoever.  Obviously,
I disagree; in particular, I don't see that minor
terminological schisms such as monad/triple (even
compact/rigid/autonomous) are in any way detrimental
to the subject.

I also disagree with the notion (symptomatic of the
curiously feudal mentality which seems to permeate the
mathematical community) that prestigious mathematicians
have more right to set terminology than the rest of us.
I see no correlation between mathematical talent and
good terminology; nor do I understand that a great
mathematician can be ``dishonoured'' by anything less
than strict adherence to their terminology---or notation,
for that matter.

I can not recall where, but I read more than once more detailed descriptions
on
what Bourbaki did not accept from Grothendieck. The conservativeness
of Bourbaki who did not accept the usage of category theory (not only
"neglect")
and non-acceptance of a very general approach of Grothendieck to the
notion of "manifold" he envisioned for the future Bourbaki works
were some of the
main points of departure. The remark that as a proponent of "structures"
Bourbaki
had to include categories is anyway a bit lacking an argument. First of all,
because
of the size problems one can not take big categories on equal footing with,
say groups,
and considering only small categories would be strange and lacking most
interesting
examples. On the other hand, Grothendieck judged the lack stemming in
conservativeness
rather than in consistency of the structure-oriented style. Indeed,
according to Dieudonne,
Bourbaki felt comfortable only in including to the books already
(meta)stable, "dead" mathematics
and not the structures in the unstable "living" phase of development.
This was the intended scope and self-conscious (according to Dieudonne)
limitation of the work.
One can accept this and still cry for an exception for so economic tool
as the category theory (if taken in conservative and very basic sense),
especially
in the vision of the wish for generality, Bourbaki followed otherwise.

For those who like compliments: the triples website has had (for a
while now) a link to a lecture by Voevodsky given at the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences in October 2002, in which he describes
"categories [as] one of the most important ideas of 20th century
mathematics".  The video of the talk may be found at

   http://claymath.msri.org/voevodsky2002.mov

(the compliment isn't the only reason for watching!).

And there are a few other categorical links on our site at

Suggestions are always welcome.

Thank you to Paul for remembering my talk at Amiens. It was certainly

It is a terrific lecture.  The line "I think that at the heart of 20th
century mathematics lies one particular notion and that is the notion
of a category" occurs at minute 16.

Dear Colleagues,

I think the first things to say about "Bourbaki and Categories" are:

(a) It is very obvious that the invention of category theory was by far the
greatest discovery of 20th century mathematics.

(b) Bourbaki Tractate is another great event, of a very different kind of
course, which will be a treasure for the Historians of next centuries. It
shows how the members of a very leading group of a leading mathematical
country were thinking in the middle of the same century (well, up to their
internal disagreements; after all, Eilenberg and Grothendieck were also
there at some point...).

(c) Accordingly, Bourbaki Tractate is the best evidence showing how hard it
was to understand (even and especially for such brilliant mathematicians!)
that there is something even better that Cantor paradise.

(d) Defining structures, Bourbaki makes very clear that morphisms are
important (and some form of universal properties are important). But
morphisms are NOT defined in general: it is simply a class of maps between
structures of a given type closed under composition and having isomorphisms
(which ARE defined) as its invertible members. And... every interested
student will ask: if so, why not defining a category?

Let me also add what is less important but still comes to my mind:

(e) Bourbaki approach to structures has a hidden very primitive form of what
was later discovered by topos theorists: in order to define a structure they
need a 'scales of sets', which is build using finite products and power sets
(no unions and no colimits of any kind!).

(f) According to Walter Tholen's message, Karl Heinrich Hofmann says: "...it
is truly surprising that the theory of categories (S. Eilenberg and S. Mac
Lane, 1946) was almost demonstrably
ignored as the mother of all structure theories. This was hardly sustainable
in commutative algebra anymore...". Very true (except 1946), but it is
much-much-much worse in homological algebra, where the absence of categories
and functors (having a section called "Functoriality" though) in Bourbaki's
presentation is most amazing.

(g) A few days ago Tom Leinster has explained to us that "disinformation is
*deliberate* false information, false information *intended* to mislead".
Fine, but sometimes false information is created by ignorance so badly, that
it sounds right to call it disinformation (Don't you agree, Tom?). And...
look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbaki : There is a section called
"Criticism of the Bourbaki perspective", which, among other things, says:
"The following is a list of some of the criticisms commonly made of the
Bourbaki approach:^[13]..." (where [13] is a book of Pierre Cartier; I have
not seen that book, and so I am not making any conclusions about it). The
list has seven items with no category theory in it!

Dear All,

The importance of Bourbaki should be stessed, as it was started when, so =
we=20
are told, texts were very bad. There are many beautiful things in the boo=
ks:=20
I developed part of an undergraduate course from the account of the=20
classification of closed subgroups of R^n. This relates to old questions =
on=20
orbits of the planets, and also gives some nice exercises and even exam=20
questions of a calculation type. It is good to present students with a=20
classification theorem.

The difficulties for Bourbaki seem to arise from the presentation (a) as =
a=20
final and definitive view in toto, and (b) without enough context, as And=
re=20
points out.

On (a), there is the old childish joke: what happens if you put worms in =
a=20
straight line from Marble Arch to Picadilly Circus? One of them would be=20
bound to wriggle and spoil it all! So some mathematical worms have not on=
ly=20
wriggled but grown large and marched off in a different direction.

On (b), there is the old debating society tag:
text without context is merely pretext.
See more questions in Tim and my article on `Mathematics in Context'.

What is wrong is to present, or take, the whole account as totally=20
authoritative, and  will last indefinitely.

What Bourbaki also shows is the value for at least the writers of taking =
a=20
viewpoint and following it through as far as it will go: if it seems in t=
he=20
end to go too far, or to be inadequate, then that is valuable information=
=20
for them and others. See my Dirac quote in `Out of Line'.

Dear Colleagues,

I would like to make a remark concerning my CT2008 talk.

First let me recall: A lot of mathematics (e.g. of Galois theory) can be
done in the context of adjoint functors between abstract categories with
finite limits - and since one gets all finite limits our of finite products
and equalizers, one can try a further generalization with monoidal structure
plus equalizers. The point was that this seemingly primitive old idea
actually works very seriously and should be taken as the idea of developing
non-cartesian categorical algebra. And "non-cartesian" is the right idea of
"non-commutative" and "quantum", although what Ross Street means by
"quantum" is more involved and also important. In particular non-cartesian
internal categories are to be taken seriously.

At the end of my talk Jeff Egger told us that he knows someone studied such
generalized internal categories, and later sent me an email with the name:
Marcelo Aguiar; and gave the home page address
http://www.math.tamu.edu/~maguiar/ , and... I realized that it is the third
time I am informed about this work! Recently (winter 2007) I spend two very
nice months in Warsaw invited by Piotr Hajac, and discussing mathematics
with him, Tomasz Brzezinski, Tomasz Maszczyk, and a few others - and, among
other interesting things, Tomasz Brzezinski showed me Marcelo Aguiar's
website, including PhD, where those generalized internal categories were
studied. I also recall now an email message from Steven Chase (from 2002)
where he mentions "...the notion of a category internal to a monoidal
category which was developed by my former doctoral student, Marcelo Aguiar,
in his thesis, "Internal Categories and Quantum Groups" (available on
line...".

In fact the whole story begins, in some sense, with the book [S. U. Chase
and M. E. Sweedler, Hopf algebras and Galois theory, Lecture Notes in
Mathematics 97, Springer 1969], which does not use monoidal categories yet,
but very clearly shows that the commutative case is much easier (for Galois
theory) because it makes tensor product (of algebras) (co)cartesian. There
are many other important further contributions by other authors of different
generations. Knowing them personally, I can name Bodo Pareigis, Stefaan
Caenepeel, Peter Schauenburg, and the aforementioned Polish mathematicians
(although Tomasz Brzezinski is in UK now), but I am not ready to give any
reasonably complete list. There are also things-to-be-corrected happening:
for instance by far not enough comparisons have been made with the
Australian work on abstract monoidal categories, and some authors use words
like "coring"...

I think that as a 'proponent of "structures"' Bourbaki had NOT include
categories - and not only because of the size problem. A more fundamental
reason seems me to be this. Structures are things determined up to isomor=
phism;
in the structuralist mathematics the notion of isomorphism is basic and t=
he
notion of general morphism is derived (as in Bourbaki).  In CT this is th=
e
other way round: the notion of general morphism is basic while isos are d=
efined
through a specific property (of reversibility).
This is why the inclusion of CT would require a revision of fundamentals =
of
Bourbaki's structuralist thinking. Although CT for obvious historical rea=

is closely related to structuralist mathematics it is not, in my understa=

a part of structuralist mathematics - at least not if one takes CT *serio=

i.e. as foundations.

Andre Joyal's message was inspiring.  I think a new Bourbaki type of
effort (this time with motivation and category theory) is called for.  I
would like a text on categorical algebra oriented toward those who have
studied algebra and know enough category theory to use adjunctions, monad=
s
and the like.  The same goes for categorical logic and model theory.

I read Andre's closing remarks as a commentary on the emerging crisis in
overcoming misconceptions about and outright hostility toward science and
mathemtics.  I have a current project, using my own meager funds and time=
,
to advance science teaching using a book available through the National
Academies Press, "Science, Evolution, and Creationism".  From the title, =
I
think you can see my motivation.

In a similar (although less aprocryphal) vein, when I worked with compute=
r
scientists and applied mathematicians in industry ( and also when I've
submitted papers to certain neural network journals) I encountered
misconceptions about and outright hostility toward category theory.  For
example, in the dynamic systems community there seems to be a widespread
myth that "category theory was tried and failed".  I have followed this u=
p
to some extent and haven't found any basis for it.  I am often told that
the best way to counter skepticism is with a working application.

Having tried that, and tried again, I've come to the conclusion that Yes,
you need applications, but applications cannot by themselves counter a
refusal to give a theory credit for being consistent with the data.  You
need a good, clear presentation of the theory couched in a language
oriented toward the intended audience.  As with biology teaching that
shows clearly the importance of the theory of evolution, maybe mathematic=
s
teaching that incorporates category theory needs to begin in 6th Grade (i=
n
schools in the USA) if not sooner.  Maybe a new Bourbaki project could
have an extension into this level of instruction.

Best Regards,
Mike

  Dear all,

I would add some information on Bourbaki/categories/France.
Charles Ehresmann has been an active member of Bourbaki from 1936 up =20
to the end of the war, when he began to no more regularly participate =20
and wanted to resign (it was not accepted but replaced by an age limit =20
for active participation).
What Andre says:

    >Bourbaki had essentially two options: rewrite the whole treaty using
    > categories, or just introduce them in the book on homological algebra,
    >The second option won, essentially because of the enormity of the task
    > of rewriting everything.

is more easily understood if we take into account that communication =20
between France and the USA were entirely broken during the war, so =20
that mathematical ideas could not circulate and categories were only =20
heard of after the war, at a time where the more general parts of the =20
treatise were written or at least prepared (the successive versions =20
process was very slow).
     Charles said to me that he did not recall to have read Eilenberg =20
& Mac Lane's paper before the fifties, or at least not seen its =20
interest. Naturally he had sooner made a large use of groupoids in is =20
foundation of differential geometry, and he had even defined the =20
general "composition of jets" and given its properties, but without =20
linking it to the notion of a category. He exposed it in a course in =20
Rio de Janeiro in the early fifties, and one of his students =20
(Constantino de Barros who later came to Paris to prepare a thesis =20
with him) suggested that there was a connection with categories. =20
Charles' first large use of categories is in his seminal paper =20
"Gattungen von lokalen Strukturen" (1957, reprinted in "Charles =20
Ehresmann: Oeuvres completes et commentees" Part I).
    It is around this date that the word "category" began to circulate =20
in France.  In 1957, Choquet  (with whom I prepared my thesis) =20
suggested that I learnt more on the notion of category which he did =20
not know but seemed to have many applications (it was the reason for =20
which I first went to see Charles!). It should be noted that Choquet =20
was less conservative than many French mathematicians. In 1959, he =20
defended the development of probabilities by inviting Loomis to give a =20
course (I remember Henri Cartan saying then to Paul-Andre Meyer that =20
he should not study this domain for it would be bad for his career!). =20
And later on, he defended Logic which was very badly considered.
    A final remark: the "disdain" for categories (not to be confused =20
with 'ignorance') came only later on, since Charles was given the =20
"Prix Petit d'Ormoy" by the French Academy in 1965, essentially for =20
his recent work on categories...

I don't know about this.  I took several courses in the late 1950s that
seem to have been influenced by the structuralist ideas (certainly
categories weren't mentioned; I never heard the word until Dave Harrison
arrived in 1959) and each of them started by defining an appropriate
notion of "admissible map".  I do not recall any special point being made
of isomorphism and I think in general it was used for what we now call a
bimorphism (1-1 and onto) even in cases, such as topological groups, when
they were not isomorphisms.

To be sure Bourbaki was not mentioned either, but this structuralist
influence seemed strong.

I hope the following information can be of help here:
Indeed, Marcello Aguilar gave a definition of `internal categories'.
Although the abstract definition of a `coring' looks formally the same
as the one of an internal category (or, if you wish, an internal
cocategory), corings provide examples of these internal cocategories,
but they (usually) refer to a much more concrete situation: a coring
is a co-monoid in the monoidal category of bimodules over a given
(possibly non-commutative) ring, this dualizes usual ring extensions.
The theory of corings is in fact quite young, and grew from a pure
algebraic theory to something more and more categorical in the last
few years (this might cause some confusion, `internal corings', which
can be defined in certain monoidal categories (the regular ones from
aguilar) or bicategories, are indeed the same objects as internal
cocategories, there is no need for two names for the same thing at
this level of generality). Therefore, I find the above remark ``not
enough comparision have been made ...'' indeed correct: I believe that
people from corings can learn from more from the pure category theory
side, and hopefully the other way around as well.

Best wishes,
Joost.

i think that we should try to heed andre joyal's call for action. he calls
for a new collaborative effort a la bourbaki, this time based on
categories from the outset.

it is true that very ambitious efforts usually fail, and this would be an
extremely ambitious one. moreover, taking action sounds like something
people used to do in 20th century, and not in these times of fox news and
smooth crowd control.

but there are two points that make me think that andre's call is
different:

1) he is pointing to the reasons for action, that are slowly but surely
catching up with every scientist, no matter how much we try to ignore
them.

2) he is suggesting a medium (web, internet) that may make a difference
between... well between being able to make a difference and not being able
to make a difference.

ad (2), i would like to add that the web tools facilitate in a substantial
way not only dissemination, but also collaboration. there are methods to
support more efficient knowledge aggregation from a broader base than ever
before. developing a suitable collaboration process may be hard (at least
as hard as developing a suitable voting procedure), but it may be worth
while. eg, the wikipedia process can be criticized from many angles; but
wikipedia has the amazing property that it is an *evolutionary* knowledge
repository, which can easily correct any observed shortcomings, and
recover from any misinterpretations, almost like science itself.

at the moment, the wikipedia process is probably not optimal for
presenting subtle or many faceted concepts, and the discussions of
everyone with everyone else are not the most productive way. that is
perhaps why most of us (with some very honorable exceptions!) have been
staying away from it. but an improved process, combining the integrity,
and perhaps the structure of the categories@mta community with the
available wiki-methods may bring categorical methods into a dynamic
environment, perhaps more natural for them than books and papers.

just my 2c,
-- dusko

PS like an unwanted pop song, the name Nicolas Bourwiki just emerged in my
head! can someone please propose a worse one, or i am stuck. oh, i
already have a worse one...

I agree with Andre.  Encapsulating a group of mathematicians inside a =20=

single named entity fosters a kind of collaborative spirit in which =20
good ideas are not kept for personal use later but are shared amongst =20=

the community.  When ideas are shared in real time, good mathematics =20
can be produced faster.  Anyone who wants to join the collective can =20
do so, and the collective produces highly useful material.  Of course =20=

such an enterprise is orthogonal to name-recognition, and maybe to =20
getting tenure!  But there is certainly something good about it, as =20
there is about wikipedia and the open source movement.

I also agree that the internet could be used in a better way to =20
transfer knowledge of mathematics.  Math papers are written linearly, =20=

in the bottom-up (Euclid/Bourbaki) style, to some extent.  Whereas =20
words on paper are in this sense one-dimensional, computers offer =20
many more dimensions for knowledge transfer.

Even more interesting to me would be a kind of zoom-feature on =20
proofs.  Proofs are in the eye of the beholder: for example it has =20
been debated as to whether Perelman's 70 pages was a full proof of =20
geometrization.  Given a proof with a statement which one does not =20
understand, a mathematician may find himself reproving something that =20=

was obvious to (or wrongly assumed to be obvious by) another =20
mathematician.  The community could benefit if a mathematician who =20
proves such a statement then uploaded the proof, even in rough form, =20
to some kind of math wiki.  If it were well-organized, this math wiki =20=

could revolutionize how mathematics is done.  In fact, choosing the =20
"right way" to organize such a site may itself be a problem which =20
could produce interesting mathematics.

Whatever the case may be, I am all for the idea of a new Bourbaki-=20
style enterprise in some form or another.  I think it may first =20
require interested parties to get together at some physical location.

Dear Jeff,

I had a chat about this with a couple of other long-time users of the
terms tensor and cotensor (Ross Street and Dominic Verity). We
all think that, given the current overburdening of the word tensor,
this would be a sensible change.

Regards,

Steve Lack.

Dear Andree,

Could you please explain this better?:

The only Bourbaki member I new personally was Sammy Eilenberg. As many of
us, I knew him very well and I would say that he was more skeptical about
the Bourbaki Tractate then one can conclude from Andre's message. Having in
mind not just this but the content of Bourbaki's "Homological algebra" and
what we see today from the followers of that Bourbaki group, I protest
against Andre's "two options" and I insist that Bourbaki group simply did
not see the importance of category theory (in spite of being brilliant
mathematicians, as I said in my previous message). I hope Andre will forgive
me and even agree with me.

However, there were three great category-theorists in that group (plus there
is this mysterious story about Chevalley's book of category theory lost in
the train), and "did not see" cannot be said about them of course. On the
other hand I have never heard of any joint work of Charles Ehresmann with
any of the two others, Eilenberg and Grothendieck (and nothing jointly from
them). I think apart from the time issues you describe, the relationship
between Bourbaki Tractate and category theory should have been determined by
their separate or joint influence and therefore also by their communication
with each other (if any).

Is this true, and could you please give details?

Respectfully, and with best regards-

George

Dear friends,

the usual kind of wiki is not suitable for collaborative science, but
recently there has been news of a special wiki for scientists which has
good support for references, keeps track of who said what, and has a
rating system. You can read more about it in Nature Genetics here

http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v40/n9/full/ng.f.217.html

and see it working here: http://www.wikigenes.org/

They even have movies for those who are too lazy to click:

http://www.wikigenes.org/app/info/movie.html

It looks however that they are not offering the software that runs the
whole thing.

The next Bourbaki, if there is going to be one, should not only advance
one particular kind of knowledge, but also show everyone that linearly
written text is not the only option.

My opinion is that we have not yet found the right way to do
"hive-science", but when we do, it will be a revolution. (A good start
would be to get out of the hold that the evil publishers have on us.)

Best regards,

Andrej

Bourbaki redone as Bourwiki (thanks, Dusko!) with the benefit of
category theoretic insights will hopefully clarify some segments of
mathematics.

What troubles me in this discussion however is its assumed scope of
"some."  I get the sense that there are people who want it to be
mandated as "all."

Perhaps it should be.

Just now I looked through an issue of American Mathematical Monthly that
came to hand to get a sense of the likely alignment of Bourwiki with
what the mathematical community generally regards as the scope of its
subject.  Actually I do this periodically, and I don't see much change
between the issue I picked up just now and any of the other issues I've
looked at in the past with just this question in mind.

If the subject Bourwiki is proposing to serve is mathematics, then
perhaps it is time that the American Mathematical Monthly, along with
the Putnam Mathematical Competition, the International Mathematics
Olympiad, and the Journal of the AMS, abandon their pretense of being
about mathematics and come up with a suitable name for their subject.
Not only do categories, functors, natural transformations, adjunctions,
and monads go unused in these 20th century icons of mathematics, they go
unacknowledged.  Clearly they have not gotten with the modern
mathematical program and fall somewhere between a throwback to a golden
age and a backwater of mathematics.  When they die off like the
dinosaurs they are, real mathematics will be able to advance unfettered
into the 21st century and beyond.

Judging from the talks at BLAST in Denver last month (B = Boolean
algebras, L = lattices, A = (universal) algebra, S = set theory, T =
topology), at least the algebraic community is moving very slightly in
this direction.  Things will hopefully improve yet further when
algebraic geometry gets over its snit with equational model theory.

Meanwhile if you need a witness for seven degrees of separation, look no
further than AMM and CT.

(I confess to being an unreconstructed graph theorist and algebraist
myself.  I may have to preemptively volunteer myself for re-education
before it becomes involuntary.)

When one defines, say, a group =E0 la Borbaki, i.e. structurally, it usua=
lly goes
without saying that the defined structure is defined up to isomorphism. T=
he
notion of isomorphism plays in this case the role similar to that of equa=
lity
in the (naive) arithmetic. In most structural constexts the distinction b=
etween
the "same" structure and isomorphic structures is mathematically trivial =
just
like the distinction between the "same" number and equal numbers. It may =
be not
specially discussed in this case exactly because it is very basic. The no=
tion
of admissible map, say, that of group homomorphism, on the contrary, requ=
ires a
definition, which may be non-trivial.
The idea to do mathematics up to isomorphism is not Bourbaki's invention;=
 it
goes back at least to Hilbert's "Grundlagen der Geometrie" of 1899. In th=
is
sense the modern axiomatic method is structuralist. In his often-quoted l=
etter
to Frege Hilbert explicitely says that a theory is "merely a framework" w=
hile
domains of their objects are multiple and transform into each other by
"univocal and reversible one-one transformations". Those who trace the hi=
story
of mathematical structuralism back to Hilbert are quite right, in my view=
.
I have in mind two issues related to CT, which suggest that CT goes in a
*different* direction - in spite of the fact that MacLane and many other
workers in CT had (and still have) structuralist motivations. The first i=
s
Functorial Semantics, which brings a *category* of models, not just one m=
odel
up to isomorphism. From the structuralist viewpoint the presence of
non-isomorphic models (i.e. non-categoricity) is a shortcoming of a given
theory. From the perspective of Functorial Semantics it is a "natural" fe=
ature
of mathematical theories to be dealt with rather than to be remedied.
The second thing I have in mind is Sketch theory. I cannot see that Hilbe=
rt's
basic structuralist intuition applies in this case. In my understanding t=
hings
work in Sketch theory more like in Euclid. Think about circle and straigh=
t line
as a sketch of the theory of the first four books of Euclid's "Elements".=
 I
would particularly appreciate, Michael, your comment on this point since =
I
learnt a lot of Sketch theory from your works.
I have also a comment about the idea to rewrite Bourbaki's "Elements" fro=
m a new
categorical viewpoint. Bourbaki took Euclid's "Elements" as a model for h=
is
work just like did Hilbert writing his "Gundlagen". In my view, this is t=
his
long-term Euclidean tradition of "working foundations", which is worth to=
 be
saved and further developed, in particular in a categorical setting. I'm =
less
sure that Bourbaki's example should be followed in a more specific sense.
Bourbaki tries to cover too much - and doesn't try to distinguish between=
 what
belongs to foundations and what doesn't. As a result the work is too long=
 and
not particularly usefull for (early) beginners. I realise that today's
mathematics unlike mathematics of Euclid's time is vast, so it is more
difficult to present its basics in a concentrated form. But consider Hilb=
ert's
"Grundlagen". It covers very little - actually near to nothing - of geome=
try of
its time. But at the same time it provided a very powerful model of how t=
o do
mathematics in a new way, which greatly influenced mathematics education =
and
mathematical research in 20th century. In my view, Euclid's "Elements" an=
d
Hilbert's "Grundlagen" are better examples to be followed.

best,
andrei

areas: lambda-calculus, type theory, realizability,
denotational semantics (games, categories, ...), linear
logic, concurrency and mobility (process algebras,
bisimilarity, semantics, ...), mathematics of programming
languages (design, typing, compilation, ...), ...

The LIMD group is a UMR (mixed CNRS-University research
unit), part of the mathematics laboratory (LAMA) at
Universit=E9 de Savoie.  The LAMA (*) has presently 27
permanent  researchers in total; the LIMD group has 3 full
Professors, 4 "Maitre de conferences" and 2 CNRS
researchers. The position is made available by the
retirement of one of the professors.


The teaching assignments are: mathematics and/or computer
science for students from L1 to M2 (in the new european

I don't know what to say about the suggestion that a circle and a line=20
make a sketch of which Euclidean plane geometry is a model.  I would thin=
k=20
you would need a point too, since intersections are crucial.  Maybe=20
complex projective geometry since then two lines intersect in one point=20
(unless they coincide), a line and a circle in two (unless they are=20
tangent or equal) and every pair of circles in four (ditto).  Maybe the=20
exceptions could be handled in some sketch.  At any rate, it wold e=20
interesting to try to sketch this in detail.  At any rate, I never though=
t=20
about this before.

Of course, you are right about a point, I missed it! I must confess I did=
n't
think about this example in precise terms. My claim is that sketch theory
doesn't fit the structuralist (Bourbaki-Hilbertian) pattern. It hardly
precisely fits the ancient Euclidean pattern either but there is a sugges=
tive
analogy, which concerns the idea that certain basic objects like point, l=
ine
and circle *generate* the rest.
A further claim is this: a specific reason *why* sketch theory doesn't fi=
t the
structuralist pattern is that in sketch theory (like in CT in general)
isomorphisms don't have the same distinguished status.

A partial solution: those who already have sufficient name recognition
should proclaim the value contributed by those without it and especially
in support of tenure for them.

Still, it might be interesting and even instructive to try to build a
sketch whose objects are (interpreted as) sets of points sets of lines,
sets of circles and intersection is an operation.  I guess incidence would
have to be a relation.  It might work.

Dear Andrei,

Sketches are not mathematical objects in their own right, in the same sense
that groups or spaces are. They are presentations (for theories), and have
status similar to other sorts of presentations (for groups, rings, etc.)

Of course that is in no way meant to suggest that they are not important and
worthy of study.

Regards,

Steve Lack.

There is an embedding theorem on which we have put Cayley's name:
if M is a monoid in a closed category then the structural coretraction
M --> [M,M] into the endohom is a nice monoid map.

A bicategorical version of this gives a nice module (distributor) A
--|--> A^{op} #A
for any (pro)monoidal V-category A. This leads to a monoidal
embedding of any
such A into the category of A-bimodules. (E.g. see Section 4 of
Pastro-St:
http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/21/4/21-04.pdf
however Brian Day also knew about these things.)

So the abstract case is not so much more abstract. I think Peter
Johnstone says
somewhere that one view of the Abelian Category Embedding Theorem is not
so much that it means we should use module-proofs to work in abelian
categories
but rather, when working in categories of modules, we might as well
work in an
abelian category. I think the same applies here for monoidal categories.
The coring people I have spoken to seem quite comfortable with
this development. Luckily we all have our own sources of motivation.

I think about a sketch as an alternative to a string of formulae, which
represents (axioms of) a theory. I didn't try to compare sketch theory wi=
th
group theory.  I tried to compare sketch theory with the general setting,=
 in
which group theory is developed a la Bourbaki (along with many other
theories). A classical account of this general setting (which differs at =
certain
points with Bourbaki's version) is Tarski's model theory.

The notion of presentation in my understanding implies that what a given
presentation is a presentation *of* is somehow given in advance. I try to=
 think
of a sketch as a means to build a theory, not to present a ready-made the=
ory.
Perhaps *representation* is a better word for it than *presentation*.

best,
andrei

There are already some pretty good categorical entries on wiki; I have
modified some of the entries on groups, actions, equivalence relations,  to
include references to groupoids, which has resulted in hits. But we should
also consider planetmath.org (entries are contributed under the terms of the
GNU Free Documentation License (FDL)) which allows for group work and is not
so open as wiki to general modification. It needs a group of you wonderful
energetic people to engage with reviewing what is on wiki and planetmath and
making sure they express what is fealt to be desirable!

In the old days, a graduate book would have an appendix on say set theory,
and maybe basic algebra, as needed for the rest of the text. It would be
very useful to have basic category theory (in terms of `the basic facts of
life') on the web available to all, with nice accounts of say `left adjoints
preserve colimits', etc. , with many convincing examples, and maybe history,
to which a text could refer. Something initially less ambitious like this
might actually get done. Being electronic, it would be  seen as a `current',
rather than `final account', and so would better reflect the way mathematics
develops, in which a slight shift of emphasis, or notation (like --> for a
function), can have profound consequences.

There is perhaps a  case for a separate collected electronic account, with
hyperref, and also a printed version, since a book is a useful portable
random access device. Print on Demand allows this to be produced quite
cheaply, with a 35% royalty on retail sales, and available on amazon.

I thank you for your message.

It is difficult to know. The Boubaki group had shielded itself

You are surely aware of the interview of Pierre Cartier=20
in the Mathematical Intelligencer No1 1998.=20
Everyone interested in the history of Bourbaki should read it.

http://ega-math.narod.ru/Bbaki/Cartier.htm

Let me stress a few passages:=20

The interview ends with the following passage.
The bold faces are from me.

Is it the time for a new Bourbaki?

Dear Andree,

Could you please explain this better?:

The only Bourbaki member I new personally was Sammy Eilenberg. As many =
of
us, I knew him very well and I would say that he was more skeptical =
about
the Bourbaki Tractate then one can conclude from Andre's message. Having =
in
mind not just this but the content of Bourbaki's "Homological algebra" =
and
what we see today from the followers of that Bourbaki group, I protest
against Andre's "two options" and I insist that Bourbaki group simply =
did
not see the importance of category theory (in spite of being brilliant
mathematicians, as I said in my previous message). I hope Andre will =
forgive
me and even agree with me.

However, there were three great category-theorists in that group (plus =
there
is this mysterious story about Chevalley's book of category theory lost =
in

I was just paging through a copy of "The Princeton Companion to
Mathematics. Tim Gowers and all who contributed to this volume did a
superb job in producing such a comprehensive and in-depth look at the
culture and content of mathematics.

There is, I think, one lacuna in this otherwise wonderful book. Eugenia
Cheng wrote a very fine two page explanation of the concept of a category
for this volume. But in the 350 pages devoted to the various branches of
mathematics, 350 pages divided into 26 topics such as Algebraic Geometry,
Algebraic Topology, Differential Topology, Harmonic Analysis etc, there is
no article on Category Theory. This should be contrasted with the 11 page
article on Set Theory, and the 12 page article on Logic and Model Theory.

What does this say about the general perception of the proper role for
category theory in mathematics?

Of course sketches are mathematical objects in their own right.  Of
course, the functor that assigns to each sketch the corresponding theory
is not full or faithful.  But the definition is precise, the notion of
model is also precise, so I have no idea what, if any, content there is in
the claim.  Incidentally, you might with equal justice claim that triples
are not mathematical objects since two distinct triples can have
isomorphic categories of Eilenberg-Moore algebras.  In fact there are
triples (or theories) on Set that have infinitary operations, yet whose
category of models is isomorphic to Set.

The three books I have authored or co-authored all contain a chapter of
about 40 pages that is an introduction to category theory.  They are
largely identical (the one for Acyclic Models has a an added section on
categories of fractions, needed for that book).  The one in TTT is already
freely available and, with Charles's permission, I would happily post that
in whatever place you would like.

Hello

1) I agree completely with Andre, or, more properly, with Samuel
Eilemberg and Pierre Cartier (Andre just tel us what they said to him
when he ask them the question)

So the problem is not wether to agree with Andre or not, but wether to
agree with Eilemberg-Cartier or not. They said to Andre:

"Bourbaki had essentially two options: rewrite the whole treaty using
categories,
or just introduce them in the book on homological algebra,
The second option won, essentially because of the enormity of the task
of rewriting everything."

2) We can see that this makes sense too, the  Bourbaki Tractate was
already written, and Grothendieck's proposal was to entirely rewrite the
thing !!

3) Also, Bourbaki Tractate, as it is, is a masterful book. It is just
perfect, or as close to perfection as possible. It sets a way,
philosophy and style to write mathematics. I myself (as Andre) have
learned a lot by reading Bourbaki, and, more than that, I enjoyed the
reading (and the task to understand it) as much as I enjoy any reading
where I can see perfection in every sense (as in Borges for example).

4) So, it is a lost  for mathematics and for category theory that
category theory fit in Bourbaki's goal as a foundational theory (as set
theory is) , and not just as one more part of mathematics (as set theory
is not).

What a marvelous book just on category theory Bourbaki could have
written, can you imagine !!

A Boubaki book on category theory !!

We miss it  . . .

5) Concerning "desdain", I recall to all of you that most of the people
who show desdain for category theory, also show desdain for Bourbaki.

Eduardo.

Michael,

That seems a very good and generous idea!

It could  initially be posted on your site, except that it should also be
indefinitely available.

The pdf should have hyperref, and perhaps there should be a complete version
and also a parcelled version, so that wiki and Planet Math could have links
to specific parts. What do you think?

Ronnie

I'll try to explain why there is no contradiction.
1. Charles only participated actively to the Bourbaki group from 1935 =20
to the mid forties, at a time he did not know category theory. In 1935 =20
he had written a first version for the volume "Theorie des ensembles" =20
where he introduced the notions of local structures and associated =20
pseudogroups of transformations (not so far from groupoids!), but this =20
version was not accepted and he did not like the final version =20
published much later. After the war, he only participated irregularly =20
because he felt that he was no more able to make himself heard, the =20
decisions being taken by "those who spoke the more loudly" (as he said =20
to me).
2. Around 1950 it was decided that active participation ended at 45 =20
(the age Charles had then), lessening the influence of those =20
(Eilenberg, Cartan, Chevalley and Dieudonne) who  could have stressed =20
the importance of categories. I don't know exactly when Grothendieck =20
became a member, but it was much later, and I think he did not remain =20
for long. Later on, disdain for category theory had developed in =20
France...
3. As for the communication between Charles and the other =20
category-theorists, he had no contact with Grothendieck who was much =20
younger. He was friendly with Eilenberg but did not see him often. =20
Before the war he lived in Paris and regularly met Henri Cartan, =20
Dieudonne, and more specially, Chevalley (both had regular exchanges =20
with the philosophers Cavailles and Lautman). But their communication =20
almost ceased after the war when he developed all his activity in =20
Strasbourg (up to 1955) and was out of France for a long part of the =20
year. Anyway, before our joint work (from the mid sixties up to his =20
death), Charles worked essentially alone and published no joint work =20
at all, except 6 Notes on Topology or Geometry with some of his =20
students. When he began to specialize in category theory in the =20
sixties, it was not well understood by other French mathematicians, =20
and his influence dwindled up to a real opposition in the seventies.

Do we imagine this new Bourbaki as just systematizing and
presenting what we know already, or struggling to create
brand new mathematics?

I can imagine a new Bourbaki who tries to explain all of
mathematics in the language of categories.  But I can
also imagine a new Bourbaki who tries to explain all of
mathematics in the language of infinity-categories.  It
may be a bit too late for the first one, and a bit too
early for the second one.

Perhaps we need both!

In this discussion I would like to mention some things about Alexander =
Grothendieck:

In 1958 at Edinburgh ICM (me very callow!) I happened to hear Raoul Bott =
say 2 things which expressed his own amazement about AG:

One was that AG could play with concepts and make something real of it. =
(Compare AG's comment to me much later: `The introduction of the cipher =
0 or the group concept was general nonsense too, and mathematics was =
more or less stagnating for thousands of years because nobody was around =
to take such childish steps ...',) I like the idea that `childish steps' =
should still be possible in mathematics, and may be more fun than trying =
the famous problem line. In fact Saul Ulam told me at a conference in =
Sicily in 1964 that a young person may think that the most ambitious =
thing to do is to try for solving a famous problem; but this might =
distract them from developing the mathematics most appropriate to them. =
I was not in danger of the former, but I thought it interesting that =
someone so good as Ulam should make this comment, and think it worth  =
publicising, since it is relevant to aims. =20

The other comment of Bott was that AG was prepared to work very hard to =
make things become tautologous. Should one say this is also (except in =
the exercises!) the intention of Bourbaki ?=20

AG also mentioned to me that his initial direction at Paris was not =
viewed favourably until it proved the generalisation of the Riemann-Roch =
theorem!=20

Dear Michael,

Still some content in Steve's claim could be imagined. A working
mathematician (WM) works with Borubaki's structures like groups or
vector spaces and leaves all worries about what his proofs actually
mean for a working math logician.  For such a WM, sketches (as any
other syntactical machineries) are indeed technical minutiae rather
than mathematical objects. It'd be perhaps a reasonable view unless a
bunch of strong semantic results (Tarski, Mal'cev,Robinson) that our
WM values so much, which are provided by bringing syntax onto the
stage.

Dear Michael,

Semantically, as Lawvere observed long ago, a monad gives rise not just t=
o
a category of algebras but also to a forgetful functor into the category
on which the monad acts. For any category C the functor

"semantics" : Mnd(C)^op --> CAT/C

whose object map sends a monad on C to its associated forgetful functor i=
s
full and faithful. Thus a pair of monads on C giving rise to isomorphic
forgetful functors must necessarily be isomorphic. So your observations
about different monads giving rise to the same algebras, while correct, d=
o
not tell the whole story on the semantic side.

The situation is of course different for sketches: they too give rise to
forgetful functors (into Set), but this does not suffice to determine a
given sketch up to isomorphism in the same way, and this justifies Steve
Lack's perspective of "sketches as presentations of theories".

Here are some further remarks on the interesting concepts discussed in
George's post and the replies to it.  Incidentally, I prefer the term
"non-commutative category theory" to "non-Cartesian ...", but that's a
personal matter.

If A is an algebra over a field  k, then, in the context of the internal
category theory introduced in Aguiar's 1997 thesis, an  A-coring is simpl=
y
an internal category in the dual of the monoidal category  Vec(k)  of=20
k-spaces.  On the other hand, the notion of internal category in Vec(k)
itself includes (but is more general than) the small k-linear categories
in Mitchell's 1972 paper, "Rings with Several Objects".  I think it is
useful to view these 2 concepts as special cases of the same general
theory.  Some of the constructions for corings in the book of Brzezinski
and Wisbauer are special cases of categorical notions developed in
Aguiar's thesis.

Corings have been around for awhile, as Sweedler's original paper
introducing them was published in 1975, and they appeared in at least a
few other papers during the ensuing 20 years (e.g., Takeuchi's
monograph on a Morita theory for monoidal categories of bimodules, which =
I
think was published in the Journal of the Math. Society of Japan).=20
Sweedler's version of Jacobson's theorem in his paper seems to be a sort
of non-commutative analogue of the connection between equivalence
relations and quotient spaces.

Aguiar's framework is probably not general enough to cover some cases of
interest.  It may be that one should begin simply with a monad in an
arbitrary bicategory, since at least a few of the basic concepts for
internal categories can be developed in that setting.  Taking the
bicategory to be Vec(k) with a single object, the important notion of
entwined structure, discussed in work of Caenepeel, Brzezinski, Pareigis,
and others, then appears as a sort of distributive law, but relating a
monad and a comonad rather than 2 monads.  The theorem that an entwined
structure is equivalent to a certain type of coring is then apparently an
analogue of Beck's theorem.

One would like the theory to include Takeuchi's notion of X-bialgebra
(which generalizes concepts developed earlier by Sweedler and,
independently, David Winter).  However, to that end it appears useful to
enrich the bicategory so that the
1-endomorphisms of an object (and 2-morphisms between them) constitute a
2-monoidal category in the sense of [M. Aguiar and S. Mahajan, Hopf
Monoids in Species and Associated Hopf Algebras] (see Chapter 5, although
most of that monograph, not yet completed, is on a quite different
subject).  There is a link to the monograph from Aguiar's website.  He an=

I have had some discussions on these matters during the summer, but there
is still much about this situation that we (or, at least, I) don't
understand.

Is it necessary to have a global point of view to appreciate Bourbaki? I

In my last post I said that sketches give rise to forgetful functors into
Set, which is obviously wrong -- the forgetful functor arising from a
given sketch is into the functor category [A,Set], where A is the
underlying category of the sketch, and this forgetful functor doesn't
determine the sketch up to isomorphism.

Let me add my two cents :)

On Tue, Sep 16, 2008 at 4:57 AM, Vaughan Pratt <pratt@cs.stanford.edu> wrote:

We can think of two definitions of math. The first is based on the
subject matter ("what"): math is the study of Bourbaki's structures.
The other is based on "how:"  math is the study of structures in a
well-structured way. With this definition, a good computer programmer
or, say, Henry Ford, who applied conveyor to assembling, are more
mathematicians than some of the guys responsible for what Vaughan
wrote about.

If we imagine a two dimensional plane with the "what" axis being
vertical and the "how" horizontal, then we get two mathematics and
resp. two sorts of mathematicians: vertical and horizontal. (CT and
CT-rists go, of course, along the harmonized diagonal :).
Historically, Bourbaki put a bold point on the line of
Euclid-Peano-Hilbert and indeed formed the vertical dimension of the
modern mathematical space.  However, while the very texts written by
Bourbaki are mostly enjoyable, his epigones have created a special
literary style, which is good for writing/producing but hardly for
reading mathematical papers.  Bourbaki should not be blamed for wide
dissemination of this indigestible style but...Vladimir Arnold once
said that  "bourbakization" of modern mathematics should perhaps be
called "oBourbachivanie" in Russian (which rhymes with the Russian
"oDourachivanie", which refers to fooling with someone :).

Dinosaurs would not normally die off themselves. Some causes are
needed, and here's one  (somewhat speculative though). CT can change
the very notion of what a formal definition is. In the modern style,
the notion of ordered pair/tuple and its derivatives like formula and
term are central.  This quite simple syntax (as is often happens with
simple syntax, think, for example, of a Java program)  can hide
complex structures so that a tuple-based formal definition is not
actually formal and implicitly involves intuitive concepts. If CT will
sometime indeed reshape the criteria of being a formal specification
(of a Bourbaki's structure), then dinosaurs would be forced to acquire
CT (or die off).

Okay, sketches are presentations of theories but Steve's claim was
that they are not mathematical objects. Michael's and mine
bewilderment is about why does the former imply the latter?  (at
least, why "of course" :)

I think it's a great idea and I have no objection.

Wikibooks has a draft of a book about category theory at

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category_theory

and a stub for course notes at

http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Category_Theory

It wouldn't be a good idea to simply replace what is already written there
with the intro part of TTT but some of it could be put in to cover
additional topics and provide more examples.

I have done some work on Wikipedia and need to warn you that pretty soon
what you wrote may be changed in many ways, in the small and in the large ;
if you are anal about what you write this can be upsetting.  In any case the
original TTT will remain on the web as it is.

You have a real talent to explain a subject by exposing the heuristic!
A discussion forum like the "Categories list" is also very helpful.
Wikipedia is a useful place to gather informations about a subject.
But the Bourbaki Tractate was offering something more:
a unified presentation of mathematics, including the proofs.

The Bourbaki Tractate was the result of a sustained collaboration=20
of many generations of mathematicians from different fields.=20
Conflicts are inevitable and mathematics evolve quickly.
A unified, final presentation seems impossible.

A partially unified evolving presentation of mathematics seems possible.
Today's litt=E9rature is already offering something like that!
But I find it cahotic and complicated.
But mathematics is naturally organised and simple!
The complexity of the litterature is often artificial.
Many proofs are complicated, simply because the author
ignores the abstract argument that could simplify everything.
Some statements are left unproved, and peremptory declared obvious
when they are not. The reader who cant see the obvious thing is =
terrorised.
He may as well quit mathematics.=20

What can we do?

Let me submit a few ideas for disccusion.

Mathematics is naturally self-organised.=20
The proof of most theorems can be broken in small steps of the form=20
A_1,..,A_n --->B, where A_1,..,A_n is the list
of hypothesis and B is the conclusion.=20
Each step may have a simple proof.
A complete proof maybe obtained by working
backward from the statement of the theorem to=20
the axioms ot to known theorems.=20

Everyone who knows a nice proof of a meaningful=20
implication A_1,..,A_n --->B should write
a paper about it and put it in a special section of the arXiv (the NB =

A special database for mathematics should be created
(but I dont know how).
Papers in the NB section of the arXves could be selected,
modified and organised with a system of references,
to give a partially unified presentation of mathematics.=20
The same database could support different

Each team could work like a mathematical journal,
with an editor in chief and an editorial board.

What do you think?

What I actually said was this:

"Sketches are not mathematical objects in their own right, in the same sense
that groups or spaces are. They are presentations (for theories), and have
status similar to other sorts of presentations (for groups, rings, etc.)

Of course that is in no way meant to suggest that they are not important and
worthy of study."

So I did not say that "they are not mathematical objects", and I used the
words "of course" only in clarifying that I was not suggesting that they
were unimportant. What I was saying was that they have a different flavour
to such mathematical objects as groups or spaces. I was saying this in
response to the observation that sketches did not seem to fit into the
Bourbaki notion of structure, and so in particular, that the notion of
isomorphism of sketch was not as crucial as that of isomorphism of group.

Michael Barr asked what the content of the statement might be. I certainly
wasn't trying to make a precise mathematical statement, although Michael
himself indicated one that could be made. I guess that my second sentence
(that sketches are presentations) is the content. So the content, if you
like, is "whatever status you give to group presentations, you should give
the same to sketches". For my part, I think that presentations are extremely
important technical tools, which need to be studied and understood; but
which nonetheless are just that: technical tools for dealing with the real
objects of study (the things they present).

All,

i have been utterly delighted by this conversation. What i can't help but
think about, however, is that with the internet we have a different sort of
opportunity. Let me try to describe it.

   - What is missing in most mathematical presentations is a view into the
   often very human and very messy process of getting to the presentation. =
What
   young mathematicians need -- in my view -- is a view of mathematicians d=
oing
   mathematics. They need to see very top-down orientations rubbing elbows =
with
   very bottoms-up orientations. They need to see highly inventive, unifyin=
g
   viewpoints come up against skeptical viewpoints armed with vast arrays o=
f
   counter-examples. They need to see people desperately trying to organize
   while others are desperately trying to de-construct. This is where the l=
ife
   of mathematics is. This is how people bring mathematics to life.
   - With the internet we have the opportunity to record not just the final
   artifact, tractate or wiki, but the process. Ever since Andre Joyal
   mentioned a 2nd life for Bourbaki i can't stop thinking about a Bourbaki
   colloquium run in Second Life <http://secondlife.com/> -- so that
   whatever the outcome of a given process is in terms of artifact, people =
can
   go back and look at the process, itself. They can see how people argued =
and
   counter-argued. There is getting to be a precendent for this, from
   Harvard<http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/12/harvard-class-invades-second-l=
ife/>to
   Intel <http://softwarecommunity.intel.com/articles/eng/1283.htm>, to run
   serious technical conversation in Second Life.

Perhaps this idea is too far out, but i would urge those who seriously
consider a second life for Bourbaki to remember to record the living part a=
s
well as the outcome. After all, looking over the last many emails to
categories so much of it is an attempt to recover process -- how things got
to be where they are.

Best wishes,

--greg

Yes, all this "discussion" is mainly misunderstanding, and I apologize
if I've contributed to it. It seems it was triggered by this piece:

So, the issue is closed. Still there is some point to mention, and I
again apologize if I'm peering into it too much. Our entire
mis-discussion is, perhaps, a result of two different attitudes. CT
favors and prefers to work in a presentation-free setting while
engineering applications are all about presentations; and this
mismatch may contribute to the disdain of CT from the practitioners'
side.  (Of course, this is not meant to anyhow diminish the elegance,
value and usefulness even for practical problems such concepts as
triple or classifying category :).

He didn't say that.  He wisely said something much more cautious.

It's easy to appreciate their books locally - but I think they
sought a global systematic viewpoint while writing them.

It's possible that a "neo-Bourbaki" should take a less systematic
approach.  Mathematics may be too much in a state of foundational
flux for a systematic approach to be successful right now.  Maybe
the best we can hope for is something a bit more like Wikipedia,
where different people contribute different portions of text, and
they don't cohere in a polished whole.  But presumably anyone calling
for a new Bourbaki wants something different from Wikipedia.

There's "Scholarpedia":

http://www.scholarpedia.org/

but it doesn't seem to be doing anything with math yet, and if
it ever does, I bet it'll take a "midde-of-the-road" approach instead
of pushing a specific intellectual agenda.

I would like to see lots of people try lots of different things.

Best,
jb

I hereby volunteer my time and the technical resources I have at my
disposal to 'host' a "New Bourbaki based on CT" project.

Why me?
1. I am an interested _user_ of category theory, but not an 'inventor'
in the field.  Neutrality is frequently an asset in a "keeper of the
infrastructure".
2. I need the results of such a project!  My core work (for 11 years in
industry and now 6 in academia) is in "mechanized mathematics", or
computer-based tools that help automate the mathematics process,
explicitly including both computation (i.e. what Maple does) and proof
(i.e. what Coq does).  (The curious can see
http://imps.mcmaster.ca/mathscheme/publications.html for some of our
work and my personal publications page for more).  One cannot
simultaneously build a library of mathematics and know category theory
without seeing its tendrils everywhere.
3. I have a real stake in seeing "mathematics on computers": not only is
it my day-to-day research, I am also the Chair of the Electronic
Services Committee for the Canadian Mathematical Society (CMS).  I am
actively searching for *good* applications of "electronic services"
where we can get involved.

I cannot promise the resources of the CMS for this, but I can certainly
promise to bring this up as an agenda item for our December meeting in
Ottawa.  However, I would be extremely proud if I could claim, years
from now, that "Bourwiki" was a ``truly international project which
benefited from a strong involvement of the Canadian Mathematical Society''.

Jacques Carette

PS: Below here are some minor comments/thoughts on the various topics in
this email thread -- the only important parts are above.
1. I am fairly fond of the (awfully titled) book "Post-modern Algebra"

http://www.amazon.com/Post-Modern-Algebra-Applied-Mathematics-Wiley-Interscience/dp/0471127388
  by J. Smith and A. Romanwska, as a middle-ground between full-fledged
use of categories and classical algebra in an introductory text.  The
organization of the text is definitely non-classical and tries to
organize concepts according to mathematical criteria rather than
historical timelines.
2. I definitely believe that a proper encoding of modern mathematics
into a 'library' should be done top-done by specializing abstract
concepts.  The "Little Theories" method from theorem proving is
essentially the recognition that a large body of mathematics is a huge
diagram in an appropriate category of theories. These issues are all too
frequently treated as meta-mathematical.  The constructive theory of
"representations of theories" (via sketches or otherwise) can play a
very important role in software construction.
3. Heuristics and examples are crucial for human understanding of
mathematics.  Thus, while a "mechanized mathematics system" may be built
from highly abstract pieces, it needs to present itself to its users in
as concrete a manner as possible.  This dichotomy between
system-building and usability is further explored in a paper "High-Level
Theories" (available officially at
http://www.springerlink.com/content/b1122523vtm88w73/, unofficially at
http://imps.mcmaster.ca/doc/hlt.pdf )
4. I cannot over-emphasize my agreement with Joyal's statement that "But
mathematics is naturally organised and simple!"
5. To a certain degree, some libraries (like those of the large theorem
provers) attempt "partially unified presentations of mathematics"; some
even have pseudo-databases.  These are unfortunately quite classical in
their structure, with the exception of the work of the Kestrel Institute
(in computer science) which is very categorical.  The algebra library of
the programming language 'Aldor' (www.aldor.org) was definitely
influenced by categories.  Category theory is actively influencing the
development of the language 'Haskell'.
6. What I propose to help with are the technical and online aspects of
Andre Joyal's proposal:
> A special database for mathematics should be created
> (but I dont know how).
> Papers in the NB section of the arXves could be selected,
> modified and organised with a system of references,
> to give a partially unified presentation of mathematics.
> The same database could support different
> presentations realised by different competing teams.
> Each team could work like a mathematical journal,
> with an editor in chief and an editorial board.
>
using means like the ones which Andrej Bauer suggested.

A group presentation consists of a bunch of symbols and some equations
between strings of some of the symbols and some of their formal inverses.
 The symbols are the arrows of the graph, and the diagrams exhibit the
equations.  The type of theory (instead of FP theory, FL theory, coherent
theory or whatever) is that of categories in which all arrows have inverses
(groupoids) to which if you insist you may add any two arrows compose
(groups).  A model of a sketch in a category takes each arrow to an
isomorphism in such a way that the diagrams commute.  The presentation
generates a group, and that group is the theory.  The category of actions of
the theory on category is clearly equivalent to the category of models of
the presentation as sketch.
This brings up a point.  An FP theory (for example) is typically thought of
as having models in an FP category, but in fact it can have models in any
category.  The necessary finite products must exist, but others can be
missing.  Nevertheless, most of the examples that have actually been
considered are in categories that do have all finite products (in other
words are within the doctrine).  In the case of a group presentation, it is
_normal_ to consider models in categories in which most arrows don't have
isomorphisms (they are not within the doctrine).  This is only a
psychological difference, but it is interesting.

Objet : categories: Re: Bourbaki and Categories
=20
I hereby volunteer my time and the technical resources I have at my
disposal to 'host' a "New Bourbaki based on CT" project.

Why me?
1. I am an interested _user_ of category theory, but not an 'inventor'
in the field.  Neutrality is frequently an asset in a "keeper of the
infrastructure".
2. I need the results of such a project!  My core work (for 11 years in
industry and now 6 in academia) is in "mechanized mathematics", or
computer-based tools that help automate the mathematics process,
explicitly including both computation (i.e. what Maple does) and proof
(i.e. what Coq does).  (The curious can see
http://imps.mcmaster.ca/mathscheme/publications.html for some of our
work and my personal publications page for more).  One cannot
simultaneously build a library of mathematics and know category theory
without seeing its tendrils everywhere.
3. I have a real stake in seeing "mathematics on computers": not only is
it my day-to-day research, I am also the Chair of the Electronic
Services Committee for the Canadian Mathematical Society (CMS).  I am
actively searching for *good* applications of "electronic services"
where we can get involved.

I cannot promise the resources of the CMS for this, but I can certainly
promise to bring this up as an agenda item for our December meeting in
Ottawa.  However, I would be extremely proud if I could claim, years
from now, that "Bourwiki" was a ``truly international project which
benefited from a strong involvement of the Canadian Mathematical =
Society''.

Jacques Carette

PS: Below here are some minor comments/thoughts on the various topics in
this email thread -- the only important parts are above.
1. I am fairly fond of the (awfully titled) book "Post-modern Algebra"

http://www.amazon.com/Post-Modern-Algebra-Applied-Mathematics-Wiley-Inter=
science/dp/0471127388
  by J. Smith and A. Romanwska, as a middle-ground between full-fledged
use of categories and classical algebra in an introductory text.  The
organization of the text is definitely non-classical and tries to
organize concepts according to mathematical criteria rather than
historical timelines.
2. I definitely believe that a proper encoding of modern mathematics
into a 'library' should be done top-done by specializing abstract
concepts.  The "Little Theories" method from theorem proving is
essentially the recognition that a large body of mathematics is a huge
diagram in an appropriate category of theories. These issues are all too
frequently treated as meta-mathematical.  The constructive theory of
"representations of theories" (via sketches or otherwise) can play a
very important role in software construction.
3. Heuristics and examples are crucial for human understanding of
mathematics.  Thus, while a "mechanized mathematics system" may be built
from highly abstract pieces, it needs to present itself to its users in
as concrete a manner as possible.  This dichotomy between
system-building and usability is further explored in a paper "High-Level
Theories" (available officially at
http://www.springerlink.com/content/b1122523vtm88w73/, unofficially at
http://imps.mcmaster.ca/doc/hlt.pdf )
4. I cannot over-emphasize my agreement with Joyal's statement that "But
mathematics is naturally organised and simple!"
5. To a certain degree, some libraries (like those of the large theorem
provers) attempt "partially unified presentations of mathematics"; some
even have pseudo-databases.  These are unfortunately quite classical in
their structure, with the exception of the work of the Kestrel Institute
(in computer science) which is very categorical.  The algebra library of
the programming language 'Aldor' (www.aldor.org) was definitely
influenced by categories.  Category theory is actively influencing the
development of the language 'Haskell'.
6. What I propose to help with are the technical and online aspects of
Andre Joyal's proposal:
> A special database for mathematics should be created
> (but I dont know how).
> Papers in the NB section of the arXves could be selected,
> modified and organised with a system of references,
> to give a partially unified presentation of mathematics.
> The same database could support different
> presentations realised by different competing teams.
> Each team could work like a mathematical journal,
> with an editor in chief and an editorial board.
>
using means like the ones which Andrej Bauer suggested.

a view into the often very human process of interaction

The ontological status of "presentations of structures" is a key issue in
the history of mathematics in the 20th century. I wrote a number of
historical material about it. The following (in French) are available on

Please distribute widely to students with interest in a PhD:


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  2 Phd Studentships in Program Semantics and Verification

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

available at the University of Sussex (Brighton, UK)

to work on an EPSRC funded project the objectives of which is to
develop program logics for function pointers and reflective
programming principles.

Candidates need tp have a good BSc/MSc in Computer Science or
Mathematics and should have some interest in programming languages and
formal methods.  Background in Logic, Semantics, Category Theory, or
Type Theory may be useful but is not essential.  On the more practical
side, experience with theorem provers would be an asset.

Students can take on theoretical problems as well as participate in
concrete tool development or extension.

The studentship (funded by the EPSRC, grant EP/G003173/1) will cover
all tuition fees (for EU citizens) and a yearly maintenance grant at
the standard rate (currently GBP 12,940). Students will be working
under the supervision of Dr Bernhard Reus (PI) and in collaboration
with a Post-Doc embedded in the Foundations of Computation Group of
the Department.

The University is situated in Brighton which is a famous seaside
resort at the English south coast, about 50 miles from London (and
half an hour from Gatwick Airport). It is renowned for its nightlife,
fabulous shops, and cosmopolitan vibe.

For further information about the project consult

<http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/research/projects/PL4HOStore/>

Candidates interested in the studentships should contact:

Dr Bernhard Reus (bernhard@sussex.ac.uk)

Hi all,

Does anyone know of a good place where someone has written down the basic
properties of such objects?  As an example, if we have an (abelian, say)
topological group, there is a natural uniform topology on the group such
that the operations are uniformly continuous.  Does the same hold for
abelian group objects in the category of Kelley spaces?  But anything
would be helpful.

In addition to the peoples who have expressed their support in public

We have a proposed schedule of talks for the Octoberfest meeting next
weekend (4-5 Oct).  Please be aware that changes may still happen, and
a final schedule will be given out at the meeting itself.  An html
version of this document is available at the meeting website, and you
can check there for any last-minute changes, as we know them.

  http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/octoberfest08.html

Some talks are still "TBA" - I hope the speakers will give me titles
asap!  We have some abstracts - those we have will be available on the
webpage (and I'll put others there as I get them).

In addition, I suggest folks review the instructions on the website re
location of the talks (at Concordia's Faubourg building), parking in
the area (the university has indoor parking from 9am - a bit of a
tight squeeze in terms of time, but possible - and there is metered
parking on the streets around the area), and do check the weather
(there are links to two weather sites on the webpage).

I have not thought deeply on this, but it strikes me that the basic
problem is that such a group might not have a uniform topology.  Such a
group will have, I think, a separately continuous multiplication and
hence, if U is a neighborhood of the identity {xU|x \in G} will be a
cover, but there would seem no obvious reason for it to have a
*-refinement.  A continuous homomorphism would be uniformly continuous for
those covers, if they do form a uniformity, it seems to me.

If only John Isbell were still around to answer this kind of question, a
wish I have wished many times since and well before his demise.  But have
you looked in his uniform spaces book?  That is the sort of thing he might
well have considered.  If I were around the math library, I would look.

It is interesting that an answer to this question, before it was asked
here in the categories list, came up two weeks ago in a discussion I
had with Jimmie Lawson and Matthias Schroeder.

Schroeder showed recently that N^(N^N), where N is discrete and the
exponential is calculated in k-spaces, is not regular, and hence not
zero-dimensional either, which was an open problem (notice that the
compact-open topology on N^(N^N) is easily seen to be
zero-dimensional).

Lawson observed that this is isomorphic to Z^(N^N), which, with the
pointwise operations, is an abelian group in the category of k-spaces.
This gives your counter-example. Lawson also said that
counter-examples to complete regularity of k-groups where previously
known among the experts in the subject, but were more complicated
and/or artificial. (I don't know references.)

I hope this helps.

As others have already noted, the answer is no.  One possible
solution (assuming you regard this as a defect) is to apply
the idea implicit in the definition of Kelley space, not to
the category of all topological spaces, but to that of all
Tychonov (=uniformisable) spaces.  What results is a cartesian
closed category (that of "k_R-Tychonov spaces") with somewhat
different properties; a group in this category is tautologously
uniformisable and, if I recall correctly, is also true that the
operations are uniformly continuous.  Gabor Lukacs has studied
these things and spoken about them at several conferences.

Cheers,
Jeff.

Readers of Jaap van Oosten's new book on realizability will have
come across the statement on p. 235 that the question "Is Set the
only Grothendieck topos which occurs as a subtopos of the effective
topos?", which Ieke Moerdijk asked him at his Ph.D. viva in 1991,
is still unanswered. In fact I've known the answer to this question
for at least five years: I referred to it in my talks at the European
category theory meeting in Haute-Bodeux (September 2003) and the
meeting on Ramifications of Category Theory in Firenze (November 2003).
However, the proof hasn't been published anywhere (it will of course be in
volume 3 of the Elephant when that is published -- and please don't
ask me to predict when that will be!), so I thought I should let people
know about it.

We work in the realizability topos over an arbitrary pca A (all
unexplained notation can be found in Jaap's book). Andy Pitts showed
in his thesis that local operators on this topos correspond to maps
j: PA --> PA whch "are nuclei in the logic of A-realizability", and
that the corresponding subtopos of sheaves is equivalent to Set (or
degenerate) iff the intersection \bigcap_{a \in A} j({a})
is inhabited. Suppose this condition fails;
we shall show that the subtopos of j-sheaves is not complete.
Let A_1 denote the assembly with underlying set A and
[[a \in A_1]] = {a} for all a, and A_2 the assembly with the
same underlying set and [[a \in A_2]] = j({a}). Note that A_2 is the
j-closure of A_1 in \nabla A, and hence its associated j-sheaf.
Also, by the assumption we've made, it is not the whole of \nabla A.

We claim that the product of A copies of A_2 cannot exist in the
topos of sheaves: if it did, it would obviously be a subobject of
\nabla(A^A) (the latter being the product of A copies of \nabla A)
and hence an assembly; moreover, its underlying set would be the
whole of A^A since the forgetful functor from assemblies to Set
(is representable, and hence) preserves all products which exist.
Writing P for the product, for each a \in A the a^th projection
A^A --> A must be trackable as a morphism P --> A_2; let e_a be
an element of A which tracks it. Since A_2 is not the whole of
\nabla A, we can find f(a) such that e_aa \not \in [[f(a) \in A_2]]
(if e_aa is undefined, choose f(a) to be any element of A). Then
f: A --> A has no realizers as a member of P.

The term "Kelley space" is a misnomer
(due to Gabriel & Zisman ?), resulting from
a misinterpretation of the prefix in "k-space".
JLK's excellent 1955 textbook, from which=20
many of us learned mathematics, was not doing
subtle self-promotion when he used that term in=20
his clear exposition. In  fact, "k" stands for
kompakt, and the term was used by
Hurewicz in his 1949 lectures at Princeton where
he introduced these spaces. I have that from
telephone discussions with the late David Gale,
who had mentioned Hurewicz's k-spaces in his=20
1950 PAMS paper (as noticed by Horst Herrlich).
The same implicit idea is used in RH Fox's 1945
paper (except  based on countable=20
compact spaces instead of all), which was directly
incited by a letter from Hurewicz.
