36 Months Postdoctoral Position in Colagebraic Logics
Department of Computing, Imperial College London


A three year postdoctoral position is available from March 1, 2008 (or
as soon as possible thereafter) to work on an EPSRC-funded project in
the area of coalgebras and modal logic.

Coalgebraic semantics allows the representation of a large class of
structurally different modal logics in a uniform semantic framework
where the particular type of observations that determines a specific
model class is parameterized by an endofunctor. The aim of the project
is to study fixpoint logics and logics axiomatized with  nested
modalities in this setting. More information on the project and the
position advert can be found at

   http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dirk/CML/

or email me (dirk@doc.ic.ac.uk) regarding further queries.

With best wishes for 2008,

Dirk Pattinson.

* Applications:   Databases,    Data   Integration  and   Federation,  Software
   Engineering,  Natural  Language  Processing,  Web  and Semantic Web, Agents,
   Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics

The three broad categories for submissions are:
   (1) Technical papers,  providing  novel research  contributions,  innovative
       perspectives  on the field,  and/or novel integrations  across different
       areas;
   (2) Application  papers,  describing  innovative uses  of  logic programming
       technology in real-world application domains;
   (3) Posters, ideal for presenting and discussing current work, not yet ready
       for publication, for PhD thesis summaries and research project overviews.

A  separate  session  dedicated  to  the celebration of the 20th anniversary of
stable model semantics will also be part of the program.

Accepted  papers and posters will be allocated time for presentation during the
conference.  At  least  one  author  of each accepted submission is expected to
register and participate in the event.

In  addition  to papers and posters, the technical program will include invited
talks,  advanced  tutorials,  specialized  sessions,  workshops, and a Doctoral
Student  Consortium.  Details,  as  they  become  available  will be posted at:

                          http://iclp08.dimi.uniud.it

PAPERS AND POSTERS
------------------
Papers and posters must describe original, previously unpublished research, and
must  not  be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere. Emphasis will
be  placed  on  the  novelty  and innovative nature of the results (even if not
completely polished and refined).
All  submissions  will  be peer-reviewed by an international panel. Submissions
MUST contain substantial original, unpublished material.
All  submissions  must  be written in English. Technical papers and application
papers must not exceed 15 pages in the Springer LNCS format

                   (see http://www.springeronline.com/lncs/)

The limit for posters is 5 pages in the same format.

The  primary  means  of  submission  will  be electronic, through the Easychair
submission system. The submission page is available at

               http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ICLP08


PUBLICATION
-----------
The  proceedings  of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag in the
LNCS  series.  All  accepted  papers  and  posters  will  be  included  in  the
proceedings.

WORKSHOPS
---------
The  ICLP'08  program will include several workshops. They are perhaps the best
place  for  the  presentation  of  preliminary  work, novel ideas, and new open
problems  to  a more focused and specialized audience. Workshops also provide a
venue  for  presenting  specialised  topics  and  opportunities  for  intensive
discussions   and   project   collaboration  in  any  areas  related  to  logic
programming, including cross-disciplinary areas.

DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM
-------------------
The  Doctoral  Consortium  (DC)  on  Logic  Programming  is  the  4th  Doctoral
consortium  to  provide  doctoral  students with the opportunity to present and
discuss  their  research directions, and to obtain feedback from both peers and
word-renown  experts  in the field. The DC will also offer invited speakers and
panel discussions. Accepted participants will receive partial financial support
to  attend  the  event and the main conference. The best paper and presentation
from  the DC will be given the opportunity to present in special session of the
main ICLP conference.

CELEBRATING 20th YEARS OF STABLE MODEL SEMANTICS
------------------------------------------------
The year 2008 marks the 20th anniversary of the publication that introduced the
stable  model semantics for logic programs with negation. The paper titled "The
stable  semantics for logic programs" by Michael Gelfond and Vladimir Lifschitz
was  presented  at  ICLP-1988.  It  was  a  momentous event that gave rise to a
vibrant  subfield of logic programming known now as the answer-set programming.
Its  distinguishing  aspects  are  close connections to the fields of knowledge
representation,   satisfiability   and  constraint  satisfaction,  ever  faster
computational tools, and a growing list of successful applications.

To  celebrate  the  stable-model  semantics, there will be a special session at
ICLP  2008  dedicated to answer-set programming. The session will feature talks
by  Michael  Gelfond  and  Vladimir  Lifschitz.  as  well  as  by  other  major
contributions   to   the   field,   presenting  personal  perspectives  on  the
stable-model  semantics,  its  impact  and  its  future.  There will be a panel
discussion,  and  regular  accepted  ICLP  papers  falling  into the answer-set
programming area will complete the program.


CONFERENCE VENUE
----------------
The conference will be held in the city of Udine, the capital of the historical
region  of  Friuli, Italy. Located between the Adriatic sea and the Alps, close
to  Venice,  Austria  and Slovenia, Udine is a city of Roman origins, funded by
Emperor  Otto  in  983.  Rich of historical sites, Udine is also famous for its
commercial  and  shopping  opportunities  and its outstanding wine and culinary
traditions.

SUPPORT SPONSORING AND AWARDS
-----------------------------
The conference is sponsored by the Association for Logic Programming (ALP). The
ALP  has  funds  to  assist  financially disadvantaged participants. The ALP is
planning  to sponsor two awards for ICLP 2008: for the best technical paper and
for the best student paper.

Title: 2-filteredness and the point of every Galois topos
Authors: Eduardo J. Dubuc
Categories: math.CT math.AG
Comments: 5 pages, result presented at CT2007, Cavoeiro
MSC-class: 18B25
\\
  A locally connected topos is a Galois topos if the Galois objects
generate the topos. We show that the full subcategory of Galois objects in
any connected locally connected topos is an inversely 2-filtered
2-category, and as an application of the construction of 2-filtered
bi-limits of topoi, we show that every Galois topos has a point.

			   CALL FOR PAPERS

			      WADT 2008
		    19th International Workshop on
		   Algebraic Development Techniques

		    Pisa, Italy, June 13-16, 2008

	      Home page: http://www.di.unipi.it/wadt2008


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

After having joined forces with CMCS for CALCO'07 in Bergen, WADT
takes place in 2008 as an individual workshop and in its traditional
format.

			    Aims and Scope

The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many
aspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born as
formal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers
new specification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as
object-oriented, aspect-oriented, agent-oriented, logic and
higher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range of
application areas (including information systems, concurrent,
distributed and mobile systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

			  Topics of interest

Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:

 - foundations of algebraic specification
 - other approaches to formal specification, including process calculi
    and models of concurrent, distributed and mobile computing
 - specification languages, methods, and environments
 - semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
 - model-driven development
 - graph transformations, term rewriting and proof systems
 - integration of formal specification techniques
 - formal testing and quality assurance
 - validation and verification

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

		     Workshop Format and Location

The workshop will take place over four days (Friday to Monday) at
Hotel Santa Croce in Fossabanda, a former monastery in the center of
Pisa. It will include presentations selected on the basis of submitted
abstracts as well as three invited talks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

			     Submissions

The scientific programme of the workshop will include presentations of
recent results and ongoing research. The presentations will be
selected by the Steering Committee on the basis of submitted abstracts
according to originality, significance, and general interest.

The abstracts must be up to two pages long including references, and
should be formatted preferably using the standard Springer-Verlag LNCS
style. If a longer version of the contribution is available, it can be
made accessible on the web and referenced in the abstract.

The abstracts have to be submitted electronically via the EasyChair
system, at URL

	 http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=WADT2008.

The final versions of the selected abstracts will be included in a
hand-out for the workshop participants.

After the workshop, selected authors will be invited to submit full
papers for the refereed proceedings, which is expected to be published
as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer Verlag).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

			   Important Dates

April 11, 2008	        Submission deadline for abstracts
April 21, 2008          Notification of acceptance

Dear categorists,

A small category C has finite products just when the
representables in [C^op, Set] are closed under finite
products. It is cartesian closed just when the representables
are closed under finite products and internal hom.

It seems natural, therefore, to consider a notion of
"cartesian closedness without finite products": categories in
which the representables are closed in [C^op, Set] under
internal hom but not necessarily under finite products. This
amounts to giving, for each pair of objects X and Y, an
object [X, Y] together with a universal natural
transformation C(-, [X, Y]) x C(-, X) -> C(-, Y). Such
categories will be closed in the sense of Eilenberg-Kelly
without necessarily being monoidal: let us call them
"universally closed" for now.

Obviously, any cartesian closed category is universally
closed; and categorical proof theory gives us a class of
non-degenerate examples built from the syntax of (classical)
sequent calculi with implication but no product.

The question now arises as to whether there are any
non-syntactic examples of universally closed categories which
are not cartesian closed. The most likely place seems to me
to be domain theory, but I have been unable to track anything
down. Does anyone have any pointers?

Thanks,

Richard.

Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic 87
Honouring the 70th birthday of Anders Kock

Patras, 21-23 March 2008

The 87th Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will be held in Patras,
Greece, on 22-23 March 2008.
An extra session will be held in the afternoon of Friday 21 March,
celebrating the 70th birthday of Anders Kock.
A. Joyal, F. W. Lawvere and G. Reyes will participate honouring Anders.
M. Bunge was kind enough to lead the registered participants list.

A list of participants will appear soon in

http://www.math.upatras.gr/~pssl87/

Accommodation Information:

The University of Patras is located in the suburbs, 10 km NE of the
downtown area.
The participants have the options of either staying downtown or in one
of the hotels along the coast near the University.
In the first case they will have to use local transportation (bus or taxi=
).
In the second case they may choose to walk
(weather permitting) or get a ride by the people involved in the
organization. With the second option in mind, a number of rooms has been
reserved at Hotel Achaia Beach and will be available at the price of 69
Euros (single room)  and 85 Euros (double room), provided that reservatio=
n
is confirmed before 15 January 2008.
The hotel is 2,5 km away from the PSSL venue and has the extra advantage
of being close to some fine restaurants and in walking distance from the
cafes, bars and restaurants of the coast of Rion, which starts getting
lively at that time of the year.
If you wish to book a hotel room yourself you may consult
http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g189488-Patras_Peloponnese-Hotels.html

Transportation Information:

Patras is located 220km W of the Athens airport. The best way to approach
it is to use the Athens Suburban Railway (Proastiakos) which stretches
west up to the town of Kiato, on the northern coast of the Peloponnese,
110km away from Patras. The idea is to arrange some private car or coach
rides from Kiato to Patras, according to the date and time of arrival of
most of you. Otherwise there is the option of getting on the (slow, narro=
w
gauge) train to Patras.

More details will follow in the meeting's webpage.

On reflection, this bit isn't necessarily true, since
EK-closed requires the unit object to be representable as
well.

This is a reasonable requirement anyway,
since the unit is the 0fold iterated hom,
just as it's the 0fold iterated product.
So if you think <closed under binary products>
should be accompanied by <with a unit object>,
then so should <closed under internal homs>.

OTOH, the version without unit probably has some use,
just as non-monoid semigroups occasionally do.

>What is the "0fold iterated" of a non-associative operation?

OK, admittedly it's a bit ambiguous,
and I should not have used the adverb "just".

But given a finite list (X_i : i < n) of n sets (or other objects),
the n-fold iterated hom may be defined by recursion on n as follows:
* The 0fold iterated hom of the empty list is the unit object; and
* the (n + 1)fold iterated hom of the list (X_i : i < n + 1)
  is hom[Y,X_n], where Y is the n-fold iterated hom of (X_i : i < n).
Of course, you might use hom[X_n,Y] instead,
but (even if you change the base case) this will not work.
It would work if you make the 1fold version the base case,
so there are (at least) two notions of iterated hom,
but only one of these has a 0fold case.

If you use exponential notation for the hom,
then the n-fold iterated hom has a well-known notation
$ X_{n-1} ^ {X_{n-2} ^ {X_{n-3} ^ {\rddots ^ {X_2 ^ {X_1 ^ {X_0}}}}}} $
(in TeX, where |rddots| is the reverse of the standard |ddots|).
The version using hom[X_n,Y], although written in a more pleasant order,
required parentheses (or can be rewritten using multiplication).
On the other hand, logicians (using implication for the hom)
require parentheses for my iterated hom.

Note that the 0fold case relies on the property hom[1,X] = X,
so a ~general~ nonassociative operation doesn't have a 0fold iteration.
A nonassociative operation both distinct left and right units
would have two (a priori) equally justified 0fold iterations.

What is the "0fold iterated" of a non-associative operation?

Just a thought that this interest may be more than occasional:
inverse semigroups are closely related to pseudogroups and so are part of
Charles Ehresmann local-to-global view and interests, with a deep relation
to ordered groupoids (see further work by Mark Lawson). So all these partial
units express something on the *local* structure, even if there is a global
unit.  My paper with Aof (based on ideas of Pradines) uses an inverse
semigroup generated by continuous local admissible sections.
(with M. E.-S. A.-F. AOF), ``The holonomy groupoid of a
locally  topological groupoid'', {\em Top. and its  Appl.}, 47 (1992)
97-113.

Is this a rash view that one should look more at inverse categories?

CALL FOR PAPERS

Second Workshop on
MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
6 July 2008,  Reykjavik - Iceland
A satellite workshop of ICALP 2008

PRESENTATION
The workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming is=20
devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a=20
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on=20
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in=20
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of=20
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of remarkable=20
power and abstraction. Monadic programming in Haskell is the=20
paradigmatic example, but there are many more mathematical insights=20
manifest in programs and in programming language design:=20
Freyd-categories in reactive programming, symbolic differentiation=20
yielding context structures, and comonadic presentations of dataflow, to=20
name but three. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to=20
reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.

The first MSFP workshop was held in Kuressaare, Estonia, in July 2006.=20
An associated special issue of the Journal of Functional Programming is=20
in preparation.

SUBMISSIONS
Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science have provisionally=20
agreed to publish the proceedings of MSFP 2008. ENTCS require=20
submissions in LaTeX, formatted according to their guidelines=20
(http://www.entcs.org/prelim.html).

Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted=20
concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. Programme=20
Committee members, barring the co-chairs, may (and indeed are encouraged=20
to) contribute. Accepted papers must be presented at the workshop by one=20
of the authors.

There is no specific page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.

We are using the EasyChair software to manage submissions.
To submit a paper, please log in at:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmsfp2008.

TIMELINE:
Submission of abstracts: 4 April
Submission of papers: 11 April
Notification: 16 May
Final versions due: 13 June
Workshop: 6 July

Dear Ronnie,

This is about your remarks:

 > inverse semigroups are closely related to pseudogroups and so are
part of Charles Ehresmann local-to-global view
 > Is this a rash view that one should look more at inverse categories?

I worked on two subjects where inverse categories are important,
homological algebra and a categorical approach to manifolds - this
second point, of course, agrees with the first citation above, from
your posting.

1. While studying universal models of spectral sequences, in the
70's-80s, I studied inverse categories, as well as a more general
notion, orthodox categories (the analogue of orthodox semigroups, ie
regular semigroups where idempotents are closed under multiplication).

The link comes from the fact that the main theories which produce
spectral sequences (the filtered complex, the double complex,
Massey's exact couple) are 'distributive', in the sense that their
classifying Puppe-exact category E has distributive lattices of
subobjects (notice that this aspect would be lost if one uses the
classifying *abelian* category, since the existence of products
clashes with distributivity). Now, the distributivity of E is
equivalent to the fact that the (involutive) category of relations of
E is orthodox (i.e., idempotent endorelations are closed under
composition), and also to the fact that canonical isomorphisms
between subquotients in E are closed under composition (a crucial
fact when working in homological algebra). Moreover, as an orthodox
category, RelE has a canonical quotient which is an inverse category;
in the latter, the study of subquotients of E is easier. (Notice that
subquotients in E amount to subobjects in RelE, as well as in its
inverse quotient. The first fact was already used in Mac Lane's
'Homology' to define induced homomorphisms; in an abelian context, of
course.)
All this is developed in various papers, but a synopsis can be found
in [1]. Paper [2] shows that every small inverse category can be
embedded in the standard example of inverse categories: sets and
partial bijections (ie, bijections between subsets of domain and
codomain, composed as relations).

2. Inverse categories are of interest when viewing manifolds as
enriched categories, in the line of the well-known Lawvere's paper on
metric spaces. More generally, the procedure works for 'glueing
structures', defined by glueing elementary ones: manifolds, fibre
bundles, foliations...

Here, the basic inverse category for manifolds is the category C of
open subspaces of all euclidean spaces, with partial homeomorphisms
(or diffeomorphisms) between open subsets of domain and codomain. A
manifold is then defined replacing the usual atlas of charts U_i -->
R^n with the 'glueing atlas' of such partial bijections U_i --> U_j.
This atlas is, in a sense to be made precise, a category enriched
over C - as an involutive ordered category endowed with further
structure. The underlying topological space is recovered as a lax
colimit. See [3, 4].

RUSSELL'08 - PROOF THEORY MEETS TYPE THEORY
  A "Small Workshop" of the European TYPES Project
  Call for Participation and Contributed Talks
  Swansea, Wales, 15-16 March 2008
  http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csetzer/russell08/index.html
* In 1908 the British Philosopher and Mathematician Bertrand Russell,
  who was born and died in Wales, published the article "Mathematical
  Logic as based on the Theory of Types" which contained a first
  matured exposition of Type Theory.  In the same year, Ernst Zermelo's
  "Untersuchungen ueber die Grundlagen der Mengenlehre I" introduced
  the basis of current axiomatic set theory as an alternative
  approach to the foundations of Mathematics.
  A central theme of Proof Theory is to compare these different
  foundations.  Proof Theory uses as its main tool ordinal notation
  systems, the basis of which was laid by Oswald Veblen in his paper
  "Continuous Increasing Functions of Finite and Transfinite
  Ordinals", again in 1908.
  A century later, Proof Theory and Type Theory are flourishing more
  than ever before, and their manifold interconnections are driving
  important developments in Mathematics and Computer Science.
  At this workshop we meet and discuss cutting edge research at the
  interface of Proof Theory and Type Theory.
* Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
  Proof Theory of Type Theory;  Relationship between Type Theory and
  Set Theory; Program extraction from proofs; Normalisation and
  Cut-elimination; New approaches to ordinal analysis Universes and
  reflection principles;  Equality in Type Theory; Philosophical and
  historical aspects of Proof Theory and Type Theory
* Invited Speakers: To be confirmed.
* Participation and Contributed Talks:
  Please send an email to Anton Setzer (a.g.setzer@swansea.ac.uk)
  as soon as possible, but no later than the 29th of February 2008.


WORKSHOP ON MODAL FIXPOINT LOGICS

  March 25-27, Amsterdam, the Netherlands
  Organizers: Luigi Santocanale and Yde Venema.
* The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers from
  various
  backgrounds, in particular, computer scientists and pure logicians,
  in order to discuss modal fixpoint logics from various perspectives,
  including those of model theory, proof theory, algebra and duality,
  and automata theory.
* Deadline for submission of contributed papers: February 1, 2008.
* Invited speakers: Giovanna D'Agostino, Johan van Benthem, Marcello
  Bonsangue, Dietmar Berwanger,  Erich Graedel (to be confirmed),
  Dexter Kozen (to be confirmed), Giacomo Lenzi, Damian Niwinski,
  Colin Stirling, Thomas Studer, Albert Visser, Igor Walukiewicz,
  and Thomas Wilke (to be confirmed).

  University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
* We are proud to announce a joint CSF/LICS invited speaker: David
  Basin.
* New theoretical results in computer security are welcome. Also welcome
  are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open questions
  and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories. Panel
  proposals are sought as well as papers. Possible topics include, but
  are not limited to:
  - Access control
  - Anonymity and Privacy
  - Authentication
  - Data and system integrity
  - Database security

AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
  Call for Papers
  July 28-31, 2008, Urbana, Illinois, United States
  http://amast08.cs.uiuc.edu
* The major goal of the AMAST conferences is to promote research
  towards setting software technology on a firm, mathematical basis.
  Work towards this goal is a collaborative, international effort
  with contributions from both academia and industry. The envisioned
  virtues of providing software technology developed on a mathematical
  basis include: correctness, which can be proved mathematically;
  safety, so that developed software can be used in the implementation

  platforms and language generations; and evolutionary change, i.e.,
  the software is self-adaptable and evolves with the problem domain.
* Topics of interest include: systems software technology;
  application software technology; concurrent and reactive systems;
  formal methods in industrial software development; formal techniques
  for software requirements, design; evolutionary software/adaptive
  systems; logic programming, functional programming, object
  paradigms;
  constraint programming and concurrency; program verification and
  transformation; programming calculi; specification languages and
  tools; formal specification and development case studies; logic,
  category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra; algebraic
  foundations for languages and systems, coinduction; theorem proving
  and logical frameworks for reasoning; logics of programs; algebra
  and coalgebra. For system demonstrations or ordinary papers:
  software development environments; support for correct software
  development; system support for reuse; tools for prototyping;
  component based software development tools; validation and
  verification; computer algebra systems; theorem proving systems.
* Important dates: Abstract submission due: 1 March 2008;
  Paper submission due: 8 March 2008; Notification: 20 April 2008



19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONCURRENCY THEORY (CONCUR 08)
  Call for Papers
  Toronto, Canada, August 19-22, 2008
  http://www.cse.yorku.ca/concur08
* Submission deadline: April 11, 2008
* CONCUR 08, the 19th International Conference on Concurrency Theory,
  will take place in Toronto, Canada, on August 19-22, 2008.  The
  purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together researchers,
  developers, and students in order to advance the theory of
  concurrency, and promote its applications (in a broad sense).
* CONCUR 08 will be collocated with the 27th Annual ACM SIGACT-SIGOPS
  Symposium on the Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC 2008).
  Furthermore, there will be a symposium celebrating the contributions
  of Nancy Lynch and a number of workshops on topics related to CONCUR
  and PODC.  The overall event will take place at the University of
  Toronto on August 17-24, 2008.
* CONCUR 08 welcomes two categories of papers:
  - regular papers;
  - tool papers.
* Submissions are solicited in all areas of semantics, logics,
  verification and analysis of concurrent systems.  The principal
  topics include (but are not limited to):
  - basic models of concurrency (such as abstract machines, domain
    theoretic models, game theoretic models, process algebras, and
    Petri nets);
  - logics for concurrency (such as modal logics, temporal logics and
    resource logics);
  - models of specialized systems (such as biology-inspired systems,
    circuits, hybrid systems, mobile systems, multi-core processors,
    probabilistic systems, real time systems, synchronous systems, and
    web services);
  - verification and analysis techniques for concurrent systems (such
    as abstract interpretation, atomicity checking, model-checking,
    race detection, run-time verification, state-space exploration,
    static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem proving and type
    systems);
  - related programming models (such as distributed or object-oriented).

Any geometric morphism of triposes f: P -> Q can be lifted to a
geometric morphism of toposes  [f]:  C[P]  ->  C[Q]. It can also be
shown that if f is an inclusion then [f] is also an inclusion.
My question is the following:
Suppose f: P -> Q is connected (i.e., the inverse image f^* is fully
faithful, or equivalently, the unit \eta: Id => f_*f^* is an iso),
is [f]: C[P] -> C[Q] then also connected?

INTRODUCTION

    The Workshop on Domains is aimed at computer scientists and
     mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
     foundations of computation. The workshop will focus on
     domains, their applications and related topics.  Previous meetings
     were held in Darmstadt (94,99,04), Braunschweig (96),
     Munich (97), Siegen (98), Birmingham (02) and Novosibirsk (07).

FORMAT

    The emphasis is on the exchange of ideas between participants
    similar in style to Dagstuhl seminars.  In particular, talks on
subjects
    presented at other conferences and workshops are acceptable.

INVITED SPEAKERS (confirmed)

    Jean Goubault-Larrecq   LSV/ENS Cachan & CNRS
    Martin Hyland		        Cambridge University
    John Longley			University of Edinburgh
    Andrew Pitts 			Cambridge University

   More invited speakers to be announced soon!

SCOPE

     Domain theory has had applications to programming language
     semantics and logics (lambda-calculus, PCF, LCF), recursion theory
     (Kleene-Kreisel countable functionals), general topology
     (injective spaces, function spaces, locally compact spaces, Stone
     duality), topological algebra (compact Hausdorff semilattices) and
     analysis (measure, integration, dynamical systems). Moreover,
     these applications are related - for example, Stone duality gives
     rise to a logic of observable properties of computational
     processes.

     As such, domain theory is highly interdisciplinary. Topics of
     interaction with domain theory for this workshop include, but are
     not limited to:

       program semantics
       program logics
       probabilistic computation
       exact computation over the real numbers
       lambda calculus
       games
       models of sequential computation
       constructive mathematics
       recursion theory
       realizability
       real analysis and computability
       topology, metric spaces and domains
       locale theory
       category theory
       topos theory
       type theory


SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS

     One-page abstracts need to be submitted to

                   domains9@sussex.ac.uk

     Shortly after an abstract is submitted (usually two or three
weeks),
     the authors will be notified by the programme committee. The
     criterion for acceptance is relevance to the meeting. In
     particular, talks on subjects presented at other conferences and
     workshops are acceptable.

DEADLINE

     Abstracts will be dealt with on a first-come/first-served basis.
     We expect potential speakers to express the intention to give
     a talk by the end of June.

REGISTRATION

     Further details about the local arrangements will be provided soon.

ACCOMMODATION

    The workshop will be held at the University of Sussex at Falmer,
    Brighton (UK). Newly built halls of residence will be available to
    workshop participants.   Further information on travel,
    accommodation and places of local interest will be announced
    closer to the workshop.

ANNOUNCEMENT/CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS:

---------------------------------------

Joint  International  Workshop  on:

QUANTUM PHYSICS AND LOGIC (QPL'08)
DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPUTATIONAL MODELS (DCM'08)
July 12-13, 2008, Reykjavik, Iceland.

http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/bob.coecke/DCM_QPL_08.html

---------------------------------------

This to ICALP 2008 affiliated joint event combines two (established) workshop series:

QUANTUM PHYSICS AND LOGIC (QPL'08): This event has as its goal to bring
together researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum
computing and the use of logical tools, new structures, formal languages,
semantical  methods and other computer science methods for the study
quantum behaviour in general.  Over the past couple of years there has
been a growing activity in these foundational approaches together with a
renewed interest in the foundations of quantum theory, which complement
the more mainstream research in quantum  computation.  A predecessor of
this event, with the same acronym, called Quantum Programming Languages,
was held in  Ottawa (2003),  Turku (2004),  Chicago (2005) and Oxford
(2006); with the change of name and a new program committee we wish to
emphasise the intended much broader scope of this event, aiming to nourish
interaction between modern computer science logic, quantum computation and
information, and structural foundations for quantum physics.

DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPUTATIONAL MODELS (DCM'08):  Besides quantum computing,
several  new  models  of computation have emerged in the last few years,
and many developments of traditional computational models have been
proposed with the aim of taking into account the new demands of computer
systems users and the new capabilities of computation engines. A new
computational model, or a new feature in a traditional one, usually is
reflected in new structural paradigms.  The aim of this workshop is to
bring together researchers who are currently developing new computational
models or new features for traditional computational models, in order to
foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and
work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current
activities in this area.  Previous editions in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were
also affiliated to ICALP.

Invited speakers:

Terry Rudolph (Imperial College London)
TBA

Programme Committee:

Howard Barnum (Los Alamos)
Dan Browne (University College London)
Bob Coecke (Oxford) Co-Chair
Vincent Danos (Paris VII)
Andreas Doering (Imperial College London)
Annick Lesne (IHS Paris)
Ian Mackie (Sussex)
Prakash Panangaden (McGill) Co-Chair
Jon Yard (Los Alamos)

Dates:

- Submission deadline: March 31
- Acceptance/rejection notification: April 21
- Pre-proceedings versions due: June 15
- Workshop: July 12-13 2007

Submission format:

Prospective speakers are invited to submit a 2-5 pages abstract which
provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest and provides
sufficient detail to allows the program  committee to assess the merits of
the work.  Submissions of works in progress are encouraged but must be
more substantial than a research proposal.  We both encourage submissions
of original research as well as research submitted elsewhere.  Authors of
accepted original research contributions will be invited to submit a full
paper to a special issue of a journal yet to be decided on.  Submissions
should be in Postscript or PDF format and should be sent to Bob Coecke
<coecke@comlab.ox.ac.uk> by  March 15.  Receipt of all submissions will be
acknowledged by return email. Accepted contributors will be able to
publish extended versions of their abstracts in Electronic Notes in
Theoretical Computer Science.

Financial support. The workshop enjoys support from:
EPSRC Network Semantics of Quantum Computation (EP/E006833/1)
EPSRC ARF The Structure of Quantum Information and its Applications to IT (EP/D072786/1)

[Apologies for multiple copies - please forward to interested candidates]

Applications are invited for a Research Associate to work on the FP6-IST
project  SENSORIA. The overall aim of the project is to develop a
comprehensive approach to the engineering of software systems for the
emerging Service-Oriented Computing paradigm, integrating foundational
theories, techniques, and methods, as well as a pragmatic software
engineering approach.

The post is available within WP7 to support the development and
verification of service-oriented systems by means of automated,
verifiable transformations. Applicants should have completed or be
nearing completion of a PhD in Computer Science or a related subject,
and be in possession of a good background in graph transformations,
their verification and implementation, and their application to model
transformations. Some knowledge of logic and algebraic specification
techniques is desirable.

The post is for one year, but likely to be extended by a further six
months. Closing Date for applications is 8 February 2008.

Please find further details at

NASA Langley/NIA Formal Methods Team invites you to submit an abstract
and/or register to attend:

     The Sixth NASA Langley Formal Methods Workshop
                       LFM 2008
    http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/LFM2008/LFM2008.html

                April 30 - May 2, 2008
                Newport News, Virginia


--------------------------------------------------
Important Deadlines:
--------------------------------------------------

Abstract Submissions for Contributed Talks: March 1, 2008
Acceptance: March 15, 2008
Registration: April 15, 2008


--------------------------------------------------
Theme of Conference:
--------------------------------------------------

Safety critical systems represent an ever-increasing problem domain,
challenging verification techniques to catch up. Within the field of
aeronautics alone, we find the need for verification of algorithms for
separation assurance, air traffic control, auto-pilot, Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), adaptive avionics, automated decision authority, and
much more. Recent advances in formal methods have made verifying more of
these problems realistic. Thus we need to continually re-assess what we
can solve now and identify the next barriers to overcome. Only through
an exchange of ideas between theoreticians and practitioners from
academia to industry can we extend formal methods for the verification
of ever more challenging problem domains.

The goal of this workshop on formal methods for verification is to
examine formal verification techniques, their theory, application areas,
current capabilities, and limitations. This format is designed to
introduce researchers, graduate students, and partners in industry to
those topics that are of fundamental interest and importance, to survey
current research, and to discuss major unsolved problems and directions
for future research.

The meeting will be comprised of invited talks covering the major
research areas, and more specialized contributed talks, including
student talks. Contributed talks will consist of 30-minute research
expositions providing state-of-the-art information on recent
developments related to formal methods, and a number of 15-minute talks
on current research given by undergraduate and graduate students.


--------------------------------------------------
Topics of Interest:
--------------------------------------------------

Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:

    * advances in formal verification techniques
    * formal models of distributed computing
    * planning and scheduling
    * automated air traffic management
    * fault tolerance
    * hybrid systems/hybrid automata
    * embedded systems
    * safety critical applications
    * safety cases
    * accident/safety analysis


--------------------------------------------------
Invited Tutorials:
--------------------------------------------------

    * Gerard J. Holzmann (NASA JPL) - On Limits
    * John Rushby (SRI) - Formal Methods and Certification
    * Moshe Y. Vardi (Rice University) - From Philosophical to
Industrial Logics


--------------------------------------------------
Submissions:
--------------------------------------------------

There are two categories of submissions:

    * Regular Talks. These talks will be 30 minutes in length, including
questions.
    * Student Talks. These talks will be 15 minutes in length, including
questions.

Both categories of talks will be selected from the abstracts submitted
to the LFM 2008 web site.


--------------------------------------------------
Location and Cost:
--------------------------------------------------

The workshop will take place at the Marriott Hotel, City Center at
Oyster Point, Newport News, Virginia, USA. Information on hotel block
reservations and travel are located on the LFM 2008 web site. Note that
hotel reservations at the special block rate must be made on or before
30 March 2008.

There will be no registration fee charged to participants. All
interested individuals, including non-US citizens, are welcome to
attend, to listen to the talks, and to participate in discussions.
However, all attendees must register. We especially encourage students
and other researchers possibly interested in specializing in formal
methods to attend as this will be a good opportunity to become more
knowledgeable about this area of research.

Dear all,

By exploring the Math Reviews, I found by chance a paper constructing for any
reasonable (semi)topological category a closed monoidal structure.
Unfortunately, I cannot refind this paper and I cannot remember the keywords
I used. Could you help me please ??

Thanks in advance. pg.

Two names come to my mind in this context: Juraj Cincura and Georg
Greve, but I have no time to check the details.

Dear all,

I thank you very much for all the answers. I am going to read all these
papers. But maybe it is simpler to explain my problem:

Consider Theorem 27.22 of the book "The joy of cats"
<http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/17/tr17abs.html> : a
well-fibered topological construct is cartesian closed iff for any object A,
Ax- preserves colimits. Does this theorem have a generalization for other
symmetric monoidal structures than the binary product ?

Thanks in advance. pg.

Street and Walters (1973) called a category A total when its Yoneda
embedding has a left adjoint and proved that such a category is compact
in the sense of Isbell, that is: every functor F: A --> B preserving all
colimits has a right adjoint (some provisions on the size of hom sets
need to be made). There are many papers on the fairly rich supply of
total categories, by Wood (1982) and myself with B"orger (1990) and
Adamek (1990), and by others. There is also paper dealing specifically
with compact categories, by B"orger, Tholen, Wischnewsky and Wolff (JPAA
21 (1981) 129-144). Theorem 4.1 of that paper says explicitly:

Let P: A --> X be a semitopological functor over a compact category X.
Then a  monoidal structure on A is closed if and only if A \ten (-)
preserves all colimits.

The reason of course is that semitopological functors "lift" compactness
(and so do monadic functors - Rattray 1975). The theorem below gives
extra conditions to make sure that preservation of small colimits
suffices. There is a lot more literature on that latter aspect,
particularly by Kelly.
