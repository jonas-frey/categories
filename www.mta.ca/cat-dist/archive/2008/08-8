Hi,

Category theoretic notions such as sum and colimit can be thought of
as generalizations of the elementary arithmetic operation of adding
numbers. Given that place-value notation is the syntax (in the sense
of underlying structure or format) of addition, is there a category
theoretic account of place-value notation?

thank you,
posina

It's (more or less) present in the long Fourman--Scott paper on
sheaves and logic in SLN 753 (the Proceedings of the 1977 Durham
symposium), but they don't claim originality for it.

The result was in the air - and I'm sure that Joyal in particular saw
it clearly.

For me it (or at least the logical version of it given in Fourman-
Scott) came as an answer to Dana's request for a description of an
internal cHa in a category of "Omega sets". I don't think I had
already heard it from Joyal - but I'm sure he already knew it. It was
easy to see that an object of Loc/Omega represented an internal cHa,
by generalisation of the representation of examples such as the
internal cHa O(R) in Sh(X) as O(RxX) -> O(X), or relaxation of the
representation of sheaves by local homeomorphisms.

Our paper was deliberately (and perhaps mistakenly) concrete rather
than abstract, so we didn't think to phrase the representation
explicitly as an equivalence of categories.

A related (but even more logical and obstinately pointed) result is
given in
Michael P. Fourman. T1 spaces over topological sites. J. Pure and
Applied Algebra, 27(3):223-224, March 1983.

Dear Categoreans,

I know three monoidal structures on the category of sets, all of them
symmetric. Two are the product and coproduct, and I'll leave it to
your imagination to figure out the third one.

My question is: are these the only three? Proofs, counterexamples, or
references appreciated.

Thanks, -- Peter

I've been thinking idly about a concept dual to categories
in much the same way that co-algebras are dual to algebras,
and I've decided that I'd like to more about it.
To be precise, if V is a monoidal category,
then a category enriched over V has maps [A,B] (x) [B,C] -> [A,C],
while a cocategory enriched over V has maps [A,C] -> [A,B] (x) [B,C].
(You can fill in the rest of the definition for yourself.)

Searching Google, this concept appears to be known (under this name)
in the case where V is Abelian, but I'm not so interested in that.
I'm more interested in the case where V is a pretopos (like Set)
equipped with the coproduct (disjoint union) as the monoidal structure (x).
My motivation is that this concept is important in constructive analysis
when V is a Heyting algebra equipped with disjunction as (x).
(This defines a V-valued apartness relation on the set of objects;
but I'm stating even this fact in more generality than I've ever seen.)

So if anyone has heard of this concept where V is not assumed abelian,
or even knows of a good introduction where V is assumed abelian,
then I would be interested in references.

Dear Peter,

There's a paper=20

Algebraic categories with few monoidal biclosed structures or none

of Foltz, Lair, and Kelly which studies monoidal closed structures on =
various
categories, and shows that the cartesian closed one is the only =
possibility for Set.
More generally, it shows that for many categories we know well, the only =
possible
monoidal closed structures are the ones we know well.

But this depends heavily on the closedness. Without that, as you say, =
one can use
the cocartesian monoidal structure (the coproduct).=20

Here's a further infinite family of monoidal structures on Set. Let A be =
any set. Then=20
define the tensor product * by X*Y=3DAXY+X+Y.

Steve.

My self-published advanced undergraduate algebra  text
"Introductory Algebra, Topology, and Category Theory"
has been  available by mail order since mid-2006.  Recently I have made
it  available at "_www.amazon.com_ (http://www.amazon.com) ".  Also,  it has
received a favorable
review from the MAA online reviews ("_www.maa.org/reviews_
(http://www.maa.org/reviews) ").

This text is currently the only one available which covers such a
wide  range of material in a single volume.  It is ideally suited for a
number  of uses, including as a supplementary text for any undergraduate
algebra  course.  The MAA review recommends it as a second text in
algebra for  students interested in mathematics.

The table of contents and first chapter may be viewed at
"_www.hyperonsoft.com_ (http://www.hyperonsoft.com) ".

Dear Toby,

What you call a cocategory enriched over V can also be
described as a category enriched over V^op. These have been
studied by Paddy McCrudden in his thesis under the name
"coalgebroids" (= many-object coalgebras). The main results
are on a generalised notion of Tannakian duality; and on
transfer of extra structure across this duality. See
respectively:

[1] Paddy McCrudden, Categories of Representations of Coalgebroids,
Advances in Mathematics Volume 154, Issue 2, Pages 299-332

[2] Paddy McCrudden, Balanced Coalgebroids
Theory and Applications of Categories, Vol. 7, pp 71-147.

Several people took up the challenge, and provided me with interesting
monoidal structures on Set. I'll briefly summarize the correct
responses that I have received.

Let me begin by revealing the "third" monoidal structure that I had in
mind. It is

 X*Y = XY + X + Y.                                          (1)

It is easy to see that this satisfies the axioms if one rewrites it,
by an abuse of notation, as

 X*Y = (X+1)(Y+1) - 1.

Steve Lack pointed out that this is part of an infinite family of
monoidal structures, each defined by

 X*Y = XSY + X + Y,                                         (2)

where S is some fixed set. Of course, for S=0 this is just the
coproduct, and for S=1, this is the same as (1).

In the case |S| > 1, coherence is not totally obvious; in fact, there
are two possible natural isomorphisms (X*Y)*Z -> X*(Y*Z), deriving
from the two natural maps from S^2 to itself. Only one of them is
coherent. The coherence proof is somewhat simpler if one writes (2)
in the form I have given, rather than in Steve's original form
SXY + X + Y.

It is interesting to note that, contrary to appearances, Steve's
monoidal structure is not symmetric (not even braided) for |S| > 1.
There is only one candidate braiding map X*Y -> Y*X, and it fails to
satisfy the hexagon axiom.

Ralph Loader proposed another monoidal structure, not contained in
Steve's family: let X*Y be the set of non-empty finite sequences in
X+Y, with no two consecutive elements from the same component of X+Y.
Using the Kleene star, this can be written as

 X*Y = (XY)^* (X+XY) + (YX)^* (Y+YX).                       (3)

(Here, A^* is the list monad, i.e., the initial solution for
A^* = 1 + A A^*, also known as the Kleene star).

After Ralph saw Steve's family, he noticed that his construction can
also be generalized to an infinite family, by alternating list
elements with elements of S, namely:

 X*Y = (XSYS)^* (X+XSY) + (YSXS)^* (Y+YSX).                 (4)

The case S=0 is again the coproduct, and the case S=1 is of course
(3). Unlike Steve's family, these tensors appear to be symmetric for
all S. Also unlike Steve's family, the construction does not restrict
to the category of finite sets.

Jeff Egger contributed another symmetric monoidal structure, which he
calls "par", and which is defined by:

 X*Y = X   if Y=0
 X*Y = Y   if X=0                                           (5)
 X*Y = 1   if both X and Y are non-empty.

This can be uniquely extended to morphisms such that f*0 = f = 0*f.

It is perhaps interesting to note that an attempt to make Jeff's
construction into an infinite family, by replacing "1" by some pointed
set S, *almost* succeeds: the resulting operation is functorial, with
coherent associativity and unit isomorphism. The only problem is that
associativity fails to be a natural transformation. I mention it here
because it might make for a really neat exercise in a course.


In summary, we have two infinite families (2) and (4) (both including
coproduct), plus product and Jeff's "par" (5). I admit that I did not
expect so many non-trivial monoidal structures to exist on Set, and I
now expect that there are many more. A complete classification would
be interesting, but is perhaps too much to expect.

I will close with another challenge: consider only *symmetric*
monoidal structures on the category of *finite* sets. So far, we have
seen four such structures, namely product, coproduct, and the tensors
(1) and (5). Are these the only four?

-- Peter

P.S. monoidal *closed* structures, as mentioned in Steve's message,
are an entirely different ball game. The requirement that tensor is
left adjoint implies that it preserves colimits in each components; on
Set, everything is therefore determined by 1*1. The only possibility
is 1*1=1, which yields the usual cartesian-closed structure.

As some of you know, my wife and I are translating Grothendieck's
Tohoku paper.  Originally, it was suggested that it be published as a
TAC reprint, but Grothendieck refuses permission because he "does not
believe in copyright".  So I thought to retype it and post it on my own
site (so sue).   I then realized that translation would be easier than
retyping.

Which brings me to a translation problem.  I am not expert in spectral
sequences and what I know is from Cartan-Eilenberg.  I cannot related
G's definition to theirs.  G defines a spectral sequence as a pair
E=(E^{p,q}_r,E^n), all indexed objects of an abelian category subject to
five conditions.  The first three refer only to the E^{p,q}_r, including
that for each pair p,q the E^{p,q}_r stabilize vis-vis r to a term he
calls E^{p,q}_\infty (and not E^{p,q}).  The fourth assumes
"isomorphisms $\beta^{p,q}:E^{pq}\to G^p(E^{p+q})$.  The family $(E^n)$
without filtrations is called the \emph{l'aboutissement} of the spectral
sequence $E$."  The E^n are assumed filtered and G^p is the associated
grading:  G^p(A)=F^p(A)/F^{p-1}(A).  Now this makes no sense.  The only
thing called E^{pq} would be the term E^n for n=pq and this is really
unlikely.  I strongly suspect the domain of \beta^{p,q} is intended to
be E^{p,q}_\infty.  Finally does anyone have any idea how
"aboutissement" is to be translated.  It means something like limit, but
the usual term for that is of course "limite".  The Cartan-Eilenberg
development is different enough that there seems not to be any
corresponding word.

In my review of Anders Kock's Synthetic

Bill,

    Happy to see you contributing to the renaissance in interest in
Chen's work.

It would be good to post your msg to the n-category cafe blog
whee there's been an intense discussion of `smooth spaces' i various
incarnaitons.

That seems to be the translation of the word, thanks to several.  That
still leaves that mysterious E^{pq} ---> G^p(E^{p+q}) to correct, since I
do not believe that it is correct as stands.

Hi -

Bill Lawvere mentioned that KT Chen had a cartesian closed category
of smooth spaces.  I've found this very useful in my work on geometry.
I kept wanting more properties of this category, so finally my student
Alex Hoffnung and I wrote a paper about it:

Convenient Categories of Smooth Spaces
http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1704

Abstract: A "Chen space" is a set X equipped with a collection of
"plots" - maps from convex sets to X - satisfying three simple
axioms. While an individual Chen space can be much worse than a
smooth manifold, the category of all Chen spaces is much better
behaved than the category of smooth manifolds.  For example, any
subspace or quotient space of a Chen space is a Chen space, and
the space of smooth maps between Chen spaces is again a Chen space.
Souriau's "diffeological spaces" share these convenient properties.
Here we give a unified treatment of both formalisms. Following ideas
of Dubuc, we show that Chen spaces, diffeological spaces, and even
simplicial complexes are examples of "concrete sheaves on a concrete
site". As a result, the categories of such spaces are locally
cartesian closed, with all limits, all colimits, and a weak subobject
classifier. For the benefit of differential geometers, our treatment
explains most of the category theory we use.

In particular, at some point we break down and admit we're dealing
with a "quasitopos".

Best,
jb

I was expecting Peter Lumsdaine to reply to this, but perhaps he's away.

In discussions with Steve Awodey and myself, Peter recently established
the fact that every co-category in a pretopos is a co-equivalence
relation; more specifically, the "co-domain" and "co-codomain" maps
(sorry, but I can't see any other way to describe them) are the
cokernel pair of a (unique) monomorphism (namely, their equalizer).

I suggest to Michael Barr to send the whole  sentence where it is found
the word "aboutissement",  and ask for a translation  of the sentence.
He will get a better  english version that just a rendering into english
of that word.

May be the natural 21 century mathematical english version of the french
sentence will not even use the word "abutment".

Well Michael, I do not have at hand your original post. What I do remember of
that post is that you ask for an english translation of the word
"aboutissement", not for a translation a whole sentence containing that word.

In my whole experience reading mathematics written in english, I do not
remember to have seen the word "abutment".

On the other hand, I am tired of reading spanish translations (from english or
french or russian) of mathematical texts where single words are replaced by
their spanish translations, and the result is completely alien to standard
mathematical spanish.

Does the word "abutment" belong to standard mathematical english ?

Eduardo.

Well, I read my email backwards, so after my previous post I came into an
email that it is certainly useful to many, including myself and Michael. This
email tels me that "abutment" is the standard mathematical english version of
the french word in the spectral sequence context
as in

Dear all,

> That seems to be the translation [abutment] of the word, thanks to seve=
ral.

Just a remark about "abutment": it translates the French "aboutement", wi=
th a rather different meaning than "aboutissement".  The latter is closer=
 to the "ending" (of some process; with possibly a little shade of "fatal=
ity" in it).

The two words are related, and I don't know whether the mathematical idea=
 behind makes "abutment" good, or even better, but I just wanted to menti=
on the difference.

Dear Categorists -

Given a category C with pullbacks we can define a bicategory Span(C)
where objects are objects of C, morphisms are spans - composed
using pullback - and 2-morphisms are maps between spans.

Have people tried to categorify this yet?

Suppose we have a 2-category C with pseudo-pullbacks.  Then we should
be able to define a tricategory Span(C).   Has someone done this?

Or maybe people have gotten some partial results, e.g. in the case
where C = Cat.  I'd like to know about these!

Best,
jb

Dear Categorists -

I know someone who needs to construct a "biadjoint biequivalence"
between bicategories, and is not relishing the task.

If somebody was trying to construct an adjoint equivalence between
categories, and was not relishing the task, I might suggest that they
construct an equivalence, and then use the theorem that any equivalence
can be improved to an adjoint equivalence.

Has someone proved that any biequivalence between bicategories
can be improved to a biadjoint biequivalence?

Best,
jb

Hi John,

Answers to both this and your previous question about biadjoint
biequivalences are at least asserted in Street's "Fibrations in
Bicategories".

At the end of section 1, he defines a functor (=homomorphism) to have a
left biadjoint if each object has a left bilifting, to be a biequivalence
if it is biessentially surjective and locally fully faithful, and states
that "clearly a biequivalence T has a left biadjoint S which is also a
biequivalence".

At the beginning of section 3 he defines a bicategory of spans from A to
B in any bicategory, and given finite bilimits, essentially describes
how to construct what one might call an "unbiased tricategory" of spans
(of course, the definition of tricategory didn't exist at the time).

He doesn't give any details of the proofs, but one could probably
construct a detailed proof from these ideas without much more than
tedium.  I don't know whether anyone has written them out.

Best,
Mike

Not a single abutment in any of the following YouTube videos posted by
their proud aboutisseurs.

http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=aboutissement&search_type=

Evidently G needed a word with the sense of "limit" or "completion" that
didn't overload terms that already had technical meanings in that
context while itself having a technical ring to it, which
"aboutissement" seems to do nicely in French.  Something like "terminus"
might serve this purpose in English.

An abutment is an engineering construct for butting two things together,
often in the context of bridges, whether over a river or between teeth,
and seems quite unsuitable for this purpose.

I thought the references I sent showed it is indeed standard
mathematical english
at least for those who speak the subdialect of spectral sequences
even more common is the construction

Hi all,

Can someone please point me to whatever categorical references exist
regarding the canonical trace for dualizable objects in a symmetric
monoidal category?  I am particularly interested in (1) elementary
expositions accessible to non-category-theorists and (2) any proofs of
its uniqueness subject to various conditions.

I know there are many references on traced monoidal categories,
particularly with applications to computer science, but right now I am
only interested in the symmetric monoidal trace.  I also know that
there are various reinventions/expositions of the notion in, for
example, the topological literature (e.g. Dold-Puppe), but I would
like an exposition not tied to any particular application.  Finally, I
know that the Joyal-Street-Verity paper "Traced Monoidal Categories"
proves that the canonical symmetric (or, more precisely, balanced)
monoidal trace is "universal" in that any traced monoidal category can
be embedded in one equipped with the canonical trace, but as far as I
can tell this need not determine the canonical trace uniquely.

Thanks!!
Mike

Yes, it does.  Googling "abutment spectral sequence" makes this
abundantly clear.

I agree with Vaughan.

Further, I have the feeling that "abutment" is not the appropriate way of
rendering into mathematical english the meaning of the word
"aboutissement" as it was used by Grothendieck.

I repeat, we should analyse the whole french sentence to come up with a
good translation.

Is it not possible that somebody (not very versant in either french or
english) had first the need to translate Grothendieck's "aboutissement",
and unlike Michael Barr who asked advise, just  came up  with "abutment"
(out of some dictionary).

and then, other people  (also not very good at either french or english)
in the same area just keep copying him  and each other?

and generated the whole cascade coming out of google . . .

who is to blame for the first use of "abutment" for Grothendieck's
"aboutissement" in mathematical english  ?   ja !!!

are we all going to follow ?

 I will be the first to use "abutment" if the word has a long tradition,
and some prestigious mathematicians have used it.

I finish with a question:  Is it the case here ?

One amusing thing about the tricategory of spans in a
2-category, with composition by iso-comma object, is that it
is barely a tricategory. Binary composition is associative up
to iso; it is only the unitality which is really up to
equivalence. Something similar happens if you define a
tricategory of biprofunctors.

Hello,
 	Details of a part of John and Mike's post can be found in one of
my publications.

Theorem. 9.17
Let X and A be strict 2-categories, and G:A -> X a pseudo functor. There
exists a left biadjoint for G if and only if for every object x of X there
exists an object r of A and a biuniversal arrow x -> Gr from x to G.

The proof is as one could expect.

Of course this begs the obvious question, how hard is this to generalise =
to
bicategories?

I'm surprised no-one has mentioned Gurksi's thesis, which I just came acr=
oss.
Appendix A has details of adjunctions in bicategories, and biadjunctions =
in
tricategories, citing Verity's thesis in the case of Gray-categories.

Best,

David

I admit I don't recall abutment
but abutting has a long history in spec sequence jargon
the idea I think was that the spectral sequence runs to/
buts up against the E\infty term or is it to the object
of which E\infty is the associated graded?

sorry it's been so long...

I am NOT about to change a word that has apparently existed for over 50
years just because it is not particularly meaningful.  Does "ring", which
originally referred to Z/nZ, still have any connection with the notion?
How about "field" or as the French and Germans call them "body" have any
connection with fields.  The worst thing is to create a fork in the
language.  I have my own idea on what a better word would be but I'll be
damned if I state it in a public forum.  Anyway, I gather that
Grothendieck's definition is hardly used today.

It is interesting that the less important question (and ultimately
unimportant) question has flooded the list, while the serious one (what
was Grothendieck's supposed to be) has been ignored.  I have no
suggestion, save my own, for what definition was actually intended.

Dear Mike,

I don't know whether the proof of this result is spelled out in the
literature (uniqueness of the trace for dualizable objects in a
symmetric monoidal category). However, I have seen the result itself
mentioned, and it follows straightforwardly from Joyal-Street-Verity's
INT construction.

As you have already said, every traced symmetric monoidal category C
can be embedded in a compact closed category INT(C), in such a way
that the trace of C is mapped to the canonical trace of
INT(C). Further, every strong monoidal functor preserves dual objects,
so if some object X of C has a "canonical" trace coming from a dual
object, then this also gets mapped to the canonical trace of INT(C).
Finally, since the functor is faithful, and maps the "given" and the
"canonical" trace to the same thing, it follows that the two traces
already coincide in C. The same argument works for balanced monoidal
categories.

One can easily turn this argument into an elementary algebraic
proof. For an object X equipped with two traces Tr and Tr', consider
the following "interchange property" for f: A*X*X -> B*X*X:

Tr'_X(Tr_X(f o (A*c))) = Tr_X(Tr'_X((B*c) o f))

See Figure (a) in the attached file for an illustration of this
property. It is akin to "symmetry sliding", except that it uses two
different traces.

Figure (b) proves that if two traces satisfy the interchange property,
then they coincide.

Finally, if one of the traces is the canonical one obtained from a
dual of X, then the interchange property holds by standard
diagrammatic reasoning (see Figure (c)). In particular, if a dual
exists, then the trace on X is unique.

The proof, as shown in the attachment, is only correct in the
symmetric case. It also works in the balanced case, provided that one
inserts a twist map in the correct places.

Fred Linton has in this mail enlighten us all about the meaning in french of
the words  "aboutissement" and "aboutement". Quite different meanings.

(*) It seems that "aboutir" means more or less "to arrive" or "to finish"
"come to the end"  etc,

while "abuter" means 'to join end to end',

thus ""abuter" a path" would mean "to make it into a loop" while ""aboutir" a
path" would mean "to arrive to the end point"

if "abutment" translates "aboutement",
                           it certaily does not translate "aboutissement"

Having in mind (*) above, somebody knowledgeable in both mathematics (in
particular spectral sequences) and english should be able to come up with a
correct english version of what Grothendieck meant by "aboutissement", which
was certainly not  "abutment".

As Phil Scott immediately pointed out to me, the proof of this
folklore result appears in a 2000 slide by Masahito Hasegawa entitled
"A short proof of the uniqueness of trace on tortile categories", see

 http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~hassei/papers/canonicaltrace.gif

and also on p.23 in a paper by the same author that is to appear in
MSCS, entitled "On traced monoidal closed categories":

I am going to risk putting my two cents here and perhaps being
rejected by the moderator.

One of the reasons why a word may need to be changed even if it has
existed for 50 years is to avoid confusion. For example in the
book "Categories for Software Engineering" the author talks about
the "social life" of a set being the other sets it talks to. For a
long while this puzzled me, until it dawned on me that the idea
that the author was using was that the origins of modern
Object-Orientated Programming (ie C++, Java) started with
SmallTalk. In SmallTalk, objects communicated with one another by
sending messages; and so making an analogy with familiar concepts
that programmers use "sets have a social life" because SW
objects "talk" to each other by sending messages.

Stated another way it is difficult to see how a (Mathematical)
object is the same as a (Software) object. The latter gets created
and destroyed as the object comes in and out of scope. Hence what
does one do? When stated generically, does the word object mean a
mathematical one (around 60 years old) or a software one (more
widely used)?

Nim.

Meanwhile I count eight occurrences of "abut" and "abutment" in the (36
kilobyte!) main Wikipedia article on spectral sequences (there are a
dozen separate much shorter articles on particular spectral sequences,
along with a 15 kB article on derived categories).

On the other hand the algebra and geometry articles of the 1987
Britannica Macropaedia both prefer the term "limit" for what a spectral
sequence converges to, in respectively Peter Hilton's contribution
"Other aspects of homological algebra" to the algebra article, and the
geometry article's section on algebraic topology.

Since Wikipedia seems to be trumping Britannica these days, and no one

To add to the chatter on this topic I'll point to the bilingual
Grothendieck-Serre Correspondence (Pierre Colmez, Jean-Pierre Serre, eds.,
Catriona Maclean, tranlater.  AMS/SMF, 2004).  The first appearance of
"abutment" of a spectral sequence appears on p. 21 as the translation of
Serre's "au bout" (quotation marks in the text.)  On p. 26 Grothendieck uses
"l'aboutissement" (in quotation marks) which is also translated as
"abutment".  Aboutissement and the translation abutment, without quotation
marks, then appear on occasion throughout the remainder of the text.

A few gentle corrections, if I may, and a comment. =


First, a recurrent typo:

*never* "abuter" -- only "abouter".

Next, when I wrote

> French "abouter" is a verb, derived from "bout", whose meaning is
> 'to join (or to place) end to end'

I omitted what I (evidently incorrectly) thought went without saying;
better would have been to include it, so:

> 'to join (or to place) [two things] end to end'

(thus "abouter" can be used for the placement of two successive =

spans of a bridge, as in Vaughan's illustration, with the
special dedicated support where the two spans 'abut' being,
obviously, an 'abutment'; but one would not ["abouter" a path]).

And then, I omitted to mention that the verb "aboutir" is
*intransitive* -- it does *not* accept any direct object.
Thus it is linguistically impossible to ["aboutir" a path]: but
one *may* say of a path that it "aboutit" *at* a certain point,
or *in* a certain set, or ... .

[There is a reflexive cognate of "aboutir" -- "s'aboutir" -- used in
gardening terminology to mean 'to bud' or 'to be covered with buds',
but this usage surerely serves only as a red herring if one wants =

to understand "aboutir" proper.]

Finally, to make peace with Jim S and Mike B: I in no way intend
what I've written (initially just privately, first to Mike, and =

then to Eduardo) to dictate new terminology in place of established =

spectral sequence usage. And I very much appreciate Jim's having shared =

his mental 'abutting' vision for that usage. And yet, remembering the
triples/monads transition, I wonder whether a similar transition
may not yet take place as regards "aboutissement", etc.

Cheers, -- Fred

[PS: As not all mail-readers render what are known as HTML named entities=
 =

correctly, let me just add that, where a reader may see an 'agrave' betwe=
en
an ampersand and a semicolon, I had intended an "a" with 'accent grave';
my similarly placed 'eacute' was meant to show as "e" with 'acute accent'=

Apologies to all those whose mail-readers garble these. -- Fred]

There are common  words, rarely used in a technical sense,
that however may be useful as explanatory marginal
alternatives of foreign words. The "ab...ment d.. " being
discussed seems to be explained by  "goal", as in
       f is the goal of F
where F is the Fourer series of a function f (which leaves to
particular investigation the question of actual convergence).

In turn "goal" can be helpfully explained as=20
             purpose
a concept that academic discussions should not forget.

Thaks, Vaughan

That reraises a question I implied earlier
limit for the E_\infty term is appropriate
but that is the graded of what I dimly recall the SS
abuts to - the ungraded, e.g. H^(E) in the Serre-Leray SS

anyone confirm that?

"aboutissement" existed for over 50 years of course, but the translation
"abutment" is, (at least in the references given in these postings, including
the translation of the grothendieck-serre correspondence) much more recent, it
seem that all of its occurrences are from the second millennium, or very close.

On the other hand, we have learned in these postings that in the 1980's and
before, the word "limit" (and not "abutment') was used for what a spectral
sequence converges to. An authority as Peter Hilton used "limit".

There are a lot of well established words in mathematics which are not
particularly meaningful, but the difference with  "abutment" is precisely that
they are well established.

Karl Hofmann assures me that the domain of \beta^{p,q} is indeed
E^{p,q}_\infty, which is the important point.  As for the word used, it is
unimportant since that approach to spectral sequences seems to have gone
by the boards.

Thanks to Mike Mislove for posing this question to Karl.

And now maybe the moderator can shut down this thread.

=2E.. Henri Cartan (1904-2008)

The world has lost one of the greatest scientists of the twentieth
century. Henri Cartan, a legendary figure in mathematics, died in
Paris on 13 August, at the age of 104 years.

The son of the great mathematician Elie Cartan, his contributions to
mathematics were fundamental, from several complex variables to
algebraic topology and homological algebra. A member of the Bourbaki
group, his participation in the rejuvenation of the French
mathematical school was essential, in particular through his seminar
held at the =C9cole Normale Sup=E9rieure. His roles as teacher and mentor=

were also exceptional, and were felt well beyond national boundaries.

G is now talking about locally compact spaces and there are two phrases I
have not seen.  One is "relatively compact".  I assume this is the same as
what I call "conditionally compact", i.e. having compact closure.  The
other is "denombrable".  The context is "Suppose that the locally compact
space $X$ is denombrable a l'infini".  Does it mean first countable?

I don't want to start a discussion what bad terms these are, I just want
to know what they mean.

These are Bourbaki terms.

Denombrable: countable

denombrable a l'infini: countable at infinity
(the point at infinity of the Alexandroff compactification
of a locally compact space has a countable neighborhood base)

relativement compact: relatively compact (having compact closure)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We invite you to join us in Montreal next October for a weekend meeting
  in Category Theory, the "not-quite-annual" OctoberFest. As has been the
  tradition with these meetings, we invite talks from all participants. If
  you wish to give a talk, send your request along with a short abstract
  (well before the end of September please) to Robert Seely at the address
  below. The final schedule of talks will be handed out at the meeting,
  but a provisional schedule should be available on the webpage, if
  possible, before the meeting.

  We will meet in Concordia's Faubourg building ("FG" on the Concordia
  map) on Saturday morning, October 4th. The FG building is located at
  1616 St. Catherine W., corner of St Mathieu (see the Campus map).

  Lectures will be in room FGB040 in the basement of the FG building. To
  access this, the easiest way is via the St Mathieu entrance, then go two
  floors down. We'll provide more explicit instructions on the website
  soon, and we'll post signs to help on the day.

  Coffee will be available from 8:30 am. The first talk will be at 9:00.

  Information re parking: Concordia has an indoor parking garage in the LB
  (Library) building, 1436 Mackay, near the site of the talks - the daily
  rate on weekends is only $6.

  There will be a very modest registration fee to cover refreshments and
  sundries (details to be specified later). Registration will take place
  during the morning, before the first talk and during the first coffee
  break.

  We plan to arrange a buffet lunch on Saturday at a local Indian
  restaurant (participants responsable for their own costs). Some
  recommendations for dinner will be available, but participants are
  officially on their own(!) in the evening.

  Please let us know if you intend to join us by sending a short email
  (before the end of September if possible) to Robert Seely.

  Below you will find a list of hotels and tourist rooms close to
  Concordia. We've provided links (on the webpage) to those that ought to
  be the most suitable. Please note that October is a popular month for
  visiting Montreal, and early booking is recommended.

  If you have any further questions, please contact one of us.

Depending on the author, "relatively compact" can mean either
having compact closure, or having *any* compact superset.
In a Hausdorff space, these are equivalent.

Thanks to Jonathan Chiche and Johannes Huebschman for the answer to my
question.  First off, according to the online Encyclopedia of Mathematics,
relatively compact means having compact closure (I had called that
conditionally compact; neither term is very evocative).

Now to denombrable a l'infini, first Johannes wrote that it meant that the
one point compactification had a countable basis at the point at infinity.
Then Jonathan pointed to a '57 paper of M. Zisman that actually defined it
to mean \sigma-compact.  In the context of locally compact spaces, the two
definitions are easily seen to be equivalent!  Since \sigma-compact seems
to be widely used, I will go with that.

And now let us break off this thread.

Dear Jim and colleagues,

By urging the study of the good geometrical ideas and constructions of
Chen and Froelicher, as well as of Bott, Brown, Hurewicz, Mostow, Spanier,
Steenrod, I am of course not advocating the preferential resurrection of
the particular categories they tentatively devised to contain the
constructions.

Rather, recall as an analogy the proliferation of homology theories 60
years ago; it called for the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms to unite them.
Similarly, the proliferation of such smooth categories 45 years ago would
have needed a unification. Programs like SDG and Axiomatic Cohesion have
been aiming toward such a unification.

The Eilenberg-Steenrod program required, above all, the functorality with
respect to general maps;  in that way it provided tools to construct even
those cohomologies  (such as compact support and L2 theories) that are
less functorial.

The pioneers like Chen recognized that the constructions of interest (such
as a smooth space of piecewise smooth paths or a smooth classifying space
for a Lie group) should take place in a category with reasonable function
spaces. They also realized, like Hurewicz in his 1949 Princeton lectures,
that the primary geometric structure of the spaces in such categories must
be given by figures and incidence relations (with the algebra of functions
being determined by naturality from that, rather than conversely as had
been the 'default' paradigm in 'general' topology, where the algebra of
Sierpinski-valued functions had misleadingly seemed more basic than
Frechet-shaped figures.) I have discussed this aspect in my Palermo paper
on Volterra (2000).

The second aspect of the default paradigm, which those same pioneers
seemingly failed to take fully into account, is repudiated in the first
lines of Eilenberg & Zilber's 1950 paper that introduced the key category
of Simplicial Sets. Some important simplicial sets having only one point
are needed (for example, to construct the classifying space of a group).
Therefore. the concreteness idea (in the sense of Kurosh) is misguided
here, at least if taken to mean that the very special figure shape 1 is
faithful on its own. That idea came of course from the need to establish
the appropriate relation to a base category U such as Cantorian abstract
sets, but that is achieved by enriching E in U via E(X,Y) = p(Y^X),
without the need for faithfulness of
p:E->U;  this continues to make sense if E consists not of mere cohesive
spaces but of spaces with dynamical actions or Dubuc germs, etcetera, even
though then p itself extracts only equilibrium points. The case of
simplicial sets illustrates that whether 1 is faithful just among given
figure shapes alone has little bearing on whether that is true for a
category of spaces that consist of figures of those shapes.

Naturally with special sites and special spaces one can get special
results: for example, the purpose of map spaces is to permit representing
a functional as a map, and in some cases the structure of such a map
reduces to a mere property of the underlying point map. Such a result, in
my Diagonal Arguments paper (TAC Reprints) was exemplified by both smooth
and recursive contexts; in the latter context Phil Mulry (in his 1980
Buffalo thesis) developed the Banach-Mazur-Ersov conception of recursive
functionals in a way that permits shaded degrees of nonrecursivity in
domains of partial maps, yet as well permits collapse to a 'concrete'
quasitopos for comparison with classical constructions.

Grothendieck did fully assimilate the need to repudiate the second aspect
(as indeed already Galois had done implicitly; note that in the category
of schemes over a field the terminal object does not represent a faithful
functor to the abstract U). Therefore Grothendieck advocated that to any
geometric situations there are, above all, toposes associated, so that in
particular the meaningful comparisons between geometric situations start
with comparing their toposes.

A Grothendieck topos is a quasitopos that satisfies the additional
simplifying axiom:
        All monomorphisms are equalizers.
A host of useful exactness properties follows, such as:
         (*)All epimonos are invertible.
The categories relevant to analysis and geometry can be nicely and fully
embedded in categories satisfying the property (*). That claim arouses
instant suspicion among those who are still in the spell of the default
paradigm; for that reason it may take a while for the above-mentioned
45-year-old proliferation of geometrical category-ideas to become
recognized as fragments of one single theory.

There is still a great deal to be done in continuing
  K.T. Chen's application of such mathematical categories to the calculus
of variations and in developing applications to  other aspects of
engineering physics. These achievements will require that students persist
in the scientific method of alert participation, like guerilla fighters
pursuing the laborious and cunning traversal of a treacherous jungle
swamp. For in the maze of informative 21st century conferences and
internet sites there lurk fickle pedias and beckening bistros which, like
the mythical black holes, often regurgitate information as buzzwords and
disinformation.

Greetings

Let's just hope none of this creates another situation
like the one Sammy reported facing in a North African
fish restaurant, where his menu offered, among other
local delicacies, "Fried Pimp", the author evidently =

having rendered the Arabic word for the fish in question, =

actually a mackerel, first into French as "maquereau", =

and thence into English as "pimp". =


Rhymes with "shrimp" -- easier to type than "mackerel" --
so why not?

Cheers, -- Fred

Dear Bill and Colleagues,=20

I would like to explain my own interest in function spaces and function =
objects since it has a different origin to what Bill explains and a =
different direction which could be of interest for comment and =
investigation.=20

Michael Barratt suggested to me in 1960 the problem of calculating the =
homotopy type of the space X^Y by induction on the Postnikov system of =
X, in contrast to Michael's own work on Track Groups, where he used a =
homology decomposition of Y, and using Whitney's tube systems gave =
explicit description of some group extensions in examples of the =
Barratt(-Puppe) exact sequence. (amazing!!?)=20

Now the first Postnikov invariant in its simplest form is a Sq^2 but the =
extension is described by a Sq^1. How did the one transform into the =
other? Clue: the Cartan formula for Sq^2 on a product. How did a product =
get into the act? Answer: the evaluation map!=20

Trying to write all this down led to using a number of `exponential =
laws' in spaces, spaces with base point, simplicial sets, pointed =
simplicial sets, chain complexes, simplicial abelian groups, etc. So it =
was dinned into me that an exponential law depended on the product as =
well as the function object. So why not try the known weak product for =
topological spaces? Surprise, surprise, it all worked, and was part 1 of =
my thesis, submitted 1961, with a sketchy account of what we now call =
monoidal closed categories, exemplified,  but not developed in general =
terms.=20

Subsequent work with Philip Higgins has continued to use monoidal closed =
categories in algebraic topology. Indeed the category of crossed =
complexes is cartesian closed, but the homotopy theory one wants is =
given by the (different) monoidal closed structure. So the category of =
filtered spaces is usefully enriched  over this monoidal closed =
category.=20

My question is then: what is the potential influence of this need for =
monoidal closed? It clearly does not lead to topos theory as such. It =
does lead to the possibility of some not previously available =
calculations, even of nonabelian homotopical invariants, and is relevant =
to the study of local-to-global problems. (I first heard these words =
from Dick Swan in connection with sheaf theory.)  But in this work =
cubical sets became essential, for ease of discussing subdivision, =
multiple compositions,  and homotopies, and here the monoidal closed =
structure is crucial. Kan's initial cubical work was neglected in favour =
of the (convenient in many ways) cartesian closed category of simplicial =
sets.=20

One specific problem for me was a general notion of symmetry (naively, =
and using buzz words (!), higher order groupoids should yield higher =
order notions of symmetry!). In a cartesian closed category C we have =
for a specific object x not only Aut(x), the isomorphisms of x, but also =
AUT(x), the internal group object of automorphisms of x. This has been =
developed for the topos of directed graphs, in John Shrimpton's thesis, =
but actually the unaccomplished aim was to understand Grothendieck's =
Teichmuller Groupoid, and his envisaged computations of this by gluing =
or clutching procedures, but which needed topos theory, he claimed! When =
I asked for any notes on this he just said nothing was written down, it =
was all in his mind. Baffling! =20

In the monoidal case we can get only that END(x) is an internal monoid =
wrt tensor. But in some cases  we have a candidate for AUT(x), even if =
`internal group' wrt tensor makes no sense.  One example was worked out =
with Nick Gilbert (published 1989). In this case there is a forgetful =
functor U to a cartesian closed category, in this case Set, and you can =
make up the rest. It worked in this dimension, relevant to homotopy =
3-types, but still did not lead by induction to even higher order =
notions of symmetry. Pity!=20

My question is now: given this background, how should  we  match the =
beautiful ideas and insights of Bill with what seem to be some monoidal =
closed realities? Could this be important for geometry, and, better =
still, even for analysis, and dynamics?=20

Dear Ronnie and Colleagues,

Your comments are extremely interesting.  Thank you very much for raising
in so striking a manner the question of the relation between general
monoidal structures and cartesian closed structures.
Below are some observations which show, I think,
that everybody should be interested in this relation because it is
manyfold and fruitful.

(1)	While cartesian closed structures have the virtue of being unique,
general monoidal closed structures have the virtue of not being unique.
Thus, for example, the cartesian closed presheaf toposes (with their
exactness properties and combinatorial truth object) often have a further
monoidal closed structure given by Brian Day's convolution with respect to
a pro-co-monoidal structure on the site. Cubical as well as simplicial
sets have both cartesian and non-cartesian closed structures, and that is
'true', not merely 'convenient'.

(2)	Another category having both cartesian and non-cartesian monoidal
structures is the real interval from zero to infinity with 'x dominates y'
as the morphism from x to y. (Actually, this category is derived by
collapsing a natural topos of dynamical systems in 'Taking categories
seriously' TAC Reprints.) Categories enriched with respect to the
non-cartesian structure here (see 'Metric Spaces' TAC reprints) arise
every day in analysis and the rich insights of enrichment theory (Functor
categories, bi-module composition, free categories, etcetera) should be
systematically applied to the advance of analysis and geometry, while on
the other hand metric examples inspire further developments of enrichment
theory. Cauchy (who never worked on idempotent splitting in ordinary
categories and additive categories in the way that Freyd and Karoubi did)
does not deserve to have his name brandished as a joke to scare one's
uncomprehending colleagues in analysis. The kind of completeness that is
inspired by two-sided intervals (unlike the one-sided intervals
inaccurately alluded to in common discussions of 'density') indeed reduces
to the one attributed to Cauchy in the particular example of Metric
Spaces. The author hoped that observation would contribute to the advance
of analysis and the development of enrichment theory, not to the supply of
buzzwords.

     In fact, there is an insufficiently known branch of analysis called
'Idempotent Analysis', which deals largely with composition of bi-modules,
or more precisely, with the relation between the two closed structures on
the infinite interval. Of course, that monoidal category is isomorphic to
the unit interval under multiplication (still cartesian closed too) which
induces many of the relations between probablility and entropy.

(3)	Perhaps the most common relation between non-cartesian monoidal
categories and cartesian categories arises when a structure such as vector
space is interpreted in a cohesive background. I am sticking to my story
that cohesive backgrounds are basically cartesian closed, due to the
ubiquitous role of diagonal maps and also due to the fact that, for
example, bornological vector spaces have an obvious monoidal closed
structure, whereas topological vector spaces have none. The rumor that
topological vector spaces might have a tensor with an adjoint hom is part
of the disinformation that makes functional analysis look more difficult
than it is. A more accurate account of the relation between non-Mackey
convergence and closed structure can be found in C. Houzel's paper on
Grauert finiteness, Mathematische Annalen, vol. 205, 1973, 13-54:
essentially, the topological categories are merely enriched in the
genuinely monoidal closed bornological ones. Similarly, the idea that not
all dual spaces are complete seems to be based on a misguided generality
in the notion of Cauchy nets (they should be bounded).

(4)	Although pointed spaces are somewhat entrenched in algebraic
topology, there is an improvement suggested by your own work, Ronnie.
Consider the category whose objects are arrows S ---> E where E is a space
(object of a cartesian closed cohesive background category) and S is a
discrete space. This category is even a topos if the category of E's was,
as is the larger category of arrows between general pairs of spaces. The
first category is actually an adjoint retract of the second, correcting
the discontinuity that arises from the traditional limitation S = 1.
Intuitively, in the case where the pair of spaces is a subspace inclusion,
the adjoint collapses the subspace to a point if the subspace is
connected, but if it is not connected, does not artificially merge its
components. There are many applications of this corrected construction of
the space which results from 'neglecting' a subspace, both in algebraic
topology and in functional analysis, too numerous to discuss here.

Dear Bill and Colleagues,=20

In reply here only to Bill (4), but great interest in the other =
comments, I entirely agree with the many pointed approach, which was =
published in my 1967 Proc LMS article. This is  relevant also to higher =
homotopy theory. If you define \pi_n(X,P) where P is now a *set* of base =
points, then you see this has to have the structure of module over =
\pi_1(X,P). As an example of its use, consider the map=20

                  S^n \vee [0,1] \to S^n \vee S^1

which identifies 0 and 1, where the S^n is stuck to [0,1] at 0.  Clearly =
\pi_n of the first space on the set of base points P consisting of 0 and =
1 is the free module on one generator over the indiscrete groupoid =
\I=3D\pi_1([0,1],P). The main theorem of Higgins and RB implies that =
\pi_n of the second space at 0 is the free module on one generator over =
the infinite cyclic group, which itself is obtained from \I by =
identifying 0 and 1 in the category of groupoids.=20

I know this result can also be obtained using covering space arguments =
and homology, but I got into groupoids by trying to avoid this detour to =
covering spaces  to describe the fundamental group of S^1. It is a =
question of finding algebra which  models geometry.=20

One of my joint papers, which calculated (using vKT for crossed modules) =
some  \pi_2(X,x)  as a module,  was rejected by one journal on the =
grounds that the calculations were too elaborate when `the interest is =
in the group and not the module'. So much for homological algebra!=20
There is a culture in algebraic topology which neglects the operations =
of \pi_1;  perhaps it seems an encumbrance when there is only one base =
point, but Henry Whitehead commented in 1957 that the operations =
fascinated the early workers in homotopy theory.=20

It is amusing to speculate what might be infinite loop space theory, or =
little cube operads, if you allow many base points! Could it clear up =
the subjects??!! Answers on a postcard please (joke).=20

A standard lesson in mathematics is that you should forget structure at =
the latest possible moment. In homotopy theory low dimensional =
identifications can and usually do affect higher dimensional homotopy =
invariants. To try and cope with this, we need homotopical functors =
which carry algebraic information in a range of dimensions, to model how =
spaces are glued together. This has been the aim of the various Higher =
Homotopy van Kampen theorems. To handle these algebraic structures one =
needs category theory ; as one example,  I am currently working on a =
joint paper using fibred and cofibred categories to relate high and low =
dimensional information on colimits and induced structures. =20

The hope also is that because of the wide interest in deformation, i.e. =
homotopy,  as a means of classification, these tools and methods will =
have wider implications.=20

Disinformation is *deliberate* false information, false information
*intended* to mislead.  As I understand it, Bill's statement says,
among other things, that disinformation often appears on the
n-Category Cafe.

I don't know whether Bill really meant to say this.  I very much hope
not.  I can't think of a single instance where someone at the
n-Category Cafe has intended to mislead.

Best wishes,
Tom

hi,
        this is related to theory of formal languages.

         i would like to know if anyone has some references for ,
         categories of formal languages, in particular "regular languages".
         how do we capture the notion of 'regularity' in categories?

Dear All

This "situation" reminds me of the following:

In 1976 Alexandrov was 80 years old.
A. Dold was invited to contribute to the Festschrift,
and so he did. Dold wrote his contribution
in English and it got translated thereafter into Russian.

A little while after the Festschrift had appeared Dold
received a letter from a professional translator who had translated
his paper from Russian into English.
