People have been asking me for several years to write "introductions"
to ASD, or to "write down all the axioms together".  This was not
possible while the core theory for locally compact spaces was still
being investigated,  but that process has essentially come to an end.

There are now FOUR introduction/survey papers, aimed at different
audiences, and all available from   www.PaulTaylor.EU/ASD

(lamcra)   "A Lambda Calculus for Real Analysis"
     suitable for a general mathematical audience

(intawi)   "Interval Analysis Without Intervals"
     aimed at programmers of "exact real arithmetic" but not finished

(dedras)   "The Dedekind Reals in Abstract Stone Duality"
     (with Andrej Bauer) suitable for theoretical computer scientists

(foufct)   "Foundations for Computable Topology"

I was invited to write this last paper for a volume on Foundations
of Mathematics that is more inclined towards philosophy than
technicalities and has contributions from categorists, set theorists
and philosophers.

My paper therefore begins with a discussion of the methodology behind
ASD, and in particular the thesis that foundations can be devised
FOR mathematics (rather than vice versa)  by encapsulating headline
theorems as universal properties and translating these into systems
of introduction/elimination/beta/eta rules for new logical connectives.

ASD abstracts Stone duality between algebra and topology by saying
that the carriers of the algebras belong to the dual category of
spaces, and formalises this as a monad.   The topological meaning
of Beck's characterisation of monadic adjunctions is that (certain)
equalisers exist and carry the subspace topology in a canonical way.
Several examples of this are given, in particular related to compactness
of the real closed interval.   Then the lambda calculus associated
with the monad is described.

The key object is the Sierpinski space Sigma.  The Euclidean and
Phoa principles are deduced from the property of classifying all,
open or closed subsets.  (A proof is included that Sierpinski
classifies closed sublocales.)   Conversely, the monadic and
Euclidean principles make Sigma a dominance.   Discrete, Hausdorff,
compact and overt spaces are discussed.

Set theory (ie the theory of discrete spaces) is used as a comparative
case.  Although most of the details of other arguments are only
sketched,  this paper includes the whole of the proof of the
characterisation of elementary toposes using the ideas of ASD,
without any mention of subobjects.

Sketches of other parts of the theory are also given.  The paper
tries to tell the whole story of the development of ASD, from a
foundational and empirical point of view,   It is therefore of
necessity a "broad brush" approach, as the material would easily
fill a book.   This paper is also meant to be complementary to
the others listed above,  so it says very little about the
applications to elementary real analysis.

It also says very little about the computational interpretation
of ASD, but, at least as far as the real numbers are concerned,
you can expect to hear more from Andrej and me on this subject
in the future.

If you would like to comment on "Foundations for Computable Topology",
please do so before the end of July.

Dear all,

Here is a new preprint. Sincerely yours, pg.

Title: Combinatorics of labelling in higher dimensional automata

Abstract: The main idea for interpreting concurrent processes as labelled
precubical sets is that a given set of n actions running concurrently must be
assembled to a labelled n-cube, in exactly one way.  The main ingredient is
the non-functorial construction called labelled directed coskeleton. It is
defined as a subobject of the labelled coskeleton, the latter coinciding in
the unlabelled case with the right adjoint to the truncation functor. This
non-functorial construction is necessary since the labelled coskeleton
functor of the category of labelled precubical sets does not fulfil the above
requirement.  We prove in this paper that it is possible to force the
labelled coskeleton functor to be well-behaved by working with labelled
transverse symmetric precubical sets. Moreover, we prove that this solution
is the only one. A transverse symmetric precubical set is a precubical set
equipped with symmetry maps and with a new kind of degeneracy map called
transverse degeneracy. Finally, we also prove that the two settings are
equivalent from a directed algebraic topological viewpoint. To illustrate, a
new semantics of CCS, equivalent to the old one, is given.

A new University of New Mexico technical report is available on DSpace,
ECE-TR-08-0010.  It  describes an experiment in cognitive psychology that
tests a (mathematical) category-theoretic model of categorization by
humans.  The model is part of a comprehensive theoretical model of the
declarative semantics of neural networks.   The report can be obtained by
going to DSpaceUNM, or directly to  http://hdl.handle.net/1928/6724  .

Questions and comments are welcome.

Abstract

Categorization and the judgement of similarity are fundamental in
cognition. We propose that these and other activities are based upon an
underlying structure of knowledge, or concept representation, in the
brain. Further, we propose that this structure can be represented
mathematically in a declarative form via category theory, the mathematica=
l
theory of structure. We test the resulting mathematical model in an
experiment in which human subjects provide judgements of similarity for
pairs of line drawings using a numerical scale to represent degrees of
similarity. The resulting numerical similarities are compared with those
derived from the category-theoretic model by comparing diagrams. The
diagrams represent distributed concept structures underlying the line
drawings. To compare with a more conventional analysis technique, we also
compare the human judgements with those provided by a two-dimensional
feature space model equipped with a distance metric for the line drawings=
.
 The results are equally favorable for both models. Because of this and
the putative explanatory power of the category-theoretic model, we propos=
e
that this model is worthy of further exploration as a mathematical model
for cognitive science.

Dear All, this is to announce the three papers below available from the top
of <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/latest.html>.  Best regards, Marcelo.


1. M. Fiore and C.-K.Hur.  On the construction of free algebras for
    equational systems.  Submitted, 2008.

    Abstract.  The purpose of this paper is threefold: to present a general
    abstract, yet practical, notion of equational system; to investigate and
    develop the finitary and transfinite construction of free algebras for
    equational systems; and to illustrate the use of equational systems as
    needed in modern applications.


2. M. Fiore and C.-K. Hur.  Term Equational Systems and Logics.  To appear
    in 24th Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics Conf.
    (MFPS XXIV), 2008.

    Abstract.  We introduce an abstract general notion of system of equations
    between terms, called Term Equational System, and develop a sound logical
    deduction system, called Term Equational Logic, for equational reasoning.
    Further, we give an analysis of algebraic free constructions that together
    with an internal completeness result may be used to synthesise complete
    equational logics.  Indeed, as an application, we synthesise a sound and
    complete nominal equational logic, called Synthetic Nominal Equational
    Logic, based on the category of Nominal Sets.

    Keywords.  Equational systems, algebraic theories, free algebras,
    equational logic, soundness, completeness, Nominal Sets, Schanuel topos.


3. M. Fiore.  Second-order and dependently-sorted abstract syntax.  In
    Logic in Computer Science Conf. (LICS'08), pages 57-68.  IEEE, Computer
    Society Press, 2008.

    Abstract.  The paper develops a mathematical theory in the spirit of
    categorical algebra that provides a model theory for second-order and
    dependently-sorted syntax.  The theory embodies notions such as
    alpha-equivalence, variable binding, capture-avoiding simultaneous
    substitution, term metavariable, meta-substitution, mono and multi
    sorting, and sort dependency.  As a matter of illustration, a model is
    used to extract a second-order syntactic theory, which is thus guaranteed
    to be correct by construction.

All,

i recently ran across a use of fold (in the functional programming sense)
where i wanted to solve for the accumulator type. i realized that something
in the neighborhood of a combinatory logic would be a minimal solution. This
got me thinking... there are various versions of combinators for the
\lambda-calculus and there's Haghverdi's combinators for linear lambda and
there are Yoshida's combinators for Milner's \pi-calculus. The first two
will work in the setting i encountered, the latter will not because -- in
addition to (parallel) composition -- Yoshida's combinators require a new
and replication operator. So, i'm wondering if anyone has given an abstract
characterization of a combinatory logic/algebra? If so, does anyone have a
reference?

Best wishes,

--greg

[Longish note from moderator:

The gracious words below are much appreciated, sincere thanks to Walter.
I'm reluctantly following the injunction at the bottom of his message.
It gives me the chance to write that the "categories" and TAC jobs are
done gladly, and indeed without altruism - any service to the category
theory community is absolutely its own reward. It's always a privilege,
and the very best of intellectual fun and challenge, to be associated with
category theorists and category theory. As to TAC especially, this is also
a chance for my thanks, on behalf of our community, to the hard-working
TAC Editors (none more so than Walter) and their referees. Special thanks
also go to Michael Barr for keeping TAC looking good.

Please don't reply to the list on this off-topic item. Walter has written
very kindly for everyone who might do so.
]


Hi Bob:

Bill Lawvere already mentioned your big birthday in Calais, but not
everybody on the "categories" list may be aware that today (July 9, if I
remember correctly) is the actual day when you get elevated into some
already heavily populated grey zone: congratulations!

Somewhat more importantly, I would like to take the occasion to thank you
for the immense service to our community that you have been providing for
so many years now, by initiating and running "categories" and "TAC". In
fact, I believe that both ventures have been critical in building a sense
of community that becomes most apparent at the CT meetings. Your cool and
consistently measured style in running the two enterprises has won you
everybody's respect and gratitude, I think.

Last, but not least, let me take this occasion to thank you, Maria Manuel
Clementino, George Janelidze and Jiri Rosicky for editing a special volume
in TAC marking my own entry into that grey zone that you are reaching
today. As mentioned to you earlier, it's obviously an undeserved honour
which I nevertheless enjoy tremendously. Of course, I am especially
indebted to the authors who have contributed to the volume.

Thanks again, and best wishes,

Walter.

Hello list,

I am looking for references on the following facts about interpreting
some sentences involving infinitesimals in filter-powers instead of in
ultrapowers...

Notation:
    \I is an index set;
    \F is a filter on \I;
    \U is an ultrafilter on \I, possibly extending \F;
    if X is a topological space and x is a point of X, then
    \V_x is the filter of neighborhoods of x in X;
    Set^\F is a shorthand for the filter-power (Set^\I)/\F;
    Set^\U is a shorthand for the ultrapower (Set^\I)/\U;

Terminology:
    Set is the "standard universe";
    Set^\U is the "non-standard universe";
    Set^\F is the "semi-standard universe";
    points of Set^\I are called "sequences", or "pre-hyperpoints";
    points of Set^\F or Set^\U are called "hyperpoints".

Well, the facts. Here they are:

(1) For any (standard) function f:X->Y from a topological space to
    another, and for any standard point x in X, the following three
    statements are equivalent:

    (a) f is continuous at x;
    (b) for all choices of a triple (\I, \F, x_1), where \I is an
        index set, \F is a filter on \I, and x_1 is a hyperpoint
        infinitely close to x, then f(x_1) is infinitely close to f(x);
    (c) for the "natural infinitesimal" (\I, \F, x_1) := (X, \V_x, id),
        the hyperpoint f(x_1) is infinitely close to f(x).

(2) Any filter-infinitesimal (\I, \F, x_1) infinitely close to x
    factors through the natural infinitesimal (X, \V_x, id) in a unique
    way.

(3) We can use these ideas to lift proofs done in a certain "strictly
    calculational fragment" of the language of non-standard analysis to
    constructions done in a filter-power; and then, if we replace the
    free variables that stand for infinitesimals in our formulas by
    natural infinitesimals, we get (by (c)<=>(a) in (1)) a translation
    of our proof with infinitesimals to a standard proof, in terms of
    limits and continuity.

On the one hand, I have never seen anything published about
filter-infinitesimals, and it took me a long time to find the right
formulations for this... on the other hand, ideas similar to these
seem to be implicit in many places (see the last sections of the PDF).
However, my guess is that at least parts of (3) are new.

There are more details at:
  http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/2008filterp.pdf

Thanks in advance for any pointers, comments, etc...
Questions welcome, of course. Cheers,

Dear All

Given a Lie group G and a G-representation V, according
to Hochschild-Mostow, the
ordinary Eilenberg-Mac Lane construction, suitably interpreted
in terms of smooth functions, yields a differentiably injective
resolution of V over G. More precisely, the Eilenberg-Mac Lane
construction (dual bar construction) arises here as the differentiable
cosimplicial G-module having, in degree p,
the space of smooth V-valued maps on a product of p+1 copies
of G, with the ordinary coface and codegeneracy operators.

Suppose now that G is connected and finite-dimensional and let
K be a maximal compact subgroup. Hochschild-Mostow have also shown that the
V-valued differential forms on G/K then yield an injective
resolution of V over G as well. This kind of construction actually
goes back to van Est.

The standard procedure yields comparison maps between the two resolutions.
In degree zero the comparison is, of course, achieved by the obvious map
from C^{\infty}(G/K,V) to C^{\infty}(G,V) induced by the projection
from G to G/K and by the obvious map
from C^{\infty}(G,V) to C^{\infty}(G/K,V) induced by integration over K.

Does anybody know whether, in the literature, the constituents of
a comparison map in higher degrees have been spelled out explicitly
somewhere?

Many thanks in advance

Best regards

Johannes

   The workshop will take place at the University of Sussex. It will
   commence at 9:30am on Monday morning and close around 4pm on
   Wednesday afternoon.


ACCOMMODATION

   Bed & breakfast on campus in single rooms with en suite bathroom
   (standard) is available at 45 pounds per night in our brand new
   halls of residence or at a more economical 30.50 pound with shared
   facilities (budget).
   Lunch is included in the registration fee. There will be no organized
   evening meals except the Workshop dinner.


REGISTRATION

   Registration is now open. Please download the registration form
   from the workshop web pages at:

The following book appeared in April this year:

Jaap van Oosten - Realizability: an Introduction to its Categorical Side
Studies in Logic 152, Elsevier

This book is a monograph about the effective topos and related toposes.
The book is intended to provide advanced undergraduate students and
Ph.D. students with a concise introduction to the effective topos.
Contains introductions to partial combinatory algebras, tripos theory,
construction of the effective topos. Synthesizes the existing
literature, making a lot of material accessible to all readers. Many
applications to recursive analysis, intuitionistic set theory, synthetic
domain theory. Reviews abstract aspects of the effective topos
construction. Variations are also developed, such as Lifschitz
realizability, Modified realizability, Kleene-Vesley realizability.

  Dear Colleagues:

we are happy to announce the 2008 edition of

"Computability: Computable Functions, Logic, and the Foundations of=20
Mathematics"

Authors: Richard L. Epstein and Walter Carnielli
Publisher: Advanced Reasoning Forum, 2008

*3rd. Edition*

" Now in a new edition --the classic presentation of the theory of
computable functions in the context of the foundations of mathematics.
Part I motivates the study of computability with discussions and
readings about the crisis in the foundations of mathematics in the
early 20th century while presenting the basic ideas of whole number,
function, proof, and real number. Part II starts with readings from
Turing and Post leading to the formal theory of recursive functions.
Part III presents sufficient formal logic to give a full development
of G=F6del's incompleteness theorems. Part IV considers the significance
of the technical work with a discussion of Church's Thesis and
readings on the foundations of mathematics. This new edition contains
the timeline 'Computability and Undecidability' as well as the essay
'On Mathematics'. "

Where can I find a published proof that
     if    X --->> Y   is a (not necessarily regular)  epi  of locales
     then so is   X x Z --->> Y x Z   for any locale Z?

NB  (I know that) this is not true for general pullbacks of locales!

Ideally,  I'd like to cite a textbook-style account that begins by
characterising epis and regular monos as idempotent adjunctions,
saying that they form a factorisation system, and describes the
product of locales fairly explicitly.

Paul

Abstract. Symmetric weak cubical categories were introduced in
previous papers, as a basis for the study of cubical cospans in
Algebraic Topology and higher cobordism. Such cubical structures are
equipped with an action of the n-dimensional symmetric group on the n-
dimensional component, which has been used to simplify the coherence
conditions of the weak case.

	We give now a deeper study of the role of symmetries. The category
of ordinary cubical sets has a Kan tensor product, which is non
symmetric and biclosed, with left and right internal homs based on
the right and left path functors. On the other hand, symmetric
cubical sets have one path functor leading to one internal hom and a
symmetric monoidal closed structure. Similar facts hold for cubical
and symmetric cubical categories, and should play a relevant role in
the sequel, the study of limits and adjunctions in these higher
dimensional categories. Weak double categories, studied in four
papers with R. Pare, are a cubical truncation of the present structures.

	While constructing examples of cubical categories, we also
investigate a 'rewriting' procedure of reduction to canonical forms,
which allows one to quotient a weak symmetric cubical category of
cubical spans (resp. cospans), and obtain a strict symmetric cubical
category of 'cubical relations' (resp. 'cubical profunctors').

Folk,

Subsequent to my first attempt at
illustrating the Two Category, Fred
Linton added,
  "Is it worth noting, in this jpeg, that the
  arithmetical max(1-A, B) for B^A coincides
  here with the Boolean {not}A or B for the
  classical B => A?"

Another insight for me.  Thanks.

I've made a fresh sketch including a table
of notations.

Apologies for the very poor graphical
quality.  I am working on an SVG version.

Further criticisms and suggestions are
welcome of course.

Thanks,         ... Peter E.

I would like to call the attention of the categorical community to the
very interesting post
http://www.fermentmagazine.org/Quest88.html
It reports the successful quest in 1988 of Roy Lisker to meet
Grothendieck.

I first met Roy nearly 55 years ago when we were in a HS math club.  I
lost track of him for several decades and then met him again in Peter
Freyd's office at Penn, probably in 1990.  Since then I have had desultory
e-contact with him (plus running into him once in person).  I read
this then, but he has now posted it online.  Eventually, I will put a copy
on my own ftp site.

I was sorry not to be at the Calais meeting the other week and had hoped
to have the paper=20

=20

Aspects of slice stability in Locale Theory

=20

http://www.christophertownsend.org/Documents/SliceStability_v30.pdf

=20

ready for it.=20

=20

This paper proves that a particular axiomatic approach to locale theory
is slice stable and then uses this slice stability to prove some known
locale theory/topos theory results.

All the results are known (aside from a conjecture on localic
subgroupoids) so it is really an investigation into this particular
axiomatisation rather than a presentation of new results.=20

It gives what I think is a novel proof of the well known slice stability
result: Loc/Y =3D Loc_Sh(Y).=20

=20

Feedback is welcome. For example, I have always attributed the result
Loc/Y =3D Loc_Sh(Y) to Joyal and Tierney. Am I right?=20
