Considering that Google returned 'Your search - "Melzak Bypass
Principle" - did not match any documents,' the acronym might be a tad
premature.  But in the spirit of the question the connection I'd be
tempted to make (predictably given my biases) would be with duality
rather than adjunction.  Thus floor: R --> Z as right adjoint to the
inclusion of Z into R is a (posetal) example of adjunction (with the
numerical inequalities x <= y as the morphisms) that in this case
forgets the continuum structure of R, whereas duality being an
involution (at least up to equivalence) necessarily retains all the
categorical structure in mirror image.

For example to understand finite distributive lattices, transform them
to finite posets, work on them in that guise, and transform back at the
end.  Being a categorical duality, the resulting understanding of
distributive lattices includes their homomorphisms, which under this
duality become monotone functions.  Complete atomic Boolean algebras are
even simpler: viewed in the duality mirror they are just ordinary sets
transforming by functions.  Hence the homset CABA(2^X,2^Y) of complete
Boolean homomorphisms from 2^X to 2^Y as complete atomic Boolean
algebras is (representable as) the set X^Y of functions f:X --> Y  (so
for example there are 5^3 = 125 Boolean homomorphisms from 2^5 to 2^3).
  Likewise one can understand Boolean algebras and their homomorphisms
in terms of their dual Stone spaces and continuous functions, while the
self-duality of any category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a
given field is a linchpin of matrix algebra and essential to the linear
algebra examples you cited for "MBP."

There is such a diversity of fruitful dualities, of widely varying
characters, that one despairs of finding any uniformity to them.  For me
this is where Chu spaces enter.  What I find so appealing about Chu
spaces is that they tap into a vein of uniformity running through these
disparate examples whose global structure is that of *-autonomous
categories, or linear logic when seen "in the light of logic."  (One can
view *-autonomous categories as being to *-autonomous categories of Chu
spaces roughly as Boolean algebras are to fields of sets and toposes to
toposes of presheaves.)  All of the dualities listed above and many more
can be exhibited as (usually not *-autonomous) subcategories of
Chu(Set,K) for a suitable set K, with each such category and its dual
connected by the self-duality of the *-autonomous category Chu(Set,K)
itself.

http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/index.html#vol17 , the special issue of TAC on
Chu spaces that Valeria de Paiva and I edited, conveys some of the
flavor of this.  Mike Barr gives a history of Chu spaces at
http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/17/1/17-01.pdf, while the preface at
http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/17/pref/17-pref.pdf supplements Mike's
history and gives an overview of the papers in the volume.  My 1997
Coimbra notes http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/coimbra.pdf on Chu spaces
play a more introductory role (the first half anyway, the second half
emphasized linear logic more than I would have if I were writing it today).

The Chu space scene has been a bit quiet lately.  I'm hopeful it will
see a revival at some point as it's a great framework for viewing many
specific dualities, as well as being a fruitful alternative to the more
traditional tools of algebra and coalgebra for representational
applications, see e.g. http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/seqconc.pdf .

Sorry to be misleading with MBP; perhaps I should have said Melzak's
"Bypass Principle", or Melzak's "Bypass" principle, rather than using the
MBP abbreviation for typing convenience, because both Google and Google
Scholar provide lots of relevant hits to searches without the quotes.
Anyway, the basic reference I have in mind is: Z. A. Melzak, "Bypasses, A
simple approach to complexity" John Wiley & Sons (1983) ISBN 0-471-86854-=
X

The connection with duality is very appealing, thank you, because
dualities certainly offer some very profound insights. However, I have no
intuition as to why an adjunction suggested by a (Melzak's) Bypass should
have unit and counit as isomorphisms? Should there be a "dualizing object=
"
lurking about? Are there any known dualities for presheaf categories=20
Set^(C^op) where C is something simple like (1 --> 1) or (2 <-- 1 --> 2)
or (1 --> 2 --> 3 <-- 1) etc. (identities omitted). What I'm looking for
is a bypass for gluing presheaves.

Thank you for your kind comments. ...... Al

LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (LICS) 2008
  Call for Short Talks
  Submission Deadline: April 21, 2008
* Following a now established tradition, there will be two short talk
  sessions during LICS 2008. You may submit a 1-2 page abstract to
  give a 5-10 minute talk during one of two sessions described
  below. You must clearly indicate which session you would like to
  speak at. Short talks may be trailers for longer presentations at
  one of the affiliated workshops, or stand entirely on their
  own. Abstracts are made available on the LICS website but are not
  published in the conference proceedings. Provocative and
  programmatic presentations are welcome! Note that speakers in either
  session must be registered for LICS or CSF.
* Session 1 (Tue Jun 24): Logic and Security (joint session with CSF)
  Talks should be of interest to the security and logic communities,
  ideally building bridges or proposing new points of intersection or
  applications of one area in the other.
* Session 2 (Thu Jun 26): Logic in Computer Science (LICS-only session)
  Talks can be of any topic related to logic in computer science as
  summarized in the LICS call for papers.
* Abstracts can be submitted at
  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlicscsfshorts2008
  Please check the appropriate box, if you would like your talk to be
  considered for the joint CSF/LICS session.

  The URL for submitting papers is
  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlicscsfshorts2008.
  This link will bring you to a page labelled Submission Page for
  LICS/CSF Shorts 2008.
* There are two zones: (1) Registered User and (2) New User. The first
  time you use the system you will have to use the New User
  fields. Shortly after that a password will be emailed to you. You can
  use this password to access the system thereafter as a registered
  user.
* On this page you can enter the title, authors, contact author
  information and plain text abstract. The plain text abstract has to be
  under 300 words. It can be typed in directly or pasted in with a
  browser. You can upload your talk abstract using the web page. Using
  this submission system you can manage your short talk abstract
  submitted to LICS 2008. You can submit new papers, resubmit previously
  submitted papers, or change information about authors.
* Abstracts for proposed short talks must be in pdf format and should be
  1-2 pages long.

E. W. BETH DISSERTATION PRIZE: 2008 CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS
* Since 2002, FoLLI (the European Association for Logic,
  Language, and Information, www.folli.org) awards the
  E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize to outstanding
  dissertations in the fields of Logic, Language, and
  Information. We invite submissions for the best
  dissertation which resulted in a Ph.D. degree in the
  year 2007. The dissertations will be judged on technical
  depth and strength, originality, and impact made in at
  least two of the three fields of Logic, Language, and
  Computation. Inter-disciplinarity is an important
  feature of the theses competing for the E. W. Beth
  Dissertation Prize.
* Who qualifies
  Nominations of candidates are admitted who were awarded
  a Ph.D. degree in the areas of Logic, Language, or
  Information between January 1st, 2007 and December
  31st, 2007. There is no restriction on the nationality
  of the candidate or the university where the Ph.D.
  was granted. After a careful consideration, FoLLI has
  decided to accept only dissertations written in
  English. Dissertations produced in 2007 but not written
  in English or not translated will be allowed for
  submission, after translation, also with the call
  next year (for 2008). Respectively, nominations of
  full English translations of theses originally
  written in other language than English and defended
  in 2006 and 2007 will be accepted for consideration
  this year, too.
* Prize
  The prize consists of:
  - a certificate
  - a donation of 2500 euros provided by the E. W. Beth
    Foundation.
  - an invitation to submit the thesis (or a revised
    version of it) to the new series of books in Logic,
    Language and Information to be published by
    Springer-Verlag as part of LNCS or LNCS/LNAI. (Further
    information on this series is available on the FoLLI site)
* How to submit
  Only electronic submissions are accepted. The following
  documents are required:
  1. the thesis in pdf or ps format (doc/rtf not accepted);
  2. a ten page abstract of the dissertation in ascii or pdf format;
  3. a letter of nomination from the thesis supervisor.
     Self-nominations are not admitted: each nomination must
     be sponsored by the thesis supervisor. The letter of
     nomination should concisely describe the scope and
     significance of the dissertation and state when the
     degree was officially awarded;
  4. two additional letters of support, including at least one
     letter from a referee not affiliated with the academic
     institution that awarded the Ph.D. degree.
* All documents must be submitted electronically to
  bethaward2008@gmail.com. Hard copy submissions are not
  admitted.
  In case of any problems with the email submission or a lack
  of notification within three working days after submission,
  nominators should write to goranko@maths.wits.ac.za or
  policriti@dimi.uniud.it.

  Computer security is an established field of computer science of both
  theoretical and practical significance. In recent years, there has
  been increasing interest in logic-based foundations for various
  methods in computer security, including the formal specification,
  analysis and design of security protocols and their applications, the
  formal definition of various aspects of security such as access
  control mechanisms, mobile code security and denial-of-service
  attacks, and the modeling of information flow and its application to
  confidentiality policies, system composition, and covert channel
  analysis.
* WITS is the official annual workshop organised by the IFIP WG 1.7 on
  "Theoretical Foundations of Security Analysis and Design", established
  to promote the investigation on the theoretical foundations of
  security, discovering and promoting new areas of application of
  theoretical techniques in computer security and supporting the
  systematic use of formal techniques in the development of security
  related applications. This is the eighth meeting in the series.
* The workshop FCS continues a tradition, initiated with the Workshops
  on Formal Methods and Security Protocols (FMSP) in 1998 and 1999, then
  with the Workshop on Formal Methods and Computer Security (FMCS) in
  2000, and finally with the LICS satellite Workshop on Foundations of
  Computer Security (FCS) in 2002 through 2005, of bringing together
  formal methods and the security community.
* ARSPA is a series of workshops on Automated Reasoning for Security
  Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers and practitioners
  from both the security and the formal methods communities, from
  academia and industry, who are working on developing and applying
  automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal specification
  and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA workshops were
  held as satellite events of the 2nd International Joint Conference on
  Automated Reasoning (IJCAR'04) and of the 32nd International
  Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP'05),
  respectively.
* FCS and ARSPA have been joining forces since 2006: FCS-ARSPA'06 was
  affiliated with LICS'06, in the context of FLoC'06, and FCS-ARSPA'07
  was affiliated with LICS'07 and ICALP'07.
* The aim of the joint workshop FCS-ARSPA-WITS'08 is to provide a forum
  for continued activity in different areas of computer security,
  bringing computer security researchers in closer contact with the LICS
  community and giving LICS attendees an opportunity to talk to experts
  in computer security, on the one hand, and contribute to bridging the
  gap between logical methods and computer security foundations, on the
  other.

  Automated reasoning techniques
  Composition issues
  Formal specification
  Foundations of verification
  Information flow analysis
  Language-based security
  Logic-based design

SECOND INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON PROOF-CARRYING CODE (PCC 2008)
  Call for Papers
  22 June 2008
  Carnegie Mellon University
  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA
  http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/pcc08/
* PCC 2008 is a joint LICS and CSF affiliated workshop on Proof-Carrying
  Code.
* Proof-carrying code is an important and distinctive approach to
  enhancing trust in programs. It provides a practical framework for
  independent assurance of program behaviour; especially where source
  code is not available, or the code author and user are unknown to
  each other.
* The workshop will address theoretical foundations of proof-carrying
  code as well as practical examples and work on alternative application
  domains. Here "proof" is construed broadly, to include not just
  mathematical derivations but any formal evidence that supports the
  static analysis of programs. That is, evidence about an intrinsic
  property of code and its behaviour that can be independently checked
  by any user, intermediary, or third party. These manifest guarantees
  mean that PCC raises trust in the code itself, distinct from and
  complementary to any existing trust in the creator of the code, the
  process used to produce it, or its distributor.
* Topics include:
  - PCC addressing properties of safety, security, and correctness
    such as:
          Memory safety, information flow, declassification, resource
          management, access control, protocol enforcement, functional
          correctness.
  - Examples of PCC in application domains, including but not
    limited to:
          Mobile code, mobile devices, operating systems, grid
          computing, peer-to-peer computing, active networks, embedded
          systems, cloud computing, databases, e-Science.
  - Probabilistically-checkable proofs, zero-knowledge proofs,
    proof-on-demand.
  - Trust and policy frameworks; supporting modular and extensible
    systems; compositionality in code and proofs.
  - Certifying compilation, proof-transforming compilation,
    certified verifiers.
  - Logics and notions of certificate specific to proof-carrying
    frameworks.

6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FORMAL MODELLING AND  ANALYSIS OF
  TIMED SYSTEMS (FORMATS'08)
  Saint-Malo, France, September 15--17, 2008
  (Co-Located with QEST'08 : www.qest.org)
  http://formats08.inria.fr
* Submission Deadline : **May 12th**, 2008
  Submission is now open
  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dformats08
* Objectives and Scope of the Conference
  Timing aspects of  systems from a variety of  computer science domains
  have been treated independently by different communities.  Researchers
  interested in  semantics, verification and  performance analysis study
  models  such as  timed automata  and  timed Petri  nets.  The  digital
  design  community focuses  on propagation  and switching  delays while
  designers of  embedded controllers  have to take  account of  the time
  taken  by controllers to  compute their  responses after  sampling the
  environment.
  Timing related  questions in these separate disciplines  do have their
  particularities. However, there is  a growing awareness that there are
  basic  problems that are  common to  all of  them. In  particular, all
  these  sub-disciplines  treat  systems  whose behaviour  depends  upon
  combinations of logical  and temporal constraints; namely, constraints
  on the temporal distances between occurrences of events.
  The  aim  of  FORMATS is  to  promote  the  study of  fundamental  and
  practical aspects of timed  systems, and to bring together researchers
  from  different  disciplines that  share  interests  in modelling  and
  analysis of timed systems. Typical topics include (but are not limited
  to):
  - Foundations  and  Semantics:  Theoretical foundations  of  timed
   systems and languages; comparison between different models (timed
   automata,  timed  Petri  nets,  hybrid  automata,  timed  process
   algebra, max-plus algebra,  probabilistic models).
  - Methods and Tools:  techniques, algorithms, data structures, and
   software tools for analyzing timed systems and resolving temporal
   constraints  (scheduling,  worst-case  execution  time  analysis,
   optimisation, model-checking, testing, constraint solving, etc).
   - Applications:   adaptation   and   specialization   of   timing
   technology  in  application  domains  in which  timing  plays  an
   important  role  (real-time   software,  hardware  circuits,  and
   problems of scheduling in manufacturing and telecommunication).
* Submission and Publication:
  The proceedings  of FORMATS'08  will be published  by Springer  in the
  Lecture Notes in Computer  Scienceseries. Papers must contain original
  contributions, be clearly  written, and include appropriate references
  to and comparison with  related work. Simultaneous submission to other
  conferences  with published  proceedings is  not  allowed. Submissions
  should  not exceed  15 pages,  and  should be  formatted according  to
  Springer  LNCS  guidelines.  If   necessary,  the  submission  may  be
  supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be reviewed at
  the discretion of the program committee.

* SCOPE OF CONFERENCE
  FMCAD 2008 is the eighth in a series of conferences on the theory and
  application of formal methods in hardware and system design and
  verification. In 2005, the bi-annual FMCAD and sister conference
  CHARME decided to merge to form an annual conference with a unified
  community. The resulting unified FMCAD provides a leading
  international forum to researchers and practitioners in academia and
  industry for presenting and discussing groundbreaking methods,
  technologies, theoretical results, and tools for formally reasoning
  about computing systems, as well as open challenges therein.  Topics
  of interest for the technical program include, but are not limited to:
  - Foundations: advancing industrial-strength technologies in model
    checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and
    refinement techniques, property-preserving reduction techniques,
    compositional methods, decision procedures, SAT- and BDD-based
    methods, combining deductive methods with decision procedures, and
    probabilistic methods.
  - Verification applications: tools, industrial experience reports,
    and case studies.  We encourage the submission of materials
    relating to novel and challenging industrial-scale applications of
    formal methods, including problem domains where formal methods
    worked well or even fell short. We also encourage submissions
    relating to the development and execution of methodologies for
    formal and informal verification strategies.
  - Applications of formal methods in design: topics relating to the
    application and applicability of assertion-based verification,
    equivalence checking, transaction-level verification, semi-formal
    verification, runtime verification, simulation and testcase
    generation, coverage analysis, microcode verification, embedded
    systems, software verification, concurrent systems, timing
    verification, and formal approaches to performance and power.
  - Model-based approaches: modeling and specification languages,
    system-level design and verification, design derivation and
    transformation, and correct-by-construction methods.
  - Formal methods for the design and verification of emerging and
    novel technologies: nano, quantum, biological, video, gaming, and
    multimedia applications.
* Paper Submission
  Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format through the
  FMCAD'08 web site, http://fmcad.org/2008. The proceedings will be
  published by ACM and will be available online in the ACM Digital
  Library and the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Two categories of papers
  can be submitted: regular papers (8 pages), containing original
  research that has not been previously published, nor concurrently
  submitted for publication; and short papers (4 pages), describing
  applications, case studies, industrial experience reports, emerging
  results, or implemented tools with novel features.
  Regular and short papers must use the IEEE Transactions format on
  letter-size paper with a 10-point font size (see
  http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html).
  We recommend that self-citations be written in the third person, though
  authors will be required to identify themselves on their submissions.
  Submissions must contain original research that has not been
  previously published, nor concurrently submitted for publication. Any
  partial overlap with any published or concurrently submitted paper
  must be clearly indicated. If experimental results are reported,
  authors are strongly encouraged to provide adequate access to their
  data so that results can be independently verified.
  A small number of accepted papers will be considered for a
  distinguished paper award.

 http://www.leduotang.com/sylvain/ddbp2008/
 http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~edoc2008/
 Affiliated workshop of the 12th IEEE International EDOC Conference
* DESCRIPTION
 The capability of rapidly adapting systems and processes to an
 ever-changing environment to leverage existing resources has become a
 crucial factor of an organization's agility. The traditional approach
 to process management is only partially appropriate to this new
 context, and calls for the advent of new, dynamic business processes.
 Broad business policies or narrower constraints of technical nature
 make dynamic business process particularly suited to a declarative
 approach to their modelling and design.
* TOPICS
 Topics of the workshop include but are not limited to:
 - Dynamic business process modelling
 - Implementation issues for dynamic processes
 - Tools for dynamic processes
 - Use cases of dynamic processes
 - Business and technical requirements for dynamic processes
 - Declarative model specification
 - Mathematical and logical foundations of declarative business
   processes
 - Formal models of declarative business processes
 - Monitoring of declarative business processes
 - Validation of declarative business processes
 - Tools for declarative business processes
* PUBLICATION
 The papers accepted for the workshop will be published with their own
 ISBN by the IEEE in the IEEE Digital Library.
* IMPORTANT DATES
  - Paper submission:  June 13th, 2008
  - Paper notification:  July 18th, 2008
  - Camera ready:  July 28th, 2008

24RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LOGIC PROGRAMMING (ICLP'08)
  Call for Workshop Proposals
  December 9-13, 2008
  Udine, Italy
  http://iclp08.dimi.uniud.it/
* ICLP'08, the 24rd International Conference on Logic Programming, will
  be held in Udine (Italy), from December 9 to 13, 2008.
* Workshops co-located with international conferences are one of the
  best venue for the presentation and discussion of preliminary work or
  novel ideas, and new open problems to a wide and interested audience.
  Co-located workshops also provide an opportunity for
  presenting specialized topics and opportunities for intensive
  discussions and project collaboration. The topics of the workshops
  co-located with ICLP'08 can cover any areas related to logic
  programming,
  (e.g., theory, implementation, environments, language issues,
  alternative paradigms, applications) including cross-disciplinary
  areas.
  However, any workshop proposal will be considered.
* The format of the workshop will be decided by the workshop organizers,
  but ample time must be allowed for general discussion. Workshops can
  vary in length, but the optimal duration will be half a day or a
  full day.
* Workshop Proposal:
  Those interested in organizing a workshop at ICLP'08 are invited
  to submit a workshop proposal. Proposals should be in English and
  about two pages in length. They should contain:
  - The title of the workshop.
  - A brief technical description of the topics covered by the
    workshop.
  - A discussion of the timeliness and relevance of the workshop.
  - A list of some related workshops held in the last years
  - The (preliminary) required number of half-days allotted to the
    workshop and an estimate of the number of expected attendees.
  - The names, affiliation and contact details (email, web page, phone,
    fax) of the workshop organizer(s) together with a
    designated contact person.
  - The previous experiences of the workshop organizing committee in
    workshop/conference organization.
* Proposals are expected in ASCII or PDF format. All proposals should be
  submitted to the Workshop Chair (Tran Cao Son) by email
  (tson@cs.nmsu.edu) by June 2nd, 2008.
* Workshop Organizers' Tasks:
  - Producing a "Call for Papers" for the workshop and posting it
    on the net and/or other means. Please provide a web page URL which
    can be linked into the ICLP'08 home page by July 15th, 2008.
  - Providing a brief description of the workshop for the conference
    program.
  - Reviewing/accepting submitted papers.
  - Scheduling workshop activities in collaboration with the local
    organizers and the workshop chair.
  - Sending workshop program and workshop proceedings in  pdf
    format to the workshop chair for printing (deadline to be defined)
  - The use of the Computing Research Repository (CoRR) for the
    workshop proceedings is strongly suggested
    (see http://www.logicprogramming.org/
    [Guidelines for electronic publishing of proceedings])
* Location:
  All workshops will take place in the city of Udine at the site of the
  main conference. See the ICLP'08 web site for location details.

BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT: PRINCIPLES OF MODEL CHECKING
  by Christel Baier and Joost-Pieter Katoen
  MIT Press 2008, 993 pages
  ISBN: 978-0-262-02649-9
* Principles of Model Checking offers a comprehensive introduction to
  model checking that is not only a text suitable for classroom use but
  also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the
  field.
* The book begins with the basic principles for modeling concurrent
  and communicating systems, introduces different classes of properties
  (including safety and liveness), presents the notion of fairness, and
  provides automata-based algorithms for these properties. It introduces
  the temporal logics LTL and CTL, compares them, and covers algorithms
  for verifying these logics, discussing real-time systems as well as
  systems subject to random phenomena. Separate chapters treat such
  efficiency-improving techniques as abstraction and symbolic
  manipulation. The book includes an extensive set of examples (most of
  which run through several chapters) and a complete set of basic
  results accompanied by detailed proofs. Each chapter concludes with
  a summary, bibliographic notes, and an extensive list of exercises
  of both practical and theoretical nature.
* Complementary material such as slides and solutions to selected
  exercises will be made available to lecturers.
* Foreword by Kim G. Larsen; endorsements by Moshe Vardi and Gerard
  Holzmann
* Further information can be found at:

It's not category theory, but you might anyway be interested in...

THE RANKIN LECTURES 2008

The Rankin Lectures 2008 will be given by John Baez (University of
California, Riverside).  The series title is

"My Favorite Numbers"

and the individual lecture titles are

Mon 15 September, 4pm:  "5"
Wed 17 September, 4pm:  "8"
Fri 19 September, 4pm: "24".

They will be held at the University of Glasgow, and are supported by the
Glasgow Mathematical Journal Trust.  Information and abstracts can be
found at

http://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~tl/rankin/


If you can come, you'd be very welcome to visit for the week and chat -
there should be some like-minded people about.  As it's a lecture series
rather than a conference, there are no travel funds and we're not
organizing accommodation, but you can find practical information on
visiting at www.maths.gla.ac.uk .

Best wishes,

I'm trying to find out what the appropriate definition of a symmetric
monoidal closed bicategory is.  Day & Street define symmetric monoidal
bicategories in "Monoidal bicategories and Hopf algebroids."  Has
someone considered the closed case?  Are there different notions of
closed for a bicategory, the adjoints to tensoring with an object
versus tensoring with a 1-morphism?  I've been told that
pseudoadjunctions are the appropriate generalization of adjunctions
for the bicategory case.

Now that I actually have a copy of the paper, I find it's in

Many of the accounts of Dedekind cuts that I have seen, including the
original one, wave their hands in the most blatant way, especially
with regard to multiplication. Nevertheless, several deep and powerful
ideas have been incorporated into this theory in the course of 150
years. This posting is a summary of them, and was written in the hope
that somebody might tell me who first discovered each of
them. However, whilst I am always glad to receive mathematical,
historical and philosophical comments from my colleagues, I would
respectfully ask, on this occasion in particular, that they first
check them against the actual papers that they cite, and against the
bibliography of my paper with Andrej Bauer:

        The Dedekind Reals in Abstract Stone Duality
        www.PaulTaylor.EU/ASD/dedras

This paper originally appeared in the proceedings of Computability and
Complexity in Analysis, held in Kyoto in August 2005. It has now been
accepted for a journal, and we intend to finalise it very soon.

Abstract Stone Duality is a new axiomatisation of recursive general
topology without set theory. In it, the Dedekind reals satisfy the
Heine--Borel property ("finite open subcover" compactness of [0,1]),
whereas this fails in traditional recursive analysis based on set
theory. How ASD achieves this is, of course, explained in the paper,
but I also gave a summary in my posting to the categories mailing list
on 18 August 2007.

However, this posting is about different issues, and will be expressed
in traditional (set-theoretic) language. Where I have "d in D" here,
in ASD it is written "delta d".

Please see  www.PaulTaylor.EU/ASD/dedras/classical.html  for a version
of this posting that includes links and mathematical symbols.  It
was sent to sci.math.research several weeks ago, generating some
discussion of the definition of reciprocals of intervals, but not of
most of the main points of history about which I wanted to ask.

It did, however, lead me to the original papers about the Archimedean
principle and the classical result that this follows from Dedekind
completeness.  I can send references to anyone who is interested in
this point, or you can search for the names Stolz, Veronese, Killing,
Bettazzi, Vivanti and Holder.   The historical expert on this is
Philip Ehrlich at the University of Ohio.


DEFINITION OF A DEDEKIND CUT

Dedekind originally defined a cut (D,U) as a partition of the
rationals. This means that there are two representations of each
rational number q as a cut, namely ({d | d <= q}, {u | u > q}) and
({d | d < q}, {u | u >= q}). This is messy, even in the classical
situation, so our definition omits q in this case. Who first did this?

The letters D and U stand for "down" and "up", for which they are
conveniently positioned in the alphabet. For the moment, all lower
case variables range over the rationals.

We want to say, in a mathematically sensitive way, that D and U have
no endpoints:
        d in D   <=>   Some e. (d < e)  &  e in D
and    u in U   <=>   Some t. (t < u)  &  t in U.

This property is called roundedness, and I learned it in the context
of continuous lattices. Where did it come from originally?

D and U also need to be bounded and disjoint:
        Some d. d in D,        Some u. u in U
and    d in D  &  u in U  =>  d < u,
although there are other ways of expressing disjointness.

The final condition is the most interesting one. We want to say that D
and U account for the whole line, apart from at most one point, or
"almost touch". There is an order-theoretic way to say this,
        d < u    =>   d in D  or  u in U,
and an arithmetical one,
        eps > 0  =>   Some d u. d in D  &  u in U  &  u-d < eps.
These properties are called locatedness. Who formulated them,
particularly the first one? Was is Brouwer, perhaps?

I shall return to the difference between these two notions of
locatedness, but first examine some useful subsystems.




ONE-SIDED REALS

Although Andrej and I only set out to construct the real line itself,
we found that both the construction and the applications forced us to
consider other structures first.

Consider D on its own, satisfying just the roundedness condition.
Classically, D = {d | d < a} where a = sup D  in  R + {-oo, +oo}.
he collection of all such D or a forms a continuous lattice,
which naturally carries the Scott topology.

As the set D grows, so does the extended real number a. Customarily,
we use a temporal metaphor for the reals, and a vertical one for
lattices, so I call D an ascending real, although it is called
(I think) lower elsewhere. Similarly, U is a descending or upper real.

There is a bijection between rounded lower subsets D of the rationals
and of the reals, and this respects the other properties, so I shall
switch between the two without comment. This bijection is essentially
the idempotence of the cut construction in Dedekind's paper.

An (extended) real-valued function f is called lower semicontinuous if
f^-1 (a,+oo] is open for all a. I have checked the handedness of this
definition with two textbooks and two websites, but who first used it?

A function is lower semicontinuous iff it is continuous in the generic
sense as a function to the ascending reals with the Scott topology.



CONSTRUCTIVE LEAST UPPER BOUND

Constructively and computationally, it is not always possible to form
sup D.

The supremum, if it is a real number a, is represented by a Dedekind
cut ({d | d < a}, {u | u > a}). But the lower half of this must be the
original D.   So, I'm saying that an ascending real D need not have a
descending partner U for which (D,U) is a cut.

If, as is essentially the case in ASD, D and U are recursively
enumerable
sets of rationals, an RE set D need not have an RE complement U.

Let S be any set of real numbers, and suppose that a = sup S exists as
a real number. Then, as R is totally ordered, for any x < y, either x<a
or a<y, and in the latter case, s<y for all s in S.

So, if sup S exists then, for any x<y, either x<s for some s in S
or s<y for all s in S.  This is known as the constructive least upper
bound principle.

Douglas Bridges told me that Errett Bishop knew it, and Bas Spitters
says that similar ideas occur in Brouwer's work, but cannot pinpoint
the statement. Did Brouwer formulate it? If not, who did?

A subset S of a metric space X is called located if the distance
d(x,S) = inf {d(x,y) | y in S} exists, for all points x in X. Who
formulated this idea? Classically, using infima of distances like this
goes back to Hausdorff.

Is ASD, using the same logical principle, we find that the supremum of
any compact subspace of ? exists, but it is a descending real
number. Similarly, the supremum of an overt subspace is an ascending
real number. If the subspace is compact, overt and nonempty, it has a
maximum.



INTERVALS

If D and U are rounded and disjoint, R\D\U is classically a closed
interval, [d,u], where d = supD and u = infU; these are +/- oo
unless D and U are bounded. The systematic study of intervals and
their arithmetic was begun by Ramon Moore.

I claim that intervals should be represented by the sets D and U, and
not by the numbers d and u or the closed subset [d,u].

At any stage in the computation of a real number, we have so far
demonstrated that some numbers are lower bounds, and some are upper
ones. These (and their lower and upper closures) form sets D and U.

For example, Archimedes measured the area of a circle by inscribing
and circumscribing polygons, and Riemann integration is defined in the
same way for general continuous functions.

When dealing with sets of lower and upper bounds like this, it is
usually automatic that D and U be rounded and disjoint. Sometimes
boundedness may be in doubt, but usually the most difficult part is to
demonstrate locatedness. Intervals (possibly infinite ones) separate
the easy parts of a proof or computation from the difficult ones.

In the case of Riemann integration of a continuous function on a
closed interval, locatedness follows from uniform continuity. It is
then much easier to demostrate the linearity properties of the
integral using Dedekind cuts that with limits of Cauchy sequences.

Similarly, it is possible to define the derivative of any continuous
function, as an interval. This is bounded iff the function is
Lipschitz and located iff it is differentiable in the standard sense.




INTERVAL ARITHMETIC

Ramon Moore defined the arithmetic operations on intervals as follows:

         [d,u] + [e,t]  =  [d+e, u+t]
               - [d,u]  =  [-u,   -d]
         [d,u] x [e,t]  =  [min (d e,d t,u e,u t), max (d e,d t,u e,u t)]
              [d,u]^-1  =  [u^-1, d^-1]   if 0 notin [d,u]
                                            ie  0 in D  or  0 in U
                        =  [-oo, +oo]     if 0 in [d,u]

The formula for multiplication is complicated by the need to consider
all possible combinations of signs.

However, we have just said that supD and infU need not exist as real
numbers, so we have more work to do to define the arithmetic
operations for them.

This extension can be defined, using methods from continuous lattices,
so long as each operation * is rounded in the sense that

         [d,u] * [e,t] << [a,z]   =>   Some d' u' e' t'.
         [d,u]<<[d',u'] & [e,t]<<[e',t'] & [d',u']*[e',t']<<[a',z']

where [d,u] << [d',u'] means d'<d & u<u'. This is easy to prove for
addition, but rather messy for multiplication. It's neither difficult
nor deep, but the property is important, so is it stated anywhere?



COMPLETENESS OF INTERVAL COMPUTATION

Standard interval analysis evaluates a function with an interval as
its argument by replacing the usual arithmetic operations with Moore's
generalisation to intervals. This overestimates the range of a
function, often by a long way.

However, we may compute the set-theoretic image of an interval [d,u]
to within any  eps>0  by sub-dividing [d,u] into sufficiently but
finitely many parts, applying the function Moore-wise to each part,
and forming the union. Where is this theorem (first) proved in the
interval literature? This result is the basis of the construction of R
and the proof that [d,u] is compact in ASD.



BACK-TO-FRONT INTERVALS

Bizarrely, it is also possible to UNDERestimate the image by considering
back-to-front intervals. This was first done by E.W. Kaucher, but can
anyone give me his paper or tell me his first name? It is also used to
construct the existential quantifier in our paper.

It does not make sense to represent Kaucher intervals as closed
subspaces: we should use D and U instead, although they now overlap.



DEDEKIND COMPLETENESS AND THE ARCHIMEDEAN AXIOM

A total order X is Dedekind complete if every pair of subsets D, U of X
that satisfies the axioms for a cut is of the form
         D = {d | d < a}     and     U = {u | u > a}
for some unique a in X.

Dedekind cuts of the rationals form a Dedekind complete field, ie a
cut composed of real numbers defines another real number. In other
words, Dedekind's construction is idempotent.

Q and R are Archimedean:
         eps>0   =>   Some n:N.  (n-1) eps < x < (n+1) eps.

Classically, R is the only Dedekind complete ordered field, because
Dedekind completeness implies the Archimedean principle.

Proof: the sets
         D = {d | Some n:N. d < n}     and     U = {u | All n:N. u > n}
are rounded, disjoint and order-located. They are bounded (and so form
a cut) iff U is nonempty. By Dedekind completeness, the cut (D,U)
corresponds to an element  omega  of the field. This should be the only
element that lies between D and U, but  omega-1 does so too.
Hence U must be empty.

Assuming the Archimedean principle, the two definitions of locatedness
are equivalent. Who first proved these results?

John Conway's system of surreal numbers tries to extend the idea of
Dedekind completeness to infinities and infinitessimals. The whole
system is a proper class, as is U in this proof, and so (D,U) is not a
legitimate cut: Conway calls it a gap.

I conjecture (and John Conway considered this plausible when I put it
to him) that there is a version of his number system in which sets are
replaced by RE sets, and every RE Dedekind cut represents a number,
but there are also infinities and infinitessimals.

Andrej and I certainly don't construct such a thing in our
paper. However, we have isolated the use of the Archimedean principle,
in the hope that someone in future might eliminate it.



LOCATEDNESS OF THE ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS

The most difficult thing to prove is always locatedness.

In computational terms, when we are asked to compute the result of an
operation to a certain precision, we have to ask for its arguments to
the appropriate precision. For example, if we need x+y within eps,
it is enough to know x and y within eps/2.

However, for multiplication things are more complicated: we need to
know x to within  eps/|y|. This is also formulated and proved
constructively in our paper.

Finally, we also have a way of defining inverse functions
(reciprocals, roots, powers and logarithms) that the referee
considered "rather elegant".

interested in the foundations and applications of graph transformation
to a variety of areas. A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest can
be found on the conference web pages:

 	 <http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/icgt2008/Scope.html>

Within  ICGT  2008,  the  Doctoral  Symposium will  provide  a  unique
opportunity  for  doctoral  students  and  young  researchers  (having
defended their thesis  at most two years previously)  to interact with
established researchers of the graph transformation community and with
other students.

The Doctoral Symposium will be held on a date to be determined, during
the regular activities of the ICGT 2008 conference.

Presentations  for   the  Doctoral  Symposium  will   be  selected  by
designated   members  of   the  ICGT   2008  Program   Committee  (see
<http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/icgt2008/Scope.html>    according    to
originality,  significance,  and general  interest,  on  the basis  of
submitted three-pages abstracts. Accepted abstracts, revised according
to  the  comments by  the  reviewers, will  be  included  in the  LNCS
proceedings of the Conference.

After  the  conference,  selected  authors of  presentations  will  be
invited to  submit a full paper of  at most 15 pages  for the refereed
post-proceedings of  the Doctoral Symposium,  which is expected  to be
published as  a volume of  the Electronic Communications of  the EASST
(European Association of Software Science and Technology).

The notion of *equational correspondence* was defined by Sabry and
Felleisen in their paper:

    Amr Sabry and Matthias Felleisen
    Reasoning about programs in continuation-passing style
    LISP and Symbolic Computation, 6(3--4):289--360, November 1993.

We lay out below the definition, along with a related notion of
*equational embedding*.  We've seen relatively little about equational
correspondence in the literature, and nothing about equational
embedding.  Given that these seem to be fundamental concepts, we
suspect we've been looking in the wrong places.  Any pointers to
relevant literature would be greatly apprectiated.

An *equational theory* T is a set of terms t of T, and a set of equations
t =_T t' (where t, t' are terms of T).

Let S, T be equational theories.  We say that f : S -> T and g : T -> S
constitute an *equational correspondence* between S and T if

   1.  g(f(s)) =_S s,  for all terms s in S
   2.  f(g(t)) =_T t,  for all terms t in T
   3.  s =_S s'  implies  f(s) =_T f(s'),  for all terms s, s' in S
   4.  t =_T t'  implies  g(t) =_S g(t'),  for all terms t, t' in T

Let S, T be equational theories.  We say that f : S -> T and
g : f(S) -> S (where f(S) is the image of S under f, a subset of T)
constitute an *equational embedding* between S and T if

   1.  g(f(s)) =_S s,  for all s in S
   2.  s =_S s'  implies  f(s) =_T f(s'),  for all s, s' in S

It is easy to see that there is an equational embedding of S into T if
and only if there is a function from S to T that preserves and
reflects equations.

Clearly, f and g constitute an equational correspondence between S and
T if f and g constitute an equational embedding of S into T and g and
f constitute an equational embedding of T into S.

We conjecture that whenever there is an equational embedding of S into
T and of T into S that there is an equational correspondence between S
and T.  This is not immediate, because one equational embedding might
be given by f and g and the other by h and k, with no obvious relation
between the two.

As I said, any pointers to relevant literature would be greatly
appreciated!

Dear Prof. Waddler,

   I don't know if the following proof is correct, please, let me know
if I made any mistake:

   By hypothesis there exists k:S->T and h:k(S)->S such that h(k(S))
=3D_S s for all s in S and s =3D_S s' implies k(s) =3D_T k(s') for all s, s=
'
in S
   On the other hand, there exists f:T->S and g:f(T)->S such that
g(f(t)) =3D_T t for all t in T and t=3D_T t' implies f(t) =3D_S f(t') for
all t, t' in T

   Assume that there exists t in T\k(S) =3D> |T| > |S| because k is
injective and S =3D dom(k). Hence, there exists t' not equal to t such
that f(t) =3D_S f(t') which is absurdum.

   So, there not exists t in T\k(S), then T =3D k(S). So, k and k^-1
constitutes an equational correspondence.

   Yours,
     Alejandro

To my category-infected mind, it seems that what you really need
is a little category theory. :-)

I take it that your equations should define an equivalence relation?
(It seems strange to call them 'equations' if not.) If that's right,
then an "equational theory" is the same thing as an essentially-discrete
category, i.e. a category that is equivalent to a discrete one, and
an "equational correspondence" is an equivalence of categories.

With the definition of "equational embedding" you give, your
conjecture is false. For example, let the equational theories
S and T each have two terms x and y, with equations

 x =3D_S x     y =3D_S y    x =3D_S y
 x =3D_T x     y =3D_T y

We can define an equational embedding S -> T by mapping both
terms to x, and we can define an equational embedding T -> S
by mapping x to x and y to y, but there can be no equational
correspondence between S and T (since 1 !=3D 2).

It would seem more natural, at least from a categorical point
of view, to define an equational embedding to be a full functor,
i.e. a function f: S -> T such that

   s =3D_S s'  iff  f(s) =3D_T f(s').

With that definition, your conjecture is true by the
Schr=C3=B6der-Bernstein theorem.

Robin

Phil, Amr responded with the bare facts. Here is my path of
discovery, with two additional lit ptrs:

John Gately was an MS student at IU working in Indiana. I suggested
to him that he work out a cbv theory of combinators in the spirit of
Gordon Plotkin's CBN/CBV paper in TCS(1974). I also suggested that he
read Barendregt (chapter 7, with an overview in chapter 2) because it
summarizes the equational correspondence I was after. John dropped
out from IU but rejoined me at Rice and published a paper on his CBV
CL ~ lambda_v correspondence paper at some workshop (mathematical
foundations of programming languages?).

Around the same time, I started Eric Crank on a correspondence
between cps(\lambda_v) and lambda with the hope that a reduction rule
Bruce Duba and I had played with since 1985: (\x.E[x]) M  = E[M] for
x not in fv(E) [beta_Omega]. While Eric preferred to switch to
equational characterizations of imperative parameter passing, Amr
came along and solved this puzzle.

As Amr said, we tried to stay as close as possible to the source
(Curry) with our write-up for LFP 1992.

field of Concurrency. More specifically, they focus on the comparison
between programming concepts (such as concurrent, functional,
imperative, logic and object-oriented programming) and between
mathematical models of computation (such as process algebras, Petri
nets, event structures, modal logics, rewrite systems etc.) on the
basis of their relative expressive power.


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

Short papers (up to 5 pages, not included in the final proceedings)
and Full papers (up to 15 pages) are accepted only in ENTCS-style.
Paper submission is performed through the EXPRESS'08 EASYCHAIR server
(to be opened on May, 15th).

The very best papers will be invited in a special issue of the journal
of Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.


INVITED SPEAKERs:

Michele Bugliesi, Venezia (I), joint with SecCo'08;
Gianluigi Zavattaro, Bologna (I).


IMPORTANT DATES:

Abstract submission: June 1st, 2008
Paper submission: June 8th, 2008.

Important Dates (revised)
---------------

Full Paper Submission   8th May, 6am BST
Author Notification     23rd June
Final Paper             21st July
Symposium              8th-10th September


Following on the success of the first International Symposium on
Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) held at Walworth Castle in 2006,
we are pleased to announce the second, to be held in Dublin in
September 2008. Based on the pioneering work on unifying theories of
programming of Tony Hoare, He Jifeng, and others, the aims of this
Symposium series are to continue to reaffirm the significance of the
ongoing UTP project, to encourage efforts to advance it by providing a
focus for the sharing of results by those already actively
contributing, and to raise awareness of the benefits of such unifying
theoretical frameworks among the wider computer science and software
engineering communities.

Of particular interest is how unification may be used to meet the goals
and difficulties to be encountered in the Grand Challenges of
Computing, with particular reference to the UK's "GC6: Dependable
Systems Evolution", its international cousin the "Verified Software
Initiative", and their plan to develop a Verified Software Repository.

To this end the Symposium welcomes contributions on the above themes as
well as others which can be related to them. Such additional themes
include, but are not limited to, relational semantics, relational
algebra, healthiness conditions, normal forms, linkage of theories,
algebraic descriptions, incorporation of probabilistic programming,
timed calculi and object-based descriptions, as well as alternative
programming paradigms such as functional, logical, data-flow, and
beyond. In all cases, the UTP approach should be compared and
advantages/disadvantages discussed.

The proceedings  will be published in Springer LNCS.

Papers may be up to 20 pages (single-column) in length and should
ideally be prepared using LaTeX in LNCS format and submitted as
pdf files no later than 6am British Summer Time on May 8th, 2008.
Paper submission and reviewing will be handled by Easychair
    ( http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=UTP-08 )
This site is now open for submissions.

After the symposium, it is anticipated that selected papers will
invited for submission to a journal special issue.

better) diagrams.

-- Idempotents split in C.


This doesn't seem to be in Makkai-Par=E9 or Adamek-Rosicky, but surely =20=

somebody must have observed this. Actually the result is a bit more =20
general since idempotents split in *any* category that has filtered =20
colimits.


Thanks in advance,

Fran=E7ois Lamarche

Dear Francois,

I don't know how relevant this is to your thinking, but I thought I'd =20=

mention the result is constructively false.

For an example, let C be the poset with two elements b <=3D t. The only =20=

idempotents are the identities on b and t, so of course they split.

Let p be a truth value, and let I =3D {b} u {t | p}, an ideal (hence =20
directed) in C. If this has a colimit, then it must be either b or t. =20=

The colimit is b iff not p (so I =3D {b}), and it follows that if the =20=

colimit is t we have not not p. Hence existence of the colimit gives =20
(not p or not not p) for every p, which is not intuitionistically valid.

In fact one way to regard the set of truth values (i.e. the subobject =20=

classifier) is as the ideal completion of C.

Regards,

Steve.
