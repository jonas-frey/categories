         International Workshop "Structures and Deduction" (SD09)
          <http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~lutz/orgs/SD09.html>
                          July 20 - 24, 2009
                         organized as part of
                     the European Summer School on
                    Logic, Language and Information
                 ESSLLI 2009 <http://esslli2009.labri.fr/>
                     July 20 - 31, 2009 in Bordeaux
*******************************************************************

ORGANIZERS:

Michel Parigot (CNRS, Univ. Paris 7, France)
Lutz Strassburger (INRIA Saclay-IdF, France)


DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP:

The topic of this workshop is the application of algebraic, geometric,
and combinatorial methods in proof theory. In recent years many
researchers have proposed approaches to understand and reduce
"syntactic bureaucracy" in the presentation of proofs. Examples are
proof nets, atomic flows, new deductive systems based on deep
inference, and new algebraic semantics for proofs. These efforts have
also led to new methods of proof normalisation and new results in
proof complexity.

The workshop is relevant to a wide range of people. The list of topics
includes among others: algebraic semantics of proofs, game semantics,
proof nets, deep inference, tableaux systems, category theory,
deduction modulo, cut elimination, complexity theory, etc.

The goal of the workshop is twofold: first, to bring together
researchers from various fields who share the interest of
understanding and dealing with structural properties of proofs and
second, to provide an opportunity for PhD students and researchers to
present and discuss their work with colleagues who work in the broad
subject areas that are represented at ESSLLI.

The workshop is intended to be a sequel of the ICALP-workshop SD05 in
Lisbon 2005 <http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/ag/w/sd05>.


SUBMISSION DETAILS:

Contributions can be regular papers, but also work in progress,
programmatic/position papers or tutorials.  Submissions should be
formatted with the LNCS LaTeX style, take between two and fifteen
pages and allow the committee to assess their merits with reasonable
effort. The length limit can be relaxed for the versions that will be
presented at the workshop, depending on the total bulk of the accepted
contributions.

The accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published
by ESSLLI.  One author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop
in order to present the paper.


WORKSHOP FORMAT:

The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants.
It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive
days in the first week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 or 3 slots for paper
presentation and discussion per session. On the first day the workshop
organizers will give an introduction to the topic.


INVITED SPEAKERS:

Hi all,

An effective epimorphism is a map which is the quotient of its kernel
pair. I would like to use the term 'effective pretopology' to denote a
Grothendieck pretopology such that all the covers have the additional
property that they are effective epimorphisms (I'm assuming the
covering families consist of single maps). Has this been done before?


This seems to conflict a little with the notion of effective topology
as defined by Mike Barr in 'On categories with effective unions'.
There the notion of topology is an endomorphism of the subobject
functor. But perhaps someone can enlighten me on this.

Any monoid can be presented as an algebra (X in Set, h:TX->X) for the
monad T:Set->Set for monoids.  There's a 2-category with

- one object
- morphisms are lists of elements of X
- 2-morphisms out of a list f are all the different ways of collapsing
sublists of f using h

This construction works for algebras of any monad, not just the one
for monoids.  Does it have a name?

Hi,

thank you to those people who responded privately and gently reminded
me that the word I was looking for is 'subcanonical'. What I wrote
before is a definition equivalent to the usual one involving
representable presheaves

On a related note, I get tired of saying 'a pretopology where the
covering families consist of single maps'. Is there an established
word for this? If not, how about 'singleton pretopology'?

David Roberts

       realisability, categorical models
     * Implementation: Abstract machines, parallel execution, optimal
       reduction, type systems for program optimisation
     * Types: Subtypes, dependent types, type inference, polymorphism,
       types in theorem proving
     * Programming: Foundational aspects of functional and
       object-oriented programming, proof search and logic programming,
       connections between and combinations of functional and logic
       programming, type checking


The programme of TLCA'09 will consist of three invited talks (one common
with the Conference Rewriting Techniques and
Applications) and about 25 papers selected from original contributions.

Dear category theorists -

Thomson Scientific runs the well-known "Science Citation Index", which
"provides researchers, administrators, faculty, and students with quick,
powerful access to the bibliographic and citation information they need to
find relevant, comprehensive research data".  I believe data from this index
is used in tenure and promotion decisions at some universities.

I just heard that "Theory and Applications of Categories" and "Cahiers" are
not listed on the Science Citation Index, while - for example - Elsevier's
journal "Homeopathy" is listed there.

Is this true?  Is there some way to improve the situation?

Best,
jb

Don't know about Cahiers, but Bob has repeatedly tried to get them to
index TAC and it is like hitting a blank wall.

The editors of Mathematical Structures in Computer Science have just sent
a very strong letter to the EC which has decided to use the citation
indices (there are apparently more than one) in a formal way.  The
American editors seemed to say, that they were used very little for tenure
or hiring purposes in the US and, to my knowledge (from tenure decisions
at McGill but at least in the early 90s never used by the main granting
agencies.

But above and beyond that, there was a time when I was actually using the
citation index for its stated purpose.  It was when I was starting my work
on duality and I wanted to know to what extent the Pontrjagin duality had
been extended to classes of topological abelian groups larger than that of
locally compact groups.  Every useful for that, but not if it
gratuitously omits certain journals.

One of the strongest points made is that the citations often go to
derivative works rather than the original.  This is not malice on the part
of authors; often the derivative source is simply a better, clearer,
whatever, source than the original.

In a similar way, you cannot judge a mathematician from the number of his
students.  Gauss had only 8 students, and four of them, including three of
the best known (Dedekind, Sopie Germain, and Riemann had exactly none).
But he has, in toto, close to 45,000 descendants, over 70% of whom were
descendants of someone named Christain Gerling, whom I had never heard of
until I just looked it up.  My guess is that most of us are descended from
Gauss (I am).  Gustav Herglotz had 1278 descendants nearly all of whom
descend from one student: Emil Artin (my doktorgrandfather).

My point is that these things are simply not decent measures of value or
influence.  The ISI is useful for some things and useless for others,
including making this kind of judgment.  That's what people are good at.

Probably is and probably isn't.

I wrote a paper some years ago which eventually was published and the
journal is SCI listed. Our paper contained some keyword like monads and
n-categories and stuff, and we liked the paper, we still do. The reviewers
didn't always, but the editor eventually took the decision. In
correspondence with the editor it was like "... even if only a few in the
world will understand, it is not a reason not to publish ...". I should
say that the editor (thanks again!, if you read this, and my apologies for
using our correspondence as an example) saw the potential for
applications as well, which the reviewers did not.

Once in a while I communicate within the most theoretical communicates. I
feel humble and I realize how little I know, and I want to build upon
that. On the other hand, I want to build things that are useful, that
improves the world around me a little bit further. And I want to combine
the two!

Certainly, and please do not stand up and go just yet, certainly
categorists are doing great and also very very useful things. But simply,
is it enough? Can we do more? Do we reach out?

Why are computations efficient? Because we have grids. Why do aeroplanes
fly. Because we have matrices. And so on. It would be nice to hear
something like: How did we save global economy? With categories.

By the way, can anyone point at some category theory success stories, that
could be explained in evening news?

The category of finite sets and functions may be characterized (up to
equivalence) as the category with finite coproducts freely generated
from one object. Is there a similar nice characterization for the
category of finite sets and _injective_ functions?

Best regards,

Andrej

Dear Colleagues,

I think John asks a very good question! However:

While the Thomson Scientific's "Science Citation Index" could be related to
some commercial matters that I do not understand, Mathematical Reviews in
just Mathematical Reviews,

and for each of us it has "Author Profile",

and among other things it gives you the total number of citations on your
papers,

and if you click on "Citations", it lists citations,

and below the list there is "Reference List Journals",

and if you click on that, you will see a lot of journal titles,

but not "Theory and Applications of Categories", not "Cahiers", and not
"Applied Categorical Structures".

That is, according to Mathematical Reviews, the citations in Category Theory
journals are not citations!

I am sure this is not what Mathematical Reviews really wanted to do, and
that it must be corrected first of all.

George Janelidze

First announcement


A conference on


      Philosophy and Foundations of Mathematics -
       Epistemological and Ontological Aspects,


dedicated to Per Martin-L=F6f on the occasion of his retirement,
is to be held in

          Uppsala, Sweden, May 5-8, 2009
    at the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study.



Speakers:

Peter Aczel         Mark van Atten      Thierry Coquand
Peter Dybjer        Juliet Floyd        Jean-Yves Girard
Sten Lindstr=F6m      Colin McLarty       Per Martin-L=F6f
Peter Pagin         Erik Palmgren       Jan von Plato
Dag Prawitz         Christine Paulin    Aarne Ranta
Michael Rathjen     Giovanni Sambin     Anton Setzer
Stewart Shapiro     Wilfried Sieg       S=F6ren Stenlund
G=F6ran Sundholm      William Tait



The aim of the conference is to bring together philosophers,
mathematicians, and logicians to penetrate current and historically
important problems in the philosophy and foundations of
mathematics. Swedish logicians and philosophers have made important
contributions to the foundations and philosophy of mathematics, at
least since the end of the 1960s. In philosophy, one has been
concerned with the opposition between constructivism and classical
mathematics and the different ontological and epistemological views
that are reflected in this opposition. A central philosophical
question concerns the nature of the abstract entities of mathematics:
do they exist independently of our epistemic acts (realism, or
Platonism) or are they somehow constituted by these acts (idealism)?
Significant contributions have been made to the foundations of
mathematics, for example in proof theory, proof-theoretic semantics
and constructive type theory. These contributions have had a strong
impact on areas of computer science, e.g. through Martin-L=F6f's type
theory.

Two important alternative foundational programmes that are actively
pursued today are predicativistic constructivism and category-
theoretic foundations.  Predicativistic constructivism can be based on
Martin-L=F6f constructive type theory, Aczel's constructive set theory,
or similar systems. The practice of the Bishop school of constructive
mathematics fits well into this framework. Associated philosophical
foundations are meaning theories in the tradition of Wittgenstein,
Dummett, Prawitz and Martin-L=F6f. What is the relation between
proof-theoretical semantics in the tradition of Gentzen, Prawitz, and
Martin-L=F6f and Wittgensteinian or other accounts of meaning-as-use?
What can proof-theoretical analysis tell us about the scope and limits
of constructive and (generalized) predicative mathematics? To what
extent is it possible to reduce classical mathematical frameworks to
constructive ones? Such reductions often reveal computational content
of classical existence proofs. Is computational content enough to
solve the epistemological questions?

A central concern for the conference will be to compare the different
foundational frameworks - classical set theory, constructive type
theory, and category theory - both from a philosophical and a logical
point of view. The general theme of the conference, however, will be
broader and encompass different areas of philosophy and foundations of
mathematics, in particular the interplay between ontological and
epistemological considerations.

I would appreciate knowing the inventor of the concept of
filtered category, and the first source of the fact that
filtered colimits commute with finite limits in Set.

Thanks for help,

	That would be the one with one character per issue printed among 128
blank sheets, right?

Michael,

at least in the old days,
multiauthor papers were listed only once
e.g. Milnor and Stasheff
only under Milnor

Andrej,

You can say that finite sets and injective functions is (up-to =20
equivalence) the free symmetric monoidal category with an initial =20
unit, on one generator.

I think this is quite well known. I first learnt it from Marcelo =20
Fiore, a long time ago, and we referred to it in our paper

  Comparing Operational Models of Name-Passing Process Calculi
  Information and Computation vol 204. 2006.

I've also seen John Power refer to the result, e.g. in

  Semantics for Local Computational E=EF=AC=80ects
  MFPS XXII. ENTCS vol 158. 2006.

I am intrigued about what you will use the category for.

Sam

Considering the AMS's attitude to category theory, I assume that this is
what they meant to do.

George,

Has anyone brought this to the attention of MR?

Although Grothendieck did it only for directed sets and in abelian groups,
once he had done that the extension to sets was obvious and to filtered
categories not much more.  Five years later, when I sat in on Sammy's
course called homological algebra, but really category theory, he had the
full limit notion and I think must have talked about filtered index
categories (although I cannot quite remember it).

I haven't looked recently, but that was the way it was when I used it.  It
was a way of finding where a subject had gone, not who had led it there.
This is a total misuse of the index.

The category of finite sets and injective functions is the symmetric
monoidal category freely generated from one pointed object (i.e., from
one object A and one arrow I->A, where I is the tensor unit). -- Peter

It's the coaffine category (i.e. symmetric monoidal category whose
unit is initial) freely generated by one object.

See the following paper:

@article{Petric:substruct,
   author    = {Zoran Petric},
   title     = {Coherence in Substructural Categories},
   journal   = {Studia Logica},
   volume    = {70},
   number    = {2},
   year      = {2002},
   pages     = {271-296},
   bibsource = {DBLP, http://dblp.uni-trier.de}
}

[Note from moderator: For information, as publisher I have twice suggested
TAC to Thomson. Three years ago it was rejected after a long delay with no
explanation other than a reference to their "policy". When the suggestion
was renewed last summer via email and their web site mentioned below I
received no response at all, not even an acknowledgement, certainly no
gift card.]

Dear Colleagues,
   I wrote Thomson and asked how to find out what's covered, and also
how to request a journal be included. Below is a copy of the response
I received. I checked, and neither Cahiers nor T&AC are included (nor
is ENTCS, sad to say). I also took a brief look at the leading essay
on the ISI site about their rationalization for their selection
process. The bottom line in my view is that they provide this service
not for our needs, but for those who want quick and dirty guesstimates
of the importance of publications. Administrators like to use such
rankings, and publishers also focus on them, citing impact factor as a
major aspect of the importance of journals they publish. We can all go
to the site listed below to request that Cahiers and T&AC (and don't
forget ENTCS!!) be included, but I'm afraid this community is too
small to have an impact (sic) on this industry, so I think we should
look elsewhere for the needs we have to be met. Of course, there is
the lure of that $50 American Express gift card....
   Best regards,
   Mike Mislove

Dear All,=20

I did some investigation on this in 2003, but never got round to writing =
an article for the Notices AMS as was proposed.=20

I wrote to journals on the EMS list and asked their opinion of ISI. Some =
of the opinions were quite scathing. As Michael notes, dealing with ISI =
is like hitting a blank wall.=20

What ISI are trying to do is a little like Readers Digest: as ISI claim, =
they give the `Essential Science'. In practice, it seems they quickly =
put on their list journals from publishers (Homeopathy; Chaos, Solitons, =
Fractals;. ...) but put up all sorts of barriers to new independent =
journals. What does this show about the real aims of ISI?=20

They claim to have an assessment procedure for new journals, but what =
this procedure is remains undisclosed.=20

More discussion is given by Richard Poynder:=20

I wrote about this topic recently =
(http://poynder.blogspot.com/2008/11/open-access-question-of-quality_21.h=
tml).=20

This might also interest you, as it suggests there is a growing =
perception of the need to move beyond the impact factor:


http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/11/why_does_impact_factor_persist.php

It is not in ISI interests to take on more journals (more work, what =
reward?). It may be that they are using old technology (pre-Google?).=20

I looked on the Thomsons/ISI board once and found no academic =
representation. It is not clear that they have the expertise to do the =
job they claim to do. Unfortunately, many countreis accept their claims, =
and it is administratively convenient so to do.=20

A report by Charles Goldie for the LMS writes:

" The last few paragraphs suggest one general point, not specific to =
mathematics, that I hope the CMS response can take up, which is that the =
citation studies planned by HEFCE to be its main indicators depend on =
data from a private overseas corporation with no responsi=ADbility to =
the UK whatsoever. The way the data are organised by the Thomson =
Corporation (choice of fields, selection of journals for inclusion, =
allocation to fields) has considerable prior consequences for what it is =
feasible to do with the data, and hence for what indicators HEFCE or =
their agents might wish to employ. For the research future of this =
country to be determined to a large extent in this way is absolutely =
craven, and seems to me simply shame=ADful."=20

Thus there is considerable doubt that ISI are doing what could be called =
a professional academic job, though it might be called `professional' if =
the aim is simply to make money from data organised in a  way whose =
toxic potentiality is not easily open to view.=20

Charles  wrote to me:

"As you'll see, part of what I found was that Thomson Scientific's
classification of journals into fields has no coherence or logic.
Algebra Colloquium is classed as Applied Mathematics!"

The other point is that `great oaks from little acorns grow'. A new but =
vital area may have little `impact factor'. ISI procedures, and their =
acceptance for research evaluation,  are unfavourable to new =
initiatives, and trends.=20

Unfortunately, the discussion of how mathematics progresses, and how new =
ideas grow, the context, is not usually part of the study of mathematics =
for students, and my impression is there is little developed language to =
cope with this. (Music degrees allow for study of performance, =
musicology, composition, ..Can we learn from this?) See discussion in =
various articles on
www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/publar.html
particularly perhaps `The methodology of mathematics'. Comments and =
argument welcome! But I have found the views of `top people' (in the UK, =
FRS's) can be very naive, the `Groupoids is rubbish' school of thought, =
or `the van Kampen programme is a ridiculous programme', etc., etc.=20

If anyone would like more information to pursue this ISI matter, I am =
happy to help. My problem is that I have some writing priorities and am =
a bit too old to divert my attention too much.=20

But obviously it is bad news for the progress of mathematics if the EC =
is taken in by what ISI themselves say they do, rather than by an =
analysis of what they actually do. Please forward this to the EC if it =
might help!

Dear Andrej,

Here are a few:

1. It's the symmetric monoidal category freely generated by a pointed object
(i.e. an object X with a map I-->X where I is the unit for the monoidal
structure).

2. It's the "symmetric monoidal category with I=0" freely generated by an
object.

3. It's the monoidal category freely generated by an object X equipped with
an involution s:X^2-->X^2 satisfying the braid relations and a morphism
i:I-->X satisfying s.Xi=s.iX.

Steve.

I thank everyone who answered. The answer is "the free symmetric
monoidal category with an initial unit generated by one object". Some
were curious to know what I am doing with the category.

In a study of generalizations of relational databases with a student
of mine we found that a good category to use for describing schemata
(shapes of relations) is the category whose objects look like freely
generated coproducts and the morphisms are injective functions. So I
now know that this category is the freely generated symmetric monoidal
category with an initial unit generated by the set of types that may
appear in a schema. Thank you.

Best regards,

Andrej

In Sets+Injective functions (Inj?) the disjoint sum A+B obeys a =20
universal property which is slightly more restricted than coproduct:

given two maps  A ---> C <--- B such that their pullback is empty, =20
then there exists a unique  A+B ----> C with the usual coproduct-=20
filler property.

So I guess that if you look for the free category with one generator =20
object, pullbacks, initial object and a bifunctor+natural =20
transformations with that universal property, you will get FInj, but =20
that has to be ascertained.

Hope that helps,

There are two universal characterisations of the category of finite sets
and injections:

I - It is the free symmetric monoidal category on one generator, with an
initial unit.

II - It is the free symmetric monoidal category on one generator G, with
a monoidal indeterminate x: I -> G.


In both cases, the symmetric monoidal structure is given by finite
coproducts.

The general notion of 'monoidal indeterminates' requires some spelling
out, but should be clear enough in this simple case.

II implies I above; it follows from a general construction of monoidal
indeterminates subject to a naturality constraint (which is trivial in
this case).

Claudio Hermida

In many countries, Slovenia included, the SCI is used in a formal way
in government funding decisions, as well as in decisions about
promotions at our university. My colleagues and I in Ljubljana simply
must publish in journals that are on the SCI index, otherwise the
publication is hardly recognized at all ('8 points' for top half of
SCI versus '2 points' for being in Math Reviews). To add insult to
injury practically all journals on SCI are of the kind that steals our
work, funded by public money, and resells it back to the public.
Nobody is even attempting to explain to the government what the
problem is.

If anyone has a plan on how to break the grip, I would like to hear it.

So even if I wrote papers in category theory, I would/could not
publish them in TAC because it is not in SCI.

Best regards,

Andrej

Hello category theorists,

just to report that in Spain, Thomson's Science Citation Index is now
the main measure of quality of publication in mathematics: every report
and application has to indicate impact factor(*) and citation count(**) o=
f=20
all one's papers -- and papers in journals not indexed (or in conference
proceedings) simply don't count as papers!  As a concrete example, I
received last year an evalutation from the Ministry of Science and
Education explicitly telling me that I need to improve the number of
papers published in indexed journals.

(*) Impact factor is really a silly measure for quality: for example
many learned societies distribute papers into several different journals
only according to length but using otherwise the same criteria for
acceptance, whereas those different journals can have very different
impact factors in Thomson's index.  (It may interest some of you that
the Elsevier journal CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS edited by El Naschie has a=
=20
higher impact factor than Annals of Mathematics.)

(**) Of course the citation count is Thomson's count, which counts only
citations from Thomson indexed papers, and even fails to identify
preprint citations to papers later indexed.  (E.g. paper A cites preprint
B.  When B is published in an indexed journal the citation from A does
not count.)

It has a very bad effect, especially on young researchers, who have to
follow the rules of Thomson's and Ministry's game, and look up impact
factors before choosing which journal to submit to, instead of following
scientific criteria.


Furthermore, access to Thomson's database is not free.  (The Spanish
Ministry has paid access for all Spanish universities, instead of using
that money to fund research.)  It is more than likely that Thomson is
affiliated in some way with Elsevier and other publishing houses -- in
any case they share the same goals of extracting money from science
budgets -- and therefore free journals represent a threat, and it is not
very likely that any free electronical journal will be included in
Thomson's index.  It did happen with 'Geometry & Topology', though...

I agree with George that it is important to get TAC and Cahiers into the
AMS citation database.  This should be possible just by scientific
reasons.  Before that happens I think there is not much hope to enter
Thomson's index...

The real problem is to convince science foundations and other funding
agencies to boycott Thomson.  Just getting more and more good journals
into Thomson's index is not going to help with that :-(

Gettting the categories journals into the AMS citation database will
help providing a strong alternative to Thomson.

Cheers,
Joachim.

This isn't really surprising: it is just another hint, that it is
easier to get a weak journal - published by a commercial publisher -
on the ISI list than a strong one, if the latter is published
independently.

Ronnie,

The AMS staff shoudl be doing this.
May I forward your msg to them
or just suggest they get on the ball?

Fields Institute Workshop Announcement:

Smooth Structures in Logic, Category Theory and Physics

University of Ottawa
May 1-3, 2009


Abstract categorical approaches and analogies with the differential
calculus and the theory of smooth manifolds arise in a number of diverse
areas of mathematics.  For example, the well-known fact that the category
of manifolds and smooth maps fails to be cartesian closed motivated both
the theory of convenient vector spaces due to Froelicher, Kriegl, and
Michor, and work on categories of smooth spaces initiated by Chen and
Souriau.  In topos theory, synthetic differential geometry, developed by
Lawvere, Kock, Moerdijk, Reyes, and others, provides an appealing abstract
setting for differential geometry using the theory of nilpotent
infinitesimals.  In logic, the differential lambda-calculus, due to
Ehrhard and Regnier, was inspired by considerations from linear logic,
differential calculus, and work on locally convex topological models of
linear logic.  This theory subsequently gave rise to the recent
development of differential categories by Blute, Cockett, and Seely.  In
topology, the Goodwillie calculus, which also has connections with the
study of smooth manifolds, is an example of a ``calculus of functors''
drawing inspiration from differential calculus.  And in theoretical
physics, recent work by Baez and Schreiber on higher gauge theory exploits
some of these more abstract versions of differential geometry in order to
avoid technical difficulties implicit in the theory of
infinite-dimensional manifolds.

The Logic and Foundations of Computing group at the University of Ottawa
is happy to announces a workshop, supported by the Fields Institute, which
aims to bring together researchers from these different areas in order to
encourage further interaction in the study of smooth structures in logic,
category theory and physics.  In addition to the main invited lectures,
several of the invited speakers will give tutorials on their areas of
expertise in order to make the subject accessible to students and other
new researchers in the area.  The (confirmed) invited speakers are:

* John Baez (UC Riverside)
* Kristine Bauer (Calgary)
* Thomas Ehrhard (PPS Paris)
* Anders Kock (Aarhus)
* Andrew Stacey (NTNU Norway)


Some student support from the Fields Institute will be available.  There
will also be some time reserved in the schedule for a selection of
contributed talks.  Further details regarding student support and
contributed talks can be found on the workshop webpage:

As an example of how some governments may indeed be tempted to use ISI
information for tenure and promotion decision, Iet me mention what
happened in Portugal some years ago. There was a short-lived social-
democrat government in Portugal whose science minister (a professor
from IST's mechanical engineering department) proposed to base the
evaluation of scientific production on a simple formula. The formula
originally included niceties such as requiring every scientist,
whatever his field, to publish an average of four papers per year ---
ranging from social sciences to chemistry (!!!) More, these papers
were supposed to be published in ISI cited papers.

A series of fierce complaints from the portuguese scientific community
followed, in an attempt at least to fix the formula by providing
realistic expectations regarding average numbers of publications
according to field. The requirement that publications be ISI-indexed
was probably going to be retained, though, except that the government
was short-lived and the whole evaluation system was swiftly (and
fortunately) replaced by a more effective peer review system.

About that time I learned from Ronnie Brown that he had had some
correspondence with Eugene Garfield (the founder of ISI) and in
particular had mentioned to him how SCI seemed to be used in some
countries in order to assess scientific production. Garfield's reply
was crisp and clear: "The SCI was not designed for that
purpose" (these may not have been the exact words, but it was the
spirit as far as I remember).

Why some governments will insist on (mis)using such a commercial tool
is not completely clear. My guess is that in some cases this is a
consequence of lack of understanding of how science works, on the part
some political decision makers. Certainly the need to cut on expenses
must play a role, too.

Best,
Pedro.

Dear mathematicians,

could anybody give me a hint if the following assertion is true?
Let V be a complete and co-complete symmetric monoidal closed category. The
category sV of simplicial objects in V is also complete and co-complete
symmetric monoidal closed with the pointwise tensor. There is a V-adjunction
D:V<-->sV:Z
of the V-functor Z which evaluates in 0 and the discrete V-functor D. Does
this induce a V-Isomorphism of V-categories
V-Fun(K,ZC)~sV-Fun(DK,C)
for any small V-category K and any sV-category C?

Please note that a similar statement is true for the non-enriched case [e.g.
Borceux2, Proposition 6.4.8.].

Thank you for any help.

Tony

It's just so easy for a bureaucrat to be able to back up an arbitrary

There is also available the report from the IMU as follows:

http://www.mathunion.org/publications/report/citationstatistics/

It should be emphasised  that the ethics and practice of citation for an
individual paper are unclear and probably untaught, except possibly through
the admonishments of editors. Certainly scholarship in itself is generally
unrewarded. What gets the most fame is a solution to a famous problem; and
this is partly because the judgement of the achievement is easy, and could
almost be set up as a computer program, as for tennis rankings. Opening new
areas, or problem formulation, gives a more difficult task to assess: as
they say, predicting the future has its problems. And it may take many years
or decades for the true implications to sink in.

Should a citation be to the original paper, or to the most recent and
possibly best exposition (the latest author has the advantage of someone
else doing the spadework)? There is always an attraction in citing a famous
author, which gives a certain cachet, even if the idea came from someone
relatively unknown. There is the practice of changing terminology, so that
the original paper looks old fashioned, and in any case dealt with oomla
when `everyone' nowadays calls it bamloo.

How far back in the history of an idea or technique should citations go?

There is no established framework for good practice in citations dealing
with all these matters.

Thus the idea of using citations as a basis for assessment of importance is
hazardous in the extreme. This is emphasised in the IMU report.

Will the national Mathematical Societies be prepared to speak out publicly
on these key issues; or be willing to beard the Thomson/ISI lion; or subject
the basis of what ISI call `Essential Science' to ridicule; or state
publicly that the ISI journal evaluation process has little open quality
assurance?

Jim:

The IMU-IMS-ICIAM report was widely circulated, pushed out to government and
university bureauacracies, and republished in many places throughout the
world. (The AMS Notices only wanted to publish the executive summary -- not
my call, of course, because the Notices has an independent editor-in-chief.)
There is really not much more one can do other then educate people. None of
these organizations, nor any societies, have the power to force people to
use common sense.

I have talked about citation statistics to several groups, one of which was
the NIH. Surprisingly, they were very receptive to the idea that one had to
use citation statistics with care. People in the biological sciences, with a
citation culture, seem to understand this.

On the other, the otherwise mild report has drawn intense negative reaction
from many other places, with headlines to stories along the lines of
"Confused mathematicians" and "Mish-Maths Statistics" and so forth. There is
a huge enterprise behind citation statistics, and it includes a large part
of the scientific community -- people who enthisiastically promote the use
of citation data as a substitute for peer review. Parts of the mathematical
sciences are included in this effort (most prominently, statistics itself).
I've learned a lot from the reaction to the report, and in some ways I've
learned more from the reaction than from the work itself.

The original hope was that a sensible report from a respected international
body would help to persuade people to use common sense. In some places, that
worked. In many others, it's clearly had little or no effect.

Of course, the misuse of statistics in a world gone mad to quantify every
aspect of life extends far beyond citation statistics. I sometimes yearn for
the better days of the past ... a sure sign I'm growing old.

Subject: citation indices

john,

I've received lots of sad stories about misuse of ISI Citation Index
for hiring,promotion, tenure and even orders about where to publish.
After the IMU report, what is being done to counter this pernicious
influence?

Dear Tony,

Yes, it is true. More generally, let F-|U:W-->V be a monoidal adunction.

This means that V and W are monoidal categories, F and U are monoidal
functors, monoidal natural transformations 1-->UF and FU-->1 satisfying the
triangle equations.

(A monoidal functor F:V-->W involves maps FX\otimes FY-->F(X\otimes Y)
and I_W-->F(I_V), not necessarily invertible, but satisfying coherence
conditions. In a monoidal adjunction, as above, the monoidal functor F is
necessarily strong, so that the comparison maps are invertible. The
comparison maps for U need not be invertible.)

For a small V-category K and a W-category C we do indeed have an isomorphism
    V-Fun(K,UC) = U(W-Fun(FK,C))
of V-categories. I'll do my best to explain this via ascii.


V-functors from K to UC are in bijection with W-functors from FK to C; this
takes care of the object-part. For V-functors M,N:K-->UC,
the hom-object V-Fun(K,UC)(M,N) is the equalizer of the evident maps
               --->
Pi_k UC(Mk,Nk) ---> Pi_{k,l} [K(k,l), UC(Mk,Nl)]
in V, where the products run over all objects k and l of K.

On the other hand, U(W-Fun(FK,C)(M,N)) is given by the equalizer of
                 -->
U(Pi_k C(Mk,Nk)) --> U Pi_{k,l} [FK(k,l),C(Mk,Nl)]
or equivalently, since U is a left adjoint, the equalizer of
               -->
Pi_k UC(Mk,Nk) --> Pi_{k,l} U[FK(k,l),C(Mk,Nl)]

So we are now left to prove

Lemma: U[FX,Y]=[X,UY], for X in V and Y in W.
Proof:

V(Z,U[FX,Y]) = W(FZ,[FX,Y]) = W(FZ\otimes FX,Y) = W(F(Z\otimes X),Y)
             = V(Z\otimes X,UY) = V(Z,[X,UY])

naturally in Z and so U[FX,Y]=[X,UY] as required.

Regards,

Steve Lack.

Dear Colleagues,

The discussion on citation indices is interesting and important, but may I
protest a bit?:

Of course we all know that it does not make sense to judge mathematicians by
numbers of publications and/or citations. But it does not mean that the
number (and the list) of citations on your and my papers given in
Mathematical Reviews should be

the number (and the list) of citations in non-category-theory journals!

Therefore the task number one here is not to argue about general
improvements of various indices, but to convince Mathematical Reviews to
include TAC, Cahiers, and APCS in what Mathematical Reviews calls "Reference
List Journals". Jim, any success?

If it is as bad as Michael Barr says, well, it least we will know that we
made an attempt - and then, who knows, may be Categorical Reviews will be
created one day...

Next, if you allow me to propose task number two, it could be to try again
(using MR) to include the same journals to various lists including
Thompson's list (APCS is already there though) - not because it will help us
to judge ourselves and each other, but simply because there are those funny
bureaucratic requirements of many universities in many countries.

This remark is quite off-topic for this list, yet may be taken into
account by those members who want to take action about this ranking
issue.

The situation is somewhat similar within other fields of knowledge
and is not limited to science. Indeed, I attended a literature
colloquium a few weeks ago, during which there was a short talk
dealing with this topic.

The speaker, apparently reacting to a decision which applies to
European researchers in his field, described a society in which
researchers, in order to be well-ranked, would ask their relatives
and friends to click frantically on their names and articles in
Google, then pay people to do that fulltime to get higher ranks (in
developing countries to reduce the cost).

A reknown critic and professor, quite influential (at least here in
France), replied that it was perfectly justified to use ranking
methods because these had proved efficient in the field of "pure
sciences". (I do not remember the words she used.) Unfortunately, I
was too abashed to answer.

The reason why I am writing this is that I think researchers should
take interdisciplinary action, if any. Indeed, this issue is more
sociological or political than scientific, and therefore I am not
sure mathematicians have the power to address it on their own.

Regards,

Jonathan

           TOPOLOGY, ALGEBRA AND CATEGORIES IN LOGIC (TACL 2009)
===============================================================================

                          7-11 July 2009
              Institute for Logic, Language and Computation
                      University of Amsterdam
                          the Netherlands
                   http://www.illc.uva.nl/tacl09/



Scope
-----
Studying logics via semantics is a well-established and very active
branch of mathematical logic, with many applications, in computer
science and elsewhere. The area is characterized by results, tools
and techniques stemming from various fields, including universal
algebra, topology, category theory, order, and model theory. The
program of the conference TACL 2009 will focus on three
interconnecting mathematical themes central to the semantical study
of logics and their applications: algebraic, categorical, and
topological methods. This is the fourth conference in the series
Topology, Algebra and Categories in Logic (TACL, formerly TANCL).
Earlier installments of this conference have been organized in
Tbilisi (2003), Barcelona (2005), and Oxford (2007).


Featured topics
---------------
Contributed talks can deal with any topic falling under the scope of the
meeting. This includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:

* Algebraic logic
* Coalgebraic semantics
* Categorical methods in logic
* Domain theory
* Fuzzy and many-valued logics
* Lattices with operators
* Modal logics
* Non-classical logics
* Ordered topological spaces
* Ordered algebraic structures
* Pointfree topology
* Residuated structures
* Stone-type dualities
* Substructural logics
* Topological semantics of modal logic


Submissions
-----------
Contributed presentations will be of two types: 20 minutes long
presentations in parallel sessions and featured, 30 minutes long,
plenary presentations. The submission of an abstract of 1-4 pages is
required to be selected for a contributed presentation of either
kind. While preference will be given to new work, results that have
already been published or presented elsewhere will also be
considered. More information on the submission procedure is
available on the conference website.

The thing I don't understand about citation indexes is, what is the
barrier to entry here?  For any field naturally associated to a
university department (physics, mathematics, chemistry, history,
English), what is to stop that field deciding that in the interest of
fairness to all professionals working in the field whose work is subject
to review, for example junior faculty, it is going to run its own
citation index subscribing to a set of technical and ethical standards
that it makes public and holds itself to, e.g. via ISO 9000
certification?  It then actively works to promote the use of its index
by reviewing bodies, in competition with the existing citation indexes
run for profit.

Usually reviewers in any given field are reluctant to confess to
depending on citation indexes as a labor saving device.  However when a
field has acknowledged the efficiency of doing so and has set up an
adequately run index serving that need, and a review states that the
only citation index if any resorted to by the reviewer was the field's
own, the credibility of that review is enhanced even though the reviewer
has not stated whether he or she actually used that index.

Reviewers should not be asked to reveal actual use of an index because
that information could prejudice users of the review against reviewees
whose reviewers felt the need to resort to an index, since that could be
taken as a sign of non-notability, of questionable relevance to a
reviewee's performance.  Obviously one wants to hire and retain the most
famous people, but they've all gone to the highest bidder.  More
significantly, fields lose credibility in the eyes of other fields when
they put notability ahead of competence.  Most of all, they lose
effectiveness when they do not give due credit to researchers whose low
profile keeps them below the radar of reviewers yet who are nonetheless
valuable players.  MVP can mean either most valuable player or most
visible player, and these need not always be the same thing in subjects
that don't have 80,000 readers of each and every scientific article.

Because the field's index is working for the benefit of the field more
than for its own profit, it can and should maintain two-way contact with
those working in the field, by encouraging them to contribute suitably
formatted information listing and classifying their identifiable
contributions, as an extension of their CV.  In this way CV's need no
longer be isolated documents but instead become coordinated with the
field's index, whose maintenance becomes the joint responsibility of the
researcher and the index.  This divides the labor that hitherto has had
to be duplicated to a considerable degree at both ends, potentially
halving the cost of this part of the review process.

Done properly, these field indexes will consume resources of course, but
these can be underwritten in the same way that the for-profit indexes
make their money, namely by charging for them at rates competitive with
the established indexes, but with the additional edge of being
supplemented by subsidies from the homes of the appointment and
promotion committees whose work will in consequence be of a higher
quality than it presently is today and who therefore can reasonably make
that case to their provost or HR department.

Many fields already maintain their own indexes, which should in
principle be relatively easy to upgrade to the standards suggested here
compared to having to start from scratch, to the extent that the field
is adequately coordinated with the indexes it considers itself to be
operating.  An index purportedly serving a field that is not responsive
to the field's membership should be disowned by the field and an index
competing with it set up.  Such a threat should motivate any field's
existing indexes that can see which side their bread is buttered on to
play ball.

There is the tricky question of what to do with multiple established
indexes operated independently but at least nominally under a field's
control.  One approach is to select one of them as the one responsible
for the functions proposed here, but if they are complementary then some
sort of coordination between them producing an effect sufficient for
those purposes may be a better solution, as being less disruptive to
their complementarity, whose benefits should be clear to all duality
theorists.

Once a field's index has been accepted by an institution, and becomes
the primary if not only reference for all who need to consult such
indexes, the institution's library need feel under no obligation to
maintain their subscriptions to competing indexes serving that field.
The above-mentioned institutional subsidies can then be drawn at least
in part from those savings, an added efficiency of this system.

Indexes run according to these principles should strongly incentivize
all who stand to benefit from their quality to contribute to that
quality according to their roles.

The extant indexes can complain all they want about uncompetitive
practices, but at bottom they are the ones who brought this unwanted
competition on themselves by operating an inferior product.  Pragmatic
governments do not legislate in competition with Darwin's law of
survival of the fittest because in economics that law trumps all others.
  Governments that legislate at odds with Darwin's law fall victim to
it, as we saw with Russia.  Western civilization has not intentionally
legislated against the interests of fair competition for a long time
now, preferring to legislate against unfair competition by imposing
tariffs (the bludgeon), passing antitrust laws (the rapier), etc.

NEW since 1st CFP: Submissions open, RDP workshops, RTA invited speakers.
*************************************************************************

The 20th International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications
(RTA 2009) is organized as part of the Federated Conference on Rewriting,
Deduction, and Programming (RDP 2009), together with the International
Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA 2009), and the
workshops HOR'09, LSFA'09, RULE'09, WFLP'09, and WRS'09. The conference
will be preceded by the 4th International School on Rewriting (ISR).

Brasilia, the federal capital of Brazil, is listed as a World Heritage
Site by UNESCO.  RDP 2009 will be held at Universidade de Brasilia,
one of the largest and one of the most prestigious universities in
Brazil, on a campus built by highly acclaimed architect Oscar Niemeyer.
Brasilia is easily reached by plane; air fares are moderate at that time
of the year.

   higher-order rewriting; constrained rewriting/deduction; categorical and
   infinitary rewriting; integration of decision procedures;

 * Implementation: implementation techniques; parallel execution; rewrite
   tools; termination checking;

 * Semantics: equational logic; rewriting logic; rewriting models of
   programs.

elsewhere. Submissions must fall into one of the following categories
(to be indicated at submission):

1. Regular Research Papers: describing new results; they will be judged
   on correctness and significance.

2. Papers describing the experience of applying rewriting techniques in
   other areas; they will be judged on relevance and comparison with
   other approaches.

3. Problem sets that provide realistic and interesting challenges in
   the field of rewriting.

4. System descriptions; they should contain a link to a working system
   and will be judged on usefulness and design.

All submissions will be judged on originality and quality of
presentation. Submissions in the first three categories can be up to
15 proceedings pages long, system descriptions up to 10 proceedings
pages. Additional material, for instance proof details, may be given
in an appendix which is not subject to the limitation of
pages. However, submissions must be self-contained within the
respective page limit; reading the appendix should not be necessary to
access the merits of a submission.

Submissions are accepted in either Postscript or PDF format.  Authors
are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX2e and the Springer llncs class

The lectures are aimed at graduate students, typically in their first
or second year of study for a PhD. However, the school is open to
anyone who is interested in learning more about mathematical computing
foundations. We very much welcome international applications as well
as from those from the UK.

FINANCIAL SUPPORT

We have 20 EPSRC funded places with substantially reduced fees.

Dear Professor Stasheff,

Your message has been forwarded to my attention.

Reference lists appear in MathSciNet from journals included in the Mathematical
Reviews Citation Database. These journals are selected through an editorial
process that includes approval by the Mathematical Reviews Editorial Committee
(MREC). Citation Database reference list journals are reexamined each year in
October. The list of current Citation Database reference list journals can be
found at: http://www.ams.org/mrcitations/journal_list.html.

Please feel free to send me specific examples of journals you might have in
mind and I will forward them to MREC for their consideration. Let me know
if you have further questions.

Sincerely,
Calista Stafford

I am responding to Vaughan's long message (which I won't bother
repeating).  The AMS has set up its own citation index but we have seen
that they too will not include TAC (I am not sure about Cahiers).  They
have a long-standing and apparently immutable prejudice against category
theory and nothing can change that.  As for a field as small as category
theory setting up its own index, that would seem to be a non-starter.
Even if we were to do it, the bureaucrats of the EC would not accept since
it would be seen as self-serving.

After reading that the Springer journal Homeopathy is indexed, I began to
wonder if the publisher pays ISI for inclusion.  I am sure that this kind
of information is kept secret.  (Actually, Robert Dawson has wildly
exaggerated the publication of Homeopathy: the truth is that one out of
every 10^{100} numbers contains one pixel of ink and the remaining issues
are blank.)

Does anyone know anything about when functors E:C-->D have the property that
the functor Lan_E:[C,Set]-->[D,Set] given  by left Kan extension
is comonadic?

Actually I'm interested in something a bit more general. Let E:C-->D be a
functor. I'm happy to suppose that it is bijective on objects and faithful.
Then Lan_E has a right adjoint, given by
restriction along E. Let W be the induced comonad on [D,Set], and [D,Set]^W
its category of coalgebras. The comparison K:[C,Set]-->[D,Set]^W has a right
adjoint R, constructed using equalizers in [C,Set]. Comonadicity would mean
that this adjunction is an equivalence; what I really want to know is
when/whether R is fully faithful, so that K is a reflection onto a full
subcategory. (This is equivalent to Lan_E preserving the equalizers which
are used to construct R.)

This seems like something topos theorists might know about.

Steve.

Dear George,

Naturally I agree that the "Cahiers" be included in the list.

Since many years, the Math. Reviews ask me to send them 2 free copies
of each issue of the "Cahiers", which I do regularly, and the papers
in the "Cahiers" are analysed and figure in their authors'list of
publication (at least for those I have verified). However I have just
seen that the "Cahiers" as such are not in the list of journals and I
am going to write them to have an explanation.

With all my best wishes for the new year,
Warm regards
Andree

Dear Jim,

I think what you did is extremely useful, also because it will make the
views of MR on category theory very clear. My list below contains APCS in
addition to the two journals everybody mentions. It does not contain HHA =
and
JHRS, not because I have anything against them, but because we are
explicitly talking about category theory now (according to your message t=
o
MR).

For MR citations is at

http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/mrcit/journal_list.html

but requires mathscinet access
which I have via upenn proxy

if you do not have access to mathscinet
let me know a journal or two you would like me to check on

Dear Steve,

With regard to your query, I reproduce a message sent by
Peter Johnstone to this list in March 2007 providing
sufficient (and possibly necessary?) conditions for Lan_E to
be comonadic.

"A further attempt to provide a general context for Richard's
observation: let f: C --> D be a functor between small
categories having a right multi-adjoint in the sense of
Diers, i.e. such that, for each object b of D, the comma
category (f \downarrow b) is a disjoint union of categories
with terminal objects. (Note that this is always the case
when C is discrete, as in the example considered by Richard,
since then the (f \downarrow b) are also discrete.) Then the
left Kan extension functor f_!: [C,Set] --> [D,Set] can be
constructed using only coproducts rather than more general
colimits, from which it follows easily that it is faithful
and preserves equalizers. Hence it is comonadic. (I suspect
that this may be a necessary as well as a sufficient
condition for comonadicity of f_!, but I don't yet have a
proof.)"

With best wishes,

Richard

David Eppstein, a regular contributor to Wikipedia, asked me recently
about background relevant to his recent work on the Birkhoff duality of
finite posets and finite distributive lattices.  This resulted in
several exchanges that can be seen at

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Vaughan_Pratt#Birkhoff.27s_representation_theorem

His last message requested citable references concerning my explanation
of the duality.  The best I could come up with was Peter Johnstone's
*Stone Spaces*, which is where I learned about these particular
dualities.  However my answer to his earlier question was phrased in
what I felt was more elementary language than used by Peter (but of
course "elementary" is in the eye of the beholder).

My question here is, where in the literature is there an account of
Birkhoff/Stone duality in terms of homming into schizophrenic objects at
a level comparable to my detailed reply to David?  The concept itself
can be presented at a very elementary level, but the expositions of it
that I'm aware of presume a degree of sophistication of the reader out
of proportion to what the concepts should require in this case.

If Peter's book is indeed the most elementary account available I'll
settle for that.  Whatever's available.

Vaughan

Dear Jim,

There should be mention of Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.
Although it's not exclusively about category theory, categories have
always played a prominent role in the mathematical structures used.

Regards,

Steve Vickers.

After a number of requests, I have written up a proof that every biequivalence
in Bicat is part of a biadjoint biequivalence.  It can be found at the
following address.

http://gauss.math.yale.edu/~mg622/biadjdraft.pdf

The result still holds in a general tricategory and I am in the process of
writing up the full proof.

Paper Submissions
-----------------

ICTAC 2009  calls for two types  of contributions: RESEARCH PAPERS and
TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS. Both types  of contributions will appear in
the  LNCS   proceedings    and have    oral     presentations at   the
conference. Papers should be written in English in LNCS format.

RESEARCH PAPERS:

Research   papers  should  contain  original  research, and sufficient
detail to   assess  the merits  and  relevance  of  the  contribution.=20
Submissions  reporting on  industrial  case  studies are welcome,  and
should  describe both  strengths and  weaknesses  in sufficient depth.=20
Research papers should be no more than 15 pages.

TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS:

Tool demonstration    papers present  tools   based on  aforementioned
theories or fall into the above  application areas. Tool demonstration
papers allow researchers to  stress the technical and practical  side,
illustrating how one    can   apply the  theoretic  contributions   in
practice. Tool demonstration papers should be no more than 6 pages.

As  usual, submissions to the conference  must not have been published
or    be  concurrently   considered  for  publication   elsewhere. All
submissions will  be judged on  the basis of originality, contribution
to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the
conference.  Submission constitutes a commitment to attend and present
a paper, if accepted.

Proceedings  of ICTAC 2009 will be  published by Springer  in the LNCS
series.

We are pleased to announce the following conference:

      Models, Logics and Higher-Dimensional Categories:
         A tribute to the work of Mihaly Makkai

                  19, 20 June 2009

at Centre de Recherche Math\'ematique (CRM) in Montreal

Since the mid 1970s there has been a remarkably successful marriage of ideas
and techniques between category theory on the one hand and model theory and
logic on the other.  This was first distilled in the 1977 monograph "First
Order Categorical Logic"  by M Makkai and G Reyes, which successfully combined
traditional model theory with Grothendieck toposes. In the succeeding years,
Makkai has built up an impressive body of work in several related fields:
categorical model theory, first order logic with dependent sorts, higher
dimensional category theory, and most importantly, a coherent and far reaching
view of categorical logic in mathematical foundations.

Such a meeting is timely for several reasons: not only the occasion of Makkai's
70th birthday year, but also because recently there has been a widening
consensus that traditional model theory might usefully embrace the categorical
methods he pioneered.  Traditional model theory is set-based; in contrast,
there has been an increasing use of category-theoretic (specifically including
sheaf-theoretic) contexts and techniques in recent model-theoretic work in such
areas as algebraic geometry, differential algebra, Mordell-Lang theory, etc.

The focus of the meeting will be traditional model theory, categorical model
theory and logics, and higher-dimensional category theory (the main themes in
Makkai's research career).  We hope to have a number of Michael's former and
current collegues and students as speakers at the meeting, including the
following invited speakers:

Mike Barr
Victor Harnik
Bradd Hart
Andre Joyal
Hal Kierstead
Julia Knight
Francois Lamarche
Robert Par\'e
Anand Pillay
Gonzalo Reyes
Charles Steinhorn
Marek Zawadowski

There may be time for some short contributed talks; if that is possible, we
shall issue a call for proposals when we can.

For further information, please email either Phil Scott <phil@site.uottawa.ca>
or Robert Seely <rags@math.mcgill.ca> (local organizers).

Dear all,

Recently we have noticed that there is an error in the paper "Traced
Monoidal Categories" by Joyal, Street and Verity, published in 1996.
It is about the bidjointness of the Int-construction and, to our best
knowledge, never pointed out before. We think that it is of some
interest for quite a few people, as this biadjointness is widely known
and frequently quoted in the literature, especially in various work in
theoretical computer science.

In the paper by JSV, it is claimed that (in Proposition 5.2) the
Int-construction gives a left biadjoint of the inclusion of the
2-category TortMon (of tortile monoidal categories, balanced monoidal
functors and monoidal natural transformations) in the 2-category
TraMon (of traced monoidal categories, traced strong monoidal functors
and monoidal natural transformations). However, we found that the
statement is not quite correct. There is a simple counterexample:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counterexample:
Let N=(N,0,+,\leq) be the traced partially ordered set of natural
numbers. Then Int(N) is equivalent to the compact closed partially
ordered set Z=(Z,0,+,-,\leq) of integers. The biadjointness would say
that TraMon(N,Z) is equivalent to TortMon(Int(N),Z), which in turn is
equivalent to TortMon(Z,Z).
However, some calculation shows that TraMon(N,Z) is isomorphic to the
partially ordered set of natural numbers, while TortMon(Z,Z) is
isomorphic to a discrete category with countably many objects.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

JSV's proof was almost perfect, except the very last three lines where
some details on 2-cells were missing/wrong.

We think that the easiest (and possibly the only) way to recover the
biadjointness is to modify the definition of TraMon as the 2-category
of traced monoidal categories, traced strong monoidal functors and
*invertible* monoidal natural transformations - this is a natural
choice, as the 2-cells of TortMon are invertible because of the
presence of duals - then all seem to work well (and Ross agreed in his
reply to our message).

In practice, as far as we can see, this seems to be a relatively
harmless error, as most uses of the Int-construction in the literature
do not depend on the details on 2-cells (they often do not mention
2-cells at all). However, there are some papers explicitly mentioning
2-cells and thus inheriting the incorrect statement from the JSV
paper. (Unfortunately, it is the case for a paper by one [Hasegawa] of
us ...)


Best,

Masahito Hasegawa

In The Reasoner 2:12 (December 2008), freely downloadable as

http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol2/TheReasoner-2(12).pdf

from

http://www.thereasoner.org/

editor David Corfield writes about n-categories, giving an impressively
accessible short overview of the concept and then interviewing Tom
Leinster about his experience with n-categories.

The interview is followed by an article on the Paradox of Omnipotence by
Alex Blum, which addresses the frustration any omnipotent being must
surely experience at being unable to create a stone that she cannot
lift.  (Imagine the applications, such as blocking the fridge door when
on a diet: one paradox helping another.)  Many of us in moments of
temporary perceived omnipotence have experienced this accompanying sense
of impotence, which can occur so frequently in life that one learns to
suppress it subliminally in microseconds, becoming completely
unconscious of it at an early age (but not without much screaming before
then).

Properly understood, this so-called Paradox of Omnipotence is, as often
happens, really a principle, the Principle of Omniimpotence.
Paradoxical origins tend to potentize principles to a remarkable degree,
with potencies upwards of 200C (the fourth power of a googol).  As a
case in point the omniimpotence principle forms the basis of a useful
diagnostic.  Using all available tools, how would you go about creating
a stone you cannot lift?  If it seems impossible you may be suffering
from omnipotence.

The principle is modeled at a very elementary level by 0-1 matrices,
which cannot simultaneously contain a row of all 1's and a column of all
0's.  This is the zeroary case of a more general interference or
"uncertainty principle," the binary case of which is that any proper
meet in the rows of such a matrix precludes a proper join in the
columns.  (For this purpose a meet or join is held to be *proper* when
it is neither of its arguments.)  From this it follows that if a matrix
represents a semilattice by virtue of its rows having all meets then its
columns cannot have any proper join.

This and more can be found at

   http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/coimbra.pdf

as the dry edition of the notes from the course on Chu spaces I gave at
the School on Category Theory and Applications held at the University of
Coimbra in 1999.  (The wet edition, under the slogan "All wet all the
time," would have included the above wisdom on omniimpotence but wiser
heads prevailed, both mine.)

It is not immediately obvious to the untrained eye that there should be
any connection between the omnipotence of god and category theory.  It
should therefore be of some interest to both category theorists and
theologians that a more formal connection could exist beyond this mere
juxtaposition of articles in The Reasoner.

What is missing from Vaughan's account is the "Principle of Asymptotic
Omnipotence".  Of course the supreme being can create a stone it cannot
lift.  But being omnipotent it can grow its strength to the point where it
can now lift it.  Omnipotence allows it to create a more massive stone
that it currently could not lift.  But then....  It makes no more sense to
ask what happens in the limit than it does to ask which way the fly was
flying when it was crushed between the two locomotives.

What does "when it was crushed" mean?  Assuming an infinitely small fly,
i.e. a point, and modeling locomotives as line segments (since they're
much bigger than flies), if the locomotives are open at the front (the
better to absorb the shock of hitting a cow) then "when it was crushed"
cannot be when the frontiers of the locomotives met since there was room
for the fly then.  But at every other candidate for "when it was
crushed" we can ask in which direction it was flying.

The argument looks fine with at least one locomotive closed (cows be
damned).  With exactly one the fly is crushed before the locomotives
collide, while if both are closed the fly is crushed when they collide.
  In either case you're right.

Not that there's been much warring with set theory, foundations of
mathematics, or universal algebra lately on this list, but it occurs to
me that what I wrote a couple of days ago at

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sokal_Affair#Analogy_with_religion

namely how I view the Sokal Affair, might be equally applicable to such
wars.

Wars can result from differences of opinion. e.g. ownership of
territory, interpretations, cardinality of the set of Gods (I hold that
it is a square, hence not a prime like 2 or 3, but am open to all
arguments to the contrary), or from perceived slights (gloves thrown
down, tactless cartoons, etc.), or failing economies (starvation, etc.),
or psychopathic dictators (Hitler, Mobutu), etc.

These alternatives suggest that perhaps not a great proportion of wars
are attributable to differences of interpretation.  9/11 however seems
to me inextricably linked to problems of interpretation, in particular
how such core references as the Quran, the Bible, the Torah, etc., each
held to be *the* word of God by its disciples, are to be understood and
applied, about which there is presently great disagreement just where it
seems to matter most.

Whatever strategies turn out to reconcile these differences effectively
may be just as effectively applied to category theory, lattice theory,
universal algebra, foundations of mathematics, and whatever else ticks
off the conservative end of the mathematical spectrum.  Which presently
rather ticks me off, I consider them a bunch of dogmatic atheists.  Why
can't they be a little more agnostic?

Let's make agnosticism a legitimate belief system.

In commemoration of the founding of denotational semantics in the work =20=

of Dana Scott and Christopher Strachey, the Twenty-fifth Conference on =20=

the Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics will take place =20=

on the campus of the University of Oxford, Oxford UK from April 3 - 7, =20=

2009. MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, =20
logic, and computer science that are related to models of computation, =20=

in general, and to the semantics of programming languages, in =20
particular. The series has particularly stressed providing a forum =20
where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and =20
exchange ideas about problems of common interest. As the series also =20
strives to maintain breadth in its scope, the conference strongly =20
encourages participation by researchers in neighboring areas.

TOPICS include, but are not limited to, the following: biocomputation; =20=

concurrent and distributed computation; constructive mathematics; =20
domain theory and categorical models; formal languages; formal =20
methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; logic; probabilistic =20
systems; process calculi; programming-language theory; quantum =20
computation; security; topological models; type systems; type theory.

The INVITED SPEAKERS for MFPS XXV are

Neil Ghani, Strathclyde
Marta Kwiatkowska, Oxford
Catherine Meadows, Naval Research Lab
Michael Mislove, Tulane
Dana Scott, CMU
David Schmidt, Kansas State

In addition, there will be four SPECIAL SESSIONS:

- A Session Honoring Bob Tennent on the occasion of his 65th birthday =20=

year, which is being organized by Dan Ghica (Birmingham) and Pete =20
O'Hearn (QMW), and will begin with David Schmidt's plenary talk.

- A Session on Security will be held in conjunction with Catherine =20
Meadow's plenary talk. It is being organized by Catherine Meadows  and =20=

Scope
-----
The workshop "Methods for Modalities" (M4M) aims to bring together
researchers interested in developing algorithms, verification methods
and tools based on modal logics. Here the term "modal logics" is
conceived broadly, including temporal logic, description logic,
guarded fragments, conditional logic, temporal and hybrid logic, etc.

To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will feature
a number of invited talks by leading scientists, research
presentations aimed at highlighting new developments, and submissions
of system demonstrations.

We strongly encourage young researchers and students to submit papers,
especially for experimental and prototypical software tools which are
related to modal logics.

More information about the previous editions can be found at

                       http://m4m.loria.fr/

M4M-6 will be preceded by a two-day mini-course aimed at preparing
PhD students and other researchers for participation in the workshop.
The mini-course is associated with the FIRST research school
(http://first.dk).

Paper Submissions
------------------
Authors are invited to submit papers in the following three categories.

- Regular papers up to 15 pages, describing original research.

- System descriptions of up to 12 pages, describing new systems or
significant upgrades of existing ones.

- Presentation-only papers, describing work recently published or
submitted (no page limit). These will not be included in the
proceedings, but pre-prints or post-prints can be made available to
participants.

Submissions should be made via EasyChair at the following address:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dm4m6

Final versions of accepted papers will be published online in a volume
of Elsevier Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS).
A preliminary version of the proceedings will also be available at the
workshop.

                               GaLoP IV

      4th Workshop on Games for Logic and Programming Languages

                   (satellite event of ETAPS 2009)

                     ***   CALL FOR PAPERS   ***

                        York, United Kingdom
                           28-29 March 2009

----------------------------------------------------------------------


GaLoP is an annual international workshop on game-semantic models for
logics and programming languages and their applications. This is an
informal workshop that welcomes work in progress, overviews of more
extensive work, programmatic or position papers and tutorials as well
as contributed papers. Accordingly, we ask for submission of both short
abstracts outlining what will be presented at the workshop and longer
papers describing completed work, either published or unpublished.

The fourth GaLoP will be held in York (UK) between March 28 and 29
and will be part of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and
Practice of Software (ETAPS 2009).

Contributions are invited on all pertinent subjects.

Typical (but not exclusive) areas are:

- games and categorical semantics,
- algorithmic aspects of games,
- programming languages and full abstraction,
- semantics of logics and proof systems,
- proof search,
- program verification and model checking,
- program analysis,
- theories of concurrency.

There will be no formal proceedings. In previous years, a special issue
of the Annals of Pure and Applied Logic has been produced, and this
possibility will be pursued again this year.

Dear all,

I have the following situation and I'd like to know whether there is a name
for it, or whether someone knows examples like that. That would be helpful.

1) a locally presentable category C
2) a topological locally presentable category D
3) a left adjoint F:C-->D
4) F is faithful but not full (i.e. one-to-one on morphisms) and essentially
surjective. So F is not an equivalence of categories.

Could D be a kind of "topological closure" of C ?

Thanks in advance. pg.

6th QPL workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic

April 8-9, 2009, Oxford, UK

This event has as its goal to bring together researchers working on
mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing and
spatio-temporal causal structures, and in particular those that use logical
tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages,
semantical methods and other computer science methods for the study physical
behaviour in general. Over the past couple of years there has been a growing
activity in these foundational approaches together with a renewed interest in
the foundations of quantum theory, which complement the more mainstream
research in quantum computation. A predecessor of this event, with the same
acronym, called Quantum Programming Languages, was held in Ottawa (2003), Turku
(2004), Chicago (2005) and Oxford (2006). The first QPL under the new name
Quantum Physics and Logic was held in Reykjavik (2008); with the change of name
and a new program committee we emphasise the intended much broader scope of
this event, aiming to nourish interaction between modern computer science
logic, quantum computation and information, models of spatio-temporal
causality, and quantum foundations, which resulted in an attractive program.

The event proceeds MFPS 2009, also in Oxford, at which there will a series of
tutorials to enable MFPS participants to also attend and comprehend the QPL
talks.

Submission procedure. Prospective speakers are invited to submit a 2-5 pages
abstract which provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest and
provides sufficient detail to allows the program committee to assess the merits
of the work. Submissions of works in progress are encouraged but must be more
substantial than a research proposal. We both encourage submissions of original
research as well as research submitted elsewhere. Authors of accepted original
research contributions will be invited to submit a full paper to a special
issue of a journal yet to be decided on. Submissions should be in Postscript or
PDF format and should be sent to Bob Coecke by February 13, with as subject
line QPL Submission. Receipt of all submissions will be acknowledged by return
email. Accepted contributors will be able to publish extended versions of their
2-5 abstracts in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.

                     CALL FOR PAPERS
          Seventh International Andrei Ershov Memorial Conference
                   PERSPECTIVES OF SYSTEM INFORMATICS
           15-19 June, 2009, Novosibirsk, Akademgorodok, Russia
                     http://psi.nsc.ru/psi09/index.shtml

[AIMS AND SCOPE]

PSI is a forum for academic and industrial researchers, developers and users
working on topics relating to computer, software and information sciences.
The conference serves to bridge the gaps between different communities whose
research areas are covered by but not limited to foundations of program and
system development and analysis, programming methodology and software
engineering, and information technologies. The PSI forum provides a venue
for such communities at which common problems, methods and methodologies can be
discussed and explored. In doing so, PSI aims to support researchers in their
quest to improve the reliability, flexibility and efficiency of methods,
algorithms and tools for developing computer, software and information systems.
The first six conferences were held in 1991, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2006,
respectively, and proved to be significant international events.

The PSI 2009 Conference is dedicated to the memory of a prominent scientist
academician A.P. Ershov and to a significant date in the history of computer
science in the country, namely, to the 50th anniversary of the Programming
Department (http://pd.iis.nsk.su/, in Russian) founded by him. Initially, the
Department was a part of the Institute
of Mathematics and later, in 1964, it joined the newly established Computing
Center of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences. A.P. Ershov,
who was responsible for forming the Department, gathered a team of young
graduates
from the leading Soviet universities. The first significant project of
the Department was aimed at the development of ALPHA system, an optimizing
compiler for an extension of Algol 60 implemented on a Soviet computer M-20.
Later the researchers of the Department created the Algibr, Epsilon, Sigma,
and Alpha-6 programming systems for the BESM-6 computers. The list of their
achievements also includes the first Soviet time-sharing system AIST-0,
the multi-language system BETA, research projects in artificial intelligence
and parallel programming, the integrated tools for text processing and
publishing,
and many others. The scope of problems facing the Programming Department was
widening in time, its organizational structure changed and there appeared new
research directions, school informatics and mixed computation among them.
Founded in 1990, the Institute of Informatics Systems is justly considered
to be a successor of the Programming Department keeping its main research
directions and maintaining its best traditions.

My daughter (who works for the Nature Publishing Group) sent me the
following, which is worth reading for knowing the kind of journals
Elsevier publishes.  Follow the link to John Baez' blog (from which the
comments are taken):
http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/11/the_case_of_m_s_el_naschie.html
or just go directly there and save the middle man.

I assume that this journal is indexed by ISI.  Good grief, imagine that
granting agencies are taking that crock of dung seriously.

SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT OF CT2009 IN CAPE TOWN

Dear Colleagues,

Wishing you a Happy New Year, and we - the organizers of CT2009 - look
forward to seeing you in Cape Town:

Please could you confirm your attendance at the conference as soon as
possible and certainly before February 1 by answering the following
questions by email to registration@ct2009.info

1. Name, Address/Affiliation, Email Address?

(As you would like it to appear in the list of participants)

2. Arrival and Departure dates?

(There will be a reception on the evening of Sunday, June 28. The opening
and conference talks will begin at 9:00 on Monday, June 29. The conferenc=
e
will close at 13:00 on Saturday, July 4. However, we expect that Cape Tow=
n
with all its attractions will entice many participants to prolong their s=
tay
by either arriving early or staying on after the conference. In particula=
r,
depending on the weather, we plan to organize excursions on Table Mountai=
n
and/or Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope on Saturday, July 4, and on Sunda=
y,
July 5. And any additional information about your plans and wishes would =
be
helpful)

3. Would you like to give a talk?

(If yes, please submit your abstract before April 15. If you are familiar
with TeX please submit your abstract in the following form:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\def\references#1{\vspace*{5mm}\noindent{\sc References}\list
{[\arabic{enumi}]}{\settowidth\labelwidth{[#1]}\leftmargin\labelwidth
\advance\leftmargin\labelsep
\usecounter{enumi}}
\def\newblock{\hskip .11em plus .33em minus .07em}
\sloppy\clubpenalty4000\widowpenalty4000
\sfcode`\.=3D1000\relax}

\medskip Abstract

\begin{references}{99}
\bibitem{1} Reference 1
\bibitem{2} Reference 2

\end{references}

\bigskip\bigskip\noindent{\it Address/Affiliation\\ Email}
\end{document}

We hope that the selection process will end up with all submitted abstrac=
ts
accepted with enough time for everyone to give either a 30 min or a 15 mi=
n
talk. Accordingly, there will be up to three parallel sessions.)

4. Would you like to stay at a residence on campus?

(The preferred residence is the recently built Graca Machel Hall, normall=
y
used as a residence for female students. It has "clusters" of rooms: each
such cluster consists of two double rooms, four single rooms, shared
bathroom, and one or two shared toilets. The price per day per person sho=
uld
be 181 Rands (at today's exchange rate this is less than 14 Euros) + 37
Rands (less than 3 Euros) for breakfast. Walking from Graca Machel Hall t=
o
the conference venue will take about 15 minutes but there will also be a
shuttle bus. Our lunches will be organized at the University Club, but ot=
her
meals can be organized at Graca Machel Hall. A hotel would be more
comfortable of course, and Internet will show you infinitely many hotels =
and
small guest houses in Cape Town with infinite (but not below 500 Rands)
range of prices. The only problems with a hotel are: (a) higher prices; (=
b)
non-walking distances from the conference venue; (c) public transport is =
not
easily convenient. Those of you who prefer a hotel and do not intend to r=
ent
a car, might prefer to stay near the Waterfront (see
http://www.waterfront.co.za ), or near the city centre. The city centre i=
s
about 15 minutes by car from the University. If you choose to do this the=
n
further information on transport will be forthcoming)

5. Number of accompanying persons?

(And small children among them?)

The Conference Fee does not have to be paid by February, but it is:

Regular: 2250 Rands by April 15, or 3000 Rands after April 15;
Student: 1500 Rands by April 15, or 2000 Rands after April 15;
Accompanying person (if it is not a small child): 1200 Rands by April 15,=
 or
1600 Rands after April 15

The conference fee includes the cost of the Reception, Lunches, Conferenc=
e
Dinner, and Wednesday Excursion.

The payment details are

More automation, more technological complexity,
more resources consumed. Less substance.
Ie. decreasing efficiency in human endeavour.

A trend throughout the industrialized world
since about 1950 and so sign of the trend changing.
