Agreed.  Per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BOLD I replaced the
offending article with something aiming for a middle ground and
shamelessly stealing some of your references (thanks!).  See

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_object&diff=242209011&oldid=242199687

for the previous version.

It might also be worth mentioning coalgebras, and perhaps more
importantly dually defined structures such as locales which are
understood better in terms of the morphisms from them to a cogenerator
rather than those to them from a generator, i.e. dual elements rather
than elements.  Also toposes as a more general codomain of the forgetful
functor than the particular topos Set.

Thanks for pointing out this article---Wikipedia is full of problem
articles like this and finding them and getting them into shape is an
ongoing project.

Just a last minute note for those planning to attend Octoberfest this
weekend (4,5 Oct):

There will be a $20 registration fee - please bring exact change if
possible (we'll take US$ if you haven't managed to convert to the
proper currency).  Students won't be charged registration.

The talks are to be held in room FGB040 of the Faubourg building of
Concordia University, near the corner of Pierce and Ste-Catherine.
(See the maps on the website.)

The first talk is at 9:14, but coffee will be available before.
(We'll have coffee at the site of the talks, but the area in and
around the Faubourg building is crawling with coffee shops, should you
develop cravings.)

Please check the website for all further details (schedule and
abstracts of talks, maps of the area, weather, anticipated
participants, accomodation(!), etc).

   http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/octoberfest08.html

If you plan to attend and haven't already emailed me your intentions,
please let me know asap (thanks).  I am assuming most participants are
planning to attend the lunch at a local Indian buffet - let me know
your plans if that is not true in your case, please asap.

See you Saturday,

                                PhD Position
                                         in
Operational and Categorical Approaches to Parametricity

       Department of Computer and Information Sciences
             University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland


Applications are invited for one PhD position within the newly-formed
Mathematically Structured Programming group at the University of
Strathclyde. The group comprises Prof. Neil Ghani, Dr. Patricia Johann,
and Dr. Conor McBride. The funded PhD project centers around operational
and categorical approaches to relational parametricity, which serves as
the basis for deriving both structured tools for programming with, and
effective techniques for reasoning about, functional programs, solely fro=
m
their (polymorphic) types. The project aims to develop the theoretical
foundations of parametricity for languages supporting advanced datatypes
--- such as nested types, GADTs, and their mixed-variance versions --- as
well as to apply these foundations to program transformations and other
applications. The project is under the direction of Patricia Johann.

The successful applicant will have a first-class BSc or an MSc with
distinction in Mathematics or Computing Science or a related
subject with a strong Mathematics or Computing Science component.
Ideally, they will also have a strong, documented interest in doing
research. Strong mathematical background and problem-solving
skills are essential; good programming skills are a plus. Prior
knowledge in the areas of operational semantics, category theory,
and/or parametricity is an advantage, but is not required.

The PhD position is for 3 years; the start date is negotiable. The
position is a fully-funded post for a home (i.e., UK) or EU student, and
includes both coverage of fees and an EPSRC-level stipend for each of the
three years.

More information about the department is available at

        http://www.strath.ac.uk/cis

The University of Strathclyde (http://www.strath.ac.uk) is located in the
heart of Glasgow, which Lonely Planet Travel Guides hail as "one of
Britain's largest, liveliest and most interesting cities" (see
http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/scotland/glasgow/). Southern
Scotland provides a particularly stimulating environment for researchers
in theoretical computer science, with active groups in this area at
Heriot-Watt University, the University of Edinburgh, the University of
Glasgow, the University of St. Andrews, and the University of Strathclyde=
.

Requests for further information and other informal enquiries can be sent
to:

        Patricia Johann
        patricia@cis.strath.ac.uk

Students interested in joining the group to work on other topics should
contact Prof. Ghani at Neil.Ghani at ng@cis.strath.ac.uk, since further
positions are expected soon.

Those interested in the position are asked to send e-mail to the address
given above. Full Details of the application process are available upon
request, but an application will include:

 1. A cover letter stating the applicant's specific interest in the
      project.

  2. A full curriculum vitae, including an abstract of the applicant's
       graduate thesis and the name of their supervisor.

  3. Letters of recommendation or references from at least two
       scientific staff members. (Letters of recommendation should either
       be included along with the application, or should arrive
       separately promptly.)

   4. A completed application for postgraduate study at the University
       of Strathclyde.

Applications, forms for letters of recommendation, and instructions are
available at

        http://www.strath.ac.uk/prospectus/postgraduateapplications/

Applications will be considered until the position is filled, but those
received earlier rather than later will have priority.

*********************************************************

FM2009 is the  sixteenth in a series  of symposia  of the
Formal Methods Europe  association,   and the second  one
that  is organized as  a world congress. Ten  years after
FM'99,  the  1st  World Congress,  the   formal   methods
communities from all over the world  will once again have
an  opportunity  to  meet.   FM 2009   will  be  both  an
opportunity to  celebrate, and an  opportunity to join in
when enthusiastic   researchers and practitioners  from a
diversity  of backgrounds and   schools come together  to
discuss their ideas and experiences.

The Programme Committee  of  FM2009 comprises 83  members
representing 46 countries.   For the technical symposium,
papers  on    every aspect   of   the   *development  and
application of formal methods for  the improvement of the
current practice on system developments*  are invited for
submission.  Of particular interest  are papers on  tools
and  *industrial applications* : there will  be a special
track devoted to this topic.

Many  have already joined  the celebrations. Springer has
offered a prize  for  The  Best  Paper;  this Award  will
include  free electronic access to the  Formal Aspects of
Computing journal for one year,  and a choice of Springer
books  up  to a  value  of EUR 250.00.  The  authors of a
selection  of  the accepted  papers  will  be  invited to
submit extended versions  of their papers  to anniversary
special issues of  reputable journals.  And there will be
more: watch this space.

It will  be possible to participate  in other ways: there
will be opportunities to propose tutorials and workshops,
a  Doctoral   Symposium,    a  tools    exhibition,   and
more. Complete and up to date information can be found at
http://www.win.tue.nl/fm2009/. FM2009 is also part of the
1st  FMweek  (Formal  Methods week),   which  will  bring
together a  variety  of events   in  the area,  including
TESTCOM/FATES  (Conference  on Testing  of  Communicating
Systems  and  Workshop on Formal Approaches to Testing of
Software),  FMICS (Formal Methods for Industrial Critical
Systems), and the REFINE Workshop.

There will be something for everybody.  So, put the dates
in your diary:

Submission deadline         4 May, 2009
Notification of acceptance  6 July, 2009
Final version               10 August, 2009

This is somewhat offtopic [moderator, feel free to delete the message],
but things best done by machines should be done by machines. At
http://validator.w3.org/checklink you enter a URL and it tells you about
broken links.

There's more stuff like that at http://validator.w3.org/ such as making
sure your HTML has all its tags slashed.

There were some interesting postings a little while back on k-spaces.
In connection to that I have been meaning to publicize the fact that I
scanned Brian Day's Masters thesis awhile back. I put a link on his
publication page: it is

http://www.math.mq.edu.au/~street/DayMasters.pdf

I hope to scan his PhD thesis and other hard-to-get items soon.

Hello

I'm trying to study the Category of Matrices but I found almost nothing. Do
you know where
I can find information about them?

More specifically can we consider the tensor product as the product
bi-functor?

I think you may have more success searching for information about the
category Vect_K of vector spaces and K-linear transformations between
them, where K is the field of interest (usually the reals K=R or the
complex numbers K=C).

In Set, the cartesian product is different from the coproduct, and the
product satisfies
   hom(A x B, C) is isomorphic to hom(A, C^B)
making Set into a cartesian closed category, a special kind of
symmetric monoidal closed category; but this is not true in Vect.

The product and coproduct are the same in Vect, namely the "direct
sum", while the tensor product is what makes Vect into a symmetric
monoidal closed category:
   hom(A tensor B, C) = hom(A, B -o C)
where -o is linear implication.  Vect also happens to be a compact
closed category, which means that B -o C is isomorphic to B* tensor C.

Do you mean matrices as the objects of this category?
or as its morphisms (in which case, what objects do you see?)?
Might make a difference in the references you get pointed to.

Sorry, that should read "is isomorphic to", not strict equality.

Dear all,

I need some references for this problem. Suppose we have a locally
presentable category C axiomatized by a limits theory T, so C=Mod(T).
Let us forget some relational symbols in T and all axioms containing these
relational symbols. One obtains a theory T'. There is a forgetful functor
Mod(T) --> Mod(T'). Does this functor have always a right adjoint ? If not,
what conditions must we add ?

Thanks in advance. pg.

On any additive category A you can define a category of matrices Mat(A).
 The objects of Mat(A) are n-tuples A_*= (A_1, ...,A_n) for all n >= 1, of
objects of A. A morphism a_**: A_* \to B_* consists of arrays of morphisms
a_{ij}: A_i \to B_j (or is it the other way round? I leave you to look for
the conventions). If you get the conventions right, then composition in
Mat(A) is just matrix composition.

The nice point about this is that Mat(A) is again an additive category, so
the process can be iterated.  Actually only semi-additive is needed (matrix
composition does not use negatives.)

The above idea essentially yields  partitioned matrices (see old books on
matrices).

This passage A \mapsto Mat(A) ought to be available on computer software!

I expect the above is in a reference somewhere!

Once upon a time I handwrote some incomplete notes on "skeletal"
representation theory
which started out looking at Mat (a skeleton of Vect) as a monoidal
category with direct sums
(the tensor product is Kronecker product of matrices). I tried to
strictify as much as possible
all the associativity, distributivity, . . constraints. I typed it at
some point. The pdf file has some
funny things (notably copyright signs!) in it but it has been on the
web (linked from my
Publications page) for quite awhile. Maybe it is the kind of thing
Hugo has in mind. But
remember, it is sort of "in progress"; no jokes please about "droup"
which is meant as
short for "dual group"!

The 20th International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications
(RTA 2009) is organized as part of the Federated Conference on Rewriting,
Deduction, and Programming (RDP 2009), together with the International
Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA 2009), and
several workshops. The conference will be preceded by the 4th
International School on Rewriting (ISR).

Bras_lia, the federal capital of Brazil, is listed as a World Heritage
Site by UNESCO.  RDP 2009 will be held at Universidade de Bras_lia,
one of the largest and one of the most prestigious universities in
Brazil, on a campus built by highly acclaimed architect Oscar
Niemeyer. Bras_lia is easily reached by plane; air fares are moderate
at that time of the year.

(to be indicated at submission):

1. Regular Research Papers: describing new results; they will be judged
   on correctness and significance.

2. Papers describing the experience of applying rewriting techniques in
   other areas; they will be judged on relevance and comparison with
   other approaches.

3. Problem sets that provide realistic and interesting challenges in
   the field of rewriting.

4. System descriptions; they should contain a link to a working system
   and will be judged on usefulness and design.

All submissions will be judged on originality and quality of
presentation. Submissions in the first three categories can be up to
15 proceedings pages long, system descriptions up to 10 proceedings
pages. Additional material, for instance proof details, may be given
in an appendix which is not subject to the limitation of
pages. However, submissions must be self-contained within the

Dear all,=20

Thank you for all answers. But they do not give what I want. I am looking f=
or=20
a -R-I-G-H-T- adjoint, and by comparing the example I have and the limit=20
theory axiomatizing the category of small categories (for which the forgetf=
ul=20
functor Mod(T)-->Set does not have any right adjoint since it is not=20
colimit-preserving), i found (maybe) the following sufficient condition:=20

If T is a limit theory without equality symbol before the implication signs=
,=20
then any forgetful functor Mod(T) --> Mod(T') has a right adjoint.

Indeed, all sentences of T are of the form (Ax)(F(x)=3D>((E!y)G(x,y)) where=
 F(x)=20
and G(x,y) are conjunctions of atomic formulas. By hypothesis, F does not=20
contain the symbol =3D. So the forgetful functor Mod(T) --> Mod(T') is coli=
mit=20
preserving. Since Mod(T) is locally presentable, it is cocomplete,=20
cowellpowered and has a strong generator. So by SAFT, the forgetful functor=
=20
Mod(T) --> Mod(T') has a right adjoint.

Does it sound good ?

Thanks in advance. pg.

I am surprised that nobody suggested to Hugo
to have a look at modules/profunctors.

Right adjoints to algebraic functors are very interesting.
Witt vectors and lambda-rings are key words. See

Hi, Hugo,

Given the spec "as its morphisms," there are at least three perspectives.=


1) (narrowest) you're focussed on some field F and on the very =

particular vector spaces over F that are of form F^n for natural =

numbers n, along with the matrices that "are" the F-linear
transformations among them. Any linear algebra text should help.

2) (intermediate) you're focussed on some semiring R (equipped with
a multiplication and an addition, each associative and unital, =

and together satisfying a distributive law) and are after the
category with objects the natural numbers and maps from k to n
the n by k matrices with coefficients from R.

This can be construed also as the full subcategory of R-semimodules
whose objects are the finitely generated free ones, which is the
Lawvere-style "algebraic theory" of R-semimodules.

"Functorial semantics" (google it?) can offer broad general insights.

Perspective 1) arises from the special case of 2) with R =3D F.

3) (broadest) what Ronnie Brown pointed out -- from almost any =

category A one can form a new category whose objects are the finite
sequences of objects of A and whose maps, from say A1 ... An to
B1 ... Bk are the n by k matrices whose various ij'th entries are
A-morphisms from Ai to Bj [or, if you prefer, the exact opposite].

Some Russians in the '60s or '70s in the Kurosh school (i.e. [students =

of ...]* students of Kurosh) exploited that construction to explain =

how to embed a less-than-additive category in an additive one. The names =

Kurosh, Lifshutz and Shulgeifer come to mind (perhaps inappropriately?),
but the publications I'd like to cite for you, or my copies of them,
anyway, are in storage, and inaccessible to me at the moment, sorry.

Perspective 2) arises from the special case of 3) with =

A =3D the one-object pre-additive category R.

May these pointers help get you started. Cheers,

-- Fred

*ALICS* - Applications of Logic in Computer Security
LPAR 2008 workshop, November 22, Doha, Qatar
-----------------------------------------------------

    EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE - 24th October

-----------------------------------------------------

Organizer: Catherine Meadows, NRL
Submission deadline: October 24, 2008
Submission: 1-5 pages abstract
Web: http://chacs.nrl.navy.mil/projects/ALICS08


Scope:

ALICS is intended to be an informal workshop devoted to the applications
of logic in computer security. This workshop is intended for
presentation and discussion of work in progress and the discussion of
emerging and foundational ideas. We are interested in all aspects of the
application of logic to computer security. Applications of interest
include security policy, access control, security protocols, information
flow, but we are also interested in new and as yet untried applications
of logic to different areas of computer security. We are also interested
in discussion papers that raise fundamental questions and/or suggest new
lines of research in this area.  Work that has already appeared or is
under consideration by other venues is welcome. No formal proceedings is
planned, but accepted abstracts will be posted online.

The forgetful functor from groups to monoids has a right adjoint=20
which associates to a monoid its group of invertible elements.=20

I am looking for a general explanation of this observation.
It should a consequence of a general result on
forgetful functors of a certain kind.

Greetings,

Sorry to spam everyone in the list but I was curious whether the ideas
for a wiki-style project on exposition of mathematics (which were
previously discussed on this mailing list) were going somewhere or being
implemented.
The reason I am asking is that I am curious/interested in such a project
and I was left not understanding what came out of the previous discussion
on this list since it just seemed to stop rather abruptly.

Thank you,
Ricardo

A Young Research Fellow Position at IMT, Lucca, Italy
Computer Science and Engineering

Deadline December 1st, 2008

IMT Institute for Advanced Studies invites strong candidates active
on networking and software systems for global computing, including
web data mining and mobile systems, with applications e.g. to service
oriented computing, economics and embedded systems, to apply for a
Faculty Position at the Assistant Professor or Post-Doctoral Fellow
level. Preference will be given to candidates combining in their
research fundamental and application oriented aspects.

Preference will be given to candidates with a Ph.D. degree (or close
to completion), or candidates with experience in formal instruction
at the graduate-level.

The selected candidate will be appointed for a term of up to three
years. The contract may be renewed once for additional 3 years (i.e.
six year in total). The remuneration package is competitive at the
international level and include generous research funds. Additional
benefits may be negotiated with selected applicants.

Assistant Professors are senior positions and differ from
Post-doctoral Fellows on the basis of experience, scientific
curriculum and remuneration.

Successful candidates for either type of position will work closely
with other young researchers, senior researchers and graduate
students, and will have a limited teaching load in the school's
graduate program (e.g. one class per year).

Application Procedure
Applicants are required to fill out the online application form and
upload a complete curriculum vitae and one research paper (published
or working paper) as PDF files. Please note that you are also
required to upload a signed copy of your Identity Document.

Online applications only at:
http://www.imtlucca.it/faculty/positions/young-research-fellows_positions/call_for_applications_in_computer_sciences_and_engineering.php

Candidates are required to indicate if they intend to apply only for
one of the two positions offered (Assistant Professor and
Post-doctoral Fellow) or for both. Please note that if you apply for
both positions you do not need to submit two applications.

In addition, at least two letters of reference must be sent as e-mail
attachments (preferably in PDF format) to: yrf.opening@imtlucca.it or
by mail to the following address:

I'd like to announce a selection of Web-based category theory
demonstrations that I've put up at
http://www.j-paine.org/cgi-bin/webcats/webcats.php . The page contains a
number of buttons such as "generate and demonstrate an equaliser" and
"generate and demonstrate a limit": clicking on one will generate
an example of the construct in the category of finite sets, and display it
as a listing of its objects and arrows, and as a diagram. For limits and
colimits, the demos generate a small random graph, convert it to a
diagram, then compute and display its limit or colimit.

Comments would be very welcome. The demos are a bit of an experiment: I
had some categorical algorithms lying around from other work, and thought
it would be interesting to connect them to the Web.

Thanks to the people who commented on my demonstrations. Unfortunately,
I've had to disable these for the moment, because something is hammering
the site and overwhelming my file quota with the number of image files
created. (I'm on a commercial ISP, so resources are a bit tight.) I
suspect that since I released the links, they've been grabbed by robots,
so I need to look into that, and also be quicker at deleting old files.
I'll post when that's sorted out.

Dear Category Theorists,

	Does anyone know whether any work has been done on sketches where
all diagrams are required to commute - i.e. the models are functors from a
poset to the given category.
	I'm particularly interested in the case where the sketch is in
fact a lattice, and where we require every

avb--------------a
 |               |
 |               |
 |               |
 b--------------a^b

should be sent to a pullback.

Thanks for any pointers you can give.

Toby
