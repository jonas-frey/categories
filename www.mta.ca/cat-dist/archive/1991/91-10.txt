From: Robert Seely  <rags@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

The article

   Weakly distributive categories

   by J.R.B. Cockett and R.A.G. Seely

(as submitted to the Durham Symposium Proceedings)

is available by anonymous ftp from triples.math.mcgill.ca.

The files needed for this paper are in the ftp directory
pub/rags/wk_dist_cat/
Full instructions are in the file pub/rags/wk_dist_cat.README :
a brief summary is given now:

When in the directory pub/rags/wk_dist_cat/, you have a choice:
Either take the .dvi (or .ps) file wdcat.dvi (or wdcat.ps)
or else take all the .tex and .sty files in this directory (by mget *.tex,
get sprite.sty) and tex it yourself.

You'll need a file for each section (sorry - but for dual authorship
that seemed easier, and I've not got 'round to joining them up!),
one for the overall structure, a macro file, two files to produce a
par symbol, (one a .sty file), and F. Borceux' diagram macro file.

DON'T FORGET to set the ftp to binary (and also faster if you don't ask for
a prompt at each file) for transferring .dvi or .ps files.

%ftp triples.math.mcgill.ca

login as user anonymous with your email address as password

ftp>cd pub/rags
ftp>dir

Then do one of these:

ftp>prompt
ftp>mget *.tex
ftp>get sprite.sty

or:

ftp>bin
ftp>get wdcat.dvi     (or   ftp>get wdcat.ps    )

ftp>quit

That should do.

Can anyone point me to a reference on the categorical properties of
the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators, or on the
functorial properties of the construction of L^2 spaces from measure
spaces?

	In particular I'd like to know a characterization of those maps
with respect to which L^2 is functorial.

	It would also be helpful to know the completeness properties of
the category of Hilbert spaces.

		    Categories, Types, and Structures
	    An Introduction to Category Theory for the Working
			    Computer Scientist
				    by
		    Andrea Asperti and Giuseppe Longo

Categories, Types, and Structures provides a self-contained introduction
to general category theory and explains the mathematical structures that
have been the foundation of programming language design for the past two
decades. The authors observe that the language of categories could provide
a powerful means for standardizing methods and language, and they offer
examples including recursion theory, the early dialect of LISP, Edingurg
ML, and current work in polymorphism and modularity.

In Part 1, the book familiarizes readers with categorical concepts through
examples based on elementary mathematical notions such as monoids, groups,
and topological spaces, as well as elementary notions from programming
language semantics such as partial orders and categories of domains in
denotational semantics.

Part 2 pursues the more complex mathematical semantics of data types and
programs as objects and morphisms of categories.  In particular, the
semantics of type-free lambda calculus and of its more recent higher-order
versions is closely discussed.  The basis for a theory of internal
category theory is also developed as a tool for the categorical
understanding of polymorphism in functional programming.

Andrea Asperti is Charg de Recherche at INRIA-Rocquencourt.
Giuseppe Longo is Directeur de Recherches CNRS at the Departement
de Mathematiques et Informatique, Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris,
and is former Professor Computer Science at the University of Pisa.
The first draft of the book was written while Longo was teaching a
course on the topic at Carnegie Mellon University, in 1987/88, and
Asperti was visiting there as a graduate student.

%Subject: Query on homotopy commutative diagrams

%Dear experts,

% I recently reproved the following lemma about homotopy commutative 
% diagrams after Peter May found an error in the proof I published 10 years ago.
%(The following is written in LateX.)
\documentstyle{article}
\begin{document}
Suppose are given a collection of pointed
CW--complexes (or CW--spectra) $X_{i, j}$ for $i, j \in \ints$, maps
$f:X_{i, j} \to X_{i + 1, j}$ and $g:X_{i, j} \to X_{i, j + 1}$ (we can safely
omit the subscripts on $f$ and $g$) so that the diagram
$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
X_{i, j}
       &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}
               &X_{i + 1, j}
                       &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}
                               & \cdots\\
{}\sp{g}\downarrow
       &
               &\downarrow {}\sp{g}\\
X_{i, j + 1}
       &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}
               &X_{i + 1, j + 1}
                       &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}
                               & \cdots\\
{}\sp{g}\downarrow
       &
               &\downarrow {}\sp{g}\\
\vdots
       &
               &\vdots
\end{array}
$$
commutes up to homotopy, and for each $(i, j)$ we are given a
homotopy
$$
X_{i, j} \times I \stackrel{h}{\longrightarrow}
X_{i + 1, j + 1}
$$
with $h(x, 0) = fg(x)$ and $h(x, 1) = gf(x)$.

Then this diagram is homotopy equivalent to a {\em strictly}
commutative diagram with spaces $X'_{i, j}$ and maps $f'$ and $g'$,  each of
which is a cofibration (i.e.,  an inclusion).  The construction of this new
diagram depends on the given homotopies $h$.  For each $(i, j)$ there are
homotopy equivalences
$$
\alpha:X_{i, j} \to X'_{i, j}        \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
\beta:X'_{i, j} \to X_{i, j}
$$
with $f'\alpha$ homotopic to $\alpha f$, $g'\alpha$ homotopic to
$\alpha g$, $\beta f'$
homotopic to $f\beta$, and $\beta g'$ homotopic to $g\beta$.
\end{document}
My first question is, has anyone heard of this before?  
The proof is elementary and should have been done thirty years ago.

I would like to generalize this result to $n$--dimensional diagrams 
equipped with suitable higher homotopies.  The proof I have in 
mind is still elementary in spirit but could involve 
some tricky combinatorics that I would like to avoid.  In 
particular it reqires a tessellation of $n$--space with certain properties.  
I suspect that all of the relevant higher homotopies have been written 
down somewhere but I do not know where.  I also suspect that 
someone has developed some machinery that will enable one 
to prove this quickly.

Any suggestions?

Thanks for your help.

Seems to me it is a case of rectification but I defer to the experts for
the precise details/reference, especially with regard to the topology involved.

Subj:	RE: homotopy theory, but really ...
Date: Wed, 23 Oct 91 8:53 GMT
From: MAS013@vaxa.bangor.ac.uk

On the question of rectification, see some papers by Jean-Marc Cordier
and myself. A good start is J.P.A.A. 67 (1990) 111-124, and then follow up
references. The basic input is the theory of homotopy coherence as developed
by R.Vogt, Math Z. 134 (1973)11-52. The rectification is a very special
case of some of the constructions in his work with Boardman, [SLNM 347,1973].
Cordier{Cahiers, 23 (1982) 93-112] translated this to a simplicial context,
so rectification becomes a coherent Kan extension in our paper[Math.Proc.
Camb.Phil.Soc. 100(1986)65-90]. We have almost finished a sequel"doing"
homotopy coherent category theory using a theory of coherent ends. The
combinatorics are quite fun!!!
With this theory, I think that it is relatively easy to answer Doug Ravenels
question.

In retrospect, your associahedra are very closely related to my orientals:
something like the geometric realization of their nerve. When writing about
orientals, I had categorical coherence and cohomology more clearly in mind
than homotopy (except for the vague analogy -which I have been trying to make
precise since 1968- that 2-cells are like homotopies).

In order to generate an omega-category, one needs to divide the boundary of
each cell decisively into two parts. There is a bit of choice about how
this is done with your construction, isn't there? I seem to remember that
you have more cells than the orientals. Also, do you want inverses to your
cells as exist at the homotopy level?

Regards,
Ross

From: James Stasheff <jds@charlie.math.unc.edu>

two good questions
the division into two pieces is relevant to trying to change the
geometry into non-abelian cohomology - the boundary as a difference
have been looking at some related questions that come up in
quasi-bialgebras

at the homotopy level, I always have inverses (up to
homotopy) - just run the parameter backwards
but work in quasi-bialgebra AND in string field theory both suggest
imposing stricter inverses
e.g. take the category of paths in a space X with endpoint joining
of paths as compositions
mod out by the relation fg = Id_x and gf=I_y where g is a path from
x to y and f is its parameter reverse
