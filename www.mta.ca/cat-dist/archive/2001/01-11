Dear Saul,

I can envisage at least two distinct ways of computing with categories.
One is for category theorists to use computers to do their calculation
or perhaps even provide formal proofs of theorems. The second is to use
ideas from category theory as a guide to the design of programming
languages. For example, the use of monads to control computational
effects. 

One strand of the latter approach is to incorporate into programming the
use of functors, and their associated operations, like mapping. This
began with Charity (Cockett and Fukushima). Since then functors have
been represented in Haskell using a type class, have appeared in the
type system in Functorial ML (Belle, Jay and Moggi) and most recently 
the constructor calculus (Jay).  In the latter all data structures,
including those defined by users, can be represented using a fixed,
finite set of constructors, derived from basic categorical concepts.
Then polymorphic functions for mapping, folding etc. can be defined by
pattern-matching over the basic constructors. Details can be found in my
recent paper at Typed Lambda-Calculi and their Applications, or in the
technical report at
http://www-staff.it.uts.edu.au/~cbj/Publications/constructors.ps. These
ideas have been realised in a new language FISh2 currently under
development. 

Yours,
Barry Jay

Hi Barry & Phil,

      Thanks for the answers.  I knew about Charity and ML but not Fish 
& Fish2 or
CAML (the word "category" does not appear on either the Fish or CAML
web pages!).

I didn't explain what I'm interested in very well, but I don't think that
it's either of your distinct ways above.  I'm not thinking about automatic
diagram chasing or proof assistance or something like that.  I'm also
don't have in mind regular functional languages that are defined using
category theory (although I can see that these things are quite neat).

     Maybe it's best if I put it this way.  There are lots of people
around doing mathematical software in, say, C++, Maple or Mathematica or
home grown systems.

 These systems are fine for, say, defining integers or functions or vector
spaces or groups, but are essentially hopeless for categories, functors,
adjoints, etc.  Even the most basic constructions of category theory are
very awkward to deal with at best.  This, it seems to me, is a crippling
limitation of these systems compared to what would be possible if you
could only define categories and functors with the ease that you define
matrices and functions.

      I guess I'm asking for a language where you could mix "regular math
stuff" and category theory with ease as is done in mathematics on paper.  
A language or system suitable for writing large general purpose math
libraries, say, that use category theory concepts at least as the high
level organizing principles.  Wouldn't that be nice?

      This wasn't a problem before, but now that I know some category
theory, it pains me greatly!  I also find it strange that this isn't a big
priority, in, for instance, the CS community.

I'll have a look at your technical report too.

Cheers,

Saul Youssef

I don't know if this is the correct site for this question.  If not, if
anyone has info on general math bulletin boards, it would be greatly
appreciated.

thanks!!

I understand a relation is a set, and you can have an ordered pair, ie
(V,E), where E is a binary relation on V. This of course is a graph. 

Functions are just a type of relation, with the added specifics that each
element of a set S must correspond with another unique element in S or say
another set T. Hence a function is also a set of these pairings, ie f:S->T. 

What are operations, though? Are these sets as well? Can they be described
as a set. If I look closely at the definition, an operation C on sets,
C:A->A is just like a function. Is an operation just a specialized function
with the added requirement that the mapping be from set A to itself, ie
closure? If this is the case, then, are all operations functions, and all
functions relations?? Finally, does the general definition of operation
require closure on the set??

Hello Cat Community,

   I have been reading Goldblatt's book on topoi and
also a paper by Peter Johnstone on subobject
classifiers. Please "school" me .... In both places it
says that in general a subobject classifier's
"elements" are used as logic "values'. E.g. in the
topos Set, I can see that the s.c. (subobject
classifier) {0, 1} is a set of logic values that
defines a Boolean algebra. In the topos of Graph 
we also can come up with a set of logical values.
These examples of s.c. all clearly are sets or
structured sets .. hence have elements. I don't see
how in a totally general case of a topos we can say
that "elements" of it's s.c. define a set of logic
values .... after all the guiding principle of
category theory is that objects are opaque.

Thanks, Bill Halchin

In a topos (or any closed monoidal category C with unit object 1),
an "element" of an object X is a morphism from 1 to X.
Think of the functor Hom(1,.): C -> _Set_ as the "forgetful functor"
that defines the category C as sets with extra structure.
Of course, it will only be *really* valid to think of C
as sets with extra structure if this functor is faithful.
A topos C is called "well pointed" when this holds.

What are the standard references for weighted limits and colimits in
enriched categories?  I know about Borceux, volume 2, chapter 6, but
that does not go far enough. 

More precisely, I want to know how functorial the weighted colimit is in
the weight.  Given a V-natural transformation F --> F', presumably I get
some kind of map from colim_F G to colim_F' G (or the other way
around).  I would like a reference for this fact and related functoriality
facts.  

Presumably the weighted colimit is a bifunctor in the weight and the
functor one is taking the colimit of, and presumably this bifunctor has
various good properties.  Has anybody ever written these down?

Thanks in advance for any help you can give me.

I am embarrassed that I did not reply to kind and helpful messages to a
query I put on July 10 about embedability of a cartesian closed category in
a topos. The problem was that I got too many distractions (health,
holidays, family, other jobs) but really I did not explain the origin of
the question. So here goes. 

I am writing an invited article on k-spaces for an Encyclopaedia of general
topology to  be published by Elsevier, and of course k-spaces and also
sequential spaces form a cartesian closed category. I want to make a nod in
the direction of topos methods in order to be able to indicate how to deal
with spaces of  partial maps, and fibred exponential laws. There is quite a
bit of literature on these in algebraic topology but so far they do not go
the whole hog and use toposes. Again in analysis,  there is the book by
Moerdijk and Reyes, and also the later book by Kriegl and Michor `A
convenient setting for global analysis' which has the former book in its
bibliography but does not have the word topos in the index. There is a lot
of general topology work on hyperspaces, and also from a different approach
on spaces of partial maps, but one would like to know if this can all be
subsumed under topos work, or at least suggest it as a topic for
investigation. 

I realise as Peter Jonstone wrote that he has embedded the category of
sequential spaces in a topos, and I think Kock and Reyes have some work on
on embedding convenient vector spaces in a topos, but does this work for
k-spaces, or for the Kriegl and Michor situation? 

All this is not really my area but I would like to give helpful remarks in
this direction. For those interested I attach a dvi file of the current
draft and comments would be welcomed. 

Many thanks in anticipation and apologies again for not getting back on
this earlier. 

Best wishes

Ronnie

The following preprint is available on line:

Marco Grandis,
'Directed homotopy theory, I. The fundamental category'

Abstract.

   Directed Algebraic Topology is beginning to emerge from various applications.

   The basic structure we shall use for such a theory, a 'd-space', is a
topological space equipped with a family of 'directed paths', closed under some
operations. This allows for 'directed homotopies', generally non reversible,
represented by a cylinder and cocylinder functors. The existence of 'pastings'
(colimits) yields a geometric realisation of cubical sets as d-spaces, together
with homotopy constructs which will be developed in a sequel. Here, the
'fundamental category' of a d-space is introduced and a 'Seifert - van Kampen'
theorem proved; its homotopy invariance rests on 'directed homotopy' of
categories. In the process, new shapes appear, for d-spaces but also for small
categories, their elementary algebraic model.

   Applications of such tools are briefly considered or suggested, for objects
which model a directed image, or a portion of space-time, or a concurrent
process.

Greetings.  I am new to the categories list.
I would like to receive any pointers to work that has been done

`Some problems in non-abelian homotopical and homological
algebra'. This is LateX version  of a paper from a 1988 homotopy
theory conference published in 1999. It contains 35 problems or
problem areas and a few comments now on what has been solved since
then. Is it all old hat? (26 pages)

I need help with respect to the following question.
With the help of M.M. Clementino and J. Picado, I understood that an open
morphism f: X --> Y in the category of locales (dual to the category of
frames) has the property that taking inverse images (pullbacks) along
f commutes with taking closures of sublocales:  f*[cl(N)] = cl(f*[N]) for
all sublocales N of Y.
Conversely, does this property force f to be open (as it does for
topological spaces)? If not, is the answer positive when f is the
embedding of a sublocale?

I appreciate any suggestions/answers that you may have. Thanks,

Walter Tholen.

A tenure-track position in "Algebra, Logic, or related areas" at the
assistant professor level is advertised at York University in Toronto. For
details see http://www.math.yorku.ca/Hiring/t_track_math.htm .

While spreading this info here I hasten to add that I have no indication
whether the department would welcome applications from category theorists.
Being on sabbatical I would in any event have no influence whatsoever on
the selection procedure.

In his letter below, Mark Harvey asks about the functoriality of the
weighted colimit F*G where 
we are dealing with V-categories and say F: K --> V
and G: K --> A.

The matter is dealt with at length in my book ["Basic Concepts of
Enriched Category Theory", London Math Soc. Lecture Notes Series 64,
Cambridge University Press, 1982.]. (The book uses the older terminology
"indexed limit" for "weighted limit" and so on. See Chapter 3, and the
work in Chapter 4 on final and initial weights.

Perhaps a useful reference on weighted (there called indexed) limits
is Chapter 3 of Basic Concepts of Enriched Category Theory by Max Kelly,
containing your desired result and much more.
BTW, Peter Johnstone wrote a rather nice (and amusing) review of BCECT
in the Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society,
supplementing the helpful, accurate, but not very farseeing (in terms
of potential applications for ECs) BAMS review by Gray
and Linton's short antidote to Gray in MR.

there is a paper by nancy durgin, john mitchell and me, describing a
process calculus and logic for reasoning about security protocols. it
should be on my web page http://www.kestrel.edu/home/people/pavlovic/
. the process calculus induces an action category, which is very
briefly described in the paper. the point is that the categorical
structure captures the static (design-time) composition of protocols.
in a way, the category thus displays some sort of denotations of
protocols. the analysis then proceeds by attaching axiomatic semantics
to the morphisms.

Hello,

   This is a followup question to my other question
about topoi and intuistionistic logic. On page 350,
Lawvere is talking about logical operations (in
a Heyting algebra I think??). In particular I 
having trouble understanding the narrative on the
implication operation "=>" in the sense 
1) I don't understand what <alpha, beta>. (e.g.
      is alpha meant to be an 
      element: alpha:1->omega?)

2) also what alpha "subset" beta is! 


 Please help me.

Thanks and regards, Bill Halchin

The answer is no: for any locale Y, the embedding of the smallest dense
sublocale of Y has this property. Of course, if X is the smallest dense
sublocale of Y, then any sublocale of X is closed (since the frame
corresponding to X is Boolean); so this is tantamount to saying that,
given any sublocale N of Y, N and its closure have the same intersection
with X. This in turn is equivalent to the assertion that if we
have elements U and V of a frame satisfying V \leq U and
((U => 0) => 0) = U, then we also have ((U => V) => V) = U.
The verification of this is left as an exercise for the reader.

Hi,

I would very much appreciate information regarding any
papers on category theory (comprehensive reviews,
overviews=85) published in a peer-reviewed journal
during the month of November 2001. I would like to
highlight category theory as a tool for cognitive
neuroscience for possible publication in Nature
Reviews Neuroscience (NRN). NRN has announced a
Highlights competition. One of the rules is:
Highlights should be written on papers published in
any peer-reviewed scientific journal between 1
November and 1 December 2001. Selected Highlights will
be published in January 2002 issue and they give
one-year free subscription.

Thanks so much for your help.

Thanking you,
Sincerely,
Posina venkata rayudu

Have a look at Chapter 3 of Max Kelly's book ``The basic concepts

Yes, it is functorial in F, in the way that you have written above.

Once again, yes. There's quite a lot in the reference above. Kelly writes
F*G for what you have called colim_F G, and {F,G} for what you would 
presumably call lim_F G. He develops results based on the intuition that
* is a kind of tensor product, and {-,-} a kind of internal hom, and 
proves results like the associativity of * and {F*G,H}={F,{G,H}}. Of course
this sounds a bit odd, because the F and the G live in different categories,
but you can actually make sense of these things. There is even an isomorphism
F*G=G*F in the case of colimits in V itself.

There's another approach, which probably goes back to 

Street and Walters, Yoneda structures on 2-categories, J. Algebra 
50:350-379, 1978

and has been developed by Street and many others since. In this
approach you define a bicategory, often called V-Prof or V-Mod,
in which an object is a V-category, and a morphism from A to B,
often written A-|->B is a V-functor from A to [B^op,V], and a 
2-cell is a natural transformation. (This direction of the 1-cells
and 2-cells in this definition is not universally adopted.)
Then composition is given by colimit, in the sense that if f:A-|->B 
and g:B-|->C, then gf:A-|->C is defined by gf(a,c)=g(-,c)*f(a,-). 
Then associativity (up to isomorphism) of composition in this 
bicategory is the associaitivity of * referred to above. In fact 
this bicategory is closed, in the sense that composition has an adjoint, 
constructed using {-,-}.

Steve Lack.

I've let myself be tempted by the recent astonishingly low prices
for trans-Atlantic air tickets, and booked myself to Europe for
the 10 days of the North American Thanksgiving break (16-26 Nov.).
Now I wonder: any little "peripatetic"s going on that I might join?

In a bit more detail, my arrival/departure airport will be Frankfurt,
and I imagine passing (by rail) along the "circle" passing through
Frankfurt, Cologne/Aachen, Belgium (Liege/Louvain/Brussels/Antwerp),
France (Amiens/Paris/Lyon), Italy (Torino/Milano), Freiburg, Frankfurt
-- maybe "counterclockwise" as listed above, or maybe clockwise instead.

Nor any guarantee I'll actually pass through all of the places mentioned.
But if you are in or near one of them and would like to have me try to
visit, do let me know, please, before my departure 11/16/2001.

For contact during the period 17-25.11.2001 while I'm in Europe,
a GSM phone-call or SMS will reach me, if you use +1 203 606 3131,
as will e-mail to  <2036063131@voicestream.net> , which gets
retransmitted to the phone as an SMS (so: best stay under 125 char.).

Very short notice, I know -- until the tickets reached me, yesterday,
I wasn't really sure I'd be doing this, after all.

Hope to see some of you!

I have been finding some nonsymmetric closed category structures on some
important categories.  By this, I mean a monoidal category, not necessarily
symmetric, such that each functor -\square b has a right adjoint.  For
example, I found a nice such structure on the category of locally closed
topological spaces, that is, spaces such that the filter of neighborhoods of
each point has a base of closed neighborhoods.

I'm probably going to write this and some other examples up and put it online
somewhere.  Does anyone know of previous work which would be relevant?  In
Mac Lanes CWM he talks about compactly generated spaces, which I have looked
at carefully, but this is a somewhat different approach to moving beyond the
locally compact Hausdorff spaces, which of course form a cartesian closed
category.  In my example, of course, the \square operation is not the product
of topological spaces, although it has a continuous map onto it.

Dear Categorists -

I'm getting really annoyed at how the category Diff of smooth
manifolds and smooth maps isn't complete and cocomplete.  
Is there some category of "smooth spaces" that repairs these
defects?  Ideally I would like a category S with a bunch of
properties like:

1) Diff is a full subcategory of S
2) There is a faithful functor F: S -> CGHaus, so we can think
of smooth spaces as nice topological spaces (compactly generated
Hausdorff spaces) equipped with some extra structure.  
3) S has small limits and colimits
4) F preserves limits and colimits
5) The obvious functor from the category of simplices to CGHaus
factors through F, with the resulting smooth structure on a simplex
having reasonable properties (everyone knows what a smooth function
from a simplex to a manifold should be).

I can imagine asking much more, but this should give the idea.
I don't know much about schemes or synthetic differential geometry, 
so I don't know whether they achieve these goals.  I also don't 
know much about Pawel Gajer's "differential spaces".  Apparently
Gajer has made K(Z,n) into a "differential space" for all n; this
should be pretty easy if the category "differential spaces" has 
properties like 1)-5).  In case anyone wants to read his stuff,
here are the references:

Pawel Gajer, Geometry of Deligne cohomology, Invent. Math. 127 
(1997), 155-207.  

Pawel Gajer, Higher holonomies, geometric loop groups and smooth Deligne 
cohomology, Advances in Geometry, Birkhauser, Boston, 1999, pp. 195-235.

While I'm at it, has anyone formulated a good notion of a
"category internal to Diff"?  I.e. a gadget with a manifold
of objects, a manifold of morphisms, composition being a 
smooth map, and so on?  This would be a snap if Diff had 
finite limits, but it doesn't... which is one reason I'm 
getting annoyed!  

Should I discard Diff and work with something better instead?  

Best,
John Baez

Consider the following:

CC  =  open sets of RR^n, all n, and all smooth maps in between.

Let  DD  be the category of sets X furnished with a notion of Admisible
maps from  any object U in CC.

                 Add(U, X)  subset  Allmaps(U, X)

For each X, Add(U, X) should be a presheaf on U, and a sheaf for the open
coverings in CC.

DD is not only complete, cocomplete and cartesian closed, but also it is a
Quasitopos. Of course, it is the subcategory of separated sheaves of the
topos of sheafs on CC for the canonical topology. 

Have a full and faithfull embedding   Diff --> DD defined by:

Given a manifold M:     Add(U, M) = Diff(U, M).

There is also a faithful functor  

                         F: DD ---> EGHaus 

(topological haussdorf spaces generated by open sets of euclidean spaces,
like the manifolds)

Inspect this category, probably it has the properties you mention in your
msage.

This category is very much related with the well adapted models I
introduced for SDG. 

It is of no use for SDG since it lacks infinitesimals. This is due to the
fact that bad limits that exists in Diff (the non transversal ones) are
preserved by the embedding Diff --> DD. In  well adapted model of SDG,
Diff --> EE, only the transversal limits are preserved.

Can anyone tell me what is known about
the existence of pullbacks in the 2-category
of elementary toposes, geometric morphisms,
and natural transformations? I know (from 
Peter Johnstone's book) that pullbacks along
bounded morphisms exist. 

(I presume that when I say pullback I really 
mean bipullback, but if I should mean something 
else then do please do let me know!)

The lecture notes of my ESSLLI'01 course are now available in a revised
version at

  http://www.cwi.nl/~kurz/cml-esslli01.html

The main aim of this course has been to sketch some current approaches
to modal logics for coalgebras (Chapter 4) and to explain the duality of
modal and equational logic (Chapter 5). To make the course as
self-contained as possible, I have also included brief introductions to
applications of coalgebras in computer science, to some categorical
constructions on coalgebras, and  to modal logic.

As far as I know, the position is this. The (bi)pullback of two
morphisms f and g exists if either f or g is bounded. It seems
very likely that some such restriction is necessary, but as far
as I'm aware nobody has constructed an example of a pair of
morphisms for which the pullback is definitely known not to exist
(though there are pairs for which the pullback is not known to exist).
If anyone has such an example, please let me know!

In answer to John Baez

 >has anyone formulated a good notion of a "category internal to Diff"?
         Already in the fifties, Charles Ehresmann has introduced and
extensively studied categories internal to Diff (which he called
"categories differentiables") in his development of Differential Geometry.
His first paper essentially devoted to differentiable categories and to
their relation to locally trivial fibred spaces is
"Categories topologiques et categories differentiables", Coll. Geom. Diff.
Globale Bruxelles, CBRM (1959), 137-150.
This paper is reprinted in
"Charles Ehresmann: Oeuvres completes et commentees", Part I (ed. Andree C.
Ehresmann), Amiens 1983.
In this volume of "Oeuvres" several other papers by Charles develop this
question, and there are numerous comments by different authors giving more
information.

Remark that at that early time, the general notion of an internal category
did not yet exist, and differentiable categories were one of the examples
which motivated Charles to  introduce the notion of what he called then a
"structured category" (later renamed internal categories) in 1963 in the
 paper:
"Categories structurees", Ann. Ecole Norm. Sup. 80, Pqaris (1963), 349-426.
This paper, as well as the long series of his following papers where the
notion is refined and extensively studied, is reprinted in the same
"Oeuvres", Part III.
Though the papers are in French I have added many comments in English with
links to more recent papers of other authors.


 >the category Diff of smooth manifolds and smooth maps isn't complete
and >cocomplete.  Is there some category of "smooth spaces" that repairs
 these
 >defects?
         This is also a problem my husband and I have much studied. At this
effect, Charles has given some abstract constructions to extend a concrete
category into a concrete one with "enough" limits; in particular, in the
 paper:
"Prolongements universels d'un foncteur par adjonction de limites",
Dissertationes Math. LXIV Varsovie (1969), 1-72.
This paper is also reprinted in the "Oeuvres" Part IV, and I have added
comments in English.
His construction as well as some done by others have been unified .in a
short paper I have written after his death:
"Partial completions of concrete functors", Cahiers Top. et Geom. Diff.
XXII-3 (1981), 315-327.

The more strict problem of embedding Diff in a "good" cartesian closed
category has been handled by several authors; the first construction is in
the paper (written under my maiden name Bastiani):
"Applications differentiables et varietes de dimension infine", J. Ana.
Math. Jerusalem  XIII (1964), 1-114.
In the eighties, there are been several other constructions, e.g. the
"convenient spaces" of Frolicher.

         Sincerely
                         Andree C. Ehresmann

There's some discussion on the Universal Algebra list at present on operads.

I'm not very familiar with them. What I understand from the discussion is
they capture single sorted algebraic theories with respect to a symmetric
monoidal product ox. For each natural number n an object of n-ary operators
O_n is given, and an algebra A has operations O_n ox A^(n) -> A where A^(n)
is A ox ... ox A n times.

If you do this sort of thing with respect to categorical product, then it
already contains the information of the Lawvere theory category (for
single-sorted finitary algebraic theories), since hom(m,n) is hom(m,1)^n and
you take hom(m,1) to be O_m. But with a monoidal product this doesn't work.
It seemed to me that for proper generality the operad ought to have objects
O_mn (m, n natural numbers) representing the object of operations from A^(m)
to A^(n). Is there a name for that?

I'd agree.  You could say that an operad is exactly an algebraic theory for
which it makes sense to take models in a monoidal category.  

That should be qualified/explained a bit.  By "algebraic theory" I mean to
exclude *co*algebraic and *bi*algebraic theories: e.g. I do count the theory
of monoids, but not those of comonoids or bimonoids.  And just as monoidal
categories can come equipped with symmetries or not, so operads can come
equipped with symmetric group actions or not; the choice of flavours is
yours.  (So if you're using operads with symmetries, you should also use
monoidal categories with symmetries.)  And if the objects O_n are objects of
some monoidal category other than Set, then you're talking about "enriched
algebraic theories".

Yes: it's a PRO or a PROP (depending on whether you don't or do have
symmetries: the final P is for "permutations").  Formally, a PRO(P) is a
(symmetric) strict monoidal category whose underlying monoid of objects is
the natural numbers.  If you want your O_mn's to be objects of an arbitrary
symmetric monoidal category V (rather than just sets), then insert
"V-enriched" into the last sentence.  As far as I know, PROPs were first
thought about by Adams and Mac Lane, and subsequently developed by Boardman
and Vogt.

A model for a PRO(P) is a monoidal functor from it into some other monoidal
category.  So, for instance, there's a PRO whose models are monoids, and
another whose models are comonoids, and there's a PROP whose algebras are
bimonoids.  Thus PRO(P)s capture both the algebraic and the coalgebraic,
whereas operads only capture the algebraic.  I wouldn't interpret this as
saying that PRO(P)s exist at a more "proper" level of generality than
operads - just a different one.

(Incidentally, there's a PROP whose algebras are Hopf algebras (=bimonoids
with antipode), and an algebra for this PROP in (Set,x,1) is precisely a
group.  This contradicts the notion that it's impossible to formulate a
definition of "group" which makes sense in an arbitrary monoidal category,
although you do need your mon cat to have symmetries.)

These are called PROPs.   People in homotopy theory have been using
operads and PROPs since the 1970's.  As you note, there's no big difference
between operads and PROPs in a Cartesian category, but there is in a
more general symmetric monoidal category.   A nice example occurs
if we use Vect with its tensor product.  We can describe coalgebras
as algebras of a PROP, but not of an operad.

Nonetheless, every PROP has an underlying operad, and I believe that 
if your symmetric monoidal category has colimits, every operad freely 
generates a PROP, giving an adjunction.  

I always forget what "PROP" is an acronym for - something like 
"projection and permutation".  We can also formulate things like
operads and PROPs in the context of a monoidal category, and they
are sometimes called "planar operads" and "PROs".

            30th SPRING SCHOOL THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
               24 - 29 March, 2002 in AGAY (VAR, FRANCE)

                         EARLY REGISTRATION
                  [Apologies for multiple copies]

 This spring school aims at bringing together students and researchers
eager to learn about the fundamental questions which language designers
and implementors are facing those days, and on the most up-to-date=20
tools that theoreticians have developed or are in the process of=20
developing (such as games and ludics, or realisability for classical=20
logic and set theory).

 Denotational semantics was born some thirty years ago from the=20
encounter of computer scientists who aimed at implementation
independent definitions of programming constructs on one hand, and=20
logicians who provided mathematical tools to this aim (domain theory)=20
on the other hand. Algebraic tools such as initial algebra semantics=20
were also instrumental to the birth of this subject.

 Thirty years later, the subject has enriched considerably, both in=20
tools (including connections with proof theory and category theory) and
in coverage and applications (functional programming, state, control,=20
objects, parallelism, mobility,...). Concepts and constructs that have=20
arisen in the design of programming languages have found counterparts=20
in logic, logical systems have found their way to applications in the=20
form of proof assistants, etc... The rapid development of new=20
programming paradigms, in which distributed computation takes a more=20
and more important part, infers a strong demand on theory, more than=20
ever.

 With the rise of quite specialized subcommunities (like type theory,

can address the interrelations between research areas in rapid growth,
and between theory-oriented research work and more goal-oriented one,
with the prospect of solving problems or of improving our understanding
in one domain using tools of another domain. The diversity of the=20
proposed lectures, combined with their conceptual overall unity (as=20
witnessed by the very limited number of core formal systems:=20
lambda-calculus, linear logic, pi-calculus) addresses this issue.

Hi, I have a question.  If P and Q are objects in a 2-category C, and the=
re is an equivalence between them, must there be an adjoint equivalence (=
an adjunction whose unit and counit are both isomorphisms) between them? =
 Mac Lane answers this affirmatively in the case C =3D Cat, but, as far a=

Thanks for your help

The answer is yes. Let  f : Q --> P  and  u : P --> Q  be arrows in a 
2-category K with an invertible 2-cell  e : f u --> 1  and some 
invertible 2-cell q : 1 --> u f  (some say  f  is quasi-inverse to 
u).  The existence of  q  implies that the functor  K(X,f)  is fully 
faithful for all objects  X  of  K.  We define the unit  n : 1 --> u 
f  by the condition that  f n  should be the inverse of  e f  (using 
fullness of  K(Q,f)).  So one adjunction triangle is satisfied.  The 
other follows by the faithfulness of  K(P,f).

An application of this is that a pseudonatural transformation 
(between pseudofunctors) which is a pointwise equivalence has a 
quasi-inverse pseudonatural transformation.

Yes, and constructing this adjoint equivalence is an incredibly 
fun exercise in playing around with diagrams for 2-morphisms in 
your 2-category!  The proof must appear in the literature, but 
I don't know where, and it's really much better to do this sort
of thing oneself.  Knowing that it's possible should give you the
gumption to do it.  But if you get stuck, you can find the basic 
trick in the proof of Prop. 27 in my paper "Higher-dimensional 
algebra II: 2-Hilbert Spaces", which is available at

http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/q-alg/9609018

Ignore the rather complicated context and just stare at the formulas.

Best,
jb

A couple of weeks ago, Walter Tholen asked whether, if a map of
locales f: X --> Y has the property that pulling back along f
preserves closures of sublocales, then f is necessarily open.
(The converse is true, and the corresponding condition for spaces
is equivalent to openness.) I found a counterexample, and posted
it on this mailing list. Subsequently Walter asked me a
supplementary question: if f stably has the property above
(i.e. all pullbacks of f have the property), is it necessarily
open? I now have a positive answer to this question, which may
be of interest to people who read my earlier posting; so here it is.

To prove the result for spaces, one argues as follows: given an open
U \subseteq X, consider the complement V of the image f_!U in Y. The
inclusion V \subseteq cl V is dense, so it must pull back to a dense
inclusion; but f^*V \cap U is empty, so this implies f^*(cl V) \cap U
is empty, i.e. cl V is disjoint from f_!U. So V = cl V is closed, and
hence f_!U is open.

The reason why this argument doesn't work for locales is, of course,
that f_!U need not have a complement in the lattice of sublocales of Y.
However, if we know that f_!U is a closed sublocale of Y, then the
argument works exactly as for spaces, since closed sublocales are
complemented. So the trick is to pull back along a morphism
\tilde{Y} --> Y such that the pullback of f_!U becomes closed;
specifically, we take the frame {\cal O}(\tilde{Y}) to be the subframe
of the assembly of Y (the frame of all nuclei on Y) generated by the
closed nuclei together with the nucleus j corresponding to f_!U.

We need an explicit description of the elements of this frame: but it
is easy to see that they are all nuclei of the form
(j \cap c(V)) \cup c(W), where V and W are opens of Y (and we may as
well assume V \supseteq W, i.e. c(V) \geq c(W)). Then we observe that
j acquires a complement in this frame iff there exist V and W such that

0 = j \cap ((j\cap c(V))\cup c(W)) = j\cap c(V)  and
1 = j \cup ((j\cap c(V))\cup c(W)) = j\cup c(W)

(where 0 and 1 denote the bottom and top elements of the frame of
nuclei). But this is equivalent to saying that j is already open as
a nucleus on {\cal O}(Y). In other words, if f_!U becomes open when
pulled back to a sublocale of \tilde{Y}, then it was already open as
a sublocale of Y.

Of course, it needs checking that, in the square

  \tilde{U} -------> \tilde{f_!U}
     |                  |
     |                  |
     |                  |
     v                  v
  \tilde{X} -------> \tilde{Y}

obtained by pulling back along \tilde{Y} --> Y, the top edge is an
epimorphism, so that \tilde{f_!U} is the image of \tilde{U} under
\tilde{f}. But this follows easily from the fact that, for any
g: Z --> Y, \tilde{Z} is the locale corresponding to the frame
obtained from {\cal O}(Z) by `declaring g^*(f_!U) to be closed'.
For we have f^*(f_!U) \supseteq U, and hence \tilde{U} --> U is
an isomorphism, as is \tilde{f_!U} --> f_!U.

Rosebrugh and Wood [Proc AMS 122(2), 409-413, 1994] characterized Set up to
equivalence as the only category with a string of four adjoints to the left
of its Yoneda embedding.  A slew of questions about infinite sets being up
for grabs, such as the number of infinite cardinals less than 2^N, it is
clear that any such on-the-nose characterization must smuggle in much if
not all of what it sets out to characterize.

Finite sets do not raise these sorts of questions, removing the above
argument for the inevitability of smuggling set-theoretic knowledge into
a characterization of FinSet.

Now some logicians such as Sol Feferman, and one imagines at least a
few category theorists, view category theory as built on set theory.
An alternative viewpoint is that the basic notions of category theory exist
independently of the category of sets.  Where one sits in this spectrum is
presumably correlated with how strongly one feels that set theory has been
smuggled into the following.

For ignorance of the correct name I'll call an object b "strongly
indecomposable" when Hom(b,-) preserves binary sums.  "Successor object" seems
like a reasonable name for an object of the form b+1 (1 the final object).
Write FinC for the full subcategory of C whose objects have finitely many
elements (morphisms from 1).

Claim.  Let C be a category with finite sums and final object 1.  If 1 is
a strongly indecomposable generator and every object is either initial or
a successor, then FinC is equivalent to FinSet.

(Set, FinSet, and Stone all meet these conditions on C, which could be
weakened without changing the conclusion by replacing "finite sums" by
"sums with 1" and "strongly indecomposable" (SI) by the requirement that b+1
have exactly one element not an element of b.  Or, the dichotomy condition
could be strengthened to "For all a,b there exists c such that either
a ~ b+c or b ~ a+c.")

Proof: Given b in FinC, use dichotomy to shed its n elements sequentially
yielding b = 0+1+...+1.  SI prevents loss or repetition of any element.
For any c (in FinC or not), |0=>c| = 1 since 0 is initial, and by induction
on n, |b=>c| >= |c|^n.  But 1 generates so |b=>c| <= |c|^n.

Pointers to previous appearances of this would be appreciated.

Do other familiar categories besides finite sets have a similarly short and
elementary characterization, e.g. finite Boolean algebras, finite Abelian
groups, finite posets, finite monoids, etc?

Finite Boolean algebras are easily characterized as dual finite sets.
Specifically, for any category C with finite products and initial object 2,
if 2 is a strongly coindecomposable cogenerator and every object is either
final or of the form 2xb, then FinC is equivalent to FinBool.  Bool, FinBool,
and CABA all satisfy these conditions on C.

("2 strongly coindecomposable" means of course that Hom(-,2) sends finite
products to finite sums; equivalently, every predicate q:axb->2 on axb
factors through exactly one of the projections p1:axb->a, p2:axb->b,
i.e. it acts as a predicate on one of a or b and is constant on the other.)

Have we smuggled Boolean algebra into this argument?  Is category theory based
on set theory to any greater extent than on Boolean algebra?  And is there
any essential difference between this argument and its mate for FinSet?
Sets and Boolean algebras would seem to deserve equal credit for their
foundational role in both.

My own view, first articulated in LICS'95, 444-454, is that mathematics is
a catenary, the "Stone Gamut," held up at each end by the twin categories
Set and CABA.  The catenary is created from their interaction.

Any suggestions for characterizing finite Abelian groups?

Hello


I would need please a bibliographical reference for the following
theorem : "consider a complete cocomplete cartesian closed category
C. Then the category of internal 1-categories of C is complete 
cocomplete and ccartesian closed". I need it for the redaction of
a proof. Thanks in advance.

There is a nice lemma on adjoint functors, purely 2-categorical, and
certainly known to various colleagues.

As I need it in a paper on homotopy, I would like to know if it is
*published with proof*, somewhere.
I also like to "advertise" it here, because I think it deserves to be known
more widely.

LEMMA.

If,in an adjunction, any one of the four natural transformations which
appear in the triangle identities is invertible, so are the other three.
[Proof below.]

A few years ago I was considering such adjunctions, which I was calling
"connections" because adjunctions between ordered sets ("covariant Galois
connections") are always of this type.
Renato Betti was also considering them, under the name of "exact
adjunctions" (which I now prefer, also because "connection" has already too
many meanings).
I learnt from him that "one condition is sufficient".

At my knowledge, the above result appears in two works. It is cited without
proof in

- R.Betti, Adjointness in descent theory,
JPAA 116 (1997), 41-47.

It also appears, with a proof and in a more general formulation (for
biadjoints), in a preprint:

- R.Betti, D. Schumacher and R. Street, Factorizations in bicategories,
Dip. Mat. Politecnico di Milano n. 22/R, 1999.

___


Proof.

Write  F -| G  the adjunction;
u: 1 -> GF  the unit;  v: FG -> 1  the counit.

   The triangle identities say that

 (a)  vF.Fu = idF,    (b)  Gv.uG = idG.

   Assume that  Fu  is invertible, so that also  vF  is so and it is
sufficient to prove that:

(c) uG.Gv = id(GFG).

        This commposite occurs in the upper row of the following
commutative diagram
(vertical arrows down)

            Gv         uG
      GFG  ---->  G   ---->  GFG

  uGFG |          |uG         |uGFG

     GFGFG ----> GFG  ----> GFGFG
           GFGv       GFuG

   Now, the lower row is the identity, because  G(Fu)G  is invertible and
the "other composite", GF(Gv.uG)  is an identity, by (b). Since the
vertical arrow  uGFG  has a left inverse, by (b) again, "cancelling it from
the outer rectangle" we get (c).

[Perhaps it can be simplified; I did not spent much time for that.]

   "If P and Q are objects in a 2-category C, and there is an equivalence
 between them, must there be an adjoint equivalence (an adjunction whose 
unit and counit are both isomorphisms) between them?"


Thanks Richard, Ross and John for your affirmative answer.  I would have
preferred a counterexample, but that's life.  I'm trying to make an
argument that the natural 2-categorical analogue of isomorphism is adjoint
equivalence rather than equivalence, but your result suggests that it
doesn 't matter.

What about automorphism groups?  Say we have an object P in a 2-category
C.  We can either consider the category (strict monoidal with inverses) of
auto - adjoint equivalences on P and transformations between them, or we
can consider the category (strict monoidal with inverses) of auto -
equivalences on P and transformations between them.  Must these be
equivalent?


Thanks
Paul

If  F:C-->C is a functor with opposite  F*:C*-->C*
then (F-algebras)* is trivially equivalent to (F*)-coalgebras.
Can this duality be induced by a schizophrenic object?

Hi, I just found the result I asked for yesterday in Blackwell, Kelly,
Power, Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra vol. 59.  I hadn't noticed it.

Looking at the discussion in that paper, I see that I should have been
more precise in phrasing my question today.  By "equivalence from C to D"
I meant "a 4-tuple (f,g,eta,mu) such that...".  I didn't mean "an f such
that there exists g,eta,mu such that...", as I belong to the "don't put
existential quantifiers in categorical definitions" school of thought.

Sorry for any confusion
Paul

I can't provide a reference for this result, but my ex-students will
testify that it has been an exercise on the problem sets for my first-year
graduate course in category theory for at least the last ten years. Also,
in my review of Francis Borceux' "Handbook of Categorical Algebra" for
the Bulletin of the London Math Soc., I referred to the result as a
"shibboleth" for testing whether someone is a genuine category theorist:
if he recognizes it as something he's always known, then he is a true
category-theorist, otherwise not. (This in the context that Borceux
appeared not to be aware of the result.)

Incidentally, "idempotent adjunction" seems to me a better name than
"exact adjunction".

In response to Ronnie Brown's inquiries about "embeddability"
and cartesian closed categories, the following three publications
may be of interest:

F.W. Lawvere
Volterra's Functionals and the Covariant Cohesion of Space
Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo (2) Supplemento No. 64, 2000,
pp 201-204.

    This paper is partly about the history of the problem
with which Ronnie is concerned, but I only later became aware of the
significance of the following two papers:

Ralph H. Fox
On Topologies for Function Spaces
Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 51, 1945, pp 429-432

    This paper is often cited, but note that it states explicitly that
it was written in response to a question in a letter by W. Hurewicz.

David Gale
Compact Sets of Functions and Function Rings
Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 1, 1950, pp 303-308

    Here David Gale states that the definition of k-space was due to
W. Hurewicz.


    Thus it appears that both the statement of the problem, as well as
its standard solution were given by W. Hurewicz.  The relevance to
homotopy theory as well as to functional analysis was recognized over
fifty years ago.

    There are actually many similar categories;  an axiomatic approach
(rather than a pragmatic one) is required in order to systematize the
relation  between them.  They can be "normalized", as Peter Johnstone did
for the sequential case, to become toposes; this should clarify the
comparisons as well as provide categories with much more "convenient"
exactness properties.

Set theory has been smuggled into the whole argument in an all-pervading
way, and moreover in a specifically classical form. This causes problems
when you start exploring more adventurously the nature of sethood. The
argument about finiteness is then much less help than it might have
appeared at first. 

As a particular example that category theory helps us to explore, we know
there are benefits to be had from thinking of sheaves as sets (continuously
parametrized by points of spaces, but the trick is to keep the parameter
under wraps). They are benefits that do not depend on having recourse to
some fixed classical notion of "actual" sets, unparametrized.

There are important notions of finiteness for sheaves that require
investigation. For instance, "Kuratowski finiteness" underlies the
logically important notion of finitely bounded universal quantification.
But the categories of sheaves do not in general get off the ground with
Vaughan's results, since we do not have that every sheaf is either initial
or a successor. Hence the results make little contribution to understanding
finiteness for sheaves.

Let me present another concrete set theory that, to my mind, provides
foundations just as good as those of classical set theory.

Buy a lorry load of ready-mixed concrete. Spread it evenly over your front
drive. Wade into the middle of it and wait for it to set.

Now if you want to explore beyond the margins of your front drive you will
be safe, because you have a good solid bit of concrete to support you.

Harsh? To bring the sheaves into classical set theory requires quite
cumbersome machinery. We do better to find out what really makes the
sheaves work rather than insistently reducing them to a notion of set that
we know to be ill-matched. Only then can we, as the psalm puts it, "return
with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with us".

the following is in the appendix of my paper Maps II

ftp://ftp.kestrel.edu/pub/papers/pavlovic/mapsII.ps.gz

Lemma. Let R be a bicategory. Suppose we are given 0-cells A and B,
1-cells F:A->B and G:B->A and 2-cells h:id_A --> FG and e:GF -->id_B.
Then F is left adjoint to G if and only if the 2-cells

   hF;Fe : F --> FGF --> F
   Gh;eG : G --> GFG --> G

are both split epi (or split mono).

the paper was published in 1996, but this particular lemma (with the
proof) was announced on this list shortly after i arrived to mcgill,
probably in january or february of 1992.

I so testify.  Example sheet 2, question 3.  As I recall, I couldn't
do it at the time :-(

Surprisingly, the result doesn't seem to be in CWM (Mac Lane).

It is, however, in Lambek & Scott (Introduction to Higher Order
Categorical Logic), in their brief introductory section.  It is the
content of Proposition 4.2 and Lemma 4.3, as far as I can see.

Hi Marco -

I learned about the fact that you are alluding to when I took my first course
on category theory with Nico Pumpluen in 1969 at the University of Muenster,
and this is documented in his extended and mimeographed lecture notes (as "Satz
4.4") that I was in charge of producing when he gave the course again in 1972.
It may have been "folklore" knowledge already at that time. Nico called such
adjunctions Galois adjunctions, but I agree with Peter that idempotent
adjunction is the better name.
Well, all this may not really be an answer to your question, depending on what
you call "published", in which case you can take this as background
information.

Best regards,
Walter.

Since the concept of "finite set" is sitting right in the definition
of FinC, we have to know all about finite sets to use this characterization
of FinSet... but I wouldn't be surprised if that annoying circularity
is inevitable.  

I wonder if anyone knows a reference to this characterization, 
which is simpler and perhaps more blatantly circular:

Claim: FinSet is the free category with finite sums on one object.

This is supposed to be a short way of saying that if C is a
category with finite sums containing an object x, there is
a finite-sum-preserving functor F: FinSet -> C, unique up to
natural isomorphism, such that F(1) = x.  It's a categorification
of the fact that the natural numbers are the free commutative
monoid on one generators.  I think it's even true.  

I think this is also true:

Claim: FinSet is the free biCartesian category on nothing.

This is supposed to be a short way of saying that if C is a
category with finite sums and finite products, the latter
distributing over the former, then there is is a finite-sum-and-
product-preserving functor F: FinSet -> C, unique up to natural
isomorphism.  It's a categorification of the fact that the natural
numbers are the free commutative rig on no generators.  

Personally I find this sort of characterization a bit more
illuminating than Vaughan's.  Throughout math, as soon as you
define some nice sort of gadget, you instantly focus on the
free gadgets of this sort - which are probably the ones you knew
about before you even made the definition!  It's a circular
business, but that's life.

Best,
John Baez

In answer to Philippe Gaucher who asks for

 >a bibliographical reference for the following theorem : "consider a
 complete
 >cocomplete cartesian closed category C. Then the category of internal 1-
 >categories of C is complete cocomplete and cartesian closed".

This theorem (and also a more general one for models of a sketch in a
category ) has been proved in our paper:

         "Categories of sketched structures",
         by Andree Bastiani (my maiden name) and Charles Ehresmann,
         Cahiers de Top. et Geom. Diff. XIII-2 (1972), 1-107,  reprinted in
         "Charles Ehresmann; Oeuvres completes et commentees" Part IV-2,
         pp. 407-517.

In particular, in Sections 12 and 13 we give two constructions, one valid
for all sketches, the other particular to the case of internal categories.
This last construction generalizes a construction we had given in a
preceding paper:
         "Categories de foncteurs structures", Cahiers TGD XI-3 (1969),
329-384,         reprinted in the Oeuvres Part IV-1
in the case of categories internal to a concrete category.

         Hoping these old references may be of some help,

I wonder what happens in the case of more than one generator. For
instance, the free category with finite sums on two objects is FinSet
x FinSet. In the case where the set of generators is discrete, it does
not make a difference if one also adds coequalizers, e.g.

 FinSet is the free category with finite colimits on one object.

What about the case where one has morphisms on the generators? From
[Mac Lane], we know:

 If D is any diagram (small category), then its free co-completion is 
 the Yoneda category Set^{D^op}.

Is this still true when inserting the word "finite"?

 If D is any diagram, then its free completion under finite colimits
 is FinSet^{D^op}?

And what happens if one drops the coequalizers? Does the free
completion of a diagram D under coproducts have a Yoneda-like
characterization?

In response to John Baez and Steve Vickers, let me put my question more
directly.  What categories of "finite" (in any sense of finite you like)
objects can be characterized up to equivalence as the finite objects (again
feel free to define this notion yourself) common to all categories of some
elementary class?

I showed that finite sets and finite Boolean algebras could be so
characterized.  What about finite Abelian groups, or finitely presented
(by generators and relators) Abelian groups, or finite dimensional vector
spaces over some field?  Once an appropriate notion of finiteness is settled
on, these become straightforward yes-no questions.

A related question is, what categories can be characterized up to equivalence
by purely elementary means?  I hope it's clear why I asked what I did and
not this.  (Loewenheim-Skolem and all that.)

Like John Baez, I like free algebras and cofree coalgebras as methods
of characterization.  (Why else would Dusko Pavlovic and I bother to
characterize the continuum as a cofree coalgebra?)  I would immediately
withdraw whatever I said that conveyed the opposite if I knew what it was.
In asking about definability in a given framework (here first order logic
plus cardinality restrictions) I had not intended to imply even endorsement
of that framework, let alone rejection of other frameworks.

In defense of sets, I very much like them as a foundational concept, in
considerable part because one can reach a larger audience by starting from
sets than from sheaves.  I was impressed that anyone would dislike sets so
much as to compare starting from them to standing in wet concrete until it
sets (or were you just making a pun about sets, Steve?).

Sheaves as a starting point is fine for category theorists, who are equipped
to benefit from its greater generality, but they are singularly inappropriate
for most other mathematical audiences, for most of whom experience with
adding up the restaurant bill has made natural numbers much more familiar
than sheaves.  I'm not objecting to crash courses on sheaves here, just
to talks for a general mathematical audience that start out "Ladies and
gentlemen, let S be a sheaf."

Mentioning categories on Steve Simpson's FOM mailing list typically brings
on a diatribe from someone railing against categories.  It would be nice
if one could mention sets on this mailing list without the analogous response.

John Baez makes exactly the right connection between sets and the free
monoid on one generator (Peter Selinger made a related remark to me
privately about the free cocomplete category on one generator satisfying
FinC ~ FinSet).  The categorification of the semiring of natural numbers
yielding the distributive category of sets is natural, simple, beautiful,
and easily understood.

However I disagree that the assumption of finiteness constitutes smuggling
in FinSet.  A tiny part of it, fine, but that's a long way from smuggling in
the whole notion of function.  The notion of linear order with endpoints can
be characterized elementarily up to isomorphism if one restricts attention
to countable linear orders, but how much of the notion of linear order does
countability smuggle in here?

Cardinality restrictions as an axiomatization strategy convey no substantial
structural information, and are one of the mildest possible excursions
outside first order logic when such is unavoidable.  They have a long and
distinguished history in logic.

Hello,

what kind of characterization do you want? If you accept ZFC as 
"outside world", then there is no elementary characterization of 
FinSet (in the sense of finitary first-order logic) because every 
ultrapower of FinSet satisfies the same (finitary) first-order 
sentences.

No, I was in earnest. Having over quite a few years now seen for myself the
possibilities of using constructive reasoning to _simplify_ mathematics, so
that it now seems very obvious, I get overquickly distressed when other
people still haven't seen it.

However, I should explain that I was not criticizing sets as pedagogic
foundations, where you start from when you're explaining to a large
audience, nor as (if I may use Paul Taylor's phrase) practical foundations,
since the naive concepts of sets (albeit non-classical ones) underly the way
one reasons in toposes. The parable about concrete concerned philosophical
foundations, trying to fix on classical set theory as the deep unifying
account of what mathematics depends on.

Maybe in any case Vaughan wasn't thinking so much about such philosophical
diversions.

There is a pragmatic message. There are a number of different
characterizations of finiteness. Classically they are all equivalent, but it
has been known to topos theorists for quite a while now that if you start
considering non-classical sets (such as sheaves) or computational structures
you find they are inequivalent.

My belief is that the explanations of the differences can be understood in
naive set theoretic terms, though to see why they are genuine differences
and not just presentational you need to know a bit more about sheaves and
such.

A particular message (really arising out of geometric logic) is that
finiteness is _structure_ on a set, and not just a property: How do you know
a set is finite? There is something there in its structure that tells you.
I've tried to bring this out in my paper "Strongly algebraic = SFP
(topically)", soon to appear in Math. Structures in Computer Science, and
also available through my web page http://mcs.open.ac.uk/sjv22. In
particular you see there discussed Kuratowski finiteness (you can list of
all the elements but can't necessarily remove duplicates), finite decidable
(in addition you can detect inequality between elements and so can remove
duplicates) and finite ordinals (there is a canonical list that thereby puts
an ordering on the elements).

Consequently, when giving (as Vaughan did) a categorical characterization of
finiteness, it's worth pausing to consider which kind of finiteness you are
characterizing. Some will be more fruitful than others in terms of how
successfully they can generalize to the non-classical sets - with some you
will be stuck in your concrete, with others you can explore further afield.
The particular one Vaughan described was closely tied to the classical set
theory, but that is a limitation that is not inherent in the broad questions
he was asking.

That's a bit more subtle than saying "finite sets" are now characterized,
and treating "finite sheaves" as an interesting topic of further study along
with "finite Abelian groups" and so on. There is virtue in finding answers
for "finite sets" that also apply to "finite sheaves".

Sorry if I railed. The categories list has the big advantage that its
readership is very well informed about both sets and categories, and fully
in a position to base their opinions on the mathematics and not the railing.

All the best,

Steve Vickers.

Here's some stuff James Dolan and I talked about last Friday when
discussing Paul Levy's question about the difference between an
equivalence and an adjoint equivalence.  Pardon the glitzy writing
style: this is part of my column "This Week's Finds", where I can't
count on people staying awake for category theory unless I spice it 
up a bit.  You can find the whole column here:

First, consider the "Platonic idea of an equivalence".  By this, I mean
the 2-category Equiv which is freely generated by objects a and b,
morphisms L: a -> b and R: b -> a, and isomorphisms i: 1_b => RL and 
e: LR => 1_a.   Why do I call this the "Platonic idea of an equivalence"? 
Well, any equivalence in any 2-category C is just the same as a 2-functor 

F: Equiv -> C

The functor F turns the "abstract" equivalence in Equiv into a
"concrete" equivalence in C!  This is reminiscent of Plato's theory
of ideas and how they get manifested in concrete situations.  We can
think of Equiv as the unadorned idea of an adjunction without any
contamination by accidental extra features.

I should add that James, less of an intellectual snob than I, calls
Equiv the "walking equivalence".  After all, if someone has really big
bushy eyebrows, so that when you see him walking down the street you
first notice his eyebrows and only later realize there's a person
attached, you call him a "walking pair of eyebrows".  The person is 
basically just the life support system for the eyebrows!  Similarly, in
Equiv we have a 2-category which is just the life support system for an
adjunction: no more and no less.   

Anyway, the walking equivalence is a weak 2-groupoid: a 2-category where
every 2-morphism is invertible and every morphism is invertible up to
2-isomorphism.  Weak 2-groupoids are secretly the same thing as homotopy
2-types: roughly speaking, topological spaces whose homotopy groups 
vanish above dimension 2.  And there's a pretty easy way to turn a weak
2-groupoid into a homotopy 2-type.  First you turn it into a simplicial
set, called its "nerve", and then you take the geometric realization of
that.  

Eh?  Well, I talked about geometric realization in part E of "week116",
and I talked about the nerve of a 1-category in part J of "week117", so
the only thing I need to do is say a bit about the nerve of a 2-category.
This is a simplicial set where the 0-simplices correspond to objects:


                            x


the 1-simplices correspond to morphisms:


                    x ------F-------> y


the 2-simplices correspond to 2-morphisms:


                            y
                           / \                F: x -> y 
                          /   \               G: y -> z
                         / ||  \              H: x -> z
                        F  ||   G             a: FG => H
                       /   ||a   \
                      /    \/     \
                     x------H----->z


and the higher-dimensional simplices correspond to equations, "equations
between equations", and so on.  

Anyway, if you use this trick to turn the walking equivalence into
a space, what space do you get?  

The 2-sphere!  

It's pretty easy to see... I'd draw it for you on paper if I could, but
you'll have to do it yourself.  It helps if you have a globe:

a is the North Pole, 
b is the South Pole, 
L: a -> b is the Greenwich Meridian running from north to south, 
R: b -> a is the International Date Line running from south to north, 
i: 1_a => LR is the Eastern Hemisphere, and 
e: RL => 1_b is the Western Hemisphere!

(More precisely, we just get the 2-sphere up to homotopy equivalence:
there is a whole bunch of higher-dimensional flab which I'm ignoring
here.  But that's okay, since we're doing homotopy theory.)

We can also play this game for the "walking adjoint equivalence",
AdEquiv.  This is just like the walking equivalence, except we put in
extra relations: the triangle equations.  How does this affect the space
we get?

It's very beautiful: the extra equations fill in the 2-sphere to give us
a 3-ball!  

Now, the 3-ball is contractible, so as a homotopy type it's really the
same as a point.  And a point is exactly the space we'd get from playing
the same game starting with the "walking object": the 2-category with
one object, its identity morphism, and the identity 2-morphism of that.

To the eyes of a homotopy theorist, a point and 3-ball are the same, but
the 2-sphere is not.   Similarly, to the eyes of an n-category theorist,
the walking object and the walking adjoint equivalence are "the same",
but the walking equivalence is not!   

We could make this very precise with a suitable notion of "sameness" for
2-categories.  But instead, let's jump straight to the punchline: having
an adjoint equivalence in a 2-category is "the same" as having an
object.... but having an equivalence is not!

There's even more fun to be had here.  Since every adjoint equivalence
is an equivalence, there's a 2-functor

I: Equiv -> AdEquiv

But I also said every equivalence can be massaged to obtain an adjoint
equivalence!  In fact, I said it could be done in two equally good ways.
Either of these gives a 2-functor

P: AdEquiv -> Equiv

Now, we can ask what these become when we turn them into maps between
spaces....

It turns out that I is just the inclusion of the 2-sphere into the
3-ball, while P is the map that squashes the 3-ball down to either the
eastern or western hemisphere of the sphere!  

By the way, it is irresistible to predict generalizations to higher
dimensions.  For any n, we will have weak n-groupoids called Equiv, the
"walking n-equivalence", and AdEquiv, the "walking adjoint
n-equivalence".  The geometric realization of the nerve of Equiv will be
homotopy equivalent to the n-sphere, while that of AdEquiv will be
homotopy equivalent to the (n+1)-ball.

(Note that for n = 1, Equiv will be the category with objects
a and b and isomorphisms L: a -> b, R: b -> a.   In AdEquiv, there
will be extra relations saying that R is the inverse of L.  In
this sense, it is really an adjoint equivalence rather than an
equivalence which is the proper generalization of an isomorphism!)

>Claim: FinSet is the free biCartesian category on nothing.

What is the justification for including in the term "biCartesian"
that the products distribute over the coproducts?
If you add that the Cartesian product is closed
(which it is in FinSet), *then* you get this, of course.
So FinSet is either the free biCartesian category
where products distribute over coproducts on nothing,
or else the free Cartesian closed coCartesian category on nothing.
It would be nice to have a single term like "biCartesian"
for either of these concepts, but I don't see the justification,
especially since the concept isn't very symmetric.

Indeed, so long as category theory begins with <Let Ob(C) be a set.>,
then some set theory can't help but be smuggled in.
If you say <FinSet is the free finitely complete category on 1 object.>,
then you're asking Mor(D) to be a finite set
(where D is the diagram in a limit being considered),
but you already have to ask Mor(D) to be a set,
so this doesn't smuggle in any more set theory than was already there.

WITH APOLOGIES FOR MULTIPLE POSTINGS


PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS


2nd International Conference on

VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS


Liverpool, UK, September  9 - 12, 2002


Contributions are invited for a multi-disciplinary workshop on Visual
Representations and Interpretations.  This will be a multi-disciplinary
meeting exploring all aspects of visual images, their interpretation,
representation and modeling, and their relationships to other forms of
human knowledge and activities.


SCOPE AND AIMS OF THE WORKSHOP
The value of multi-disciplinary research, the exchanging of ideas and
methods across traditional discipline boundaries, is well recognised.=20
It could be argued that many of the advances in science and engineering
take place because the ideas, methods and the tools of thought from one
discipline become re-applied in others.

The topic of "the visual" has become increasingly important as advances
in technology have led to multi-media and multi-modal representations,
and extended the range and scope of visual representation and
interpretation in our lives.  Under this broad heading there are many
different perspectives and approaches, from across the entire spectrum
of human knowledge and activity.  The development of advanced graphics
for computer games and film animations, for example, has drawn on and
led developments in computational geometry.  Even outside the
technological sphere, recent controversies over artworks which some have
considered to be blasphemous show the power of the visual to manifest
wildly different interpretations, and to become a topic of everyday
conversation and a focus of political activity.

One goal of this workshop on Visual Representations and Interpretations
is to break down cross-disciplinary barriers, by bringing together
people working in a wide variety of disciplines where visual
representations and interpretations are exploited.

The first Workshop on Visual Representations and Interpretations was
held in Liverpool in 1998.  Contributions to the workshop came from
researchers actively investigating visual representations and
interpretations in a wide variety of areas including: art, architecture,
biology, chemistry, clinical medicine, cognitive science, computer
science, education, engineering, graphic design, linguistics,
mathematics, philosophy, physics, psychology and social science.

VRI2002 aims to build on this good beginning, and to provide a forum for
wide-ranging and multi-disciplinary discussion on visual representations
and interpretations.  Contributions on any aspect of visual
representations and interpretations are welcomed, including, though of
course not limited to:

- visual representation languages
- film and photographic interpretation
- art as argument
- diagrams and sketches
- the philosophy, sociology and politics of art and images
- formalization and representation of images
- visual human-machine interaction
- connections between visual and other human senses
- computational geometry
- diagrammatic reasoning
- the modeling of patterns and form
- blueprints and scale models
- visual metaphors and knowledge discovery


SUBMISSIONS
Contributions in the form of original research papers are invited.
Papers should be a maximum of 12 pages in length.  There will be the

MoSIS is a IKT project funded by the Norwegian Science Council (NFR)
for the period 2002-2005. Its descriptive full title is:

          Modularity in large Software and Information Systems

Modularization techniques are essential for mastering the complexity of large
systems. There are many approaches: agents, components, libraries, ...
The overall aim of the project is to develop a conceptual and formal
framework for the composition and interaction of software modules at 
various levels of abstraction. The two relevant subprojects aim at
applying formal techniques based on type theory, algebra and/or 
category theory to programming `in the large'. For more information
on the project, see http://www.ii.uib.no/MoSIS 
 
2. The profile of the candidates.
---------------------------------
You have a Master degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Informatics,
Mathematics or Logic. You enjoy working in an internationally oriented, 
English speaking research environment.

3. The jobs. 
------------
The positions are opening up in 2002 and last for three years. 
There are in principle no teaching duties. There is a perspective
for prolongation of at most one year as a research associate.
The salary is about EUR 32.000 per year. 

4. Information and how to apply.
--------------------------------
More information can be obtained from Prof.Dr. M.A. Bezem (bezem@ii.uib.no).
You are invited to send an application letter by e-mail, together with
a curriculum vitae and the names and addresses of two references,
before 21 December 2001. Applicants from outside the European 
Economic Area (EEA) will be considered. 
In a later stage of the procedure we may ask you to write a formal
application to the faculty.

5. Bergen, Norway.
------------------
Bergen is the second-largest city in Norway, beautifully situated
between 7 mountains (up to 600m) and fjords. Bergen has about 230.000
inhabitants and all facilities, including a nearby airport. The climate
(including tax pressure) is milder than most people expect, but it
can rain quite hard, indeed. For more information on

           CATEGORY THEORY AND COMPUTER SCIENCE (CTCS'02)
                        AUGUST 15-17, 2002
                       University of Ottawa
                       
                       FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS 


CTCS '02 is the 9th Conference on Category Theory and Computer
Science. The purpose of the conference series is the advancement of
the foundations of computing using the tools of category theory. 
The emphasis is upon applications of category theory, but it is 
recognized that the area is highly interdisciplinary.

Typical topics of interest include, but are not limited to,
category-theoretic aspects of the following:

coalgebras and computing
concurrent and distributed systems 
constructive mathematics
declarative programming and term rewriting 
domain theory and topology
foundations of computer security
linear logic 
modal and temporal logics
models of computation 
program logics, data refinement, and specification 
programming language semantics 
type theory

Previous meetings have been held in Guildford (Surrey), Edinburgh (twice),
Manchester, Paris, Amsterdam, Cambridge, and S. Margherita Ligure
(Genova). This is the first time CTCS will be held in North America.

One new feature that CTCS will have this year is a "preconference", during 
which we will offer courses in the basic areas underlying
the field of the conference. The goal is to prepare students to be able to 
attend and participate in CTCS. So anyone who has graduate students or 
advanced undergraduates who they think would be interested in attending 
should contact us. We anticipate having some funding from Centre de 
Recherches Mathematiques (CRM) to cover part of the costs.

I have just put a new paper of mine on the web at

   http://mcs.open.ac.uk/sjv22/PPandExp.ps

Steve Vickers.

Details:

"The double powerlocale and exponentiation: A case study in geometric logic"
Steven Vickers.

If X is a locale, then its double powerlocale PP(X) is defined to
be P_U(P_L(X)) where P_U and P_L are the upper and lower
powerlocale constructions. We prove various results relating it to
exponentiation of locales, including the following. First, if X is a
locale for which the exponential $^X exists (where $
is the Sierpinski locale), then PP(X) is an exponential $^($^X).
Second, if in addition W is a locale for which PP(W)
is homeomorphic to $^X, then X is an exponential $^W.

The work uses geometric reasoning, i.e. reasoning stable under pullback
along geometric morphisms, and this enables the locales to be discussed in
terms of their points as though they were spaces. It relies on a number of
geometricity results including those for locale presentations and for
powerlocales.

John Baez described the ``platonic idea of an equivalence'' or
``walking equivalence''. (This has also been called the ``free-living
equivalence''.) He also describes the free-living adjoint equivalence,
and the homotopy-theoretic relationship between the two.

Similarly, one can construct the free-living adjunction. This was
done in

     S. Schanuel and R. Street, The free adjunction, Cah. Top. Geom.
     Diff. 27:81-83, 1986.

John also points out that one can consider not just equivalences,
but 2-equivalences, 3-equivalences, and so on. The free-living
pseudo-adjunction was constructed in
     
     Stephen Lack, A coherent approach to pseudomonads, Adv. Math.
     152:179-202, 2000.

from a rather different point of view to that of Schanuel and Street.

Steve Lack.

These categories are often called distributive. For an introduction
to them, and their relationship with extensive categories, see the
paper:

     Aurelio Carboni, Stephen Lack, and R.F.C. Walters, Introduction 
     to extensive and distributive categories, J. Pure Appl. Alg. 84(1993), 
     145-158.

Here's some more stuff some of you might like, taken from

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week174.html

Again, pardon the tone - it's written for nonexperts.

If any of you know literature on the "walking biadjunction",
I'd be interested!

Best,
jb

.......................................................................

Now I'm going to dive in and pick up 
right where I left off in my discussion of the ideas behind this paper:

2) Michael Mueger, From subfactors to categories and topology I:
Frobenius algebras in and Morita equivalence of tensor categories,
available at math.CT/0111204.

My ultimate goal is to take you to an elegant understanding of
Frobenius algebras by means of a 2-category called the "walking 
biadjunction", but first I'll play around a bit with a simpler
but more famous 2-category called the "walking adjunction".  This 
may sound scary, but if you can stick with it, you'll see that I'm 
really just using these 2-categories to describe fun games that 
you can play with certain 2-dimensional pictures.   Even if you
don't read the words, please stare at the pictures - I spend my
Thanksgiving weekend drawing them, and I don't want that work to
go to waste!

Category theorists love to talk about adjoint functors, but 2-category
theorists know that these are just a special example of an "adjunction".
An adjunction is something that makes sense in any 2-category; if we
take the 2-category to be Cat we get adjoint functors.  There are lots
of other nice examples that make this generalization worthwhile.  For
example, in "week83" I explained how a pair of dual vector spaces is
also an example of an adjunction.

To study adjunctions, it suffices to study the "walking adjunction".
This is a little 2-category containing exactly the stuff any adjunction
in any 2-category must have: not a jot more, not a tiddle less!  It was
first studied by Schanuel and Street:

3) Stephen Schanuel and Ross Street, The free adjunction,
Cah. Top. Geom.  Diff. 27 (1986), 81-83.

In a bit more detail, the walking adjunction is the 2-category freely
generated by two objects:

a and b,

two morphisms:

L: a -> b  and  R: b -> a,

and two 2-morphisms, called the "unit" and "counit":

i: 1_a => LR  and  e: RL => 1_b

satisfying two relations, called the "triangle equations".  

I wrote down these equations already last week, but let me do it again
using "string diagrams", as explained in "week79" and "week92".  In a
2-categorical string diagram, objects are denoted by 2d regions in the
plane, morphisms are denoted by 1d edges, and 2-morphisms are denoted by
0d points.  If the dimensions look sort of upside-down, you're right - 
that's exactly the point!  

Instead of explaining the whole theory, I'll just plunge in with
the example at hand.  The unit i looks like this:

                     i
                    / \
                   L   R
                  /     \
              a  /   b   \  a

while the counit e looks like this:

              b  \   a   /  b 
                  R     L  
                   \   / 
                    \ /
                     e

Note that as you cross a line labelled "L" from left to right, you go
from region a to region b, which is our way of saying that L: a -> b.
Similarly, as you cross a line labelled "R" from left to right, you go
from region b to region a, since R: b -> a.  

In terms of string diagrams, the triangle equations just say that we can
straighten out a zig-zag:

                     |                     |  
           i         |                     |
          / \        L                     |
    a    /   \       |                     |
        /     \      |                     |
       |       R     /         =      a    L    b
       |        \   /                      | 
       L         \ /    b                  |
       |          e                        |
       |                                   |  

or a zag-zig:
 
         |                                  |   
         |          i                       |
         R         / \                      |
         |        /   \   a                 |
         |       /     \                    |
          \     L       |       =      b    R    a          
           \   /        |                   |
       b    \ /         R                   |
             e          |                   |
                        |                   |

We can build any 2-morphism in the walking adjunction by vertically
and horizontally composing units and counits, which corresponds to
sticking together string diagrams in a vertical or horizontal way.
Thus, a typical 2-morphism looks like this:

      \     \   a   /   \   a   /      /               |
       \     R     L     R     L      /       i        |
        \     \   /       \   /      /       / \       L
         \     \ /         \ /      /   a   /   R      |    b
          \     e           e      /       /     \     |
    a      L                      R        \      \   / 
            \         b          /     i    \      \ / 
             \                  /     / \    L      e
              \                /     L   R    \       
               \              /     /  b  \    \  

By the triangle equations, we could straighten out the zig-zag without
changing the 2-morphism.

As you may know, the word "anaranjado" means "orange" in Spanish - there
was no word in English for "orange" before people in England started
importing oranges from Spain.  And this is a nice mnemonic, because if
we take the above picture and paint the regions labelled "a" orange, and
paint the regions labelled "b" black, the above picture has a roughly
tiger-striped appearance.  In fact, these tiger stripes tell you
everything you need to know about the 2-morphism!  For example, starting
from just this:

      \     \   a   /   \   a   /      /               |
       \     \     /     \     /      /       _        |
        \     \   /       \   /      /       / \       |
         \     \_/         \_/      /   a   /   \      |    b
          \                        /       /     \     |
    a      \                      /        \      \   / 
            \         b          /     _    \      \_/ 
             \                  /     / \    \      
              \                /     /   \    \       
               \              /     /  b  \    \  

you can figure out where everything else should go.

By the way, note that orange stripes can disappear can appear as we go
down the page, and they can split, but they can't appear or merge.
Black stripes can appear or merge, but they can't disappear or split.
As a result, there can never be any orange or black *spots*.  We'll
change these rules later, when we talk about the "walking biadjunction".

Okay, so we've got this 2-category, the walking adjunction: let's call
it Ad for short.  It's pretty simple.  How can we understand it better?

Well, for any two objects a and b in a 2-category we get a
"hom-category" hom(a,b), whose objects are the morphisms from a to b,
and whose morphisms are the 2-morphisms between those.  If we work out
these hom-categories in Ad, we get some cool stuff.

First let's look at the hom-category hom(a,a).   In this category,
the objects are 

1_a, LR, LRLR, LRLRLR, ....

and all the morphisms are built by sticking these two basic
generators together vertically or horizontally:

                     \  \    a    /  /  
                      \  \       /  /
                       L  R     L  R
                        \  \   /  /
                  a      \  \ /  /      a
                          \  e  /
                           \   /
                           | b |
                           |   |
                           L   R
                           |   |
                           |   |   


and
                              i
                             / \
                     a      |   |    a
                            | b |     
                            |   |
                            L   R   
                            |   |
                            |   |

In tiger language, we're talking about pictures of black stripes on an
orange background.  The two basic generators are the merging of two
black stripes and the appearance of a black stripe.  

If you read "week89", you'll know another way to describe this!  Our
ability to stick together pictures vertically and horizontally makes
hom(a,a) into a "monoidal category".  LR is a "monoid object", with
merging of two black stripes being "multiplication", and the appearance
of a black stripe being the "multiplicative identity".  Being a "monoid
object" simply means that these operations satisfy the left unit law:


                                 / /                 | |
                                / /                  | |
                               / /                   | |
                    /\        / /                    | |
                    \ \      / /                     | |
                     \ \    / /                      | |
                      \ \  / /                  a    | |
                       \ \/ /                        |b|
                        |  /          =              | |
             a          | |                          | |      a
                        | |                          | |
                        |b|                          | |
                        | |     a                    | |
                        | |                          | |
                        | |                          | |
                        | |                          | |

and its mirror image, called the right unit law, together with the
associative law:

            \ \  a / /    / /      \ \    \ \  a / /
             \ \  / /  a / /        \ \  a \ \  / /
              \ \/ /    / /          \ \    \ \/ /
               \  /    / /            \ \    \  /
                \ \   / /              \ \   / /
                 \ \_/ /                \ \_/ /
                  \   /                  \   /
                   | |                    | |
              a    | |   a            a   | |   a
                   | |          =         | |
                   |b|                    |b|
                   | |                    | |
                   | |                    | |
                   | |                    | |
                   | |                    | |

There aren't any other laws, so hom(a,a) is the "free monoidal category
on a monoid object", or if you prefer, the "walking monoid"!   

I touched upon the immense consequences of this fact for algebraic
topology in "week117" and "week118".  They mainly rely on another way of
thinking about hom(a,a): it's the category of order-preserving maps
between finite ordinals!

For example, these black tiger stripes on an orange background:

         0          1           2                     3
    --------------------------------------------------------
   |  \     \   a |   |  a  /      /               |    |   |
   |   \     \    |   |    /      /       _        |    |   |
   |    \     \   |   |   /      /       / \       |    |   |
   |     \     \_/     \_/      /   a   /   \      |    |   |
   |      \                    /        \    \     |    |   |
   | a     \                  /          \    \   /    /    |
   |        \       b        /     _      \    \_/    /     |
   |         \              /     / \      \         /      |
   |          \            /     / b \      \   b   /   a   |
   |           \          /     /     \      \     |        |
    --------------------------------------------------------
                     0             1            2

correspond to the order-preserving map 

f: {0,1,2,3} -> {0,1,2}

with 

f(0) = 0, f(1) = 0, f(2) = 0, f(3) = 2.  

Just read the stripes down!

A more geometrical way to say the same thing is to call hom(a,a) the
category of "simplices", usually denoted Delta.   Here the object 

                         |---n+1 of them---|
                          LRLR..........LRLR

corresponds to the n-simplex, and these morphisms:

                                 -i.LRLR-->
                 --i.LR->        -LR.i.LR->
1_a  --i-->  LR  --LR.i->  LRLR  -LRLR.i-->  LRLRLR ...
                 <-L.e.R-        <-L.e.RLR-
                                 <-LRL.e.R-

are the basic "face" and "degeneracy" maps between simplices, which
you'll find in any book on algebraic topology.  The n-simplex is a face
of the (n+1)-simplex in n+1 ways, and there are n basic degenerate ways
to map the (n+1)-simplex down to the n-simplex. These aren't *all* the
morphisms; just enough to generate all the rest by composition - i.e.,
sticking together pictures vertically, but *not* horizontally.  

Perhaps I should explain the notation here a bit more.  Readers of
"week80" will know that I use a dot to denote horizontal composition of
2-morphisms.  For example, when we have a couple of 2-morphisms like
this:

                      f           f'
                  ---->----   ---->----  
                 /   ||    \ /   ||    \              S: f => g
                x    || S   y    || T   z             T: f' => g'
                 \   \/    / \   \/    /
                  ---->----   ---->----
                      g           g'

we get a 2-morphism like this:
 

                         ff'
                  -------->-------
                 /       ||       \
                x        || S.T    z                S.T: ff' => gg'
                 \       \/       /
                  -------->-------
                         gg'

But sometimes we can also horizontally compose a morphism and a
2-morphism!  We can do it whenever our morphism f looks like a little
"whisker" f sticking out of the 2-morphism T:

                                  f'
                              ---->----  
                      f      /   ||    \              
                x----->-----y    || T   z             T: f' => g'
                             \   \/    /
                              ---->----
                                  g'

and what we get is a 2-morphism f.S like this:
 

                         ff'
                  -------->-------
                 /       ||       \
                x        || f.T    z                f.T: ff' => fg'
                 \       \/       /
                  -------->-------
                         fg'


This process, called "whiskering", is not really a new operation.
f.S is really just the horizontal composite of these 2-morphisms:

                      f           f'
                  ---->----   ---->----  
                 /   ||    \ /   ||    \              
                x    ||1_f  y    || S   z             
                 \   \/    / \   \/    /
                  ---->----   ---->----
                      f           g'

Similarly we can define T.f in this sort of situation:

                      f'           
                  ---->----   
                 /   ||    \      f                   T: f' => g'
                x    || T   y----->-----z             T.f: f'f => g'f
                 \   \/    /
                  ---->---- 
                      g'     

Anyway, once you're an expert on this 2-categorical yoga, you can
easily see that these morphisms in hom(a,a), which are really 2-morphisms
in Ad:

                                 -i.LRLR-->
                 --i.LR->        -LR.i.LR->
1_a  --i-->  LR  --LR.i->  LRLR  -LRLR.i-->  LRLRLR ...
                 <-L.e.R-        <-L.e.RLR-
                                 <-LRL.e.R-

are obtained by taking our basic tiger stripe operations - the "merging
of two black stripes", or L.e.R, and the "appearance of a black stripe",
or i - and drawing some extra black stripes on both sides.  That's what
those LR's are for.  After all, no tiger is complete without whiskers!  

Okay.  Now, having understood hom(a,a) in all these ways, let's turn
to hom(b,b).  Luckily, this is very similar!  Here the objects are

1_b, RL, RLRL, RLRLRL, ....

and morphisms are pictures of *orange* stripes on a *black* background:

           \   a   /   \   a   /      /               |
            \     /     \     /      /       _        |
             \   /       \   /      /       / \       |
              \_/         \_/      /   a   /   \      |    b
                                  /       /     \     |
                                 /        \      \   / 
       b                        /     _    \      \_/ 
                               /     / \    \      
                              /     /   \    \       
                             /     /  b  \    \  

These orange stripes can only split:

                           |   |
                           |   |   
                           R   L
                           |   |
                           | a |
                           /   \                           
                          /  i  \
                  b      /  / \  \      b
                        /  /   \  \
                       R  L     R  L
                      /  /       \  \
                     /  /    b    \  \ 

or disappear:

                            |   |    
                     b      | a |     b 
                            |   |
                            R   L   
                            |   |
                            |   |
                             \ /
                              e

as we march down the page.  This means is that hom(b,b) is
Delta^{op}: the *opposite* of the category of simplices, the 
*opposite* of the category of finite ordinals, or the walking
*comonoid* - which is just like a monoid, only upside down!  

Here is another picture of hom(b,b):

                                  --R.i.LRL->
                 --R.i.L->        --RLR.i.L->
1_b  <--e--  RL  <--e.RL--  RLRL  <--e.RLRL--  RLRLRL ...
                 <--RL.e--        <--RL.e.RL-
                                  <--RLRL.e--

If you're a devoted reader of This Week's Finds, you'll know I secretly
drew this category already in section N of "week118".  There I was
talking about specific adjoint functors instead of the walking
adjunction, so as not to prematurely blow your mind.   I was also
writing horizontal composites backwards, for certain old-fashioned
reasons.  But the idea is exactly the same!  The morphisms above give
the usual "face and degeneracy maps" we always have in a simplicial set,
since a simplicial set is a functor

F: Delta^{op} -> Set.

By the way, you may have noticed that to get from hom(a,a) to hom(b,b),
we had to switch the colors orange and black AND read the pictures
upside-down.  The reason is that if we turn around all the 1-morphisms
AND 2-morphisms in the walking adjunction, we get the walking adjunction
again.  Ponder that!  

We can summarize what we've learned so far using the "Platonic idea"
jargon I introduced last week:

The Platonic idea of a monoid and the Platonic idea of a comonoid are
the hom-categories hom(a,a) and hom(b,b) sitting inside the Platonic
idea of an adjunction!

(By the way, to round this off we should really describe hom(a,b) and
hom(b,a), too.  I think hom(a,b) is the Platonic idea of "an object with
a left action of a monoid and a right coaction of a comonoid, in a
compatible way".  If so, hom(b,a) would be the Platonic idea of "an
object with a right action of a monoid and a left coaction of a comonoid, 
in a compatible way".  By "compatible" I'm saying that we can act on one
side and coact on the other side in either order, and get the same
thing.  Filling in the details requires concepts I'm not eager to
discuss right now, so I leave this as an exercise for the highly 
energetic reader.  The less energetic reader can just study the
tiger-stripe descriptions of these categories.)

Finally, here's Mueger's new twist on all these ideas!  Better than an
adjunction is a "biadjunction".  This has some extra structure, which
turns out to explain all sorts of fancy-sounding stuff people look at in
the study of subfactors and TQFTs and the like....

But what's a "biadjunction"?

A biadjunction is where you have a morphism L: a -> b in a 2-category
that is both left and right adjoint to R: b -> a.  More precisely, a
"biadjunction" is a setup 

(a,b,L,R,i,e,j,f) 

where 

(a,b,L,R,i,e) 

and

(b,a,R,L,j,f) 

are both adjunctions.  

In terms of string diagrams, our generating 2-morphisms look like this:


                  i                             j
                 / \                           / \
                L   R                         R   L
               /     \                       /     \
           a  /   b   \  a               b  /   a   \  b



           b  \   a   /  b               a  \   b   /  a
               R     L                       L     R
                \   /                         \   /
                 \ /                           \ /
                  e                             f

and the triangle equations say all possible zig-zags can be straightened
out.

Now let's study the "walking biadjunction", BiAd.   As before,
2-morphisms in BiAd can be described using pictures with orange and
black stripes - but now *both* kinds of stripes can appear, disappear,
merge or split as we march down the page:

This allows for quite arbitrary ways of cutting up a rectangle into
regions of orange and black, with piecewise linear boundaries, subject
to the condition that each vertical border has the same color all along
it.  The triangle equations and the rules for 2-categories say that we
can warp such a picture around without changing the 2-morphism that it
defines... I don't want to be too precise here, since it would be
boring.  Hopefully you get the idea: BiAd has a purely topological 
description!  

Now for the punchline: in BiAd, what is the category hom(a,a) like?
As in Ad, the objects are

1_a, LR, LRLR, LRLRLR, ...

but now the object LR is equipped not only with multiplication:

                     \  \    a    /  /  
                      \  \       /  /
                       L  R     L  R
                        \  \   /  /
                  a      \  \ /  /      a      
                          \  e  /                     multiplication:
                           \   /                     L.e.R: LRLR => LR 
                           | b |
                           |   |
                           L   R
                           |   |
                           |   |   

and multiplicative identity:

                             i
                            / \
                    a      |   |    a                 multiplicative
                           | b |                         identity:
                           |   |                        i: 1_a => LR
                           L   R   
                           |   |
                           |   |

but also a "comultiplication":
 
                           |   |
                           |   |   
                           L   R
                           |   |
                           | b |
                           /   \                           
                          /  j  \                    comultiplication:
                  a      /  / \  \      a            L.j.R: LR => LRLR
                        /  /   \  \
                       L  R     L  R
                      /  /       \  \
                     /  /    b    \  \ 


and "comultiplicative coidentity":


                            |   |    
                     a      | b |     a 
                            |   |                    comultiplicative
                            L   R                       coidentity:
                            |   |                      f: LR => 1_a
                            |   |
                             \ /
                              f

which make it into a monoid object *and* a comonoid object.  Even
better, there are some extra relations between the multiplication and
comultiplication, which make LR into a so-called "Frobenius object"!

In short, hom(a,a) is the walking Frobenius object!  So is hom(b,b),
since there is no real asymmetry between the objects a and b in a
biadjunction, as there was with an adjunction.  I haven't thought much
about hom(a,b) and hom(b,a) yet, but one obvious thing is that they're
isomorphic.

Next time I'll talk about examples of Frobenius objects and why they are
so important in subfactors, TQFTs and the like.  This is what Mueger is
really interested in.  Right now, I want to wrap up by saying exactly
what it means to say LR is a "Frobenius object".  What are the extra
relations between multiplication and comultiplication?

There are various ways of describing these relations.   Mueger uses
a pair of equations that are popular in the TQFT literature:

                                      
               \ \     / /                | |        | |
                \ \   / /                 | |        | |
                 \ \_/ /                  | |        | |
                  \   /                   |  \   a   | |
                   | |                    |   \      | |
              a    | |   a           a    | |\ \     | |   a
                   | |                    | | \ \    | |
                   |b|                    | |  \ \   | |
                   | |          =         | |   \ \  | |
                   | |                    | |    \ \ | |
                   | |                    | |  a  \ \| |
                   | |                    | |      \   |
                  / _ \                   | |       \ b|
                 / / \ \                  | |        | |
                / /   \ \                 | |        | | 
               / /     \ \                | |        | |


and its mirror image.  People sometimes call these the "I = N"
equations, for the obvious reason.  So: one definition of a "Frobenius
object" in a monoidal category is that it's a monoid object / comonoid
object satisfying the I = N equations. 

Where can you read about this?  Well, besides Mueger's paper,
there are these:

4) Frank Quinn, Lectures on axiomatic quantum field theory, in 
Geometry and Quantum Field Theory, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence,
RI, 1995.  

5) Lowell Abrams, Two-dimensional topological quantum field theories
and Frobenius algebras, J. Knot Theory and its Ramifications 5 (1996),
569-587.

The I = N equations are cute, but personally I prefer a more conceptual
description of a Frobenius object.  This may be a bit mindblowing to the
uninitiated, so if you're just barely hanging on, please stop now.

Hmm!  If you're still reading this, you must be brave!  Okay - don't
say I didn't warn you.  Let's start by pondering LR a bit more.  
This guy is its own adjoint, with the unit and counit as follows:

                      _
                a    / \      
                    |   |                     
                    |   |                      unit for LR =
                    | b |           multiplicative identity composed with
                   /  _  \                    comultiplication                
                  /  / \  \
                 /  /   \  \
                /  /  a  \  \



                \  \  a  /  /
                 \  \   /  /                 
                  \  \_/  /                   counit for LR =
                   \     /              multiplication composed with 
               a    | b |                comultiplicative coidentity
                    |   |
                    |   |
                     \_/
                

It's easy to check the triangle equations by straightening out
the relevant zig-zags.

Now, whenever a monoid object has a right or left adjoint, that right or
left adjoint automatically becomes a comonoid object, by the magic of
duality.  But if a monoid object is its *own* adjoint, it becomes a
comonoid object in *two* ways, because it is both its own left *and*
right adjoint!  So, our guy LR is a comonoid object in *three* ways!
Huh?  Well, we already knew LR was a comonoid object before this
devilish paragraph began, but since LR is its own adjoint, it becomes a
comonoid object in two other ways.  Amazingly, the I = N equations are
equivalent to the fact that all three comonoid structures agree!  I
leave this as an exercise for the insanely energetic reader... I've
worked it out before, and I rechecked it this morning in bed.  I don't 
know if a proof exists in the literature, but from what Mueger writes,
I suspect maybe you can catch glimpses of it in Appendix A3 of this book:

6) L. Kadison, New Examples of Frobenius Extensions, University 
Lecture Series #14, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence RI, 1999.

Anyway, the upshot is that we can equivalently define a Frobenius
object in a monoidal category as follows: it's a monoid object / 
comonoid object which becomes its own adjoint by letting

unit   = multiplicative identity composed with comultiplication
counit = multiplication composed with comultiplicative coidentity

and has the property that the resulting 3 comonoid structures agree.

Or, equivalently, that the resulting 3 monoid structures agree!

There is much more to say about this, but let's stop here.

Thanks!   In the next issue of This Week's Finds I'm giving a 
long introduction to the "walking adjunction", followed by a
translation of Michael Mueger's paper 

>From subfactors to categories and topology I:
Frobenius algebras in and Morita equivalence of tensor categories,
available at math.CT/0111204

into facts about the "walking biadjunction".  I knew someone
had studied the walking adjunction but didn't know the reference,
and had been meaning to ask here.

Right!  Thanks for reminding me!  I'll mention that too.

Also: has anyone here written about the "walking biadjunction"?
It's actually very interesting.

Hello,

the simplest characterization of FinSet known to me is as the free 
category with initial object and binary coproducts on one object. In 
the usual world existence of  these types of coproducts is equivalent 
to finite coproducts, but restriction to nullary and binary ones 
avoids the need for an a priori  notion of finiteness. Somehow this 
reminds me of Kuratowski's definition of finiteness.

The answer is, in general, negative: every duality, where  C  has
a terminal object, is of the above type, just take the constant functor
of value 1.

No, I don't think you get the Kuratowski finite sets that way. A set X is
Kuratowski finite iff it is in the subsemilattice (under nullary and binary
union) of PX generated by the singletons. The definition proposed looks as
though it characterizes finite ordinals, which are Kuratowski finite with a
decidable total ordering. The two are different. "Kuratowski finite"
includes sets where you can give a finite enumeration (indexed by a finite
ordinal) of the elements but can't guarantee to eliminate duplicates from
the enumeration.

The category of Kuratowski finite sets is equivalent to the ind completion
of the category of finite ordinals with surjections as the morphisms.

Intuitively initiality seems like a bigger hammer than finiteness.
This is confirmed by the observation that, although both initiality and
finiteness properly extend first order logic as a specification methodology,
initiality *guarantees* uniqueness up to whatever.  With the assumption
only of finiteness of objects, uniqueness is not so easily obtained (cf
linear orders without endpoints, an alpha-null-categorical theory).

It's like driving to work vs. riding a bicycle.  Driving is faster and more
convenient, the bicycle shifts more of the responsibility to the rider.

A nice point and I did consider writing "with binary sums and an initial
object" in place of "with finite sums" at the time.  Given the brevity of
the latter it might be preferable to consider it defined as the former by
default, indicating any exceptions explicitly.

>Somehow this reminds me of Kuratowski's definition of finiteness.

I thought Kuratowski's idea was that when a shepherd verifies that he has
only finitely many sheep by completing the process of branding them all,
it is not necessary when branding a given sheep to first check whether it
has already been branded.  All that matters (to both the shepherd and the
sheep) is that the branding eventually stop.

Here's a definition for traditionalist physicists etc. who believe that God
created the continuum while the natural numbers are the work of mankind.

** A set of points is finite just when its members can be positioned with equal
** nonzero spacing in a straight line across an A4 sheet of paper.

This is the appropriate converse to the Archimedean axiom, violated only
for those physicists who view the continuum as including infinitesimals.
Pace Joe Shipman, any physicist demonstrating this deserves a Nobel prize.

Somehow this reminds me of how many angels can fit on the head of a pin.

The walking adjunction is much older than the 1986 paper by Schanuel and
Street.  Back in 1970, Pumpl\"un published a paper: Eine Bemerkung \"uber
Monaden und adjungierte Funktoren, Math. Annalen 185 (1970), 329-377.
The small bicategory "walking adjunction" definitely was in that paper,
but I don't recall whether it was explicitly formulated or not.

are you sure everyone will be happy with the name "biadjunction"
for the thing that you're talking about?  i'm just vaguely wondering
whether it might unintentionally evoke ideas about "bicategories".

"walking ____" on the other hand is of course entirely transparent
and aptly descriptive.

=============================================================

                    FICS'2002
        Fixed Points in Computer Science

       A  Satellite Workshop to LICS'2002
  July 20--21, 2002, Copenhagen, Denmark

            http://floc02.diku.dk/FICS/

        PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS

Aim: Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer
science and logic by justifying induction and recursive definitions. The
construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated in many
different frameworks. The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for
researchers to present their results to those members of the computer
science and logic communities who study or apply the fixed point operation
in the different fields and formalisms. Previous workshops were held in
1998 in Brno, in 2000 in Paris, and in 2001 in Florence.

Topics include, but are not restricted to: Construction and reasoning
about properties of fixed points, categorical, metric and ordered fixed
point models, continuous algebras, relation algebras, fixed points in
process algebras and process calculi, regular algebras of finitary and
infinitary languages, formal power series, tree automata and tree
languages, infinite trees, the mu-calculus and other programming logics,
fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits, fixed points and the
lambda calculus, fixed points in logic programming and data bases.

Paper submission: Authors are invited to send three copies of an abstract
not exceeding three pages to the PC cochair Anna Ingolfsdottir. Electronic
submissions in the form of uuencoded postscript files are encouraged and
can be sent to annai@cs.auc.dk. Submissions are to be received before
April 15, 2002. Authors will be notified of acceptance by May 31, 2002.

Proceedings: Preliminary proceedings containing the abstracts of the talks
will be available at the meeting. Final proceedings will be published
after the meeting as a special issue of the journal Theoretical
Informatics and Application} (http://www.edpsciences.org/docinfos/ITA/).

Invited speakers: L. Aceto (Aalborg), D. Kozen (Cornell), A. Labella
(Rome), G. Winskel (Cambridge, provisional).

Program Committee: J. Adamek (Braunschweig), R. Backhouse (Nottingham), S.
Bloom (Hoboken NJ), J. Bradfield (Edinburgh), R. De Nicola (Florence), Z.
Esik (cochair, Szeged), I. Guessarian (Paris), A. Ingolfsdottir (cochair,
Aalborg), W. Kuich (Vienna), A. Labella (Rome), M. Mislove (Tulane), D.
Niwinski (Warsaw).
