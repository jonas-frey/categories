Good afternoon,

I'd like references on these two subjects:

    1. The relationship between categories and Martin-Löf types.

    2. Any attempts to develop a computer language/system in which
    categories are first class citizens.

Thanks in advance....

best
steve

I do not know whether this is what you are want, but you might consider the
IFF Category Theory Ontology -- part of the IFF Foundation Ontology that I
am developing. This is logically coded in a new version of KIF [see
http://suo.ieee.org/Kent-IFF.pdf].

The constructor calculus is a variant of the lambda-calculus typed using
a functorial type sytem. The functoriality is captured by a program (not
a given constant) 

map : forall m. forall F::m->1, X::m,Y::m. 
	P(X->Y) -> FX -> FY

where F is a functor of m arguments, X and Y are m-tuples of types, P is
the product functor and P(X->Y) represents an m-tuple of functions from
the Xs to the Ys. The calculus supports functors for lists, all sorts of
trees, vectors, matrices, trees of matrices, etc. map can be specialised
to functors of one argument to get

map1 : forall F::1->1, X,Y. (X->Y) -> FX -> FY

or to functors of two arguments to get

map2 : forall F::2->1, X0,X1,Y0,Y1. (X0->Y0) -> (X1->Y1) -> F(X0,X1) ->
F(Y0,Y1)

In a similar way one can define functor-polymorphic functions for
folding, zipping, etc.
and also for numerical operations like

plus : forall X. X -> X -> X

The essentials of the system were presented at Typed Lambda-Calculi and
Applications in May this year (Springer LNCS 2044). A more comprehensive
account is available at 
www-staff.it.uts.edu.au/~cbj/Publications/constructors.ps

Both accounts are written for an audience familiar with polymorphically
typed lambda-calculi. An account for a general audience has yet to be
written (which is why I have not already announced to this list). Let me
add that we have developed a programming language FISh2 which embodies
all of these ideas, and may soon be stable enough for public release. 


Yours,
Barry Jay

Subject: categories: charact. of absolute equalisers
Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca

Dear categorists,

I wonder whether the following result is known:

Call an equaliser in a category C *absolute* if it is preserved by all
functors. 

Proposition: An equaliser e:A->B, u,v:B->C is absolute if and only if
there are maps p:B->A, h1,h2,...hn:C->B such that 

pe=id, 
ep=h1 u
h1 u = h2 v
h2 u = h3 v
...
hn v = id

Proof: An equaliser endowed with such maps is obviously preserved by
any functor since whenever we have maps e,u,v,p,h1...hn such that
ue=ve together with the equations listed above then e equalises u and v.

For the converse consider the functor which maps X to C(B,X)/~ where ~
is the left congruence generated by u~v, i.e., f~g iff there are h1...hn
such that f=h1 u h1 v = h2 u ...  hn v = g

If this functor preserves the equaliser then, since Fu([id]) =
Fv([id]) we obtain p:B->A such that ep~id. Thus we have maps h1..hn
with the desired properties. To show pe=id we calculate as follows:
epe=h1 u e = h1 v e = h2 u e = ... = hn v e = e, so pe=id since e is a
mono.

Best wishes, 
 Martin Hofmann

Dear Martin,

These were studied in my PhD thesis "Absoluteness Properties in Category Theory"
McGill 1969. See "Absolute Coequalizers" Springer Lecture Notes 86 (1969), 
132-145, and "On Absolute Colimits" J. Alg. 19 (1971) 80-95.

The proof I give shows that for colimits it is sufficient to test
preservation by the Yoneda functor (or all representables). So while the
Yoneda embedding preserves all limits, it preserves no colimits execpt
those it absolutely has to.

It's interesting that you came up with the same name for them.

Bob Pare's answer fully answers the immediate question. Please allow 
me to add mention of a little observation on absolute colimits (not 
just coequalizers) in the context of enriched categories which 
appears as:

Absolute colimits in enriched categories, Cahiers topologie et 
géométrie différentielle 24 (1983) 377- 379; MR85i:18001.

It is a good opportunity for me to push the notion of weighted (or 
indexed) limit; see Francis Borceux's books (p. 327 of Book II) and 
G. Max Kelly's book (almost the central notion!).  Absoluteness is 
nicely expressible in terms of the weight.

Lectureship, Edinburgh University, Division of Informatics

We seek to appoint a Lecturer to contribute either to our 
research in semantics of computation or to our research in 
automatic verification of finite and infinite state systems, 
both broadly construed. Possible areas of research interest 
in semantics include core formalisms for computation and 
programming language semantics, categorical and logical models, 
type theory as well as newer perspectives such as formalisms 
for global and mobile computation. Possible areas of research 
in  verification include automata theory, algorithms, computational 
logic, abstract interpretation, constraint programming and 
we especially  welcome applicants whose contribution has also 
been experimental, involving  case studies. 

The successful candidate will work in the Laboratory for 
Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS).

For application details see

                   MATHEMATICS OF PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION
                   -----------------------------------

                  http://www.cs.ukc.ac.uk/conf/mpc2002/
            
                  Organised in conjunction with WCGP '02

                            8--10 July, 2002

                            Dagstuhl, Germany


                             CALL FOR PAPERS


This conference aims to promote the development of mathematical
principles and techniques that are demonstrably useful and usable
in the process of constructing computer programs (whether
implemented in hardware or software).
The focus of the conference is on techniques that combine
precision with conciseness, enabling programs to be constructed by
formal calculation.  Within this theme, the scope of the conference
is very diverse.  We welcome contributions to  programming
methodology (for example, formal methods for program specification
and transformation), to programming paradigms (for example,
generic programming techniques and type systems) and to language
design (for example, programming calculi and programming language
semantics).  Theoretical contributions are welcome provided their
relevance to program construction is evident; discussion of
applications is welcome provided the mathematical basis is evident.

The conference will be organised in conjunction with the IFIP TC2
Working Conference on Generic Programming, WCGP '02. There will also be
a number of co-located workshops, including CMPP.


                            IMPORTANT DATES

Deadline for submission of papers:    6th January, 2002
Notification of acceptance/rejection: 4th March, 2002
Final papers due:                     25th April, 2002

Hello,

    First of all sorry for the beginner's question. I
have been reading various sources about the notion
of a subobject classifier, e.g. McClarty's book, 
Lawvevre's book. Let assume the following situation: 


1) Has a subobject classifier, 
       true : 1 ---------> Omega.

2) Have an object X and object A and
     a monomorphism subX: A------->X.

3) With 2), we will have the pullback diagram
     with the corners of the pullback
     being the subobject classifier
     and the unqiue classifier/classifier
X------>Omega

4)We have either a element, el: 1------>X or a 
     generalized el: element H------->X.


Question: Let's assume for simplicity that our
category
   is Set. The problem is I don't understand how the
   notion of a subobject classifier determines whether
   "el" does or does not belong to the aforementioned
   subobject, "subX"! (I know that the outer commuting
   square figures in this, but it seems like every
   element will be "classified" as belonging 
   to "subX").


Thanks and regards, Bill Halchin

        U ----------> 1
        V  _|         |
        |             | true
        |             |
        V   chi       V
        X --------> Omega

If any element "belongs to U" in the arrows sense that it factors
through U, ie there is a map from 1 (or somewhere) to U, then the
composite with chi:X->Omega is equal to (the composite with) true.

Conversely, if an element of X "belongs to U" in the logical sense
that its composite with chi is equal to (the composite with)true, then
we have a commutative square that can be compared to the pullback.


For more about the logical consequences of this property of Omega,
and in particular the mysterious formula
      a & F(a)  =  a & F(true)
see "Geometric and Higher Order Logic ..." in TAC, v7 (2000) pp 284--338.

For a presentation of set theory (or, as I call it, Zermelo type theory)
in a form that is both the way that ordinary mathematicians use it,
and directly related to the topos-theoretic way of saying things,
see Section 2.2 of my book "Practical Foundations of Mathematics".

The direct answer to Bill Halchin's concern (`it seems like every
element will be "classified" as belonging to "subX"') is that this is
the defining characteristic of subX: subX consists of those elements
of X that belong to subX.  That is, every element of subX has to be
classified as belonging to subX.

The triviality of this answer suggests that Bill's real question is,
how does the pullback

        f
    Y ----> X
    |       |
   !|       |g
    |       |
    v   z   v
    1 ----> Z

in the definition of topos work in the case of sets?  Here's one answer.

The basic idea is that there are two equally good ways of defining a
subset of a set X, in terms of functions respectively to and from X.

TO: A function f:Y->X has an image f(Y), a subset of X.

FROM: A function g:X->Z has an inverse image g^-1({z}) of any given
element z of Z, also a subset of X.

Every subset of X arises in both ways (provided in the latter case that Z
has at least two elements).  With a little care it can be made to arise
in a canonical way in both cases, and moreover such that these two ways
are paired up according to the subset they each determine.

TO:  Now there are many functions to X with the same image.  However any
two _injections_ i:Y->X, i':Y'->X have the same image if and only if
there is a bijection j:Y->Y' for which the evident triangle commutes,
namely i'j = i.  Call two such injections isomorphic.  The isomorphism
classes of injections to X are then in bijection with the subsets of X.

FROM:  Even if we hold Z and an element z thereof fixed there may
still be many functions g:X->Z with the same inverse image g^-1({z}).
This happens for |Z| >= 3, where two g's can agree on the members of
a subset yet disagree about which of the non-z elements of Z to send
the nonmembers to.  On the other side, if Z is a singleton we lose the
proper subsets of X, and if Z is empty we lose all subsets.

We are now in a position to analyze the subobject classifier condition,
which can be stated for sets as follows.

    For every injection i:Y->X there exists a unique g:X->Z making the
    above square a pullback.

Existence and uniqueness each appear twice in this condition, once
explicitly, and once implicitly in the notion of pullback.

For the former, the existence requirement ensures that Z has enough
elements to permit it to classify at all, while uniqueness prevents it
from having too many, avoiding ``overclassification.''  Thus |Z|=2 is
the only possible choice for a subobject classifier, i.e. Z (along with
its element z) is determined up to isomorphism.

For the latter, the uniqueness requirement in the definition of pullback
ensures that i is an injection, and existence makes it the the maximal
injection into X for which g(i(y)) = z for all y in Y.  Note furthermore
that g uniquely determines i up to isomorphism, i.e. the property of
being a pullback ensures that for each g there exists a unique i up to
isomorphism, giving us the other direction of our desired bijection.

Although everything said above has been for Set, it can be lifted (with
the necessary care) to any cartesian closed category with the obvious
generalizations of set to object, function to morphism, injection to
monic, and element to morphism-from-1.

What does not lift are properties of the topos Set not common to all
toposes, such as that Set has a natural numbers object {0,1,2,...},
and is a Boolean topos (the logic of set membership is Boolean).

An example of a topos with no natural numbers object is furnished by
the subtopos of Set consisting just of its finite sets.  The argument
that Set is a topos shows with almost no modification (and in particular
with the same subobject classifier) that this evidently cartesian closed
subcategory is itself a topos.

An example of a non-Boolean topos is furnished by the cartesian closed
category of directed graphs made a topos by taking Z to be the 2-clique
(two vertices and four edges) with one of its self-loops duplicated
and the duplicate taken as z (the elements of a directed graph being
its self-loops).  A CCC can be made a topos in at most one way up to
isomorphism of its subobject classifier, so (given that this choice
works), this strange graph is it for this topos.

One quick way to see that this is a topos is to present it as the
presheaf category Set^C where C is the category E=>V with two objects
E,V and two morphisms s,t:E->V.  A graph is a functor from C to Set;
it assigns sets to E and V (respectively the set of edges and the set of
vertices), and functions to s and t, respectively the source and target
functions specifying the two vertices the edges run between.  The relevant
theorem here is that the functor category Set^C is a topos for any small
category C.  For C = E=>V the theorem automatically constructs the above
strange graph.

Hypothesis: the sum of an m-pointed set and an
n-pointed set is an m+n-pointed set.

Is this true?  I've not thought of a counterexample.

If this is a theorem, can anyone tell me where to find 
a proof.  Such a proof, presented by a professional 
mathematician, would be interesting and instructive.

                            PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS
        -----------------------------------------------------------------


                        2nd IFIP International Conference on

                          THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE

                                          (TCS 2002)

                           Montreal, August 25-30, 2002


                     co-sponsored by  EATCS and ACM Sigact





-----------------------------------------------------------------
Special Focus:

    Foundations of IT in the Era of Network and Mobile Computing
    -------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, IT application scenarios have evolved in very innovative
ways. Highly distributed networks have now become a common platform
for large-scale distributed programming, high bandwidth communications
are cheap and widespread, and most of our work tools are equipped with
processors enabling us to perform a multitude of tasks. In addition, mobile
computing (referring not only to wireless devices and dynamically
configured systems, but also and especially to mobile agents and robots)
has made it possible to exploit interaction in novel ways.

To harness the flexibility and power of these rapidly  evolving, interactive
systems, we need to come up with radically new foundational ideas and
principles. Now is the time to develop the theoretical foundations required
to design these systems.

Our computational goal is to discover techniques, models and algorithms
allowing us to construct systems that are flexible, dependable, secure,
robust and efficient. The prime focus is how to control and coordinate the
entities in the system. Cost and performance measures must account for
the integration of communication and computing, as well as the natural
interplay between structural information and complexity.

In terms of programming paradigms, mechanisms are required to support
mobility of code and computations, as well as effective infrastructures
to support coordination and control of dynamically loaded software modules.
Furthermore, a semantic and logic framework to formalize Internet
computations is clearly required as well. Crucial issues in the development
of Internet applications involve the control of component interactions,
since some components can be dynamically downloaded from the network.
Security architectures an monitor the execution of mobile code to protect
a host from external attacks on private information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Original and significant contributions on these issues, as well on foundational
questions are sought from all areas of theoretical computer science.

TCS 2002 will be composed of two interrelated tracks:

Track 1 -  Algorithms, Complexity and Models of Computation

Track 2  -  Logic, Semantics, Specification and Verification.


A submission should include the track name, the title of the paper, names and
affiliations of authors, an abstract up to 300 words, and the contact author's
name, address, phone number, fax number, and email address. The submission
must be in English, and it should provide a summary of the main results and
their details to allow the program committee to assess their merits and
significance, including references and comparisons. The result of the
paper must
be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including
journals and the proceedings of other symposia or workshops. One author
of each accepted paper should be able to present it at the conference.
The Proceedings will be published by Kluwer, the official publisher of
IFIP.
More details on the submission procedure will appear in the forthcoming
First CFP and on the Confrence web site.


Important Dates:

December 3, 2001: Deadline for submission of papers

Objectives
==========

Object-based Distributed Computing is being established as the most
pertinent basis for the support of large, heterogeneous computing and
telecommunication systems. Indeed, several important international
organisations, such as ITU, ISO, OMG, TINA-C, etc. are defining
similar distributed object-based frameworks as a foundation for open
distributed computing.

The advent of Open Object-based Distributed Systems - OODS - brings
new challenges and opportunities for the use and development of formal
methods.  New architectures and system models are emerging (e.g., the
enterprise, information, computational and engineering viewpoints of
the ITU-T/ISO/IEC ODP Reference Model) which require formal notational
support. Usual design issues such as specification, verification,
refinement, and testing need to take into account new dimensions
introduced by distribution and openness, such as quality of service
and dependability constraints, dynamic binding and reconfiguration,
consistency between multiple models and viewpoints, security etc. OODS
is a challenging research context and a source of motivation for
semantical models of object-based systems and notations, for the
evolution of standardised formal description techniques, for the
application and assessment of logic based approaches, for better
understanding and information modeling of business requirements, and
for the further development and use of Object Oriented methodologies
and tools.

The objective of FMOODS is to provide an integrated forum for the
presentation of research in several related fields, and the exchange
of ideas and experiences in the topics concerned with the formal
methods support for Open Object-based Distributed Systems.

What is the definition/scope of the term "catamorphism"?

In the calculational school of programming, I think people agree that:

  For every F-algebra A, the unique F-homomorphism from an initial F-algebra to
  A is a catamorphism.

but:

  Is the converse true also, or is `catamorphism' more general: "a
  catamorphism is the unique arrow from an initial _object_ (in any category,
  not just categories of algebras)." I think the answer to that question is
  no, but is there a snappy name for such arrows?

  What about the universal arrows in the free algebra construction? Are those
  `catamorphisms' or not? If not, is there a name for those arrows?

and furthermore:

  In the case of initial F-algebras, for F an endofunctor on category C, is the
  catamorphism the arrow in the category of F-algebras, or the corresponding
  one in C? In other words, is `catamorphism' a property of the arrow or the
  arrow + the category? If you compare with `monomorphism', since we speak of
  being `monic _in_ C', I presume the latter, and thus only one arrow would be
  `catamorphic', but which? Judging from the literature, I am inclined to
  say that the arrow in C is the catamorphism, but I would like a second
  opinion.

Erik Meijer coined the name "catamorphism". According to
him, the name was chosen because the Greek prefix "cata"
means "downwards"; a catamorphism destructs a data structure
like a list. (For example, "sum" destructs a list of
numbers, yielding a number.)

So I would agree with you. For example, in Set, the unique
arrow from the initial object (the empty set) to any other
object does not "destruct", so should not be called a
catamorphism.

It is the arrow in C. In programming terms, it is the
program itself (eg "sum") that destructs; the arrow in the
category of F-algebras is merely an artifact of the
categorical way of modelling such programs.

IMHO.

=========================================================================

Mathematical Knowledge Management is an exciting new field in the
intersection of mathematics and computer science.

We need efficient, new techniques  -  based  on  sophisticated  formal
mathematics and software technology - for taking fruit of the enormous
knowledge available in current mathematical sources and for organizing
mathematical knowledge in a new way.

The Workshop  should  bring  together  math researchers,  software
developers, publishing companies,  librarians, math societies, and
teachers for exchanging their views and approaches and for pushing 
the field.

Whereas the workshop is designed to provide a forum for discussion
and  presentation of early ideas, the special issue is a forum for
polished,  refereed papers in the area  of  mathematical knowledge
management.  Participation and presentation of talks and papers is
possible in both the workshop  and  the special issue,  jointly or
independently.

To supplement Vaughn Pratt's excellent account of the subobject classifier 
in the topos of directed graphs, it may help to make explicit the following: 
The truth object merely represents (i.e., concentrates) a notion which 
applies in any category. Given two maps x and y with the same codomain, x 
BELONGS TO y iff the Steenrod lifting problem has a solution  (Exist z) x=yz. 
If y is monic, then of course there is at most one "proof" z of such a 
belonging relation. Further specializing, if x is also monic, the relation 
in question is usually called "inclusion of parts" ; specializing in another 
direction, if the domain of x is a favorite element-kind in the particular 
category (such as a generic arrow or generic dot in the case of graphs, or the 
terminal object 1), then it is called "membership". Note that pioneers such 
as Dedekind and Banach did NOT need to distinguish notationally between 
these special cases (in contrast to the Peano tradition which seems to have 
brought more confusion than clarification).
The dual Steenrod division problem, which he called "extension", is equally 
important in mathematical practice; existentially quantifying it we obtain 
a "delta" relation dual to the epsilon relation:
f IS DETERMINED BY g iff there exists (a procedure) p so that f=pg.
Again if g is epic there can be at most one p, and of interest is the case 
where the codomain of f is restricted to a favorite "type"(=space of values 
for functions).
Question: Are there useful categories wherein this determination relation is 
concentrated in one object as the belonging relation is for toposes?

The meaning of "sum" as coproduct depends on the specification of the
ambient category. If we are dealing with multi-pointed sets as suggested ,
the following would seem reasonable :

An m-pointing of a set X is an arbitrary map from m (as a set) to X, and a
morphism of such is a pair consisting of a map m to m' and a map X to X'
such that the equation expressed by the obvious square holds. In the
category thus defined, it is easily verified that your construction indeed
has the universal mapping property of coproduct.

If we were to restrict m to be finite, but X arbitrary, the above
discussion still applies, except that the category&nbsp; would not be
closed under the map-space&nbsp;construction although it does have a
truth-value object . On the other hand, if we restrict X to be finite but
leave m unrestricted, we obtain a category satisfying both of these topos
axioms, yet not definable over sets nor indeed over any Boolean base
topos, as Bob Pare showed some years ago.

                         GENERAL INFORMATION

TACS2001 will be held on the campus of Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.
The invited talks and contributed talks will be presented at the Aoba
Memorial Building, Faculty of Engineering located on the Aoba Hill about
3 km west of downtown Sendai. The welcome reception and banquet will be
held at Sendai Tokyu Hotel, located in downtown Sendai.
The TACS2001 proceedings will be available as a volume of Lecture Notes
in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, at the time of the conference.

Sendai is the largest city in the northern part of Honshu Island of Japan,
with a population of about a million. The city is known in Japan as the
"City of Trees". It is 350 km north of Tokyo and about 2 hours away by
the Tohoku Bullet Train (Tohoku Shinkansen). Sendai is a modern, safe city
with a moderate climate blessed by four distinct seansons. At the end of
October the weather would be mostly sunny with temperature ranging from
5 C (41 F) to 15 C (59 F), and it will be the time of beautiful autumnal 
tints.

Conference registration is open to the public. Reservations for the Japanese
dinner party (October 31st) will be limited.
Register and make reservations by returning the completed form by email and
fax. The registration form is attached below, and it is also available from
the TACS2001 web site.
There will also be on-site registration at:
  * Sendai Tokyu Hotel, 16:00 - 21:00, October 28,
  * Aoba Memorial Bldg, Tohoku Univ, 9:00 - 17:00 on October 29-31.

Some information on transportation and hotels is described below. More
information on TACS2001, including travel information, is available at
the TACS2001 web page:

         http://tacs2001.ito.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/tacs2001/

Transportation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Conference participants arriving at the new Tokyo International (Narita)
Airport are advised to take the JR Narita Express train from Narita
Airport to Tokyo Station. Then take the Yamabiko super express train of
Tohoku Shinkansen (Tohoku Bullet Train) from Tokyo to Sendai. Making
reservation at Narita Station for the Yamabiko is strongly recommended.
Those arriving at the new Osaka International (Kansai) Airport can fly
to Sendai Airport, and take Limousine Bus service to Sendai Station.
Alternatively, you can take a local train from the Kansai Airport to
JR Shin Osaka Station, then take the Tokaido Shinkansen from JR Shin
Osaka Station to JR Tokyo Station and change at Tokyo Station to Tohoku
Shinkansen.
Some details on transportation will be available at the TACS2001 web page.
Note: 
(1) No flight service is available from Narita to Sendai Airport, since 
    the train service is superior. There is another train service from
    Narita Airport to downtown Tokyo (Ueno) by Skyliner of the Keisei-Narita 
    Line. At Ueno you can take the Yamabiko superexpress of Tohoku Shinkansen
    to Sendai, but you have to walk about 10 min from Keisei Ueno Station to
    JR Ueno Station to take Tohoku Shinkansen.
(2) If you are going to travel in Japan by JR lines before/after the 
    TACS2001 symposium, it will be convenient and economical to get a 
    JR PASS before your departure. Contact your travel agent for more 
    information on JR PASS (Japan Rail Pass).

Hotels
^^^^^^
Two hotels offer discount rates to TACS2001 participants: the Sendai Tokyu
Hotel, and the Sendai Washington Hotel. They are 1.2 km west of Sendai
Station and about 800 Yen by taxi from the station. Two hotels are located 
within 5 min walk of each other.

More information on TACS2001 is available at the TACS2001 web page.

While the topic of topos subobject classifier is current,
how far back can the historical and conceptual origins
of the use of "$\Omega$" as the symbol denoting such be traced?

What is a good source for the category of modules over a ring object in a
Grothendieck topos?  I am particularly interested in the question: if I is
an injective module and E is an object of the topos, then there is an
exponential I^E.  Is it injective?  Equivalently, are internal copowers
left exact?

If a topos E is a generalized topological space, then Omega is the internal
version of its (ungeneralized) topology, its lattice of opens: for the
global elements 1 -> Omega are in bijection with the continuous maps
[geometric morphisms] from E to [sheaves over] Sierpinski space. (This
extends to generalized elements too. Suppose U is an object of E, a sheaf
over E, and let U' -> E be the corresponding local homeomorphism. Then the
morphisms U -> Omega correspond with the opens of U'.) Hence Omega can be
read as an abbreviation for Open.

Is this how the notation actually arose, or is it just a pleasant
rationalization of my own?

If X is an ordinary topological space, then Omega X is one notation used
for its topology. But though I use it myself, I don't know anything about
its history.

Putting these together you see that when you take E as your base category
of sets then Omega 1, the topology of the 1-point space, is just Omega.

\begin{document}

When I created diagxy I did not set out to make diagrams that were
better than those of xy-pic, but only to make a simpler and more
familiar (to users of my diagram macros) interface.  Since it is based
entirely on xy-pic, it is not possible in any case.  But then there are
defaults\ldots.  A colleague asked me to look at a paper to help him
choose a referee and I came on the following display:
$$\xymatrix    {
 X_{rs}\ar[rr]^{\Upsilon_{(rs,\tau)}}&&
X_{^\tau(rs)}\ar[rr]^{\Upsilon_{(^\tau(rs),
\sigma)}}&&X_{^{\sigma\tau}(rs)}   }
$$
 I don't know that the above code is the exact code the authors used,
but the results are identical.  I call your attention to the varying
heights of the three $X$'s. For an extreme example of this, consider
 $$\bfig
 \xymatrix{X^\Gamma\ar[r]&x_\gamma}
 \efig$$
 This happens because xymatrix centers the arrow on the middle of the
node.  I do not know if xymatrix can be told to do otherwise, but the
underlying xy-pic code certainly can be and that was the default I chose
in designing my morphism macro.  Look at
 $$\bfig
 \morphism<900,0>[X_{rs}`X_{^\tau(rs)};{\Upsilon_{(rs,\tau)}}]
 \morphism(900,0)<900,0>[X_{^\tau(rs)}`X_{^{\sigma\tau}(rs)};
{\Upsilon_{(^\tau(rs),\sigma)}}]
 \efig$$
 by contrast.  The morphism code actually raises the arrow by a fixed
amount (some fraction of the xheight, a font-dependent quantity) above
the baseline, which is independent of descenders, ascenders, and sub-
and superscripts.  Actually, I would have done this with online to,
which uses xy-pic only for the arrows, not the nodes and adjusts the
lengths of the arrows to fit the labels:
$$X_{rs}\to^{\Upsilon_{(rs,\tau)}}X_{^\tau(rs)}\to^{\Upsilon_{(^\tau(rs),
\sigma)}}X_{^{\sigma\tau}(rs)}$$

This is not intended as a criticism of xy-pic.  It is very general and
it would be easy to find examples in which their default was what is
wanted.  It is just not likely to be in commutative diagrams.  They do
give the option of placing the arrow with respect to the baseline, which
is more than Latex' picture mode does.  My old macros were based on
that.  I now think it may be possible to coerce the picture mode into
using the baseline (by putting things into boxes and defining them to
have depth 0, if you want the details), but I knew much less 15 years
ago when I started using Latex.  So I used a different, much less
satisfactory, approach that sort of worked but caused other problems and
required extensive use of phantom arguments.
