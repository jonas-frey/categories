Oops! I guess I fell into this trap. If biadjunction doesn't mean 
bicategorical adjunction what does it mean? (I mentioned the free-living 
pseudoadjunction since I thought it did.)

On the "walking adjunction"

I don't know the Pumplun's paper cited by Wyler. But there is another
reference at about the same time; indeed, the "walking adjunction" has been
explicitly constructed and studied in the paper of Auderset:
         "Adjonction et monade au niveau des 2-cat=E9gories"
published in "Cahiers de Top. et Geom. Diff." XV-1 (1974), 3-20.

More formally it could also be called "the 2-sketch of an adjunction" in
the terminology in my paper with Charles Ehresmann:
"Categories of sketched structures", in the "Cahiers" XIII-2 (1972),
reprinted in
"Charles Ehresmann: Oeuvres completes et commentees" Part IV-2.

To add a remark on the terminology: When Charles introduced the concept of
a sketch (already in a Kansas report of1966,  cf. "Oeuvres"  Parts III-2
and IV-1), the aim was to define the 'Platonist idea' of a structure, not
only of a purely algebraic one, but also of structures like categories
(partially defined operations), fields, or even topologies. He thought
first of calling a sketch an idea, but then reserved the word "idea" for
the smallest part which helps reconstruct the sketch; for instance for a
category, the arrows which 'represent' the domain and codomain maps and the
composition law.
                         Sincerely

ONE MORE HISTORICAL CITATION
    The Pumplun paper cited by Wyler as well as the Auderset paper cited
by Mme Ehresmann illustrate that the study of generic structures in
2-categories has been going on for some time.  My own paper
ORDINAL SUMS AND EQUATIONAL DOCTRINES, SLNM 80 (1969) 141-155
shows that the augmented simplicial category Delta serves as the generic
monad, but moreover goes on to actually apply this to show that the
Kleisli construction is a tensor product left-adjoint to the Eilenberg-
Moore construction which is an enriched Hom. The Hom/tensor formalism
appropriate to the case of strict monoid objects is all that is required
here, as I will explain below.

AN EXTENSION AND A RESTRICTION
    The important special case of FROBENIUS monads is explicitly
characterized in three ways in my paper.
    Concerning the IDEMPOTENT case discussed a few days ago by Grandis
and Johnstone, note that the publication of Schanuel and Street proves
among other things that the monoid Delta in Cat has very few quotients
(see below for significance of the monoid structure).


THE GENERAL HOM/TENSOR FORMALISM AND A VERY PARTICULAR MONOID
    In any cartesian-closed category with finite limits and co-limits, a
non-linear version of the Cartan-Eilenberg Hom/tensor formalism applies
to actions and biactions of monoid objects.  In Cat, Delta is a (strict)
monoid and its actions are precisely monads on arbitrary categories.  A
crucial part of the formalism is that categories of actions are
automatically enriched in the basic cartesian-closed category, which in
this case is Cat.  There is a particular biaction of Delta, which I called
Delta plus, with the property that the enriched Hom of it into an
arbitrary Delta-action is exactly the Eilenberg-Moore category of
"algebras", automatically equipped with its structure as a Delta^op action
(co-monad).  The left-adjoint tensor assigns to any category equipped with
a co-monad its Kleisli category, as a category with monad.  Not only are
the calculations in this particular case quite explicit, but the enriched
Hom tensor formalism has a lot of content which is still under-exploited.

SKETCHES VERSUS PLATONISM
     The often repeated slander that mathematicians think "as if" they
were "platonists" needs to be combatted rather than swallowed. What
mathematicians and other scientists use is the objectively developed human
instrument of general concepts. (The plan to misleadingly use that fact as
a support for philosophical idealism may have been an honest mistake by
Plato, or it may have been part of his job as disinformation officer for
the Athenian CIA organization; it probably would not have survived until
now had it not been for the special efforts of Cosimo de' Medici.)
It seems that a general concept has two related aspects, as I began to
realize more explicitly in connection with my paper Adjointness in
foundations, Dialectica vol. 23, 1969 281-296;  I later learned that
some philosophers refer to these two aspects as
"abstract general vs. concrete general".  For example, there is the
algebraic theory of rings  vs. the category of all rings, or
a particular abstract group  vs. the category of all permutation
representations of the group.  While it is "obvious" that, at least in
mathematics, a concrete general should have the structure of a category,
because all the instances embody the same abstract general and hence
any two instances can be compared in preferred ways, by contrast it was
not until the late fifties that one realized that an abstract general can
also be construed as a category in its own right. That realization
essentially made explicit the fact that substitution is a logical
operation and indeed is the most fundamental logical operation.

     Thus an abstract general is essentially a special algebraic structure
indeed a category with additional structure such as finite limits or
still richer doctrines.  As with other algebraic structures there are
again two aspects, the structures themselves and their presentations which
are closely related, yet quite distinct;  for example, more than one
presentation may be needed for efficient calculations determining features
of the same algebraic structure. What is meant by a presentation depends 
on the doctrine: for example Delta as a mere category has an infinite
presentation used in topology, but as a strict monoidal category it has
a finite presentation.

     The notion of SKETCH is the most efficient scheme yet devised for the
general construction of PRESENTATIONS OF ABSTRACT GENERALS. The fact that
particular abstract generals and the idea of sketches exist within the
historically developed objective science does not mean that they somehow
always existed; to call them "platonic" seems to detract from the honor of
their actual discoverers.

There could be multiple ideas that generate the same sketch;
how do we decide which is the correct idea among equivalent ones?
OTOH, if we take equivalence classes of ideas, then we're taking sketches.
For example, one could define the idea of multiplication in a monoid
as a binary operation and a nullary operation
or alternatively as an operation on finite tuples.
The former is more common, but I prefer the latter;
who has the right idea?

Dear Colleagues:

We are pleased to announce that a

"Workshop on Categorical Structures for Descent and Galois Theory,
            Hopf Algebras and Semiabelian Categories"

will be held September 23-28, 2002, at the Fields Institute in Toronto.

For a general description of the theme of the Workshop, see below.

A second and more detailed announcement will be sent in January 2002. It
will contain a list of invited talks as well as an invitation for a
limited number of contributed talks. There is also a webpage about the
Workshop at

http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/02-03/galois_and_hopf/

We hope to be able to welcome you at the Workshop.

                  ESSLLI-2002 STUDENT SESSION

                     FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

                August 5-16 2002, Trento, Italy

                  Deadline: February 25th, 2002

	  www.iccs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/~malvi/esslli02


We are pleased to announce the Student Session of the 14th European
Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI-2002)
organised by the Centre for scientific and technological research
(ITC-irst) in Trento and by the University of Trento, under the
auspices of the European Association for Logic, Language and
Information (FoLLI). ESSLLI-2002 will be held in Trento from August
5-16 2002. We invite submission of papers for presentation at the
ESSLLI-2002 Student Session and for appearance in the proceedings.


PURPOSE:
This seventh ESSLLI Student Session will provide, like the other
editions, an opportunity for ESSLLI participants who are students to
present their own work in progress and get feedback from senior
researchers and fellow-students.  The ESSLLI Student Session
encourages submissions from students at any level, from undergraduates
(before completion of the Master Thesis) as well as postgraduates
(before completion of the PhD degree). Papers co-authored by
non-students will not be accepted.  Papers may be accepted for full
presentation (30 minutes including 10 minutes of discussion) or for a
poster presentation.  All the accepted papers will be published in the
ESSLLI-2002 Student Session proceedings, which will be made available
during the summer school.


KLUWER BEST PAPER AWARD: As in previous years, the best paper will be
selected by the programme committee and will be offered a prize by
Kluwer Academic Publishers to be spent on books.


REQUIREMENTS: 
The Student Session papers should describe original, unpublished work,
completed or in progress that demonstrates insight, creativity, and
promise. No previously published papers should be submitted.  Note
that the ESSLLI02 school will be focussed on the three main
interdisciplinary areas (Logic & Language, Logic & Computation, and
Language & Computation), while the single areas have been
dropped. Given the high interest shown over the years, the Student
Session will keep two of the single areas, namely Logic and Language,
welcoming thus submissions within the following topics: Logic,
Language, Logic & Language, Logic & Computation, Language &
Computation.


FORMAT OF SUBMISSION: 
Student authors should submit an anonymous full paper headed by the
paper title, not to exceed 7 pages of length exclusive of references
and send a separate identification page (see below). Note that the
length of the final version of the accepted papers will not be allowed
to exceed 10 pages. Since reviewing will be blind, the body of the
abstract should omit author names and addresses. Furthermore,
self-references that reveal the author's identity (e.g., "We
previously showed (Smith, 1991)... ") should be avoided. It is
possible to use instead references like "Smith (1991) previously
showed...".  For any submission, a plain ASCII text version of the
identification page should be sent separately, using the following
format:

Title: title of the submission 
First author: firstname lastname
Address: address of the first author 
...... 
Last author: firstname lastname 
Address: address of the last author 
Short summary: abstract (5 lines) 
Subject area (one of): Logic | Language | Logic and
Language | Logic and Computation | Language and Computation

If necessary, the program committee may reassign papers to a more
appropriate subject area. The submission of the extended abstract
should be in one of the following formats: PostScript, PDF, RTF, or
plain text. But note that, in case of acceptance, the final version of
the paper has to be submitted in LaTeX format. Please, use A4 size
pages, 11pt or 12pt fonts, and standard margins. Submissions outside
the specified length and formatting requirements may be subject to
rejection without review.

The paper and separate identification page must be sent by
e-mail to:

       malvi@cogsci.ed.ac.uk   by FEBRUARY 25th 2002

I'm confused: in my understanding, a sketch basically amounts to
a way of giving generators and relations for a category with products, 
Different sketches give the same category with products, not vice versa.  
Your example gives two sketches, but one category with products.  In
this sense, a sketch is more like an "idea" than you seem to be giving
it credit for.

By the way, in response to Lawvere's comments:

My use of the term "Platonic idea of X" for the free 
category/category with products/monoidal category/2-category/whatever 
on an X was not meant as an endorsement of "Platonism" in the philosophy
of mathematics - especially since "Platonism" means many things to
many people.  It was also not meant to suggest that Plato had this idea.
It was basically meant to get people thinking about abstract generals
versus concrete particulars.

Best,
John Baez

There are a number of definitions of sketch around, some of which require
it to be a category with finite products.  In one of Ehresmann's (and
Bastiani's, I believe) there is mentioned the possibility of its being
what they called a quasicategory (or some such substructure term) in which
composition is a partly defined multi-ary operation (in other words, fgh
could be defined without fg or gh being defined).  Charles and I realized
that this was equivalent to what we called a graph with diagrams, which
seemed a more useable notion.  So what we called a sketch was a graph with
diagrams as well as certain cones and cocones that were singled out to be
taken to limits and colimits, resp.  Peter Johnstone criticized us for
doing the equivalent of replacing groups by generators and relations,
which is correct, but it was a conscious decision and there were reasons
for it.  I had never heard the term "idea" in this connection or we might
have used it.  But anyway, "sketch" is used in different ways and I guess
Charles and I contributed to this, but didn't create it.

An interesting question in itself.  I don't think either idea is "right", but
I (presumably) share with you the feeling that often the latter is more
appropriate.  However, if you resolve wholeheartedly never to use a binary +
nullary presentation of a monoid-like structure then you actually find
yourself in quite an extreme position.  For instance, a monoid would be
defined as a set M together with an n-fold operation

(m_1, ..., m_n) |---> [m_1 ... m_n]

on M for each natural n, subject to axioms.  This is as expected so far, but
we've disallowed ourselves from using what would probably be the natural
choice of axioms,

[[m_1^1 ... m_1^{k_1}] ... [m_n^1 ... m_n^{k_n}]] = [m_1^1 ... m_n^{k_n}],
m = [m],

since this is a binary + nullary presentation.  So instead we should derive
from the n-fold multiplications a k-ary operation o_T on M for each (finite,
planar) k-leafed tree T; and the axioms then become that o_T = o_U for any
two k-leafed trees T and U.

The situation gets more extreme still if you want a wholeheartedly
non-binary-and-nullary presentation of the notion of monoidal category.  We
have an underlying category M, an n-fold tensor functor for each n, and then
coherence cells obeying coherence axioms.  The obvious choice for the
coherence cells comes from turning the two equations above into specified
isomorphisms, but again this is disallowed, so we have to specify a coherence
cell o_T --~--> o_U for each T and U, where o_T, o_U are now derived tensor
functors.  Then we need to put axioms on the coherence cells, and once more
the obvious way of doing this involves something of a binary + nullary
character.  Specifically, you have to make sure that the coherence cells o_T
--~--> o_U are compatible with "grafting of trees", which means taking a
k-leafed tree T and sticking onto its leaves k trees T_1, ..., T_k, to make a
new tree T(T_1, ..., T_k) - but this expression has *2* (bad number!) levels
of trees.  So we need to replace these axioms with equivalent
non-binary-and-nullary ones, and this means considering more complicated
structures still.

(The considerations in the last paragraph are really to do with writing down
a non-binary-and-nullary presentation of the theory of operads, which are
themselves monoids of a sort.)

Certainly I did not mean to suggest that either John or Andree were
supporting platonism as a philosophy of mathematics. In fact I had
momentarily even forgotten that John had used the term. In my 1972
Perugia Notes I had made an attempt to characterize the relation between
these sorts of mathematical considerations and philosophy by saying that
while platonism is wrong on the relation between Thinking and Being,
something analogous is correct WITHIN the realm of Thinking. The relevant
dialectic there is between abstract general and concrete
general.
Not concrete particular ("concrete" here does not mean
"real").There is another crucial dialectic making particulars
(neither abstract nor concrete) give rise to an abstract
general; since experiments do not mechanically give rise to theory, it is
harder to give a purely mathematical outline of how that dialectic
works, though it certainly does work. A mathematical model of it can be
based on the hypothesis that a given set of particulars is somehow itself
a category (or graph), i.e., that the appropriate ways of comparing the
particulars are given but that their essence is not. Then their
"natural structure" (analogous to cohomology operations) is an
abstract general and the corresponding concrete general receives a
Fourier-Gelfand-Dirac functor from the original particulars. That
functor is usually not full because the real particulars are infinitely
deep and the natural structure is computed with respect to some
limited doctrine; the doctrine can be varied, or "screwed up or down" as
James Clerk Maxwell put it, in order to see various
phenomena.

This is in reply to Toby Bartels, quoted below.  I don't believe that those 
of us who have written about "ideas" in Ehresmann's sense ever conceived 
that each theory (sketch) was based on one right idea.  There is no 
"correct" idea for a given sketch.

I want to add, for those new to the subject, that the word "sketch" has 
been used with at least three meanings.  Ehresmann and his students use it 
for a structure which is a weakening of the concept of category (the 
composite may not be defined for all composable pairs) plus specified cones 
and/or cocones.  Many others have used the word sketch to refer to a 
category with specified cones and/or cocones.  Michael Barr and I in our 
two books used "sketch" to mean a graph with specified cones and/or cocones 
plus some commutativity conditions on paths; that is in the same spirit as 
Ehresmann's "idea".

That was supposed to be my point.
Just as a group can be described many ways by generators and relations,
so a sketch (if we define a sketch to be an entire category;
apparently that varies) can be described many ways by ideas.
It's the category that truly characterises what a monoid is
(in the given doctrine), so it better deserves the name "idea",
if we're trying to hark back to Plato-n (even just to be cute).
(Whether or not it's too late to change, I can't say.)

2 indices and 0 indices.  *Gulp*  You're right!
I always felt annoyed having to write in that nullary axiom; now I know why.

I suppose that you're aware of this, but note that we need to allow
nodes that don't branch but also aren't labelled (considered leaves),
which is where we place [].  For example, the tree

m           .
 \         /
   \     /
     \./

indicates the product [m[]]; that it equals m is the right unit law.
This threw me for a moment, since [] seemed at first to have disappeared.

We could also go straight to trees and define them as the basic operations,
then requiring as axiom that grafting of trees produces the same result
as composing the operations.

If we were defining a nonassociative operation without identity,
then we could denote the basic operations by *binary* trees.

>Specifically, you have to make sure that the coherence cells o_T

The nullary counterpart is grafting 0 trees to get the tree m.

Well, I managed to introduce grafting back before the categorification!
Aren't I clever?  Too clever for my own good?  ^_^

As long as we learn the lesson that binary operations
warrant a search for their nullary partners,
then we've done the important thing, at least,
even if we miss out on some ever more complicated elegance.

I'm sure that the following is known, but I've never seen it in print.
Does someone have a reference for it?

Proposition.  Let U be a monadic functor, in the sense of Mac Lane's CWM.
If U factors U=HG with H faithful and amnestic, and G having a left adjoint,
then G is monadic.

	Working on the history of category theory I find that Mahlon Marsh Day
hired several category theorists at the University of Illinois
Champaign-Urbana in the 1960s. I would like to know whatever people can
tell me about his connections to category theory--perhaps through Eilenberg?

	Also, does anyone here know whether Mahlon Michael Day was Mahlon Marsh
Day's son? Mahlon Michael Day got a PhD at Chicago in 1967 with Kaplansky.

Thanks, Colin

In talking about defining monoids, Toby Bartels wrote:

"We could also go straight to trees and define them as the basic operations,
then requiring as axiom that grafting of trees produces the same result
as composing the operations."

This is the mu operation of the corresponding monad.  Every single-sorted 
"idea" in the sense of the recent discussion generates a monad in sets with 
a mu like this.  For each set S there is a set of possible computations TS, 
a mu:TTS to TS, and a "OneIdentity" operation in the sense of Mathematica 
that says the computation consisting of a single node results in that node; 
these subject to the monad laws.  In other words, the phenomenon you noted 
is an instance of a general result.

                     Domains VI


           Birmingham, 16-19 September 2002.

    The Workshop on Domains is aimed at computer scientists and
mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
foundations of computation. The workshop will focus on domains, their
applications and related topics.  Previous meetings were held in
Darmstadt (94,99), Braunschweig (96), Munich (97) and Siegen (98). The
emphasis is on the exchange of ideas between participants similar in
style to Dagstuhl seminars.

SCOPE

    Domain theory has had applications to programming language
semantics and logics (lambda-calculus, PCF, LCF), recursion theory
(Kleene-Kreisel countable functionals), general topology (injective
spaces, function spaces, locally compact spaces, Stone duality),
topological algebra (compact Hausdorff semilattices) and analysis
(measure, integration, dynamical systems). Moreover, these
applications are related - for example, Stone duality gives rise to a
logic of observable properties of computational processes.

    As such, domain theory is highly interdisciplinary. Topics of
interaction with domain theory for this workshop include, but are not
limited to:

     program semantics
     program logics
     probabilistic computation
     exact computation over the real numbers
     lambda calculus
     games
     models of sequential computation
     constructive mathematics
     recursion theory
     realizability
     real analysis
     topology
     locale theory
     metric spaces
     category theory
     topos theory
     type theory

SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS

    One-page abstracts should be submitted to

                  domainsvi@cs.bham.ac.uk

    Shortly after an abstract is submitted (usually one or two weeks),
    the authors will be notified by the programme committee. Abstracts
    will be dealt with on a first-come/first-served basis.

DEADLINE

    30 April 2002

Abstract.

Directed Algebraic Topology studies phenomena where privileged directions
appear, derived from the analysis of concurrency, traffic networks,
space-time models, etc.

   This is the sequel of a paper, 'Directed homotopy theory, I. The
fundamental category', where we introduced directed spaces, their non
reversible homotopies and their fundamental category. Here we study some
basic constructs of homotopy, like homotopy pushouts and pullbacks, mapping
cones and homotopy fibres, suspensions and loops, cofibre and fibre
sequences.

	Myles Tierney has told me about a perspective on exact categories,
in the 1960s, that I had not understood. I probably still do not see it
very much the way it looked then. So I ask about it here. What were the
reasons for studying exact categories in the 1960s?

	Here is what I used to think: Every additive category with a
generator has a faithful functor to the category of Abelian groups.
MacLane had explored this idea in 1950. Then Grothendieck's Tohoku paper
axiomatized Abelian categories in a more useful way for homological
algebra, and showed that all sheaf categories satisfied the axioms (i.e.
sheaves of Abelian groups on topological spaces, and the key theorem says
they have enough injectives). That created two reasons to look for a
non-additive generalization. First, to extend from Abelian groups to all
groups, for use in non-Abelian cohomology. (MacLane had already hinted at
replacing Abelian groups by all groups in 1950). And second to axiomatize
sheaves of sets. The exact category axioms were a promising non-additive
analogue to the Abelian category axioms.

	And I have always thought of the Abelian category embedding
theorems as proving that, if you want to, you can think of Abelian
categories as concrete categories with the natural limits and colimits.

	Myles did not disagree with any of that but he put it this way:
Not all categories enriched in Abelian groups are so nicely embeddable in
the category of Abelian groups, but the Abelian categories are.

	This suggested a general question, when does an enriched category
embed nicely in the enriching category? And Myles had a good description
of which Abelian-group enriched categories are Abelian: the exact ones. So
the exact category axioms became an approach to this problem.


	To me this question seems very different from looking for a
non-additive analogue of Abelian categories. Am I wrong about that? How
did this question look in, say, 1970? How did it look at Dalhousie?

Thanks, Colin

Does any one know the answers to these questions?

1. Is trigonometry valid in toposes? (I'll be astonished if it isn't.)
2. Does a polynomial over the complex field C have only finitely many roots?

More precisely:

1. Over any topos with nno, let R be the locale of "formal reals", i.e. the
classifier for the geometric theory of Dedekind sections.

Do sin, cos, arctan, etc. : R -> R exist and satisfy the expected
properties? Are there general results (e.g. on power series) that say Yes,
of course they do?

2. Consider the space S of square roots of the generic complex number.
Working over C, it is the locale corresponding to the squaring map s: C ->
C, z |-> z^2. The fibre over w is the space of square roots of w.

s is not a local homeomorphism, so S is not a discrete locale. Hence we
can't say S is even a set, let alone a finite set in any of the known
senses. I don't believe its discretization pt(S) is Kuratowski finite
either. If I've calculated it correctly, it is S except for having an empty
stalk over zero (oops!), and there is no neighbourhood of zero on which an
enumeration can be given of all the elements of pt(S).

On the other hand, S is a Stone locale - one can easily construct the sheaf
of Boolean algebras that is its lattice of compact opens. That sheaf of
Boolean algebras is not Kuratowski finite, nor even, it seems to me, a
subsheaf of a Kuratowski finite sheaf.

So is there any sense at all in which S is finite?

I knew Mahlon Day at Urbana quite well.  If he had a mathematician son, I
was unaware of it, but you should ask John Gray.  Now as far as I know he
didn't hire so many category theorists.  For example, I was hired by Paul
Bateman.  So was Jon Beck.  As far as I can tell, the only one hired by
Mahlon was John Gray.  And he may have known Eilenberg, but only as one
mathematician may know another.  But your entire question is based on a
misconception that the hiring at Illinois was based on any sort of plan.
The fact is that there was a severe shortage of mathematicians in those
days and UI was hiring a couple dozen people a year (and losing a similar
number) and anyone who was publishing or well recommended and showed any
interest was getting offers.  I got at least one utterly unsolicited firm
offer from a school I had had no contact with.  Possibly, probably,
someone like Sammy had given them my name when asked, but that is all.
And I received a number of invitations to apply for a job and did and got
an offer (and a pay raise from UI).  So they didn't even ask what kind of
math you did, only that you did some kind of math.  Hard to believe what
it was like in those days.

The people at Illinois who were there for the first midwest category
meeting in 1965 were Alex Heller (an algebraic topologist, with an
interest in category theory), John Gray (category theorist), Jon Beck
(algebraic topology & category theory), Max Kelly (there on a one year
leave, category theory), and me (homological algebra).  In fact, I wasn't
even invited originally; I can thank Max for telling Saunders to invite
me.  My interest in category theory developed later at the ETH.  Now
Eckmann is probably the one person most responsible for bringing category
theorists together.  

A history of category theory should talk not only about the founding
fathers, but also a certain number of godfathers, people who were not
category theorists themselves, but strongly encouraged it.  I would
include (but not limit it to) Beno Eckmann, Peter Hilton, Alex Heller,
David Harrison, ....  Of course, there were a number of others who while
not primarily category theorists made actual contributions to category
theory: Grothendieck, Dan Kan, Albrecht Dold and Dieter Puppe,...

Above all, Colin, one should not write a history of category theory
without interviewing as many of these people as are still alive and it is
damned shame that no one has done this till now.  For Eilenberg and
Harrison, it is already too late.

The space of Dedekind reals is Cauchy-complete, so any convergent
power series such as sin or cos defines an endomorphism of it.
Moreover, provided (as in this case) we can calculate a "modulus of
convergense" for the power series explicitly from a bound for x, it's easy
to see that the construction x |--> sin x commutes with inverse image
functors, so it must be induced by an endomorphism of the classifying
topos (that is, of the locale of formal reals).

That's a good question. I've never thought about notionss of finiteness
for non-discrete locales (someone should!). For the set of points of S,
I believe it should be what Peter Freyd called "R-finite" ("R" for
"Russell"): intuitively, this means that there is a bound on the size
of its K-finite subsets. (However, I don't have a proof of this.)
R-finiteness is quite a lot weaker than  \tilde{K}-finiteness (being
locally a subobject of a K-finite object), but it's still a reasonably
well-behaved notion of finiteness (e.g. it is preserved by functors
which preserve all finite limits and colimits).

It is not constructively true, as I conjectured yesterday, that
the set of roots of a polynomial over C is Russell-finite.
Let X be the subspace of C consisting of 0 and all points whose
argument is a rational multiple of \pi, and consider the sheaf of
solutions of z^2 - f = 0, where f: X --> C is the inclusion map.
It is easy to see that the stalk of this sheaf at 0 is
uncountably infinite. Since R-finiteness is preserved by
inverse image functors, this yields a counterexample.

This doesn't, of course, answer Steve Vickers' original question
whether there is a sense in which the *locale* of roots of a
polynomial can be said to be finite. But it does indicate that
the appropriate notion of finiteness, if it exists, must be
a rather delicate one.

As before, let S be the Stone locale of square roots of the generic complex
number. The question is, In what sense can S be considered finite?

Here is one idea that occurs to me.

If a set is acted on transitively by a finite group, then classically it
must be finite (and I dare say some constructive statement of this is also
true).

S is acted on by the discrete group {+1, -1} (by multiplication in C).
Hence if that action can be considered transitive in some way, that would
be a finiteness property of S (or, rather, finiteness _structure_ on S).

If a: S x {+1, -1}  -> S is the action, then I believe I can prove (by
techniques involving the upper powerlocale) that

   <fst, a> : S x {+1, -1}  -> S x S

is a proper surjection. This would seem to be a natural way to capture
transitivity of a and hence a finiteness property of S.

More generally, if an action on a locale by a finite group has only
finitely many orbits (using the above idea to specify transitivity on the
orbits), then that would be a finiteness property of the locale.

One might ask whether, by Galois theory, this can be applied to arbitrary
polynomials over C.

Steve Vickers.

For those who prefer to see the forests and the trees,
that point of view is prominent in the operad/modad/monoidal interaction.
Much such material will be in our book
on Operads (Markl and Shnider and me)

[note from moderator: please direct any responses to the poster, thanks]

It seems prima facie obvious that category theory ought to attract
mathematicians with a philosophical bent, given its potential to
revolutionise foundational issues and the perspective on the nature of
structure that it affords. But do category theorists interest themselves
in aspects of philosophy not directly related to mathematics? I'd be
interested to hear from the category theorists on this group, as well as
about the category theorists that you know or knew well enough to give a
definitive answer.

Of course, if ostensibly nonmathematical philosophy ended up having a
relation to mathematical philosophy or to category theory itself, that
counts too.

I hope that this somewhat extracurricular question is not considered out
of place, and welcome correction if it is.

What is actually a first reference for the fact that for every polynomial
endofunctor of Set a final coalgebra consists of all properly labelled
(finite and infinite) trees? I suspect the first authors to study this
were Arbib and Manes in their
"Parametrized data types do not need...", Information and control 52
(1982), 139-158.
However, it is obvious from that paper that Arbib and Manes were
definitely unaware of the general statement, which explains why they only
mention some special cases in their book in 1986.

Dear colleagues,

could you please circulate this announcement to anyone who might be
interested, particularly bright prospective graduate students.

Thanks, -- Phil, Rick, and Peter


The University of Ottawa Logic Group (in the Mathematics Department) is
looking for qualified PhD and Master's students.  Our group consisting
of Richard Blute, Philip Scott, and Peter Selinger, works in a wide
range of areas of Logic and theoretical computer science, including: 
category theory, categorical logic, proof theory, linear logic, type
theory, programming language theory, theoretical computer science, and
foundations of physics.

The Mathematics Department Graduate Program is part of the
Ottawa-Carleton Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, and provides
a wide range of courses and programs. Ottawa is the capital of Canada,
and a beautiful, bilingual (English and French) city, 200 km west of
Montreal.

Funding for qualified PhD level students in logic is available--an
open competition for graduate students will be held in early February.
It is also possible to apply to pursue graduate studies with us
through SITE (the School of Information Technology and Software
Engineering--Computer Science Division), since some of us are
cross-appointed in Computer Science. Please enquire.

Outside the Mathematics Department, the Logic Group has several other
members, including Amy Felty, Tomoyuki Yamakami, and Luigi Logrippo
(SITE), Doug Howe and Leopoldo Bertossi (Carleton School of Computer
Science), and Mathieu Marion (Philosophy, Ottawa), plus visitors and
postdocs.  We have a weekly seminar in all areas of logic and in which
graduate students are encouraged to present their work.

For more information, see:

  http://quasar.mathstat.uottawa.ca/lfc/    (Logic Group)
  http://quasar.mathstat.uottawa.ca/grad/   (Graduate Program in Math)

Preliminary applications can be completed online, at

                              SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS
                                     CMCS2002

                         5th International Workshop on
                      Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science

                                 Grenoble, France
                                  6-7 April 2002

                       A satellite workshop of ETAPS 2002

Aims and Scope
--------------

During the last few years, it is becoming increasingly clear that a great
variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition systems,
automata, process calculi and class-based systems can be captured
uniformly as coalgebras.  Coalgebra is developing into a field of its own
interest presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a growing field of
applications and interactions with various other fields such as reactive
and interactive system theory, object oriented and concurrent programming,
formal system specification, modal logic, dynamical systems, control
systems, category theory, algebra, analysis, etc. The aim of the workshop
is to bring together researchers with a common interest in the theory of
coalgebras and its applications.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

       the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
               approaches);
       coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
               languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
       coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent)
               programming;
       coalgebras and data types;
       (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
               bisimulations or invariants);
       coalgebras and algebras;
       coalgebraic specification and verification;
       coalgebras and (modal) logic;
       coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid
               systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, and Genova. The proceedings appeared as Electronic
Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS) Volumes 11,19, 33, and 41.
You can get an idea of the types of papers presented at the meeting by
looking at the tables of contents of the ENTCS volumes from the meetings,
available at the ENTCS page.  For venue, registration and suggested
accommodation see the ETAPS2002 web page, http://www-etaps.imag.fr/


Submissions
-----------

Submissions will be evaluated by the Program Committee for inclusion in
the proceedings, which will be published in the ENTCS series. Papers must
contain original contributions, be clearly written, and include
appropriate reference to and comparison with related work. Papers (of at
most 15 pages) should be submitted electronically as uuencoded PostScript
files at the address cmcs@cs.indiana.edu. A separate message should also
be sent, with a text-only one-page abstract and with mailing addresses
(both postal and electronic), telephone number and fax number of the
corresponding author.

                 ***  FIRST  CALL FOR PAPERS ***


  FLoC'2002 Workshop

  IMLA 2: Intuitionistic Modal Logic and Applications '02
          http://floc02.diku.dk/IMLA/

  July 26, 2002
  Copenhagen, Denmark


BACKGROUND

  Constructive and modal logics are of foundational and practical relevance
to Computer Science.  Constructive logics are used as type disciplines for
programming languages, as metalogics for denotational semantics, in the
paradigm of program extraction from proofs and for interactive proof
development in automated deduction systems such as Agda, Coq, Twelf,
Isabelle, HOL, NuPrl and Plastic. Modal logics like temporal logics, dynami=
c
logics and process logics are used in industrial-strength applications as
concise formalisms for capturing reactive behaviour.
Although constructive and modal frameworks have typically been investigated
separately, a growing body of published work shows that both paradigms can
(and should) be fruitfully combined. The goal of this workshop is to
stimulate more systematic study of constructive or Intuitionistic Modal
Logics and, in parallel of modal type theories. It aims to
1. bring together two largely parallel communities - computer scientists
with a focus on proof theory and lambda calculi, and logicians and
philosphers with a focus on model theory;
2. bring together theoretically-oriented and the application-oriented
approaches, in the hope of productive interaction.
Theoretical / methodological issues centre around the question of how the
proof-theoretic strengths of constructive logics can best be combined with
the model-theoretic strengths of modal logics. Two basic questions are thus
"what is the right notion of proof?" and "what is the right way of making a
given modal logic constructive?".
Topics of interest for papers in the Workshop include, but are not limited
to:
      *   applications of intuitionistic necessity or possibility, strong
monads, or evaluation modalities,
      *   use of modal type theory to formalize mechanisms of abstraction
and refinement,
      *  applications of constructive modal logic and modal type theory to
formal verification, abstract interpretation, and program analysis and
optimization
      *  applications of modal types to integration of inductive and
co-inductive types, higher-order abstract syntax, strong functional
programming
      *  computational aspects of the Curry-Howard correspondence between
lambda calculi and logics
      *  extensions of this correspondence by other modalities or
quantifiers
      *  models of constructive modal logics such as algebraic, categorical=
,
Kripke, topological, realizability interpretations
      *    notions of proof for constructive modal logics
      *   extraction of constraints or programs, nonstandard information
extraction techniques
      *  proof search in constructive modal logic and implementations of it


FORMAT

  The workshop will be an informal one-day meeting with two invited
  talks, regular paper presentations, and discussion.

Hello,

    This is another philosophy of math question:

1) What is the constructivist position on infinite
     multigraphs with loops?

2) What is the constructivist position on 
     infinite categories?

Hi,

Recently Prof. Lawvere suggested a model for how
experimental data lead to theory (see enclosed
posting). In this context I would like to mention that
there is similar problem in cognitive science. How do
we acquire knowledge or how is perceptual experience
transformed into conceptual knowledge? Moreover the
discussion on generals & particulars readily lends
itself to interpretation in cognitive terminology. We
may compare particulars with sensation, abstract
generals with categories (not the mathematical
category) such as =91dog=92, and concrete generals with
prototypes. Stretching little further, presentation of
abstract general can be compared with percept (of
dog).

Of all the disciplines to which category theory is
applied such as physics or computer science, I think
the most natural domain of applications for category
theory is cognitive science. Let me explain. Category
theory captures mathematical practice. In the domain
of mathematics, category theory provides a
mathematical account of the process of transforming
ignorance into knowledge. It is reasonable to treat
the growth of mathematical knowledge as a particular
case of knowing in general or cognition. Given that
category theory models a particular case of cognition
(mathematics), one strategy is to generalize the
category theoretic description of the particular case
of mathematical knowing to knowing in general or
cognition. The ease with which we can implement and
realize this research program is inversely
proportional to the =91distance=92 between mathematical
practice and cognitive processes. The more the
cognition is similar to mathematics, the less are the
changes or effort we need to make to the category
theoretic model of mathematics for it to accommodate
cognition in general. In view of the close resemblance
between the cognitive process and the pursuit of
mathematical knowledge (e.g. both describe real in
terms of imaginary), category theoretic study of
cognition is likely to be extremely fruitful.

One could motivate category theory in more concrete
terms. For example, the problem of how perceptual
experiences give rise to conceptual knowledge has a
facet to which category theory has already provided
solution. How do we go from figural or picturesque
perception (geometry, topology) to propositional or
symbolic thinking (algebra, logic)? Category theory
explicated the connections between logic and topology
and these insights can be brought to bear on
comparable perception-thought transformations, and it
possibly gives a cue to the role of thinking vis-=E0-vis
perception. =20

I am sorry if I said something really stupid about
category theory. I simply want to attract category
theorists to cognitive science.

Thanking you,
Sincerely,
Posina Venkata Rayudu

Subject: categories: Re: Sketches and Platonic Ideas=20
Date: Wed, 05 Dec 2001 04:36:21 =20

In my 1972 Perugia Notes I had made an attempt to
characterize the relation between these sorts of
mathematical considerations and philosophy by saying
that while platonism is wrong on the relation between
Thinking and Being, something analogous is correct
WITHIN the realm of Thinking. The relevant dialectic
there is between abstract general and concrete
general. Not concrete particular ("concrete" here does
not mean "real"). There is another crucial dialectic
making particulars (neither abstract nor concrete)
give rise to an abstract general; since experiments do
not mechanically give rise to theory, it is harder to
give a purely mathematical outline of how that
dialectic works, though it certainly does work. A
mathematical model of it can be based on the
hypothesis that a given set of particulars is somehow
itself a category (or graph), i.e., that the
appropriate ways of comparing the particulars are
given but that their essence is not. Then their
"natural structure" (analogous to cohomology
operations) is an abstract general and the
corresponding concrete general receives a
Fourier-Gelfand-Dirac functor from the original
particulars. That functor is usually not full because
the real particulars are infinitely deep and the
natural structure is computed with respect to some
limited doctrine; the doctrine can be varied, or
"screwed up or down" as James Clerk Maxwell put it, in
order to see various phenomena.

Hi,

Does the debate -elements and their belongingness vs.
functions and their composition- support Sapir-Whorf
hypothesis that the way we think is a function of the
language we use. In other words, language can
transform thinking. According to this doctrine of
linguistic relativity, =93users of markedly different
grammars are pointed by their grammars toward
different types of observations=85and hence are not
equivalent as observers, but must arrive at somewhat
different views of the world=94 (Whorf 1956, p. 221).

                      4th WORKSHOP ON HYBRID LOGICS

                      LICS 2002 Affiliated Workshop
                          >>> JULY 25, 2002 <<<
                           Copenhagen, Denmark

                          FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS


 THEME:

 Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic in which it is possible to
 directly refer to worlds/times/states or whatever the elements of the
 (Kripke) model are meant to represent. Although they date back to the
 late 1960s, and have been sporadically investigated ever since, it is
 only in the 1990s that work on them really got into its stride.

 It is easy to justify interest in hybrid logic on applied grounds,
 with the usefulness of the additional expressive power. For example,
 when reasoning about time one often wants to build up a series of
 assertions about what happens at a particular instant, and standard
 modal formalisms do not allow this. What is less obvious is that the
 route hybrid logic takes to overcome this problem (the basic
 mechanism being to add nominals --- atomic symbols true at a unique
 point --- together with extra modalities to exploit them) often
 actually improves the behavior of the underlying modal formalism. For
 example, it becomes far simpler to formulate modal tableau and
 resolution in hybrid logic, and completeness and interpolation
 results can be proved of a generality that is simply not available in
 modal logic. That is, hybridization --- adding nominals and related
 apparatus --- seems a fairly reliable way of curing many known
 weaknesses in modal logic. For more general background on hybrid
 logic, and many of the key papers, see the Hybrid Logics homepage:

                      http://www.hylo.net

 HyLo@LICS is likely to be relevant to a wide range of people,
 including those interested in description logic, feature logic,
 applied modal logics, temporal logic, and labelled deduction.
 Moreover, if you have an interest in the work of the late Arthur
 Prior, note that this workshop is devoted to exploring ideas he first
 introduced 30 years ago --- it will be an ideal opportunity to see
 how his ideas have been developed in the intervening period.

 In this workshop we hope to bring together researchers from all the
 different fields just mentioned (and hopefully some others) in an
 attempt to explore what they all have (and do not have) in common. If
 you're unsure whether your work is of relevance to the workshop,
 please check out the Hybrid Logics homepage. And do not hesitate to
 contact the workshop organisers for more information. We'd be
 delighted to tell you more. Contact details are give below.

 SUBMISSIONS:

 We invite the contribution of research papers to the workshop. Please
 send electronically an extended abstract of up to 10 A4 size pages,
 in PostScript format to: carlos@science.uva.nl BEFORE the 26st of
 APRIL, 2002. Please note that all workshop contributors are required
 by the LICS organizers to register for FLoC 2002.

Learning category theory (which I did after I wrote a dissertation and
several papers in finite fields) certainly changed and improved the way I
did mathematics.  The change indeed deserves to be called a
transformation.  In a similar way, my ability to program in Basic improved
remarkably when I learned the basic ideas of structured programming and
did a little programming in Pascal.  But I am reasonably sure that these
transformations in my thinking occurred because I learned important new
concepts such as limit, adjoint, while-loop, etc.  Learning new concepts
transforms one's thinking.  I am not a linguist, but I know something of
Whorf's ideas; I don't understand how one can disentangle the effect of
knowing the different concepts that different cultures have from the
effect of knowing their language.

This brings up the question: Can concepts be differentiated from language?  
I say via introspection that the answer is "certainly", because when I
concentrate on a mathematical problem (or how to reassemble a machine or
write a complicated program) the "talking" in my head goes away and is
replaced by pictorial concepts located in mental space.  Some people claim
that this never happens to them.  If that is true, it would appear that
people come in two different varieties, from Mars and from Venus maybe.
But I suspect that the people who claim it never happens are simply wrong:
they lack sufficient introspective ability.

> This brings up the question: Can concepts be differentiated from language?

Two quite different examples: first, a very practical one.

This is of vital importance in teaching computing. Programming languages
come and go,
and to be reasonably future-proof a programming course must go beyond merely
"teaching a programming language" and bring out concepts.

Some evidence that concepts can be differentiated from language is seen in
the graphical Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for developing
object oriented programs. For instance, if you compare those for Java with
those for C++ you find that broadly similar diagrammatic metaphors (grab an
object, place it somewhere, link it to other objects to handle certain
events, etc.) get implemented in rather different ways in different
languages.

This sounds very like Charles's replacement of talking in his head by
pictorial concepts. Its effectiveness in IDEs is indisputable, and it seems
to be because the language by itself in some way hobbles your thought
processes (cf. Basic programming improved by knowing Pascal).

A quite different example is that of foundations, how choice of logic
affects what you can recognize as mathematics.

But don't get me going on that.

Merry Christmas,

Steve Vickers.

In the film "A Beautiful Mind," the first indication that John Nash is
regaining his abilities is a conversation with a student ("Galois
extensions are really the same as covering spaces!" exclaims Toby, the
student). The scene ends with Nash and the student bent over some
papers and -- as I heard it -- the student says:

    "Functor...Two...Categories"

(The film's not bad but its relation to Nash's life is tangential. If I
had not absorbed a hint from a review, I think I might have stomped
out in the middle because of the ridiculous portrayal of what
mathematicians do. It turns out that the filmmakers are playing a game
-- very effective with most of the audience -- in sliding between
perceptions: ours and Nash's.)

I am still trying to understand some enriched category theory.  Suppose
V is a closed symmetric monoidal category that is also locally
presentable.  Suppose C is a small V-category.  I am interested in the
category of V-functors from C to V, and, in particular, I want to know
that it is locally presentable.  Might need some hypotheses on C for
this, but I would prefer to avoid hypotheses on the actual functors.

This time I have actually looked in Kelly's book and I did not see it,
but I confess to finding this subject rough going so might have missed
it.  On the other hand, my library is closed for the holiday, so I have
not looked at Adamek and Rosicky's book on enriched category theory yet.

I guess the generators ought to be the representable functors.  I know
everything is a weighted colimit of representables, but I don't know
whether this colimit is filtered enough, nor do I know whether one can
get away with weighted colimits instead of ordinary ones.  

One direction this might go is to develop a theory of locally
presentable in an enriched sense, using weighted colimits instead of
colimits.  I would prefer to avoid that if possible.

Mark Hovey's letter of 26 Dec - known as Boxing Day in the British-speaking
world - suggests that it might be a good idea to develop a theory of local
presentability and all that in the context of enriched categories. In fact
such a theory was developed in my paper [Structures defined by finite limits
in the enriched context I, Cahiers de Top. et Geom. Differentielles 23 (1982),
3 - 42]. Everything works very smoothly; but there are a few annoying
misprints, many of which seem to be my own fault. Further developments can be 
found in [Blackwell-Kelly-Power, Two-dimensional monad theory, J. Pure Appl. 
Algebra 59 (1989), 1 - 41] and in [Kelly-Power, Adjunctions whose counits are 
coequalizers and presentations of finitary enriched monads, J. Pure Appl. 
Algebra 89 (1993), 163 - 179], among other papers of myself and of others;
Brian Day, Steve Lack, John Power, and Ross Street have all written on related
matters.

Please accept, Mark, my best wishes for your future work in this direction. In 
any case, New Year's Eve is a fine time to send greetings more generally to
Bob and all on this Bulletin Board.

Warm regards - Max Kelly.

Feedback, trace and fixed point semantics
We introduce a notion of category with feedback-with-delay, closely 
related to the notion of traced monoidal category, and show that the
Circ construction of [JPAA 115: 141--178, 1997] is the free category 
with feedback on a symmetric monoidal category. Combining with the Int
construction of Joyal-Street-Verity [Math. Proc. Camb.Phil. Soc., 119,
447-468, 1996] we obtain a description of the free compact closed 
category on a symmetric monoidal category. We thus obtain a categorical 
analogue of the classical localization of a ring with respect to a 
multiplicative subset. In this context we define a notion of fixed-point 
semantics of a category with feedback which is seen to include a variety 
of classical semantics in computer science.

It seems like there are natural disasters, first in Sydney and, to a
lesser extent, in Buffalo (82 inches of snow by one report) and I would
like to enquire how all are.

I don't know quite what Peter's point is here: there is no difference between
the spoken forms of "2-categories" and "two-categories". I think we all write
"2-categories", as we write "n-categories" and "w-categories", where I am
making-do with "w" for a lower-case Greek omega. Yet Blackwell, Power, and I,
when we considered general questions about the algebras for 2-monads and the
various kinds of strict and non-strict morphisms of these and some adjunctions
between the 2-categories that arise, entitled our paper "Two-dimensional monad
theory". I don't think "2-monad theory" would have represented our concerns as
well, being capable of interpretation as meaning a wider study than ours, or a 
narrower one, depending on how it was taken by the reader. To the Australian
Research Council, such work is described as research on two-dimensional
universal algebra.

What do others think?

Regards - Max.

The fires here in Sydney are still blazing away, but that didn't stop
the new year's fireworks display from going ahead just a few hours ago.
As far as I am aware, no (human) lives have been lost, but there's been
a great deal of property damage, and an immense amount of national
parkland has been burned away.

In truth, most Sydneysiders are unaffected except for the appalling air
quality and the fact that a fine layer of ash has been deposited over
the entire city, which people will no doubt discover on their desks as
they return to work!

You can take a look at some eerie pictures of the Sydney skyline here:

I forget who said what, but I think the issue was that when folks
are talking in this movie, you can't easily tell whether they are 
saying "2-categories" or "two categories", i.e. a couple of categories.  

This problem comes up a lot in my life, and I am glad to see it 
finally showing up in a major motion picture!  E.g., I must be
careful never to say "functor between two categories", replacing 
it by "functor from one category to another".
 
I would be shocked if they were talking about 2-categories in
this movie.  Even mentioning categories must seriously diminish 
their ticket sales, much less 2-categories.  

On a wholly different note, how are the category theorists in
Sydney?
