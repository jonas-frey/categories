Or, I hope this is the same question, is an elementary topos with a natural
numbers object internally locally finitely presentable?  Are there any
references for this?

The answer is yes, but (like a great many such things) I don't think
it is written down anywhere. Finite cardinals are internally finitely
presentable (the proof of this is similar to the proof that they are
internally projective, see 6.25 in "Topos Theory"), and the fact that
every object is internally a filtered colimit of finite cardinals
is implicit in the construction of the object classifier (cf. 6.32
in the same reference).

Regarding the notion of LFP category as one way (amongst many) of
formulating a generalised (but finitary) algebraic theory,
    Set is the category of models of the theory with
    one sort, no operations and (of course) no equations.

However, one must be careful.

Is the category   Set^N  lfp?

The idea is that an object X is finitely presentable if homming from
it preserves filtered colimits.  (It is also interesting to
investigate directed unions, and filtered colimits of surjections.)

But which homming functor do we mean?
  -  the external one     C(X,-) : C -> Set
  -  or the internal one  (-)^X  : C -> C   (if C is a CCC or a topos).

An object  X=(X_n) of  Set^N is
  -  externally FP iff  sum_n X_n is finite, so Some m.All n>n. X_n=0,
  -  internally FP iff  each  X_n is finite.
So there are far more internally FP objects than externally FP ones.

This comes from Section 6.6 of "Practical Foundations of Mathematics",
   http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations/html/s66.html

One more variation on the ``internal lfp'' theme.

Continuing Paul Taylor's

, one might also ask - which filteredness do we mean? In other words, in
the condition `all finite diagrams can be coned', there might be several
inequivalent finiteness notions to consider. For example, several such
notions appeared in early works by Kock, Lecouturier and Mikkelsen, by
Johnstone and Linton; Japie Vermeulen was investigating embeddability into
a K-finite object; and, as far as I know, Richard Squire has discovered a
whole infinite sequence of (intuitionistically, but not classically)
inequivalent finiteness notions. I would appreciate references to any
other investigations of finite presentability in this context.

I have now written a 7-page "manifesto" that gives a non-technical
introduction to the ideas behind Abstract Stone Duality, summarises
the four (draft or published) papers that I have written so far,
and describes the directions for further work.

In particular,
	"Subspaces in Abstract Stone Duality"
is the successor to
	"Sober Spaces and Continuations",
which I advertised on 1 September.

It shows how any category with an exponentiable object Sigma can be
completed to one in which the adjunction Sigma^(-) -| Sigma^(-) is monadic.
This is done in three ways: using the algebras directly,  by formally
adjoining Sigma-split equalisers, and by extending the lambda-calculus
with an "axiom of comprehension".   This last, and the normalisation
theorem that erases the subtype information, is what I presented at
the APPSEM workshop in Darmstadt in March.   However, although the
mathematical details are more or less all present, the paper is a long
way from being finished.

As usual, all comments are welcome.

Paul

(I meant to send this to "categories" last week - by mistake it
only went to Mamuka.  Sorry if it's now out of context.)

Mamuka Jibladze added to my comments on finite presentability,

Indeed so.  That's why I cited Section 6.6 ("Finiteness") of my book -
I should have been more explcit about that.   Not, of course, that
I mean that to be an exhaustive account of the various notions of
finiteness.

There was a stress on "intuitionistic" in Michael Abbott's original
email, which has perhaps got lost in the ensuing discussion.
I remember getting very worried about being careful about this,
and for example my unpublished paper "The Synthetic Plotkin
Powerdomain" with Wesley Phoa was more complicated than it needed
to be because I didn't at the time have his confidence in
discussing finiteness intuitionistically (= in an elementary topos).

However, what I found in writing "Practical Foundations" (with regard
to many things but especially) about finiteness is that the
traditional ("classical") idioms of mathematical argument are
perfectly valid, once one understands the way in which they 
are idioms for using the rules of natural deduction.  The rules
for the existential quantifier apparently look very different
from the vernacular use of the phrase "there exists" (in which one
goes on to make use of the witness),  but the correspondence
is very clear and natural when you think about it - see Section 1.6.

Should this be exponentiating rather than exponentiable? That was my reading
of the version of the paper that I saw - what's postulated is the ability to
form Sigma^X for every X rather than X^Sigma.

Incidentally, this points up the fact that, as an approach to topology, ASD
limits itself to locally compact spaces (or - let us focus on - locales). I
know Paul has his own justifications for this limitation.

However, some of the features Paul mentioned actually work more generally.
For instance, I have recently found that there is a monad PP on the category
Loc of all locales that agrees with Sigma^(Sigma^(-)) on the locally compact
ones (Sigma = Sierpinski locale). Then if you define Coloc ("colocales") to
be the opposite of the category of PP-algebras you get an adjunction
Sigma^(-) -| Sigma^(-) analogous to Paul's but between Loc and Coloc. PP is
the composite of the upper and lower powerlocales and the construction is
mentioned briefly in my paper with Peter Johnstone, "Preframe presentations
present".

AMAST 2002 FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
9-th International Conference on Algebraic Methodology And Software Technology 
AMAST 2002, September 9-13, 2002
St. Gilles les Bains, Reunion Island, France

Important Dates:
   Paper submissions                  February 1, 2002
   Notification of paper acceptance   April 27, 2002
   Camera ready papers                June 1, 2002
   AMAST 2002 conference              September 9-13, 2002

Goals:
The major goal of the  AMAST Conferences is to promote research
that may lead to the setting of software technology on a firm,  
mathematical basis. This goal is achieved by a large international
cooperation with contributions from both academia and industry.
The virtues of a software technology developed on a mathematical basis
have been envisioned as being capable of providing software that is
(a) correct, and the correctness can be proved mathematically, 
(b) safe, so that it can be used in the implementation of critical
systems, (c) portable, i.e., independent of computing platforms
and language generations, and (d) evolutionary, i.e., it is
self-adaptable and evolves with the problem domain.

All previous editions of the AMAST Conference, which were held at 
Iowa City (1989,1991), Twente (1993), Montreal (1995), Munich (1996),
Sydney (1997), Manaus (1999), and Iowa City (2000), made contributions
to the AMAST goals by reporting and disseminating academic and
industrial achievements within the AMAST area of interest. 
During these meetings, AMAST attracted an international following 
among researchers and practitioners interested in software technology,
programming methodology and their algebraic and logical foundations.
In addition, starting with the 1993 edition, the first day of each
conference was dedicated to Mathematics Education for Software
Engineers. 


Submissions:
As in previous years, we invite papers reporting original research
on setting software technology on a firm mathematical basis. We expect two
kinds of submissions for this conference: technical papers and system
demonstrations. Of particular interest is research on using algebraic,
logic, and other formalisms suitable as foundations for software
technology, as well as software technologies developed by means of
logic and algebraic methodologies. Submissions should not have been
published and should not be under consideration for publication
elsewhere. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the
following: 

SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY:
   systems software technology
   application software technology
   concurrent and reactive systems
   formal methods in industrial software development
   formal techniques for software requirements, design.

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY:
   logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms 
   constraint programming and concurrency
   program verification and transformation
   programming calculi
   specification languages and tools
   formal specification and development case studies.

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS:
   logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra
   algebraic foundations for languages and systems, coinduction
   theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning
   logics of programs.

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers):
   software development environments
   support for correct software development
   system support for reuse
   tools for prototyping
   component based software development tools
   validation and verification
   computer algebra systems
   theorem proving systems.

We invite prospective authors to submit electronically previously
unpublished papers of high quality.  Papers must be no longer than 15
pages (6 pages for system demonstrations) and should be prepared using
LaTeX and the LNCS style that can be downloaded from the URL:
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html
Please send a fully self-contained PostScript file to
amast@loria.fr
If for any reason it is impossible to submit a paper electronically,
authors should send six copies of their submission to the program
chair at the address below. 

All papers will be refereed by the programme committee, and will be
judged based on their significance, technical merit, and relevance
to the conference. As in the past, the AMAST'2002 proceedings
are expected to be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes
in Computer Science Series. 
Papers should be received by February 1, 2002.

FOUR research positions available

Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh

 and
Institut fur Informatik, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen

     on the "Mobile Resource Guarantees" project
     http://www.lfcs.ed.ac.uk/mrg

    Closing date: 31 October 2001

The University of Edinburgh and LMU Munich are beginning a joint
project entitled "Mobile Resource Guarantees" (MRG) funded by the
European Commission under the Global Computing initiative.  The
project aims to build foundational and practical infrastructure for
endowing mobile code with independently verifiable certificates as to
its resource consumption.  These certificates take the form of
condensed formal proofs, generated from typing derivations in linear
type systems for describing resource bounds of high-level code.

A wide variety of technical work is involved, ranging from theory to
development of prototype implementations.  We seek applicants who are
willing and able to contribute to a team effort, with a strong
background in some combination of the following areas:

   program logic and proof systems, formal methods
   type systems and static analysis
   semantics of programming languages
   (concrete) computational complexity theory
   compilation techniques for functional and OO programs
   programming of embedded systems and/or smartcards

Alternatively, applicants may have a strong general CS background
and be willing to invest some time and energy to catch up on a new
and exciting topic.  A PhD or equivalent research background is
required.

The project is scheduled to start in January 2002 and run for three
years.  Two research positions are available in Edinburgh and two in
Munich.  In appointing to these positions, we will attempt to optimize
the mix of backgrounds and interests at each site and across the
project as a whole.  It is expected that appointments will be for
three years at one site or the other, but there may be scope for
shorter appointments as well as for slightly longer appointments
involving another closely related project, and also for appointments
for part of the time at each of the two sites.

Candidates should apply to either Edinburgh or Munich by 31 October
2001.  Applicants who are willing to work at either site should apply
to Edinburgh, and clearly indicate this willingness on their
application.  Applicants should send a CV, a statement of the
relevance of their background to the MRG project, and contact
information for 2-3 referees.  Applications to Edinburgh should quote
reference 310850 and be sent to Personnel Department, University of
Edinburgh, 9-16 Chambers Street, Edinburgh EH1 1HT (fax +44 131 650
6509, or apply on-line at www.jobs.ed.ac.uk).  Applications to Munich
should be sent to Professor Martin Hofmann, Institut fur Informatik,
Oettingenstrasse 67, 80538 Munchen, Germany (fax +49 89 2178 2238,
e-mail mhofmann@informatik.uni-muenchen.de).  Appointments in
Edinburgh will be on the AR1A scale, 17451-26229 per annum.
Appointments in Munich will be on the BATIIa scale, 4000-6253DM per
month plus a supplement from 1034DM per month depending on family
circumstances.

For more information, visit http://www.lfcs.ed.ac.uk/mrg.  In
Edinburgh, contact Don Sannella <dts@dcs.ed.ac.uk>, telephone
+44 131 650 5184.  In Munich, contact Martin Hofmann
<mhofmann@informatik.uni-muenchen.de>, telephone +49 89 2178 2144.

Edinburgh and Munich are both wonderful cities to live in, with a
dynamic cultural life as well as easy access to spectacular
countryside.

Dear friends,

a short follow-up to the discussion thread initiated by Jules Bean.

The history of categories where each object is also a bimonoid (that
is, as Tom Leinster pointed out, those self dual categories such that
for each object "a" there is an arrow "a -> a \otimes a" and an arrow
"a -> e", wher "e" is the unit of the tensor product \otimes) is quite 
a long one.  They appeared with various names (and eventually with 
just either the monoid or the co-monoid structure) such as categories 
of relations, Cartesian bicategories, etc, etc... We tried to give some 
references to all that in a recent, applicative paper of ours, "Some 
algebraic laws for Spans (and their connections with Multirelations)", 
call it [SAL] for short, and more are present in the papers of the our 
group mentioned there (see also the forthcoming paper "normal form for 
algebras of connections", to appear in TCS, and the references in
there).


@inproceedings{BG:SAL,
    author = {Bruni, R. and Gadducci, F.},
    title ={Some algebraic laws for spans 
            (and their connections with multirelations)},
    booktitle = {Proceedings of RelMiS 2001, 
                 Relational Methods in Software},
    editor = {Kahl, W. and  Parnas, D.L. and Schmidt, G.},
    series = {ENTCS},
    volume = {44},
    number = {3},
    year = {2001},
}


The paper [SAL] is just a straighforward exercise in Set theory. 
Nevertheless, it gives concrete, and very simple examples, of
categories where objects are bimonoids, but the axioms these
two structures satisfy are different. On the one hand, you find what
could be called the generalization of Frobenious algebras, where the
axiom F indeed holds

> 
> *  *      *   *
>  \/       |\  |
>   |   =   | \ |
>   |       |  \|
>  /\       |   |
> *  *      *   *
> 


and what could be called the generalization of Hopf algebras, where 
instead a different axiom holds, as represented by

> 
> *  *      *    *
>  \/       |\  /|
>   |   =   | \/ |
>   |       | /\ |  
>  /\       |/  \|
> *  *      *    *
>          

Hope it may be of help.

Fabio and Roberto


PS Note that any category where each object is a bimonoid, satisfying
the F axiom, is also compact closed: a new thread in itself... :-)

PPS About analogies for the differences between the axiomatisations,
Jules proposed

Or just think about relations and equivalence relations: in the latter,
you always need to close by transitivity. Less of an analogy, in fact,
than of a theorem... Anyhow, for the network analogy, see in particular 
the book "Network Algebra" by Stefanescu, Springer, 2000.

Elements of stream calculus (an extensive exercise in coinduction) 
Technical Report  SEN-R0120, CWI, Amsterdam, 2001.

Abstract:
Based on the presence of a final coalgebra structure on the set of streams
(infinite sequences of real numbers), a coinductive calculus of streams is
developed.  The main ingredient is the notion of stream derivative, with
which both coinductive proofs and definitions can be formulated. In close
analogy to classical analysis, the latter are presented as behavioural
differential equations.  A number of applications of the calculus are
presented, including difference equations, analytical differential
equations, continued fractions, and some problems from discrete
mathematics and combinatorics.

The report will also appear in Volume 45 of 
Elsevier's ENTCS series, which contains 
the proceedings of MFPS 17.

the position of an average CNRS's CR2 researcher, that is, the
retribution of a young tenure researcher with few years of
post-doc career.

Applicants should have (or expect soon to have) a Ph.D. and
justify experience with at least one of these themes:

- concurrency and process calculi 
- type systems 
- formal verification
- static analysis
- language-based security
- security protocols
- proof systems
- formal methods

For application and further information please contact Giuseppe
Castagna (Giuseppe.Castagna@ens.fr) and consult the following
page http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/projects/myths/
Similar positions are available at the University of Venice and
at University of Sussex, as well.


Ecole Normale Superieure is one of the most prestigious
universities and research center in France. Sited in the center
of Paris it prepares few highly selected students, and it
counts among its former students several Nobel awards and Field
medalists. The computer science department counts groups on
cryptology, abstract interpretation, languages and logics,
networks, computational geometry, and reconfigurable systems.

=09=09First announcement and Call for papers
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Aims and Scope

 The growing diffusion of internet services and applications is
 promoting global computing as an emerging model of computation. Based
 on mobility of code and computation on networks with highly dynamic
 topologies, the model needs effective infrastructures to support the
 coordination and control of components loaded at runtime from
 untrusted sources, as well as semantic frameworks to reason on the
 behaviour and properties of applications.=20

 Foundations of Wide Area Network Computing focuses on semantics
 aspects of global computing, and invites submissions of original
 scientific work thereof. A non-exclusive list of topics includes:
 calculi, models, and semantic theories of concurrent, distributed,
 mobile, global-computingsystems; languages, security and types for
 global computing.=20

 The workshop proceedings will be published in the ENTCS series and a
 selection of papers will appear in a special issue of the Journal of
 Theoretical Computer Science. It will be held as a ICALP2002 satellite
 event under the auspices of the EATCS.=20

                4th International Workshop on
       Rewriting Logic and its Applications (WRLA2002)

                         Pisa, Italy
                    19-21 September, 2002

------------------------------------------------------------

Aims and Scope

Rewriting logic (RL) is a natural model of computation and
an expressive semantic framework for concurrency,
parallelism, communication and interaction. It can be used
for specifying a wide range of systems and languages in
various application fields. It also has good properties as a
framework for representing logics. Several languages based
on RL (ASF+SDF,CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude, etc.) have been
designed and implemented. The aim of the workshop is to
bring together researchers with a common interest in RL and
its applications.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

o foundations, models, and extensions of RL;
o languages based on RL;
o RL as a logical framework;
o applications of RL to:
   - object-oriented systems;
   - concurrent and/or parallel systems;
   - interactive, distributed, open ended and mobile systems;
   - specification of languages and systems;
o rewriting approaches to behavioral specifications;
o comparisons of RL with existing formalisms having
  analogous aims.

In addition to the presentations of research results, the
program will include tutorials and invited presentations,
system demonstrations and panel discussions on specific
research topics.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in
Asilomar, Pont-a-Mousson and Kanazawa. The proceedings
appeared as ENTCS Vols. 4, 15 and 36.

------------------------------------------------------------

Location

WRLA2002 will be held in Pisa on 19-21 September, 2002, at
the congress center (ex Convento delle Benedettine) of the
local bank (Cassa di Risparmio di Pisa).

Greetings to all,

       I'm a big fan of category theory, but doesn't it seem strange 
that after all this time
there is no programming language that let's you organize things around 
categorical ideas?
I've semi-seriously tried to find out about this ( 
http://physics.bu.edu/~youssef/aldor/aldor.html )
but I basically don't have an answer.  I'd be very interested to hear if 
anyone
is working in this direction or comments about why this hasn't happened.

Dear Saul:
   There are several category-based programming languages, but
they may be a bit hard to find on first glance.  Here are three that
come to mind, but I'm sure you will hear about more:

1.  The most famous is CAML, which stands for Categorical Abstract Machine
Language, and is a variant of ML, a well-known and robust polymorphic
functional language.  The original implementations arose from work on
categorical combinators, but now is an autonomous programming language by
itself.   http://caml.inria.fr/

2.  Two category theorists who have developped programming languages are:

(i) Robin Cockett, with his language Charity:
      http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/Research/charity/home.html

(ii) Barry Jay, with his language FISh:

This is actually quite feasible using existing tools. For instance, that
we don't need to put the existence of exponentials in the definition of a
topos (i.e. a terminal object, subobject classifier, power objects, and
pullbacks suffice to construct exponentials) can be proved formally.

Saul,

We've applied The Kestrel Institute's Specware package, which implements 
category-theoric constructs to derive software from knowledge structures.  
We've demonstrated that we can generate engineering design software.  
We've also applied Specware in an investigation of mathematically-defined 
ontologies as a language-neutral knowledge repository for knowledge-based 
systems.  Some references to our work are

[1] Unpublished paper describing systems synthesis (written by my colleague 
Keith Williamson), which can be found in the following page:
