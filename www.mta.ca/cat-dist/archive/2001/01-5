I am attempting to construct the ideal abelian category within which live
complete, hausdorff abelian topological groups.  The idea is that the
quotients of such a group, in the abelian category, would be completions
of the group with respect to topologies coarser than the given one.  The
subobjects would be those topologies.  Of course, having a topology as an
object in the abelian category means we have to have objects in the category
other than abelian groups.

Of course I want to know if this has been done before.  Also, what other ideas
are there about the ideal abelian category containing these groups?  Mac Lane
felt that compactly-generated spaces formed the ideal base category for
topological algebra.  I seem to be using the category of complete, hausdorff
uniform spaces as a base category.  I wrote a paper on (universal) algebras
with a compatible uniformity, and got some nice results about the congruence
(actually, uniformity) lattices.  But, admittedly, algebras with compatible
uniformities have drawbacks as a foundation for topological algebra because
even something like the complex numbers cannot be formalized as such, the
multiplication not being uniformly continuous.

One thing is clear: your ideal abelian category is not abelian.
Furthermore, you don't get to choose your sub- and quotient objects; they
are imposed by the category.  Moreover, although a weaker topology (or an
abelian group with a weaker topology, which is what I assume is meant) is
certainly a subobject, it is not regular, which every subobject in an
abelian category must be.  In fact, the only abelian categories of
topological abelian groups I am aware of are the discrete groups and the
dual category of compact groups.  For me, the ideal category of
topological abelian groups is SP(LCA), the subobjects of products of
locally compact abelian groups.  It is not abelian, but it is
*-autonomous. It is equivalent to the category of weakly topologized
abelian groups or SP(R/Z), subobjects of powers of the circle.

Hi,
whenever I'm teaching basic category theory, students
ask me if there is a connection between limits in the
categorical sense and limits in the analytical sense,
e.g. the limit of a sequence of real numbers.
I've never found an answer to this question.

So I'd be very grateful for answers to one of the following:
- Can the limit of a sequence of real numbers be expressed
  as a categorical limit (of course it can if the sequence is
  monotone, but what if it is not)?
- Why have people chosen the term "limit" in category theory?
  (And, by the way, who has defined it first?)

Many thanks in advance

Tobias

============================================================================

                           FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

                  [Deadline for submission: 1st June 2001]

                           2001 Haskell Workshop

                     Firenze, Italy, 2nd September 2001

        The Haskell Workshop forms part of the PLI 2001 colloquium
        on Principles, Logics, and Implementations of high-level
        programming languages, which comprises the ICFP/PPDP conferences
        and associated workshops. Previous Haskell Workshops have been
        held in La Jolla (1995), Amsterdam (1997), Paris (1999), and
        Montreal (2000).

        http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/ralf/hw2001.{html,pdf,ps,txt}

============================================================================

Scope
-----

The purpose of the Haskell Workshop is to discuss experience with
Haskell, and possible future developments for the language.  The scope
of the workshop includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory,
application, implementation, and teaching of Haskell.  Submissions that
discuss limitations of Haskell at present and/or propose new ideas for
future versions of Haskell are particularly encouraged.  Adopting an
idea from ICFP 2000, the workshop also solicits two special classes of
submissions, application letters and functional pearls, described
below.

Application Letters
-------------------

An application letter describes experience using Haskell to solve
real-world problems. Such a paper might typically be about six pages,
and may be judged by interest of the application and novel use of
Haskell.

Functional Pearls
-----------------

A functional pearl presents - using Haskell as a vehicle - an idea that
is small, rounded, and glows with its own light. Such a paper might
typically be about six pages, and may be judged by elegance of
development and clarity of expression.

Submission details
------------------

Deadline for submission:        1st June 2001
Notification of acceptance:     12th July 2001
Final submission due:           1st August 2001
Haskell Workshop:               2nd September 2001

Authors should submit papers in postscript format, formatted for A4
paper, to Ralf Hinze (ralf@cs.uu.nl) by 1st June 2001. Use of the
ENTCS style files is strongly recommended.  The length should be
restricted to the equivalent of 5000 words (which is approximately 24
pages in ENTCS format, or 12 pages in ACM format).  Note that this
word limit represents a change from the first call for papers.
Application letters and functional pearls should be labeled as such on
the first page; they may be any length up to the above limit, though
shorter submissions are welcome.  The accepted papers will initially
appear as a University of Utrecht technical report, and subsequently
be published as an issue of Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer
Science.

\section*{Why a new diagram package?}

This started when a user of my old package, diagram, wrote to ask me if
dashed lines were possible.  The old package had dashed lines for
horizontal and vertical arrows, but not any other direction.  The reason
for this was that \LaTeX\ used rules for horizontal and vertical arrows,
but had its own fonts for other directions.  While rules could be made
any size, the smallest lines in other directions were too long for
decent looking dashes.  Presumably, Lamport was worried about compile
time and file size if the lines were too short, considerations that have
diminished over the years since.  Also arrows could be drawn in only 48
different directions, which is limiting.  My macros were not very well
implemented for slopes like 4 and 1/4, since I never used such lines.

There was certainly an alternative, \xypic, for those who wanted
something better.  But it was hard to learn and I was not entirely happy
with the results.  The basic interface used an \verb+\halign+.  This
meant that no extra space was allotted to an arrow that had a large
label.  In addition, the different slots could have different horizontal
size, which could result in a misshapen diagram.  I used it in a paper
that had a `W' shaped diagram whose nodes had different widths and the
result was quite obviously misshapen.  On the other hand, the graphics
engine underlying \xypic\ is really quite remarkable and it occurred to
me that I could try to redraft diagram as a front end.  The result is
the current package.  It has been tested only with version 3.7, so there
is no guarantee it would work with any earlier version (or, for that
matter, later).

The syntax described below is not compatible with the original diagram
package.  Every front end of this sort represents a trade-off between
simplicity and utility.  A package that simply upgraded the syntax to
allow more dashed (and dotted) lines would have been just as easy to
implement, but would have made poor use of the wonderful possibilities
of the underlying \xypic\ package.  Also there would have been too many
different arrow specifications (they would have had to go at least in
the range $[-9,9]$) for easy memory) and still would not have included
things like inclusion arrows.  To those who would have liked a simpler
syntax, I apologize.  To those who would want more flexibility, I remind
that the entire \xypic\ package is there for use.

\subsection*{Errant spaces}
 There is one point that cannot be made too strongly.  {\em Watch for
errant spaces.} Unlike the old diagram package, which was carried out in
math mode so that spaces were ignored, \xypic\ is not in math mode and
spaces will mess up your diagrams.  On the other hand, it will not be
necessary to enclose duplicate nodes inside \verb+\phantom+, since the
registration between different nodes is perfect.  In the old package,
for reasons that I now understand, objects did not always register
properly.  This was a flaw built in to the very heart of the package and
is not worth correcting, although it could have been done better in the
first place.  If you see an object in double vision, then the almost
certain cause is that a space has gotten in there somewhere.  I have
attempted to prevent this by liberal use of \verb+\ignorespaces+ in the
definitions, but one cannot always be sure and while testing, I found a
number seemingly innocuous spaces that messed up diagrams.  When in
doubt, always terminate a specification with a \verb+%+.  See the
examples.

\subsection*{What's new in version 2}


\begin{enumerate}
 \item \verb+\scalefactor{decimal number}+ changes all dimensions by the
factor.

\item New macros \verb+\Square, \hSquares, \vSquares+ that calculate
their own widths.

\item New macro \verb+\cube+.

\item Internal macro \verb+\label+ that conflicted with \LaTeX\ renamed.

\item Added certain procedures designed for inline and displayed
equations that are not full-fledged diagrams.  These also calculate
the length of the arrow to contain the label.

\item Corrected certain spacing anomolies.

\item Now does work with plain \TeX.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{What's new in version 3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Two syntax changes:}  The \verb+\morphism+ macro now uses the
syntax \verb.\morphism[N`N;L]. for consistency with all the shapes.  And
the back ticks (\verb.`.) has been eliminated from the label placement
parameters.  It was useless and slightly annoying.  Each one consists of
exactly one character and the standard \TeX\ parser deals with that
automatically.  I gave a thought to doing the same for the arrow shape
but then anything beyond a single character would require braces, which
are also annoying.

 \item The macro \verb+\square+ has been given defaults and the
leading groups of parameters are now optional.  The defaults are
 \verb+(0,0)|a|/>/<500,0>+.  The meaning of \verb+a+ on a vertical arrow
is to the left if it points up and to the right if it points down.

 \item The 10\% (actually it was more like 12\%) error in the lengths of
2-arrows at different slopes has been reduced to well under 1\% by using
one Newton's method iteration on the original approximation of the
square root of \verb-dx^2 + dy^2-.

\item The example of a pair of inline arrows had the diagram appearing
about 3 points below the line of the text.  By enclosing it in a math
emvironment, this has been repaired (although the reason mystifies me).

\item A very obscure bug in the handling of the \verb+~+ (caused by its
being an active character) has been repaired so that you can get a wavy
arrow with \verb+~>+ as the arrow shape specification.

\end{enumerate}

The first one is relatively minor; the second is unlikely to matter
since \verb+\to+ and its relatives is much more flexible; the third
would arise only if you used wavy arrows.  The package seems to have
converged.  I am not planning on adding any more procedures, although I
will try to fix any further bugs that are called to my attention.  Thus
this version is the one that will be released shortly.


\section*{The basic syntax}

The basic syntax is built around an operation \verb+\morphism+ that is
used as
 \begin{verbatim}
 \morphism(x,y)|placement|/{shape}/<dx,dy>[N`N;L]
 \end{verbatim}
 The last group of parameters is required.  They are the source and
target nodes of the arrow and the label.  The remaining parameters are
optional and default to commonly used values.  Currently, the \verb+L+
is set in \verb+\scriptstyle+ size, but this can easily be changed by
putting \verb+\let\labelstyle=\textstyle+ in your file.

 The parameters \verb+x+ and \verb+y+ give the location of the source
node within a fixed local coordinate system and \verb-x+dx- and
\verb-y+dy- and locate the target.  To be precise, the first coordinate
is the horizontal center of the node and the second is that of the base
line.  These distances are given in terms of \verb+\ul+'s, (for
unitlength), which is user assignable, but currectly is .01em.  The
parameter \verb+placement+ is one of \verb+a,b,l,r,m+ that stand for
above, below, left, right, or mid and describe the positioning of the
arrow label on the arrow.  If it is given any value other than those
five, it is ignored.  We describe below why you might want to do this.
The label \verb+m+ stands for a label
positioned in the middle of a split arrow.  When used on a non-vertical
arrow, \verb+a+ positions the label above the arrow and \verb+b+
positions it below.  On a vertical arrow, the positioning depends on
whether the arrow points up or down.  Similarly, when used on a
non-horizontal arrow, \verb+l+ positions the label to the left and
\verb+r+ positions it to the right, while on a horizontal arrow it
depends on which way it points.

The \verb+shape+ describes the shape of the arrow.  An arrow is thought
of as consisting of three parts, the tail, the shaft and the head.  You
may specify just the head, in which case the shaft will be an ordinary
line, or all three.  However, since the tail can be (and usually is)
empty, in practice you can also describe the shaft and tail.  In
addition, it is possible to modify the arrow in various ways.  Although
the parameter is shown within braces, the braces can be omitted unless
one of the modifier characters is \verb+/+, in which case, {\em the
entire parameter} must be put in braces.  It is important to note that
it will not work just to put the \verb+/+ inside the braces, since this
will interfere with the internal parsing of \xypic.  The head and tail
shapes are basically one of \verb+>+, \verb+>>+, \verb+(+, \verb+)+,
\verb*+ >+, and \verb*+< +. Each of these may also be preceded by
\verb+^+ or \verb+_+ and others are user definable.  For details, see
the \xypic\ reference manual.  The first of these is an ordinary head,
while the second is for an epic arrow.  The third is not much used, but
the superscripted version makes and inclusion tail, as will be
illustrated below.  The reverse ones give reversed arrowheads.  The sign
\verb*+ + stands for an obligatory space and it leaves extra space for a
tailed (monic) arrow, which otherwise runs into the source node.
Although there are many possibilities for shafts, including alphanumeric
characters, there are basically three that interest us:  \verb+-+, which
is an ordinary shaft, \verb+--+, which produces a dashed arrow,
\verb+=+, which gives a double arrow (although with only one arrowhead),
and \verb+.+, which makes a dotted arrow.  Thus \verb+>+ or \verb+->+
will produce an ordinary arrow, \verb+->>+ an epic arrow, \verb*+ >->+
makes a monic arrow, and \verb+-->>+ would make a dashed epic arrow.
The descriptions \verb+<-, <<-,+ \verb*+<-< +, and \verb+<<--+ give the
reversed versions.  Note that \verb+<+ does not give a reversed arrow,
since \xypic\ interprets that as a reversed head, not a tail.

If the shape parameter begins with an \verb+@+, it is interpreted
differently.  In that case, it has the form \verb+@{shape}@+ modifier,
where the modifier is as described in the \xypic\ reference guide.  I
just mention a couple of them.  The parameter \verb+@{->}@<3pt>+, for
example, would give an ordinary arrow moved three points in the
direction perpendicular to that of the arrow.  If you give
\verb+{@{-->}@/^5pt/}+, you will get an epic arrow that is curved in the
direction perpendicular to the direction of the arrow by five points.
(As far as I can tell, there is no difference between \verb+^-5pt+ and
\verb+_5pt+ so the syntax could be simplified and made consistent with
that of \verb+<dimen>+ described above.)  It is imperative that a
specification such as \verb+@{>}@/5pt/+ be enclosed in braces because of
the \verb+/+s.

\subsection*{A word about parameters}
 I have already mentioned the necessity of enclosing certain arrow shape
specifications in braces.  Because of the way \TeX\ operates, I have
used a number of different delimiters:
 \verb+(, ), |, /, [, ], `, ;+.  Any of these that appear inside an
argument could conceivably cause problems.  They were chosen as the
least likely to appear inside mathematics (except for \verb+(,)+ which
appear in positions that are unlikely to cause problems).  However, be
warned that this is a possible cause of mysterious error messages.  If
this happens, enclosing the offending parameter in braces should cure
the problem.  The exceptions come when the braces interfere with
\xypic's somewhat arcane parsing mechanism.  One place I have found
it imperative to use braces is if you attempt to use a disk as
a tip.  According to the \xypic\ documentation, the tip * will give you
a disk as an arrowhead.  However, as I have discovered by experiment,
the first three of
\begin{verbatim}
\morphism(0,300)|a|/-*/<500,0>[A`B;f]
\morphism(0,0)|a|/{-*}/<500,0>[A`B;f]
\morphism(0,0)|a|/{*}/<500,0>[A`B;f]
\morphism(0,0)|a|/-{*}/<500,0>[A`B;f]
\end{verbatim}
 give only an error message.  Only the fourth works:
 $$\bfig
\morphism(0,0)|a|/-{*}/<500,0>[A`B;f]
 \efig$$
 This seems to be a feature of \xypic's parsing mechanism.

In addition to the diagrams, there are macros that are intended to be
used inline to make horizontal arrows, pointing left or right, plain,
monic, epic, or user-definable shapes, and calculating their own length
to fit the label.  Finally, there is a macro for making short 2-arrows
that may be placed (actually, \verb+\place+d) anywhere in a diagram.


\section*{Shapes}

Using the basic \verb+\morphism+ macro, I have a defined a number of
shapes, squares (really rectangles) and variously oriented triangles and
a few compound shapes.  The basic shapes are exactly the same as in the
old diagram package, but the options are done entirely differently.
Here is the syntax of the \verb+\square+ macro:
 \begin{verbatim}
 \square(x,y)|pppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N`N`N`N;L`L`L`L]
 \end{verbatim}
 Each of the first four sets of parameters is optional and any subset of
them can be omitted.  (Note that only the sets can be omitted, once you
give \verb+dx+, you also have to give \verb+dy+ and so on.)  The first
two describe the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the lower left
corner of the square, the next four give the label placements using the
same five characters previously described. The next four give the shapes
of
the arrows using the same syntax as discussed above.  The last group is
horizontal and vertical size of the square.  More precisely, the
\verb+x+ coordinate is that of the midpoint of the node, while the
\verb+y+ coordinate is that of the baseline of the node.  This is
entirely based on \xypic.

In the case of other shapes, discussed below, the positioning parameter
may be a bit different.  The \verb+x+ coordinate is the midpoint of the
leftmost node and the \verb+y+ coordinate is the baseline of the lowest
node.  In the case of the \verb+\qtriangle+, \verb+\Vtriangle+, and
\verb+\Ctriangle+ described below, these are
different nodes.  What this positioning means is that if you specify the
coordinates and sizes correctly the shapes will automatically fit
together. The last example on Page~\pageref{TTTdiag} illustrates this.

Here is a listing of the shapes, together with the groups of parameters.
In all cases, the first four groups are optional and any subset of them
will work.  However, they must come in the order given.  Note that the
names of the triangles are related to the shape as the shape that best
approximates the shape of the letter.  For example, a \verb+\ptriangle+
is a right triangle that has its hypotenuse going from upper right to
lower left.  Triangles with lower case names have their legs horizontal
and vertical and the dimension parameters are the lengths of the legs.
Those with capitalized names have their hypotenuse
horizontal or vertical.  In those cases, one of \verb+dx+ or \verb+dy+
is the length of a leg and the other is {\em half} the length of the
hypotenuse.  In all cases, the order of the nodes and of the arrows is
linguistic, first moving from left to right and then down.  The defaults
are reasonable, but with triangles, there is not always a natural
direction for arrows.  I always made mistakes in the order with my
macros and this is certainly a defect.  But the order is the same.  In
every case the braces around the shape specification can be removed
unless it includes the following delimiter (that is, \verb+`+ or
\verb+/+, as the case may be.)
 \begin{verbatim}
\square(x,y)|pppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>%
 [N`N`N`N;L`L`L`L]
\ptriangle(x,y)|ppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N`N`N;L`L`L]
\qtriangle(x,y)|ppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N`N`N;L`L`L]
\dtriangle(x,y)|ppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N`N`N;L`L`L]
\btriangle(x,y)|ppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N`N`N;L`L`L]
\Atriangle(x,y)|ppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N`N`N;L`L`L]
\Vtriangle(x,y)|ppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N`N`N;L`L`L]
\Ctriangle(x,y)|ppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N`N`N;L`L`L]
\Dtriangle(x,y)|ppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N`N`N;L`L`L]
\Atrianglepair(x,y)|ppppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/%
<dx,dy>[N`N`N`N;L`L`L`L`L]
\Vtrianglepair(x,y)|ppppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/%
<dx,dy>[N`N`N`N;L`L`L`L`L]
\Ctrianglepair(x,y)|ppppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/%
<dx,dy>[N`N`N`N;L`L`L`L`L]
\Dtrianglepair(x,y)|ppppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/%
<dx,dy>[N`N`N`N;L`L`L`L`L]
\end{verbatim}
Note that the \verb+%+ signs are required if you break the
macro at such points.  See also the discussion of errant spaces above.

To make a diagram, you have to enclose it inside \verb+\xy ... \endxy+.
You will almost always want it displayed, for which the simplest is to
enclose it in \verb+$$\xy ... \endxy$$+.  For old times' sake, I have
also let \verb+\bfig+ and \verb+\efig+ be synonyms for \verb+\xy+ and
\verb+\endxy+, resp.  (In case you wonder, these go all the back to a
main frame formatter running at McGill when Charles Wells and I were
first writing TTT, where \verb+.BFIG+ and \verb+.EFIG+ were used to make
displays, at least as far as that primitive formatter was capable of.)

\section{Examples}

Many people---including me--- learn mainly by example and
I will give a number of examples here.  The formal
syntax can be learned in the \xypic\ reference manual.  We begin with
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \morphism[A`B;f]
 \morphism(0,300)[A`B;f]
 \morphism(0,600)|m|[A`B;f]
 \morphism(0,900)/<-/[A`B;f]
 \morphism(900,500)<0,-500>[A`B;f]
 \morphism(1200,0)<0,500>[A`B;f]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
which gives the diagram
 $$\bfig
 \morphism[A`B;f]
 \morphism(0,300)[A`B;f]
 \morphism(0,600)|m|[A`B;f]
 \morphism(0,900)/<-/[A`B;f]
 \morphism(900,500)<0,-500>[A`B;f]
 \morphism(1200,0)<0,500>[A`B;f]
 \efig$$
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\square[A`B`C`D;e`f`g`m]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 produces
 $$\bfig
\square[A`B`C`D;e`f`g`m]
 \efig$$
 This can be modified, for example
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\square/>>`>`>` >->/[A`B`C`D;e`f`g`m]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 produces
 $$\bfig
\square/>>`>`>` >->/[A`B`C`D;e`f`g`m]
 \efig$$
 This can be put together with a morphism as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\square/>>`>`>` >->/[A`B`C`D;e`f`g`m]
 \morphism(500,500)|m|/.>/<-500,-500>[B`C;h]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 which makes a familiar diagram:
 $$\bfig
\square/>>`>`>` >->/[A`B`C`D;e`f`g`m]
 \morphism(500,500)|m|/.>/<-500,-500>[B`C;h]
 \efig$$
 The same diagram could have been made by
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \ptriangle|alm|/>>`>`.>/[A`B`C;e`f`h]
 \dtriangle/`>` >->/[B`C`D;`g`m]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}

There are four macros for making pairs of triangles put together:
 $$\bfig
 \Vtrianglepair[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k`l]
 \efig$$
 comes from
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \Vtrianglepair[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k`l]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}

 You can fit two squares together, horizontally:
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\square|almb|[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k]
\square(500,0)/>``>`>/[B`E`D`F;l``m`n]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\square|almb|[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k]
\square(500,0)/>``>`>/[B`E`D`F;l``m`n]
 \efig$$
 or vertically
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\square(0,500)|alrm|[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k]
\square/`>`>`>/[C`D`E`F;`l`m`n]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\square(0,500)|alrm|[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k]
\square/`>`>`>/[C`D`E`F;`l`m`n]
 \efig$$
or a square and a triangle
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\Ctriangle/<-`>`>/<400,400>[\hbox{\rm rec}(A,B)`B`X;r_0(A,B)`f`t_0]
 \square(400,0)/<-``>`<-/<1000,800>[\hbox{\rm rec}(A,B)`A\times\hbox{\rm
   rec}(A,B)`X`A\times X;r(A,B)``\hbox{\rm id}_A\times f`t]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 gives the diagram
 $$\bfig
\Ctriangle/<-`>`>/<400,400>[\hbox{\rm rec}(A,B)`B`X;r_0(A,B)`f`t_0]
 \square(400,0)/<-``>`<-/<1000,800>[\hbox{\rm rec}(A,B)`A\times\hbox{\rm
   rec}(A,B)`X`A\times X;r(A,B)``\hbox{\rm id}_A\times f`t]
 \efig$$
 This diagram is on page 361 of the third edition of Category Theory for
Computing Science to describe recursion.
 Here is an example using the procedure for sliding an arrow sideways.
This one could even be used in a text,
$\xy \morphism(0,0)|a|/@{>}@<3pt>/<400,0>[A`B;d]
\morphism(0,0)|b|/@{>}@<-3pt>/<400,0>[A`B;e]\endxy$
 which was made using
\begin{verbatim}
$\xy \morphism(0,0)|a|/@{>}@<3pt>/<400,0>[A`B;d]
\morphism(0,0)|b|/@{>}@<-3pt>/<400,0>[A`B;e]\endxy$
\end{verbatim}
 Indidentally, if you don't put this in math mode, the diagram will come
out too low, for reasons I do not understand but must be buried within
the \xypic\ code. This can be seen in an earlier version of thid
document.  Later we will introduce a number of inline procedures.

Something a bit different that illustrates the use of another shaft
\verb+=+ that gives a 2-arrow, as well as curved arrows:
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\morphism(0,0)|a|/{@{>}@/^1em/}/<500,0>[A`B;f]
\morphism(0,0)|b|/{@{>}@/_1em/}/<500,0>[A`B;g]
\morphism(250,50)|a|/=>/<0,-100>[``]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\morphism(0,0)|a|/{@{>}@/^1em/}/<500,0>[A`B;f]
\morphism(0,0)|b|/{@{>}@/_1em/}/<500,0>[A`B;g]
\morphism(250,50)|a|/=>/<0,-100>[`;]
 \efig$$
 In order to use curved arrows, you must insert \verb+\xyoption{curve}+
into your file. Here are two ways of doing three arrows between two
objects, depending on what you like:
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \morphism(0,0)|a|/@{>}@<5pt>/<500,0>[A`B;f]
 \morphism(0,0)|m|/@{>}/<500,0>[A`B;g]
 \morphism(0,0)|b|/@{>}@<-5pt>/<500,0>[A`B;h]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 which gives
 $$\bfig
 \morphism(0,0)|a|/@{>}@<5pt>/<500,0>[A`B;f]
 \morphism(0,0)|m|/@{>}/<500,0>[A`B;g]
 \morphism(0,0)|b|/@{>}@<-5pt>/<500,0>[A`B;h]
 \efig$$
and
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \morphism(0,0)|a|/{@{>}@/^5pt/}/<500,0>[A`B;f]
 \morphism(0,0)|m|/@{>}/<500,0>[A`B;g]
 \morphism(0,0)|b|/{@{>}@/^-5pt/}/<500,0>[A`B;h]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 which gives
 $$\bfig
 \morphism(0,0)|a|/{@{>}@/^5pt/}/<500,0>[A`B;f]
 \morphism(0,0)|m|/@{>}/<500,0>[A`B;g]
 \morphism(0,0)|b|/{@{>}@/^-5pt/}/<500,0>[A`B;h]
 \efig$$
 Either of these could also be used inline.

 There is a macro \verb+\place(x,y)[N]+ where \verb+N+
is any object that places that object anywhere.  I have changed the name
in order to avoid clashing with the \LaTeX\ picture mode's \verb+\put+.
Here is an example that uses a construction that is undocumented here,
but uses a documented \Xy\ construction:
\begin{verbatim}
\newbox\anglebox
\setbox\anglebox=\hbox{\xy \POS(75,0)\ar@{-} (0,0) \ar@{-} (75,75)\endxy}
 \def\angle{\copy\anglebox}
 $$\bfig
 \square[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k]
 \place(100,400)[\angle]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
\newbox\anglebox
\setbox\anglebox=\hbox{\xy \POS(75,0)\ar@{-} (0,0) \ar@{-} (75,75)\endxy}

 \def\angle{\copy\anglebox}
 $$\bfig
 \square[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k]
 \place(100,400)[\angle]
 \efig$$
 Notice that you get a headless arrow by using \verb+\ar@{-}+.

Here is a special code installed at the request of Jonathon Funk:
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\pullback|brrb|<800,800>[P`X`Y`Z;t`u`v`w]%
|amb|/>`-->`>/<500,500>[A;f`g`h]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\pullback|brrb|<800,800>[P`X`Y`Z;t`u`v`w]%
|amb|/>`-->`>/<500,500>[A;f`g`h]
 \efig$$
The full syntax for this is
\begin{verbatim}
\pullback(x,y)|pppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx`dy>[N`N`N`N;L`L`L]%
    |ppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N;L`L`L]
\end{verbatim}
 Of these only the nodes placed inside brackets are obligatory.  The
first sets of parameters are exactly as for \verb+\square+ and the
remaining parameters are for the nodes and labels of the outer arrows.
There is no positioning parameters for them; rather you set the
horizontal and vertical separations of the outer node from the square.

Here are some more special constructions.  In general, if you are doing
a square, you should use \verb+\Square+ instead of \verb+\square+
because if figures its own width.  The syntax is almost the same, except
that \verb+dx+ is omitted.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \Square/^{ (}->`>`>`^{ (}->/<350>[{\rm Hom}(A,2^B)`{\rm Sub}(A\times B)`
 {\rm Hom}(A',2^{B'})`{\rm Sub}(A'\times B');\alpha(A,B)```\alpha(A',B')]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 will produce the square
 $$\bfig
 \Square/^{ (}->`>`>`^{ (}->/<350>[{\rm Hom}(A,2^B)`{\rm Sub}(A\times B)`
 {\rm Hom}(A',2^{B'})`{\rm Sub}(A'\times B');\alpha(A,B)```\alpha(A',B')]
 \efig$$
 There are a couple of points to note here.  Note the use of the
argument \verb+^{ (}->+ to get the inclusion arrow.  The complication is
created by the necessity of adding a bit of extra space before the hook.
You get pretty much the same effect by putting a bit of extra space
after the node:
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \Square/^(->`>`>`^(->/<350>[{\rm Hom}(A,2^B)\,`{\rm Sub}(A\times B)`
 {\rm Hom}(A',2^{B'})\,`{\rm Sub}(A'\times
B');\alpha(A,B)```\alpha(A',B')]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 The full syntax is
\begin{verbatim}
 \Square(x,y)|pppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dy>[N`N`N`N;L`L`L`L]
\end{verbatim}

There are also macros for placing two \verb+\Square+s together
horizontally or vertically.  The first is \verb+\hSquares+ with the
syntax
\begin{verbatim}
\hSquares(x,y)|ppppppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/%
<dy>[N`N`N`N`N`N;L`L`L`L`L`L`L]
\end{verbatim}
The second is \verb+\vSquares+ with a similar syntex except that there
are two \verb+dy+ parameters, one for each square:
\begin{verbatim}
\hSquares(x,y)|ppppppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/%
<dy,dy>[N`N`N`N`N`N;L`L`L`L`L`L`L]
\end{verbatim}
 Similarly, there are four macros for making pairs of triangles put
together.  For example,
 $$\bfig
 \Vtrianglepair[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k`l]
 \efig$$
 comes from
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \Vtrianglepair[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k`l]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}

There is a macro for making cubes.  The syntax is
\begin{verbatim}
 \cube(x,y)|pppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N`N`N`N;L`L`L`L]%
      (x,y)|pppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/<dx,dy>[N`N`N`N;L`L`L`L]%
      |pppp|/{sh}`{sh}`{sh}`{sh}/[L`L`L`L]
\end{verbatim}
 The first line of parameters is for the outer square and the second for
the inner square, while the remaining parameters are for the arrows
between the squares.  Only the parameters in square brackets are
required; there are defaults for the others.  Here is an example:
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\cube(0,0)|arlb|/ >->` >->`>`>/<1500,1500>[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k]%
(300,300)|arlb|/>`>`>`>/<400,400>[A'`B'`C'`D';f'`g'`h'`k']%
 |mmmm|/<-`<-`<-`<-/[\alpha`\beta`\gamma`\delta]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 gives the somewhat misshapen diagram
 $$\bfig
\cube(0,0)|arlb|/ >->` >->`>`>/<1500,1500>[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k]%
(300,300)|arlb|/>`>`>`>/<400,400>[A'`B'`C'`D';f'`g'`h'`k']%
 |mmmm|/<-`<-`<-`<-/[\alpha`\beta`\gamma`\delta]
 \efig$$
 because the parameters were oddly chosen.  The defaults center the
squares.  I discovered accidently, while debugging the cube that what I
though was an out-of-range choice of parameters would produce an offset
cube:
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\cube|arlb|/ >->` >->`>`>/<1000,1000>[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k]%
(400,400)|arlb|/>`>`>`>/<900,900>[A'`B'`C'`D';f'`g'`h'`k']%
 |rrrr|/<-`<-`<-`<-/[\alpha`\beta`\gamma`\delta]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 gives
 $$\bfig
\cube|arlb|/ >->` >->`>`>/<1000,1000>[A`B`C`D;f`g`h`k]%
(400,400)|arlb|/>`>`>`>/<900,900>[A'`B'`C'`D';f'`g'`h'`k']%
 |r`r`r`r|/<-`<-`<-`<-/[\alpha`\beta`\gamma`\delta]
 \efig$$


In homological algebra one often has a $3\times3$ diagram, with or
without 0's on the margins.  There is a macro to do that:
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\iiixiii(0,0)|aammbblmrlmr|/>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>/<500,500>%

{'5436}<400,400>[A'`B'`C'`A`B`C`A''`B''`C'';f'`g'`f`g`f''`g''`u`v`w`u'`v'`w']
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 that gives
 $$\bfig
\iiixiii(0,0)|aammbblmrlmr|/>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>/<500,500>%

{'5436}<400,400>[A'`B'`C'`A`B`C`A''`B''`C'';f'`g'`f`g`f''`g''`u`v`w`u'`v'`w']
 \efig$$
 Here is the explanation.  The arrow parameters are not given in the
usual order, but rather first all the horizontal arrows and then all the
vertical ones, each in their usual order.  The nodes are given in the
usual order.  The fifth parameter is the octal number 5436 (In \TeX, the
\verb+'+ introduces octal numbers and \verb+"+ introduces hexadecimal
numbers) which corresponds to the binary number 101,100,011,110 that
describes the distribution of the 0's around the margins.  The same
results would have occurred if the number had been "B1E or the decimal
number 2846.  Note that the positioning parameters ignore the 0's so
that it is the lower left node that appears at the position
\verb.(x,y)..  As usual, there are defaults
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\iiixiii[A'`B'`C'`A`B`C`A''`B''`C'';f'`g'`f`g`f''`g''`u`v`w`u'`v'`w']
 \efig$$
 $$\bfig
\iiixiii%
 {'5436}[A'`B'`C'`A`B`C`A''`B''`C'';f'`g'`f`g`f''`g''`u`v`w`u'`v'`w']
 \efig$$
 $$\bfig
\iiixiii{'5436}<250,450>[A'`B'`C'`A`B`C`A''`B''`C'';%
f'`g'`f`g`f''`g''`u`v`w`u'`v'`w']
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 $$\bfig

 \efig$$
 $$\bfig
\iiixiii%
 {'5436}[A'`B'`C'`A`B`C`A''`B''`C'';f'`g'`f`g`f''`g''`u`v`w`u'`v'`w']
 \efig$$
 $$\bfig
\iiixiii{'5436}<250,450>[A'`B'`C'`A`B`C`A''`B''`C'';%
f'`g'`f`g`f''`g''`u`v`w`u'`v'`w']
 \efig$$




\subsection*{Empty placement and moving labels}
 The label placements within \verb+|p|+ is valid only for
 \verb+x = a,b,r,l,m+.  If you use any other value (or leave it empty)
the label entry is ignored, but you can use any valid \xypic\ label, as
described in Figure 13 of the reference manual.  One place you might
want to use this is for the placement of the labels along an arrow.  In
\xypic\ the default placement of the label is midway between the
midpoints of the nodes.  If the two nodes are of widely different sizes,
this can result in strange placements; therefore I always place them
midway along the arrow.  However, as the following illustrates, this can
be changed.
 \begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\morphism(0,900)||/@{->}^<>(0.7){f}/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
\morphism(0,600)||/@{->}^<(0.7){f}/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
\morphism(0,300)||/@{->}^>(0.7){f}/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
\morphism(0,0)||/@{->}^(0.7){f}/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 which produces
 $$\bfig
\morphism(0,900)||/@{->}^<>(0.7){f}/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
\morphism(0,600)||/@{->}^<(0.7){f}/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
\morphism(0,300)||/@{->}^>(0.7){f}/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
\morphism(0,0)||/@{->}^(0.7){f}/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
 \efig$$
Here is the explanation.  The label placement argument is empty (it
cannot be omitted) and the arrow entry is empty.  However, placing
 \verb+^(0.7){f}+ inside the arrow shape places the label \verb+f+ 7/10
of the way between the nodes.  Unmodified, this places it 7/10 of the
way between the centers of the nodes.  This may be modified by \verb+<+,
which moves the first (here the left) reference point to the beginning
of the arrow, \verb+>+ which moves the second reference point to the end
of the arrow, or by both, which moves both reference points.  In most
cases, you will want both.  Incidentally, \verb+-+ is a synonym for the
sequence \verb+<>(.5)+ and that is the default placement in my package.

Here are some more examples that illustrates the special sequence
 \verb+\hole+ used in conjunction with \verb+|+ that implements
\verb+m+ as well as the fact that these things can be stacked.  For more
details, I must refer you to the reference manual.
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\morphism(0,600)||/@{->}|-\hole/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
\morphism(0,300)||/@{->}|-\hole^<>(.7)f/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
\morphism(0,0)||/@{->}|-\hole^<>(.7)f_<>(.3)g/<800,0>[A^B\times
B^C\times C`C;]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 produces
 $$\bfig
\morphism(0,600)||/@{->}|-\hole/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
\morphism(0,300)||/@{->}|-\hole^<>(.7)f/<800,0>[A^B\times B^C\times C`C;]
\morphism(0,0)||/@{->}|-\hole^<>(.7)f_<>(.3)g/<800,0>[A^B\times
B^C\times C`C;]
 \efig$$

Here is another version of the cube we looked at above, using these
special placements and \verb+\hole+'s to break some lines and make it
neater.
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\cube|arlb|/@{ >->}^<>(.6){f}` >->`@{>}_<>(.4){h}`>/%
<1000,1000>[A`B`C`D;`g``k]%
(400,400)|axxb|/>`@{>}|(.33)\hole^<>(.6){g'}`>`@{>}%
|(.67)\hole_<>(.4){k'}/<900,900>[A'`B'`C'`D';f'``h'`]%
 |rrrr|/<-`<-`<-`<-/[\alpha`\beta`\gamma`\delta]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\cube|arlb|/@{ >->}^<>(.6){f}` >->`@{>}_<>(.4){h}`>/%
<1000,1000>[A`B`C`D;`g``k]%
(400,400)|axl|/>`@{>}|(.33)\hole^<>(.6){g'}`>`%
@{>}|(.67)\hole_<>(.4){k'}/<900,900>[A'`B'`C'`D';f'``h'`]%
 |rrrr|/<-`<-`<-`<-/[\alpha`\beta`\gamma`\delta]
 \efig$$
This one is probably worth saving as a template.  Note that the
\verb+\hole+'s by reference to the center of the nodes.  That way they
will always miss hitting the arrows no matter what the size of the node.
If the nodes are unusually large, the cube may be magnified using
 \verb+\scalefactor+.

\subsection*{Inline macros}
 Here we illustrate a few of the macros for inline---or
displayed---equations the package contains.  In each case, the macro may
have a superscript or subscript or both (in which case the superscript
must come first) and the arrow(s) grow long enough to hold the super- or
subscript.  If you type\par\noindent
 \verb+$A\to B\to^f C\to_g D\to^h_{{\rm Hom}(X,Y)} E$+, you get
 $A\to B\to^f C\to_g D\to^h_{{\rm Hom}(X,Y)} E$.  Similarly, the macro
 \verb+\toleft+ reverses the arrows.  The remaining macros of this sort
are \verb+\mon+ which gives a monic arrow, \verb+\epi+ which gives an
epic arrow, \verb+\two+ that gives a pair of arrows, as well as
leftwards pointing versions, \verb+\monleft+, \verb+\epileft+, and
\verb+twoleft+ of each of them.  Here is one more
example:
\begin{verbatim}
 $A\twoleft B\twoleft^f C\twoleft_g D\twoleft^h_{{\rm Hom}(X,Y)} E$
\end{verbatim}
 gives  $A\twoleft B\twoleft^f C\twoleft_g D\twoleft^h_{{\rm Hom}(X,Y)}
E$.

There is an almost unlimited variety of such procedures possible.  The
ones that are provided can be used as templates to define new ones with,
say, curved arrows or three arrows or whatever a user might have need
of.

\subsection*{2-arrows}
 There is a macro for making 2-arrows of a fixed size, but varying
orientation.  They should be put at the appropriate position in a
diagram.  The two parameters are two integers \verb+dx+ and \verb+dy+
whose ratio is the slope of the arrow.  They need not be relatively
prime, but arithmetic overflow could occur if they are too large.  Note
that although \verb+(dx,dy)+ and \verb+(-dx,-dy)+ describe the same
slope, the arrows point in opposite directions.   Here is a sampler
 \begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \place(0,0)[\twoar(1,0)]
 \place(200,0)[\twoar(0,1)]
 \place(400,0)[\twoar(1,1)]
 \place(600,0)[\twoar(0,-1)]
 \place(800,0)[\twoar(1,2)]
 \place(1000,0)[\twoar(1,3)]
 \place(1200,0)[\twoar(1,-3)]
 \place(1400,0)[\twoar(-3,1)]
 \place(1600,0)[\twoar(-1,-3)]
 \place(1800,0)[\twoar(255,77)]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \place(0,0)[\twoar(1,0)]
 \place(200,0)[\twoar(0,1)]
 \place(400,0)[\twoar(1,1)]
 \place(600,0)[\twoar(0,-1)]
 \place(800,0)[\twoar(1,2)]
 \place(1000,0)[\twoar(1,3)]
 \place(1200,0)[\twoar(1,-3)]
 \place(1400,0)[\twoar(-3,1)]
 \place(1600,0)[\twoar(-1,-3)]
 \place(1800,0)[\twoar(255,77)]
 \efig$$

Here is little amusement.
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \square/@3{->}`~)`=o`--x/[A`B`C`D;```]
 \place(400,100)[\twoar(-1,-1)]
 \place(100,400)[\twoar(1,1)]
 \morphism(500,500)||/{*}.{*}/<-500,-500>[B`C;]
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \square/@3{->}`~)`=o`--x/[A`B`C`D;```]
 \place(400,100)[\twoar(-1,-1)]
 \place(100,400)[\twoar(1,1)]
 \morphism(500,500)||/{*}.{*}/<-500,-500>[B`C;]
 \efig$$




\subsection*{Diagram from TTT}
 The last example is a complicated diagram from TTT.  If you have the
documentation from the old diagram macros (or the errata from TTT), you
can see how much easier it is to describe this diagram with these
macros.  Note the use of \verb+\scalefactor+ to change the default
length from 500 to 700 that made it unnecessary to specify the scales on
the squares and triangles.
 \begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
 \scalefactor{1.4}%
 \qtriangle(0,1000)/>`>`/[TT`T`TTT';\mu`TT\eta'`]%

With a little bit of cheating, you can use domain theory to express
the limit as a sequence as a _colimit_ in a partially ordered set.

Let D be the partial order consisting of all the closed intervals,
including singletons [a,a], ordered by reverse inclusion. We can
embed R into D by mapping it to the maximal elements a |---> [a,a],
and under a suitable topology on D (the Scott topology), this is
a topological embedding--purists may want to throw in R as the
smallest element to obtain an honest continuous domain.

Let x_i be a Cauchy sequence of real numbers. To say that x_i is a
Cauchy sequence is to say that there exist numbers d_i such that

(1) For j >= i, the interval [x_i - d_i, x_i + d_i]
    contains [x_j + d_j, x_j + d_j].

(2) The numbers d_i become arbitrarily small: for every k
    there is i such that for all j >= i, d_i < 1/k.

(Exercise for your students: show that this is equivalent to the usual
definition of Cauchy sequence.)

In terms of the partial order D, (1) says that the intervals
[x_i - d_i, x_i + d_i] form an increasing sequence. Every increasing
sequence in D has a supremum, because an intersection of a nested
sequence of closed intervals is a closed interval, so let

    [u,v] = sup_i [x_i - d_i, x_i + d_i]

By (2), we get that u = v, and we have obtained the limit of the
sequence (x_i) as a supremum. Supremums are the _colimits_ in a
partial order. If you prefer limits, you can stand on your head.

I do not see how to get by without using the _evidence_ that (x_i) is
a Cauchy sequence, i.e., the numbers d_i. This is intuitionistic
mathematics creeping in, which is just as well.

I am way too young to know the answer to this.

Tobias Schroeder asks:

- Can the limit of a sequence of real numbers be expressed
  as a categorical limit (of course it can if the sequence is
  monotone, but what if it is not)?

A good question. I have no answer, only a similar (and ancient)
question: is there a setting in which adjoint operators on Hilbert
spaces can be seen to be examples of adjoint functors between
categories?

As for his second question:

- Why have people chosen the term "limit" in category theory?
  (And, by the way, who has defined it first?)

In the beginning, the only diagrams that had limits were "nets", that
is, diagrams based on directed posets. I believe it was Norman
Steenrod in his dissertation who first used the term. Before his
dissertation the Cech cohomology of a space was defined only as the
numberical invarients that arose as a limit of a directed set of such
invariants. It was Steenrod who perceived that Cech cohomology could
be defined as an abelian group. For that he needed to invent the
notion of a limit of a directed diagram of groups.

In the 50s the fact that one didn't need the diagram to be directed
was considered startling.

At least two of us tried to avoid the word "limit" in this more
general setting. Jim Lambek was pushing "inf" and "sup", a suggestion
I wish I had heard. Not having heard it, I was pushing "left root" and
"right root" (one was, after all, supplying a root to a generalized
tree. sort of).

All to no avail. So now we have "finite limits" and "finitely
continuous".

I think I have an answer to this question (without cheating). It may
be well known or wrong (I haven't carefully checked the details, but I
believe that they are correct).

Given a metric space X with distance function d, construct a category,
also called X, as follows. The objects of the category X are the
points of the space X. An element of the hom-set X(x,y) is a triple
(r,x,y) with r a real number such that d(x,y)<=r. The composite of the
arrows r:x->y and s:y->z is the arrow s+r:x->z. This is well defined
by virtue of the triangle inequality d(x,z)<=d(x,y)+d(y,z). By virtue
of the condition d(x,x)=0, we have identities. Notice that all arrows
are mono.

Of course, because the category X is small and it is not a preordered
set, it doesn't have all limits. But some limits do exist.

CLAIM: Let x_n be a sequence of points of X, and, for each n, let the
arrow r_n:x_{n+1}->x_n be d(x_n,x_{n+1}). If the sum of r_k over k>=0
exists, then this omega^op-diagram has a categorical limit. The source
of the limiting cone is the metric limit l of the sequence. The
projection p_n:l->x_n is the sum of r_k over k>=n. If q_n:m->x_n is
another cone, then the mediating map u:l->m exists (and will be
automatically unique), because, by definition of cone and of our
category, q_n will have to be bigger than r_n, and then u=q_n-r_n does
the job.

Remarks. (1) For any given Cauchy sequence, one can construct an
equivalent Cauchy sequence for which the assumption in the second
sentence of the claim fails. Using classical logic, for any given
Cauchy sequence, one can construct an equivalent Cauchy sequence for
which the assumption holds.  

(2) In (some flavours of) constructive mathematics, the notion of a
Cauchy sequence "with fixed rate of convergence" is taken as
basic. This often is taken to mean that d(x_n,x_n+1)<=c^n for a fixed
c with 0<c<1. For such sequences, the assumption is satisfied. Recall
that a map f:X->Y is called non-expansive if d(fx,fx')<=d(x,x'). If
the natural numbers are metrized by d(m,n)=c^min(m,n) for m/=n, to get
a space N, then such a Cauchy sequence is just a non-expansive map
N->X. It converges if and only if the non-expansive map has a
non-expansive extension to N_{infty}, the metric completion of N
(which, topologically, is the one-point compactification of N). And
non-expansive maps are functors---see (3) below.

(3) Recall that a map f:X->Y is called lipschitz if there is a
constant c for which d(fx,fx')<=c.d(x,x').  A lipschitz map f:X->Y
gives rise to a functor f:X->Y defined by
f(r:x->x')=c.r:f(r)->f(x'). That is, the object part is given by the
map itself, and the arrow part is given by multiplication with the
lipschitz coefficient.

(4) We have taken the arrows r_n to be d(x_n,x_{n+1}). But actually
any choice of arrows does the job, provided the sum of r_k over k>=0
is finite.

(5) Other two conditions for the distance function of a metric space,
which were not used in the definition of the category X, are (i)
d(x,y)=0 implies x=y, and (ii) d(x,y)=d(y,x). By the first, our
category is skeletal. By the second, it is selfdual. Of course, people
have considered generalized metric spaces in which these are not
assumed to hold. See, for example, Lawvere's paper "Metric spaces,
generalized logic, and closed categories", in which he regards a
generalized metric space X as an enriched category with X(x,y)=d(x,y)
(so he has hom-numbers instead of hom-sets). Here we have hom-sets (of
numbers).

Dear Colleagues,

I've recently come across a result in elementary topos theory which
looks as if it ought to be well known, but which I've never seen
before. So I'm writing to ask whether anyone else knows about it.

The context for the result is as follows: given a geometric morphism
f: E' --> E and a local operator (or Lawvere--Tierney topology, if
you prefer) j on E, it's well known that one can construct a local
operator j' on E' such that

       sh_j'(E') -----> sh_j(E)
           |               |
           |               |
           v       f       v
           E' -----------> E

is a pullback. To do this, let J >--> \Omega be the subobject
classified by j, and form the smallest local operator j' for which
the corresponding J' contains the image of

       f^*J >--> f^*\Omega ---> \Omega'

(the second factor being the canonical comparison map, which
classifies f^*(true)). See "Topos Theory", Example 3.59(iii).

The result in question is that, for any f and J, the object J' is
simply the upward closure in \Omega' of the image of the above
composite; equivalently, that the classifying map of the upward
closure of the image is always a local operator (in particular, that
it's idempotent).

When I first came across evidence that this might be true, a couple
of months ago, I was inclined to disbelieve it, on the grounds that
if it were true we'd surely have known it for twenty years or so.
However ... I now have (separate, and completely different) proofs
that it holds in several particular cases, including the case in
which f is an open map, and that in which f is a closed inclusion.
But it's also clear that the class of f's for which it holds is
closed under composition, and using Artin glueing one can factor any
f as a closed inclusion followed by an open map; so it's true for all f.

Has anyone seen this result before? In particular, does anyone have a
"uniform" proof of it that works for all f? If so, please let me know.

Peter Johnstone

the view of (quasi)metric spaces as R+-categories with the hom-objects
d(x,y) goes back to lawvere's "metric spaces, generalized logic and
closed categories" from 1973. the cauchy completeness of a space was
identified with what came to be known as the cauchy completeness of the
corresponding category (see kelly's book on enriched categories, or
francis borceux handbook). and cauchy completeness of a category amounts
to the existence of certain absolute (co)limits: eg over Set, Ab, Cat...
to splitting idempotents (which can be done by taking (co)equalizers with
id).

|A good question. I have no answer, only a similar (and ancient)
|question: is there a setting in which adjoint operators on Hilbert

i may as well state the obvious (not necesarily right) answer to this:
no, not quite.  rather, what seems to be going on is that the
phenomenon of adjoint linear operators is, in yetter's terminology, a
sort of decategorification of the phenomenon of adjoint functors.
decategorification is generally a somewhat destructive process,
destroying the morphisms between objects, and since the morphisms are
so intrinsic to the definition of adjoint functor it seems too much to
hope for that the decategorified phenomenon of adjoint linear
operators could actually qualify as a special case of adjoint
functors.  there are suggestive indications, though, that all of the
really interesting special cases of adjoint linear operators in
physics, for example, are decategorifications of interesting pairs of
adjoint functors.  (for example so-called "creation and annihilation
operators on fock space" have categorified analogs that live on a
categorified analog of fock space whose objects/vectors are something
like joyal's "species of structure".)

so roughly: the general phenomenon of adjoint linear operators is
technically probably not quite a genuine special case of adjoint
functors.  the actual interesting special cases of adjoint linear
operators, however, are often seen to be mere shadows of more
interesting cases of adjoint functors.

Good morning, y'all:

I really need some help in setting up a reading course. The course is
for computer science majors and faculty who are very interested and
motivated but lack a strong background in mathematics. The goal the
group has is to be able to read the denotational semantics
literature. Now, as you know, this is quite an undertaking.

How can I quickly give them some background? My first thought is to
tie categorical concepts to something they all might know. Is there an
article, book, or sequence of same that takes a less than formal
approach to concepts and then comes back with the formality? I call
this a "rosetta stone" approach. I've read Pierce's *Basic Category
Theory for Computer Scientists*. What I think I need is something that
would serve as an introduction (to even Pierce) as to why computer
scientists should want to know about pushouts, pullbacks, and some of
the other structures that don't seen to be obviously necessary.

Any guidance would be gratefully accepted!

best regards,
steve

I have discovered that a blank line in version 3 of the diagram
documentation that I sent out the other day has caused errors.  Here is
the correct paragraph:
In homological algebra one often has a $3\times3$ diagram, with or
without 0's on the margins.  There is a macro to do that:
\begin{verbatim}
 $$\bfig
\iiixiii(0,0)|aammbblmrlmr|/>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>/<500,500>%
{'5436}<400,400>[A'`B'`C'`A`B`C`A''`B''`C'';f'`g'`f`g`f''`g''`u`v`w`u'`v'`w']
 \efig$$
\end{verbatim}
 that gives
 $$\bfig
\iiixiii(0,0)|aammbblmrlmr|/>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>`>/<500,500>%
{'5436}<400,400>[A'`B'`C'`A`B`C`A''`B''`C'';f'`g'`f`g`f''`g''`u`v`w`u'`v'`w']
 \efig$$

Sorry about that.

now that i think about i guess it was crane rather than yetter who

is it correct that lawvere and schanuel use the term "objectification"
(or something like that) to mean pretty much the same thing as what
crane meant by "categorification"?  i think i might actually prefer
"objectification" here but i mostly hang out near sub-communities
where "categorification" has caught on to a certain extent.

I very much agree with James Dolan's response to the question of 
comparing categorical limits and adjoint functors with their abstract 
counterparts in analysis.

Other words that have been used for "objectification" and 
"categorification" are "laxification" and "identity breaking".

The original questions were a bit like asking: "Is the plus in an 
abelian group a categorical coproduct?"  Lots of abelian groups can 
arise by taking isomorphism classes and using a categorical 
coproduct: but then we lose the beautiful universal property.

Along the same lines, I enjoy bicategories, with coproducts in their 
homcategories (preserved by composition), much more than additive 
categories. Not only is every global coproduct in such a bicategory 
also a global product, but the projections from the global products 
are right adjoint to the coprojections into the coproduct.

Title : Investigating The Algebraic Structure of Dihomotopy Types

Abstract : 
  This presentation is the sequel of a paper published in GETCO'00
  proceedings where a research program to construct an appropriate
  algebraic setting for the study of deformations of higher
  dimensional automata was sketched. This paper will be focused
  precisely on detailing some of its aspects. The main idea is that
  the category of homotopy types can be embedded in a new category of
  dihomotopy types, the embedding being realized by the Globe functor.
  In this latter category, isomorphism classes of objects are exactly
  higher dimensional automata up to deformations leaving invariant
  their computer scientific properties as presence or not of deadlocks
  (or everything similar or related). Some hints to study the
  algebraic structure of dihomotopy types are given, in particular a
  rule to decide whether a statement/notion concerning dihomotopy
  types is or not the lifting of another statement/notion concerning
  homotopy types. This rule does not enable to guess what is the
  lifting of a given notion/statement, it only enables to make the
  verification, once the lifting has been found.

75th PSSL - First announcement

The 75th meeting of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic 
will be held at the Institut Mittag-Leffler, Stockholm,
on the week-end of 9-10 June 2001. As usual, we invite 
contributions from anyone interested in the application of 
categorical and sheaf theoretic methods in logic and related areas.

If you wish to attend, please complete the attached registration form
and return it to kock@ml.kva.se or palmgren@math.uu.se as soon as 
possible, and in any case before the end of May. The number of
participants is for physical reasons limited to 30

Further information and a provisional programme will be circulated
about a week before the meeting.

The meeting may be seen as  a satelitte event of the Logic Year,
which is taking place at the Mittag-Leffler Institute; 
a number of colleagues with interest in Sheaves and Logic are 
scheduled to be present in Stockholm during the period, in the 
context of the Logic Year.

The category of finite sets and isomorphisms versus the category with
objects
1,2,...,n,... and the symmetric groups \Sigma_n as morphisms

The category of `modules' over one is equivalent to
The category of `modules' over the other

Is this somewhere in the literature or just folk lore?
Maybe for one n at a time??

Connected Functors

Peter Johnstone has asked during the last PSSL for a characterization of
functors  p: E -> B which are "connected" in the sense that the functor
Set^B -> Set^E of composition with  p  is fully faithful. We have found
two necesary and sufficient conditions; in the following  E  and  B  are
arbitrary small categories.

Theorem 1. A functor p: E -> B is connected iff every object  X  of  B  is
an absolute limit of the diagram of all arrows X -> p(Z) for  Z  ranging
through  E .

Theorem 2. A functor  p: E -> B is connected iff for every morphism
x: X -> X' of  B  the category of all factorizations of  x  through
objects of  p[E]  is connected.

More precisely, in Thm 1 we form the diagram of all arrows  X -> p(Z)
and all E-morphisms whose p-image forms a commutative triangle in  B. 
Then  X  is equipped with a canonical cone of that diagram; this
cone is requested to be an absolute limit.
In Thm 2 we consider the category of all triples (Z,q,m) where  Z  is an
object of  E  and  m,q  are morphisms of  B  with  x = q.m (and morphisms
between these triples are the E-morphisms whose p-images form two
commutative triangles in  B ). Connectedness of that category has been,
for the case of  x = id , observed as a necessary condition by Peter.

Dear Steve,

My first hurried thoughts recall two books: that of Bob Walters,
`Categories and Computer Science' (Cambridge University Press, 1991) and
that of Lawvere-Schanuel's course at Buffalo, `Conceptual Mathematics: a
First Introduction to Categories' (CUP, 1997).

Max.

The final version is available as a diagxy.zip from 
ftp.math.mcgill.ca
by anonymous ftp in pub/barr/.  This includes the diagxy.tex and
diaxydoc.tex.  The former differs from the third version only in trivial
ways (some extra \ignorespaces were added to try to prevent extraneous
spaces from causing problems).  The opening pages of the documentation
are different, but the examples are all the same.

Recently I stumbled on the following: I find it hard to believe that
they are not well-known facts.  I would be grateful for references ...

(a) The conditions for the Kleisli category of a monoidal monad to be 
    closed (left/right) w.r.t the induced tensor when the original
    category is (left/right) closed.

(b) The fact that, in the above situation, when the monad is idempotent
    the Kleisli category is always closed.

With thanks in advance

probably not, but the they seem to be instances of the same general
structure. (it is simple, pretty old, and i am sure many have noticed it,
but since no one mentioned it, here it goes.)

let U :   Cat     ---> CAT be the embedding of small categories in all,
and
let Y: Cat^op ---> CAT map each small category A to the presheaves
Psh(A).

now look at the (pseudo)comma category U/Y. each category A is
represented in it by the yoneda embedding A-->Psh(A). the morphisms
between A-->Psh(A) and B --> Psh(B) are exactly the pairs of adjoint
functors between A and B.

on the other hand, let I: Vec---> Vec be the identity functor,
and let * : Vec^op ---> Vec take a vector space V to its dual V*.

look at the comma category I/*. each hilbert space V is represented in it
by the obvious linear map  V-->V*. the morphisms between V-->V* and
W-->W* are exactly the adjoint pairs of operators between V and W.

playing around a bit, these two comma categories can be thought of as
Chu(CAT,Set) and Chu(Vec,R) respectively. so both sorts of adjunctions
are the instances of the chu morphisms. they are the chu morphisms on the
"representation" objects, in the form X --> R^X, where R is the dualizing
object.

-- dusko

PS infact, one could start from Chu(SET,Set), and define categories as
the profunctors A-->Set^A which form a monoid with respect to the
profunctor composition. you'd get only the object part of the adjoint
functors as the morphisms of this chu, but the arrow part follows from
the adjunction (i think).

now can we characterize hilbert spaces in a similar way within
Chu(Vec,R)? this seems to be a completely different kind of question. in
particular, it is possible to define "profunctors" with respect to R or
C, like we did with respect to Set, and we can compose them, but hilbert
spaces do not seem to be monoids with respect to this composition, at
least the way it occurs to me. if there is no such composition that they
are, then hilbert spaces are like R-enriched graphs, rather than
categories.

Assume that V is a symmetric monoidal closed category and that A and B are 
categories enriched over V which have tensors.  Let me denote the tensor of 
an object v of V and an object a of A by

v \ten a

Assume also that F is a functor from the underlying ordinary category A_0 
of A to the underlying category B_0 of B.  If F were enriched over V, then 
there would be a natural map

f : v \ten Fa --> F(v \ten a)

describing the behavior of F on tensors.

However, assume only that F is a functor on the underlying categories.  It 
seems to me that, if there is a well-behaved natural map f of the above 
form for all v in V and a in A, then F ought to be enriched over V.  It is 
easy to construct from f the map that ought to be the enrichment for 
F.  The trick is to decide what properties f must have in order to ensure 
that the putative enrichment really works.  Is this written up somewhere?

Along the same lines, suppose now that F and G are enriched functors from A 
to B with the associated maps

f : v \ten Fa --> F(v \ten a)

and

g : v \ten Ga --> G(v \ten a)

describing their behavior on tensors.  Assume also that t is an ordinary 
natural tranformation between the ordinary functors F_0 and G_0 underlying 
F and G.  There is an obvious diagram relating t, f, and g, and it seems 
that this diagram ought to commute if t is an enriched natural 
transformation.  In fact, it seems that the commutativity of this diagram 
ought to be equivalent to t being enriched over V.  Is this written down 
anywhere?

Thanks for any help on this,
Gaunce

16h,  SALLE U ou V, étage -2 ,  Dépts. de Math. et d'Informatique, ENS, 45,
Rue D'Ulm,  75005  Paris:

ABSTRACT

One definition of  Higher Dimensional Algebra is that it is about
algebraic structures whose operations are partially defined under
geometric conditions, and whose axioms are defined by the geometry
- so for example one considers composing squares and cubes in
various directions. This allows for a more detailed transition
from geometry to algebra. One overall aim is to provide new tools
for local-to-global problems by the procedure `algebraic inverses
to subdivision'. The pursuit of this aim has led to a range of new
algebraic structures, new understanding and computations in
algebraic topology, as well as new tools for concurrency problems.
Its potential relevance to this seminar is the speculative idea
that a mathematics `on a line' cannot be adequate for describing
the complex modular and hierarchical interactions of the brain. So
Higher Dimensional Algebra can perhaps open out new modelling
possibilities for future development. For more background, see
http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/hdaweb2.htm

The structure of the talk will be
 1. Origins and intuitions
 2. Landmark theorems: these are of the type
    (a) equivalent descriptions of the algebraic structures
    (b) gluing (colimit) theorems
    (c) realisation of algebra by spaces
 3. Computational issues
 4. The future?

 (The aim is to give an impression of this area for a more general
 audience, and so consideration of `weak structures' and many other
 applications will be omitted.)

P.J.W. Hofstra and J. van Oosten,

Ordered PCA's and Realizability Toposes

http://www.math.uu.nl/people/jvoosten/papers.html

Abstract:

The concept of Ordered PCA (Partial Combinatory Algebra)
is defined; it is a generalization of ordinary PCA's.
The construction of Realizability Toposes for OPCA's is
straightforward.
Two 2-categories OPCA and OPCA+ are defined, OPCA+ being
a lluf subcategory of OPCA. Both have a 2-monad I on them.
It is shown that the category of realizability triposes
over opca's with Set-indexed exact functors is equivalent
to the Kleisli category of I on OPCA, whereas the category
of realizabiloity triposes with geometric morphisms is the
Kleisli category for I on OPCA+. This extends and analyzes
results in the theses of Pitts and Longley.
As an application we obtain an elegant tripos presentation
of Menni's chain of toposes, constructed as exact
completions.

The following paper is available at
http://www.math.yorku.ca/Who/Faculty/Tholen/research.html

J.Rosicky and W.Tholen, Left-determined model categories and universal
homotopy theories

Abstract:
We say that a model category is left-determined if the weak
equivalences are generated (in a suitable sense) by the
cofibrations. While the model category of simplicial sets is not
left-determined, we show that its non-oriented variant, the
category of symmetric simplicial sets (in the sense of Lawvere
and Grandis) carries a natural left-determined model category
structure. This is used to give another and, as we believe,
simpler proof of a recent result of D. Dugger about universal
homotopy theories.

I once answered a similar question.
In 1974 or 1975, I published a paper "Adjoint functors induced by adjoint
linear transformations"  in the Proceedings of the AMS.
The idea is that a pair of adjoint linear transformations between two
linear topological vectorspaces, e.g., a special case is Hilbert spaces,
naturally map to an adjoint pair of functors between the categories which
are the lattices of closed subspaces, i.e., a galois connection.

probably not, but the they seem to be instances of the same general
structure. (it is simple, pretty old, and i am sure many have noticed it,
but since no one mentioned it, here it goes.)

let U :   Cat     ---> CAT be the embedding of small categories in all,
and
let Y: Cat^op ---> CAT map each small category A to the presheaves
Psh(A).

now look at the (pseudo)comma category U/Y. each category A is
represented in it by the yoneda embedding A-->Psh(A). the morphisms
between A-->Psh(A) and B --> Psh(B) are exactly the pairs of adjoint
functors between A and B.

on the other hand, let I: Vec---> Vec be the identity functor,
and let * : Vec^op ---> Vec take a vector space V to its dual V*.

look at the comma category I/*. each hilbert space V is represented in it
by the obvious linear map  V-->V*. the morphisms between V-->V* and
W-->W* are exactly the adjoint pairs of operators between V and W.

playing around a bit, these two comma categories can be thought of as
Chu(CAT,Set) and Chu(Vec,R) respectively. so both sorts of adjunctions
are the instances of the chu morphisms. they are the chu morphisms on the
"representation" objects, in the form X --> R^X, where R is the dualizing
object.

-- dusko

PS infact, one could start from Chu(SET,Set), and define categories as
the profunctors A-->Set^A which form a monoid with respect to the
profunctor composition. you'd get only the object part of the adjoint
functors as the morphisms of this chu, but the arrow part follows from
the adjunction (i think).

now can we characterize hilbert spaces in a similar way within
Chu(Vec,R)? this seems to be a completely different kind of question. in
particular, it is possible to define "profunctors" with respect to R or
C, like we did with respect to Set, and we can compose them, but hilbert
spaces do not seem to be monoids with respect to this composition, at
least the way it occurs to me. if there is no such composition that they
are, then hilbert spaces are like R-enriched graphs, rather than
categories.

A review of a paper I submitted to a neural network journal is taking awhile.  
In the meantime, for anyone who might be interested, there is a conference 
paper online with an overview of the content.  It concerns a proposed 
mathematical semantic model for neural networks:

M. J. Healy (2000)
"Category Theory Applied to Neural Modeling and Graphical Representations", 
Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 
(IJCNN2000), Como, Italy.

It's available at  http://cialab.ee.washington.edu/ .  Click on 
"Publications", then "Selected Publications", and scroll down.  The same site 
has a paper on topological semantics, the other part of the proposed model.  
Developing and applying it is a major part of my work right now, so I 
would welcome comments from anyone who might be interested.

Regards,
Mike Healy

Hello,
I've sent the following message to sci.math, but haven't
received a clear answer. I've also tried sci.math.research,
but the moderator bounced the posting. Possibly someone 
here can help?

Derek.
===============================================

I'm working through the following paper, trying to learn a bit
more about category theory:

Matrices, Monads and the Fast Fourier Transform
http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/jay93matrice.html

I this paper, the author explains vectors in categorical
notation:

"Vectors are distinguished from lists because their length
is given as part of their structure, represented by a morphism
(function) #: VA -> N."

What this means is that the morphism '#' will produce the
length of vector.

However, does this violate one of the requirements that a
morphism must preserve the structure of an object?  A vector
is a sequence of elements, and an integer is only a single
value. Does this mean that an integer has the same structure
as a vector?

Or does "structure preserving morphism" mean something
different?

Thanks,

Derek.

The function # should not have been referred to as a morphism.  It is an
operation.  Operations must be preserved by morphisms, but operations need not
be morphisms themselves.  (In fact a distributive law is a statement that some
operation is a morphism with respect to another operation.)

Dear Category Theorists

A Chair of Mathematics at Macquarie University was advertised today 
(Saturday) in the Sydney Morning Herald.  I notice that it has not 
yet appeared on the appropriate Macquarie website:

http://www.pers.mq.edu.au/ads/index.html

But it should be there soon!  The reference number for the job is 19139.
The appointee "will be supported by a substantial start-up grant and 
a new lectureship in the Department."

I would be very happy to hear from anyone genuinely interested, or of 
good suggestions for possible candidates.

I would also like to point out that good opportunities now exist for 
postgraduate study in category theory at Macquarie.  Australian 
students can be funded by Australian Postgraduate Awards (APA) as 
usual.  However, new opportunities exist for international students 
to have their fees waived and obtain a living allowance comparable to 
the APA.  Of course, these Scholarships are awarded competitively.
See
http://www.mq.edu.au/postgrad/awards.htm

Our category group (CoACT) is eligible for RAACE awards:
http://www.mq.edu.au/postgrad/schl/RAACE.htm

I also believe there will be things called iMURS advertised soon 
which include the waiving of fees.
http://www.mq.edu.au/international/graduate/

I would be happy to hear from, or of, prospective postgraduate 
students interested in working towards a PhD in category theory at 
Macquarie.

Yours truly,
Ross

I unfortunately deleted Charles's reply to the question about dimension
being an operation.  But thinking about it I realized that dimension is
not an operation in the theory of vector spaces either; It is not
preserved by morphisms.  For vector spaces, even finite dimensional ones,
the existence of dimension is a theorem.  But the original question was
not about vector spaces, but about coordinate spaces.  For which the only
morphisms are square permutation matrices.  

And the distributive law does not say that multiplication is a morphism
with respect to addition.  It does say that multiplication by a fixed
element (on the right or the left) is a morphism with respect to addition.  
But I don't think that an infinitary distributive law (say between
infinite sups and infinite infs) can be stated in such a way at all.

Dear Derek,

since "Matrices, Monads and the Fast Fourier Transform" in
the early 90's I've written a couple of other papers on
semantics of datatypes. "A semantics for shape" considers
more general datatypes than just vectors. "Data categories"
is an attempt to embrace co-datatypes as well as
datatypes. These, and other papers about the implications
for computing, including the array programming language FISh
are available from my web-site

http://www-staff.it.uts.edu.au/~cbj

May I add that we are stabilising a prototype of FISh2 which
is altogether more expressive and simpler than FISh. We hope
to release it shortly. 

Now let me address your particular question.

you are concerned that the morphism #: VA -> N mapping a
vector of A's to its length does not appear to preserve any
structure, and so perhaps should not be a morphism at all.
There are two aspects to the answer. First, the existence of
this morphism is part of the definition of the object of
vectors. Given an arrow A -->I we define the corresponding
vectors by the pullback

VA ---> LA
|       | 
|       | 
NxI --> LI

where L is the list functor, and then # is defined by
composing VA -->NxI with the projection from NxI to N. If
the ambient category is Set then such pullbacks exist and
the function # is a well-defined function. The second point
is that # can be thought of as the upper part of an arrow
between arrows which maps a vector of A's to the
corresponding vector of 1's

VA ---> V1  isom   N
|       |          |
|       |          |
NxI --> Nx1 isom   N


I'd be happy to address any other questions you have
privately.

Yours,
Barry Jay

Anders Kock:

Characterization of stacks of principal fibre bundles

is available on the address

http://www.ml.kva.se/preprints/meta/KockThu_May_17_12_51_36.rdf.html

Abstract: Stacks of principal fibre bundles are stacks whose 
total category has binary products, and an atlas. 
This holds on any basis category equipped with a class of
descent morphisms (the notions of atlas, stack, etc. refer to this class.)

An update of diagxy is now available as
ftp.math.mcgill.ca//pub/barr/diagxy.zip.
It fixes a couple of serious bugs (in more esoteric shapes), makes some
minor improvements in the macros and adds and modifies the
documentation, including clarifying the license to make it absolutely
clear that there are no restrictions of use.  In addition, I have
corrected a couple of typos that Steve Bloom found.  In addition, I
recommend that you download the paper derfun.tex.  This is a paper that
I wrote last summer (and has been submitted for publication) that I have
modified to use the new macros.  The bug fixes and modifications were
found in getting this paper looking right.

	What are the desired properties for a model of real type?

		1) It must be a field or work like it, etc.

	I intend to endow intervals with a weak notion of equivalence,
what make it works like a field, what will enable us to use intervals an
representations of real numbers. What are the desired properties that the
resulting structure must satisfy. Some bibliography is welcome.

The connected functors we have mentioned the other day, i.e. those
functors  p: E -> B  for which  (-).p Set^B -> Set^E  is fully faithful,
are easily seen to be precisely the lax epimorphisms of the 2-category Cat
(of small categories). We do not know whether every pseudoepimorphism
in Cat is connected, does anyone know? The answer is affirmative if
B  is a preorder.

Travel

 Lipari is the largest island of the Eolie Archipelago, located north
 of Sicily, well known for its volcanic activities. It has sceneries
 of incomparable beauty and contrasting character. It can be easily
 reached from Milazzo, Palermo, Naples, Messina and Reggio Calabria by
 ferry or hydrofoil (50 minutes from Milazzo).

 The suggested route is to fly to Catania (CTA), reach the port of
 Milazzo  by bus, and from there reach Lipary by hydrofoil or ferry. 
 Alternatively, fly to Reggio Calabria (REG) and the Lipari by hydrofoil.
 Detailed instructions and timetables will be emailed to the participants 
 at registration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Costs

 The workshop registration fee is 220K ITL (around 110 euro), payable
 cash at the meeting. A social dinner will be organised on Fri Jul 6. 
 Participants will be able to join the excursion to the volcano Stromboli 
 planned for Sun 8 for the Lipari School.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good morning,

Does anyone have a bibliography of typical "computer science" version
of computability from the strict category view? I am thinking of texts
that are along the lines Hopcroft and Ullman's "Automata, Languages,
and Computation". MathRev lists about 80 entries satisfying
"computability" and "category theory" but I don't see any textbooks in
the mix.

Any help appreciated.

steve

Science world in revolt at power of the journal owners 

James Meek, science correspondent
Guardian

Saturday May 26, 2001

Scientists around the world are in revolt against moves by a powerful
group of private corporations to lock decades of publicly funded
western scientific research into expensive, subscription-only
electronic databases.

At stake in the dispute is nothing less than control over the fruits
of scientific discovery - millions of pages of scientific information
which may hold the secrets of a cure for Aids, cheap space travel or
the workings of the human mind.

More than 800 British researchers have joined 22,000 others from 161
countries in a campaign to boycott publishers of scientific journals
who refuse to make research papers freely available on the internet
after six months.

"Science depends on knowledge and technology being in the public
domain," said Michael Ashburner, professor of biology at Cambridge
University and one of the leading British signatories of the campaign,
the Public Library of Science (PLS).

"In that sense, science belongs to the people, and the fruits of
science shouldn't be owned or even transferred by publishers for huge
profits. The fruits of our research - which is, overwhelmingly,
publicly paid for - should be made available as widely and as
economically as possible."

Anger has been simmering for more than a decade in the research
libraries of Europe and the US at the massive increase in the cost of
subscriptions to scientific journals, which collectively make up the
sum of the world's scientific research.

As the power of the internet to mine electronically archived journals
for data grows, scientists have become increasingly frustrated at the
journal publishers' plans to keep tight, lucrative control over
decades of their work.

Last year the most powerful journal publisher, the Anglo-Dutch firm
Reed Elsevier, made a profit of #252m on a turnover of #693m in its
science and medical business.

Elsevier Science and other journal publishers effectively benefit from
the public purse twice: once when taxpayer-funded scientists submit
their work to the journals for free, and again when taxpayer-funded
libraries buy the information back from them in the form of
subscriptions.

In Britain, the government is so concerned about the power of Reed
Elsevier that it has blocked its #3.2bn takeover of another big
journal publisher, Harcourt, while complaints about its market
dominance are investigated.

Derk Haank, the head of Elsevier Science, protested at the singling
out of his company, and portrayed the boycott group as naive
idealists. "Everybody would like to have everything available, all the
time, and preferably for free," he said.

"That's a general human trait, but I'm not sure the business model is
realistic. I'm not ashamed to make a profit. I would only be ashamed
if people were saying I was delivering a lousy service."

He added: "Research is publicly funded, but the cost of publishing it
isn't. If the funding authorities were to decide to pay for
publication I would provide it for free."

You won't find copies of most of Reed Elsevier's 1,100 journals on
newsagents' shelves. With titles like Thin Walled Structures, Urban
Water, Journal of Supercritical Fluids and Trends in Parasitology,
their publications don't have the allure of Elle or FHM but the price
of a year's subscription would make mass market publishers drool with
envy.

A year's subscription to Alcohol - nine issues - comes in at about
#100 an issue. One Elsevier journal, Brain Research, costs more than
#9,000 a year. Another, Preventative Veterinary Medicine, is now #713
a year, an increase of more than 300% over its 1991 price of #171.

Elsevier justifies the increases on the grounds that the number of
articles being submitted increases each year, adding to the firm's
costs. Each article must be peer-reviewed by fellow scientists to see
if it is worthy of publication.

Mr Haank added that his firm's price increases forced libraries to cut
subscriptions, which in turn cut Elsevier's income, forcing them to
increase prices still more.

Elsevier wanted to get out of this vicious circle, he said, and was
trying to get universities to sign up for electronically archived
versions of its journals. The firm has taken on 1,500 people to put
its entire journal archive - going back to 19th century editions of
The Lancet - on computer databases. But he said the price of
subscription to the electronic database would still be tightly linked
to the ever rising cost of the paper journals.

"Our plan is to make everything available in the academic or
professional environment, not just in six months, but on day one," he
said. "Somebody has to pay for the cost of the system."

Scientific research is not considered real unless it has been
published in a recognised journal, and scientists' status and
promotion is tied to publication.

As a rule, neither the scientists who write the papers, nor their
colleagues who peer review them, nor the editorial boards who vet
them, are paid. The publishers' costs are printing, the tiny full-time
staff on each journal - typically two people - marketing, and
distribution.

While the feud over the price of journals was between libraries and
publishers, the scientists stood aside, but the advent of the internet
has changed everything.

Powerful search engines trawling computer databases make it possible
for scientists to discover groundbreaking links between different
research results which would previously have taken years of trawling
through a jungle of indexes.

The prospect of this incredible new tool being controlled by large
private corporations has jerked scientists into action.

"The major commercial publishers have every reason to feel
threatened," Prof Ashburner said. "They charge very high prices, and
they are very insistent on copyright transfer. We are not paid for
publication, and we see no reason whatsoever why we should hand over
copyright to a commercial publisher, having done the work, both the
science and the writing.

"The costs these publishers are charg ing are such that even in the
wealthy countries we can't always afford to buy the information back,
and it's off-limits totally for the developing world."

In a letter to the competition commission in March, Clive Field,
librarian at Birmingham University and head of the Consortium of
University Research Libraries said that the Elsevier-Harcourt merger
would give one company control over journals representing 42% of a
typical university's spend in that area.

He said Elsevier and Harcourt were already trying to drive too tough a
deal with their electronic archive. "Neither publisher has yet offered
a deal which is recognised to be fair and equitable," he wrote. "It is
not unnaturally feared that a merged publisher, operating in a market
where the buyer is weak, would be even less subject to the price
checks and balances that a more open market would offer."

229.1 WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?
      Michael Barr, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, McGill 
      University, barr@barrs.org

I have been reading the prices newsletter for a year and a half and 
I would like to make some comments, especially to refute some of 
the more outrageous claims made by publishers.

I believe that I have an unusually broad perspective on the 
publishing business, having witnessed it from several angles. First 
and foremost, I have been an active researcher (in mathematics), 
having been author (or occasionally coauthor) of some 70 articles 
and coauthor of two books, one of which is about to go into its 
third edition. Second, I have been member and chair of the Canadian 
Mathematical Society (CMS) publications committee and have a clear 
idea of what its publishing costs actually are. Third, I am an 
editor or associate editor of two print journals, one published by 
a commercial publisher and one by a university press, as well as 
editor of two electronic journals, both distributed free. Finally, 
my daughter worked for two years around 1990 in the journals 
department of an academic publisher and I have had extensive 
discussions with her about her experiences and those of people she 
knows who are still in the field.

The CMS journals are not the cheapest journals published by a 
society but still beat any commercial journal by a factor of 2 to 
5, according to the figures collected by Ron Kirby. There used to 
be page charges, but only about 30% of the authors paid them and 
they were eventually abandoned as more trouble than they were 
worth. Despite this, the CMS has a clear profit of perhaps 
$100,000/year, and this is a major source of income for the society 
(which has maybe 1000 members). This is real, not paper profit. 
What expenses do we skip by not being commercial? We have some 
typesetting costs but most of the articles now come already set in 
the mathematical typesetting system TeX that has rapidly become the 
standard for mathematical publication. But this is also true for 
the commercial journals. As a result, publishing costs have dropped 
substantially in recent years, although not as much as we were led 
to believe. Incidentally, twenty and thirty years ago, publishers 
claimed that the reason mathematics was so expensive to publish was 
the typesetting costs. Now that most manuscripts come in already 
typeset, they claim that typesetting was a negligible part of the 
cost. We have to pay for copy editing costs, printing, binding, 
mailing, etc. We do little advertising, but advertising is not a 
major item for established journals in any case. Once upon a time 
we got free office space, telephone and mailing privileges and even 
some secretarial services from the university where the editors 
were, but as university budgets have tightened, we have had to 
start paying for these just like any commercial journal. The one 
expense we clearly do not have is a stipend paid the editor-in-
chief. I do not know how much that is, but it cannot be significant 
for a journal that costs $3000 a year and has a subscription base 
of 1000.

So where does all the money go? One answer was supplied by my 
daughter who informs me that her publisher had five levels of 
administrators who had no day-to-day contact with the actual 
publishing, but make decisions increasingly removed from reality 
and draw six or even seven figure salaries. No doubt, the higher 
executives travel first class, or perhaps by corporate jet. By 
contrast, the CMS journals are overseen by a publication committee, 
the executive committee and board of directors of the society and, 
ultimately, the membership, all of whom exercise a very light hand 
and operate gratis. Of course, if societies were to undertake to 
publish dozens of journals, this structure would no longer work. So 
one answer is surely that in academic journal publishing, there are 
few, if any, economies of scale and very serious diseconomies. In 
that case, the fact that publishing is falling into fewer and fewer 
hands is even more disturbing.

The electronic journal I help edit, _Theory and Applications of
Categories_, is free and available to everyone with an internet
connection. We have published only about a dozen papers a year, but 
that's ok; we want to establish a reputation and have it there if 
the other journals fold. I have announced publicly that I will 
neither referee for nor submit papers to high priced commercial 
journals. I quite recently refused to become an editor for a new 
journal that was to have been published by, I think, Birkhaeuser. 
Partly for that reason, the to-be editor decided to make it 
electronic instead. I should add that not all commercial publishers 
are high priced. There are a couple of small publishers that are 
publishing good journals at reasonable prices.

As an author, I am beginning to feel ill-used. I spend the time 
doing the research, writing it up and so on and the journals end up 
owning it. The quid pro quo is forty or fifty "free" reprints? They 
tell us that copyright acts are there to protect intellectual 
property, but they certainly don't protect mine. My interests are 
served by distribution as wide as possible and the publishers' by 
restricting distribution to the few that can still pay for it. For 
the last two papers published in a commercial journal, I altered 
the copyright form to retain the right to post electronically. The 
publisher accepted it, but would they if a large number of authors 
did it? I do know that one colleague of mine got a letter from a 
publisher's lawyer ordering him to remove one of his papers from 
his electronic archive. Actually, it is only in the last 15 or 20 
years that I have been even asked to sign copyright documents; 
perhaps since the 1976 US copyright act. Before that, the issue 
never arose. The CMS journals and the electronic journal I edit ask 
only for a one-time licence.

When you ask what a publisher adds to a publication, there is copy
editing, printing, binding, mailing, subscription servicing and 
maybe a tiny bit of publicity (once the journal is established). I 
think they also add an enormous amount of often useless overhead. 
When published electronically, only the copy-editing remains. Since 
our journal is published free, this is not done in any systematic 
way. It is left to the author and I, on one occasion, returned a 
paper to the author for serious TeX deficiencies. He had to hire 
someone to repair it since he refused to learn enough TeX to do it 
himself. That is unfortunate and I sympathize with him, but think 
of it as a form of page charge. As an editor, I do for free exactly 
what I do for the other two journals for free. The editor-in-chief 
(actually called managing editor) of the electronic journal does 
more. He spends 3-6 hours on each paper and, so long as we have 
only a dozen a year, he does not mind. But he and the other editors 
are aware that there is a serious problem brewing here and we do 
not know what to do about it. The obvious thing would be for the 
universities to take some part of their serials budget and simply 
subsidize these activities that have the potential of enormous 
savings in the long run. But how do you get there from here?

Although this would sap the library's budget, it should not result 
in loss of jobs in the library since exactly the same (or more) 
tasks of storage, archival and retrieval would exist. It would only 
sap the journal acquisitions budget. But what I don't see is how 
the universities could be made to share these costs in an equitable 
fashion. Some would subsidize these electronic journals and others 
would be tempted to sponge off those. This is a problem, but not I 
think an insuperable one.

Why do we publish in journals at all?  In fact, all my papers in 
the last ten years have been distributed electronically and are old 
hat by the time they are published. We all know the answer. For 
promotions and tenure (no longer an issue for me) and research 
grants (I still have a good one and would like to keep it). Thus 
the only real problem is that of certification. And acceptance of 
electronic publication is growing. Note that we did not name our 
journal "Electronic journal .." We decided it would be like naming 
it "The A4 journal of.." In the end, I think there will be good and 
poor electronic journals just as there are good and poor print 
journals. For the time being, however, I am not recommending 
electronic publication for young researchers.

A recent writer to this newsletter made the fatuous suggestion that 
free electronic journals might be violating the anti-trust laws. An 
elephant cannot sue a mouse for anti-trust violations. The anti-
trust laws are not there to guarantee a business success; they are 
there to protect consumers from price gouging by a monopolist. If 
an airline is sued over low prices, it is not the low prices that 
are the ultimate problem but the likelihood that, once the 
competitor is driven out of the market, the price will be raised to 
a much higher level. The history of People's Air shows that this is 
not just a theory. Much as I would like to see some of the 
commercial publishers driven out of business, I know this is not 
likely to happen. Even if did, the publishers of electronic 
journals could not raise prices the way paper journals have since 
the barriers to starting new ones are so low.

Since anti-trust was mentioned, it is a wonder to me that some 
state attorneys-general haven't decided that the journals are 
running a monopolistic business and are engaged in price gouging. 
After all, a significant part of the state universities' budgets 
are going to these publishers. The fact that, as recently pointed 
out in these pages, a few private universities can still afford 
these journals is irrelevant.

But let us engage in some speculation by supposing that it is 
illegal to do work gratis. Then the most guilty are the researchers 
who do the work in the first place and give it away to the 
publishers. Perhaps the publishers ought to be required to pay 
serious money for the rights to publish. It was one thing when the 
major journals were non-profit and were performing a service to the 
profession just by existing. But now it is a big business; why 
should they not pay for their raw materials. Then there is the free 
editorial work. I believe the editors-in-chief do get a significant 
"honorarium." But the remaining editors do not usually get so much 
as a postage stamp. At least, I never have. The authors and editors 
at least get some recognition for their work. What about the 
anonymous referees? Honest refereeing is hard work and there is no 
payoff, either in money or honor. Yet without it the whole system 
would come crashing down. It was done free for the good of the 
profession in the old days, since the journals themselves were non-
profit. When commercial journals came along (which started, at 
least in a big way, in the 1960s), we just went along with free 
refereeing since, it was what we were accustomed to. What would 
have happened if the referees had insisted on being paid? I, for 
one, have just made a personal decision to do no more unpaid 
refereeing for commercially published journals. No decision I have 
ever made in my professional career has been less painful. If more 
of us adopted such a policy, the whole enterprise would collapse. 
Moreover, it would cost us individually nothing since only the 
editors would know. As an editor, I will still ask people to 
referee papers, but if they all refuse, the journal will disappear.

One new feature on the publishing scene is that several of the old 
line journals that used to be published by mathematical societies, 
especially in Europe, have been taken over by commercial houses. I 
assume that the societies sell them for a tidy sum. The price 
usually stays low for a few years and then starts rising often to 
stratospheric heights. My department is likely to stop subscribing 
to the oldest mathematical journal in the world, of which we have a 
complete set. It will be a painful decision, but the journal is 
very expensive and no longer of much importance.

I have not mentioned the actual disparity of costs. I recently
calculated the cost per page, for each of the nearly one hundred
journals we had a paid subscription to in 1996 (we also have a
substantial number of exchange subscriptions, all non-commercial).  
I realize that this is a crude measure, since not all pages are the 
same size. But at least it is better than just looking at 
subscription cost. The costs per page ranged from $.04 to $4.86. If 
you remove the top and bottom ten, the range is $.18 to $1.37, a 
factor of over 7. The journal at $.18 happens to be on anybody's 
list of the top 5 mathematics journals in the world. So does the 
eighth most expensive, which costs $1.51. There is no correlation 
between price and quality. There was one commercial journal at $.38 
and one society published journal at $.75 and they were the 
respective extremes. But every journal that cost more than $.75 (a 
couple of Russian translations excepted) was commercially published 
and everyone below $.38 was published by a society or a university. 
The figures show that some of the top journals in the world are 
among the cheapest. Unfortunately, a couple of the top journals are 
among the most expensive and this will be our most difficult 
decision as we have to cut about 10% from our budget, while prices 
are estimated to rise 13% besides (part of that due to exchange 
rate fluctuations).

I have read that if C is a category, and the axiom of choice is assumed, then
Pro C is equivalent to its full subcategory of diagrams where the diagram
category is an inversely-directed set.  Does anyone know where this is proved
in the literature?

Thanks,

I completely agree with the views about commercial journals in
 - Mike Barr's article in the "Newsletter on serials pricing issues" (29 May),
 - Peter Johnstone's resignation letter as an editor of JPAA         (15 Jan),
 - James Meek's article ("Guardian", 26 May) on the cost of journals (28 May).
                                   (The dates refer to "categories" postings.)

As Mike Barr pointed out, but James Meek seems not to know, the
journals no longer do the work of typesetting papers, so in the Web
age the commercial publishers do NOTHING AT ALL.

Without meaning to diminish my agreement that we should stop giving
our research and our institutions' money to the commercial publishers,
I would like to be "advocatus diaboli" on an issue of management.

My question is this:
      Is a commercial (or university) publisher, being outside the
      academic community, better able to deal with complaints against
      editors than an academic managing editor can be?  An academic 
      editor is subject to other pressures, which may be summed up as "not
      falling out with colleagues", whereas a commercial manager can be
       more ruthless in enforcing the rules.

I am thinking of complaints of a management rather than intellectual
nature, of course. For example, failing to pass papers from authors to
referees and the referees' reports back again within a reasonable time.

(This has been a real issue for me, but I have no intention of naming
names.   I would like to see a discussion of professional standards
of editing and refereeing sometime, but not on THIS occasion.)

The kind of answer that I'm looking for would be an (anonymised) 
account of some incident where a commercial publisher has dealt with
a complaint better or worse than an academic managing editor would.

[Note from moderator: This and one further posting address the issue in
the subject heading. The items from Peter Freyd and Michael Barr were
posted for information, but the subject is not directly relevant.  Please
send replies for T. Leinster and P. Taylor directly to them rather than
the list.]

I'm writing to seek suggestions. 

I'd very much like to sign the boycott letter mentioned in the article
forwarded by Peter Freyd (relevant bits quoted below).  More generally, I'd
prefer to avoid perpetuating the more exploitative aspects of commercial
publication.

But I'm not going to sign the letter just yet.  This is because it seems that
if I commit myself to only publishing in "enlightened" journals then my
options will be severely restricted, to the extent that it might harm my
future job prospects.  Unfortunately, it's a sacrifice I'm not quite willing
to make.

What I'd like to find is that it is actually possible to publish in respected
journals while keeping my papers free to whoever wants them.  So my first
question is: which journals have enlightened policies?  I know about TAC, and
I've seen the list (http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/journals) of journals which
accept submission direct from the electronic archive (and so, presumably, are
happy for the papers they publish to be freely available).  What other
enlightened publications - especially category-theoretic - are there?

Mike Barr's article also mentioned copyright agreements, and I'd be
interested to know of other people's experiences with this.  Which journals
are happy for you to retain copyright of your papers, or for you to modify
the agreement so that you at least retain the right to make your own work
electronically available?  And how exactly do you make these modifications
(e.g. wording)?  Is it perhaps easier just to sign the agreement but post it
electronically anyway, and hope no-one notices?  (I would have imagined
this perfectly safe except for a certain experience of a colleague.)

Well, I'm eager to hear of positive experiences...

Thanks,

Tom Leinster

Choice isn't needed: all you need is the result that, for any filtered
category C, there is a directed poset P and a final functor P --> C.
There is a proof of this somewhere in SGA4 (I don't have the reference
to hand), where it is attributed to Pierre Deligne; but I suspect it
may be older than this.

This is due to Deligne, and can be found towards 
the beginning of SGA4, Expose I, section 8. I would
like to know of a more recent source that is so (or 
more) thorough on the subject.
