Dear Colleagues:

    There is something that I have been thinking about for a long time
that I would like to share with you.  This concerns what has happened to
publication in the last 50 years, although it possibly continues a trend
that has been going on for a long time.  I have a habit, when looking up
a reference in a journal, of looking at other papers in the same journal
to see what people were thinking about at the time.  It is astonishing.
When I look at the average paper in JPAA, I can make no sense of it in
most cases.  It is generally ultra-technical and has likely been
shortened to the point that only an expert in the subject can read it
and not always then.  Go back and read a paper from the 40s.  From the
Annals, or from TAMS.  It is amazing, but you will actually be able to
read most of them.  Many of the authors actually explain clearly what
they are dong and why.  They go into enough detail that the reader has a
chance.  It was a different era, of course, but it is amazing to see how
technical mathematics has become in just 50 years.

There are a number of reasons for this.  The pressure to publish is what
is ultimately responsible and that has certainly not been entirely bad.
Without the possibility of electronic publication, this would even get
worse.  Electronic journals, like TAC, will help for size per se will no
longer be an obstacle.  But in the beginning, at least, TAC will not
publish expository papers and will be reluctant to publish new proofs
too.  And given the various pressures by university administrations,
untenured people will be loath to spend the time on getting the
exposition clear.

When I get a paper for TAC, I basically ask myself if the paper would
have been publishable in JPAA.  I have been an editor of JPAA since it
was founded, what, 25 years ago?  I hope to remain and editor until it
ceases to publish, which I expect in about five years.  But in the
meantime, I have a fairly good idea of what it publishes and I would
like to transfer this quality to TAC.

    Now imagine you get a paper, say, that takes a known theorem of ring
theory and shows that the result depends only on some straightforward
categorical property and states and proves that property using an
argument that is a direct translation of the ring-theoretic argument.
Here is an example:  I, and no doubt many others, once observed that the
theorem that a von Neumann regular ring has canonical quasi-inverses,
unique subject to certain equations has an immediate categorical
generalization that applies the category of finite dimensional vector
spaces, but it never occurred to me to try to publish it.  I assume no
one else has either.  I think it safe to say that such a paper is not
the sort of thing that JPAA would publish.  It is a shame really because
that is useful insight.  Perhaps equally useful is that the same fact is
false for strongly von Neumann regular rings.  (Actually, the property
in question cannot even be stated in a category).  Anyway, the point I
wanted to make is that we would not want to publish it in TAC, because
we must maintain credibility if we are to be in a position to take over
gracefully as JPAA loses its subscribers.  What we must avoid at all
costs is to get a reputation as a place to send your "works of the left
hand".

Just a few days ago, I was reading a philosopher who imagined that a lot
of mathematical publication was concerned with publishing refined proofs
on known results.  I don't know where he got that idea, but of course it
is almost entirely wrong.  There is almost no outlet for such material,
especially if it is an area of 20th century mathematics, which nearly
eliminates the Monthly.  There is L'Enseignement Mathematiques and I
once made essential use of something published there.  But the very name
of the journal is a guarantee that deans (and department promotion
committees) are not likely to take it seriously.

    I happen to have sitting on my desk an M.Sc. thesis in math written
about 10 years ago by a man who is now a computer scientist.  He gives a
surprisingly simple proof of the fact that every manifold of class at
least C^2 has a simple cover.  As it happened, I used this fact in a
recent paper.  I had to give reference to a classical proof that uses
the existence of a Riemannian metric.  (You then use small
neighbourhoods for your cover.)  I would really have liked to have an
argument that I understood.  But this paper is probably unpublishable,
at least in respectable journals, since no matter how nice it is (and
several analyst colleagues of mine agree it is very pretty and quite
surprising too), the main result is not new.

    What I think we need is a journal devoted to what I will call
explanatory papers.  This is not intended to be the same as expository,
although expository papers might fit.  But new proofs, better proofs,
more enlightening proofs, that sort of thing.  Generalizations, provided
they cast new light, would be welcome, but it would not be intended
primarily for new results.  I even have a (very) tentative name:
Mathematical Insights.  If this is too pretentious, it is not cast in
concrete.  Of course, it would be electronic, under the same regime as
TAC.  It would not, however, be primarily for category theory but could
cover all of mathematics.  I post this on the categories bulletin board
because that is the one I am on, but I would prefer it to go far and
wide.

(Since I wrote that someone mentioned to me that that NewAge Celestine
Prophecy uses "insight".  I cannot let that stop me from using it
properly.)

Any interest?

I like Mike's proposal. And I would shorten the title to "Insights".

When David Buchsbaum became editor of TAMS he announced that he

new theorems for old proofs.

I gather, though, that Mike is suggesting that occasionaly the

Dear Michael,

Your proposed new journal sounds interesting.  Having a source 
that gave, in relatively brief form, the collected results from and 
overviews of areas of investigation would be wonderful.  Often, one 
needs to read several books and specialized papers to get this---and 
that only when the material exists.  For example, I would like to see 
some compact papers that discuss categorical logics, such as geometric 
logic, giving a set of axioms and rules of inference along with a 
grounding in the model theory and any other machinery useful to a 
beginner (in my case, to accelerate the learning process so I can apply 
it).  Presently, I find I have to communicate with the people researching 
the area.  While I enjoy doing this, I am feaful of becoming a pest.

I have a question in connection with electronic journals that no one has 
been able to answer so far.  What about archival publication?  What is the 
guarantee that an electronic publication will be (1) citable, 
(2) available 50 years from now? (OK, so there are many questions!)  I am 
citing a paper that appeared in 1943.

Thanks,

Dear Mr. Barr

	Thank you for your thoghtful letter on mathematical publishing.
I am not a "mathematician" in the sense that my job is to do research
and find new results. I am a "mathematician" in the sense that my
job is to bring more mathematics into application, and particular,
into application to software. I am particularly interested in
category theory for this purpose. I think this makes me a "consumer"
of the papers published in mathematics journals.

	Since I am using category theory, the mathematics I use
is not too old. The results of category theory have not been
through several generations of mathematicians to refine the
concepts in the same way that analysis has. This means that
I do have occasion to look at recent articles published in the
journals.

	I would say that articles that show new and better
deriviations of known results would be of *primary* interest
to me. I think that mathematics is just as much about coming
up with proofs as it is about coming up with results. Indeed,
no one believes your result until you have a proof. In fact I
think a result does not really become part of the mainstream
until it has been through a generation or two of refinement
and the original proof (probably long) has become a short and
elegant proof. Mathematics is as much about elegance as it is
about results, and I feel that those who find new proofs are
doing original work just as much as those who find new results.

	As one who applies mathematics, I need to understand
the results. For the most part, this means understanding how
they were derived - "where they come from". It is possible to
apply a body of mathematics when you have a good understanding
of most of the material but you skipped the proofs of one or two
results that are too lengthy or difficult. It is also possible to
understand the main principles of a theory (say integration and
differentiation) and then use a large body of technical results
without proof (a table of integrals or a table of solutions
to differential equations). I think it is _not_ possible to use
a body of mathematics by just reading the results and hoping that
you understand them well enough that you will not misapply them.

	To apply the mathematics requires not so much a 
familiarity with the latest results, as it does a thoorough
and deep understanding of the main results of the theory.
For example, in category theory, for applications I believe
one wants a thorough understanding of limits and colimits,
functors and natural transformation, adjoints, toposes, sheaves,
probably grothendieck topologies, and I am sure I must have
left a few out. In order to understand these concepts it seems
to be necessary to know about a couple of domains of application
within mathematics, especially abstract algebra and vector
spaces. To thoroughly understand this material would mean to
have seen the proofs, step by step. Seeing two or three different
proofs of the main results would be helpful. In addition, examples
and applications of all the main results should be given. The
examples and applications should be limited to a narrow sphere,
such as basic abstract algebra. It is not useful to be given one
example from algebraic geometry, another from topology on 4
manifolds, and a third from harmonic analysis on semi simple
lie groups. I know very little about all three of these topics,
but I find myself fully capable of understanding category theory.

	So I say, by all means let us have journals, monthlies,
bulletin boards, whatever it takes to get publishing going that
addresses new and better proofs, new insights about the connections
between two theories AND new applications of the old theories.
I think this would

	- Give students a place to publish results that are
	  useful, but not earthshaking.

	- Give application people such as me the same thing.

	- Spread understanding of esoteric topics such as
	  category theory.

	All of these would eventually lead to more results.

Regards

Peter White

Subject: extensive stuff 

Date: Tue, 6 Aug 1996 14:24:15 -0400
From: Peter Freyd <pjf@saul.cis.upenn.edu>

The phrase  DISTRIBUTIVE  CATEGORY  is established as referring to a
category with finite products and coproducts wherein coproducts
distribute with products. The phrase  EXTENSIVE  CATEGORY  refers to
a cartesian category (that is, one with finite limits) with finite
coproducts wherein coproducts are preserved by pullbacks.

(Bill, they tell me you gave it this name because measurements tend
to be valued in such. Right?)

An equivalent definition of an extensive category is a cartesian
category that's _locally_ distributive, that is, every slice category
is distributive.

I've recently finally been able to find the right expansion of what
I've called "cartesian logic" (the syntax of cartesian categories) to
what I guess I will have to call "extensive logic" (the syntax of
extensive categories). Cartesian logic can be sloganized as the logic
of _unique_ existentials. For extensive logic add _exclusive_
disjunctions. (Yes, all you purists, "sloganized" is in the OED.
Actually, the American Heritage Electronic Dictionary would seem to
define it as the result of turning something into a Scottish war cry.)

With cartesian logic we first obtain a completeness theorem with
respect to the semantics of cartesian categories (by constructing the
free cartesian category from a given theory and noting what rules of
inference are needed to make the construction work) and then we obtain
a completeness theorem with respect to the "elemental semantics" by
using the fact that set-valued representations for any small cartesian
category are collectively faithful. By the time we're done we need
that the representations reflect not just equality and isomorphisms
but non-split-epis into non-epis. (The Cayley representations, of
course, do all this.)

Similarly for extensive logic. Here we need the fact that the
set-valued representations of any small extensive category are
collectively faithful, indeed, collectively reflect (not just equality
and isomorphisms but) split epis. By "representation" I mean a functor
that preserves finite limits and finite coproducts. It would not be
enough to preserve just finite products and coproducts for the
semantics. That is, I must work in the context of extensive categories
not distributive categories. (Cayley, of course, no longer suffices.)

Do distributive categories arise in nature that aren't extensive?

The quickest artificial example is the full subcategory, *A*, of 
(*S*)x(*S*), where  *S*  is the category of sets.  A pair  <X,Y>  is 
in  *A*  if either both  X  and  Y  are non-empty or both are empty.  
*A*  is coreflective, hence cartesian. It's closed under the formation 
of products and coproducts, hence distributive (indeed, it's closed
under the formation of exponentials, hence an exponential category).

*A*  is not an extensive category.  <{a,b},{a,b}>  is the coproduct of
<{a},{a}>  and  <{b},{b}>.  The intersection of each of these 
subobjects with  <{a},{b}>  is  <{},{}>  hence pulling back along the 
inclusion map of  <{a},{b}>  does not preserve coproducts.

But I seem to have stumbled across a more natural example. In Cats and
Alligators a pair of idempotents  e, e'  are said to be "neighbors"
if  ee'e = e  and  e'ee' = e'. So, let's understand a  SEMIGROUP  OF  
NEIGHBORING  IDEMPOTENTS  to mean a semigroup satisfying the further 
equations:
             xx = x,
            xyx = x.

Note that as a consequence:  xyz = (xzx)yz = x(z(xy)z) = xz.

The category of semigroups of neighboring idempotents is a 
distributive category because, even better, it's an exponential 
category. Construct  A => B  in the naive way, that is, as the set of 
homomorphisms from  A  to  B. The semigroup structure on  A => B  is 
given pointwise: for homomorphisms  f,g:A -> B, define
fg = \a.(fa)(ga). The equation xyz = xz  forces  fg  to be a 
homomorphism.

A homomorphism  h:X*A -> B  curries to a homomorphism  h':X ->(A => B)
where the naive definition works for  h', to wit, h' = \x.(\a.f<x,a>).
The equation  xx = x  is just what's needed to see that  h'x  is a 
homomorphism for each  x, and then to see that  h'(xy) = (h'x)(h'y).

To see that the category of semigroups of neighboring idempotents is 
not an extensive category consider the four-element semigroup with
multiplication given by:
                            a b c d
                           ________
                         a |a c c a
                         b |d b b d
                         c |a c c a
                         d |d b b d

It is a coproduct (in the category of semigroups of neighboring 
idempotents) of its one-element subsemigroups {a}, {b}.  (In other 
words, it's the free semigroup of neighboring idempotents generated
by  a  and  b.)  Now intersect these generating subsemigroups with the 
one-element subsemigroup  {c} to see that pulling back along the 
inclusion map of  {c}  does not preserve coproducts.

Still here? Guess what. The two categories are equivalent and the
equivalence carries one example to the other.

Given an object, <X,Y>, in  *A*  turn  XxY  into a semigroup by 
defining  <x,y><x',y'> = <x,y'>. This is how the equivlence gets from
*A*  to the category of neighboring idempotents. Getting back is left 
to the reader.

Now the real question: how much of all this is already in Johnstone?

From: Max Kelly <kelly_m@maths.su.oz.au>


I refer to Peter Freyd's interesting letter of 6 Aug concerning
distributive and extensive categories. 

Peter, you have not got quite right the current nomenclature for
these: the definitive account of their interconnexions is in
[Carboni, Lack, Walters, Introduction to extensive and distributive
categories, JPAA 84 (1983), 145-158]. Their name for your "extensive"
is "lextensive", which I think is due to Bill Lawvere; it means "lex
and extensive", where "lex' is used to mean "having all finite limits".
(By the way, I absolutely detest this usage of "lex"; a CATEGORY cannot
be left exact!) Their "extensive" categories have only finite COPRODUCTS
as part of the structure; but these are to be such that the
canonical A/a x A/b --> A/(a+b) is to be an equivalence of categories.
The point is important because a MORPHISM of extensive categories
need preserve only finite coproducts, not finite limits (as a morphism
of lextensive categories must). So the 2-categories involved are
quite different, and this affects the notion of free category-with-
-structure.

One other thing: those semigroups you discuss are what I called
"middle-ignoring semigroups" in my paper with Pultr [ On algebraic
recognition of direct-product decompositions, JPAA 12(1978), 207-224],
where I showed them equivalent to pairs of sets with neither empty 
or both - only as the simplest and most trivial example of our
extension of Michael Barr's result on algebras for the "n-th
power monad" sending A to A^n in any category. The funny thing is
that I spoke on this as your guest in the colloquium at Philadelphia
in 1977. Anyway, the more general situation of that paper may give
more examples of distributive categories - I haven't yet had time
to think about it. The category of middle-ignoring semigroups, by
the way, and more generally the category of algebras for the n-th
power monad P_n on the category of sets, is symmetric monoidal
closed by Fred Linton's old result, since this monad is
commutative - at least I think it must be so, without stopping
now to check it.

About the nomenclature: do people agree that "lex" is really
terrible? Peter Johnstone in Sussex recently called it
something like a twice-dead metaphor - but now I forget what
he wanted in its place - was it Peter Freyd's "cartesian" ?

Not much of it, if you mean what is in Johnstone's published work,
rather than in Johnstone's mind. But my paper "A syntactic approach
to Diers' localizable categories" in Springer LNM 753 (the 1977 Durham
Symposium proceedings) is relevant: in it I introduced what I then
called "disjunctive logic", which is exactly what Peter now wants to
call "extensive logic" (and I guess that's a better name). What I was
doing there was to describe a class of theories whose model categories
(in Sets) were just the "localizable categories" (aka multiply
presentable categories) introduced by Yves Diers in his thesis: there
is nothing about extensive categories in my paper, because I didn't
know the concept at that time. However, I've known for some years now
that extensive categories are exactly the class of categories in which
this fragment of logic should be modelled -- but I haven't found a 
suitable opportunity to set this down in print.

Incidentally, the corresponding class of sketches (those with arbitrary
finite cones, but only discrete finite cocones) has been studied by
many people -- see for example Barr & Wells (TTT), page 292.

A quick PS: since "semigroups of neighbouring idempotents" satisfy the
identity xyz = xz, they already have a name: they are what the
semigroup-theorists call "rectangular bands". As such, they appear in
my paper "Collapsed toposes and cartesian closed varieties" (J. Algebra
129 (1990); see top of p. 462), as the simplest nontrivial example of
what I called a "commutative hyperaffine theory". The fact that they
form a category equivalent to the two-valued collapse of Set x Set is
in my paper (though it was known long before), as is the fact that this
category is cartesian closed but not locally cartesian closed -- and from
the proof that it's not lcc you can easily extract a proof that it's not
extensive.

Dear Peter
Everybody keeps rediscovering your *A*. It probably belongs in Insights.
Mike Barr's ``The Point of the Empty Set'' shows that the I-fold product
functor, restricted to the full subcategory of *S*^I determined by the 
``pure functors'', is monadic, in fact VTT. For I=2 the monad in question
is  TX=X^2 and a T-algebra is thus a set with a binary operation
satisfying
xx=x 
(xy)(zw)=xw
(These are obviously equivalent to associativity and the equations you 
gave.) Anyway, this explains the equivalence of categories you mentioned.

I certainly wasn't aware that *A* is distributive but not extensive. I'd
just like to point out that *A* and its generalizations is also useful for 
showing that certain apparently multisorted algebraic categories are actually
single sorted. For example, the obvious category of all modules over
all rings is monadic over *A* and thus by the above also monadic over *S*.
Others will have more to say on this. On a personal note, I first learned of 
*A* from my friend Kip Howlett who picked it up at some conference around
`71. He realized that it was what I needed for my MSc thesis that involved
M-sets with variable M and applications to automata theory. Anyway, sorting
out *A* got me into category theory.

Yikes! Paul Taylor has pointed out to me that I left out one of the
conditions for distributive and extensive categories, to wit, the
disjointness of coproducts. (Please note, however, that all the
categories that I said were distributive are distributive.)

He also points out that finite limits are not needed to say that
coproducts are stable. Of course. But they're certainly needed for
extensive logic. So: should the standard definition of extensive
categories include finite limits? Or should I -- help! -- go around
talking about "locally distributive logic"? (I included finite limits
in the definition of locally distributive, but needn't have done so:
the condition that the category and that every slice of the category
be distributive easily implies finite limits.)

yes, the algebraic theory of semigroups retracts onto the initial
theory in two ways (left projection and right projection), so we get a
theory morphism to the square of the initial theory that's surjective
for some reason or other.  the square of the initial theory is also
the natural structure theory of the right adjoint but very slightly
non-monadic functor "binary cartesian product of sets".

unfortunately i can't remember what a "band" is exactly.

There are close relationships amongst analytic functors,

Dear Peter,

I too ``rediscovered'' your *A*, precisely in looking 
for an example of a distributive category which failed
to be locally distributive, but never realized that it
had such an illustrious history.

As for distributive categories which fail to be extensive,
there is another important and natural class of examples.
Any distributive lattice, thought of as a preorder, is a
distributive category, indeed a locally distributive category
but has coproducts which are very far from being disjoint
and so fails to be extensive.

In a distributive category admits a subdirect decomposition
into a distributive and extensive category, and a distributive
preorder, in the following way. Given a distributive category D, one
can form the preorder reflection D_pr, and this is a distributive
preorder and the projection D ---> D_pr a distributive functor.
On the other hand, one can form the ``extensive reflection'' D_ext
of D (this is the image of D under the left biadjoint to the 
inclusion of the 2-category of distributive and extensive cats
in the 2-category of distributive cats), and the projection 
D ---> D_ext is also a distributive functor, and moreover the
induced functor D ---> D_ext x D_pr is fully faithful. This is
similar to a result of Cockett which fully embeds a _locally_
distributive category in the product of a lextensive category
and a distributive preorder.

The category  D_ext has a very simple construction. 
An object of D_ext is an arrow a:A-->1+1 in D.
An arrow from a:A-->1+1 to b:B-->1+1 is an arrow f:A-->B+1 in D
satisfying the condition 
		    f
		A ----> B+1
		|        |
	      a |        | b+1 
		|        | 
		v        v 
		1+1---> 1+1+1
		   inj_13

As Max Kelly pointed out, an extensive category with finite limits
has been called a lextensive category.

The problem still remains what one should call an extensive category
with finite products (such a category being necessarily distributive).
``Extensive and distributive category'' is a bit of a mouthful, and
prextensive is obviously unacceptable. Other possibilities that have
been suggested include ``2-rig'' and ``arithmetic category''.

Yes, I've been a convert for some time now to the Freydian use of
"cartesian" for categories having (or functors preserving) all finite
limits. I know this annoys the computer-science people who want to
use it for (finite products but not equalizers), but I can't think of
a better term. Actually, as applied to categories, "left exact" is a
thrice-dead metaphor (twice-dead as applied to functors, since "exact
sequence" is a dead metaphor for "exact differential", and "left exact"
as applied to functors is a dead metaphor for "preserving the left-
hand ends of exact sequences"). What status that gives to the term
"lextensive" for "extensive plus all finite limits", I shudder to
think.

Should the standard definition of extensive categories include
finite limits? Obviously Max (and Bob Walters, and Steve Lack, and
probably Bill Lawvere) would say "no". But if you want to develop
a syntax for these categories, you're not going to get very far
without the finite limits; so we do need a name for "extensive plus
finite limits". Perhaps, after all, we should revive the term
"disjunctive" from my SLNM 753 paper, and call them "disjunctive
categories". What do other people think?

Date: Sun, 11 Aug 1996 17:15:58 -0400
From: Peter Freyd <pjf@saul.cis.upenn.edu>

How about "alternating categories"? Alternatives, in ordinary
language, are usually understood to be mutually exclusive. So an
extensive cartesian category (i.e. a locally distributive category
with terminator) would be called an "alternating category" and the
corresponding syntax, "alternating logic".

A major problem: it would be hard to keep others -- since I find it
hard to keep myself -- from corrupting this to "alternative logic".
(On the other hand, whenever one is an environment where "linear
logic" is sure to be totally misinterpreted, one could claim also to
be studying "alternative logic".)

Let me go on record here for the syntax. As in cartesian logic
conjunction is the only connective and the only terms are conjunctions
of primitive predicates each followed by an appropriate sequence of
variables. Cartesian logic has just one primitive assertion, written  
A ue> B, where  A  and  B  are terms. Given an elemental interpretation 
of the primitive predicates,  A ue> B  is satisfied in the elemental 
cartesian semantics if for every instantiation of the variables of  A  
such that  A  holds there is a unique instantiation of the remaining 
variables of  B  such that  B  holds. In alternating logic the 
primitive assertions are written 
                                      A ue> B1|B2|...|Bn
where  A, B1, B2,...,Bn  are terms.  Such an assertion is said to be
satisfied in the elemental alternating semantics if for every
instantiation of the variables of  A  such that  A  holds there is a
unique index, i,  such that the remaining variables of  Bi  can be
instantiated so that  Bi  holds and, further, there is just one such
instantiation of the remaining variables of Bi. 

E.G.: for (decidable) fields, add to the cartesian theory of unital
rings the alternating axiom
                               x=x  ue>  (x=0)|(xy=1).

As for the categorical semantics, given an alternative category in
which each primitive predicate has been interpreted, extend the
interpretation to terms -- just as for cartesian logic -- using finite
limits. 

(For example: if  A  has variables  x  and  y, and  B  has variables
y  and  z  then, using brackets to designate the interpretations, 
the interpretation of  A^B  is characterized by 

                                [A^B]
                               l/   \r
                              [A]   [B]
                              / \   / \  
                            [x]  [y]  [z]

where the rhombus is a pullback.)

Note that the interpretation of a conjunction comes equipped with 
the two maps, l  and  r. 

In cartesian logic the key definition:

    A ue> B  is satisfied iff  l:[A^B] -> [A]  is an isomorphism.

In alternating logic:

  A ue> B1|B2|...|Bn  is satisfied iff the  l's  combine to give
  an isomorphism    [A^B1] + [A^B2] +...+ [A^Bn]  ->  [A].

An extensive cartesian category is _not_ the same as a locally
distributive category with terminator: as has already been pointed
out, extensive categories are also required to have disjoint
coproducts, which locally distributive categories need not, as the
example of distributive lattices shows.

Although I entirely agree that calling a category ``lex'' if it has
finite limits is a bad thing, and am not thrilled about the name 
lextensive for an extensive category with finite limits, I do think
that the name does have some advantages. In particular it makes clear
that the two notions are closely linked. As various people have
pointed out, for many uses the extensive categories won't be much use
unless you have the finite limits as well; the reason, at least from
my point of view, for isolating the extensive categories is to
emphasize the fact that they are in fact categories with finite
coproducts satisfying a certain _property_ which does not depend on 
the _structure_ of having all finite limits.

As an ``excuse'' for the name lextensive, one can think of it as
standing for (finite )l(imits +)extensive.


Steve.

Alternating (Turing) machines are fundamental to complexity and logic
programming.  The alternation is of bounded quantifiers.

The exclusive, inclusive distinction is captured by the orthogonal,
injective distinction, which is a strong model, weak model

   In cartesian logic the key definition:

On the models side of dualities, this is precisely being orthogonal to
a map.

   In alternating logic:

     an isomorphism    [A^B1] + [A^B2] +...+ [A^Bn]  ->  [A].

On the models side of dualities, this is precisely being orthogonal to
a small cone with discrete base.  E.g. see Ad\'amek and Rosick\'y's
book including its historical remarks e.g. on Y. Diers.

I like P. Johnstones's `multi-' for the map, cone distinction.

On the theory side of dualities, P. Johnstones's remarks may help me.

Just out of curiousity, if one drops the `closed' (which I do not)
from `cartesian closed' or `locally cartesian closed', what would one
expect to have?

I'm not sure about `alternating logic' and `alternating categories';
perhaps I just need time to get used to them. I think the trouble is
that in everyday speech `alternating' means something dynamic 
(switching back and forth between two states), and the logic doesn't
have any such feature. `Alternative' doesn't have the same connotation,
but I agree that `alternative logic' is impossible.

The original reason for `disjunctive' was a pun: it stands for both
`disjunction' and `disjoint'. The way I formulated the syntax
(essentially, an extension of Michel Coste's version of cartesian logic),
you are allowed to write down a disjunction of formulae if you can
prove that it's disjoint (just as you can use an existential quantifier
if you can prove that the thing being quantified is unique).

Foundations for Programming Languages

     by  John C. Mitchell 


         "Programming languages embody the pragmatics of designing
         software systems, and also the mathematical concepts which underlie
         them. Anyone who wants to know how, for example, object-oriented
         programming rests upon a firm foundation in logic should read this
         book. It guides one surefootedly through the rich variety of basic
         programming concepts developed over the past forty years."
         -- Robin Milner, Professor of Computer Science, The Computer
         Laboratory, Cambridge University 

         "Programming languages need not be designed in an intellectual
         vacuum; John Mitchell's book provides an extensive analysis of the
         fundamental notions underlying programming constructs. A basic
         grasp of this material is essential for the understanding, comparative
         analysis, and design of programming languages."
         -- Luca Cardelli, Digital Equipment Corporation 


Written for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, Foundations for
Programming Languages uses a series of typed lambda calculi to study the axiomatic,
operational, and denotational semantics of sequential programming languages. Later
chapters are devoted to progressively more sophisticated type systems. 

Compared to other texts on the subject, Foundations for Programming Languages is
distinguished primarily by its inclusion of material on universal algebra and algebraic
data types, imperative languages and Floyd-Hoare logic, and advanced chapters on
polymorphism and modules, subtyping and object-oriented concepts, and type
inference. The book is mathematically oriented but includes discussion, motivation,
and examples that make the material accessible to students specializing in software
systems, theoretical computer science, or mathematical logic.

Foundations for Programming Languages is suitable as a reference for professionals
concerned with programming languages, software validation or verification, and
programming, including those working with software modules or object-oriented
programming.

 M. Makkai, A. Pitts, TAMS 299 ('87)

but somewhat as in

they construct a dual and a double dual:

 small with multi-limits of finite diagrams

  | flat functors to set
  v

 finitely accessible with connected limits

  | functors to set preserving filtered colimits and connected limits
  v

 having finite limits and stable disjoint small coproducts

with net image the coprimes.

(1) First, in response to Peter's earlier comments about the term "cartesian": 
I would certainly like to consider Peter as a friend!  Some names for 
mathematical concepts are like old jeans: the more threadbare and holes 
they have the more comfortable they feel.  I suspect the term cartesian 
might be one such.  

I tend to think of a "cartesian tensor" as being a product - as 
saying a bit of structure is cartesian usually means it arises 
from limits -  and have abused terminology by calling what I should have 
probably called a "cartesian tensor category" (or a "cartesian monoidal 
category") a "cartesian category" -- yes this is a category with products.  
I am usually careful, however, to make this usage explicit as I am aware 
that equalizers are often assumed.

(2) Another article of comfy clothing is the term extensive!  I agree 
with Steve Lack that it is unfortunate that extensive categories are not 
assumed to have a final object (as these creatures are the more common) 
I merrily suggest abusing terminology to avoid that hiccup.  I would be less 
happy, however, to let the LEXness - or should I say cartesianness - be 
carried by the context.  My reason for this hesitation is as follows:  

If you start with a distributive category and form its extensive completion, 
as explained by Lack, then all datatypes (natural numbers, lists, etc.) lift 
into that completion.  These datatypes are shapely in the sense of 
Barry Jay (naturallity square are cartesian etc.).  However, if you, 
taking the construction from another angle, freely add equalizers to a 
distributive category with datatypes (i.e. finitely complete it) all bets 
are off: certainly datatypes which do lift need not be shapely but I conjecture 
that there is, in fact, no guarantee that they lift at all ...

Conjecture: There is a distributive category X with (strong) NNO  such that
==========  E(X) is its equalizer completion does not have a (strong) NNO.

I do not have a proof that this is so ...or not!

Coproducts appear to lift as the equalizer completion 2-functor 
preserves products.  However, clearly (consider a distributive lattice) the 
resulting coproducts need not be extensive -- although, of course, the category 
E(X) is distributive (another source of non-extensive distributive categories).  
If the distributive category is separated (or decidable) in the appropriate 
sense then certainly datatypes lift (as the extensive completion and
equalizer completion then coincide).  This is the reason why the initial 
distributive category with (strong) datatypes may be finitely completed to 
preserve all datatypes.

This makes me sensitive about the passage to Lextensive even from extensive. 
To obtain a completion in a RIGHT SENSE may be a little more delicate (or 
brutish ... depending on your approach).  The point is there are some 
outstanding issues here ..

(3) Lastly a remark on the connection between distributive categories 
and categorical proof theory:

One motivation for developing the theory of weakly distributive categories 
(wdc) was to provide a unification of the proof theory of "classical" and 
linear logic.  In particular, we supposed that the "and--or" fragment of 
classical logic has as a proof theory the free distributive category on 
its propositions.  Accordingly, in that original paper, we sketched a proof 
that distributive categories are cartesian wdc's (i.e. wdc's in which the 
tensor is a product and the cotensor a coproduct). Subsequently we never 
revisited the result. 

Over the summer while studying the nucleus of these categories we realized 
something was amiss.  Re-examing the proof we realized that one of the 
"obvious" coherence conditions was obviously false.  In fact, so 
badly does it fail for distributive categories that the revision of the 
result states:

Prop.  A cartesian wdc which is simultaneously 
       a distributive category is necessarily a preorder.

It should be mentioned that cartesian wdc's abound: pointed sets, vector 
spaces, semi-lattices, ... are examples.  Thus cartesian wdc's definitely do 
not collapse.

(Back to names!!!!
  
This does remove one of our motivations for the name "weakly distributive 
categories":  Barr suggested the term "linearly distributive".  However, 
to us the original name is now one of those comfy bits of clothing 
(even if somewhat frayed) ... In fact, if we had NOT made this 
oversight it is likely we would have been altogether more hesitant 
in the development of weakly distributive categories!  Mathematics 
moves in mysterious ways.)

There is philosophical significance to the correct result: classical 
semantic settings separate at an earlier stage than we had suspected from  
(categorical) proof theoretic settings.  In particular, distributive 
categories (a core fragment of classical setting) do not permit the 
process of cut elimination (unless they are preorders).

I can't quite imagine in what context I might have said that; it is
certainly true that life becomes easier when the extensive category
in question has a terminal object, but the whole point is that the
notion of extensivity is a property of finite coproducts. (So in
particular an extensive functor is one that preserves finite
coproducts only, although of course it then follows that pullbacks
along coproduct injections are also preserved.)

In fact, 
	(1) If X is distributive then E(X) is locally distributive
but
	(2) If X is distributive and E(X) is extensive then X is
	equivalent to the trivial category 1.
To (freely) pass from a distributive category to a lextensive one, you
first form E(X) and then the slice category p/E(X) where p is the equalizer
		  i
		 --->
	p ---> 1 ---> 1+1
		  j
of the coproduct injections i,j:1--->1+1.

The passage from extensive categories to lextensive categories, is, as
Robin says, more delicate.

There was a question raised in connection with my suggestion towards
a proposal about archiving.  There are a number of answers.  First off,
TAC is being archived by both the Canadian Math. Soc. and some
government organization.  In addition to Mt. Alison U.  What I would
like to see is some libraries print and bind each volume.  My faith
that this will happen is not increased by what I heard about one
university library.  They are planning, for some journals, that they
will receive and shelve the paper copy and then, at the end of the
year, when the online volume is available, discard it!  I have referred,
in recent papers, to papers that appeared in 1944 and 1945 and a book
(Lefschetz's Algebraic Topology) from the 30s.  I do not have the same
faith the librarian does that a 1990s electronic archive will still
be usable in 50 years, but that problem is not one for electronic journals
alone.

I did mean extensive + products and mistyped "final object."  The point 
being that these are common beasties which deserve a snappy name!  

Further, Steve Lack is correct about the fact that if E(X) is extensive and 
X is distributive then X = 1.  So I should correct my comments about when 
the equalizer completion and extensive completion coincide!  ... and I 
have to chuckle at this point as I have tripped on my own snag ...

The problem is the initial object. 

In a distributive category this object is only one way connected to the rest 
of the category so that the poset collapse of a distributive category is always 
non-trivial while the category itself is. This means the added equalizer 
                  i
                 --->
        p ---> 1 ---> 1+1
                  j
of the coproduct injections i,j:1--->1+1 in E(X) is never isomorphic to the 
initial object.  Hence Steve Lack's comment.

Some time ago (when I was in Oz, in fact) I sensitized the community 
there to exactly these issues.  In fact, I became a bit of a heretic by 
considering distributive categories without an initial object (I called these 
predistributive).  It is the initial of these gadgets (with "non-empty" 
inductive datatypes) which has E(X) extensive ... and the initial object is 
provided precisely by the added equalizer p, above.

However, it really is infinitely better to talk about LEXT(X), the 
lextensive completion, not the raw E(X) where some preinitial baggage  
may still be present.  

The conjecture still stands but is better expressed in the form:

Conjecture: There is a distributive category X with (strong) NNO  such that
==========  LEXT(X) is its lextensive completion does not have a (strong) NNO.

Regarding the debate on cartesian/extensive, we'd like to suggest
the name "arithmetic category" for an extensive category with products.

Certainly such categories seem well structured enough to do some
arithmetic, and free such are closely enough related to the free
analogies in the algebraic context (ie rigs) to be thought of as
behaving "arithmetically" in some sense.

Dear Michael
I am also strongly in favour of `Insights' but I think that those
insights that come from our community using categorical ideas should 
be published in TAC. The fact is that genuine insights are far rarer
than publishable technical papers. If TAC also publishes the kind of
papers that you spoke of it won't put the journal below JPAA but 
rather {\em above} it by true scientific criteria. If TAC had a policy
of dubbing certain papers as `Insight' papers it would probably confer 
extra prestige upon them. Why make it necessary to read yet another 
journal?

With the change in medium we have an opportunity for reform. We have
a favoured moment in history to rewrite some of the rules and tell
the dean set what is important rather than waiting to receive our next
set of instructions from them. We also have demography on our side.
Many of us have little to lose by putting a bit on the line and that

Subject: (i) new proofs (ii) Archiving of electronic journals

(i) New proofs

I had a paper accepted in which the referee wrote t
hat the theorem was not new, the proof was not new, but the paper should be
accepted, as the originals were notorious!

(ii) Archiving

I am glad the idea has been put forward of paper archiving of electronic
journals, in addition of course to other methods. This would help for
authenticity, archiving, and for prospective authors to get a quick idea of
what is in the journals. Journals on shelves have advantages over electronic
media in some respects, as well as disadvantages. 

It could be useful to ask libraries  to make a small subscription to pay for
a well produced cover for a full volume, to be bound in with it, which would
also confirm authenticity of the papers.

Of course, electronic journals may in the end include more than can easily
be put on paper, but this proposal would ensure some of the advantages  of
paper journals without the currently increasingly prohibitive cost (which
includes keeping publishers staff and offices in good order, but based on
free service by academics). 

For example, current technology would allow easy printing of colour where
required in a paper archive of an  electronic journal, and could include
reference to access for further electronic facilities (e.g. animation).

From: F William Lawvere <wlawvere@ACSU.Buffalo.EDU>


The term   EXTENSIVE was applied to certain categories in 1991
by Carboni, Lawvere, and Walters on the basis of the following
considerations. 

For centuries, mathematical philosophy has distinguished between
extensive quantities and intensive quantities, for example in
thermodynamics of inhomogeneous bodies, volume, mass, energy, and
entropy on the one hand are distinguished from pressure, density,
temperature on the other.  Lawvere in 1982  (SLNM 1174) and in     
1990 (Categories of Space and of Quantity) had proposed to
explain these as modes of variation of quantity. Quantities vary
over a domain of variation in both cases. ( A domain of variation
is a "space" , which in turn is an object in a category of space,
which will be rather more determinate than "category" in general).
An extensive quantity type is a covariant functor from a category
of space, preserving finite coproducts, to a linear category (=
one in which coproducts and products coincide). A distribution,
a measure, a current, a homology class on a sum domain is
given by a tuple of such , one on each summand ; thus all these
are elements of extensive quantity types. An intensive quantity
type is a contravariant functor from a category of space which
also takes coproducts to products ; but more: intensive quantities
usually act linearly on extensive quantities, lending them (not only
a linear but also a) multiplicative structure which is also preserved 
by the contravariant functorality. For example, functions act as
densities on distributions and measures, similarly differential 
forms act on currents, and cohomology classes act on homology classes. 
Often intensive quantity types are representable and related extensive
types are definable  as linear duals ( Riesz, Pontrjagin, Eilenberg- Mac
Lane etc),but these are not the only possibilities.

A fundamental example of a linear "category" is the 2-category of
all categories with coproducts; it has an obvious abstraction functor
to the linear category of commutative monoids, by taking isomorphism-
classes. Part of the idea of K-theory and of K-homology and of  
the "non-linear K-theory" which I with Schanuel and others have been
pursuing under the name of "objective number theory" is that it is
useful to "objectify" quantities by lifting their type across this
abstraction functor. 

The most fundamental measure of a thing is the thing itself. But measures
can be pushed-forward ( a common colloquial expression for the covariant
functorality of extensive quantity).However pullback is more familiar
(already in 1844 Grassmann complained that intensives were more familiar
than Ausdehnungen) :  On any category with pullbacks, there is the 
contravariant functor to cat which takes the "slice" categories
of each object.This functor is commonly viewed as consisting if
"functions", namely functions whose values are the fibers. Indeed if the
category satisfies suitable conditions , this will be an intensive
quantity type. But what extensives will it act on ?

On any category at all the slice categories constitute an even simpler
covariant  cat-valued functor, simply composing the transforming map
following the structural map to define the new structural map. It is
often appropriate to consider that the structural map distributes
the total in the base ( though distributions usually do not have values
at points, they do often have totals ) and that the mentioned composing
pushes the distribution forward. Indeed if the category has coproducts,
this naive pushing forward is automatically linear.
 
Thus a category with coproducts defines an extensive quantity type on
itself if and only if it is an extensive category.


If we call lextensive any extensive category with (finite) limits, then
also by pullback, the intensives act on the extensives in a way that
satisfies all reasonable functoralities, including the crucial CCR
or "projection formula". More exactly, note that there will typically be
lots of subcategories of such a "category of space" which are extensive
but do not themselves have products or even a terminal object;
it suffices to be closed under sums and summands. Namely the empty
space together with all spaces of dimension exactly 7. Any such
subcategory A defines the extensive quantity type "distributions  
of A-dimensional spaces " in each base space X, namely the subslice
category. Given A and B  two extensive subcategories, there is an
objective intensive quantity type which acts roughly as " B-A dimensional
cohomology" namely for any X consider the category of all those spaces
over X such that for any space over X whose total is in A, the pullback
has total in B ; this pulls back along any  change of X.

Of course many extensive subcategories of a (lextensive) category of space
will have products, for example (as Joyal pointed out to me in 1984)
if A=B is the "compact" objects , thus defining the extensive notion
of distributing a compact object in a base space, the corresponding 
intensive quantities which act on these are the proper fiberings
.

From: John C. Mitchell <Mitchell@CS.Stanford.EDU>


JACM is the flagship technical journal of the ACM. As recent additions
to the Editorial Board, we would like encourage the submission of first-rate 
papers in the areas of programming languages and logic in computer science,
broadly construed.

Although the purpose of this message is to encourage submissions, JACM still 
has a moderate backlog. Space constraints only allow for publication of 3-5 
papers per year in each of the main areas of computer science. As a result, 
only a handful of the most exciting or innovative papers from conferences 
like LICS, POPL, ICFP and PLDI could be considered in any given year. Within 
these constraints, we would like to see JACM cover as many active research
areas as possible. 

Submissions may be in the form of postscript files, sent to the Editor-in-Chief 
(see http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~jacm/) or area editors by electronic mail.
Paper submission is also possible.

Subject: 2-Hilbert spaces

Here is the abstract of a paper I wrote:

Higher-Dimensional Algebra II: 2-Hilbert Spaces

A 2-Hilbert space is a category with structures and properties
analogous to those of a Hilbert space.  More precisely, we define a
2-Hilbert space to be an abelian category enriched over Hilb with a
*-structure, conjugate-linear on the hom-sets, satisfying
<fg,h> = <g,f*h> = <f,hg*>.  We also define monoidal, braided monoidal, 
and symmetric monoidal versions of 2-Hilbert spaces, which we call
2-H*-algebras, braided 2-H*-algebras, and symmetric 2-H*-algebras, and
we describe the relation between these and tangles in 2, 3, and 4
dimensions, respectively.  We prove a generalized Doplicher-Roberts
theorem stating that every symmetric 2-H*-algebra is equivalent to the
category Rep(G) of continuous unitary finite-dimensional representations
of some compact supergroupoid G.  The equivalence is given by a
categorified version of the Gelfand transform; we also construct a
categorified version of the Fourier transform when G is a compact
abelian group.  Finally, we characterize Rep(G) by its universal
properties when G is a compact classical group.  For example, Rep(U(n))
is the free connected symmetric 2-H*-algebra on one even object of
dimension n. 

This paper is long and contains pictures and diagrams, so I have
made a compressed Postscript file of it available at

It is also available by anonymous ftp to math.ucr.edu, where it is the
file 2hilb.ps.Z in the directory pub/baez.  On UNIX systems, at least,
one can download it and then uncompress it by typing 

uncompress 2hilb.ps.Z

If any of this presents a problem, email your address to

PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

The seventh biennial conference on Category Theory and Computer
Science is to be held in Santa Margherita Ligure in 1997.  Previous
meetings have been held in Guildford, Edinburgh, Manchester, Paris,
Amsterdam and Cambridge.

SCOPE. The purpose of the conference series is the advancement of the
foundations of computing using the tools of category theory, algebra,
geometry and logic.  Whilst the emphasis is upon applications of
category theory, it is recognized that the area is highly
interdisciplinary and the organizing committee welcomes submissions in
related areas. Topics central to the conference include:

       * Models of computation
       * Program logics and specification
       * Type theory and its semantics
       * Domain theory
       * Linear logic and its applications
       * Categorical programming

Submissions purely on category theory are also acceptable as long as
the applicability to computing is evident.  It is anticipated that the
proceedings will be published in the LNCS series.

IMPORTANT DATES:
- 15 Feb 1997, soft deadline for notification of intention
- 01 Mar 1997, deadline for submissions
- 01 May 1997, notification of acceptance/rejection                         
- 15 Jun 1997, deadline for final version

ORGANIZING AND PROGRAMME COMMITTEE:
S. Abramsky (UK) P.-L. Curien (France), P. Dybjer (Sweden),
P. Johnstone (UK), G. Longo (France), G. Mints (USA), J. Mitchell
(USA), E. Moggi (Italy), A. Pitts (UK), A. Poigne (Germany),
G. Rosolini (Italy), D. Rydeheard (UK), F-J. de Vries (Japan).

PRELIMINARY LIST OF INVITED SPEAKERS:
J. Baez, Univ. of California at Riverside (USA)
R. Bird, Oxford Univ. (UK)
B. Jay, Univ. of Technology Sydney (Australia)

ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
* Papers must describe original unpublished research, be written and
  presented in English, they must not exceed 20 pages nor be submitted
  for publication elsewhere.
* papers should be sent by email to ctcs97@disi.unige.it in postscript
  format, with a separate text message containing: title, authors,
  abstract, keywords, and address of corresponding author.
* Alternative methods of submission might be accepted, but should be
  agreed in advance with ctcs97@disi.unige.it.

FURTHER INFORMATION is available from the conference URL.  Information
on local arrangements is still preliminary, and will be finalized in
May 1997, at the time of the call for participation.

From: F William Lawvere <wlawvere@ACSU.Buffalo.EDU>


The following is an improved version of the text sent Thurs. Any
suggestions for further improvements will be welcome . Note that
the distinction between the objective  extensive and the objective
intensive is essentially "sampling/sorting" distinction discussed in
Conceptual Mathematics.     Bill



The term   EXTENSIVE was applied to certain categories in 1991
by Carboni, Lawvere, and Walters on the basis of the following
considerations.

For centuries, mathematical philosophy has distinguished between
extensive quantities and intensive quantities, for example in
thermodynamics of inhomogeneous bodies, volume, mass, energy, and
entropy on the one hand are distinguished from pressure, density,
temperature on the other.  Lawvere in 1982  (SLNM 1174) and in
1990 (Categories of Space and of Quantity) had proposed to
explain these as modes of variation of quantity. Quantities vary
over a domain of variation in both cases. ( A domain of variation is a
"space" , 
which in turn is an object in a category of space,
which will be rather more determinate than "category" in general).
An extensive quantity type is a covariant functor from a category
of space, preserving finite coproducts, to a linear category (=
one in which coproducts and products coincide). A distribution,
a measure, a current, a homology class on a sum domain is
given by a tuple of such , one on each summand ; thus all these
are elements of extensive quantity types. An intensive quantity
type is a contravariant functor from a category of space which
also takes coproducts to products ; but more:  intensive quantities
usually act linearly on extensive quantities, lending them (not only
a linear but also a) multiplicative structure which is also preserved
by the contravariant functorality. For example, functions act as
densities on distributions and measures, similarly differential
forms act on currents, and cohomology classes act on homology classes.
Often intensive quantity types are representable and related extensive
types are definable  as linear duals ( Riesz, Pontrjagin, Eilenberg- Mac
Lane etc),but these are not the only possibilities.

A fundamental example of a linear "category" is the 2-category of
all categories with coproducts; it has an obvious abstraction functor
to the linear category of commutative monoids, by taking isomorphism-
classes. Part of the idea of K-theory and of K-homology and of
the "non-linear K-theory" which I with Schanuel and others have been
pursuing under the name of "objective number theory" is that it is
useful to "objectify" quantities by lifting their type across this
abstraction functor.

The most fundamental measure of a thing is the thing itself. But measures
can be pushed-forward ( a common colloquial expression for the covariant
functorality of extensive quantity).However pullback is more familiar
(already in 1844 Grassmann complained that intensives were more familiar
than Ausdehnungen) :  On any category with pullbacks, there is the
contravariant functor to cat which takes the "slice" categories
of each object.This functor is commonly viewed as consisting of
"functions", namely functions whose values are the fibers. Indeed if the
category satisfies suitable conditions , this will be an intensive
quantity type. But what extensives will it act on ?

On any category at all the slice categories constitute an even simpler
COVARIANT  cat-valued functor, simply composing the transforming map
following the structural map to define the new structural map. It is
often appropriate to consider that the structural map distributes
the total in the base ( though distributions usually do not have values
at points, they do often have totals ) and that the mentioned composing
pushes the distribution forward. Indeed if the category has coproducts,
this naive pushing forward is automatically linear.( But even though the 
slice categories have terminal objects, these are not preserved by
the relevant extensive functorality.)

THUS A CATEGORY WITH COPRODUCTS DEFINES
 AN EXTENSIVE QUANTITY TYPE ON ITSELF 
IF AND ONLY IF IT IS AN EXTENSIVE CATEGORY.


If we call lextensive any extensive category with (finite) limits, then
also by pullback, the intensives act on the extensives in a way that
satisfies all reasonable functoralities, including the crucial CCR
or "projection formula". More exactly, note that there will typically be
lots of subcategories of such a "category of space" which are extensive
but do not themselves have products or even a terminal object ;
it suffices to be closed under sums and summands. Namely the empty
space together with all spaces of dimension exactly 7. Any such
subcategory A defines the extensive quantity type "distributions
of A-dimensional spaces " in each base space X, namely the subslice
category. Given A and B  two extensive subcategories, there is an
objective intensive quantity type which acts roughly as " B-A dimensional
cohomology" namely for any X consider the category of all those spaces
over X such that for any space over X whose total is in A, the pullback
has total in B ; this pulls back along any  change of X.

Of course many extensive subcategories of a (lextensive) category of space
will have products, for example (as Joyal pointed out to me in 1984)
if A=B is the "compact" objects , thus defining the extensive notion
of distributing a compact object in a base space, the corresponding
intensive quantities which act on these are the PROPER fiberings.
