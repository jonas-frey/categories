Boole.Stanford.EDU, in whose /pub directory one can find the Structures
Directory, /pub/structdir, is also where you can find /pub/ABSTRACTS,
listing the abstracts of some fifty papers written by members of my
group over the past ten years, in chronological order.

About a third of these are on Chu spaces.  Their chronological order is
very little help for people hoping to learn more about Chu spaces from
them.  I've therefore reorganized the abstracts of those papers in the
form of a web-browsable guide, accessible as

        http://boole.stanford.edu/chuguide.html

The abstracts are grouped into Introductory (2), Applications (10),
Technical Notes (5), and Prehistory (5).  Each abstract includes a link
to the postscript file, which you can view and/or print if your web
browser knows about gzipped files (.gz) and Postscript (.ps).

I've only listed papers from Stanford, for related papers from
elsewhere see the bibliographies of the introductory papers.  Please
let me know of any difficulties you encounter with this guide.

Fred Linton's comment re Cantor--Bernstein is of course correct,
provided you assume classical logic. However, Barbosa's question
makes sense in any topos with a natural number object, and it's
well known that Cantor--Bernstein can fail in non-Boolean toposes.
Is there always an isomorphism A* x A* =~ (A x 2)* in such a topos?
I suspect the answer is yes, but it may take some ingenuity to
construct it.

There's almost certainly a constructive proof of the
Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem in the circumstances that you
describe, which would necessarily contain a construction of a
bijection given two appropriate injections --- it wouldn't be hard to
makes this as explicit as you like.
If you really want to exhibit this isomorphism explicitly, this
suggests to me that your looking for something like an algorithm: If
this is not the case, then even a non-constructive proof would do if
you're prepared to a allow primitive corresponding to the law of the
excluded middle in the recipe for your isomorphism --- it's just not
always obvious how to interpret this in any computational sense.

Alternatively, you could simply introduce some mutant
lexicographic-type ordering on each of the two sets (using the
ubiquitous `diagonal' trick (that's not diagonalisation) if necessary,
i.e. if A is infinite).

Neither of these suggestions is perceptibly natural or canonical i'm
afraid, but i rather suspect that there is no particularly
distinguished candidate with respect to the level of structure that
you describe.

If we put F(A)=(A* x A*) and G(A)= (A x 2)* for any set A
we obtain two functors F,G:Sets -->Sets.
Are they naturally isomorphic?
This is not the original question but a related one. 
Observe that both functors are analytic, which means that they have
a power series expansion:

 F(A)= sum_n n A^n  and   G(A)= sum_n 2^n A^n

The two power series are different and it follows 
that F is not isomorphic to G.

Andre's analytic functors do it all. As he points out, they answer,
negatively, the question I put (answering it, note, before he could

one I had in mind for the category of strict maps between pointed
sets. Well, yeah, I didn't notice that my "not hard" proof was only 
good for what the CS people call "strict maps." What it comes to is 
that if you first apply the functor  \A. 1+A  and then Andre's 
functors  F , G  you get isomorphic functors:

   ((1+A) x 2)*    =     (1+A)* x (1+A)*

because in each case you get

    sum_n  Nx(A^n).

Andre Joyal's neat argument not only shoots down Peter Freyd's conjectured
extension of Barbosa's question, it also shoots down mine (i.e. does the
isomorphism (A* x A*) =~ (A x 2)* hold for A an object of a non-Boolean
topos with NNO?) Take E to be the object classifier (i.e. the functor
category [Set_f,Set]) and A to be the generic object of this topos (i.e.
the inclusion functor Set_f --> Set). Then (A* x A*) and (A x 2)* are
simply the restrictions to Set_f of Andre's functors F and G, and these
are already non-isomorphic (since both functors are finitary).

>Is there always an isomorphism A* x A* =~ (A x 2)* in such a topos?

If we have a 1-1 correspondance between A and the set N of natural numbers,
then this reduces to N* x N* =~ (N x 2)*, and constructive proofs of N* =~
N and N x N =~ N are easy, so presumably this will work in any topos with a
NNO.

On the other hand, A* x A* =~ (A x 2)* for all A implies excluded middle.
An informal argument follows:

Suppose A* x A* =~ (A x 2)* for all A.  Let phi be a proposition.  We show
phi or not phi.  Take a and b such that a=b iff phi; it suffices to show
a=b or not a=b.  Let A be the set {a,b}.

Let f : (A x 2)* --> A* x A* and g : (A* x A*) --> (A x 2)* be inverse.

We take 2 = {0,1} for convenience.
First look at f applied to x in S = {<(x,0),(y,0),(z,0)> | x,y,z in A}

The images of each of these is in the form (<c_1,...,c_m>,<d_1,...,d_n>).

If either m or n depends on x in S, then f is non-constant, S is not a
singleton, and so not a=b.

Alternatively m, n don't depend on x in S (we're using excluded middle for
equality on natural numbers).  Let T = {(<x_1,...,x_m>,<y_1,...,y_n>) | x,y
in A}.  Consider the g(w) for w in T.  If these are not all in the form
(x,0),(y,0),(z,0), then we have two distinct members of T, so not a=b.
Otherwise, g and f restrict to a bijection between S and T.  If not m+n =
3, then we have A^i =~ A^j with not i=j and it follows that a=b.

Otherwise, we are left with m+n=3.

We now repeat with this with S = {<(x,i),(y,j),(z,k)>|x,y,z in A}, for each
of the other seven possibilities of i,j,k in {0,1}.  There are two
possibilities: either eventually we obtain (a=b or not a=b), or we find for
all 8 triples (i,j,k), some m and n such that m+n=3.  But the latter case
is impossible: as f and g are bijections, different triples (i,j,k) must
give different pairs (m,n), a contradiction as there are eight triples, but
only four pairs.

[We've implicitly used the following fact: If n is a natural number, and
psi(x) is decideable for all x in A^n, then psi(x) for all x in A^n, is
also decidable]

I would like to correct an error in my power series expansion of
A* x A*. You might have already noticed it.
The correct expansion is

   A* x A* = sum_n (n+1) x A^n

Of course, the error does not affect the proof
that A* x A* is not isomorphic to (2 x A)*
as a functor from Sets to Sets.

Peter is right about the isomorphism between the functors
F(X+1) and G(X+1) where F(A)=A* x A* and G(A)=(2 x A)*.

It might be worth to notice that
if we substitute the category Sets, of sets and all maps, 
by the category Bi of sets and bijections then
F and G become isomorphic as functors Bi -->Sets.
In this case Cantor's argument applies since the
category of functors Bi-->Sets is a Boolean topos
(and since there are natural injections F>-->G
and G>-->F in this category).

However, if we substitute the category Sets by
the category In of sets and injections then it can be shown
F and G are not isomorphic as functors In -->Sets.

Given total enumerations of A and B (in other words bijections N -> A
and N -> B), there are standard ("canonical") constructions that
produce total enumerations of A*, A x 2, A x B, and so on, using
primitive recursive functions, which are thus available in any topos
with natural numbers object.  For example, the Cantor Pairing Function

    <x,y> = ((x+y)^2 + 3x + y)/2

is a bijection N x N -> N.  (In fact, by the Fueter-Polya theorem, it
is the unique such bijection up to swapping x and y that is given by a
quadratic polynomial with real coefficients.)  Similarly, the function
mapping N* to N given by the dyadic coding

    <a0,...,an> |-> 2^a0 + 2^{a0+a1+1} + ... + 2^{a0+...+an + n}

(the empty sequence is coded by 0) is a "primitive recursive"
bijection in the extended sense where lists are a recursive data
type.

By appropriately composing these enumerations and their inverses, one
gets canonical bijections between any two sets built from totally
enumerated sets using x, *, and so on, by going from one of the sets
back to N and then from N to the other set.

Master Class 1996-1997

Mathematical Research Institute
The Mathematical Research Institute (MRI) in The Netherlands has been set up
jointly by the mathematics departments of the universities of Groningen,
Nijmegen, Twente and Utrecht. Its aim is to promote research, organise graduate
courses and seminars, and stimulate international contacts and exchange. The
MRI is one of the main mathematical institutes in The Netherlands.
 Master Class
The MRI organises a Master Class (MC). Every year three parallel MC programmes
are offered, each with its own topic. These are 1-year programmes of lectures,
seminars and a test problem
for bright undergraduate students and beginning graduate students of any
nationality. The MC student follows one of these programmes. The language for
all MC activities is English.

Students who have successfully completed a Master Class programme can apply for
admission to the Graduate Studies Programme (GSP) of the MRI. Studies in the
GSP can take 4 years and aim at a doctoral thesis, based on original
mathematical research. Admission to the GSP is subject to a severe selection
procedure.

Topics for the Master Class 1996-97
# Numerical Analysis and Supercomputing
# Stochastics and Operations Research
# Complex Geometry and Topology

 Each programme includes
# two full days of lectures and seminars per week,
# a test problem: individual work on a mathematical
problem under the guidance of a tutor.

The programme runs from September 1st until June 30th. There are two blocks of
courses of about thirteen weeks each. Participants are
expected to become actively involved in seminars, workshops, discussions.
Time will also be reserved for preparing for the examinations and for work on
the test
problem.

In 1996-97 the following courses will be offered:

NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND SUPERCOMPUTING
# Seminar: Numerical solution of nonlinear problems (O. Axelsson)
# Finite element and boundary element methods (B. Polman)
# Splines and wavelets (C. Traas)
# Numerical treatment of surfacewaves (P. Zandbergen)
# Subspace methods for linear problems and eigenproblems (H. van der Vorst/G.
Sleijpen)
# Seminar: Preconditioning techniques (H. van der Vorst/G. Sleijpen)
# Elliptic boundary value problems (J. Duistermaat)
# either: Numerical programming (R. Bisseling)
or: Supercomputers and numerical linear algebra (O. Axelsson)

STOCHASTICS AND OPERATIONS RESEARCH
# Algorithmic methods in mathematical operations research (U. Faigle, W. Kern)
# Seminar: Stochastic models in applied operations research (W. Nawijn)
# Stochastic processes (M. van Zuijlen, E. van Doorn)
# Stochastic analysis (F. den Hollander, H. Maassen)
# Non-parametric statistics (B. Levit)
# Seminar: Quantum stochastics (R. Gill)
# Time series analysis (H. Dehling, T. Mikosch)
# Seminar: Spatial stochastics (H. Dehling, A. van Enter, J. Roerdink)

COMPLEX GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY
# Sheaves and algebraic topology (W. van der Kallen, I. Moerdijk)
# Complex geometry (E. Looijenga)
# Riemann-Hilbert correspondence on  P^1 (F. Beukers, G. Heckman)
# Introduction to singularities (D. Siersma, J. Steenbrink)
# D-modules (J. Steenbrink, R. van Doorn)
# Intersection homology (W. van der Kallen, I. Moerdijk)
# Arrangements of hyperplanes (M. Hazewinkel, D. Siersma) # Seminar on
hypergeometric functions (G. Heckman, E. Opdam, J.
Stienstra)

Examination and certificate
Each participant is required to take examinations on the courses and to present
a written account of his/her work on the test problem. When the examinations
and the test problem are successfully passed a
certificate will be awarded.

Expenses and fellowships
The fee for admission to the MC, including tuition fees, is Dfl. 5,000.
Since the MC activities take place in different cities the participants should
expect expenses up to Dfl. 1,500 per year for travelling in the Netherlands.
Moreover, there will be expenses for visa and for travelling to and from the
Netherlands.
The other normal costs of living (including housing and insurance) can be
estimated at Dfl. 1,200 per month.

The MRI can only offer a very limited number of fellowships for
participation in the MC.
Foreign students are therefore requested to apply for scholarships or funding
in their
home country. The MRI also encourages participation by way of student exchange
programmes. Students are requested to check if their home university
is involved in exchange programmes with one of the MRI universities (Groningen,
Nijmegen, Twente, Utrecht).
The MRI can offer a few full fellowships, intended for students
with no possibility of funding in their home country and a few partial
fellowships, intended for students with limited funding. In some
cases the admission fee will be waived.

Housing
The MC activities will be spread over the four participating
universities. The MRI will help candidates to find suitable
housing accommodation near one of the participating universities. Usually one
day per week the student will travel to another
university. Travelling can take up to two and a half hours each way.

Application
Application is open to all those who are now in the final year of their
undergraduate studies in Mathematical Sciences or have started their graduate
studies. Women are especially encouraged to apply.
To apply one should complete (a copy of) the application form attached
to this folder and send it together with the following documents to Jean
Arthur:

# Curriculum vitae.
# Academic record: list  of
subjects/classes taken at the home university; subjects for degree examination;
photocopy of diploma (if available).
# At least one letter of recommendation from a member of the academic staff of
the home university.
# A summary of the applicant's financial circumstances (if a fellowship is
being applied for).
N.B.:
incomplete applications will not be considered;
clearly indicate the topic of your choice;
there are no special application forms for fellowships or housing.

Hypatia is at Queen Mary and Westfield College in London's East End.

Hypatia is a directory of research workers in computer science and
mathematics, and a library of their papers. It contains material
which has been published by placing it on a publicly accessible web or
ftp site, and a certain amount of "public domain" information about
authors (name, affiliation, email address and phone number, etc).  It
also assembles bibliographic information.

Hypatia is not a web crawler, but a mirrored archive with a web interface. 
The archive is indexed by author and by research group, and is equipped 
with a search engine. 

Hypatia works by having a database of registered authors. Many of the
readers of this message will already be on the database. You can find
out if you are on our database simply by searching for yourself in
Hypatia. If you are not, then you can register and ensure that your
papers are lodged in Hypatia simply by filling in an electronic form,
which you can obtain via the Hypatia home page. If you are already registered,
then you can use the same form to correct any incorrect or out of date
information we have about you. (Inevitably, and despite our best efforts,
not all the information on Hypatia's database will be correct.)

You can use the same form on behalf of your colleagues to help expand
Hypatia's coverage.

Hypatia would also like to encourage you to compile a BibTeX-format
database of your own papers. We hope that this will help people to
cite accurately the definitive versions of your work. On-line help for
this is available.

Hypatia has been implemented by Mark Dawson, who set up and ran
the popular mirrored archive at theory,doc.ic.ac.uk.
Mark has benefited from discussions with Paul Taylor. 

Hypatia is still under development and welcomes your comments, suggestions,

	Hom(A,B) iso HOM(B^\perp , A^\perp)

where B^\perp is the dual of B etc.

The question is, if you there is another isomorphism of Hom sets
	Hom(A,B) iso HOM(B,A)

Does this force the duality to become trivial, i.e. A^\perp iso A for
all A?

I suspect the answer is no, but something tells me it might be yes. But
my intuition and attempts to resolve the matter have, so far, failed me.

The answer is no. Take a closed symmetric monoidal category C which
happens to be self-dual (e.g. finite-dimensional vector spaces), and
perform (the trivial case of) the Chu construction on it -- i.e.
take C^op x C with the duality (A,B)^\perp = (B,A).

There answer is no.  One point to remember is that the category
could even be discrete, that is the only arrows are identities.
An easy example is this.  Let G be a group (and assume not every element
is of order dividing 2).  If you want a symmetric example, assume G is
commutative.  Now make a category whose objects are the elements of G
and arrows are only identities, so there is an arrow a --> b iff a = b
and then there is only one.  So Hom(a,b) = Hom(b,a).  The monoidal
structure is the group multiplication, a --o b = a\inv b (and
b o-- a = b a\inv) and a* = a\inv.  

Here is a less trivial example.  Take a CMC with finite products
in which Hom(a,b) \iso Hom(b,a) (finite dimensional vector spaces,
say) and form Chu(C,1) (1 is terminal).  An object is a pair (a,a')
where a and a' are arbitrary objects of C and Hom((a,a'),(b,b'))=
Hom(a,b) x Hom(b',a') \iso Hom(b,a) x Hom(a',b') = Hom((b,b'),(a,a')),
while (a,a')* = (a',a).

			Postdoctoral positions at BRICS


There are several postdoctoral positions at BRICS for a period of one to two
years starting next year, 1997.  Applications by researchers are welcome in the
areas of logic, semantics, algorithms and complexity theory.  Applications for
positions should preferably be sent by e-mail and include curriculum vitae and
two or three names of referees for recommendations as well as the referees'
regular mail addresses and, if possible, e-mail addresses (see below).


BRICS, a Centre for Basic Research in Computer Science, is funded by the
Danish National Research Foundation for the period 1994-1998.  Its aim is
to establish in Denmark important areas of basic research in the
mathematical foundations of Computer Science, notably Algorithmics
(including Complexity Theory) and Mathematical Logic.  The Centre is to
develop these areas as a joint effort between the theoretical-computer-
science groups at Aarhus University and Aalborg University.  The research
plan is based on a committment to develop Algorithms and Complexity Theory,
and Logic integrated with existing strong activities in Semantics of
Computation, using a combination of long-term efforts and a number of
short-term, intensive programmes, within carefully chosen scientific
themes. Organizationally, BRICS is an autonomous centre with its own
management, and yet with its activities strongly integrated in the existing
infrastructure and student environments at the two universities.

The scientific planning is the responsibility of the following committee:


  	Glynn Winskel, Professor (Aarhus), Director
  	Mogens Nielsen, Associate Professor (Aarhus), Codirector
  	Erik Meineche Schmidt, Associate Professor (Aarhus), Codirector
  	Uffe Engberg, (Aarhus), Project Manager
  	Kim Guldstrand Larsen, Professor (Aalborg)
  	Peter D.Mosses, Associate Professor (Aarhus)
  	Michael Schwartzbach, Associate Professor (Aarhus)
  	Arne Skou, Associate Professor (Aalborg)
  	Sven Skyum, Associate Professor, Reader (Aarhus)

Dear people,

The May 27, 1996 revision of `From Horn clause to Makkai sketch
resolution' is now at (linked to, indirectly linked to)

1.  Axiom templates are gone.  This simplifies the main result ---
lifting (for l.f.p. logic programming) --- and eliminates a section.

2.  The examples are greatly improved.  Even and + are added and head
consolidation is gone.

3.  Some terminology is improved and more motivation is added.

Regards, Jim Otto
