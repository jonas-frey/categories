1. M. Grandis, Categorically algebraic foundations for homotopical algebra,
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 293 (1996).

Abstract. We investigate a structure for an abstract cylinder endofunctor 
I  which produces a good basis for homotopical algebra. It essentially
consists of the usual operations (faces, degeneracies, connections,
symmetries, composition) together with a transformation  I^2 -> I^2, 
which we call lens collapse after its realisation in the standard
topological case.
This structure, if somewhat heavy, has the interest of being
"categorically algebraic", i.e. based on operations on functors.
Consequently, it can be naturally lifted from a category  A  to its
categories of diagrams  A^S  and its slice categories  A\X,  A/X.  Further,
the dual structure, based on a cocylinder (or path) endofunctor  P  can be
lifted to the category of  A-valued sheaves on a site, whenever  P 
preserves limits, and to the category of internal monoids in  A,  with
respect to any monoidal structure of  A  consistent with  P.


2. M. Grandis, On the homotopy structure of strongly homotopy associative
differential algebras,  Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 294 (1996).

Abstract.   We study here the homotopy structure of  Shad,  the
category of strongly homotopy associative d-algebras (shad-algebras for
short), also called A_infinity-algebras and introduced by Stasheff ([St],
1963) for the study of the singular complex of the loop-space of a pointed 
topological space.
   Shad  extends the category  Da  of associative differential
(graded) algebras, by allowing for a homotopy relaxation of objects and
morphisms, up to systems of homotopies of arbitrary degree. The
better known category  Dash  of associative differential algebras and
strongly homotopy multiplicative maps (Stasheff-Halperin [StH], Munkholm
[Mu1-4]), having strict objects (the ones of  Da)  and lax morphisms (the
ones of  Shad)  is intermediate between them. A crucial advantage of  Shad 
over its subcategories  Dash  and  Da  is the homotopy invariance property
proved by Gugenheim - Stasheff [GuS].
   In order to study shad-homotopies of any order and their
operations, the usual cocylinder functor of d-algebras is here extended to 
Shad,  where we construct the vertical composition and reversion of
homotopies (also existing in  Dash,  but not in  Da)  and homotopy
pullbacks (which exist in  Da,  but not in  Dash).
   Shad  acquires thus a laxified version of the homotopy structure
studied by the author in previous works; the main results therein,
developing homotopical algebra from the Puppe sequence to stabilisation and
triangulated structures, can very likely be extended to the new axioms, so
to be available for  Shad.

From: Dan Christensen <jdchrist@math.mit.edu>

Dear category theorists,

  I have been working on a problem in stable homotopy theory that led
to a question about the vanishing of the higher derived functors of
the inverse limit functor.  I was wondering if anyone on this list
can answer it.

  Let G be any abelian group and let {G_\alpha} be the filtered
  diagram of all the finitely generated subgroups of G.  Apply a
  contravariant additive functor T : Ab --> Ab to the diagram to
  produce {T G_\alpha}.  Is it always true that lim^i T G_\alpha 
  is zero for i at least 2?

If G is countable, then this is true, and if T takes finitely generated
groups to finitely generated groups, then it is true.  But is it
true in general?

  I should say that I have certain examples of T that I care about,
namely TA = [HA,HB]_k (k and B fixed), the abelian group of maps from
HA, the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum with group A in dimension 0, to
\Sigma^k HB, the E-M spectrum with group B in dimension k.  However, I
was hoping that it would be enough to use the abstract information we
have.  For example, the shape of the inverse system is "Noetherian" in
a certain sense (because it comes from a diagram of finitely generated
subgroups of a group) and while the objects in the diagram need not be
finitely generated, they are finite sums of abelian groups chosen from
a countable list.

  Thanks for any help or references you can provide.  I have looked
through several things written by Roos, Jensen and others and nothing
answers the question either positively or negatively.

                A REQUEST FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

As previously announced, there will be a Seminar for Max Kelly on
12-13 March. On the Tuesday night there will be a dinner at which
some words will be spoken. Because so many category theorists will
be unable to attend the seminar and dinner, I decided to ask those
of you who know Max personally, or have been influenced by his
mathematical research, to send me some thoughts about Max that I
can share with the people at the dinner. I have in mind between a few
sentences and two paragraphs in length. Max is very proud of his
international contacts and friends so I think this would be a
very fitting tribute to him.

Please send your contributions to me at <street@mpce.mq.edu.au>.
I look forward to hearing from you, if possible, before the end
of February.

Kind regards,
Ross

PS We are trying to avoid having this message sent to Max.

will be invited for submission (in full version) to a special issue of the
Journal (http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/igpl/Journal).

The location:
Salvador, Capital of the Bahia state, the first European settlement of
Portuguese America and the first Capital of Brazil, is where all the most
important colonial buildings were constructed: churches, convents, palaces,
forts and many other monuments.  Part of the city historical center has been
safekept by UNESCO since 1985. Five hundred years of blending Native American,
Portuguese, and African influences have left a rich culture to its people, which
can be felt on its music, food, and mysticism.  Salvador is located on the
northeastern coast of Brazil and the sun shines year round with the average
temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.  It is surrounded by palm trees and beaches
with warm water.  City population is around 2.5 million and life style is quite
relaxed.

           3rd Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation
                                (WoLLIC'96)
                              May 8-10, 1996

                  TITLE AND ABSTRACT OF INVITED TALKS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some Semantical Aspects of Linear Logic
Andreas Blass

I plan to discuss some of the semantics that have been proposed for Girard's
linear logic, including different forms of game semantics, de Paiva's
Dialectica-like semantics, and perhaps others.  I shall describe how these
semantics are related to each other, to the intuitions that underlie linear
logic, and to some other parts of mathematics.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trees, Ordinals, and Termination
Nachum Dershowitz

Trees are a natural representation for countable ordinals.  We describe natural
well-founded orderings of finite binary trees, finite ordered (plane-planted)
trees, rational binary trees (finite or infinite binary trees with only finitely
many different subtrees), and "supertrees" (trees whose nodes may themselves be
supertrees). We relate these orderings to existing ordinal notations, and
illustrate their use in various colorful termination problems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proof Theory and Semantics for Structurally Free Logics
J. Michael Dunn

This work is joint with R. K. Meyer. The idea is to provide a semantics and
proof theory for combinatory logic, extended by a "residual" (implication). The
semantics is a variation on the ternary relational (Meyer-Routley) semantics for
relevance logic, as extended by Meyer-Routley, and more recently others for the
(fusion-implication) fragment of the relevance logic B+ (closely related to the
non-associative Lambek calculus). The proof-theory extends some semi-published
work of Meyer in the 1970's (following a suggestion of Belnap), wherein
Gentzen's structural rules for the intuitionistic implication calculus were
replacewith explicit introduction of a combinator licensing the combinatorial
manipulations.  This is extended so as to make combinators "first-class
objects," and a cut theorem can still be proven.

This is called "structurally free logic" in analogy with "logic freed of
existential presppositions." In this original "free logic," existence
presuppositions are made explicit, just as in "combinatorially free logic"
combinatorial moves are made explicit by adding the combinators that license
them as explicit premisses in the antecedent of the sequent. This allows various
logics to be translated into the combinatorially free logic. It also expands the
meaning of "substructural logics" beyond the usual ones obtained by considering
various subsets of Gentzen's structural rules (plus say associativity). There
will also be results about adding other connectives (conjunction and
disjunction), with or without distribution.

Update Semantics Meets Discourse
Jeroen Groenendijk

In update semantics the meaning of a sentence is identified with its potential
to change the information state of an agent. In the recursive semantic
definition, truth conditions are replaced by update effects.  Central notions
are not truth and validity, but consistency, support, and coherence.

Although update semantics is advertized as addressing itself to the
interpretation of discourse, rather than being limited to single sentences,
it usually goes no further than interpreting sequences of utterances of a single
agent. In the present talk I will study the interpretation of multi-agent
discourse. The object language we investigate is the language of modal predicate
logic. We concentrate on the role of (epistemic) modalities in discourse, and on
anaphoric relations (binding of variables) across utterances of different
speakers. The aim is to characterize notions of logical consistency and
coherence of multi-agent discourse.

The paper reports on joint work with Martin Stokhof and Frank Veltman.

Verifying Timed and Hybrid Systems
Amir Pnueli

The talk presents new computational models for real-time and hybrid systems.
For timed systems we propose a model called A Clocked Transition System (CTSS).
The CTSS model is a development of our previous Timed Transition model, where
some of the changes are inspired by the model of Timed Automata.  The new models
lead to a simpler style of temporal specification and verification, requiring
no extension of the temporal language.  We present verification rules for
proving safety properties (including time-bounded response properties) of
clocked transition systems, and separate rules for proving (time-unbounded)
response properties.  To justify the need for time-unbounded resopnse rules, we
present a characteristic example of a timed system which terminates but no
apriori bound on its termination time can be given All rules are associated with
verification diagrams.  The verification of RESPONSE properties requires
adjustments of the proof rules developed for untimed systems, reflecting the
fact that progress in the real time systems is ensured by the progress of time
and not by fairness.

The style of the verification rules is very close to the verification style of
untimed systems which allows the (re)use of verification methods and tools,
developed for untimed reactive systems, for proving properties of real-time
systems.

We conclude with the presentation of a branching-time based approach for
verifying that an arbitrary given CTSS is Non-Zeno.

This is joint work with Y. Kesten and Z. Manna.

{\bf WoLLIC'96} is part of a larger biennial event in computer
science being held in the campus of the Federal University of Bahia from the
6th to the 10th of May 1996: the {\bf 6th SEMINFO} (6th Informatics Week).  The
{\bf 6th SEMINFO} will involve parallel sessions, tutorials, mini-courses, as
well as the {\bf XI Brazilian Conference on Mathematical Logic} ({\bf EBL'96}),
and a {\bf Workshop on Distributed Systems} ({\bf WoSiD'96}).\\
{\bf Submission}:
Two-page abstracts, preferably by e-mail to ***~wollic96@di.ufpe.br~*** must be
RECEIVED by MARCH 8th, 1996 by the Chair of the Organising Committee. Authors
will be notified of acceptance by April 8th, 1996.  The {\bf 3rd WoLLIC'96} is
officially sponsored by the Interest Group in Pure and Applied Logics (IGPL) and
The European Association for Logic, Language and Information (FoLLI).
The {\bf EBL'96} is the annual meeting of Brazilian Logic Society.
Abstracts will be published in the Journal of the IGPL (ISSN 0945-9103)
(up to now produced and distributed by Imperial College, London, and
Max-Planck-Institut, Saarbr\"ucken, but soon to be distributed by
Oxford University Press) as part of the meeting report.
Selected contributed papers will be invited for submission (in full
version) to a special issue of the Journal
(http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/igpl/Journal).\\
{\bf The location}:
Salvador, Capital of the Bahia state, the first European settlement of
Portuguese America and the first Capital of Brazil, is where all the most
important colonial buildings were constructed: churches, convents, palaces,
forts and many other monuments.  Part of the city historical center has been
safekept by UNESCO since 1985. Five hundred years of blending Native American,
Portuguese, and African influences have left a rich culture to its people, which
can be felt on its music, food, and mysticism.  Salvador is located on the
northeastern coast of Brazil and the sun shines year round with the average
temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.  It is surrounded by palm trees and beaches
with warm water.  City population is around 2.5 million and life style is quite
relaxed.\\

I remember the time when the only people who could pronounce
the word "functor" without either a sneer or an apologetic little
snort were a few homological algebraists. The first exception
I knew was Paul Halmos. Among other things, he became the single
best salesman for my first book. All of which is a preamble for
my forwarding of the following:

Subject: Halmos = 80

         As you may know, Paul will celebrate his 80th birthday on
Sunday March 3rd. I am organizing an email blitz for the occasion, the
idea being to deluge the old gent on that day with electronic birthday
greetings from near and far. You are invited to join the fun. Halmos's
address is
                phalmos@scuacc.scu.edu

      We are all allowed to add any other mathematicians (or
nonmathematicians) we think of. Duplications are inevitable in any
case, but that is no problem. I suggest notifying people at least a
week in advance of H-Day.

        People without access to email on a Sunday should wait until
Monday the 4th to send their greetings.

        Len

Venue
-----

The CAAP/ESOP/CC conferences will be hosted by Linkvping University in
April 1996.  Organised by the Programming Environments Laboratory at
the Department of Computer and Information Science, the conferences
will be held in the Collegium building at the Mjdrdevi Science Park,
near the University campus.  Accommodation is available at several
downtown hotels.

Linkvping is the fifth largest city in Sweden and has about 130,000
inhabitants. It is located about 200 kilometres southwest of
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden.

There are airports in Linkvping and Norrkvping (40 kilometres from
Linkvping) with regular flights from Copenhagen and Stockholm. One of
the main railways runs from Stockholm through Norrkvping, Linkvping
and further to Malmv in the south of Sweden.  There are also direct
train connections from several European cities.

The weather is in general unpredictable. Temperatures in spring can
vary between 5 and 150C. You are best advised to bring several layers
of clothing which can be put on and taken off as required.

Registration
------------

The registration fee covers lunches, coffee breaks, conference
dinner(s) and proceedings which are to be published by Springer-Verlag
in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  Student fees cover
lunches and proceedings, but not the conference dinner(s).  Extra
dinner tickets will be available for purchase at the conference.

The registration desk is open on Sunday April 21 from 17 to 21 in the

The paper "Frame distributions, and support"
by A. Kock and G.E,. Reyes
is available by anonymous ftp :

ftp://theory.doc.ic.ac.uk/papers/Kock

where it appears as distr.ps.Z

It is a slightly expanded version of the preprint with the same title,
Universite de Montreal DMS No 386, janvier 1996.

Abstract: We analyze in terms of constructive frame theory
the relationship between support of distributions,
regularization of opens, and "frame distributions"
(sup lattice maps from a frame to the frame of truth values,
as considered recently by Bunge and Funk).

The preprint "Locally closed sublocales and prolongation by zero"

where it appears as the file: loc-clo.ps (it is about 150 kb).

Abstract: We prove that abelian group valued sheaves over a locally closed
sublocale admit prolongation by zero, and that the prolongation functor has
a right adjoint. The method is by left exact comonads; specifically, it
uses a version of Artin-Wraith glueing, where one has to put glue on _both_
the items to be glued.

            RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING

A Research Fellow is  required for a 3-year project entitled
``Foundations for the Integration of Concurrent Distributed and
Functional Computation'', under the direction of Prof. M. Hennessy and
funded by the EPSRC.

The aim of the project is to 

- provide a uniform coherent semantic foundation for concurrent,
distributed and functional behaviour;

- develop proof methodologies for establishing properties of process
descriptions expressed in specification languages using these
paradigms;

- develop prototypes of supporting verification systems.

The project will start on 1/4/96 and salary will be related to the
academic 1A scale. A Ph.D. in Computer Science or Mathematics or
equivalent experience is required. In addition to normal research
duties the successful candidate will be expected to provide some 
assistance to undergraduate teaching.

More details of the project and the conditions of service are available
at 

ftp://ftp.cogs.sussex.ac.uk/pub/users/matthewh/details.ps

To apply please submit electronic applications to 


matthewh@cogs.sussex.ac.uk

Applications should include a detailed curriculum vitae, names of
three referees with their email addresses.

Applications are invited for a post-doctoral research fellowship funded
under the UK EPSRC research project "Subtyping, inheritance and reuse:
developing expressive type theory for formal analysis".

The area of work is computer-assisted formal reasoning based on type
theory.  The project is to develop expressive type theories with
subtyping and inheritance mechanisms to support structuring and reuse
of formal theories and proofs.  The theoretical research results will
be incorporated into proof development systems such as Lego and used
in application case studies.

The research fellowship is for a period of three years and available
from May 1996.  The appointment will be on the AR1A scale (starting
salary from 15,986 to 18,294 pounds per annum, according to
experience).  Candidates would normally be expected to have a PhD in
computer science or mathematics, or equivalent experience.  Experience
or background in areas such as constructive type theory, type systems
for programming languages, formal proof development, or implementation
of theorem provers, is considered to be desirable, though not
necessary.

The successful candidate will be working in an active research group
at Durham with interests in both theory and application.  He or she is
also expected to have a close collaboration with the theorem proving
group led by Prof. Rod Burstall at LFCS, Edinburgh (a collaborating
partner of the above project) and other related institutions in
Europe.

Further details of the research project and related information can be
found from the WWW page "http://www.dur.ac.uk/~dcs0zl/sir.html".

Applications should include a curriculum vitae and names of two
referees with their addresses (and email addresses if available).

          Categories for computation in context and unified logic: I

             by R.F. Blute, J.R.B. Cockett, and R.A.G. Seely

Abstract
In this paper we introduce the notion of contextual categories.  These
provide a categorical semantics for the modelling of computation in context,
based on the idea of separating logical sequents into two zones, one
representing the context over which the computation is occurring, the other
the computation itself. The separation into zones is achieved via a
bifunctor equipped with a tensorial strength. We show that a category with
such a functor can be viewed as having an action on itself. With this
interpretation, we obtain a fibration in which the base category consists of
contexts, and the reindexing functors are used to change the context.

We further observe that this structure also provides a framework for
developing categorical semantics for Girard's Unified Logic, a key feature
of which is to separate logical sequents into two zones, one in which
formulas behave classically and one in which they behave linearly.  This
separation is analogous to the context/computation separation above, and is
handled by our semantics in a similar fashion.  Furthermore, our approach
allows an analysis of the exponential structure of linear logic using a
tensorially strong action as the primitive notion. We demonstrate that from
such a structure one can recover a model of the linear storage operator.

Finally, we introduce a sequent calculus for the fragment of Unified Logic
modeled by contextual categories. We show cut elimination for this fragment,
and we introduce a simple notion of proof circuit, which provides a
description of free contextual categories.

               Enrichment and Representation Theorems 
         for Categories of Domains and Continuous Functions

                            Synopsis

Domain-theoretic categories are axiomatised by means of categorical 
non-order-theoretic requirements on a cartesian closed category 
equipped with a commutative monad.  We prove an enrichment theorem 
showing that every axiomatic domain-theoretic category can be endowed 
with an intensional notion of approximation, the path relation, with 
respect to which the category Cpo-enriches. Subsequently, we provide a
representation theorem of the form: every small domain-theoretic 
category (with a lifting monad) has a full and faithful representation
in a domain-theoretic category of cpos and continuous functions (with a
lifting monad) in a suitable intuitionistic set theory.

Our analysis suggests more liberal notions of domains.  In particular,
we present a category where the path order is not omega-complete, but 
in which the constructions of domain theory (as, for example, the 
existence of uniform fixed-point operators and the solution of domain 
equations) are possible.
