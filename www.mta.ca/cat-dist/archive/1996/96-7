Answer to the question of Achim Jung, Mathias Kegelmann & Eike Ritter:

See a paper of Max Kelly in Springer Lecture Notes in Math 420
called "Doctrinal adjunction" pages 257-280. The Proposition
has other clauses: e.g., an adjunction in the 2-category of (symm)
monoidal categories and monoidal functors is exactly of the kind you
describe.

As well as the paper cited by Ross Street, this is mentioned, though
not actually stated as a lemma, on page 15 of the technical report
version of my paper

 A Mixed Linear and Non-Linear Logic: Proofs, Terms and Models
 Technical report 352 University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory
October 1994

I noticed it in connection with a proof-theoretically unpleasant
`adjoint' presentation of LNL logic (Section 3.1.2) in which the
rules for the two functors are just

 F\Theta |- A  (in L)
 ------------
 \Theta |- GA  (in C)

and

 \Theta |- GA  (in C)
 ------------
 F\Theta |- A  (in L)

Since G doesn't appear on the left in either of these rules, it's
not *immediately* clear why G has to behave well with respect to the
monoidal structures interpreting the commas in the antecedents. The
answer is in the lemma above.

      ACSC'97 - Twentieth Australasian Computer Science Conference
      ============================================================


                         5-7 February 1997
              Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia


ACSC'97 is the major Australasian computer science conference and 
is now in its twentieth year. The conference has a high reputation 
for the quality of the research presented, ranging from theory and
experiment to practice and application.

Submissions are now invited for ACSC'97. We welcome papers describing
original contributions in all fields of Computer Science research and
education. Each paper will be judged on its originality, significance,
correctness, and clarity. Its contribution should be clearly explained
in both general and technical terms, and authors should make every
effort to ensure that its technical content is understandable by a
broad audience. 

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, 
should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will 
attend the conference to present the work. Submitted papers 
should be no longer than 6,000 words. To be considered, four 
printed copies must reach the address below by the submission date,
which is a hard deadline.

       CATS'97 - Computing: The Australasian Theory Symposium
       ======================================================


                         3-4 February 1997
              Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia


CATS aims at bringing together computing theorists from the 
Australasian region. Papers are solicited on all aspects of the 
theory of computer science, including, but not limited
to: Category Theory, Complexity, Concurrency, Formal Semantics, 
Logic, Specification and Verification, and all aspects of the theory 
of Algorithms (including combinatorial algorithms, distributed 
algorithms, geometric algorithms, and parallel algorithms).

CATS'97 follows on from CATS'94 which was held in Sydney in December 
1994, and CATS'96 which was held in Melbourne in February 1996. It is 
hoped that the meeting will have an `active workshop' atmosphere, 
with ample time for discussions. Contributions describing work
in progress are welcome. 

Submissions should be sent in Postscript format to 
cats97@cs.rmit.edu.au by the submission deadline. For final 
submissions, LaTEX style files and MS Word style sheets will be 
provided via the URL http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/cats97. Authors unable 
to access or use these style files will be asked to prepare papers of 
at most ten pages in 10-point, two-column format.

Papers will be judged on originality, significance, correctness, and 
clarity. The contribution of the paper should be clearly explained in 
both general and technical terms, and authors should make every effort 
to ensure that the technical content of their papers is understandable 
by a broad audience. Submission of a paper should be regarded as an 
undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the 
authors will attend the conference to present the work.

                         3-4 February 1997
              Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia


ACAC is the principal annual Australasian conference on computer 
architecture. ACAC'97 follows on from previous computer architecture 
workshops held in Hobart, Brisbane and Adelaide, and its highly 
successful emergence as a fully refereed 2-day research conference in
Melbourne in 1996.

ACAC'97 will contain sessions for research group reports as well as 
for formal research papers. This forum will allow those involved in 
the field to see what new research is happening in the region and to 
encourage cooperative research and sharing of resources. ACAC'97 
invites the following two categories of papers:

Original research papers: Original papers in all areas of computer 
architecture research are invited. Papers describing implemented 
systems and novel applications are particularly welcomed. All papers 
will be refereed and accepted papers will be published in the 
conference proceedings. LaTEX style files will be made available on 
acceptance.

Australasian research group reports: Reports on Australasian computer 
architecture research projects are also invited. They should be in the 
same format and will be included in a section of the proceedings but 
will not go through the full rigorous reviewing process.

Papers should be submitted in uuencoded Postscript form to 
acac97@ee.newcastle.edu.au. If electronic submission is not possible, 
four paper copies should be sent to:

		Category Meetings at Vancouver
		      July 13-18, 1997
		
		   Preliminary Announcement

	As announced at the Sussex meetings Vancouver will host meetings
in Category Theory during July 1997.

	These meetings will be held at the University of British Columbia
campus in Vancouver, Canada.  The UBC Conference Centre has set aside
a block of rooms for this meeting including some double rooms and some
rooms for families as well as single rooms.  There are hotels available
off the campus as well.

	We are interested in having as many category theorists and 
students of category theory as possible attend these meetings in order to
provide the best chance for everyone to have a memorable  and valuable
mathematical experience.

	Details regarding this conference will be given in future
announcements.  In particular an accomodation form will be sent by email
early in 1997 as well as information concerning submission of abstracts by
those wishing to speak and registration information for those wishing to attend.

	CATEGORICAL LOGIC OF NAMES AND ABSTRACTION
	IN ACTION CALCULI 

Abstract.

Milner's action calculus implements abstraction in monoidal
categories, so that familiar lambda-calculi can be subsumed together
with the pi-calculus and the Petri nets. Variables are generalised to
*names*: only a restricted form of substitution is allowed.

In the present paper, the well-known categorical semantics of the
lambda-calculus is generalised to the action calculus. A suitable
functional completeness theorem for symmetric monoidal categories is
proved: we determine the conditions under which the abstraction is
definable. Algebraically, the distinction between the variables and
the names boils down to the distinction between the transcendental and
the algebraic elements. The former lead to polynomial extensions, like
e.g. the ring Z[x], the latter to algebraic extensions like
Z[\sqrt{2}] or Z[i].

Building upon the work of P.~Gardner, we introduce *action
categories*, and show that they are related to the static action
calculus exacly as cartesian closed categories are related to the
lambda-calculus. Natural examples of this structure arise from
allegories and cartesian bicategories. On the other hand, the free
algebras for any commutative Moggi monad form an action category. The
general correspondence of action calculi and Moggi monads will be
worked out in a sequel to this work.

This was done in Brian Day's thesis [D1]. It is accessible in [D2], [D3].
Starting with any monoidal category C with tensor product #, we obtain a
promonoidal category C with P(a,b,c) = C(a#b,c). Then the presheaf category
C^ becomes a (left and right) closed cocomplete monoidal category under the
convolution tensor product; the Yoneda embedding y : C --> C^ is strong
monoidal (preserves tensor). In fact, this is the universal monoidal
cocompletion (see [IK]). If C is symmetric, so is C^ and y preserves
the symmetry.

Subject: websites, ftp, and copyright 

Date: Fri, 19 Jul 1996 09:24:49 -0400
From: Phil Scott <phil@csi.UOttawa.CA>

Dear Colleagues:
   As many of you know, with the increasing use of web- and ftp-sites for
depositing papers, there is a problem about copyright and legal issues about
who owns the rights to your papers and if you can distribute electronic copies
(particularly after they have been published). I am thinking mainly of
Journals but certainly the same question exists for other types of published
material. This came to note recently at McGill when a statistician 
was ordered by Academic Press to remove something from his website, for 
copyright violation (see the web-site of Keith Worsley, 
http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~keith
(see his article 1995 by Worsley,Marrett, Neelin, Evans--when
you click on it the letter from AP will appear) ). Independently of this 
particular case, the issue is obviously of increasing importance, given
universal use of electronic sites at universities as well as shrinking 
library budgets.  There are many issues, from questions of how to keep in 
business traditional, high-quality journals (indeed, if they will--or should--
continue to exist in these days of web-publishing and electronic journals), 
to practical questions of what kind of publications will count towards tenure,
promotion, research grants, etc. Viewpoints of academics vary considerably, 
from those who wish to continue the stability of traditional journals to 
those who wish to have non-commercial electronic publishing. I suspect
economics will ultimately rule, but rational discussion with publishers
has begun. 

On a practical note,during  recent e-mail discussions with some colleagues
(M. Barr, P. Freyd, A. Meyer, M. Mislove, J. Mitchell, A. Nerode, A. Scedrov),
it was pointed out repeatedly that authors should keep their electronic 
rights, either by explicitly writing such on the copyright form mailed
to them by publishers, or use some kind of general form.  Andre Scedrov
and John Mitchell kindly supplied the Stanford form, which I enclose below.
I should also point out that many professional academic organizations
(American and Canadian Math. Soc, Association of Symbolic Logic, etc.)
and several commercial publishers do allow authors to keep electronic copies
of their articles on public e-mail sites. 

			Your comments much appreciated.

			Cheers,

			Philip Scott

I have been using the following form, which comes from Stanford, without
any problems with hardcopy journals. I have not tried it yet with electronic
journals.

Some hardcopy journals, like the Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, maintain freely
available electronic files of their published papers in their websites.

From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

In the second edition, the answer book was omitted (trying, not with a
great deal of success, to hold the price down).  We thought it was
going to be published separately, but instead the publisher was simply
sending a photocopy to all who requested it.  All who knew to request
it, in fact.  So with their permission, we have posted it.  On triples,
it will be in usual place (~ftp/pub/barr) as ctcs.ansbook.[dvi,ps].

PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS                               July 15, 1996

                     International Symposium on
         Theoretical Aspects of Computer Software (TACS'97)

                      September 24 - 26, 1997
                         Tohoku University
                           Sendai, Japan

The TACS Symposium will focus on the theoretical foundations of
programming and their applications. The topics of interest include:

  theoretical aspects of the design, semantics, analysis, and
  implementation of programming languages and systems; calculi and
  models of concurrency and parallel computation; categories and types
  in computer science; formalisms, methods, and systems for program
  specification, verification, synthesis, and optimization;
  constructive, linear, and modal logics in computer science; logics of
  programs.

The scientific program will consist of invited lectures, contributed
talks, demo sessions, and informal evening sessions. Proceedings
containing the full papers of the invited and contributed talks will
be published by Springer-Verlag as a volume of Lecture Notes in
Computer Science.

We have made the answers to the second edition of "Category
Theory for Computing Science" available on the web, in two ways.

1) As Mike Barr already announced, you can get them by anonymous FTP, at
triples.math.mcgill.ca in /pub/barr, files ctcs.ansbook.*. These are
available in TeX DVI and Postscript formats.

2) You can also get them by webserver, at
http://www.cwru.edu/CWRU/Dept/Artsci/math/wells/pub/papers.html#ansbook
These are available in DVI, Postscript and Acrobat Reader formats.
