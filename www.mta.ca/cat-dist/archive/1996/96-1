        The Algorithms and Languages Group
        ==================================

        University of Technology, Sydney
        http://linus.socs.uts.edu.au/~shape


                Two positions vacant
                --------------------

The Shape project is developing some exciting new ideas in the
semantics of data types so that they can be incorporated into
programming languages. The key concept is that data is stored
in shapes (or containers, or structures) which can be described and
manipulated separately from the data. Expected benefits are: 

      - that programs will be able to act on inputs of arbitrary shape
        (shape polymorphism); 
      - that shape errors (e.g. array bound errors) can be detected
        during compilation (shape analysis), and;
      - that (most) run-time operations will act on arrays.

The ALG currently has two staff and four graduate students, with
additional collaborators in Europe. 




Post-doctoral Research Fellowship
---------------------------------

This position is associated with an ARC large grant to use shape to
develop a parallel programming language suitable for numerical
analysis. The successful applicant will assist in the design and
implementation of the language. The position is full-time for two
years at a salary range of $43,042 - $44,657 p.a., to start as soon as
possible.

A doctorate in computer science (or its equivalent) is essential.  The
candidate must be able to make a significant contribution to the
project. The ideal candidate will have experience in implementing
languages on parallel computers, optimisation of programs for parallel
computers, functional programming, or type theory. The candidate must
have initiative, be able to work well as part of a team, and
communicate effectively.



Research Assistant (Level 5)
----------------------------

This position is associated with an ARC small grant to produce a
functional programming language that supports both shape polymorphism
and the core types of ML. The position is for a programmer to build an
interpreter for a prototype language, under supervision. Initially,
the position is full-time for six months, though extensions may be
possible. A part-time position over a longer period is also
possible. The salary range is $29,332 - $33,556 p.a.

A bachelor's degree in computer science or mathematics is
essential. The candidate must have good programming experience,
preferably with experience in functional programming. The candidate
must be able to work well without close supervision, interact well
with a team, and communicate effectively.



Applicants for both positions should address initial enquiries to
Barry Jay (cbj@socs.uts.edu.au). Copies of the selection criteria are
available on request.  Equal Employment Opportunity is University
Policy. Applications which should include the names addresses, phone,
fax and email of 3 referees should be sent to the undersigned by 5th
February, 1995, to:

From: Thomas Streicher <streicher@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>

I have the following question about factorisation of 
partial geometric morphisms (i.e. pullback preserving functors having right
adjoints).
It is well known that a pullback preserving functor F : A -> B between lex
categories factors as

         A ---> B/F1 ---> B   (where F_1 X = F(X->1) ) 
           F_1    Sigma_F1

where, of course, F_1 is lex. Moreover F_1 has right adjoint eta_1* o U_F1
provided F -| U.

Now my question is whether one can obtain something similar if A and B are
PARTIAL LEX, i.e. have pullbacks and binary products but not a terminal object.
In that case we can perform for every I in A the same factorisation as above

          A/I ---> B/FI ---> B   (where F_I(x:X->I) = F(x) )
              F_I    Sigma_FI

What I wonder is whether there exists a maximal factorisation of F as

         A -> C -> B
           F'   S

s.t. 

   F' preserves pullbacks and binary products and 
   S preserves pullbacks and has a right adjoint T 

and

   F' has a right adjoint if F has a right adjoint .


I have a tentative answer to that : namely take for C the pseudo-colimit of
B/F(-) : A -> Cat. 
Then everything works but the requirement that S has a right adjoint.

I'd be grateful for any pointers to literature, folklore results or ideas.

Hello,

Has the notion of Cauchy-completion of a bicategory been considered?
It looks to me that instead of looking at arbitrary idempotent 1-cells
f together with an isomorphism \alpha : ff ---> f one has to look at
those pairs <f,\alpha> where \alpha is associative.  Without this
requirement I seem to run into coherence problems.  

Any pointers to the literature would be welcome.  Thank you!

Has anyone proved that if you take an "algebra" (actually monoid) object
in a monoidal biclosed category that has equalizers and coequalizers,
then the category of two-sided modules for that algebra is again a
monoidal biclosed category.  Mac Lane did this in 1965 when everything
is symmetric (the tensor, the algebra and the modules) under the (surely
irrelevant) assumption that the original category is also abelian.  The
fact is certainly true, but writing down the proof would be rather
painful.

Hello,

Regarding Michael Barr's question: I have this result for bi-closed
bicategories, and actually talked about it in Halifax last year.
Als Micheal rightly suspects, some of the proofs get tedious, and
designing the relevant diagrams is something else, even using xy-pic!
I hope that the paper will be finished by March.

The question made me think - as perhaps it was meant to - of modules over
non-commutative rings, and I wondered whether its scope was unnecessarily
restricted in considering just 2-sided modules over a single algebra. We
also know that there can be a rich and well-behaved structure for bimodules
over two algebras:

   (A,B)-bimod tensor (B,C)-bimod is (A,C)-bimod
                 B

   (A,B)-bimod  hom (A,C)-bimod is (B,C)-bimod
               A

   (A,B)-bimod hom  (C,B)-bimod is (C,A)-bimod
                  B

Does anyone know how to state the question to cover this more general
context? But then what works for algebras ought also to work for
algebroids, i.e. enriched categories.

Actually, if the ground tensor is not symmetric, you cannot even
define the notion of (A,B) bimodule.  You can define that of left A,
right B bimodule and that seems to be that.  Perhaps that is what
Steve means when he says (A,B) bimodule.  In that case, he is, of
course, correct.  In fact, in writing this up, I find it less
confusing to do the more general situation exactly as described.
But I would rather not have to write it up if someone has already
done it as it is rather unpleasant.

                                (XI EBL'96)
                              May 6-10, 1996
                        Salvador (Bahia), Brazil


The XIth Brazilian Logic Conference/Encontro Brasileiro de Logica (XI EBL'96)
will be held in Salvador, Bahia (Brazil), from the 6th to the 10th May 1996,
sponsored by the Brazilian Logic Society (SBL). The conference will be
dedicated to the memory of Professor Mario  Tourasse Teixeira.

Since 1977 the Brazilian logic community has organized national
conferences under the aegis of SBL and in collaboration with the Centre
for Logic, Epistemology and the History of Sciences (CLE) of the State
University of Campinas (UNICAMP). The XI EBL will be held as a parallel
event with the 3rd WoLLIC'96 (3rd Workshop on Logic, Language, Information
and Computation) and the 6th SEMINFO (`6th Informatics Week'), which will
take place in the campus of the Federal University of Bahia.

Contributions are invited in the form of two-page (600 words) abstract in all
areas of logic, including set theory, model theory, non-classical logics,
algebraic logic, logic as related to computer science and philosophical logic.

Submissions:
Submissions, in the form of two-page abstracts (either paper copies or
electronic) must be received by MARCH 8th, 1996 by the Programme Chair or the
Secretary.  Authors will be notified of acceptance by April 6th, 1996.
Abstracts will be published in the Journal of the Interest Group in Pure and
Applied Logics (ISSN 0945-9103). Selected contributed papers will be invited
for submission to a special volume of the Proceedings of the conference to be
published by an international publishing house.

The location:
Salvador, Capital of the Bahia state, the first European settlement of
Portuguese America and the first Capital of Brazil, is where all the most
important colonial buildings were constructed: churches, convents, palaces,
forts and many other monuments.  Part of the city historical center has been
safekept by UNESCO since 1985. Five hundred years of blending Native American,
Portuguese, and African influences have left a rich culture to its people, which
can be felt on its music, food, and mysticism.  Salvador is located on the
northeastern coast of Brazil and the sun shines year round with the average
temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.  It is surrounded by palm trees and beaches
with warm water.  City population is around 2.5 million and life style is quite
relaxed.

In response to Michael Barr's question:

Theorem: If  V  is a closed braided monoidal category which is complete
and cocomplete then the bicategory  V-Mod  of V-categories, V-modules
(sometimes called V-bimodules, V-distributors or V-profunctors), and
V-module morphisms is a monoidal bicategory (meaning the hom of a
tricategory with one object).  However, in order for  V-Mod  to be
braided,  V  must be symmetric in which case  V-Mod  is also
symmetric (also called strongly involutory by Baez-Dolan).

If you are only interested in monoids in  V,  just take the subbicategory
of one-object V-categories. Of course, then, you can do with less
completeness and cocompleteness on  V.

But yes, the detailed proof of this makes a long, but fairly routine,
story. Brian Day and I are working on a paper "Monoidal bicategories
and Hopf algebroids" which will contain a discreet amount of detail
(along with other things). I have been talking about aspects of the
paper in our Category Seminars.

Ross

As previously announced on this mailing list, there will be a special 
issue of the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra to mark Peter Freyd's 
60th birthday. Formally, this issue is the proceedings of the
Peripatetic Seminar meeting held in Edinburgh last October, which was
also a celebration of Peter's birthday; but contributions are invited
from any of Peter's friends who were unable to get to the Edinburgh
meeting, as well. The closing date for submissions is 5 February 1996
(Peter's birthday).

Originally, John Power was to have been Guest Editor for this special
issue. Sadly, John has been unwell recently and has been advised to rest,
so he will not be able to undertake this work, and I have agreed to
take it over. The purpose of this message is therefore to ask people
who are planning to submit papers for the special issue to send them 
not to John but to me at DPMMS, 16 Mill Lane, Cambridge CB2 1SB, U.K.
If you have already sent off a paper to John, it will probably get
forwarded to me; but it's advisable to send another copy direct to me,
to be on the safe side. The deadline remains 5 February; it is
particularly important that this date should be adhered to, since I am 
due to leave for a 6-week visit to Australia shortly afterwards, and
any paper that fails to reach me in time to be sent off to a referee
before I go will not be considered.

Oriented Singular Homology
Michael Barr


We formulate three slightly different notions of oriented singular
chain complexes and show that all three are naturally homotopic to
ordinary singular chain complexes.

Functorial and algebraic properties of Browns P functor
Luis-Javier Hernandez-Paricio


In 1975 E. M. Brown constructed a functor $\cal P$ which carries 
the tower of fundamental groups of the end of a (nice) space to 
the Brown-Grossman fundamental group. In this work, we study this 
functor and its extensions and analogues defined for pro-sets, 
pro-pointed sets, pro-groups and pro-abelian groups. The new
versions of the $\cal P$ functor are provided with more algebraic 
structure. Examples given in the paper prove that in general the 
$\cal P$ functors  are not faithful, however, one of our main 
results establishes that the restrictions of the corresponding 
$\cal P$ functors to the full subcategories of towers are faithful. 
We also prove that the restrictions of the $\cal P$ functors to 
the corresponding full subcategories of finitely generated towers 
are also full. Consequently, in these cases, the towers of objects 
in the categories of sets, pointed sets, groups and abelian groups, 
can be replaced by adequate algebraic models ($M$-sets, $M$-pointed 
sets, near-modules and modules.) The article also contains the 
construction of left adjoints for the $\cal P$ functors.

On finite induced crossed modules and the homotopy 2-type of mapping cones,
Ronald Brown and Christopher D. Wensley

Results on the finiteness of induced crossed 
modules are proved both algebraically and topologically.  
Using the Van Kampen type theorem for the fundamental crossed module,
applications are given to the 2-types of mapping cones of 
classifying spaces of groups. Calculations of the cohomology 
classes of some finite crossed  modules are given, 
using crossed complex methods.

Kan extensions along promonoidal functors
Brian Day and Ross Street

Strong promonoidal functors are defined. Left Kan extension (also 
called "existential quantification") along a strong promonoidal 
functor is shown to be a strong monoidal functor. A construction for the 
free monoidal category on a promonoidal category is provided. A 
Fourier-like transform of presheaves is defined and shown to take 
convolution product to cartesian product.

Symmetric monoidal categories model all connective spectra 
R. W. Thomason

The classical infinite loopspace machines in fact
induce an equivalence of categories between a localization
of the category of symmetric monoidal categories and the
stable homotopy category of -1-connective spectra.

Distributive Adjoint Strings
R. Rosebrugh and R. J. Wood

For an adjoint string V -| W -| X -| Y : B --> C, with Y fully faithful,
it is frequently, but not always, the case that the composite
VY underlies an idempotent monad. When it does, we call the string
distributive. We also study shorter and longer `distributive' adjoint 
strings and how to generate them. These provide a new construction of 
the simplicial 2-category, Delta.

A forbidden-suborder characterization of binarily-composable 
diagrams in double categories, Robert Dawson

Tilings of rectangles with rectangles, and tileorders (the associated
double order structures) are useful as ``templates'' for composition in
double categories. In this context, it is particularly relevant to ask
which tilings may be joined together, two rectangles at a time, to form
one large rectangle. We characterize such tilings via forbidden suborders,
in a manner analogous to Kuratowski's characterization of planar graphs.

Categorical Data-Specifications

F. Piessens and E. Steegmans

We introduce MD-sketches, which are a particular kind of Finite Sum sketches.
Two interesting results about MD-sketches are proved. First, we show that,
given two MD-sketches, it is algorithmically decidable whether their 
model categories are equivalent. Next we show that data-specifications,
as used in database-design and software engineering, can be translated
to MD-sketches. As a corollary, we obtain that equivalence of 
data-specifications is decidable.

On the Size of Categories
Peter Freyd and Ross Street

The purpose is to give a simple proof that a category is equivalent 
to a small category if and only if both it and its presheaf category 
are locally small.

	    From Horn formula to Makkai sketch resolution

Abstract.  We provide a basis for logic programming into locally
finitely presentable (or l.f.p.) categories.  We thus begin to
consider higher order logic programming.  Horn formulas, in particular
systems of equations, generalize to finite Makkai (or M-) sketches.
Further, models of sets of Horn clauses generalize to, again called
models and forming the l.f.p. categories, M-sketches orthogonal to
sets of maps (axioms) between finite M-sketches.  Resolutions compute
maps (answers) from finite M-sketches (queries) to initial models.
Resolutions are cospans and lift to compositions of special
resolutions.

The following papers  are available as postcript files 
via R. Brown's home page
http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/home.html

R. Brown and W. Dreckmann,  
``Domains of data and domains of terms in AXIOM''. 
Abstract: This gives a general account and the source Axiom 2.0 code for 
directed graphs, free categories, free groupoids, which will give
an impression of coding in Axiom. 


R. Brown and O. Mucuk, 
``The monodromy groupoid of a Lie groupoid'',  
{\em Cah. Top. G\'eom. Diff. Cat}, 36 (1995) 345-369. 
Abstract:  We show that under general
circumstances, the disjoint union of the universal covers of the
stars of a Lie groupoid admits the structure of a Lie groupoid,
such that the projection has a monodromy property on the
extension of local smooth morphisms. This completes a detailed
account of results announced by J Pradines. 


R. Brown and O. Mucuk, 
``Foliations, locally Lie groupoids, and holonomy'',  
{\em Cah. Top. G\'eom. Diff. Cat}, (1996) (to appear).  
Abstract:  We show that a paracompact foliated manifold 
determines a locally Lie groupoid (or piece of a differentiable 
groupoid, in the sense of Pradines). This allows for the construction 
of holonomy and monodromy groupoids of a foliation to be seen as 
particular cases of constructions for locally Lie groupoids.

R. Brown, 
``Representation and computation for crossed modules'', 
Proceedings {\em Cat\'egories, Algebres, Esquisses, Neo-esquisses}, Caen, 
1994, 6pp.
Abstract: We argue for the need to develop `structural computation', to
handle the translation of algebraic structures between equivalent
categories. This is illustrated with the problem of the tensor product in
the equivalent categories of crossed modules over groupoids, double
groupoids with connection, 2-groupoids. 

R. Brown, M. Golasinski, T.Porter, and A.P.Tonks, 
``On function spaces of equivariant maps and the equivariant 
homotopy theory of crossed complexes.'' 18pp  

Abstract: This paper gives an equivariant version of the homotopy
theory of crossed complexes for the case of a discrete group action.  The
applications generalise work on equivariant Ellenberg-MacLane spaces,
including the non-abelian case of dimension 1, and on local systems.  It
also generalises the theory of equivariant 2-types, due to Moerdijk and
Svensson.  Further we give results not just on the homotopy classification
of maps, but also on the homotopy types of certain equivariant function
spaces. (Indag. Math. (to appear))


R. Brown and T. Porter, 
``On the Schreier theory of non-abelian extensions: generalisations 
and computations'', 21pp 
Abstract: Classically, a Schreier 2-cocycle for a group G involves
functions on the 3-fold and 2-fold products of G with itself. 
We show how a crossed resolution may be used to give smaller and
more computable presentations of such cocycles, which are determined by 
a presentation of G and identities among relations. This is a
modern expression of ideas of Turing, 1938. 

R. Brown and C.D.Wensley, 
``Computing crossed modules induced by an inclusion of a 
normal subgroup, with applications to homotopy 2-types'', 9pp 
Abstract: We suppose M, P are normal subgroups of a group Q and prove 
directly a value for the crossed Q-module induced from the 
crossed P-module M by the inclusion of P in Q. Using methods of free 
crossed resolutions, we calculate explicitly the k-invariant of 
this induced crossed module, in the case when Q/P is finite cyclic. 
We also use coproducts of crossed P-modules to obtain some general
results on induced crossed modules, again when P is normal in Q. 
These results are applied to the 2-type of  homotopy pushouts 
of certain maps of classifying spaces of discrete groups. 
This continues work of a previous paper, published in TAC, 1995, no.3. 

R. Brown and G. Janelidze, 
``Van Kampen theorems  for categories of covering morphisms in lextensive 
categories'', 9pp, (J. Pure Applied Algebra, to appear). 
Abstract: We show that lextensive categories are a natural setting for
statements and proofs of the ``tautologous'' Van Kampen theorem,
in terms of coverings of a space. 

R. Brown and G. Janelidze, 
``Galois theory of second order covering maps of simplicial sets'', 10pp, 
submitted, 1995. 
Abstract: We give a version for simplicial sets of a second order notion
of covering map, which bears the same relation to the usual coverings as
do groupoids to sets. The Generalised Galois theory of the second author
yields a classification of such coverings by the action of a certain kind
of double groupoid.

Title:    Interpretations of Yetter's notion of G-coloring: 
          simplicial fibre bundles and non-abelian cohomology
Authors:  T Porter
Date:  October 11, 1995
Abstract: This paper notes and explores the connection between
Yetter's notion of G-coloring where G is either a finite group or
a finite `Categorical group' and the theory of simplicial fibre
bundles.  This allows an interpretation of Yetter's topological
quantum field theory in terms of equivalence classes of simplicial
fibre bundles.  If G is a finite categorical group, these fibre
bundles have interesting lifting properties and their fibres are
groupoids.  Using recent results and descriptions of non-abelian
cohomology due to Breen and Duskin, these fibre bundles are linked
with non-abelian cocycles with coefficients in G.

From: Ross Street <street@mpce.mq.edu.au>

There has been some further discussion between Mike Barr and me
on modules between monoids in a complete, cocomplete, closed monoidal
category.

Mike responded:

>If I have understood your theorem, it is claimed only for the case that
>the original category is braided.  I was interested in the genuinely
>asymmetric case, so this doesn't apply.  Although your arguments
>are probably valid in that case, at a guess. Have I missed something?

So I said:

It looks as though **I** missed something. I didn't include the older
fact well known to enriched category theorists: even without any symmetry
or braiding,  V-Mod is a bicategory in which all right extensions and
right liftings exist (I don't like the word "biclosed"; I use "left closed",
"right closed" and "closed" for both when dealing with a monoidal category).
In particular, for any V-category  A, each hom category  V-Mod(A,A)  is a
closed monoidal category under composition (= tensor product) of modules
(as before, I don't say "bimodules" either). Even more particularly you
can take A to be a monoid in V.

For this there ARE references. I believe Benabou, in his Louvain-la-neuve
notes

"Les Distributeurs" Rapport No 33 jan 1973,

only looked at the case of V symmetric. Same is true of Bill Lawvere's
"Metric spaces" paper. But it is not hard to generalise. My paper

Enriched categories and cohomology, Quaestiones Math. 6 (1983)
265-283; MR85e:18007

does the non-symmetric case. But it does it more generally for  V
a bicategory (without commutativity you might as well have "several objects").
Other papers which build on this are:

Cauchy characterization of enriched categories, Rendiconti del Seminario
Matematico e Fisico di Milano  51 (1981) 217-233; MR85e:18006.

(with R. Betti, A. Carboni, and R. Walters) Variation through enrichment,
J. Pure Appl. Algebra 29 (1983) 109-127; MR85e:18005.

(with A. Carboni, S. Johnson and D. Verity) Modulated bicategories, J. Pure
Appl. Algebra 94 (1994) 229-282.

Gordon and Power have also done Gabriel-Ulmer duality for W-Mod where
W is a decent bicategory (homs locally presentable).  JPAA?

The recent thing with Brian Day looks at when  V-Mod itself is "monoidal",
a natural step beyond the above references & studied by Carboni, Walters
et al in the case where V is a poset (or W is locally a poset).

Best wishes,
Ross

                           TORONTO SPRING MEETING

         A Weekend Meeting on Category Theory and Its Applications

             YORK UNIVERSITY, North York (Metropolitan Toronto)

                    Saturday/Sunday, April 13/14, 1996

                             Second Announcement


Principal Speakers:

                 Andre JOYAL, Universite de Quebec a Montreal

                 Robert PARE, Dalhousie University, Halifax

                 Cristina PEDICCHIO, Universita di Trieste



Registration:  There is a registration form attached to this message.
If you intend to attend the meeting, please fill it out as soon as possible and
return it to
	                  yorkcat@mathstat.yorku.ca

There will be a registration fee, payable upon arrival, of $25 per employed
participant ($12 for others) to cover expenses for refreshments and a common
lunch on Saturday.

Contributed talks:  There will be morning and afternoon sessions for
contributed talks on April 13 (starting at 9 a.m.) and a morning session on
April 14 (ending by 2 p.m.). Talks will be a maximum of 30 minutes each. Anyone
who is interested in speaking at the meeting should indicate this on the
registration form. If there are more potential speakers than time slots, the
organizers will endeavour to follow the policy of first-come-first-served.

Location of meeting:  The meeting will take place on the main campus of York
University, 4700 Keele St, North York, which is in the northwestern area of
Metropolitan Toronto. Highway 401 is the best major highway for accessing the
campus by car. There is an exit for Keele St off 401; York University is
approximately 4-5 miles north of 401, north of Finch Avenue. There are traffic
lights and a large sign at the main entrance of the University, which is on the
left-hand (west) side of Keele. Specificc directions about reaching the
university from various accommodations are given below.  Detailed information
concerning the venue of the conference will be given in the Third Announcement.
Maps will be installed on the WWW (see below); hardcopies can be mailed to
participants upon request.

Travel:  Having a car in Toronto would be an advantage and would maximize
enjoyment of the weekend. However, public transportation is good, and we shall
suggest a number of hotels from which the Univeristy is easily accessed.
Pearson International Airport is not far from the University. Taxi fare to the
University or environs is approximately $25-30. Taxi fare to downtown hotels is
approximately $30-40. There is also a bus connection with the downtown hotels
and with the Yorkdale Shopping Centre, which also has a subway stop; for
further information, see below. Participants from Montreal can also book
flights which arrive at the downtown Island Airport. Union Station, the train
terminal, is located downtown across from the Royal York Hotel and not far from
the other downtown hotels. The bus terminal is also  located conveniently
downtown.

Accommodations:  We have reserved a small contingent of guest rooms in the
student dormitories ($25 per night) which will be given with preference to
graduate students. In general we recommend that participants reserve rooms in
one of the North York or downtown hotels listed below. All hotels with the
exception of the Holiday Inn Express (details below) should be called directly.
Your choice of accommodation should be guided by cost and additional planned
activities during your stay. Hotels near the campus will shorten transportation
time to the meeting, but they are generally not in scenic areas. We point out
that for those who can extend their stay or arrive early on Friday, Toronto
offers a wide selection of museums, live theatre, and musical or sporting
events, as well as excellent shopping and restaurants. To take full advantage
of these activities, a downtown hotel or hotel near the subway line is
recommended.

Saturday night: In view of the length of the meeting and the scope of
activities in Toronto, we have decided to forego a saturday evening party. We
will have information on recommended restaurants at the meeting and will
circulate some information on cultural events with the Third Announcement.

Welcome reception on Friday night:  Participants are invited to an informal
welcome party on friday night with wine and cheese in Walter Tholen's home
beginning from 8 p.m. Directions will be given in the Third Announcement.

Information on the web:  Up-dated information on the TSM can be obtained on
Walter Tholen's home page on the World Wide Web:
htpp://www.math.yorku.ca/Who/Faculty/Tholen/menu.html

Please see below for information on hotels, public transport, airport buses,
and for the registration form. The Third Announcement will be circulated before
April 1. We hope to see you in Toronto in April!

********************************************************************************

Hotel list:  This list is divided in two groups, North York and Downtown. The
hotels in North York will allow for a shorter commuting distance to the
university than the downtown hotels. They are comfortable and reasonably
priced. However, with the exception of Novotel, they are located in industrial
or commercial areas of the city and, hence, do not offer attractive scenery.
The downtown hotels provide a generally attractive city ambience, but they may
pose a Sunday morning transportation problem for participants without cars,
since the subway does not run before 9 a.m. on Sunday. Thus, those who stay
downtown must be prepared to take a taxi or a sequence of buses that morning.
