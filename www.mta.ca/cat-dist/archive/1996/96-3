The location:
Salvador, Capital of the Bahia state, the first European settlement of
Portuguese America and the first Capital of Brazil, is where all the most
important colonial buildings were constructed: churches, convents, palaces,
forts and many other monuments.  Part of the city historical center has been
safekept by UNESCO since 1985. Five hundred years of blending Native American,
Portuguese, and African influences have left a rich culture to its people, whichcan be felt on its music, food, and mysticism.  Salvador is located on the
northeastern coast of Brazil and the sun shines year round with the average
temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.  It is surrounded by palm trees and beaches
with warm water.  City population is around 2.5 million and life style is quite
relaxed.

                  TITLE AND ABSTRACT OF INVITED TALKS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some Semantical Aspects of Linear Logic
Andreas Blass

I plan to discuss some of the semantics that have been proposed for Girard's
linear logic, including different forms of game semantics, de Paiva's
Dialectica-like semantics, and perhaps others.  I shall describe how these
semantics are related to each other, to the intuitions that underlie linear
logic, and to some other parts of mathematics.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trees, Ordinals, and Termination
Nachum Dershowitz

Trees are a natural representation for countable ordinals.  We describe natural
well-founded orderings of finite binary trees, finite ordered (plane-planted)
trees, rational binary trees (finite or infinite binary trees with only finitely
many different subtrees), and "supertrees" (trees whose nodes may themselves be
supertrees). We relate these orderings to existing ordinal notations, and
illustrate their use in various colorful termination problems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proof Theory and Semantics for Structurally Free Logics
J. Michael Dunn

This work is joint with R. K. Meyer. The idea is to provide a semantics and
proof theory for combinatory logic, extended by a "residual" (implication). The
semantics is a variation on the ternary relational (Meyer-Routley) semantics for
relevance logic, as extended by Meyer-Routley, and more recently others for the
(fusion-implication) fragment of the relevance logic B+ (closely related to the
non-associative Lambek calculus). The proof-theory extends some semi-published
work of Meyer in the 1970's (following a suggestion of Belnap), wherein
Gentzen's structural rules for the intuitionistic implication calculus were
replacewith explicit introduction of a combinator licensing the combinatorial
manipulations.  This is extended so as to make combinators "first-class
objects," and a cut theorem can still be proven.

This is called "structurally free logic" in analogy with "logic freed of
existential presppositions." In this original "free logic," existence
presuppositions are made explicit, just as in "combinatorially free logic"
combinatorial moves are made explicit by adding the combinators that license
them as explicit premisses in the antecedent of the sequent. This allows various
logics to be translated into the combinatorially free logic. It also expands the
meaning of "substructural logics" beyond the usual ones obtained by considering
various subsets of Gentzen's structural rules (plus say associativity). There
will also be results about adding other connectives (conjunction and
disjunction), with or without distribution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three Levels of Knowledge Representation
Peter G"ardenfors

Within logic, AI and early cognitive science, almost all research concerning
knowledge representation has been based on symbolic (propositional) models.
In the 80's connectionist models became popular as an alternative way of
modelling knowledge.  I propose that also a third type of knowledge
representation based on conceptual models should be studied.  In particular,
I will discuss conceptual models based on geometrical and topological notions
and show their relevance for concept revision and for non-monotonic aspects of
concepts.  I will argue that conceptual models of knowledge can be seen as a
bridge between symbolic and connectionist representations.  The three kinds of
knowledge representation models should thus not be seen as competitors, but
rather as complementary models suitable for different modelling tasks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Semantics Meets Discourse
Jeroen Groenendijk

In update semantics the meaning of a sentence is identified with its potential
to change the information state of an agent. In the recursive semantic
definition, truth conditions are replaced by update effects.  Central notions
are not truth and validity, but consistency, support, and coherence.

Although update semantics is advertized as addressing itself to the
interpretation of discourse, rather than being limited to single sentences,
it usually goes no further than interpreting sequences of utterances of a single
agent. In the present talk I will study the interpretation of multi-agent
discourse. The object language we investigate is the language of modal predicate
logic. We concentrate on the role of (epistemic) modalities in discourse, and on
anaphoric relations (binding of variables) across utterances of different
speakers. The aim is to characterize notions of logical consistency and
coherence of multi-agent discourse.

The paper reports on joint work with Martin Stokhof and Frank Veltman.

Sequential Algebras
Roger Maddux

The sequential calculus of von Karger and Hoare ("Sequential Calculus",
Inform. Process. Lett. 53(1995), 123-130) is designed for reasoning about
sequential phenomena, dynamic or temporal logic, concurrent or reactive systems,
and so on.  Unlike the classical calculus of relations, it has no operation for
forming the converse of a relation.  Sequential algebras are defined by
von Karger so that sequential calculus turns out to be the equational theory of
the class of sequential algebras.  A standard example of a sequential algebra is
the powerset of a partial ordering (a transitive reflexive relation) with
Boolean operations (union, etc.), composition, and two operations that are
conjugate to composition. Nonstandard examples arise by relativizing
nonrepresentable relation algebras to elements that are transitive and
reflexive.  The incompleteness and non-finite-axiomatizability of the sequential
calculus will be presented through some new constructions of sequential algebras
and relation algebras.  These algebras improve on previous examples in certain
interesting respects and give yet another proof that the classical calculus of
relations is not finitely axiomatizable.
This is joint work with Peter Jipsen (Cape Town).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Logical" Relations between Syntax and Semantics
Andrew Pitts

In this talk I will discuss some recent developments in the mathematical
foundations of programming language semantics. On the one hand, Freyd's
categorical analysis of recursively defined domains has led to simplified
techniques for denotational semantics involving such domains.  On the other
hand, work of Abramsky, Howe and others on co-inductively defined "applicative
bisimulations" has provided quite powerful theories of equivalence of functional
programs, defined in terms of their operational semantics. I will tie together
some of these developments by describing a certain "logical relation" between
the syntax and semantics of lambda calculus which can be used to derive
extensionality and continuity properties of operationally-defined program
equivalences from corresponding properties of recursively defined domains.  The
logical relation itself goes back to Plotkin.  What is new is the recognition
that the relation has a certain property (a "universal property", in
category-theoretic terms) which both characterises it uniquely and permits the
operationally-based properties to be derived.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verifying Timed and Hybrid Systems
Amir Pnueli

The talk presents new computational models for real-time and hybrid systems.
For timed systems we propose a model called A Clocked Transition System (CTSS).
The CTSS model is a development of our previous Timed Transition model, where
some of the changes are inspired by the model of Timed Automata.  The new models
lead to a simpler style of temporal specification and verification, requiring
no extension of the temporal language.  We present verification rules for
proving safety properties (including time-bounded response properties) of
clocked transition systems, and separate rules for proving (time-unbounded)
response properties.  To justify the need for time-unbounded resopnse rules, we
present a characteristic example of a timed system which terminates but no
apriori bound on its termination time can be given All rules are associated with
verification diagrams.  The verification of RESPONSE properties requires
adjustments of the proof rules developed for untimed systems, reflecting the
fact that progress in the real time systems is ensured by the progress of time
and not by fairness.

The style of the verification rules is very close to the verification style of
untimed systems which allows the (re)use of verification methods and tools,
developed for untimed reactive systems, for proving properties of real-time
systems.

We conclude with the presentation of a branching-time based approach for
verifying that an arbitrary given CTSS is Non-Zeno.

This is joint work with Y. Kesten and Z. Manna.

From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

 
 Let me introduce my response by saying that although I was more-or-less
 familiar with Lawvere's thoughts on the subject, I had never thought too
 much about them until some years ago, more than 5, less than 10, when
 I found myself teaching a course in set theory.  For the first time,
 I came to realize what a complex horror set membership really is.
 In every other type of mathematics I had ever studied, the objects
 were some kind of sets with some kind of structure and the arrows were
 the functions (or at worst equivalence classes of such) that preserved
 them.  Mostly, the structure was given by operations, or at least
 partial operations, although Top was something of an exception, but
 even there, continuous maps are those that preserve ultrafilter
 convergence.
 
 But of course, Sets are an exception.  Here are sets defined in terms of
 these elaborate epsilon trees and this structure is invariably ignored.
 It seemed to me intuitively, confirmed by Makkai, that the ONLY arrows
 between sets that actually preserved all that structure were inclusions
 of subsets.  So that obvious category is just a poset.  But of course
 the truth is that that epsilon structure is invariably ignored.  So
 why is it taken as the basis of mathematics.  Much better to simply
 define sets as the objects of a category and then an element is just
 a global section, or rather an equivalence class thereof.  
 
 My whole experience with category theory convinces me that membership and
 the closely related idea of equality is an intrinsically obscure notion
 Or rather, not that it itself is obscure, but it obscures anything
 it touches.  Like, the idea of embedding Z into Q by taking the eqivalence
 classes of fractions and then removing those that include a fraction
 of the form n/1 and replacing them by the corresponding integer.  Yes,
 it can be done and we certainly want to say that Z is a subring of Q,
 but it is such a mess and so unnecessary.
 
 Some would say, but not I, that you should just work in your favorite
 topos.  I take a platonic view that there really are sets, but membership
 and equality are not the simple concepts we think they are.  In particular,
 I would like to say that a fraction is a pair of integers m/n, n > 0 and
 that m/n = p/q when mq = np.
 
 I don't know about pointers to the literature. 
 
 Cheers, Mike

  On Mike Barr's comments. The bulk of them are right enough, though maybe it
is not quite fair to complain that something designed as foundation for every-
thing is awkward to work with. Like complaining that the tax code is full of
qualifications and exceptions. But, what stirred me to respond is recognition
of an old friend in
<<I would like to say that a fraction is a pair of integers m/n, n > 0 and
<<that m/n = p/q when mq = np.>>
   So would Saunders MacLane, sorry, Mac Lane. He gives the axioms in his 1948
invited address published as 'Duality for groups' in BullAMS 1950. The
community has not taken up Saunders' axioms, can't think why.

Michael Barr's reply to this question was not entirely complete (IMHO), as
he forgot to mention that he wrote a short paper some time (3 yrs) ago
dealing with matters related to this.  Those interested might want to
download his paper, which can be obtained by ftp from triples.math.mcgill.ca
in the directory pub/barr (look for variable.sets.*.Z, where * = dvi, tex,

I thought these were Weber's axioms.  Lerhbuch der Algebra, 1895.

The integers are likewise pairs m-n of natural numbers, with m-n = p-q
when m+q = n+p.

Natives of Ab are no doubt comfortable defining the integers as the
tensor unit.  But in Ab, ZZ = Z.  Are people from Ab even aware that
there are infinitely many integers?  Can they even count?

People from Set surely know a whole lot more about Ab than people from
Ab know about Set.

(By Ab I mean the closed category of Abelian groups, with all logic
conducted internally, i.e. Hom:Ab\op x Ab -> Ab.)

One may argue that formal set theory relates to topos theory in the
way that untyped lambda calculus relates to the typed theory. If you
think it's difficult to get a model of set theory out of a topos try
to get a model of untyped lambda calculus out of a model for the typed
theory.

The semantics of core mathematics -- unlike the semantics of a
programming language -- has never presented much of a problem. The
perversity of formal set theory as a foundational language for
mathematics has not been much in evidence for the simple reason that
no mathematician has ever actually used it for his semantics. 

I am not saying here that the continuum hypothesis is perverse, or
even questions about much larger cardinals. (For one thing they can be
stated easily in a topos setting.) I am saying that formal set theory
allows entirely perverse questions that have nothing to do with the
semantics of mathematics.

The actual elements used for a mathematical construction are never of
interest. Imagine your reaction to an interruption at the beginning of
a lecture on number theory, "Which construction of the natural numbers
do you have in mind? Russell's or Van Neumann's?" My favorite example
of the sort of perverse question one can ask if one were to take
formal set theory seriously is "Does any simple group appear as a zero
of the Riemann Zeta function?"

Hi,

It's perfectly feasible to imagine that in say, descriptive set theory,
properties of certain structures could be shown by showing (1) they have a
certain cardinality, (2) sets of such cardinality have epsilon trees with a
certain property and (3) using epsilon induction over such epsilon trees to
prove something about our original structures.  [I don't know of any such
instances; I'm not a descriptive set theorist.]

Alternatively, what about Godel's constructible universe.  This seems to be
a mathematical construction, and the actual element relation seems to be
not only of interest, but essential to the construction.

This is an interesting example.  You state a question in mathematical
English, and then criticise ZF for being able to express this question,
while category theory cannot.  One wonders what other questions stated in
mathematical English---some of them perhaps perfectly sensible---can be
stated in the language of ZF, but not in the language of category theory.
I'd much rather that my formalisation of mathematics could state
nonsensical things (consistency strength isn't an issue here), than to be
living in the fear that my formalisation may be inadequate to express some
sensible arguments.

Two examples that I think are relevant to this debate.

Category theorists are keen on statements to the effect that structures are
defined by their universal properties.  A typical book on topos theory may
define an elementary topos as a category with finite limits and power
objects.  It then goes on to show that any topos has internal-homs.  How?
By defining the function space as a certain set of sets of ordered pairs...

Let Nat(x) be the statement "x is a triple (omega,S,0) to which the Peano
axioms apply". ZF |- "there exists x such that Nat(x)".  This is sufficient
to do arithmetic; after proving this single existential statement, one need
never give a particular construction of the natural numbers again.  Indeed,
if one is really worried about these things, note that ZF+"Nat(omega)"
(where omega is a new constant symbol) is conservative over ZF and then
work in the latter theory, without ever fixing on a particular
interpretation of ZF+"Nat(omega)" into ZF.

Both category theory and set theory are amenable to working with
mathematical structures by either explicit constructions or by uniquely
characterising properites.  In both category theory and set theory, we
prove the existence of structures with certain uniquely characterising
properties via explicit construction.

Ralph.

My point exactly.  The elements don't matter, so why should

of mathematics?  Equality doesn't matter either, but

Nonsense.  How can a set of sets of ordered pairs be an object of a
topos.  In fact, there is at least one book that defines a topos as
a category with finite limits and power objects and constructs the
internal homs as a limit of two arrows between two power objects.
The construction is hidden inside a cotriple, but that is what it
amounts to.

i at least am curious just what is this mathematical question you
claim to have in mind which zf can express but which category theory
can not.  obviously it wasn't "Does any simple group appear as a zero

mathematical question at all.  zf was being criticized for being
unable to not express this non-question, and category theory was being
praised for having the option to express "it" (should someone actually

whatever was the real point that you were trying to argue might still

	The semantics of core mathematics -- unlike the semantics of a
	programming language -- has never presented much of a problem.

It would be interesting to hear a few mathematicians who *don't* work
much in foundations comment on this.

===

Item A.

	The perversity of formal set theory as a foundational language
	for mathematics has not been much in evidence for the simple
	reason that no mathematician has ever actually used it for his
	semantics.

Isn't this a bit strong?  An awful lot of mathematicians are under the
impression that their definitions are grounded in set theory.  This has
the enormous advantage for them that, if pressed as to whether their
own mathematics is consistent, they can claim

(a) that the definitions could be expanded all the way out to whatever
fragment of ZF they're assuming if the auditors insist, and

(b) that if their local framework is inconsistent, then the part of ZF
they used (and a fortiori the whole of ZF) is itself inconsistent.  "If
I go down, I'm taking you with me" sort of thing, just like if we ever
find a polytime recognizer for an NP-complete set.

Being well-calibrated on the structure of ZF and which bits are at
greater risk makes it a *lot* easier to organize one's mathematics to
minimize the risk of consistency.  Pretending there never was any risk
of inconsistency in the first place is *very* well contradicted by the
historical record, particularly in calculus.

Today we have trustworthy infinitesimals, of a very elegant kind,
thanks to nonstandard arithmetic.  While one might *wish* that these
had been discovered by categorical means, the actuality is that their
discovery used very heavy doses of formal set theory.  Whether we can
do it today with less heavy doses is beside the historical point.
Formal set theory evolved in response to consistency concerns, and
today it engenders for many of us a strong sense of safety, implicit in
our trust of our own tools, and explicit in actual products such as
infinitesimals we can trust.

===
Item B.

	My favorite example
	of the sort of perverse question one can ask if one were to take
	formal set theory seriously is "Does any simple group appear as a zero
	of the Riemann Zeta function?"

Item A argues that many of us *do* take formal set theory seriously.
In this item I will argue that doing so does not force one into this
sort of situation.

Now there's nothing inconsistent about going inside a definition and
asking implementation-specific questions.  People do this all the time,
in fact one might argue that mathematicians do it every one or two
sentences.

In any such visit to the inside of a definition, people seem to treat
the occasion as though a tacit NDA (nondisclosure agreement) applied.
Perhaps it shouldn't be so tacit.

MATH NDA.  When you step inside a definition, you agree to bring in
only permitted imports.  You agree furthermore that when you leave, you
will take out only permitted exports.

The usual definitions of "simple group" and "zero of the Riemann Zeta
function" permit neither importing nor exporting the other concept.
Your example enters both definitions at the one time, imports the other
concept in each case, and exits each definition with illicit
information, racking up a total of four NDA violations in a single
exchange.

Even if mathematicians don't stick this NDA to their doors, they know
instinctively to use it, independently of whether their math is
implemented with sets or categories.  Violations of the NDA will get
you funny looks.

===
A+B

Now here's a *very* important point, it's why I separated the above two
issues out as two items.

Item B, the NDA protocol, does not conflict with Item A, the reliance
on the consistency of ZF that many put their trust in.

There is no more conflict here than there is between NDA's in business
and the laws of physics.  All an NDA does is *restrict* what things can
be done, it does not break or even bend any law.

If you don't stick to the NDA's, you may get funny looks, but
consistency is not put at risk.  If you add an unexplored axiom to ZFC
you put consistency at serious risk *and* you get funny looks.  All
very analogous to violating business NDA's and breaking laws of
physics.

===

Back to my original question.

CAT is grounded in Set when you take the homfunctor to go to Set, as is
standardly done.  But the very notion of set is defined by membership;
a set is determined by the truth values of membership of candidate
elements of it.

A choice to be made early on is whether the candidate elements of a
given set themselves must form a set, the point of view encouraged by
toposes where the very question of membership is a private business
discussed only in power objects (a power breakfast comes to mind).  The
alternative is to allow the candidates to form a proper class, as in
ZF, which will blithely tell *every* individual except 1 and 2 that
they are not members of {1,2}, without any consideration of their
feelings.

The first choice does seem saner to me.  However a lot of people think
globally about membership and equality, and it seems like a lot of
religious mumbo-jumbo to them not to be allowed to even *ask* whether
two things are not equal when they don't live in the same
neighborhood.

So when I write about sets, can I safely adopt a "Boolean" style and
say that the question "x \in {1,2,3}" (equivalently, "x=1 or x=2 or
x=3") has only two answers, yes or no?  Or should I do the mumbo-jumbo
thing and clarify the ground-rules by explaining how the existence of
neighborhoods creates at least one more possible answer?  Or should I
pretend there's no problem and think mumbo-jumbo even when I know my
audience is thinking Boolean?

I *hate* that third alternative, it seems so dishonest.  But maybe
dishonesty is the best policy in this situation...

There are all sorts of near-by examples but they're not
counterexamples to my assertion. The fact that any structure of a
certain type is isomorphic to one with further special properties is a
standard first-step. The most usual further property is the existence
of a well-ordering.  But there's no such example, nor will there ever
be, in which one must use some property of the elements of every
possible structure of the given type in order to prove a property of
the structure. That's a tautology if the "property of the structure" in
question is an isomorphism-invariant.

  Alternatively, what about Godel's constructible universe.  This
  seems to be a mathematical construction, and the actual element
  relation seems to be not only of interest, but essential to the
  construction.

I must agree that when making constructions in mathematical subjects
in which the elements are the essence then one will use elements.

About my example of the philosopher who asked the number theorist (I
actually witnessed this) whether he was proving theorems about Russell's
or Van Neumann's numbers led Ralph to reply:

  for being able to express this question, while category theory

In fact there are topos-theoretic analogues for Russell and Van
Neumann, but not even a philosopher would be tempted to ask the
analogue question. Besides the R and VN numbers one could ask the
analogue question about the Lawvere and the Church numbers (in
category theory, not in set theory). But one wouldn't.

Anyway, I do have a counterexample to my own assertion. I think JH
Conway gave us some examples of mathematical constructions in which
the elements are the essence, to wit, his games and his numbers. Conway
games can be described as the result of replacing the single epsilon
of ZF with a pair of epsilons (for left and right "moves"). If one
restricts attention to "impartial" games (any move legal for one player
would have been legal for the other) then the two epsilons can be 
conflated and the subject conflates to ZF.

Peter Freyd's old question "Does any simple group appear as a zero

it contains what philosophers would call a "category mistake".
Pleasing because it's precisely the sort of mistake you can't make
if you're working in a category.

My original problem was what to do about the absolutely ghastly
argument I complained about, showing that membership could be figured
out in Set.  I now have a solution, only a couple of whose 70 lines are
needed to describe membership.  The rest explicitly, arithmetically,
and (except for infinite products) completely describes all the
adjunctions of (a lightweight version of) the bicomplete topos Set.

For starters, you need to accept Mike Barr's intuition that "the
elements don't matter."  If it bothers you that {2,4,17} is not "in" my
version of Set, you aren't looking at it from Mike's perspective.

It's tempting to make Set even lighter weight than I do here by
constructing it as Skel(Set).  But while this is technically feasible,
it makes the definition of limits and colimits on infinite sets
obscure, and also loses a property I'll mention below in connection
with a nice observation of John Isbell.

Instead I retrace what I imagine is a familiar path for set theorists,
but from the categorical perspective.  I take the objects to be simply
the ordinals, each defined as the set of ordinals less than it, and the
maps to be all functions (in the usual sense) between ordinals.  (So
for all cardinals alpha, this Set has only alpha many sets of
cardinality less than alpha, which is what I mean by lightweight.)

This may well have been already proposed before, since it is so simple
and solves my problem so directly.  But if so then why didn't someone
bring it up as an answer to my question?

The ordinals being a transitive class, membership i \in j coincides
with (global) strict inclusion i \subset j, which as will be seen below
is definable as the left "local" inclusion of i into i+(j-i).  This is
ten times shorter than the method I complained about (Goldblatt 12.4)
for calculating membership in Set!

Here are some features of this version of Set.  I'll abbreviate \omega
to \w, \eta to \i, \epsilon to \e.

* The full subcategory consisting of the finite sets is skeletal.

* Since every set is well-ordered, by definition, Choice holds.

* Since i+j=k is uniquely solvable in j for i<=k (this can be seen
informally by deleting the first i elements of k and taking j to be the
order type of the residue), it follows that monus (nonnegative minus)
can be defined, denoted k-i.  (Note that i+j=k is not uniquely solvable
in i, witness i+\w=\w which has all finite ordinals as solutions while
i+\w=\w+1 has no solutions.)  We also have ordinal ("integer") division
i/j and remainder i%j, see below.

* The *global* inclusion (assumed proper) of i into j is definable,
namely as the "local" inclusion of i into i+(j-i) (meaning the first
half of the unit of the adjunction defining +, at (i,j-i)), just when
this is not the identity on i.  (For j <= i, j-i = 0, making the local
inclusion the identity.)  The global inclusions make Set an irreflexive
poset, identical to membership except that we do not normally speak of
membership of x in y as a map, only as the truth of the binary relation
of membership at the object pair (x,y).  If for some crazy reason we
want to represent the membership relation by maps in Set, the global
inclusion maps are the obvious choice.

* The isomorphism 1=>x = x is the identity 1_x, and similarly for the
isos \rho: x*1 = x, \lambda: 1*x = x, and \alpha: (x*y)*z = x*(y*z)
making Set a strict cartesian closed category.  I wrote = rather than
tilde to avoid a repeat of yesterday's screwup with caret, but in fact
these are equalities in the strongest sense: they make \rho, \lambda,
and \alpha all identity natural transformations.

Isbell's argument in CTWM VII.1 shows that we can't *always* make
\lambda,\rho,\alpha identities, even in a CCC like Skel(Set).  In the
present context Isbell's argument yields more, namely that any
construction we use to further reduce Set from the ordinals to a
skeletal category *must* weaken these identities to isos.

What saves the day for ordinals is that when x,y,z are countably
infinite, x*y and (x*y)*z get to be different infinite ordinals.
Isbell's argument gives really nice insight into why set theorists find
ordinals work better than cardinals: as cardinals, countable x*y and
(x*y)*z have to be the *same* countable cardinal, ordinals create
useful elbow room.  (Without this category perspective, I don't know how
to make a convincing case for ordinal arithmetic over cardinal, anyone
know a noncategorical way?)

* The inclusion of the rationals into the reals (as Dedekind cuts) is
definable, but only as a local inclusion, not a global one, nor a
monotone one with respect to the well-ordering of the reals.  Set well
orders the reals "randomly," and we get to probe around in the
resulting well-ordering after the "big coin toss" and sniff out some
(all?) aspects of its crazy choices.  (Use the global inclusion of 1
into the reals to locate the "least" real "0", which can now be
compared with the "real" additive identity of the reals, 0.0.)  But
because it depends on the coin toss it is not mathematics, just
unrepeatable noise.

*  But this isn't to say that every uncountable ordinal looks random.
The least uncountable ordinal \w_1 *is* ordered predictably and
repeatably, and that order *is* genuinely mathematical (to believers in
\w_1 anyway).

There's presumably a lot more to say about Set defined this way, but
this is way overlength already, so let me push on to describe the
category Set itself.  The description talks about 0 and successor early
on; these can be understood either externally starting from an already
constructed Set (less demanding pedagogically) or internally as a
purely categorical definition of Set (in terms of constants 0,1,+
denoting initial and final objects and a coproduct), which will
inevitably seem circular just like ZF seems circular.

====================Light Set---V.R. Pratt--3/13/96===========

I'll start from the class of von Neumann ordinals, each the set of all
ordinals less than it (sorry, Mike), and define all small sums and
products, (co)equalizers, and the classified subobjects.  I'll follow
the standard ordinal conventions for binary sum and product, which make
1+\w = \w < \w+1 and 2*\w = \w < \w*2.

We need some auxiliary operations on ordinals.

        i/j  =  the least k satisfying i < j*(k+1)
        i%j  =  i - j*(i/j)     (i modulo j)

Exercises.  i <= j*(i/j), i%j < j.

Binary sums (for illustration).  To form i+j, form j' by adding i to
the *elements* of j (recursively), and take i+j to be i union j', with
the evident inclusions.  (This is not commutative in general, as noted
earlier.)

This generalizes to all small sums as follows.  Given a family n_i of
ordinals indexed by i<I (I=2 for binary sums), take their sum to be the
least ordinal s such that there exists a family f_i of monotone
injections f_i:n_i->s such that i<j<I, h<n_i, k<n_j -> f_i(h)<f_j(k).
For the rest of the adjunction defining this sum, take the unit
\i_<n_i> to be <f_i> and the counit \e_k to be \n.n%k (*not* \n.n%I).

Binary products (for illustration).  Form i*j as the sum of j copies of
i, with the evident projections.  (Not commutative in general.)

Infinite products are a well-known problem for ordinal arithmetic,
starting with \w copies of 2.  The problem is to well-order the
continuum.  Choice says only that a well-ordering exists, we can't
determine one by the constructive methods that work on everything else
in this note.  We just do our best.

Given a family n_i of ordinals indexed by i<I, take their product to be
the least ordinal p such that there exists a jointly monic family f_i
of monotone surjections f_i:p->n_i (the projections) such that for all
x<y<p, if there exists a largest j such that f_j(x) != f_j(y), then
f_j(x) < f_j(y).  The projections form the counit while the unit is the
linear function \n.an where a=1+sum(n_i,i+1<I) (the brick's diagonal).

The incompleteness of this specification arises when such a largest j
does not exist.  Note that care is taken not to contradict the
definition for finite products, which *does* completely specify the
adjunction for product.

Exponential ij.  Defined as the product of j copies of i (inheriting
the infinite product problem when j is infinite).  The unit of the
defining adjunction (-j right adjoint to j*-, not -*j) has for its
morphisms linear (!) functions an+b where a = sum((ji)k,0<=k<j), b =
sum(ki(ji)k,0<=k<j).  The counit (evaluation map) at i is the function
\n.((n/j)/i(n%j))%i.  This works by (i) projecting out the function
part of n as n/j and the argument part as n%j (ii) evaluating by
"shifting" and "masking" to pick out "digit" n%j in radix i.  Theorem:
this function is the evaluation map.  (So this weird-looking function
is not an "implementation hack" at all, it's the unique function for
the job.)

Subobject classifier:   Given f:i->2, the associated subobject is the
least j such that there exists a monotone injection g:j->i such that
fg = 1!.  Theorem: such a g:j->i exists and is unique, and is the
pullback of 1:1->2 along f.

The equalizer of f:i->j and g:i->j is the subobject of i corresponding
to the predicate on i "f(x)=g(x)".  Theorem: this exists and is
unique.

The coequalizer object k of f:i->j and g:i->j is the subobject of j
whose characteristic function p:j->2 is the predicate "is the least
representative in its block".  The coequalizer h:j->k maps each element
of j to the least representative of its block.  Theorem: h exists and
is unique.

I for one _do_ live in fear (not really ... more a sort of smug
schadenfreude) that set theoretic formalisation is inadequate to express
some sensible arguments.

The nonsensical things in set theory seem to arise from a basic nonsensical
postulate: that there is a single fundamental relation "element of" on the
mathematical universe that is sufficient to determine the nature of every
mathematical object. It's a tour de force of modern mathematics that so
much has been accomplished using this postulate, but its essential
unreasonableness should not be forgotten and it is therefore complacent to
assume that it is adequate to express all sensible arguments.

Let me give some examples.

1) The "element of" relation is absolutely _un_fundamental - this is part
of the force of Freyd's example about simple groups. What are the elements
of a real number? If you consider the real number to be a Dedekind section,
then it is a pair of subsets of the rationals, Q, and hence its elements
are whatever you think the elements of an ordered pair are. Or,
equivalently, it can be represented as a subset of Qx2 (or Q x any
doubleton {L,R}). Or, equivalently, a subset of QxQ, with (q,r) in x iff
|q-x| < r (i.e. the real is identified with its neighbourhood filter of
rational open balls). All these enable a real to be described as a set, but
they give it completely different elements. In reality there is no single
universal "element of" relation that describes the nature of everything,
including the reals; instead, the reals are described by various relations
with other specific objects.

2) Topology: Normally one thinks of open sets as being sets of points, but
localic topology views points as being sets of opens (e.g. reals as
neighbourhood filters above). There is obviously a fundamental relation of
points being "in" opens, and localic arguments can be expressed quite
reasonably using it. Set theoretic expression using "element of" completely
obscures this. In other words, set theory prevents you from adequately
expressing reasonable arguments.

3) Generic objects: Suppose we agree on a particular set theoretic
representation, e.g. reals as Dedekind sections. What then is a _generic_
real, such as the x in f(x) = x^2? Set theory has to treat this as a mere
hole where a specific real could be put, but it is quite reasonable to
treat it as a real in its own right (so long as you don't use - e.g. -
excluded middle to demand specific properties of it) and that's exactly
what people do. What are its elements? One can still make sense of the idea
that it is determined by its elements (using "generalized elements" and
Kripke-Joyal semantics), but in doing so one must go far beyond classical
set theory.

4) What about theories such as that of accessible categories, that, for set
theoretic reasons, have to be liberally sprinkled with infinite cardinals?
Doesn't this make you think that perhaps set theory is somehow obscuring
simple ideas?

To my mind, the evidence suggests that despite its undoubted successes, set
theory is not right for mathematical foundations, and we should be looking
for its replacement. It is easy to be bemused by the fact that all our
mathematical upbringing presumes set theoretical foundations, but we should
try to recognize its limitations and failures.

Really?  Try telling that to people who produce computer verified
correctness proofs for communication protocols.  I'm sure they'll be
pleased to know that their proofs should undergo a very significant
increase in size and obscurity to satisfy what appears to be little more
than aesthetic prejudice.

Equality matters in some contexts, it doesn't matter in others.  In some
logics equality is definable rather than explicit, in which case this point
doesn't appear to make much sense.  Trying to be perscriptive about
this---or any other---foundational point seems to me about as useful as
(and just as perverse as) perscriptive linguistics.

Given the known relationships between e.g. topos theory, higher order
logics and various set-theories, is arguing about which is the correct /
best / most relevant foundations of mathematics really that different from
arguing about whether the Russell naturals or the von Neumann naturals are
the correct / best / most relevant natural numbers?  [Of course, this is
fairly independant from questions such as how to present the natural
numbers]

<sigh/smirk> My desire for a little irony got the better of my pedantic
instincts.  I'm well aware that the phrase "representative of a subobject
of the power-object of a product" would have be more precise than the
morally equivalent set-theoretic terminology.  It doesn't effect the point
that I was trying to make; that whether one defines certain things by
explicit construction or via an axiomatisation is fairly independent of
whether one prefers to work in a logical, categorical or set-theoretic
foundation.  Neither is this effected by the availability of alternative
constructions.

Of course, for some people, it would be a perfectly sensible point of view
that topos theory is interesting precisely because of results to the effect
that a couple of elementary constructs are sufficient to justify the fairly
general use of set-theoretic notation, such as refering to a `set of sets
of ordered pairs'.

This might be a little disingenuous - 

Of course, in any topos there will be a monic X=>Y --> P(XxY) , so via the
"internal language" X=>Y may be seen as a certain set of sets of ordered
pairs.  But the point is that via the "internal language" you can (and
indeed you may) argue about the structure of a topos in a very "set-like"
manner.  But of course you are not obliged to do so.  So in a very real
sense, your (first) example illustrates that your fear is unfounded.
(Indeed, one can imagine a topos theorist pondering the matter of simple
groups being zeros of the Riemann zeta function in suitable toposes; the
point of Peter Freyd's observation was (I think) that a topos theorist
without any taste is less likely to stumble upon this question than a set
theorist without taste, who might well do so... due to the emphasis upon
different fundamental notions in the two approaches.)

	Several contributors to this thread share Loader's confusion on a 
couple of points.

	For one, constructibility in set theory does have an isomorphism
invariant meaning, as Mitchell showed in JPAA about 1975. Trivial changes
make the definition work in any topos with natural number object. In fact,
a good bit of work in set theory today is on finding isomorphism invariant
consequences of V=L or related axioms (constructibility relative to some
set). Elementhood is not essential.

	And Peter Freyd's question 

	"Does any simple group appear as a zero of the Riemann Zeta
		function?" 

is not absolute nonsense in ZF or in category theory--it is only 
misleading as it makes a question of (arbitrarily definable) codings look 
like a question of complex analysis. 

	In ZF the answer is: It depends which coding of groups and numbers
you use--it is easy to make up codings where the answer is yes and just as
easy to make them up where the answer is no.

	For what it is worth, the codings in common use all make the
answer "no", since they make every group an ordered 3 or 4 tuple while
they make a complex number an ordered pair of infinite sets. This is
trivia. 

	Now suppose we found some good relation representing groups as
complex numbers, which was manageable to work with and for which we could
show that some simple groups correspond to points which would falsify the
Riemann hypothesis. 

	Then mathematicians might well start asking whether some zero of
the zeta function "is" a simple group--just as we now ask whether some
given real number "is" rational (a question whose strict answer on most ZF
codings is always "no"). And this question would be just as well expressed
in category theory as in ZF.

Below I consider a notion of orthogonality with respect to cones, 
generalising that of orthogonality with respect to maps and the sheaf 
condition for a cover in a Grothendieck topology:

  1. We say that an object  K  is orthogonal to a cone  D --> C  
     whenever for every cone  D --> K  there exists a unique  
     C --> K  such that  (D --> C --> K) = (D --> K).

  2. For a category  K  and a class  J  of cones in  K  we define 
     O(K,J)  as the full subcategory of  K  consisting of all those 
     objects orthogonal to every cone in  J.

My question is:

  Let  A  be a small category and write  Psh A  for the topos of 
  presheaves on A. 

  Is there a characterisation of the classes  J  of cones in  A  for 
  which  O(Psh A,J)  is a topos?

Comments and pointers to relevant literature are welcome.  Many thanks,
Marcelo.

This question clearly is mathematical English, in the sense that it is in
the English language, and uses mathematical jargon.

It doesn't make sense.  I wasn't arguing with that.  Ruling out statements
from being "mathematical" *merely* on the grounds that they offend your
mathematical taste, quickly becomes disasterous.  Especially when we're
(implicitly) talking about a formalisation in a formal language such as
that of first order set theory.

Anyway, as a good example, take a set-theoretic proof of Borel
determinancy.  Can anyone give a reasonable category theoretic proof of
Borel determinacy?  [This is a result that Friedman showed is a theorem of
ZF but not of Z, if my memory serves me correctly.]  This could well
suffice to answer my concerns w.r.t. the adequacy of category language, by
showing how even arguments needing replacement can have category theoretic
analogues.

Ralph.

P.S.  My personal opinion on foundations is fairly agnostic, in case anyone
mistakes my concerns with rejection of category theoretic foundations.

We seem to have got completely sidetracked from either of the points I was
trying to make (probably my fault for making it unclear that it was a two
points, and for using sloppy language).

The (good) category theorist proves

"there exists internal homs [in any topos]" [by constructing particualar
internal homs, or otherwise].

The (good) set theorist proves

"there is a structure satisfying the Peano axioms [is a theorem of first
order ZF]" [by constucting one explicitly, or otherwise].

Both can then be asked "which is the real internal hom / set of natural
numbers".  Both can answer that they didn't claim that there is a
particular "real" internal hom / set of natural numbers.  [See my P.S.]

A (bad) topos theorist might never actually prove "there exists internal
homs", but rather continually refer to an explicit construction, rather
than its universal properties.

A (bad) set theorist may construct a set, and never prove that it satisfies
the Peano axioms, but rather keep referring to the explicit construction.

In both cases, the bad mathematician has a real problem when asked why
they're using their particular construction, as opposed to some isomorphic
alternative.

In both cases the good mathematician does the right thing---showing the
existence of structures with appropriate properties, and then using those
properties, rather than refering to any particular structure.

This was with regards to the question "Which construction of the natural
numbers do you have in mind? Russell's or Van Neumann's?".  Now we have a
slightly different issue:

>point of Peter Freyd's observation was (I think) that a topos theorist
>without any taste is less likely to stumble upon this question than a set
>theorist without taste, who might well do so... due to the emphasis upon
>different fundamental notions in the two approaches.)

I read Peter Freyd's original criticism to be a criticism of the fact that
it was *possible* to ask [Quote: `one can ask'] "Does any simple group
appear as a zero of the Riemann Zeta function" in ZF, presumably claiming
that this cannot be asked in category theory.

If we weaken this to just saying that category theory makes some
nonsensical statements more clearly nonsensical than they would be in set
theory, then I have no objections to his statement.

"Makes ... more clearly" is a matter of aesthetics, which is sometimes an
important consideration.  However, are aesthetics an overriding
considerations for foundations?  It's not obvious to me that it's even a
_foundationally_ important consideration here---as has been pointed out by
others, people don't do real mathematics in either first order topos theory
or in first order ZF; it is probably impossible to develop a reasonably
clear mathematical vernacular in either.

Ralph.

P.S.  In any case, it is entirely possible to carry out formalisation of
mathematics in first order ZF in such a way that statements like "A simple
group appears as a zero of the Riemann Zeta function" do not have a
formalisation.  This is an application of the good practice I advocated
above.  In brief outline (=incomplete):

Let Reals(R,+,*,0,1,<) be "R,+,*,0,1,< is a complete Archimedean linearly
ordered field"(2), stated in the language of 1st order ZF in the obvious
way.  Define formalisations of sentences about the reals so as to be
formulae in the form(1)

Reals(R,+,*,0,1,<) implies phi(R,+,*,0,1,<)

along with a _proof_ of a ``type-checking'' sentence

( there exists (R,+,*,0,1,<) such that Reals(R,+,*,0,1,<) and
phi(R,+,*,0,1,<) ) if and only if ( for all (R,+,*,0,1,<), if
Reals(R,+,*,0,1,<) then phi(R,+,*,0,1,<) )

Now of course, if a sentence about the reals can be seen to make sense,
then there should be a straightforward proof that it is independant of any
particular presentation of the reals, so that the type-checking statement
will be ZF-provable.  Clearly, if phi tries to formalise Freyd's statement,
then it's type-checking sentence is false and not provable.

Note that if phi is a tautology (or a contradiction) then it will have a
provable type-checking sentence.  We could probably argue until the cows
come home about whether or not this is reasonable.

(1) Using a trivial (&conservative) extension of ZF would enable us to drop
the "Reals(R,+,*,0,1,<) implies".  This is probably necessary if we wish to
formalise statements with free variables over the reals [I use sentence in
the logical sense of not having free variables].

(2) Apologies if I missed an axiom of the real numbers.

P.P.S.  This is getting off-topic for a category theory list.  If people
want to carry this on, perhaps we should take this off the categories list.

Without looking, I'm certain that they include calculus.  I'm not sure
what is meant by "calculus doesn't need a semantics."  My impression
was that the evolution of analysis was a beautiful interplay of
definition and theorem that went on for centuries, from Newton (if not
even earlier) right into the end of this century!

Do you see a clear distinction between "definition" and "semantics"?

	1) The "element of" relation is absolutely _un_fundamental -
	this is part of the force of Freyd's example about simple
	groups. What are the elements of a real number?

Yes, when you need to kick a set theorist, the real number line is a
particularly sensitive part.  Excellent kick.  Ouch.

	In reality there is no single
	universal "element of" relation that describes the nature of
	everything, including the reals; instead, the reals are
	described by various relations with other specific objects.

I'm with you 100% philosophically on this.  We move and rest, and need
vocabulary for both activities.  Sets are great for lolling around in
(I wonder how Cantor was at sports in school), but terrible for zipping
perfectly smoothly along the real line.

Categories give a much smoother ride than sets because they're *built*
to.  But they also have stationary parts, that show up in two places.

(i)    The objects.  This is where one rests between morphisms.  Having
your objects form a set is a Good Thing, it fits their punctual style:
"Be there on the dot" says the set.

(ii)   Homsets.  Sets are dual to their elements.  This seems to be
because when dealing with powersets you have a higher probability of
meeting the contravariant power set functor herself than one of her
covariant brothers.  (Not a theorem, just a feeling.)  Homsets are no
exception.  When you pass from moving along one morphism at a time in a
category to contemplating the morphisms lying there in profusion in the
homsets, you dualize your viewpoint and see a morphism as merely a
punctual dot of a homset.  This explains the paradox of the very
unpunctual morphisms able to make themselves the punctual members of a
homset, we just view them dually "from the other direction" (not one
parallel to the morphisms though).

I agree that it is a type error to try to understand a smooth line as
made of points when it is just trying to do its job and get you from
point A to point B uninterrupted (poor gap, I interrupted it).
Interruptions are incompatible with smooth travel.  But travel with no
rest at all is pretty grim and hard to sustain when you're trying to
get some real work done, whence line *segments* rather than entire
lines for category theory.  Hell is having to move forever along the
real line!

But it is equally a type error to try to turn your rest stops into
motion.  You *need* to rest from time to time.  For one thing it gives
your maintenance department a turn at doing stuff, maintenance has to
shut down when you're on the move, on-the-fly maintenance is *much*
harder.  And if you're the type of person that has opponents, it's all
in the game to give them a turn.

But if I'm with you 100% philosophically on this example, I'm only with
you about 50% mathematically.  It seems to me that set theory supports
the go part of stop-and-go traffic *pretty* well.  Not perfectly, as we
agree.  But when you consider how much of the continuum set theory *is*
able to comprehend, I'm not terribly sold on the inadequacy of sets for
modeling go almost as well as stop.

	2) Topology: Normally one thinks of open sets as being sets of
	points, but localic topology views points as being sets of
	opens (e.g. reals as neighbourhood filters above). There is
	obviously a fundamental relation of points being "in" opens,
	and localic arguments can be expressed quite reasonably using
	it. Set theoretic expression using "element of" completely
	obscures this. In other words, set theory prevents you from
	adequately expressing reasonable arguments.

I'm with you <10% on this one.  I can't tell what limitation of Set
you're talking about here, but unlike your philosophically excellent 1)
it doesn't seem to match up to any of the well-known limitations.

It sounds like you're saying that set theory doesn't let you talk about
the converse of the membership relation.  That's certainly not the
case.  Or maybe you mean that Set\op is not a concrete category.
What's wrong with its concrete representation as CABA?  If that seems
too complicated, how about its coconcrete representation as the
category of sets and their *converse* functions (binary relations whose
converse is a function)?

Maybe you're saying that  Hom:Set\op*Set -> Set  is outside set
theory.  That too is implausible.

None of these issues hold the sort of terrors for set theorists that
the continuum does.  At least not a terror that has them terribly
bothered mathematically the way the continuum problem does.

	3) Generic objects:

0%, needle wrapped around the post.  You seem to be saying that set
theorists are scratching their heads over what a variable is while the
category theorists have it all sorted out.  News to set theorists.  You
can't kick a set theorist in the variables, they're very well protected
there.

	4) What about theories such as that of accessible categories,
	that, for set theoretic reasons, have to be liberally sprinkled
	with infinite cardinals?  Doesn't this make you think that
	perhaps set theory is somehow obscuring simple ideas?

I don't know how to define "accessible category" without bringing
cardinals into the picture, but maybe I'm the last one to find out how,
as usual.  What's the trick?

	To my mind, the evidence suggests that despite its undoubted
	successes, set theory is not right for mathematical
	foundations, and we should be looking for its replacement.

Whoa, needle went negative there.  But I would have the same reaction to
a set theorist who claimed that categories were nothing but an
alternative language for the mathematics ordinarily and satisfactorily
treated by set theory.

("Alternative language for" is the polite code word some people use for
"weird way of talking about")

Set theory itself will only go away when the natural numbers go away.
Let's get real here.  The natural numbers are the very oxygen of
mathematics, and they are not going away in *any* foreseeable future.
Hence neither is the (internally) bicomplete topos of finite sets.
This topos is a very nice concrete way of working with natural
numbers---it makes numbers *more* categorical, not less, by letting you
transform them.

But sets *do* have to transform via arbitrary functions, there's no way
to wriggle out of *that* one!  Transforming sets with binary relations
neuters them, neutered sets are only good for the side lines.
*Converse* functions on the other hand are fine, if you're not Bill
Thurston, who eloquently expressed his inability to relate to Set\op at
UACT.

I don't care how the infinite sets are organized, just so long as
there's a way of doing it that doesn't make the logic that bears on my
life inconsistent.  I'm not planning on rubbing up against any infinite
sets personally without a sturdy layer of math and logic between me and
them.  You can seriously injure yourself with an infinite set.

Mathematics founded on set theory stays close to the air supply.  Any
religious upstart of a foundations claiming to offer a viable
*replacement* for set theory is going to have to argue real hard about
the disadvantages of breathing!

Whether we should work with sets and categories in exactly equal
proportions is an interesting question.  I tend to be slightly more
settish than cattish in my thinking, if only because I'm lazy and sit
around a lot, on the dime if not on the dot.  But there's not a big
gap.

Categories: can't live with sets, can't live without them.
Sets: can't live with categories, can't live without them.

Vaughan Pratt

PS.  No reactions yet to my ordinal-based definition of Set.  Main
thing I want to know is, is it old hat?  Second thing, is it good for
anything else besides what I made it up for, namely to shorten the
passage from function composition in Set to the membership relation on
ob(Set)?

I don't claim any more *significance* to the membership relation in my
version of Set than Mike Barr et al were claiming for other versions of
Set.  Well, maybe a little more: it is undeniably the membership
relation for ordinals, which is all my Set claims to contain
*explicitly*.  But is pi essentially an ordinal?  Of course not.  Can
pi exist in my Set?  No more or less than in anyone else's Set.  Is pi
made any more real by installing it in a category?  Rubbish.

There's certainly a clear distinction between "definition" and 
"semantics". They are -- to echo PeterJ -- in different categories.

But Vaughan's point about the calculus is well taken. I must back down
a bit. Yes, a semantics for the real numbers and for limits and for
continuity and -- hardest these days to believe -- for the very notion
of function were indeed needed by 19th C mathematicians.  So let me
try again. Core mathematics in the 20th C did not provide a problem
for semantics and for that reason the inadequacy of formal set theory
was not noticed. 

Inadequate for what? Well, let's start with the Church polymorphic
notion of number.

The recent discussion of sets against categories on the internet appears to
miss the appropriate sources.

It is well known that it is easy to go from sets to categories, harder in
the reverse.  For this there is a very well-known equicoherence theorem,
which is presented in both the standard texts on topos
        Johnstone, Chapter 9, S 7
        Mac Lane / Moerdijk (Sheaves in Geometry and Logic, Chapter 6, S 10.)

I fondly imagine that the latter is a bit clearer.  Both sources will give
your the original literature--for example Mitchell JPAA 2(1972) p. 261 (I
suggested this question to Bill Mitchell when he was an instructor at
Chicago).

As far as I can make out; none of the many messages speaks to this fact. 
It is a reasonable question for Pratt to raise, though he should have known
that the Goldblatt book was hopeless from day one.

Of course most mathematicians find sets easier than cats--but they usually
can't recite ZFC axioms.  The fault may lie with Pat Suppes, who taught
sets in the Kindergarten.

Otherwise, the exchange convinces me tht e-mail is for the birds.  All
fluff with no professional substance

these years.

Now I know just how he must have felt.  What a relief to find I have
*not* been a semanticist all these years.

All I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by.  Definitions tell
us our position relative to both our destination and the rocks of
inconsistency.

Whatever semantics is, if the navigator says he can't do his job
without it we're lost.  Another round of semantics for the navigator.

	let's start with the Church polymorphic notion of number.

Of course when the navigator's had so much semantics he tells you he's
seeing double, you do worry a bit.  That semantics is heady stuff.

Reference *much* appreciated, which I am browsing now.  (Peter, will
Topos Theory be back in print soon?)

	It is well known that it is easy to go from sets to categories,
	harder in the reverse.

This is disturbing, since it is the opposite of the answer I came up
with myself a couple of days after asking my question.  (I am reading
"harder" as "necessarily harder" here, my apologies if this was not
your intended meaning.)

As often in these things, at least some of the problem lies with my
question, which was certainly fluffy when I asked it, not knowing then
quite what I really wanted to ask.  I think I can sharpen it now.

Is there a category equivalent to Set for which it is easy to recover
the membership relation from the category structure?

This is still not a mathematical question as it leaves "easy" open to
interpretation.  But I think the rest of it is unambiguous.

Now I thought I'd answered this sharper question in the affirmative,
with an interpretation of "easy" that surely *no* reasonable person
could complain about, namely a two line construction of the membership
relation.

Therefore if my answer was only "fluff", I have made an error
somewhere, either in my construction of this version of Set or in my
choice of problem.

With regard to the latter possibility, I freely admit to knowing less
than just about anyone on this list what it feels like to work in a
general topos, not enough to write even 6 pages about them let alone
600.  My experience of toposes is with one topos only, Set, which makes
me about the last person qualified to attempt a contribution to topos
theory.

However, that my question only concerns the one topos Set gives me hope
that, if there is indeed a problem with my construction, it is some
technical oversight that I need to repair if possible, and not
something to do with other toposes besides Set.

In passing, let me again draw people's attention to the fact that I
described not just the category Set but its (cartesian) closed
structure as well, including complete verification of the coherence
conditions.  (Not that this was particularly difficult in this case. :)

Without giving the full closed structure I do not understand how one
can claim to have fully specified which topos one is speaking of.  Does
the topos literature attend adequately to this detail?  (It may well, I
just don't know where to find it.)

I interpret the reference to Isbell at the end of VII.1 of CTWM as
(inter alia) a warning that one cannot take the closed structure for
granted merely because it is cartesian closed.  If this misinterprets
the situation for the cartesian closed case, and coherence is in fact
routine there, then my apologies for the misunderstanding.

                         CATEGORIES DATABASE/TOOLS

A C program for storage of and computation with finitely presented
categories is now available as described below. 

The program is menu-based and stores finitely presented categories,
functors between them and finite-set valued functors from them.  The
storage format is the same as that used by the Carmody-Walters `kan'
program (available from the University of Sydney ftp site.)

Several tools for computation with finite categories are included. For
example, tests for equality of arrows, whether an object is initial and 
so on. A new implementation of the Todd-Coxeter procedure for computing 
left Kan extensions is complemented by an implementation of a procedure 
for computing right Kan extensions. Details are included in the user 
manual which may be found at 
ftp://sun1.mta.ca/pub/papers/rosebrugh/catuser.dvi

The program was written by Michael Fleming and Ryan Gunther while they 
were employed at Mount Allison University under NSERC Canada's USRA 
program. It is free software and without warranty. Indeed, it should be 
treated as an `alpha' version. Bug reports (to rrosebrugh@mta.ca) 
are welcome, but may not be acted upon immediately.

The source code and compiled (Sun and DOS) versions are 
avalable for ftp from the directory
ftp://sun1.mta.ca/pub/sources/rosebrugh/{unix,DOS}
The compiled versions are named category.exe. A set of examples is 
found in the `examples' subdirectories.

The following repairs two problems I found with my ordinal-based
axiomatization of Set: missing axiom of infinity (no NNO), and an
inconsistent definition of product.


1.  Add "There exists x such that 1+x=x."  (Set *forbids* FinSet.)

(By equality in my axiomatization I always mean identity, not just
iso.)


[A reminder that i/j = min k[i < j*(k+1)], and  i%j = i - j*(i/j)
(ordinal division and ordinal remainder, used in the following).
Exercises.  (i) j*(i/j) <= i.  (ii)  i%j < j. ]


2.  Replace the definition of product by the following.


Given an ordinal i, the i-product p = p_i of a family <n_j>,j<i of
ordinals is defined up to Choice by recursion on i to be the least
ordinal p_i satisfying the following.

The 0-product p_0 is 1.

For all j<i, the j-product p_j of the family <n_m>,m<i is defined by
recursion along with, for all k<=j, an *auxiliary* projection
f_{jk} : p_j -> p_k, namely \n.n%p_k.  (So f_{jj} is the identity.)

For successor ordinals i = k+1, the definition of p_i is completed by
requiring that it have in addition a *main* projection
g_k : p_{k+1} -> n_k, namely \n.n/p_k (a monotone function).

For limit ordinals, the definition of p_i is completed, up to Choice,
by requiring it to be *a* categorical limit of the diagram whose
objects are, for j<i, the j-products p_j of <n_m>, m<j, and whose maps
are the recursively defined auxiliary projections between those
objects.  The projections of this limit to the recursively defined
j-products p_j are the auxiliary projections f_{ij} : p_i -> p_j
defined at this level.

The counit of i-product at family <n_j>, j<i, has for its j-th map,
j<i, the composite g_j f_{i,j+1} : p_i -> p_{j+1} -> n_j.  These are
the *standard* projections of ordinal product.

The unit of I-product at n (the diagonal d_n: n->n^I) is the K
combinator, \m.(m,m,m,...), sending m to the constant I-tuple of m's.

-----

I-Products act just like counters with I digits; this is lexicographic
product adapted to infinite ordinals.

Compare the explicit definition \n.n%p_k, a monotone function, at
successor products to the underdetermined categorical definition at
limit products.  The latter defines ordinal product only "up to
Choice," bringing in Choice as a "randomizer".

That a limit of this (small) diagram exists is immediate by the
completeness of Set.  Once one such limit has been found in this
version of Set, all ordinals of the same cardinality become equally
eligible, and the first paragraph of the definition then selects the
least ordinal from among these.  By definition this is a cardinal, and
so our definition makes *all* limit products cardinals, a nice
feature.  But even though we know exactly which cardinal, the product
is only defined up to an automorphism.  The well-ordering of that
cardinal is thus completely uncorrelated with the projections.

Barring further bugs, this definition is an underdetermined alternative
to those of Birkhoff 1942 and Hausdorff, who gave fully specified
notions of ordinal or lexicographic product.  Birkhoff's definition did
not always produce ordinals, though it did preserve linearity.
Hausdorff's definition did not even send ordinals to linear orders.
The above preserves ordinals, inevitably at the cost of nondeterminism
at each limit ordinal.

Vaughan Pratt

PS.  I learned after giving the obvious (for Set) ordinal version of
the axiom of infinity above, that Peter Freyd had shown it was
equivalent to NNO not just for Set but for *any* topos.  Now *that's*
what I call an interesting property of toposes.  A lightweight
collection of such nice facts in one place might put hard-to-please
types like me in a more receptive frame of mind for the massive body of
theory that topos theory seems dependent on.  Halmos fits "all" the
basic material about naive set theory in his 100-page book.  Is it fair
to say that the corresponding material treated in topos theory requires
considerably more space?  And if not, when can we expect the topos
counterpart to Halmos?

After seeing the volume of "fluff" that this topic had generated on
Friday, I took a vow not to contribute any more to it. But Vaughan
Pratt seems to be challenging the rest of us to find something wrong
with his ordinal-based definition of Set, and no-one else has taken
up the challenge; so I'll have to break my vow and point out its
obvious shortcoming.

Vaughan's definition is fine as long as you are happy, not just to
assume that the axiom of choice holds, but actually to rely on it
to construct codings for you. If AC doesn't hold, the Vaughan's
category fails to be cartesian closed; and even if it does, you
don't have the ability to point to a particular object of it and
say "This is the set of real numbers" (still less to point to a
particular morphism and say "This is the addition operation on
real numbers"); you have to rely on God's (or "the randomizer's",
as Vaughan seems to call him) ability to do it for you.

I suppose only a minority of mathematicians are unhappy about AC
to the extent of actually rejecting any construction that can't be
done without it. But I think a very large majority would be unhappy
about calling upon God to construct things for them (such as the
real numbers) for which they know there is a perfectly good 
man-made construction. Such people are going to be in a near-
permanent state of unhappiness if they are condemned to do
mathematics inside Vaughan's category.

By the way, the Cole--Mitchell--Osius equivalence between weak Zermelo
set theory and well-pointed topos theory, which is described in my
book (sorry Vaughan, but Academic Press won't reprint it) and in
Mac Lane--Moerdijk, doesn't assume the axiom of choice; it's an
"optional extra" which you can add to both sides of the equation
if you want to.

	Younger participants and lurkers in this past week's discussion
may be shocked at the large amount of frantic concern to prevent obscurity
from becoming extinct.  Vaughan Pratt's question: -- should one forget
altogether about membership -- `and' -- just work in one's favorite
topos? -- still remained unanswered.

	The possibility of rejecting the rigid epsilon chains as a
`foundation' for mathematics occurred to many around 1960.  But for me the
necessity for doing so became clear at a 1963 debate between Montague and
Scott.  Each had tried hard to find the right combination of tricks which
would permit a correct definition of the fundamental concept of a model of
a higher-order theory (such as topological algebra). Each found in turn
that his proposal was refuted by the other's counter example (involving of
course unforeseen ambiguities between the given theory and global epsilon
in the recipient set theory). 

	The whole difficulty Montague and Scott were having seemed in
utter contrast with what I had learned about the use of mathematical
English and what we try to make clear to students:  in a given
mathematical discussion there is no structure nor theorem except those
which follow from what we explicitly give at the outset.  Only in this way
can we accurately express our _knowledge of_ real situations.  A foundation
for mathematics should allow a general definition of model for
higher-order theories which would permit that crucial feature of
mathematical English to flourish, confusing matters as little as possible
with its own contaminants.  We are constantly passing from one
mathematical discussion to another, introducing or discharging given
structures and assumptions, and that too needs to be made flexibly
explicit by a foundation. Of course the reasons for this motion are not
whim, but the sober needs of further investigating the relations between
space and quantity,etc and disseminating the results of such
investigation. 

	The idealization of a truly all-purpose computer (on which we
might record such discussions) was relevant. The explicit introduction,
into a given discussion, of a few inclusion, projection, and evaluation
maps on a formal footing with addition, multiplication and a differential
equation, etc. clarifies and is a minor effort compared with the
complications and collisions attendant on an arbitrary monolithic scheme
for keeping them implicit. 

	Vaughan's continuing confusion comes he says from Goldblatt 12.4. 
More exactly, the few lines introducing 12.4 are `In order to...construct
models of set theory from topoi, we have to analyze further the
arrow-theoretic account of the membership relation'.  However, `the'
arrow-theoretic account of membership was actually totally omitted from
the book, though it should have been in section 4.1, along with the
discussion of related basic matters, such as subobjects and their
inclusions. (I return to this below).  For the stated narrow purpose of
constructing models of epsilon-based set theory, one indeed needs an
arrow-theoretic account (not of the mathematically useful relation but) of
the von Neumann rigid-epsilon monsters.  Goldblatt recites such an
account, as do several of the dozen or so texts on topos.  The
construction had been done around 1971 by each of Cole, Mitchell, and
Osius.  I had suggested the basic approach they used, but in so doing I
was just transmitting (in categorical form) what I had learned from Scott
about the 1950's work of Specker.  Specker is a mathematician (for example
it was he who taught R. Bott algebraic topology!) who realized that
transitive ZFvNBG `sets' can actually be seen as ordinary mathematical
structures (posets) which happen to satisfy some rather non-ordinary
conditions (such as no automorphisms, etc.).  Certain special morphisms
between these structures can be seen as `epsilons' and certain others as
`inclusions';  the functor which adjoins a new top element can be seen,
for the special structures, as `singleton', and permits to define those
two special classes of morphisms in terms of each other.  A further
insight concerning how these bizarre structures could be studied, if one
wished, in terms of ordinary mathematical concepts such as free
infinitary algebras, is elegantly explained in the recent L.M.S. Lecture
Notes 220 by Joyal and Moerdijk.  They too provide, on the basis of the
ordinary mathematical ground (of toposes and similar categories) a
foundation for those structures;  for anyone who is seriously interested
in those structures, that book should be an excellent reference.  However,
for anyone with potential to advance mathematics, such interest should be
discouraged, since the time and energy wasted on these things during this
century has vastly overshadowed any byproduct contribution to either
mathematics or to the foundation of mathematics.  Even most set-theorists
work mainly on problems with definite mathematical content (such as
Cantor's hypothesis, Souslin's conjecture, `measurable' cardinals, etc.
etc.) which have no actual dependence on these rigid epsilon chains for
their formulation and treatment.  That many mathematicians (including some
categorists) continue to pay lip-service to an alleged `foundational' role
of these chains can only be attributed to the general cultural
backwardness of our times;  similarly, certain natural scientists 300
years ago felt compelled to refer to a `hand that started the universe'
even though they knew it played no role in their work. 

       	It is my impression (though further sifting of the historical
record is needed to confirm it) that Hausdorff and other pioneers did not
actually give to the rigid epsilon the central role that von Neumann and
others later did.  Cantor had made several important advances, some of
which may have been submerged by the later attempt at a monolithic
ideology;  my paper on `lauter Einsen' in Philosophia Mathematica (MR'ed
by Colin McLarty) describes some potentially useful mathematical
constructions which were suggested by Cantor's work but which have
nothing to do with an external, rigidly imposed epsilon. 

	(Of course, one of Cantor's other contributions was the theorem
that non trivial function spaces are bigger than their domain space, which
he knew implied that no single set can parameterize a category of sets. 
It is amazing in hindsight how Frege and Russell managed to transform
this theorem into a propaganda scare concerning the viability of
mathematics, thus obscuring more serious problems with the `foundation',
such as the space-filling curves.)

	The omission by Goldblatt of the definition may have contributed
to Vaughan's further misconception that `by toposes...membership is
discussed only in power objects.' In the next two paragraphs I recall the
definition. 

	The elementary membership relation in any category is
straightforward, one of the two inverse relations for composition itself,
the one which Steenrod called the lifting problem:  `y is a member of b'
means by definition that there exists x with y = bx.  This of course
presupposes that y and b have the same codomain, and for uniqueness of the
proof x, that b is mono.  The mathematical role of these two
presuppositions must be understood. 

 	It became clear in the early sixties that the definition of SUBOBJECT
given by Grothendieck is not a pretense, circumlocution, or paraphrase,
but the only correct definition.  Here `correct' means in a foundational
sense, i.e. the only definition universally and compatibly applicable
across all the branches of mathematics:  a subobject is NOT an object, but
a given inclusion map.  The intersection of two objects has no sense, for
only maps (with common codomain) can overlap.  The category of sets is in
no way exceptional in this regard.  Singleton is not a functor of objects
but a natural transformation (from the identity functor to a covariant
power set functor in the categories where the latter exists .) Of course,
when I say `only definition' it is not meant to exclude consideration of
further mathematical conditions such as regular monos, closed monos etc
whose interest may be revealed by the study of the particular category;
nor should we long forget that subobjects are typically mere images of
fibrations wherein the question of whether there exists a proof of
membership is deepened to a study of particular sections.

	Equality is not obscure, it just keeps changing - but in ways
under our control.  Here I am speaking of the dual notion to membership,
which might be called `dependence' and is just the epic case of Steenrod's
extension problem.  In commutative algebra for example, what two
quantities `are' under a chosen homomorphism may become equal.  Neither
quotient objects nor subobjects have `preferred' representatives in their
isomorphism classes;  proposals to introduce such preferred
representatives have been justly ignored, since such would only
re-introduce spurious complications - of course in any topos further
objects do exist which can support maps that PARAMETERIZE precisely these
isomorphism classes . 

				****

	One topos becomes another. Only a very limited mathematical agenda
could have a favorite topos to stay in, because constructions that one is
led to make in E will lead to further toposes E' which are both of
interest in themselves and also further illuminate what is possible and
necessary in E;  indeed the most effective way to axiomatize E is to
specify a few key E' which are required to exist.  A topos that satisfies
both an existential condition concerning sections of epis and a
disjunctive condition concerning subsets of 1 is an important attempted
extreme case of constancy and non-cohesion, that usually in mathematics
becomes a more determinate category of variation and cohesion, modelled
via structures sketched by diagrams of specified shapes .  It may be
occasionally of interest however to consider still more extreme
affirmations of constancy such as the lack of objects both larger than a
given object and smaller than its power object;  Goedel's theorem to the
effect that such constancy can always be achieved was shown by W. Mitchell
to be independent of any extra-categorical structure such as the epsilon
chains which most people had assumed are inherent to the very idea of
`constructible'.  This might be clarified if Mitchell's tour de force
could be replaced by something more direct. 

	That startling result of Mitchell and its total lack of follow-up
was mentioned by McLarty during this interchange.  Mentioned by Loader was
another striking result which in its existing form still seems bound up
with the epsilon ideology, but which surely could contribute something to
the understanding of the category of abstract sets, namely the
Martin/Friedman work on Borel determinacy, as I discussed with Friedman
twenty years ago.  Union and intersection are shadows (in a proof-theory
sense) of sums and products, but in this case the tail wags the dog--why? 
The usual formulation that the replacement schema is required surely
depends on a special limitation of the class of theories:  how could one
statement require a schema?  Of course, the proof shows that something is
required but what?  Replacement can easily be made explicit in a topos, if
required;  indeed doing so makes it clearer that, in the case of abstract
sets, the essence of the schema is just to give more cardinals. 

				***

	The title of Goldblatt's book (and not only his!) is in itself
misleading.  The purpose of topos theory and category theory is not
primarily to provide an analysis of logic, but to permit the development
of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, differential topology and
geometry, dynamical systems, combinatorics, etc.  It emerged in the 1960's
that logic and set theory can and should be viewed as a special
distillation of this geometry.  In that way the actual achievements of
logic and set theory are, reciprocally, enjoying much wider mathematical
application.

I want to say something along the lines of "You can define abelian

internal logic of Ab."

Is this intuition supportable?  Ideally there would be a precise
technical sense in which it is provably the case.

Vaughan says -- correctly I think -- that "you can't define sets in the
internal logic of Ab." I suspect that the proof will have to use the
dualities that reside in Ab. Let  Gr  be the category of all groups,
abelian or not. Then:

    The category of co-groups in  Gr  is equivalent to  Set.

Cf:

    The category of co-groups in  Ab  is equivalent to  Ab.

"Co-group" means, of course, "group in the opposite category". The second
of the two assertions above holds for any additive category: it's easy to
show that each object in any additive category has a unique co-group
(indeed, a unique co-monoid) structure (the co-multiplication is the 
diagonal map). I know no citation for the first assertion. To prove it,
one shows that the only groups with co-group structures are free groups
and that the only co-multiplication on  Free(X)  is such that
X -> Free(X) -> Free(X+X)  is the point-wise product of the two functions 
of the form  X -> X+X -> Free(X+X).

   In the Spring of 1971 at Chicago, Peter Freyd gave some very
interesting lectures in which he showed how to construct a topos
from a symmetric monoidal closed category by considering certain
structured co-commutative co-algebras.  This was done in such a
way that for a group G one could recover the topos of G-sets
(and hence the group itself) from the category of linear 
representations.  Since the category of abelian groups has a
unique closed monoidal structure, this should refute Vaughan 
Pratt's conjecture.  It should have even many more applications
than that, which is why I have long urged Peter to write it up.

Peter Freyd succinctly shows you can't with

	The category of co-groups in  Ab  is equivalent to  Ab.

Interesting that Peter used duality to prove it, since my reason for
strongly believing it was also duality-based.  The general principle I
used for my reasoning was that the only categories "definable" in the
internal logic of a self-dual category are full subcategories of it.
FinAb is self-dual, but FinSet does not fully embed in FinAb.

If only I knew what "definable" meant this would be a proof.

I came to appreciate this principle while investigating Chu(Set,K).
All notions of "definable" I understand (e.g. first order definable)
are subsumed by this principle.  However that's not sufficient reason
to call it a theorem, since someone may have a method of definition I
don't know about that violates it.  For example I have not yet figured
out whether the method of sketches violates it, though I can't imagine
how it could.

	In fact, that is a ! operation, in Girard's
	sense, on the fragment of linear logic that Ab satisfies.  (This
	last was an observation of Jim Otto's.)

Is Jim's statement even well-defined?  ! is a functor projecting LL
onto a cartesian closed full subcategory of itself.  For the above to
make sense you would need a full embedding of the coalgebra category,
namely Set, back into Ab.  But unless I'm dreadfully confused (which I
often am) there isn't such.  What could a set reasonably be other than
the free abelian group on it?  But when you're inside Ab, Ab(G,H) = H
for H a fag, so that's not it.  Similar deal with Rel or CSLat.

I was dreadfully confused about this in 1991 when I first got involved
with duality via CSLat and their sibling Event spaces.  I wish someone
had pointed out to me that my ! *didn't* produce a cartesian closed
category as I was claiming.  Instead I had a long period of waiting for
my vision problems to clear up.

Adding ! to LL stretches LL out a lot, much wider than Ab with respect
to the Stone gamut (the Set<->Set\op axis).  Enough in fact to make it
look rather like Chu(Set,K) for indefinite K, less such amenities as
induction and such obscurities as 1 par 1 |- 1 (noticed by Lafont and
Streicher---with its contrapositive _|_ |- _|_ @ _|_, the two objects
1 par 1 and _|_ become sort of the "two halves" of a single coalgebra
in Chu(Set,K)).  You just have to take the bad with the good when you
have a nice model like Chu(Set,K).

I've incorporated my proof that Set is a bicomplete equational topos
(meaning one with all natural isos identities) into my LL'96 paper,
"Linear Logic complements Classical Logic," sent off last night.  In
the light of Peter Johnstone's remarks it seemed prudent to add an
explanatory paragraph as a sort of talisman against the nonmonotonic
logic of antiChoice fundamentalism extolled on Sundays.  This is now
available as ftp://boole.stanford.edu/pub/llcocl.ps.gz, with tex and
dvi counterparts in the usual subdirectories, /pub/TEX and /pub/DVI.
I'll post the abstract here shortly, or look it up yourself in the file
ABSTRACTS in the same directory.  This is paper 45 in that directory,
getting time to compress its scattered ideas down a bit.

        Linear Logic complements Classical Logic
        V.R. Pratt
        To appear in preliminary proceedings of Linear Logic '96, Tokyo

Classical logic enforces the separation of individuals and predicates,
linear logic draws them together via interaction; these are not
right-or-wrong alternatives but dual or complementary logics.  Linear
logic is an incomplete realization of this duality.  While its
completion is not essential for the development and maintenance of
logic, it is crucial for its application.  We outline the
``four-square'' program for completing the connection, whose corners
are set, function, number, and arithmetic, and define ordinal Set, a
bicomplete *equational* topos, meaning its canonical isomorphisms are
identities, including associativity of product.

From: Ralph Loader <loader@maths.ox.ac.uk>

Are there any categorical analogues of the reflection principles of set
theory?  I couldn't find any in the texts I have, or in the MathSci index.

These can be used to axiomatise ZF, and it should be possible to translate
them into category theory in a reasonably nice way, so as to give a
category theoretic account of ZF that is independent of such things as
elements.

Below is an account of how I think this could be done; my knowledge of the
category theory required is sadly lacking in places, suggestions and
criticism are very welcome.

(1) What are the reflection principles of set-theory.

Formal statement: let phi(x) be a first-order formula of set theory.  Then
the following is a theorem of ZF:

for all x, there exists an ordinal alpha such that (a) x in V_alpha and (b)
for all y in V_alpha, phi(y) iff 'phi(y) holds in V_alpha'.

'phi(y) holds in V_alpha' means the formula obtained by restricting all
quantifiers in phi to the set V_alpha (the V_alpha present the universe of
ZF as a union of an increasing sequence of sets). [By coding trickery, it
doesn't make any difference if we allow several formula with several free
variables to be reflected in the same V_alpha.  For our purposes, it's
useful to take alpha to be a limit ordinal, so that V_alpha gives a topos.]

In other words, the universe of ZF has lots of sub-universes that "look
just like" the original universe, where "looks just like" can be measured
by any particular formula phi.  [A more "dynamic" intuitive way of looking
at this is having constructed a universe V of set theory, we can take V to
be a set, and build a new universe V' containing it; in this new universe
V', the V_alpha required is the original V.]

(2) How do we translate these into category theory?

More specifically, take our universe to be a topos E.  How can we state a
reflection principle in E without reference to such things as the "V_alpha"
that seem fairly hideous monsters to a category theorist (even better would
be to get rid of first order formulae, also).

Presumably, we want to replace the V_alpha with an internal category C of
some sort, and then replace "x in V_alpha" with "x is an object of the
externalisation of C".  The statement "for all y, phi(y) iff 'phi(y) holds
in V_alpha'" can be replaced by that the externalisation of C is a
subcategory of E, and that the embedding preserves various things,
including the formula phi.  [My scant knowledge of such thing as
externalisations comes from Phoa's notes on fibrations, topos theory, the
effective topos and modest sets.  Apologies if I use terminology specific
to those notes.]

The V_alpha give subcategories of the universe of ZF in a fairly strong
sense, but I think it's enough to have C an internal category, such that
the externalisation of C is a full subcategory of E, in an appropriate
fibrational sense.  [This is probably far more than is needed].  The tricky
bit appears to be to get the notion of the inclusion preserving phi(x)
right.  I think that just taking phi(x) to be an arbitrary formulae of the
first order language of categories should be sufficient.  There are very
likely problems with differences between satisfaction in C and satisfaction
in its externalisation, but I'm ignoring this (fingers crossed).  Perhaps
the formulae phi could be replaced by finite sketches in an appropriate
manner (cf. Barr & Well's book), so as to get rid of logic, as well as set
theory.

I think we end up with something like the following definition:

A topos E "has reflection" if: for all finite sets {phi_i(x,y,z,...)} of
formula of the first order language of category theory, and objects/arrows
(as appropriate) a,b,c,... of E there are:

(a) an internal category C in E.

(b) a functor F embedding the externalisation of C (a fibration over E)
into the usual fibration of E^{arrow} over E.  This functor should be at
least full and faithful [maybe F needs to be defined in some natural way].

such that the following hold:

(c) a,b,c,... are in the image of F.

(d) For any I, and x,y,z,... in the fibre of the externalisation of C over
I, a formula phi_i(x,y,z,...) [from our finite set] should hold if and only
if phi_i(Fx,Fy,Fz,...) holds in the fibre of E^{arrow} over I.

Whew!  Does this make any sense at all?  I hope so, but I wouldn't be
surprised if it didn't.

(3) Let's do a sanity check to see if our definition looks anything like
the reflection principle of ZF.

V_alpha certainly generates a subfibration of the fibration of V over
itself.  There's a slight problem with the fibres over I where I is not in
V_alpha, in that the morphisms of that fibration won't generally be in
V_alpha.  However, I don't think that's a problem: since Set is well
pointed, hopefully we can restrict to the fibre over a singleton (?), and
which reduces us to the situation of V_alpha being a subcategory of V.
That the inclusion of V_alpha in V is full is essentially just the fact
that V_alpha is closed under cartesian products (for alpha a limit) and
subsets, so if A,B are in V_alpha, then the functions from A to B are also
in V_alpha.

The statement that phi holds in V_alpha if and only if it holds in V seems
to be the same, at least after translating a formula of category theory
into a formula of set-theory (morphisms are sets of ordered pairs etc.)  So
things don't look too bad.

That the language of set-theory has much more than category theory (under
this translation) tempts us to make C an internal topos, but this isn't
needed:

Lemma (I hope).  Let E be a topos with reflection.  Then E has an internal
topos.

Proof.  The statement that something is an elementary topos is well,
elementary, and finitely axiomatised (terminal object, pull-backs, cartesian
closed, subobject-classifier).  Apply reflection to the appropriate
sentences of first order logic axiomatising toposes.  Since they are true
in E, they are also true in the appropriate C, and thus we get an internal
topos.  Oh, better make this non-trivial (assuming that E is non-trivial),
"there is an arrow which isn't an iso".

Lemma.  This internal topos can be taken to be a full sub-topos of E in
some appropriate sense.

Proof.  As above, but also reflect the formulae "(f',g') is the pull-back of
f and g", "x is a terminal object", "tau: x --> omega is a sub-object
classifier" etc.

O.k., how about this:

Lemma (fingers crossed).  Let E be a non-trivial topos with reflection.
Then E has a natural numbers object.

Proof (very sketchy).

Let C be a non-trivial internal topos, as above.  We know that a (internal)
topos has coproducts.  Therefore we can generate a minimal subobject (in E)
N of C that (i) contains the initial object of C, (ii) is closed under x
|--> x+1 (the coproduct with the terminal object, in C).  Hopefully it's
not too hard to show that x|-->x+1 and 0 give N isomorphic to N+1 (in E),
which along with minimality gives us a natural numbers object.  [I've
entirely glossed over the non-uniqueness of co-products etc., I think this
can be made good by a quotient.]

(4)  Why should anyone be bothered with all this stuff?

(i) Hopefully it should give a nice topos-theoretic account of ZF,
independent of anything about elements etc.

(ii) The main application of reflection principles that I know of, outside
of set-theory, is category theory.  This makes (i) a little more important.
The reason is that reflection principles give us a nice, and very general,
way of working around small/large issues, which are normally glossed over
in category theory texts.  [This is not a criticism---category theory is
about category theory, not "limitation of size".  But it would be nice to
put it on a sound category theoretic basis.]

An example.  In Mac Lane and Moerdijk, page 12, it is stated that

  "In general we shall not be very explicit about set-theoretic
  foundations, and we shall tacitly assume that we are working in
  some fixed universe U of sets.  Members of U are called small sets,
  whereas a collection of members of U which does not itself belong
  to U will sometimes be referred to as a large set."

For concreteness, I'll assume that U is the universe of
ZF; although the following remarks seem in principle to be independent of
this.

On M&M, page 182, we have

  Corollary 4.  All toposes E have finite colimits.

So, having verified that the category Set^C of presheaves over some C^{op}
is a topos, we are justified in deducing that Set^C is also has finite
colimits?  Not quite.  The problem is that the proof M&M give of corollary
4 really only applies to small toposes; looking at the proof given, it uses
too much in the way of large functors etc. to apply directly to large
toposes.

Now, we could work around this directly; by replacing the argument for
corol. 4 given with an elementary one using diagram chasing.  This in
principle possible, at least for this result; both M&M and Johnstone give
examples (initial object and coequalisers) that should suffice to convince
all but the most strong-hearted that in general this would not be
desirable.  It also not "modular"---in the sense that a mathematician from
another field wishes to do this, (s)he has to learn enough about monads
etc. to actually carry this out.

Another possibility, is to use the completeness theorem from logic---since
the result is elementary, and has a proof for small toposes, it has an
elementary proof, and thus can be carried out in a large topos.  This is
unsatisfactory for several reasons (a) it only works for theorems; if
corol. 4 was merely a conjecture, or the hypothesis of an argument, then
the technique doesn't work [this is a slight over-simplification]. (b) it
depends on the logic of the universe U being classical, or at least being
formalised in such a way that a completeness result holds.  (c) it is not a
formalisable method; if you have a recursively axiomatised logic, including
arithmetic, in which this method can be formalised, then using Godel's
incompleteness theorem, it is possible to show that the logic is
inconsistent.

O.k., so a quick proof of

Corollary 5.  Let E be a large topos.  E has finite colimits.

Proof.  Let d be a finite diagram in E.  Apply the reflection principle
simultaneously to the formulae

"E is a topos"

and

"The finite diagram x has a colimit".

We now get a small sub-universe V (containing d) internal to which "E is a
topos" holds.  It is trivial (bounded formulae) to verify that the two
formulae above are absolute, in the sense that they are independent of the
universe they are interpreted in.  Thus "The diagram d has a colimit in E"
holds internally to the universe V, using corollary 4, and thus d has a
colimit in E.

(5) The other direction?  Construct a model of ZF from a topos E with
    reflection.

Should be possible.  The main things would be to construct, using
reflection, the cumulative hierarchy indexed by an arbitrary well-founded
relation in E.  Taking an appropriate "directed limit" (this would need to
be done outside of E, as if E had the colimit, presumably one could recover
the Burali-Forti paradox.) should give us the required universe.

Anyway, this is far too long.  Once again, comments welcome, even if it's
to tell me where I'm talking nonsense.

Ralph Loader.

Peter Freyd's assertion

is slightly incorrect. A better formulation should use the category
$Set_*$ of pointed sets instead of $Sets$. 
As such this is essentially an old result of
Peter Hilton and Beno Eckmann.
They proved that any cogroup in the category of groups is free.

I would like to say that the younger generation is not always 
aware that Eckmann and Hilton have fundamental contributions
to category theory. They have provided basic examples 
of objects equipped with algebraic structures in categories. 
Consequently opening the road to further abstractions,
like the concept of algebraic theory in the sense of Lawvere.

Among other things, Eckmann and Hilton where interested in identifying
all cogroups in the homotopy category $hTop_*$ of pointed topological spaces.
A basic example of such cogroup is the circle $S^1$.
It explains why the functor $\pi_1(-)=[S^1,-]:hTop_*\to Sets$
has a natural group structure. If $G$ is a cogroup
in $hTop_*$ then so is the smash product
$X\smash G$ for any pointed topological space $X$
This is because $X\smash(-)$ preserves coproduct since it
has a right adjoint (here we are supposing that Top is a convenient category
of topological space). In particular, the spheres $S^{n+1}=S^n\wedge S^1$
have a cogroup structure. Any wedge (topologists call the coproduct
the wedge) of cogroups is obviously a cogroup. In
particular, any wedge of spheres of dimension $n\geq 1$
has a co-group structure.
All the known examples of cogroups in $hTop_*$ are obtained
by taking a smash $X\smash S^1$.
It was conjecture by Eckmann and Hilton that all cogroups
in $hTop^*$ are of the form $X\smash S^1$. 
They observe that $\pi_1(G)$ is a cogroup in $Groups$
when $G$ is a cogroup in $hTop_*$.
This is because the functor
$\pi_1: hTop_*\to Groups$ preserves coproducts
by Van Kampen theorem.
In support to their conjecture
they proved that
any cogroup in $Groups$ is free.
It follows that all cogroups in $Groups$ are of the form
$\pi_1(X\smash S^1)$ where $X$ is a pointed set.

After giving more thought to my question about Set vs. Ab I decided
that it was hopeless to try to resolve as a theorem, and that the
only way out was to resolve it with a definition.

Definition.  A category C is *definable in* a closed category D when it
embeds fully (as a category) in every self-dual closed category
embedding D (as a closed category).

This definition settles by fiat the question of whether *finite* sets
can be defined from finite groups, since FinAb is self-dual, as I
mentioned previously.  Extending this to Ab is a matter of checking
that Set does not embed in Ab\op x Ab, which would surprise me
greatly.

If Set actually does embed in Ab, as some have been telling me
privately, this does not contradict my definition, it merely answers my
original question in the other direction.  To convince me that Set
embeds in Ab it will suffice for you to give me representatives of 2
and 3 whose homobjects between them are the representatives of 4, 8, 9,
and 27.

If you have a more productive notion of "definable in", meaning one
that lets you define categories not possible with the above, there is a
possibility that some trace of Set has leaked into your definition.
If, after convincing yourself that all traces of Set have been
eliminated, it is *still* more productive, then this would be a notion
of "definable in" well worth discussing.

It occurs to me that the arguments that have been advanced against
membership can be strengthened to a mathematical proof that the usual
notion of membership as a 2-valued binary relation is an inconsistent
notion.  That is,

Theorem.  Membership does not exist.

Proof.  Clearly the universe exists, or we're in serious trouble.  But
if membership also exists then the Cantor-Russell argument leads to a
contradiction.  QED


My real point here is that the Cantor-Russell argument doesn't *really*
prove there is no universal set, or no 2-valued membership relation, or
that some sets we can name are not in the universe, or that the
universe we exist in must be different from the one in which
mathematical objects exist, or that we are arguing with an unreliable
logic.

What it proves is the sentence "false."

Anything powerful enough to prove false is a theorem of the universe
dual to ours.  Such a theorem is a gedanken wavefunction.  To bring it
into our universe it has to collapse to a Gedankeneigenfunction of the
operator by which we observe it, that is, our logic.

When you are young and unobserved you are just some gedanken
wavefunction.  When you become observed, whether for the purpose of
influencing future generations or getting tenure, you collapse to one
of the schools of thought constituting the Gedankeneigenfunctions of
the observation operator, whether set theorist, or category theorist,
or intuitionist, etc.  That is, you have to take a stand or risk
failure to communicate.

I have tried to communicate without taking a stand.  I may have
underestimated the disadvantages of not collapsing to a
Gedankeneigenfunction.  There's a lot to be said in favor of collapse.

	Your proof of nonexistence of the universe is short and convincing.
	But why do you call it membership?

Bill Lawvere visited Stanford in 1988 to give a talk and share ideas.
I vaguely registered that his (cream-colored?) jacket had a Members
Only label, and I found myself wondering why I was noticing such a
trivial detail, and why it kept coming back to haunt me in the
intervening years.

As I stared at your message, John, trying to decide which of its ten
meanings you most likely intended, free associating like crazy,
suddenly the irony hit me.  Thanks!  God knows how much longer it would
have taken otherwise for my subconscious to deliver this particular
message.

I should explain what gave rise to my very off-the-wall posting.  I'd
asked a well-known set theorist where set theorists preferred to set
the boundary between the ordinals that existed and those that didn't,
or whether they didn't try, and the exchange that followed was about
what you'd expect of two explorers from different solar systems meeting
and trying to find a common alphabet, lexicon, syntax, and semantics in
that order.

But we got there, and I thought, ah, *this* must be what a wavefunction
feels like when its pushed out of one eigenstate of an operator into
another.  (Nothing contradictory there when you analyze it in terms of
a second operator whose eigenstates are different from the other one,
applied for the purpose of temporarily getting out of an eigenstate of
the other operator.)

The metaphor doesn't have to be quantum mechanics.  Instead of two
operators you could have two drains and one plug in your bathtub.  The
water will pick a direction to swirl as one of the two eigenstates of
the open drain, and will then get nudged out of that eigenstate when
you move the plug over to the other drain.  The first open drain
represents conferences and journal publication in some discipline, and
its eigenstates represent schools of thought in that discipline.  The
other represents a method of getting out of the rut so that you have a
chance when you do go back to the first drain of finding yourself in
the other eigenstate.  Provided the operators are sufficiently
orthogonal you can expect this method to succeed after two tries on
average (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...).

I only know of analog metaphors for this phenomenon, which it seems to
me nicely describes the relationship between the competing schools of
foundations and the Cantor-Russell-Goedel paradox.  (To which some
people these days add Heisenberg, I'm on the side that likes this
connection, but there's plenty on the other side too.)

In the absence of discrete metaphors I'm not sure I can add anything
helpful to this.  If the above doesn't do it, well, it was just a silly
idea then.

(Sorry this got so long.)

	From: peterj@maths.su.oz.au
	Vaughan Pratt seems to be challenging the rest of us to find
	something wrong with his ordinal-based definition of Set, and
	no-one else has taken up the challenge; so I'll have to break
	my vow and point out its obvious shortcoming.

Peter's points are sufficiently well taken as to deserve both careful
reflection and measured response.  I apologize for the one-liner on
Monday referring to Peter's Sunday message in the middle of a
postscript advertising my LL'96 paper, which violated both of these.
Cryptic responses only clog everything up.

Peter argues that Choice should be avoided in constructions, on the
following ground.

	I suppose only a minority of mathematicians are unhappy about AC
	to the extent of actually rejecting any construction that can't be
	done without it. But I think a very large majority would be unhappy
	about calling upon God to construct things for them (such as the
	real numbers) for which they know there is a perfectly good 
	man-made construction. Such people are going to be in a near-
	permanent state of unhappiness if they are condemned to do
	mathematics inside Vaughan's category.

===================

1.  Defense of Choice

Before I address the distinction Peter draws here between natural chaos
and mathematical artifact, I'd like to put in a word for Choice, which
Peter isn't exactly leaping to defend.

Using Choice is like wearing eyeglasses.  The wearer barely sees them
but sees the world more clearly.  The *observer* of the wearer on the
other hand sees the glasses directly as the wearer's baggage or
ornament, and is only indirectly aware of the wearer's improved
vision.

Using Choice lets you prove more theorems, but they also shorten
existing proofs, sometimes significantly.  There is no shortage of
examples, but just to point to the case under discussion, if you
organize a category-with-epsilon-trees along the lines I was
suggesting, the construction of epsilon reduces to the equation
\epsilon = <.  At a fraction of a line, this is significantly shorter
than the published constructions, which seem to require a lot more.

Long proofs cloud our mathematical vision.  A shorter proof shows us
the same result but by a path that makes its truth clearer.  The proof
as the means is a sine qua non, but that does not make it the end, the
truth is the end (wearing my Platonist hat for now).

The counterpart to the observer of the wearer of eyeglasses is that
movie critic of the foundations world, the axiom system critic who
worries about excess baggage, ornamentation, and/or legislation.  Why
interfere with the natural course of things when with just a little
accommodation of nature by longer proofs we can leave her unfettered by
legislation?

Unfortunately all known ways of building a house seem to entail some
disturbance of nature, and this commendable environmental concern is in
impractical conflict with the requirement that your house have a
picture window with a clear view of mathematical truth.

Quantum mechanics and Choice are in much the same boat.  Neither makes
as direct contact with the truth as F=Ma or x+y=y+x, but both are
better understood as sharpening vision, providing respectively the
physicist and the mathematician with eyeglasses.  In time they may come
to feel like absolute truth, but this is a slow process.

Arguing against Choice, understood internally, applies nonmonotonic
logic to restrict what can be deduced.  It is fundamentalist in its
rejection of sophisticated reasoning supporting clear thinking.  (Sorry
if that's too cryptic, happy to explain privately if this worries you.)

=============

2.  Toposes with inclusion

	Such people are going to be in a near-
	permanent state of unhappiness if they are condemned to do
	mathematics inside Vaughan's category.

At first I had interpreted this to mean that mathematicians would be
unhappy working with reals that had bits of the membership relation
dangling off them.  This seemed no objection at all; of course the user
doesn't want construction materials on his nice stuff.  The builder has
to clean up after construction, or the user isn't obliged to pay the
bill in full.  But even if the builder doesn't do it, the user can
always spend a bit extra to do it himself, and the upshot is the same.

But a day or so later, after rereading

	even if [AC] does [hold], you don't have the ability to point
	to a particular object of it and say "This is the set of real
	numbers" (still less to point to a particular morphism and say
	"This is the addition operation on real numbers"); you have to
	rely on God's (or "the randomizer's", as Vaughan seems to call
	him) ability to do it for you.

it occurred to me that perhaps Peter was interpreting my construction
as meaning quite literally that I was proposing to name reals with
ordinals.  This certainly would make the users permanently unhappy.  My
interest in this stuff is ultimately as a user, and I would be
unhappiest of all because such a user-unfriendly system would have been
my fault, and because it would have been a complete waste of effort.

I suppose I could just ask Peter which he meant (or was it something
else again?).  However both are plausible concerns, and I can think of
equally good and more or less independent responses to them, which I'll
give now.

For the first, I'll define what I'll call for the moment an itopos, for
topos-with-inclusion, along with a forgetful functor from itoposes to
toposes.  (This might be better done for categories in general; here
I'm only concerned about clarifying one topos.)  For the second I'll
point to a particular object of my category and say "This is a monoid
embedding the monoid of nonnegative reals as its bounded sequences, the
rest being nonstandard reals", and point to a particular morphism and
say "This is the addition operation on this monoid, whose restriction
to the standard nonnegative reals is standard addition").  This will do
double duty as a constructive refutation of Peter's objection and as an
interesting (to me), short, and I believe new construction of the reals
that bypasses *all* the many intermediate constructions in the standard
constructions, *and* produces the nonstandard reals more simply than
previous constructions (that I'm aware of) as a potentially useful
spinoff.

A topos with inclusions is no big deal (though it might be if worked
out more carefully than here).  Its point is to make explicit the
identity of the elements of sets, in part because it is useful in its
own right in some situations, in part because it clarifies what is
being erased when we claim to erase construction details.

The identities of a topos are those of a category, defined by a map
i:O->M.  An *itopos*, or topos with inclusions, extends the notion of
identity to a preorder on the objects as a subcategory of the topos.
An *extensional* itopos makes this a partial order.

This entails an extension not so much of the signature of a topos
itself as just an increase in the arity of identity, as a function from
objects to morphisms, from one to ordered two, i.e.  not just the
diagonal but the "upper triangle" of the homfunctor when a partial
order, plus squares on the diagonal when a preorder.

The inclusions need to be coordinated with the topos structure, not
done here (a good thing too if this is all old hat, which seems rather
likely given that it is a rather obvious notion).

The strict inclusions for the itopos OSet (for Ordinal Set) that I
constructed the other day were already described then as the
nonidentity maps from i to j that are the left inclusion of i into
i+(j-i).  In other words just ignore the excess of j over i and map
bijectively and monotonely to what remains of j.

Application.  In an itopos one can define the usual Boolean operations
on sets in the (large) distributive lattice of inclusions (omit the
downward remainders), knowing that the intersection of two sets
contains the very elements that show up in common in those two sets,
not mere stand-ins for them.

Cleaning up.  There is an evident forgetful functor from OSet to Set,
obtained by decrementing the arity of identity to leave only the
diagonal identities, those in Set(X,X).

The practical impact of forgetting the nondiagonal identities is that
functors between toposes need preserve only the retained identities.
If you find a need to preserve epsilon structure, it means you should
be working in the itopos.  This addresses Mike Barr's point, which he
mentioned as confirming with Makkai, about most applications ignoring
the epsilon structure.  Erasing the off-diagonal identities makes it
official.

===============

3.  Nonstandard analysis without tears

Definition.  The nonstandard nonnegative reals form the set
\omega^\omega of sequences of natural numbers, modulo the following two
equational universal Horn clauses whose variables range over sequences,
with addition understood as pointwise.

	1.  2(a/2) = a
	2.  a + c = b + c   ->   a = b

The function 2a doubles every element of sequence a:  (3,2,..) |-> (6,4,...)

The function a/2 shifts the sequence right, setting the leading digit,
indexed by 0, to 0.  (3,2,...) |-> (0,3,2,...).  Think of halving a
binary numeral by shifting.

End of construction.

It can easily be seen that the clauses will not identify an unbounded
sequence with a bounded one.  The standard nonnegative reals are
extracted from this monoid as the (equivalence classes of) bounded
sequences.  The real denoted by the sequence a_i is
sum(a_i / 2^i),i<\omega, in other words ordinary binary notation.

Example.  The ultimately constant sequences (1,0,0,0,...) and
(0,1,1,1,...) denote the respective reals 1.00... and 0.111... in binary
notation.  These are identified by the following computation:

	1.111...  =  0.222... 	by 1
	1.000...  =  0.111...   by 2, with c = 0.111...

A little work shows that every bounded real is identified by clauses 1
and 2 with a sequence all of whose elements but the leading "digit" are
0 or 1, and which if ultimately constant ends in 0's.  This of course
is the standard binary representation for real fractions, but with a
single digit in "radix" \omega for the integer part.  It should be
clear that pointwise addition is ordinary real addition for such reals,
with infinite carries propagating in finite time as in the example.

This construction makes these standard and nonstandard nonnegative
reals a monoid.  The same technique that extends the natural numbers to
the integers extends these nonnegative reals to the standard and
nonstandard reals, of which the standard reals then form a ring (define
multiplication as all endomorphisms of the monoid, made a binary
operation by associating each endomorphism with where it sends 1) and a
field as usual, the standard field of reals.

Every real in this monoid being bounded away from zero, the whole
monoid without the nonstandard reals cannot form a field, though the
above definition of the ring satisfies the ring axioms by
construction.

But we can easily extend it to a field by the same means by which the
integers are made the field of rationals: define an ireal (possibly
infinite or infinitesimal real) to be a pair a/b of nonstandard reals,
modulo the implication ad = bc -> a/b = c/d.  This produces with very
little fuss a field suitable for nonstandard analysis without tears.

These constructions can all be carried out as operations on objects of
the category Set, as a topos obtained by my construction from OSet.
All terms used in the construction are made explicitly available in the
construction I gave, as part of its signature as a bicomplete topos.
No trace of the randomness in the choice of well-ordering of
\omega^\omega participates in the construction, which should be
understood as merely proving existence and properties of the topos
thereby constructed, with the proof erased when done.

Here is an indication of how this construction could go, at least for
the nonstandard reals.

Start with two copies of \omega^\omega, for respectively a and b in
clause 2 of the definition.  Make \omega^\omega copies of
\omega^\omega, one for each c.  From the copy for c, delete all
sequences pointwise less than c.  Send maps a+c, b+c from a,b to c
respectively.  Now make one more copy of \omega^\omega and send maps
x-c from c to it.  (Note that monus never "underflows", because we
deleted those elements.)  The colimit of this diagram implements 2.
1 is an easy coequalizer.  That's it.

For the promised addition morphism, very roughly speaking, start from
+:\omega^2->\omega, form +^\omega, and apply to this morphism the same
operations that were applied above to the objects, all of which are
functorial.

Getting from here to the ireals is a matter of constructing the
"integers" then the "rationals" with any standard approach, starting
with \omega^\omega instead of \omega.

This construction was described as an infinite diagram for conceptual
simplicity.  It can be made finitary with first order logic or
adjunctions, however you prefer to look at it.  Hopefully all
operations needed for this conversion are already in the signature
provided for Set; if not the signature needs more oomph.

Has anybody experience in mechanizing category theory or knows of such work? 
I'm about to implement basic parts of category theory in a tactical theorem 
prover based on higher order logic. I would appreciate to learn from anybodies 
earlier experiences.

Thanks in advance,

Clemens

There's a sense in which by reasoning non-classically (specifically, with
geometric logic) you can eliminate the need for explicit topology:

  if you define points by a geometric theory, then the topology is implicit
  if you define a map by geometric constructions, then continuity is automatic

>From this point of view, the purpose of explicit topology is to correct the
errors introduced by classical reasoning.

We thus see sophisticated reasoning (classical principles) necessitating
complicated thinking (topology), the reverse of what was intended. You
don't need dogma to see this could be a bad idea, though you do need hard
work to see whether the classical principles really can be dispensed with.

	From: Reinhard Brger, Prof. Pumpl n <Reinhard.Boerger@FernUni-Hagen.de>

	Since the set of maps from a non-empty set to the empty set is empty
	and since Ab x Ab\op has no empty hom-sets, there is no full
	embedding from Set to Ab x Ab\op. Does that answer your question?

Not if I understand you, for two reasons.  First, you said the word
"hom-set" which isn't allowed in Ab---you have to say homgroup (or
homab).  There being no empty group, if Set embeds in Ab then the empty
set must embed as a nonempty group.  Emptiness in the sense definable
via the forgetful functor U:Ab->Set is not a predicate known to be in
Ab.  Emptiness needs to be defined in terms of the Abelian group
representing the empty set.

You have to analyze any proposed embedding by treating both the objects
and the homobjects between them as Abelian groups.

The second problem is my fault.  I noticed yesterday that my definition
(repeated below, near the end) is too weak.  As a simple
counterexample, groups are well known to be definable in Set, but Grp
certainly does not fully embed as a category in the closed self-dual
category Set + Set\op (= Chu(Set,0)), which embeds Set as a closed
category (that is, the embedding respects tensor products, not
necessarily cartesian products).  The objects are just sets and
antisets, clearly nowhere to store Grp.

I was basing my definition on two theorems of mine.

1. Every category of relational structures, and hence every full
subcategory thereof definable by any wacky language you want, far
wilder and less computable than first order logic, fully embeds in
Chu(Set,2^k) where k is the total arity of the structure.

To determine total arity k of a multisorted multirelation structure,
form the disjoint union of all the carriers, add one unary predicate
per carrier as a marker, and then form the "natural join" of all the
relations.  The embedding works for total arities up to any ordinal;
for a proof look near the end of

	http://boole.stanford.edu/gamut.ps.gz


2.  Every small concrete category embeds in Chu(Set,K) for some set K.

Proof: Take K to be the disjoint union of the carriers of the objects,
and proceed as in

	http://boole.stanford.edu/embed.ps.gz

On the strength of these two theorems I speculated that any method of
defining a category that confined its language to that of V would embed
in Chu(V,k) for a suitable object of k.

What does "confine language" mean?  Terrible things!  It might even
entail giving up conventional equality in favor of weighted limits when
V is not cartesian closed, as with Ab.  Some of you might enjoy a world
where equality didn't exist, not in the sense you have to settle for in
Set where you have to convince skeptical students that equality doesn't
exist, but in the more pragmatic sense that no one else in that world
uses it either, because it really doesn't exist!

What I forget to allow for in my definition was the variability of k.
Larger k lets you define more.  k functions as a simple but effective
and pure notion of signature.  Pure in the sense that the 256 colors on
your monitor are the clean signature of pixel depth, purified of the
grubby representational issues implied by talking instead of the 8
pixel planes as though each plane were a real thing.  This
representation is clearly meaningless for people whose computers have 6
pixel planes coding 729 colors in ternary.

I had foolishly thought that the essence of the Chu construction could
be purified to a statement about duality, but had clean forgotten to
allow for the possibility that a definitional method might cunningly
think to use language to express the definition!

Just how little language can be present in a self-dual category
embedding Set can be can be seen from the example above of Chu(Set,0),
a self-dual category consisting *only* of sets and antisets (aka CABA's
if you ignore concreteness issues).  The sets are realized as the
inconsistent Chu spaces (A,0), the antisets as the empty Chu spaces
(0,A), with (0,0) as the one set that is also an antiset.  (Obviously
this doesn't work for what Dusko Pavlovic calls "little Chu," no
repeated rows and columns.) Chu(Set,0) understood skeletally consists
of just the "dynamic integers," thinking of (0,A) as minus (A,0).  The
only subcategories of this sparse category have as their objects some
sets and some antisets.  This does not even embed Set\op x Set =
Chu(Set,1), which also is too small for anything much, e.g. no posets,
which enter at Chu(Set,2).

I see nothing for it for now but to be upfront about putting Chu in the
definition.

Old definition.  A category C is *definable in* a closed category V
when it embeds fully (as a category) in every self-dual closed category
embedding V (as a closed category).

New definition 1.  A category C is *definable in* a closed category V
when it embeds fully in the category Chu(V,k) for some k in ob(V).

This definition steers between the Scylla of arbitrarily large
self-dual categories and the Charibdis of self-dual categories barely
bigger than V.  It is also a tad shorter.

But there is *still* a problem.  In Set it is not hard to define
Chu(Set,*) as a colimit of Chu(Set,K1) < Chu(Set,K2) < ...  For example
the category of hypergraphs described in

	@Article(
DW80,	Author="D{\"o}rfler, W. and Waller, D.A.",
	Title="A category-theoretical approach to hypergraphs",
	Journal="Archives of Mathematics", Volume=34, Number=2,
	Pages="185-192", Year=1980)

does not to my knowledge embed in any Chu(Set,K) for any fixed K.
(This is an open question, I imagine mainly because no one has looked
hard at it.)  But any *small* subcategory of it does, by the general
result above that *every* small concrete category embeds in Chu(Set,K)
for some K.

This too is easily fixed.  There is a *nonclosed* category
Chu(Set,Set).  The definition looks no different from the usual
definition of Chu, except that in all small interactions (no proper
class of participants), all Chu spaces involved are taken to be over
the colimit of all their K's.  The only failure of this category to be
closed is its lack of tensor unit 1 and its dual _|_ (I've switched to
Girard's notation because these days it makes a lot more sense to me).
The rest of linear logic is fine; furthermore the absence of 1 and _|_
removes the odd-ball property 1@1 |- 1 that Lafont and Streicher
noticed.

With that and MIX gone, about all LL should need now is induction, and
Chu(Set,Set) should then be a complete model of LL without
multiplicative units.

If there is any justice, all this should generalize to Chu(V,V) by
arranging to embed the k's of any interaction of V-enriched Chu spaces
in the appropriate colimit of them in V before letting them interact.

This leads to the even shorter:

New definition 2.  A category C is *definable in* a closed category V
when it embeds fully in the category Chu(V,V).

In view of Dusko Pavlovic's paper on the couniversality of Chu, about
the only improvement likely for this definition (barring further bugs,
sigh) is to replace the explicit Chu construction by its abstract
properties.  The effect will be the same either way, though the
definition is presumably not going to get any shorter that way!

One residual question is how to do enriched category theory from
scratch in V.  Max, help!

----------------------------------------------

Clemens, there has been a good deal of work on the mechanisation of
category theory. I will mention some here and I am sure others will
contribute to complete the discussion.

The obvious starting point (for me!) is: 

	David Rydeheard and Rod Burstall.  Computational Category
	Theory.  Prentice Hall (1988).

This describes an encoding of constructions of (finite) limits, colimits
and of adjuctions and internal logics, and also constructions of categories, 
all coded in SML. It makes use of higher orer functions to code the 
universality of constructions and the parametric polymorphism to capture 
something of the level of abstraction of category theory. It does not include
correctness proofs within the code.

The code + examples are available over the WWW from my archive at Imperial
College (http://theory.doc.ic.ac.uk:80/tfm/papers/RydeheardD).

At about the same time as this was being developed, Roy Dyckhoff [1985] was
experimenting with implementing categories in an implementation of a 
Martin-Lof Type theory, Joe Goguen was implementing categories in OBJ 
and Tatsuya Hagino was developing his "categorical data types". 
These are all briefly described in the above book.

-----------------------

Now I come to the more invidious part: Trying to summarise what has happened since
without missing important contributions. I cannot do this in an email message
but will attempt to sketch some directions and others can contribute in their
own messages. 

One major direction has been to continue Roy Dyckhoff's work, using
implementations of various type theories as a basis for formalising
category theory (examples that spring to mind are: Gotheberg work in Alf,
the INRIA work in Coq, and the Edinburgh/Manchester (Aczel) work in LEGO). 

There has been other implementations of categorical algorithms and systems
including that of (1) Robin Cockett and his group, (2) Carmody and
Walters, (3) Michael Fleming and Ryan Gunther
ftp://sun1.mta.ca/pub/sources/rosebrugh/{unix,DOS}. 

There have been attempts to provide interactive tools for categorical
reasoning ("diagram chasing"). I believe John Gray had a Mac version.
Actually an early attempt to automate categorical reasoning is that of
Watjen and Struckmann (Inform. Proc. Letters 14, 3 [1982]). 

The work on "categorical data types" and "categorical programming languages"
has continued, eg [Hasegawa, LNCS 953].

There has been work on the normalisation properties of the (essentially
algebraic) theories of categories (with structure) 
(see eg. the PhD thesis of Wolfgang.Gehrke@risc.uni-linz.ac.at).

I'm sure that I have omitted important contributions. I'll let others
speak for themselves.

David

[Clemens, it may be worthwhile preparing and posting a comparative 
survey of these and other systems so that those interested can know 
what is available.]

Write CD(L) for complete distributivity of a complete lattice L.
Write CCD(L) for constructive complete distributivity of L, by which is 
meant that \/:DL--->L has a left adjoint, where DL is the lattice of
down-closed subsets of L, ordered by inclusion.

It is easy to show that CD==>CCD but many times in joint work with
Fawcett, Rosebrugh and Marmolejo I have been led back to the more
interesting
AC<==>(CD<==>CCD)    *

Without choice there is not much that one can prove about CD.
In fact, without choice there is a severe shortage of infinite L
satisfying CD(L). (Recall that AC is equivalent to `for every set X,
CD(PX), where P denotes power set'.) My experience suggests that
all theorems about CD follow from constructively proveable theorems
about CCD after invoking *. Those that my colleagues and I have 
discovered have reasonably ``short'' proofs, if one starts with some
basic knowledge of adjunctions.

Allow me to discharge the facile comment that by *, any theorem that has been
proved constructively about CCD (examples exist) proves that ``Using Choice
lets you prove more theorems'' because that is not the point of this note.

Rather, I think that * and similar results show that some of the
definitions and concepts that seem to arise rather ``naturally'' from
traditional set-based Mathematics are not particularly natural. Stepping
further away from Mathematics, I think that twentieth century Mathematics
has frequently sacrificed useful generalization for excessive abstraction.

	I would like to comment on Vaughan Pratt's

Phew, thanks Richard, no fun defending a position alone.

Here's another argument for Choice, no more or less a proof than the
clarity-of-mathematical-thought argument, it seems to me.

"Proof" of AC.  It took mathematics about thirty years longer to
imagine AC false than it did to imagine it true.

This "argument" can be applied in other situations.  Applying it to
Grothendieck universes (aka inaccessible cardinals) would suggest that
they don't exist.  We can imagine their nonexistence (their existence
is independent of ZFC) but so far we haven't been able to imagine their
existence (a proof in ZFC that they don't exist is still on the
cards).

What arguments exist in *support* of the existence of Grothendieck
universes?  I see the "cogito ergo sum" argument, what else?

Vaughan Pratt says
  <<What arguments exist in *support* of the existence of Grothendieck
  <<universes?  I see the "cogito ergo sum" argument, what else?>>
    I once asked Joe Shoenfield that -- not quite in those terms -- and his
answer certainly didn't seem to me "cogito ergo sum". That seems to me,
assuming I understand what argument you mean, not radically better than
Anselm's proof of the existence of God: we can imagine the best thing in the
world, and if it is the best it must exist (otherwise one that existed
would be even better), so it exists, QED. Now I don't suppose you mean a
White Knight's sort of argument -- the universe imagined me, therefore it
exists. You mean I imagine Grothendieck's universe, therefore IT exists.
Well, Joe said in effect I can tell you everything that goes to make up the
first Grothendieck universe, except I don't have time to finish telling you.
It's the null set, and the singleton of the null set, and [and on. Not just
countably, of course; we can describe \omega very satisfactorily, and the 
union of an omega-sequence of ordinals, and on. This differs from Anselm's
word game in being a string of constructions. The first Grothendieck
universe is rather large, so it is a fairly formidable kit of constructions.
Pass to a second Grothendieck universe, and you used at least one miracle, to
produce an individual from the first-universe construction.

         A Weekend Meeting on Category Theory and Its Applications

              YORK UNIVERSITY, North York (Metropolitan Toronto)

                      Saturday/Sunday, April 13/14, 1996

                            FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT

The meeting will begin on Saturday, April 13, with the first talk at 9 a.m.,
and end before 2 p.m. on Sunday. If you wish to attend the meeting and if you
have not sent your registration form yet, please do so at your earliest
convenience - especially if you wish to book a room through yorkcat or if you
wish to give a talk, and in any case before April 7. This will give the
organizers a chance to finalize hospitality arrangements in good time.
Send the form attached below to yorkcat@mathstat.yorku.ca.

All talks at the meeting will be held in  VARI HALL, Lecture Room D. Vari Hall
is located centrally on the York Campus at 4700 Keele Street in North York. It
is just east of the Ross Building, a large grey building visible from
everywhere; Vari Hall is a yellow brick building in front of Ross, with a
rotunda which connects it with Ross. Enter the building at the rotunda and
follow the signs to Lecture Room D. The busline 106 connecting the closest
subway station (SEE IMPORTANT NOTE BELOW) with York has its terminal stop
almost in front of Vari Hall. If you travel by car, turn west from Keele Street
into York Boulevard  (main gate of the campus) and use the first parking lot on
the right (Lot 1A); the fee is $5 on Saturday and $0 on Sunday. Walk west
towards Vari Hall. Slightly closer to Vari Hall is Lot DD where the Saturday
fee is $7.

The registration desk in front of Lecture Room D will be open beginning from
8:45 a.m. on Saturday. The fee of $25 for participants with full employment
($12 for others) will be used to pay for refreshments during the meeting and
for lunch on Saturday.

Participants and their spouses/friends are invited to a Welcome Party (wine and
cheese) at Walter Tholen's home on Friday night (April 12), beginning from 8
p.m. Address and directions (car and public transport) will be sent by email to
each participant. This mailing will also contain a short (and necessarily
subjective) list of recommended restaurants and Saturday night outings.

Complete information on Saturday night entertainment in Toronto as well as on
restaurants can be obtained by visting the conference web site at

http://www.math.yorku.ca/Who/Faculty/Tholen/tsm/tsm.html

Follow the various links to Toronto information sites. Most complete
entertainment coverage is at the electronic site of "Eye Weekly Magazine" which
will have up-to-date theatre/music/movie listings etc for the weekend of April
13/14 beginning from Thursday, April 11. There are also links to maps (city and
campus), weather forecast, and other potentially useful information sites.


IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PUBLIC-TRANSPORT USERS
The Toronto subway system is currently undergoing a small extension program
which affects travel to York University. Beginning from April 1, the closest
subway station is no longer "Wilson", but "Downsview". Hence, in the directions
given in the Second Announcement, "Wilson subway station" has to be traded for
"Downsview subway staion" as the starting point of bus line 106 leading to York
University. New bus and subway schedules have not been issued yet, but changes
are to be expected marginal since the new Downsview terminal is just one stop
further than Wilson.

We hope to see you at the Meeting!

	I once asked Joe Shoenfield that [...]
	Well, Joe said in effect I can tell you everything that goes to
	make up the first Grothendieck universe, except I don't have
	time to finish telling you.

Well, it's no worse than any of my existence "proofs" I suppose.  I
can't shoot it down with the argument that it would equally well prove
the existence of cardinals we already know not to exist, since the
extra time Joe would need to tell us everything that goes into making
up a nonexistent ordinal might disqualify that proof without
disqualifying the other.  :)

Further reflection on this merely seems to lead back to my original
point about there not being enough room in this town for both \in and
U.  If your U is an inaccessible cardinal, and inaccessible cardinals
*do* exist (and some set theorists seem to hope very badly they do,
despite knowing it cannot be proven in ZFC), then rejecting membership
is one reasonable way out.  Becoming an intuitionist is another.  Have
the reasonable alternatives proposed to date been collected in one
place and insightfully classified and compared?

The flip side of this is, if inaccessible cardinals are eventually
proved *not* to exist, then the Cantor-Russell paradox goes away for
those working in a Grothendieck universe.  But in that case the one
reasonable objection I've been able to grasp so far to membership,
namely its incompatibility with existence of one's mathematical home,
goes away too.

Is there any other argument against membership?  Preferably just as
short, but I'll settle for long if that's all that's possible.

Or is the rejection of membership all just touchy-feely stuff based on a
deep-seated feeling for something?

"The von Neumann rigid-epsilon monsters" alluded to by Bill Lawvere
sounds like it might be made into such an argument.  But as I pointed
out, when the only sets are the ordinals, one of each, the "monster" is
tamed to a gentle line +1'ing steadily along, with the occasional
little hiccup at each limit ordinal.  That's no monster.

A more convincing objection is needed.  There must be something else,
ideally something we are all very familiar with.

The smoothness of space, for example.

First off, even if physical space *is* smooth, why should this have any
more bearing on our mathematical spaces than their dimension?
Obviously no one can get away in these enlightened days with
legislating 3, 4, or 26 as an upper bound in mathematics.

Second, it is not even clear that the space we inhabit *is* smooth.
Start with

	http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~imamura/209/may8/may8.html

and look at what Vilenkin and Linde are proposing as an alternative
model of space: foam at fine grain.  Their idea that small distances in
space are chaotic makes much more sense to me than a model based on
extrapolating the smoothness of space-in-the-large down to arbitrarily
fine scales as though space were a mathematical manifold.
That extrapolation applied to the smoothness in the law of large
numbers in statistics for example is well-known to lead to nonsensical
results.

With the statistical analogy in mind, my only question about the
Vilenkin-Linde model is whether the appearance of chaos at fine scales
would be nicely explained by populating unit volumes with only finitely
many points.  It is very easy to construct smooth-in-the-large
manifolds from finite sets, and these will naturally look bumpy in the
small.

We would then have to add another physical constant to the books, the
number of points of space per cubic centimeter.

===================================


PS. I inquired on sci.math.research about my construction of the
nonstandard reals.  Vladimir Pestov at U. Wellington pointed out an
embarrassingly trivial oversight: I'd forgotten that the class of
fields subdivides into smaller elementary classes, and had not thought
to order my field (the standard part leaves no alternative, it can't be
an algebraically closed field).  You can't, at least not without
further restrictions on the sequences.

Luckily the standard part of my field *can* be ordered or I'd have to
come up with some other demonstration to Peter Johnstone that one can
identify the set of reals and its addition morphism without having to
say which ordinals go where.

More generally, any sequence can be named by its elements.  There is no
need to name it by whichever ordinal God picked this time around as the
placeholder in the set of sequences of which that sequence is a
member.

I can't imagine what Peter was thinking.  This sort of construction,
where you have to take down the scaffolding when you're done, goes on
all the time in ordinary mathematics.

It is available by anonymous ftp from

where it appears as the file Kock-Plewe.ps or Kock-Plewe.dvi .
It subsumes the paper by Kock, announced here on Feb. 15 1996,

Abstract: We prove the equivalence of some conditions on a complemented
subtopos of a topos, one of which is that the subtopos is locally closed,
and another is that abelian group objects in the smaller topos admit
prolongation by zero; the prolongation functor then has a right adjoint.

I think the word "despite" here misses the whole point.  It is precisely
*because* the existence of inaccessibles cannot be proven in ZFC, that
the assumption of their existence is interesting.  More exactly, this
is how we know that ZFC+inaccessibles is a proper (if modest) extension
of ZFC itself.

Now of course this is not to say that whenever ZFC fails to prove the
existence of some X that we should immediately assume "X exists"; among
other problems, that would quickly lead to an inconsistent theory.

Inaccessibles, however, have other merits:

	i)	If my model says there are inaccessibles, and
	yours says there aren't, it may just mean that your model
	is an initial segment of mine.  In that case my model

	yours does, and more besides; moreover, we haven't lost
	any nice features that your model might happen to have, because
	they are still true when prefaced by "in your model..." .

	ii)	Inaccessibles are an example of the intuition
	that says "anything we know how to do too well or too
	precisely, can't possibly tell the whole story; there
	must be more."  In this case what we know too well how to
	do is take exponentials of cardinals and limits of sequences
	of ordinals, where the length of the sequence is a cardinal
	we already have.  Strengthen this intuition to "things
	we can construct in L" and you start to see why 0# should
	exist.

Consistency is not a nice feature?  News to me.  My model is more
likely to be consistent than yours.  Inconsistency of yours would be a

Inconsistency of mine would be a magnitude-9 earthquake!

Furthermore mathematics has had no trouble imagining my model since
1939 when Goedel showed us how.  It is *very* hard to imagine your
model, so hard that not even the smartest people in the world have been
able to do it in over half a century of trying.  This is *not* a good
sign.

	Strengthen this intuition to "things

This is an argument for assuming the existence of everything whose
nonexistence you can't actually *prove*.  But that forces you to
retreat every time we disprove the existence of yet another ordinal.
Such discoveries happen periodically, and do not astonish working
mathematicians.

A much more stable approach would be to accept the easily imagined, and
reject what is hard to imagine.  Following that strategy, you only have
to retreat in the face of 50-year or even 200-year earthquakes.

Anyway, what are we arguing about here?  What exactly *is* the
advantage of assuming inaccessibles?  (Let's not tempt fate and get too
close to inconsistency by assuming measurables!)  Sure you can shorten
some contrived proofs a lot with inaccessibles, but can you shorten a
proof some mathematician might care about?  Or do anything else useful
with them?

Careful with language.  Models are not consistent or inconsistent;
they simply exist or fail to exist.  Consistency is a property of
*theories*.

If my model exists, then it is better than yours.

I do not know what you might mean by this.  I have no difficulty
whatsoever in imagining inaccessible cardinals.

If you mean I can't imagine everything that might happen *below* an
inaccessible cardinal I plead guilty, and challenge you to imagine
all ordinals below Aleph_1.

>This is an argument for assuming the existence of everything whose
>nonexistence you can't actually *prove*.

No, not everything:  For example I don't assume the existence of a proof
of 0=1 from ZFC, even though I can't prove the nonexistence of such
a proof.  In my first article I tried to give an idea of why I assume
one and not the other.

>But that forces you to
>retreat every time we disprove the existence of yet another ordinal.

-------IF YOU READ NOTHING ELSE IN THE ARTICLE, READ THIS PARAGRAPH---------
Science is a continual process of assuming things that might be proved
wrong, taking the chance that you may later be forced to retreat.  Read
"Conjectures and Refutations" by Karl Popper.

>A much more stable approach would be to accept the easily imagined, and

Truly, I think you are much overestimating the difference between
ZFC and ZFC+inaccessibles.  To prove a contradiction from ZFC+inaccessibles,
or even ZFC+measurables, would be earthquake enough for me; but even
a contradiction from ZFC would have little effect on most everyday
mathematics as long as it didn't go through in, say, 2nd-order PA.

>Anyway, what are we arguing about here?  What exactly *is* the
>advantage of assuming inaccessibles?

Well for example, if inaccessibles exist then we *know* choice is
necessary to prove the existence of a nonmeasurable set of reals.

If measurables exist then every analytic set of reals (i.e. projection
of a Borel set in the plane) is measurable.

From: Thomas Streicher <streicher@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>

Dear all,

I have been following the discussion on toposes vs. set theory on the network.
The discussion has reminded me of a more ``pragmatic problem'' that a student 
of mine (B. Reus) had to face when formalising some variant of Synthetic Domain
Theory in a very strong impredicative type theory : Calculus of Constructions
with Inductive Types, Extensionality for Functions and Axiom of Unique Choice.
This is almost topos logic : what is missing is the principle that equivalent
propositions are equal but one has the further assumption of a small internal
complete universe.

Anyway, the ``pragmatic'' problem he had to face when actually working inside
the formal system was HOW TO DEAL WITH SUBTYPES.
Notice that the notion of subtype is not the object-oriented one from Computer
Science but the good old-fashoned one from Logic. I will now explain more
explicitely what I mean.

If A is a type and P is a predicate on A then in everyday mathematics 
one does not hesitate to form the type

   { x : A | P(x) }  .

This, of course, is no problem in set theory BUT it definitely is a problem in
higher order logic (HOL) because in the latter one does not have the 
possibility of ``subtype formation'' 
which allows one to turn a predicate into a type.

Now it seems to me that topos logic is more expressive than type theory in
the sense that it allows subtype formation. When one extends HOL by subtype 
formation then any subtype

  { x : A | P(x) } 

has to be accompanied by an inclusion map

    iota_A,P : { x : A | P(x) } >--->  A
    
(together with some axioms governing its use; actually, the only place 
where I could find them spelled out in detail 
is in some lecture notes by Wesley Phoa).

The ``pragmatic'' problem now is that when  a \in A and  P(a) then 
one is not allowed to state

  a \in { x : A | P(x) }   BUT ONLY  iota_A,P(a) \in { x : A | P(x) } .
  
Now when it comes to formalise arguments in HOL augmented by logical
subtypes then notation gets really clumsy as one has to mention the
subtype inclusions all the time.

(Notice that in dependent type theory one can express

  { x : A | P(x) }  as  (\Sigma x : A) P(x)
  
and  iota_A,P is projection on the first argument (saliently assuming
that propositions are ``proof-irrelevant'', i.e. any proposition considered
as a type contains at most one element)).

Now -- to my opinion the ``pragmatic'' superiority of (naive) set theory
over HOL with subtypes is that one may omit all the ``iotas'' and what one
writes down is much more concise. So it is precisely this notational
convenience which makes naive set theory a better linguistic tool for
communicating mathematical constructions and arguments.

But notice that this sloppiness of omitting subtype inclusions renders the
``type-checking'' undecidable -- when one would insist on staying in a typed
framework because in order to check whether

    7653 \in  { x : N |  P(x) }
    
one has to PROVE

    P(7653)
    
which actually is a problem when P is not semidecidable, e.g. when
P(x) is a  Pi-0-1-formula (which e.g. states the consistency of the
formal system in use).

!! It is precisely this undecidability of type-checking which forces us to
stick to an untyped universe despite the fact that in ordinary mathematical
arguments one almost never exploits the strong comprehension principles
of ZF(C)
!!

I am always puzzled by the following two slogans

(1)   Topos Logic    corresponds to      Set Theory
  
(2)   Topos Logic    corresponds to      Higher Order Logic

which can be found in the topos-theoretic literature.  
It cannot be the case that both slogans are literally true 
as one can prove the consistency of Higher Order Logic inside Set Theory 
and therefore Set Theory must be more expressive than Higher Order Logic 
(unless one renders G"odel's Second Incompleteness Theorem to be wrong).

The slogan I would have in mind would be

  Topos Logic     corresponds to      Higher Order Logic with Subtypes .
  
Of course, from the point of view of proof-theoretic strength nothing is
gained by adding Subtypes to Higher Order Logic 
(as this way one surely cannot prove more algorithms to terminate).

So I can understand the slogan   

    Topos Logic    corresponds to      Higher Order Logic
    
in the sense that the logics are equiconsistent.

I definitely would like to know from the experts in topos theory 
which of the correspondences (1) or (2) above is the intended one.
Please, note that this question is not meant as a provocation 
but it simply is curiosity about what the acting person thought 
when slogans (1) and (2) were promoted (beginning of the 70s I presume).

Finally, I would like to ask whether the following impression of mine
is absolutely misleading : 
the correspondence between BZF and topos theory given in the book of
Mac Lane and Moerdijk is a mere equiconsistency result saying that there
is a nontrivial elementary topos iff there is a consistent model of BZF.
If I remember correctly there are given 2 constructions : one turning a
model of BZF into an elementary topos (easy) and a second more complicated
one constructing a model of BZF from an elementary topos.
But that does NOT give an EQUIVALENCE bewteen toposes and models of BZF
as far as I can see.
When I start with a topos E then I get a model M of BZF which in turn gives
rise to a topos E_new but, in general, E and E_new will not be equivalent 
anymore.
Right ??

Sorry for that lengthy and maybe shallow remarks but it is really this
``what I always wanted to know but never dared to ask'' sort of question(s) 
which I now dare to ask as the arena seems to have been opened already
for ``fluffy'' questions.

Careless of me.  ZFC is enough on its own to prove that every analytic
set is measurable, either countable or contains a perfect subset, and
has the property of Baire.

Measurables get you the same results one real quantifier higher; i.e.
for projections of co-analytic sets.

For future reference, if I notice an error after making a submission
on lists like this, can I write the moderator and ask to make a correction?

 		  TRAVEL INFORMATION			
 						
*********************************************************

Munich offers good access by air, rail, and road. The new Munich  
International Airport has frequent flights to and from most major cities. By  
rail, the city offers easy access to the major European centers.

The area of Munich is well served by the "S-Bahn" and the city by  
underground. There are single tickets (to be bought for each trip) or stripe  
cards ("Streifenkarte") which are relatively cheaper when used for several  
trips. Using a stripe card one has to cancel two stripes for any trip within  
Munich-City and eight stripes for one trip from Munich airport to the city  
(or conversely).

HOW TO REACH THE CONFERENCE SITE AND THE HOTELS:

If you arrive at the airport
then take the S-Bahn no. 8 to Munich-City.

If you arrive at the central station
then take an arbitrary S-Bahn that goes into the direction of  
"Marienplatz-Ostbahnhof".

Then, in any case, proceed as follows:

To the conference building:

	Leave the S-Bahn at "Isartor";
	Change to tramway no. 17 (direction "Effnerplatz");
	Get out at "Tivolistrasse";
	Then the conference building (Oettingenstrasse 67) is
	on the other side of the street;
	Conference room = no. 114.
	Note: The conference building is known to many
	people in Munich as the previous "Radio Free Europe"
	building. This may be helpful if you have any trouble.

To guest houses Excelsior and Steinberg
and to Hotel Cosmopolitan:

	Leave the S-Bahn at "Marienplatz";
	Change to the underground no. U3 or no. U6
	(direction "M"unchner Freiheit");
	Get out at "Giselastrasse".

To Hotel Lettl:

	Leave the S-Bahn at "Marienplatz";
	Change to the underground no. U3 or U6
	(direction "M"unchner Freiheit");
	Get out at "Universit"at", exit "Schellingstrasse".

To Hotel Ariston:

	Leave the S-Bahn at "Isartor";
	Change to tramway no. 17 (direction "Effnerplatz");
	Get out at "Nationalmuseum/Haus der Kunst";

	(If you are arrived at the central station then it's better
	to choose directly the underground no. U4
	(direction "Arabellapark") or U5 (direction
	"Neuperlach S"ud"). Leave the underground at "Lehel".)

To M"unchen Park Hilton:

	It's the best to choose a Taxi at some place in Munich-City.
	Alternatively, you can first to go to the conference building
	and then walk to the hotel (5-10 min.).
