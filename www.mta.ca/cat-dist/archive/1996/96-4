               61st PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC

                Universite' du Littoral - Dunkerque - France

                      Saturday/Sunday, June 8/9, 1996


The 61st meeting of the PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC
will be held in Dunkerque over the week-end of 8-9 june 1996.
We wait for participants on Friday evening or Saturday morning.
Lectures will start at 9:45 a.m. As usual, there will be morning 
and afternoon sessions on Saturday and a morning session on Sunday.
Talks will be held in the University building, 1 quai de Freycinet,
at the 2nd floor.

REGISTRATION: there is a registration form attached to this message.
Please, if interested, return it by e.mail or by ordinary mail
to Enrico Vitale.

ACCOMODATION: we have reserved a small number of rooms at the hotel
"Maison des gens de mer", quai du Risban, tel. 28681522 (it is 
150 m. away from the University) at the cost of 192 F per night,
breakfast included. There are also some little more expensive hotels
near the beach. Keeping in mind that June is already a holiday month
for some people in France, we suggest to send us the registration 
form with the reservation (Friday/Saturday/Sunday nights) as soon as 
possible and not beyond May, 15th.

HOW TO REACH DUNKERQUE: 

BY CAR: motorways: A 1  from Paris
                   A 25 from Lille
                   A 16 from Calais (exit 33)
        from Brussels and Oostende: A 18 till you get Veurne (Furnes)
        then follow the direction Dunkerque to A 16 (exit 33)

BY TRAIN: TGV from Paris-Nord    on Friday   at 18:22 (arrival 19:55)
          TGV from Lille-Europe  on Friday   at 19:22 (arrival 19:55)
          TGV from Paris-Nord    on Saturday at  7:22 (arrival  9:23)
          from Brussels-Midi     at 17:22  (arrival at Lille-Europe 18:37)

Let us recall that for the TGV the formula Joker 30 (Joker 8) is very interesting, but you have to book at least 30 (resp. 8) days before departure.

BY BOAT: there is a ferry Ramsgate-Dunkerque (Sally Ferry) at 16:00,
         arrival 19:30, but with no easy connection to the city for those
         without a car.

HOW TO REACH THE UNIVERSITY: the University building is located in the 
centre of Dunkerque. It is easily recognizable with its metallic wing-shaped
roof and is commonly known as "la Citadelle". It is a 10-minute walk from
the railway station (take rue du Chemin de Fer, then rue des Fusilliers 
Marins and cross the water at the bridge Pont de Perthuis) or from the
Beffroy of the Cathedral (straight on leaving the Beffroy on your right-hand
and then croos the water at the bridge Pont de Perthuis). If you are 
interested, we will send you a map of Dunkerque by fax.


Please, circulate this announcement among your colleagues.

Dear categorists,
for my thesis I am interested in ccpo, effective F-spaces and recursion 
theory on some particular domain like cpo and "effective sets ". 
If you know any e-mail address of a group of people working in these 
 areas, please send it to me so that I can contact them; in particular I'm
also interested in some different formulation of recursive ( effective ) 
operator ( different e.g. from Rogers ).
Some address of paper available on FTP over these subjects are also needed.

I definitely appreciate the following answer to my mail by Jim Lambek
though I am afraid I wanted to make emphasise another aspect

I have been aware of this (standard) construction that can be found in most
textbooks on topos theory. 
One does not only have to extend the language by the subset types but ALSO
by constants for a lot of new morphism (where the domain or the codomain is
a new type).
The problem is not a mathematical one but a question of notational economy :
if I know that  a \in {a : A | P(a)}  and P(a) for a predicate P on A then I am
not allowed to conclude a \in A but only iota_{A,P}(a) 
provided I use the extension of the language formally.

For a precise formulation of the syntax of a language with subtypes see e.g.
top of page 134

W. Phoa  An Introduction to Fibrations, Topos Theory, the Effective ToposW. Phoa  An Introduction to Fibrations, Topos Theory, the Effective Topos
         and Modest Sets
         (Univ. Edinburgh LFCS Report, obtainable by ftp from the
          Imperial College server)

As I have said in my mail it is possible to give a syntax for subtypes BUT
when really working in the formal system it gets horribly clumsy to carry 
around all the inclusions all the time.
Formalised set theory avoids this (but surely has other defects I know).  

As long as one does not really work inside a formal system but only reasons
about a a formal system one never will notice these defects I guess.

From: F. W. Lawvere <mthfwl@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu>


  
  	A contrast has been pointed out :
                        working in a formal system  
  				"vs"
  		      reasoning about a formal system.
  Using both should lead in spiral fashion to both better formal systems
  and more knowledge about that which they describe. In this spirit we
  should surely expose the defects of a formal system rather than conceal 
  them. The formal system may need to be changed. It would be one-
  sided to only "work in " a system, accepting it as a divine condemnation  
  that we have to endure.
  	The objective necessity that every map has both a domain and a
  codomain  is one of the great principles of category theory. Already in the
  30s it was known to be required  by even the simplest functors such as
  pi-zero. Hence the answer to both of the questions  
  		Does topos logic correspond to type theory ?
  				"or"
  		Does topos logic correspond to set theory ?
  is NO.  Both were earlier, partially successful attempts to make explicit
  some "necessary laws of the development of thinking  in all the
  areas of mathematics". All areas of mathematics  lead to qualitative leaps
  like the functors of algebraic topology. For mathematics, freedom came 
  from the recognition of that necessity : the foundational role was thus 
  abandoned in practice by st which promoted the "freedom" allegedly 
  deriving  from ignoring codomains, while tt, though recognizing some 
  codomains 
  (as types ) , gets entangled in the "flexibility" of refusing to declare 
  variables,i.e. to specify domains.
  	A set in a topos is neither a type nor not a type : there are 
  sets of
  exactly the right size to be susceptible of being wired up as memory banks
  which serve  as power types or function types (or more specific 
  mathematically-oriented objects ) relative to some given sets, the wiring 
  being suitable maps which serve as evaluations, inclusions, etc.
  	A set in a topos is not a von Neumann "set" either; it has a 
  cohesiveness due to the incidence relations between its elements (right
  actions, pullbacks) so is a "Menge" not due to an excessive and 
  irrelevant structure but to a structure adapted to the mathematical 
  category of cohesiveness at hand. 
  	We carry the inclusions around only as long as we need them. Already
  Gauss pointed out that  when a subset (i.e. an inclusion map) arises, it may
  be very significant to study the domain in its own intrinsic self, but 
  this is
  difficult to make precise in st or tt.  Of course "subset" is not a 
  binary relation between sets but a given map, a mathematical necessity 
  that needs to be recognized by any truly flexible formalization in a way 
  coherent enough to work in. Given two inclusion maps b, c with the same  
  codomain A, it is
  clear what is a proof that "b is included in c" as subsets of A, and 
  given any
  element x of A (i.e. any map with codomain A), a proof that "x belongs to b"
  is formally the same kind of thing. Hence by composing proofs we can
  always conclude that x belongs to c,  independently of whether these
  subsets arose by equalizing some maps P with domain A.
  	Of course some improved version of tt is needed to handle the
  presentation of  cccs, but the basic issue of how to deal formally with
  inclusions and memberships  between subsets arising as equalizers arises 
  already with Lex. In general given any left adjoint, such as the one from 
  Cat to Lex or from Cat to CCC or the one from sets to monoids,etc, there 
  is an objective notion of presentation that arises. Formal systems are 
  subjective instruments for describing and clarifying such presentations.
  	It would seem that the idea of Burroni (described in Lambek &Scott)
  would lead to an effective formal system for presenting Lex over Cat.
  Naturally such formal systems would involve specifying both domains and 
  codomains. I believe that some of the implementations mentioned by 
  Rydeheard have these features, while others follow the less 
  efficient route
  of describing categories in some previously -programmed system of logic.
  	In the end it will surely be simpler, leading to greater freedom and
  fewer complications, to explicitly take the objectively necessary into
  account, rather than to  succumb to a naive belief in the "freedom" to 
  neglect some essential ingredient. There need not be an inevitable mismatch
  between useable formal systems and the mathematical structures they 
  strive to present.

SPECIAL SESSION AT THE TORONTO SPRING MEETING

The organizers of the Toronto Spring Meeting at York University have
decided to include a special session at the meeting on mathematical
education from the perspective of category theorists, specifically our
duty to teach category theory to the younger generation. Experiences and
suggestions on teaching category theory to computer science or math
students, whether beginning graduates, younger or more advanced
undergraduates, and as a course in itself or within a course on calculus
or topology or algebra or combinatorics are all encouraged. The session 
will be moderated by Bill Lawvere. 

This note is to provide a chance for participants to collect thoughts in
the short time before the meeting, and to invite contributions, either
before the meeting or later, from other members of the community.

People might be interested to know that towards the end of his life, Piaget
was trying to see how categroy theory might be used to help understand
children's thinking.  I think he was particularly interested in the move
from thinking about a category as a class of sets with certain permissible
functions between them, to the more axiomatic description in terms of
morphisms.  He wrote one book and at least one paper on the subject.

From: Ronnie BROWN <rbrown@mpce.mq.edu.au>


Tim Porter and I wrote an article for the general rerader `The 
methodology of mathematics' published 
in Math. Gazette July, 1995, in which we emphasise the question as to what 
are the objects of study of mathematics, what does it try to find out 
about these objects,  and what are the tools with 
which these objects are studied. These would seem likely to be  basic 
questions for the beginners in mathematics. 
 
The paper can be downloaded from 
http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/papers/methmatg.ps

Answers could be of the type:

Mathematics is the art and science of patterns and structures, and their 
growth and change. This is why mathematics underlies most of the 
other sciences, and gives a language for description, deduction and 
calculation with strange new objects which arise in everyday life, and in 
science, technology, and social sciences.

In order to study structures, you need a mathematics of structures, and 
in the current age this seems to be category theory, par excellence. 

The interesting question is how much can people who are used to maths as 
pluses and minuses actually appreciate of this. It is well worth trying 
to put it over, because if people do not have some feeling for these 
basic points, 
then the subject will be regarded with a mystique, and something not for 
them. 

Another advantage of this metalevel discussion is that it enables the 
possibility 
of some critique of category theory as practised. I am not trying to make 
this critique, but suggesting that we need a context in which discussion 
can take place, to allow an analysis of future directions! 

The point also is that we need an argument for mathematics (and in 
particular, for category theory), which can 
be put to the general public and to government. The current situation is 
that the applicable parts of maths are tapped off for the development of 
other subjects, where they can  often get notable funding, none of which 
goes to the source of these ideas. Indeed, they are no longer 
`mathematics'. How long can this source last, without proper support and 
nourishment, and an understanding of its achievements?

Topics covered will include the central problems and methods of finite
model theory, as well as applications in complexity theory, databases
and computer aided verification.

The detailed programme and a registration form are attached.

The cost of registration is 380 GBP.  A limited number of subsidised
places are available for postgraduate students at 340 GBP.  These will
be awarded on a first come first served basis, so early registration
is recommended.

Registration includes:
  - Accommodation for the nights of Sunday, 7 July and Monday, 8 July.
  - Reception on Sunday evening.
  - Breakfast and lunch on Monday and Tuesday, as well as dinner on
    Monday evening.
  - Coffee and Tea breaks.
  - A copy of all course materials.

Subject: Piaget 

Date: Sat, 13 Apr 1996 15:05:29 +0100
From: Alberto Peruzzi <peruzzi@dada.it>

The use made of categories by Piaget was unsatisfactory in many respects,
although it is an undoubtful merit to have recognised the relevance of
categories in dealing with the architecture of mathematical structures in
relationship with the cognitive development. The main defect was that also
in 1974 he didn't realise the role of adjoints: the lack of consideration
for adjoints prevented him from having a precise model of the growth in
structural complexity (as when he tried to explain the passage from a
monoid of "operations" to its "completion" into a group). This general
remark can be easily substantiated by those who know Piaget's theory of
cognitive stages. I argued for it already in a paper going back to 1978,
"unfortunately" written in Italian. (I can mail the paper, or some related
publications in English, to those who are interested.)

                 ANOTHER LOOK AT THE CHU CONSTRUCTION

                             2:30-3:30 PM
 
Abstract.  We take another look at the Chu construction and show how to
simplify it by looking at it as a module category in a trivial Chu
category.  This simplifies the construction substantially, especially in
the case of a non-symmetric biclosed monoidal category.  We also show
that if the original category is accessible, then for any of a large
class of ``polynomial-like'' functors, the category of coalgebras has
cofree objects.

                         University of Ottawa
                              4:15-5:15 PM
				
Abstract.  In this talk we discuss the notion of dinaturality and its
relationships to fundamental questions in algebra, semantics of programming 
languages, and logic. Exploring the dinatural "calculus" has been a consistent
(even if implicit) theme in many of Freyd's recent works, from coherence 
theorems in category theory, to work on fixed point recursion, to his most 
recent theory of "para-categories" and "para-mathematics" .  We survey  
this interesting concept from its inception in algebraic topology to its 
emergence in semantics of programming languages.  We end with various recent 
connections to proof theory and linear logic.

                             5:30-6:30 PM
          
Abstract.  We will discuss allegory-theoretic compilation, fibrational proof 
theory, and categorical semantics. We will look at how categorical perspectives
may be used to give a sufficiently general semantics to encompass many
extensions of logic programming, and to give some guidelines on how to design 
future extensions, and abstract machines. We will discuss some of the problems
involved in "liberating declarative programming from a given syntactic 
definition" and in capturing such notions as uniformily semantically.

Subject: FMCS-96 Workshop -- first announcement

	Foundational Methods in Computer Science:
	A workshop on applications of categories
		in computer science

		1996 June 1-2

	to be held on the campus of
	Washington State University
	Pullman WA 99164-2752
	USA


As always, the focus of this workshop is the applications of categories
to computer science, and to encourage cooperation on these matters
between computer scientists and mathematicians interested in this topic.
In previous sessions, some of the talks have been quite categorical
while others concentrate upon computer science matters which may excite
the interests of category theorists.

This workshop annual series strongly encourages the participation of
young researchers of every age.  As is the tradition in this workshop
series, there is a preceeding tutorial day on Friday, 1996 May 31.

Here is a list of possible areas, not meant to be in any sense
limiting, for those interested in contributing talks:
		Categorical and functional programming
          	Program specification and verification
		Duality
		Concurrency theory 
		Computer programs about categories
          	Pedagogy and foundational issues


This workshop is informal, even casual, but certain details need early
attention so that the workshop might go smoothly.  The cost will be as
modest as possible consistent with having an enjoyable and productive
workshop.  These costs are entirely for the purposes of proper digestion:
snacks during session breaks, a reception on Friday night and a workshop
dinner on Saturday night.

Please respond by return email with your positive intention as soon as
may be.  If you wish to contribute a talk, please email a tentative title.

Looking forward to seeing you at the end of May and the very beginning
of June,

Best,
David

----------------------TRANSPORTATION--------------------------------

Air -- via Spokane (GEG).   Airlines include United, Northwest,
Horizon, Alaska, Delta, Southwest.

Upon arrival, rent a car or else use Link Transporation limo,
which you may reserve also through your travel agent:
	(208) 882 1223
	(800) 359 4541
One way: $37.  Round trip: $52.
Be sure to reserve for your arrival.  Link will wait for late airplanes.
(For example, the last Link trip will wait for the last UA flight from
Chicago O'Hare)

Southbound
Leaves Spokane International Airport  8:00xs 12:05 2:30x 6:30  9:15x
Arrives Pullman                      10:00xs  1:50 4:10x 8:10 10:50x

Northbound
Leaves Pullman (WSU CUB)              5:00xs  8:15 10:15x 2:45 5:45x
Arrives Spokane Airport               6:45xs 10:00 12:00x 4:30 7:30x
	x -- not Saturdays
	s -- not Sundays


Horizon flys directly to Pullman from Seattle (SeaTac) and from Portland
and also Boise.  Fares from California, via Alaska Airlines, to Portland
or Seattle and thence on to Pullman are hardly more
than flying just to Portland or Seattle.  In the past this has been
true of Northwest flights from anywhere into SeaTac, but I forgot to
check whether or not this is still valid.  [Exactly one-half of the
Horizon flights from Seattle fly first into the Lewiston airport,
followed by the 10 minute hop to Pullman.  Try to book on the other
half, which go around the other way.  Reverse the half for departure
from Pullman.]
	You may rent a car at the Pullman airport, take a taxi, or
if at all possible, we will arrange to meet you at the airport.



For those planning to attend MFPS in Boulder, UA 302 departs
Spokane at 2:10pm on Sunday, June 2, arriving at 5:18pm at the United
concourse of the new DIA -- Denver International Airport.
I will be driving up to Spokane in ample time for this flight and will
be happy to take 1 or 2 more people up with me.  If there are more than
I can take, we can instead arrange for a special Link Transportation limo
to pick us up at the WSU CUB, near the conference room, to leave us
directly in front of the United ticket counters -- for a fee, of course.



By car -- If you are driving from Spokane, please let me know if you
would like information about scenic routes.  This is the best time
of year to go car touring in the channeled scablands, changing a 1.6
hour drive to Pullman into a 3.3 hour drive -- but well worth it!

If coming from another direction, similar car touring sidetrips can
be recommended.

In the near vicinity are the unusual Palouse Falls, the Drumheller
(Scabland) dry falls, the channeled scablands.  A bit further are
the Grand Coulee and its dam, as well as other coulees undeservedly
less well-known.  All of this unusual landscape is the result of the
(last) ice age Breitz Floods, about 40 of them each involving a Great
Lake's worth of water released within the space of a few days.  The
10 to 12 thousand years since the floods has done rather little
to erase the remarkable evidence of this catastrophe.

To the east are the mountains of Idaho.  This year you will be able
to access the high country via auto by the end of May.

All in all, if you have a bit of extra time, car touring in this
vicinity provides unsurpassed sights which are rather little known.

-------------RESTING-------------------------------------------------

There are motels and a city campground within walking distance of
restuarants, downtown, and the conference room.
I am attempting to arrange
the use of the University's conference dorm for this weekend.  The dorm,
if available, is quite lovely, and for a more modest price than
most of the motels.  An announcement regarding accommodations will be
sent to registering participants.

------------ENTERTAINMENT--------------------------------------------

Nothing can be more entertaining than Foundational Methods of Computer
Science, so we will have a reception on Friday night and a workshop
dinner on Saturday night.

-----------WHAT TO DO NOW---------------------------------------------

Send me a return email if you are planning to come.  Book your airflights
early, since the airplanes seem to be running rather full this year.

GETTING TO SALVADOR (BAHIA).
There are various regular flights from Europe and USA to Salvador's `4 de Julho
International Airport'.  The airport is located at some 30Km from the city
(out of inner city boundaries), and is under one hour by car to center of town.
Besides the Brazilian airlines VARIG and VASP, one European airline has at
least two direct flights to Salvador per week: TAP Air Portugal, from Lisbon.
If you get to Brazil via Rio, you will able to choose from various domestic
flights, some direct, from Rio to Salvador.  (This is not exactly high season,
but beginning of May is likely to be a fairly difficult time of the year to
find seats in domestic flights, so please be safe by booking in advance.)
There are five main domestic airlines in Brazil: VARIG, RIO-SUL, VASP,
TRANSBRASIL and TAM.

APPROXIMATE COST OF A TAXI RIDE FROM THE AIRPORT TO "SOL VITORIA MARINA HOTEL":
R$45.00 (forty five reals).

THE LOCATION.
Salvador, Capital of the Bahia state, the first European settlement of
Portuguese America and the first Capital of Brazil, is where all the most
important colonial buildings were constructed: churches, convents, palaces,
forts and many other monuments.  Part of the city historical center has been
safekept by UNESCO since 1985.  Five hundred years of blending Native American,
Portuguese, and African influences have left a rich culture to its people,
which can be felt on its music, food, and mysticism.  Salvador is located on
the northeastern coast of Brazil and the sun shines year round with the average
temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.  It is surrounded by palm trees and beaches
with warm water.  City population is around 2.5 million and life style is quite
relaxed.  It is generally agreed that Salvador is Brazil's tourism industry
best asset after Rio.  With the recent restauration of its historic center, a
visit to Salvador is a rather unique experience, not just for its natural
beauty but also because it is quite simply THE place to see the best of
Afro-Brazilian culture.

THE WEATHER.
Beginning of May in Salvador is usually fresh and rather windy (i.e. breezy,
since it is by the sea), with temperatures around 22-24 degrees Celsius.
Being the end of the rainy season an occasional shower may still fall during
the first weeks of May.  Usually, though, it is dry and a prelude to
pleasant June.

THE VENUE.
The 3rd WoLLIC'96 is part of a larger event being held in the "Ondina" Campus
of the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA).
The lectures will be at the Main Library ("Biblioteca Central") at
the Ondina Campus.

Date: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 08:20:18 -0300 (ADT)
Subject: Prof. Nobuo Yoneda passed away 

Date: Tue, 23 Apr 96 12:18:58 JST
From: KINOSHITA Yoshiki <yoshiki@etl.go.jp>


Prof. Nobuo Yoneda passed away at 12:21 on Sunday, 21 April, due to
heart failure.  He was attacked by acute pancreatitis in January and
had been in bed since then.  The funeral will take place at his house
at 12:00 on Wednesday, 24 April, in Shintoist style.

Very little is known about Prof. Yoneda in Euro-America-Australian
community.  So, I will try to write what I heard from Yoneda; there
might be some inaccuracy since I am relying on my memory.  Also, I
work in computer science and do not understand much of mathmatics.  I
would very much appreciate any corrections or supplements.

Prof. Yoneda was born on 28 March, 1930.  He studied mathematics in
the University of Tokyo; in the last year of his studies he followed
the seminar of Prof. Shokiti Iyanaga, where he became interested in
algebraic topology.  Soon after that (or maybe when he was still an
undergraduate), Prof. Samuel Eilenberg visited Japan, and Yoneda
traveled around Japan with him, as a translator and guide.  At that
time, he was exposed to the Cartan-Eilenberg book, which was still in
galley form.  Later, he got a Fulbright scholarship and he visited
Princeton, to study with Eilenberg.  Those days, the Yen was still
very weak, so even the Fulbright money was not enough to support even
a modest living in U.S.  Therefore, he worked as a proofreader at a
European publisher (Elsevier?  NorthHolland? maybe American), to earn
money for the study in U.S.  Even 25 years later, he seemed to be
proud of his professional skill as a proofreader, which he gained
then.

When he arrived in Princeton, Eilenberg had moved (sabbatical?) to
France (or maybe, Eilenberg left US just after Yoneda's arrival).  So,
Yoneda went to France a year later.  At that time, Saunders Mac Lane
was visiting category theorists, apparently to obtain information to
write his book (or former survey), and he met the young Yoneda, among
others.  The interview started in a Caf\'{e} at Gare du Nord, and went
on and on, and was continued even in Yoneda's train until its
departure.  The contents of this talk was later named by Mac Lane as
Yoneda lemma.  So, the famous Yoneda lemma was born in Gare du Nord.
This must have been a good memory for Yoneda; I heard him tell this
story many times.  I do not know whether Mac Lane managed to leave the
train before departure!

Yoneda's trip to America/Europe continued for two years.  When he came
back to Japan, his thesis advisor, Iyanaga, suggested him to begin
studying computers, which he did.  Some computer scientists know
Yoneda as a member of Algol68 committee.

Until 1976, Yoneda was a professor of the department of mathematics at
Gakushu-in University in Tokyo, and he took a professorship in 1977 at
the newly established department of information science at the
University of Tokyo, where he had 15 MSc. students (in Japan, MSc
students are research students, at least before 1990) and at least 5
DSc. (Doctor of Science, equivalent to Euro-American PhD) students,
three of which are DSc course students.  He retired from the
University of Tokyo in 1990, at the age of 60, as is custom there, and
moved to Tokyo Denki University, where he worked as a professor until
this March.

I do not know the phrase in English for this situation, so permit me
to write in Japanese: tutusinde Yoneda sensei no gomeihuku wo oinori
mousiagemasu.

Subject: Symmetric Monoidal Closed Categories 

Date: Wed, 24 Apr 1996 09:20:57 +0100
From: Chris Francis Townsend <cft@doc.ic.ac.uk>




I am just about to finish the writing up of my thesis and have 
one remaining difficulty. I needed to use the following result
about a symmetric monoidal closed categorie C,
`If C has coequalizers then so does the category CMon(C) of
commutative monoids over C'
I feel sure that this result is well known by anybody who
has worked with symmetric monoidal closed categories and so
have been frustrated by the fact that can't  find a 
reference for it. Does anybody know where I can find
such a reference for this result (or of some generalization
of it)?

Thanks


Chris Townsend

Date: Wed, 24 Apr 96 17:17 BST
From: Dr. P.T. Johnstone <P.T.Johnstone@pmms.cam.ac.uk>

In my "Topos Theory" book, you will *very nearly* find a proof
that, if C is symmetric monoidal closed, then the forgetful
functor CMon(C) --> C creates coequalizers of reflexive pairs.
(See Lemma 0.17 and Exercise 0.1; in the latter, the cartesian
products have to be replaced by tensor products, but that is
a triviality.) Given that all finite colimits can be constructed
from coproducts and reflexive coequalizers (and that CMon(C)
always has finite coproducts, for a different reason), that is
all you need.

	     International  Static  Analysis  Symposium	 (SAS'96)

		    Aachen, Germany, 24-26 September 1996


Static Analysis  is increasingly recognised  as a  fundamental tool  for  high
performance implementations and verification systems of high-level programming
languages.  The last two  decades  have witnessed substantial developments  in
this area, ranging from theoretical  frameworks to design, implementation, and
application of analysers in optimising compilers.
    The Third International Static Analysis Symposium, SAS'96, will be held in
Aachen in combination with the Fifth International Conference on Algebraic and
Logic  Programming   (ALP'96)	and the	 Eighth	  International	  Symposium on
Programming Languages, Implementations, Logics, and Programs (PLILP'96).
    The	 technical program   for  SAS'96  will consist	of   invited lectures,
presentations  of refereed papers,  and software demonstrations. Contributions
are welcome on all aspects of Static Analysis, including, but not limited to
				   
	     Abstract Interpretation	     Optimising Compilers
	     Complexity			     Theoretical Frameworks
	     Experimental Evaluation	     Verification Systems
	     Specific Analyses		     Type Inference
	     Partial Evaluation		     Abstract Domains

    Submissions can address  any  programming paradigm, including  concurrent,
constraint,      functional,     imperative,      logic and    object-oriented
programming. Survey papers that present some aspect of the above topics with a
new coherence are also welcome.
    Papers must  be written in  English, must  not exceed 15  pages (excluding
references   and figures),  and  must  contain  a  cover  page containing  the
following:  a 200-word  abstract,   keywords, postal  and  electronic  mailing
addresses, and phone numbers and fax numbers of one of the authors.
    Submissions should arrive at the  address below by  6  MAY  1996 in one of

The Theory of Hybrid Automata
  Thomas A. Henzinger (University of California at Berkeley)

Abstract: Hybrid automata, which combine discrete transition graphs with
continuous dynamical systems, are mathematical models for digital systems
that interact with analog environments. Hybrid automata can be viewed as
infinite-state transition systems, and this view gives insights into the
structure of hybrid state spaces. For example, for certain interesting
classes of hybrid automata, language equivalence, mutual similarity, or
bisimilarity induce finite quotients of infinite state spaces. These results
can be exploited by analysis techniques for finite-state systems.

TUTORIAL: 9:15-10:30. Chair: P. Panangaden.

Lattices, Categories and Communication
Andre Joyal (Universite du Quebec a Montreal)

Abstract: We describe a theory of communication based on free lattices
and free bicomplete categories. It is based on a game-theoretic
representation of bicomplete categories. All our results extend to
enriched categories. In (*) we associate a two player game to each
term representing an element of a free lattice. To a pair of terms we
associate a three player game, a mediator facing two opposites. A
strategy for the mediator is viewed as a communication strategy
between the opposites. A communication strategy is complete iff it is
winning. The mediator has a complete communication strategy iff the
corresponding terms can be compared in the free lattice.  Here we show
that the objects and arrows of free bicomplete categories have a
similar game-theoretic interpretation. Two communication strategies
are operationally equivalent iff they define the same arrow in the
free bicomplete category. Many connectives of linear logic have an
interpretation in free bicomplete categories. Our work suggests
similarities between the world of computing and that of financing.

			       LOCATION
			       ========


The conferences will be held at the College Avenue Campus of Rutgers
University in downtown New Brunswick, which is easily accessible by
air, train, and car. For air travel, New Brunswick is 35 minutes from
Newark International Airport, a major U.S. and international airline
hub. By rail, the New Brunswick train station is located less than
eight blocks from the conference site and is on Amtrak's Northeast
corridor. For travel by car, the conference site is approximately
three miles from Exit 9 of the New Jersey Turnpike.

A postscript map of the College Avenue Campus is available on the web
and at the FLoC ftp site (addresses at the beginning of this
announcement).  Conference check-in and on-site registration will take
place at the Main Lounge entrance on the second floor of the Rutgers
Student Center (#78 on map, follow signs for exact location). Evening
registration is possible the day before the beginning of FLoC, Friday,
26 July from 16:00-19:00. On regular conference days, the registration
desk will be open from 8:00-18:00; on Monday, 29 July and Tuesday, 30
July, registration hours will be extended to 19:00. Conference
sessions will take place in the Rutgers Student Center and Brower
Commons(#57 on map). CADE workshops will take place in Scott Hall(#21
on map).


Climate
-------

New Jersey in July and August is typically hot, with average daily
highs around 85 degrees F (29 degrees C), and overnight lows around 70
degrees F (21 degrees C). Most days are sunny, but also come prepared
for the possibility of occasional rain.


Things to do
------------

The newly opened Liberty Science Center is a fun, hands-on science museum
located in Liberty State Park, about 30-45 minutes from New Brunswick
(201-200-1000). From Liberty State Park, one can also take a ferry to the
Statue of Liberty and the Immigration Museum at Ellis Island.

New York City can be reached in under an hour by rail on New Jersey Transit.
Trains run about twice an hour during the week, and once an hour on weekends
and at night. Fare is $7.75 one-way, $11.50 round trip excursion.

The New Jersey shore is less than an hour from New Brunswick. Points along
the shore vary greatly in character. Some, such as Point Pleasant, have long
boardwalks with amusement park rides, video arcades, etc. Others, such as
Spring Lake, are quiet and uncommercialized with clean and very pretty
beaches. Further south, about two hours from New Brunswick, are the casinos
of Atlantic City.

You can walk for miles and miles along the towpath of the peaceful Delaware
and Raritan Canal which runs from New Brunswick south past Princeton.

Your registration packet will include a pass for access to the College
Avenue Gymnasium (near the dormitories,#77 on map).




			    SOCIAL EVENTS
			    =============


A reception will be held Friday, 26 July, 17:30-19:30.  A joint
banquet for LICS and RTA participants will be held on Monday, 29 July
at 19:00 at the Farrington Manor, a banquet site near New Brunswick.
Dana Scott will be giving a talk after dinner. The cost of the banquet
is $50 per person.




				TRAVEL
				======


Travel advisory: The 1996 Summer Olympics will take place in Atlanta
from 19 July to 3 August, 1996. Travel to the East Coast will be
especially heavy during these times. It is strongly recommended that
you make airline reservations as early as possible.

By air: Newark International Airport is by far the most convenient. A
taxi from the airport to New Brunswick costs about $40 (plus nominal
tolls) for up to four passengers. This is the flat-rate fare for a
licensed taxi from the official-looking taxi stand; it is strongly
recommended that you refuse rides offered by unlicensed taxi drivers
who may approach you elsewhere in the airport. If renting a car,
follow signs out of the airport to New Jersey Turnpike South, and
continue with the directions below. By public transportation, take the
Airlink bus ($4 exact fare, operates every 20 minutes) to Newark Penn
Station and follow the "by rail" directions below.  New Jersey Transit
train fare is $5.25 one-way or $8 round trip excursion; trains run
about twice an hour during the week, and less often in the evening and
on weekends.

For those arriving at JFK International Airport, there is a shuttle
bus operated by Princeton Airporter (phone 800-468-6696). The shuttle
stops at Newark Airport (fare $19; follow the above directions) and
the East Brunswick Hilton (fare $29; approximately a $7 cab ride to
the conference site). The shuttle leaves JFK at 9:00, 11:00, 13:00,
14:00, 15:00, 16:00, 17:00, 18:00, 19:00, 20:00, 21:00, 22:00. Advance
reservations are not possible. For information and reservation contact
the ground tranportation center on the baggage level. A taxi from JFK
to New Brunswick costs approximately $120 for up to four
passengers. Driving from JFK to New Brunswick may take up to two
hours, and is not recommended if you are not familiar with the area.

By car: Take the New Jersey Turnpike (south from Newark or New York,
north from Philadelphia) to Exit 9. Follow signs onto Route 18 North
or West (labeled differently at different spots) toward New
Brunswick. Take the Route 27, Princeton exit onto Albany Street (Route
27) into downtown New Brunswick. The Hyatt Regency Hotel will be on
your left after the first light. If staying at the Hyatt, turn left at
the next light, Neilson Street, and left again into the front entrance
of the hotel. If staying in the dorms, continue past this light to the
following light, George Street, and turn right. Stay on George Street
to just before the fifth street and turn left into the Parking
Deck(#55 on map). If staying in the dorms, go directly to the
appropriate dormitory. It is a short walk to Hardenbergh (#49 on map)
or Stonier (#56 on map). Parking passes will be provided to all
conference registrants who need one.

By rail: Take either an Amtrak or a New Jersey Transit train to the
New Brunswick train station. This is located at the corner of Albany
Street and Easton Avenue. If staying at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, it is
a three block walk to the left on Albany Street to the hotel. If
staying in the dorms, go directly to the appropriate dormitory. It is
about a six block walk to Hardenbergh (#49 on map) or Stonier (#56 on
map). There is also a taxi stand in front of the train station on
Albany Street.




			    ACCOMMODATIONS
			    ==============


We have established the group rate of $89/night for one single,
double, triple, or quadruple room at the Hyatt Regency Hotel (about
eight blocks from the conference site). This rate is only guaranteed
through 28 June 1996, and, due to limited availability, it is strongly
recommended that you make reservations as soon as possible.

We have reserved dormitory space in two dorms, both of which are an
easy walk to the main conference site. Dorm reservations must be made
by the early registration deadline of 21 June 1996. Both dorms include
daily maid service (linens provided first day for the week and daily
fresh towels and beds made), and are fully air-conditioned. The
Stonier Hall dorms (#56 on map (uncompressed)) have suites with one
shared bedroom and one shared bathroom. Only a block away, the
Hardenbergh Hall dorms (#49) have single rooms with baths shared on
each floor. If you elect Stonier Hall and do not specify a roommate, a
roommate of the same sex may be assigned to your suite.

Please specify your dorm preference on your registration form; we will
assign space accordingly on a first come, first served basis as long
as rooms are available. Unfortunately, because there are only a finite
number of rooms within each dormitory, we can neither guarantee your
choice of dormitory nor your preference of dates.

Note that the accomodations include breakfasts and some dinners (on
those nights that do not have banquets). Sorry, but we cannot give
rates on rooms without meals, or on rooms on different dates other
than those listed below.

Reservations

For details on prices and reserving, see the
registration/accommodation forms. These are available in postscript
on the web and via ftp.

                        ON-CAMPUS HOUSING FORM
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have reserved dormitory space in two dorms, both of which are an
easy walk to the main conference site.  Dorm reservations must be made
by the early registration deadline of 21 June 1996.  Both dorms
include daily maid service (linens provided first day for the week and
daily fresh towels and beds made), and are fully air-conditioned.  The
Stonier Hall dorms (#56 on map) have suites with one shared bedroom
and one shared bathroom.  Only a block away, the Hardenbergh Hall
dorms (#49) have single rooms with baths shared on each floor.  If you
elect Stonier Hall and do not specify a roommate, a roommate of the
same sex may be assigned to your suite.

Please specify your dorm preference on your registration form; we will
assign space accordingly on a first come, first served basis as long
as rooms are available.  Unfortunately, because there are only a
finite number of rooms within each dormitory, we can neither guarantee
your choice of dormitory nor your preference of dates.  Check-in will
take place at each dormitory.  Check-in hours will be 14:00-22:00 on
26 July and 16:00-22:00 on 29-30 July.

Note that the accomodations include breakfasts and some dinners (on
those nights that do not have banquets).  Sorry, but we cannot give
rates on rooms without meals, or on rooms on different dates other
than those listed below.

All fees are in U.S. Currency.  Please circle the applicable fee.
Payment due with registration.  Please include this form with your
payment.

From: Luis Soares Barbosa <lsb@di.uminho.pt>

This is probably a trivial question, but I would appreciate
any pointer to a solution:

Let A be a denumerable set and A* be the set of finite sequences of A.
It is easy to show (by defining two injections) that the set (A* x A*) is 
isomorphic (as a set) to (A x 2)* -- where 2 is a two element set and x
the Cartesian product.  The question is how to exhibit the isomorphism 
(actually the 2 obvious injections are not mutually inverse).

Thanks.
L. S. Barbosa

Date: Tue, 30 Apr 1996 23:25:52 +0200 (MET DST)
From: koslowj@iti.cs.tu-bs.de

Concerning Luis Soares Barbosa's question about the isomorphism in set
of A^* x A^* and (A x 2)^* for countable A:

Just because two sets are countable doesn't mean there has to exist
a *canonical* isomorphism.  The only canonical function in this setting
is induced by the monoid structure:  A x 2 in set is (canonically!)
isomorphic to A + A (where + means coproduct, i.e., disjoint union in
set).  The free monoid functor (-)^* is left adjoint and hence
preserves coproducts, i.e., (A + A)^* =~ A^* + A^* in mon, the category
of monoids (where the coproduct is *not* given by disjoint union).
Now the two projections from A^* x A^* to A^* in mon have left inverses
(pairing with the empty sequence), hence the universal property of the
coproduct induces a canonical monoid-homomorphism from A^* + A^* to
A^* x A^*.  Incidentally, the two "injections" from A^* to A^* + A^*
both have right inverses in mon, hence the universal property of the
product induces a canonical monoid-homomorphism from A^* + A^* to
A^* x A^*, which coincides with the first one!  Although defined by
"general abstract nonsense", this homomorphism is easily understood:
it decomposes sequences of red and blue elements of A into the red and
the blue subsequence.  Clearly, this is not injective.  We might say
that "morally", A^* + A^* is larger than A^* x A^*.  That for countable
A the underlying sets have the same size is just an accident.
