On 29 June 1997, I announced on "categories" my "Euclidean principle"
	f(a) & a = f(true) & a
which holds for any support classifier or dominance Sigma (ie subobject
classifier as in an elementary topos, but for any class of monos, eg open
or RE subsets), where a:X->Sigma and f:X x Sigma -> Sigma.  I gave a 
talk about this at the Category Theory meeting in Vancouver that year.

At the Category Theory meeting in Tours in 1994 I talked about taking
Par\'e's theorem (that the contravariant powerset functor in a topos,
which is self-adjoint, is monadic) as an axiom.  Another category with
this property is the category of locally compact locales, where Sigma is
the Sierpinski space and "powerset" means "lattice of open sets", equipped
with the Scott topology.

This is a way of re-axiomatising general topology without the arbitrary
unions in the traditional definition and in locale theory: the category
of "frames" is to be both dual to the category of "spaces" and algebraic
over it.

I have now written up these ideas as a draft paper entitled
    "An Abstract Stone Duality, I: Geometric and Higher Order Logic"
that you can get via my page in the Hypatia Electronic Library, which is
	http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/author/TaylorP
(I sent copies of an earlier draft to a number of people in November 1998,
but otherwise this is new text: it is not the same as any "notes on SDT"
that you may have got from me over the web in the past.)

After some discussion relating the monadic property to sobriety of spaces
and spatiality of locales, I prove the converse of the basic observation
about the Euclidean principle: if Sigma satisfies it and the adjunction
is monadic then Sigma is the classifier for some class of monos.

It is neither an axiom nor a theorem that the category has all finite limits.
Indeed, the point is that equalisers etc depend on a notion of equality,
which, from a computational point of view, is not as straightforward as
pure mathematicians have traditionally considered it to be.  Some spaces
(datatypes) admit equality in a "positive" way: for example in a group
given by generators and relations, or in a lambda calculus with reduction
rules, we may hope to prove equality of two terms, but not inequality.
On the other hand, we may hope to prove inequality of real numbers but
not equality.  These ideas are formalised by notions of "discrete" and
"Hausdorff" spaces respectively, along with definitions of "open" and
"compact".

We show that the full subcategory of open discrete spaces is a pretopos,
the same being true of the compact Hausdorff spaces, by showing that the
coequaliser is Sigma-split.

The point of Sigma-split co/equalisers is that, being equationally defined,
we might hope to be able to compute with them, possibly using something
like the "continuation-passing style" used in some compilers.

The Euclidean principle and monadicity property are related, respectively,
to the Phoa principle and repleteness in sythetic domain theory.  In that
subject we also need an infinitary axiom that makes all functions Scott
continuous and provides fixed points; this axiom is *not* discussed in
the present paper, largely because this seemed an appropriate criterion
to use to divide up a rambling collection of notes into papers.  The
infinitary axiom and the construction of the "lift" will be considered 
in Part II.

Under the infinitary axiom, open discrete spaces form an arithmetic universe,
ie they admit N-indexed colimits and free algebras, whilst compact Hausdorff
space admit limits and cofree coalgebras.

You might like to consider this paper alongside the recent work of Alex
Simpson and Jaap van Oosten on Synthetic Domain Theory,
	http://www.math.uu.nl/publications/preprints/1080.ps.gz
which is very much concerned with the infinitary axiom.  In particular
Alex is keen to emphasise the additional completeness of the ambient
category that is needed to construct infinitary co/limits and solutions
of domain equations, by comparison with directed joins and fixed points
of functions.  He considers that some attention to the axiom of replacement
is needed here, and I agree with him, though our treatments are different.

My paper is written for a general mathematical audience, and argues its
point of view from a position of extreme Cartesisn doubt.  I feel that
Alex and Jaap's work is very arcane by comparison, as it depends heavily
on Hyland's effective topos.

For my own views on replacement, see the final section of my book,
	Practical Foundations of Mathematics.
I hope to be able to make an announcement about the availability of 
this very soon.

This is a reaction to Paul Taylor's advertisement for his paper
on Abstract Stone Duality.

Paul has considered appropriate to mention the paper "Axioms and
(Counter)examples in Synthetic Domain Theory" by Alex Simpson and
myself, and to polemicize against it in the following way:

Thanks, Paul, for mentioning our paper, but since the above text is a
blatant misrepresentation of its content, a correction is in order.
Our paper develops the theory on the basis of 4 axioms, of which one
(the \neg\neg-separatedness of \Sigma) is rather special, as we explicitly
acknowledge. Otherwise the treatment is completely general, and "completeness
of the ambient category" nowhere enters the picture (we do have, however,
some treatment of whether the lift functor preserves internal colimits of
chains). The remark about Replacement refers to other work by Alex. 

The axiomatic treatment raises independence questions, some of which we solve
by considering models. One of these models is the effective topos. Nowhere
do we hint that the effective topos should have a privileged place among
models.

Anyway, it is funny that our work, which builds on the tradition of turning
SDT into an axiomatic theory (a process which I think is still unfinished),
tradition which was started by Pino Rosolini, Wesley Phoa, Martin Hyland and
Paul himself, is now found to be "arcane" (mind you, the whole subject is
less than twenty years old) by Paul.

    Lambda Definability with Sums via Grothendieck Logical Relations

                 by Marcelo Fiore and Alex Simpson

    We introduce a notion of *Grothendieck logical relation* and use 
    it to characterise the definability of morphisms in *stable* bicartesian
    closed categories by terms of the simply-typed lambda calculus with 
    finite products and finite sums. Our techniques are based on concepts 
    from topos theory, however our exposition is elementary.


The paper is written in a style appropriate for the conference

    Typed Lambda-Calculi and Applications

where it is to be presented in April. However, we briefly discuss
the true categorical content of the paper, which will be further 
expanded upon in a full version of the paper (forthcoming).

The paper is available over the Web:

As Jaap van Oosten says, I considered appropriate to mention the paper
"Axioms and (Counter)examples in Synthetic Domain Theory" by Alex Simpson
and himself when I announced my own draft paper "An Absract Stone Duality".

There are two reasons why I did consider this appropriate:
(1) they and I both use the heading "synthetic domain theory" for our
    work, and I feel that their work is important and should be considered
    alongside mine;
(2) people outside a particular discipline tend to go by the labels -
    "guilt by association" - so I was keen that those who had already
    looked at Jaap & Alex's paper (after they advertised it on "categories"
    before the holiday) should not assume that mine would be of the same kind.

I did not "polemicize" against it.  I said that I felt it was "arcane",
but wanted to say something positive about it first. Unfortunately, as
Alex has pointed out to me, I got the paper confused with our discussions
when I visited Edinburgh shortly before Jaap's announcement.

Jaap says that
> it is funny that our work, which builds on the tradition of turning

> tradition which was started by Pino Rosolini, Wesley Phoa, Martin Hyland and

As a generality, and without wishing to take this argument any further,
surely a *founder* of a theory is qualified to describe a subsequent 
development of it as "arcane", ie accessible only to particular specialists,
and not what that founder had in mind?  SDT is a minority research topic,
still the plaything of a group of friends - that's what I like about it.
It's not Tony Blair's New Labour Party - we *are* allowed to disagree!

Anyway, since this particular beast has now been awoken from its slumbers,
I want to try to explain the mathematical content of this disagreement
briefly for a general audience.

Probably most "categories" readers have now heard the slogan,
	"Domains are sets - all functions are computable"
cf	"Manifolds are sets - all functions are smooth".
Synthetic domain theory and synthetic differential geometry are then about
(1) postulating conditions on the ambient topos (category of "sets")
(2) selecting from those "sets" those that are to be called "domains" or
    "manifolds" and
(3) using these ideas to prove interesting theorems or compute programs.

Much of the progress and disagreement in SDT has been about part (2).

Wesley Phoa, in his 1990 Cambridge thesis under Martin Hyland's supervision,
was the first to describe objects in a certain topos that looked like the
"domains" in theoretical computer science, rather than like lattices in
pure mathematics. (I *don't* mean to polemicize against Pino Rosolini there.)
Wes defined a certain preorder on each object of the topos, and restricted
to those objects for which this is a poset (antisymmetric), and further
to those for which it has directed joins, a least element and therefore
fixed points.

In particular, Wes selected his domains by testing each one for the relevant
infinitary condition.

My idea, in my 1991 LiCS paper, was that the infinitary condition could be
imposed on a *single* object, and the domains selected be means of a more
finitary categorical notion called "repleteness" that Martin Hyland had
introduced in his paper in the 1990 Como Category Theory proceedings.

Alex Simpson, John Longley and Jaap van Oosten later came up with another
infinitary condition, "well-completeness", and they, like Wes, select their
domains by testing this for each domain.  Under suitable conditions, this
gives a larger full subcategory than mine.

I do not dare even to give you the definition of well-completeness, let
alone attempt to defend or attack it.  You should read Alex and Jaap's
paper for that.

One of the objections to repleteness is that it is very difficult to 
characterise in familiar models.  Pino Rosolini has (with others)
investigated this, and you can find some of his results in the papers 
listed on his Hypatia page,
	http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/author/RosoliniG

(By the way, Hypatia now has a new server and some new code.  The machine
on which it was living from May to December 1998 was forever crashing,
partly because the mirrored papers were stored on a large collection of 
very old disks with a SCSI chain that made visitors to our machine room 
gasp in horror.)

My paper is, in this context, a defence of the notion of repleteness.
Since "attack is the best form of defence" it does this by replacing it
with a stronger notion, namely that a certain adjunction be monadic.
This has the effect of replacing the "domains" defined by ordered structures
that have been in use in theoretical computer science since the early 1970s
by locally compact locales.

Yes. Im my paper
"Homotopy coherent category theory and A_{\infty}-structures in monoidal
categories" JPAA, 123 (1988), 67-103, theorems 2.3, 2.4 and corollary
2.3.1.. 

In this paper I define A_{\infty}-categories as algebras in the category
of K-graphs over A_{\infty}-K-operads, where K is a simplicial monoidal
category with Quillen model structure such that tensor commutes 
with simplicial realization functor. I show that every locally fibrant
A_{\infty}-category (i.e. Hom(a,b) is fibrant object in K for every a
and b) is equivalent in some homotopy coherent sense to a honest
K-category.

It seems that a reference for this result is a paper of Dwyer-Kan-Smith:

W. Dwyer, D. Kan, J. Smith. Homotopy commutative diagrams and their
realizations. JPAA 57 (1989), 5-24.

This is prior to Batanin's paper (NB there is a typographical error in
Batanin's message---the year of his paper is 1998 not 1988!).

I found D-K-S in my bibliographic wanderings this fall. In the last section
of their paper, they define the notion of ``Segal category'' and at the
same time prove that any Segal category is equivalent to a strict
simplicial category.
The terminology ``Segal category'' is my own (D-K-S don't give this notion
a name). The notion of ``Segal category'' is the Segal-delooping-machine
equivalent of the notion of A_{\infty}-category.

In our preprint of this summer (math.AG/9807049), A. Hirschowitz and I give
a sketch of proof of the strictification result of D-K-S. We were not aware
at the time of D-K-S, nor of Batanin's paper which also gives a proof and
which treats a more general situation too. (I found out about Batanin's
paper this fall thanks to the previous flurry of messages on ``categories''
occasionned by a question from Jim!)

I don't claim to have actually understood DKS's proof because it is very
short and in very abstract language; however, given that (1) all proofs of
this type of strictification result are basically the same; and (2) D-K-S
have a good
track record; there doesn't seem to be any doubt that the proof is indeed
contained in their paper.

The definition of ``Segal category'' in D-K-S is of course much prior to any
of my own versions of this definition. It also seems to be (as far as I know)
the first occurrence of the notion of A_{\infty}-category.

In this context one should point out that Jim's original notion plus all of
the subsequent delooping-machine variants, are just A_{\infty}-categories
with one object; and going to the case of several objects is a rather
obvious embellishment, so discussing ``priority'' for this notion would
seem to be arcane indeed!

Hello,

can someone give me references for the following two constructions?

- in a closed monoidal category, the multiplication on the inner hom is
normally defined as the transpose of 

B tens (B -o B) tens (B -o B) ---> B tens (B -o B) ---> B

where tens is the tensor product, -o the inner hom, the first map ev tens
(B-o B) and the second ev.

- A,B,C objects in a monoidal category and A is a monoid. 
If B is an A-right-module in the sense that there is a morphism 
f: B tens A ---> B which satisfies certain axioms and C is a
A-left-module g:A tens C ---> C, then the quotient B tens_A C can be
defined as the coequalizer of the two
maps 
B tens g: B tens A tens C ---> B tens C   
and 
f tens C: B tens A tens C ---> B tens C

Thanks,

HEADLINE: AP Journalists Shot in Sierra Leone

DATELINE: FREETOWN, Sierra Leone

   BODY:
   A television producer for The Associated Press was killed and an AP
bureau chief was seriously wounded when their car was hit by gunfire
while covering the civil war in Sierra Leone.

   Myles Tierney, a Kenya-based producer for Associated Press
Television News, and Ian Stewart, based in Ivory Coast, were among
journalists and government Information Ministry officials who were
traveling Sunday in four cars through embattled downtown Freetown.

   They were being escorted by troops of a West African coalition
force, known as ECOMOG, which is protecting the elected government.

   According to other journalists in the group, the AP journalists
were in a station wagon that was approached by an armed man on the
street in downtown Freetown. The man opened fire on the car with a
semiautomatic rifle after an exchange of words with an ECOMOG soldier
also riding in the car.

   Tierney, 34, of New York City, was shot and died instantly.
Stewart, 32, suffered a head wound. AP photographer David Guttenfelder
of Waukee, Iowa, was also in the car and suffered cuts from broken
window glass.

   The journalists were rushed to a nearby ECOMOG base, and then flown
to Conakry, Guinea. Stewart and Guttenfelder were transported from
there to Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

   ''We are devastated by the news of Myles' death and Ian's serious
injuries,'' said Thomas Kent, international editor of The Associated
Press. ''It is another bitter example of the sacrifices made by
correspondents who go in harm's way to cover the news.''

   Nigel Baker, head of news at Associated Press Television News,
said: ''The death of Myles Tierney has robbed international television
of one of its brightest young stars. He was a consummate professional,
highly talented and highly resourceful.''

   Freetown has been carved into neighborhoods of rebel and loyalist
control. The rebel Revolutionary United Front controls most of eastern
Freetown and parts of the downtown, and has rejected calls for a
cease-fire. Sporadic shelling had been heard overnight, but
street-to-street fighting had tapered off Sunday morning.

   State-controlled radio warned all civilians to stay indoors, saying
loyalist troops were patrolling the streets in search of rebel
fighters who have been using residents as human shields.

   Tierney joined AP as a freelance producer for the agency's TV
division in Africa during 1996, organizing coverage of a military coup
in Burundi. Later that year he joined the staff and set up the
agency's first TV bureau in New York.

   In January 1997, he shifted to Africa, based in Nairobi. For the
next two years he chronicled the turmoil across east and west Africa.
He was part of an AP team that for three months reported exclusively
on the advance of then rebel leader Laurent Kabila in eastern Zaire,
now Congo.

   During the assignment, he pioneered use of new technology which
allowed video to be dispatched over a conventional satellite
telephone. It meant the TV coverage was ahead of all opposition.

   He also had covered conflicts in Rwanda, Guinea-Bissau, Eritrea and
Somalia.

   ''On top of his professional skills he was renowned among
colleagues and competitors for his great good humor and generosity of
spirit,'' Baker said.

   Stewart is AP's West Africa bureau chief, based in Abidjan. He
began working for AP in Pakistan, moved on to Hanoi in 1996 and began
his present assignment last year. A Toronto native, he graduated from
Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, and has a master's degree
from Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.

 Slain, Wounded Journalists Praised

   They came from all over one continent - from New York City, from
Ontario, from Iowa - to cover a war in the corner of another, to tell
the world about a place that few had heard of and even fewer had ever
considered visiting.

   Myles Tierney, Ian Stewart and David Guttenfelder, journalists for
The Associated Press in Africa, brought a long list of reporting credits
- and risks - to their assignment in the chaotic West African nation of
Sierra Leone.

   But on a hot, sunny Sunday, the dizzying unpredictability so familiar
to those who have covered Africa caught up with them for several
seconds.

   Tierney, 34, from New York City, a Kenya-based producer for
Associated Press Television News who one colleague said "lived his life
like it was the 100-yard dash," was killed instantly when a rebel
soldier peppered the AP vehicle with gunfire.

   Stewart, 32, from Toronto, known for chasing one story and coming
back with many more, was seriously wounded in the head. Guttenfelder,
29, of Waukee, Iowa, one of the AP's most intrepid photographers, was
cut by flying glass and was the only one of the three who escaped
serious injury.

   "They just wanted to kill someone. Maybe we were the closest to
them," Guttenfelder said Monday from his home base, the AP's West Africa
bureau in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

   Stewart, the West Africa chief of bureau, was airlifted Monday to
London, where he was to undergo surgery for a bullet in the brain. He
was in stable condition Monday night.

   AP President Louis D. Boccardi praised Tierney as "a brave and
adventurous man" and mourned the attack. "We are in awe of the
sacrifices they and others make so we can carry out our mission,"
Boccardi said Monday.

   "Africa was the opportunity in his life to realize himself," said
Tierney's mother, Hanne. "And he did. This was where all of his talents
really came to the fore."

   Guttenfelder recounted a surreal day that began at a hotel outside
downtown Freetown, the unstable capital, with the AP journalists and
their colleagues from other organizations trying to obtain firsthand
information about the situation in the city.

   They'd tried to move around Saturday but couldn't because of the
warfare on the streets. Sunday seemed less tense, Guttenfelder said.

   On the street they came upon Julius Spencer, Sierra Leone's minister
of communications, who offered to escort them into town. With him were
soldiers from ECOMOG, the West African regional peacekeeping force.

   "He said ... it was a matter of mopping up," Guttenfelder said. "He
wanted to show us - and us to show the world - that they were very much
in control."

   The journalists were skeptical, but they saw subtle signs of
improvement: troops moving freely, gasoline stations reopening.

   As they neared downtown, and part of the convoy headed down to take a
look at the city's center, shots reverberated in the distance. Down a
hill they went, past the soccer stadium, past hulks of blown-up cars,
past fallen traffic lights, past shuttered buildings, past corpses set
upon by vultures.

   Then, around a corner, they encountered five armed men in American-
style jeans and flipflops. One, Guttenfelder remembered, "was wearing
a black bowler hat - like in `A Clockwork Orange."' No one was sure:
Were they rebels or looters?

   "They looked kind of charged up, maybe drugged up. They were smiling,
kind of laughing, acting like everything was cool," Guttenfelder said.
"I felt immediately they were different. ... (But) it seemed impossible
that a rebel would get that close."

   Then, in seconds: An ECOMOG soldier spoke to the men in a Nigerian
tongue; one responded in another dialect. And things fell apart. One
armed man fired a burst of shots into the AP car - a brazen act, given
the ECOMOG firepower surrounding him..

   "I get the feeling that he knew they were going to be killed, and
they didn't care," Guttenfelder said.

   Tierney died instantly. Stewart went down moaning.

   "I just felt this blast of heat and glass," Guttenfelder said. "I
immediately put my head down and I heard shooting for a couple of
seconds. ... Myles was obviously dead. ... I grabbed Ian and drug him
down into the car, then got out of the car into the street.

   ECOMOG soldiers fired back, killing the shooter and another rebel.
The driver took off with Stewart and Tierney to the ECOMOG staging area
in western Freetown. Guttenfelder was left behind. He shot a few
pictures, then hurried to the base to help arrange an airlift for
Stewart and for Tierney's body.

   Though he was a cameraman, Tierney's byline appeared on a range of
stories from Africa. He joined AP's TV arm in 1996, organizing coverage
of a military coup in Burundi. He set up the agency's first TV bureau in
New York before returning to Africa in 1997.

   Tierney is survived by his mother and a sister, Loren, both of New
York City. The family planned a private funeral; the AP was arranging a
memorial service.

   The AP has withdrawn all foreign journalists from Sierra Leone for
now.

   Tierney is the 24th AP journalist to die in the line of duty in the
organization's 150-year history. On Monday, at AP headquarters in New
York City, his picture was posted in memoriam. In it, he appears dressed
for action. Atop his head is an AP hat.

   And he is smiling.

In a recent paper (TAC, Vol 4, 208-248)

On Generic Separable Objects, by Robbie Gates,

the author mentioned a well known "boolean algebraic structure of the
summands of an object in an extensive category". This reminded me a
paper I posted to my homepage last year (8/30/98, see the abstract
below), in which the same boolean structure was reconstructed (at that
time this was not "well known" to me), and was applied to define the
Pierce topology for any extensive category, extending some results of
Diers. The paper

                Pierce Topologies of Extensive Categories

(The new service is a little bit slow, but offers more functions than
the old one, so please be patient.)

Pierce Topologies of Extensive Categories

by Zhaohua Luo

Abstraction

An extensive category is a category with finite stable disjoint sums. In
this note we show that each extensive category carries a natural
subcanonical coherent Grothendieck topology defined by injections of
sums. This Grothendieck topology is induced by a strict metric topology,
which is a functor to the category of  Stone spaces. We call this metric
topology the Pierce topology of the category, as it generalizes the
classical Pierce spectrums of commutative rings. Recall that the Pierce
spectrum of a commutative ring R is the spectrum of the Boolean algebra
of idempotents of R, which is a Stone space. A theorem of R. S. Pierce
states that R can be represented as the ring of global sections of a
sheaf of commutative rings on its Pierce spectrum (called the Pierce
sheaf or representation), whose stalks are indecomposable rings (with
respect to product decomposations). Diers showed that Pierce's theorem
can be extended to any object in a locally finitely presentable category
such that the opposite of the subcategory of finitely presentable
objects is lextensive (called a locally indecomposable category). We
shall see that a weak form of Pierce representation exists for any
object in an extensive category.

LEICESTER UNIVERSITY

DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE

LECTURESHIPS (GRADE A/B) IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (2 POSTS)

Applications are invited for 2 permanent Lectureships in Computer Science
in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of
Leicester.  There is no restriction regarding the area of research and
applicants with expertise in any area of Computer Science are welcomed.
Both lectureships are tenable from 1 April 1999 or as soon as possible
thereafter.

The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is divided into three
groups: Computer Science, Pure Mathematics and Applicable Mathematics.  The
lectureships are intended to strengthen the Computer Science Group with
regard to both teaching and research.  The Computer Science Group is firmly
research oriented and current activities are concentrated within three
research areas: Logic, Algebra and Complexity; Theory of Distributed
Systems; and Semantics.

The successful applicants will be ambitious, able to develop their own
research within a multi-faceted environment, and have a strong research
record and potential.  The new lecturers will be required to teach at
undergraduate and postgraduate level, and to perform administrative duties
as directed by the Head of Department.  This is a superb opportunity for
persons of energy, drive and ambition to assume rewarding roles and to
establish themselves in a young, dynamic and rapidly developing department.
Initial salary, dependent upon qualifications and experience, will be on
the Lecturer Grade A or B scale UK pounds 16,655 to UK pounds 29,048 p.a.

Candidates who are interested in the lectureships are invited, if they so
wish, to contact Professor Iain Stewart, Head of Computer Science and Head
of Department (telephone (+44) 116 252 3885, e-mail
i.a.stewart@mcs.le.ac.uk) or Professor Rick Thomas, Deputy Head of
Department (telephone (+44) 116 252 3411, email r.thomas@mcs.le.ac.uk), who
will be pleased to discuss the Lectureships further.  Information about all
aspects of the Department is available from its World Wide Web pages
[http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk].

Further particulars (which are also available on the World Wide Web) and
application forms are available from the Personnel Office (Academic
Appointments), University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH,
telephone (+44) 116 252 2758.

The closing date for applications is 19 February 1999.

          Computational Adequacy in an Elementary Topos

  We place simple axioms on an elementary topos which suffice for it to 
  provide a denotational model of call-by-value PCF with sum and product
  types. The model is synthetic in the sense that types are interpreted
  by their set-theoretic counterparts within the topos. The main result
  characterises when the model is computationally adequate with respect
  to the operational semantics of the programming language. We prove that
  computational adequacy holds if and only if the topos is $1$-consistent
  (i.e. its internal logic validates only true $\Sigma^0_1$-sentences).

This paper is to appear in the forthcoming proceedings of CSL 98.

It is available from:

Dear Colleagues,

  A referee attributed the notion of "dualizing object" in the context
  of *-autonomous to Grothendieck, but wasn't sure of the exact 
  reference.  Does somebody out there happen to know, where this was
  introduced first?

  Thank you very much.

hi.

there is probably a bit of duality in Grothendieck's TVS book. perhaps
there is more in one of his functional analysis papers from the 50es, all
referenced in the book.

an even earlier source, with a hint of the chu construction, is George
Mackey's work on barreled spaces, as pointed out to me by Bill Lawvere.

I want to comment on Juergen's question.  It is possible, I suppose,
that Grothendieck used the phrase "dualizing object" somewhere, but as
far as I am aware, he never did anything with them.  It is not, after
all, a difficult concept.  He certainly never talked about "*-autonomous
categories", although Grothendieck (and everyone else who ever gave it a
thought) was surely aware that finite dimensional vectors spaces and
finite abelian groups were such.  If he ever isolated the concept as an
interesting one, I am unaware of it and, in any case, I don't believe he
ever pursued it (someone would surely have let me know by now).  This
mad insistence on giving Grothendieck credit for every fleeting idea he
may (or even may not) have mentioned somewhere is a perfect example of
how the star system (no pun intended) has permeated our consciousness.
I am not, of course, blaming Grothendieck for any of this.  In another
instance, one of the best ideas I ever had has been named after Euler,
who never heard of cohomology groups.

Now, as I have said elsewhere, I was very much aware of the "pairs" of
vector spaces used by the topological vector space theorists when I
created the Chu construction.  I believe that the sources I had seen
stuck to the separated extensional case.  They did not mention that this
construction was originally due to Mackey, although I eventually (fairly
recently) tracked it down.  It was in his PhD thesis, in fact.  I
believe he did not stick to the separated extensional case.  But neither
he, nor anyone else I read talked about morphisms of pairs.  In the se
case, the morphisms are obvious.  In the general case a bit less so.
The duality was, of course, obvious and the main raison d'etre for the
pairs.  But, although it was obvious how to make the morphisms between
two pairs into a vector space, no one seems to have even raised the
question of making it into a pair.  That it is possible and even easly
struck me--and still strikes me--as an amazing bit of magic.

Inquiry to: categories list-serve subscribers
 
In the mid- to late 70s there were meetings at Columbia University in New
York of mathematicians interested in topos theory, which meetings I
attended as a student of Peter Freyd. 
 
At one such meeting, someone proposed and solved the following problem,
which I have since named The Manhattan Street Problem.  (Note: it was NOT
so named at the time.) 
 
    Consider a large number of commuters, all traveling from
    south to north along two parallel highways.  Connecting the
    two north-south highways are one (or more?) east-west linking
    streets, all of which are one way from west to east.  The
    speed at which a commuter moves along any highway or street
    is a function of the number of users on that (part of that)
    highway or street, e.g., as more commuters who are initially
    on the western of the two north-south highways choose to
    leave and go over to the eastern of the two north-south
    highways, the speed of traffic on the western highway
    increases and the speed on the eastern highway decreases. The
    functions relating speed to number of users are not
    (necessarily) the same for each highway or street.  (I think,
    however, that the most elegant solution would have a single
    function applicable to both highways and (all) street(s).)
    Each commuter chooses whether (and when, if there's more than
    one cross over street) to go over to the eastern highway in
    an attempt to minimize individual total travel time.
 
    Problem:  Specify the speed controlling function(s), the
    number of crossing east-west roads and, if necessary, the
    distances, e.g., distance between eastern and western
    highways as a fraction of total north-south distance, or
    distance between various east-west roads, again presumably as
    a fraction of total north-south distance, such that:  the
    system stabilizes, i.e., individual commuters cannot improve
    their time by changing their route, BUT the total travel time
    summed over all travelers is NOT a minimum.  Thus, if such a
    solution is found, an omniscient, big brother traffic
    controller, by (randomly?) requiring some commuters to take a
    route slower than what he/she would individually choose,
    could thereby decrease (minimize?) travel time (hence air
    pollution?) for the whole commuting community.
 
Plausibility argument that this might be possible:  That the
situation stabilizes seems intuitively plausible to me.  That the
stable situation might not minimize total travel time is
suggested by the following:  If the big brother traffic
controller moves an individual from a too heavily traveled
highway, the benefit flows to a large number of commuters left
behind on that highway, which flows faster, even though the moved
individual may be shunted over to a route slower for that
individual.
 
If anyone:  a) remembers who presented and solved this problem at
Columbia, or b) remembers the solution, or c) can point me toward
where this might be solved in the literature, or d) can provide
any other help, I would be extremely grateful.
 
Samuel Johnson  (sjohnson@mail.sjcsf.edu)
 
Postscript:  A solution would have (obvious?) implications for
those who have great faith in the general applicability of free
market mechanisms and Adam Smith's invisible hand for solving
problems or finding best strategies from a society's point of
view.

               "http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~eric/sgm/"
              --------------------------------------------

  State Graph Manipulators (SGM) is a high-level state-graph manipulation 
  tool for verification non-experts as well as experts. The tool has
  undergone further refining and testing. A much more stable version (v1.1)
  is now released for downloading. This version provides both a batch
  and an interactive user interface. The next version (v1.2) scheduled
  to be released around January 31, 1999 will have a flexible easy-to-use
  graphical user interface (GUI).

                     Changes in v1.1 from v1.0

(1) Memory usage drastically reduced to 1/8th of that originally 
    required in SGM v1.0. Memory leaks removed using Purify, a 
    commercial program debugging tool from Rational Software.
(2) SGM input language syntax modified to accomodate non-symmetrical
    system descriptions. Non-symmetrical systems can now be described!
(3) A new manipulator (state-graph reduction technique) implemented:
    BIT (Bypass Internal-Transition).
(4) Totally 5 application examples included with v1.1 distribution.
    (a) Fischer's Mutual Exclusion Protocol,
    (b) CSMA/CD Protocol,
    (c) Token Ring Network,
    (d) PATHO OS Priority-Based Task Execution, and
    (e) Bus Arbiter.
(5) User manual updated to version 1.1.
(6) Programming bugs/errors fixed.
(7) Interactive user interface improved.
(8) A graphical user interface has been developed and is being testing
    currently, it will be released in the next version SGM v1.2
    around January 31, 1999.

I may have misunderstood, but I didn't think anyone even implied that
Grothendieck could be credited with *-autonomous categories. Juergen was just
asking about the history of the idea of dualizing object, which is just a part
of that structure, and certainly predates it.

The fact that an idea may have been in the air before it was captured in a
structure does not have to decrease the merit of capturing it; on the
contrary, it may also be thought of as a sign that it was an important idea,
or that capturing it wasn't easy. The fact that Wiles was drawing upon a rich
source of ideas does not devaluate his victory.

This is a remarkable phenomenon, isn't it? Cartesius also knew nothing of
Cartesian categories (or squares, or arrows...), and Frobenius could hardly
recognize the logical form of his reciprocity...

I think Etruscans had this religion, where they systematically attributed all
victories to the ancestors, so that the soldiers wouldn't take things too
personally.

With kind regards,

             PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC
               70th meeting -- Second Announcement

The 70th meeting of the PSSL will be held in Cambridge on the weekend of
27-28 February 1999. As usual, we welcome contributed talks on any aspect
of category theory, sheaf theory or related areas of logic and computer
science.

As previously announced, this meeting will be a special one to celebrate 
the 60th birthday of Gavin Wraith, who has been involved with the
Peripatetic Seminar since its inception in 1976. We therefore particularly
welcome talks relating to areas in which Gavin has worked.

Those intending to come to the meeting should complete the registration 
form below, and return it as soon as possible to <ptj@dpmms.cam.ac.uk>.
We shall attempt to arrange accommodation in College guest rooms (or,
failing that, in local bed and breakfast establishments) for those who
request it before 17 February.

Lectures will take place in the Isaac Newton Institute, Clarkson Road,
beginning at 9.30 on Saturday and ending by lunchtime on Sunday. An 
informal bread-and-cheese lunch will be provided on both days. Details of
other arrangements, including a provisional programme, will be sent out
about a week before the meeting to those who have registered.

Subject: categories: two questions about universal quantification 
From: Barry Jay <cbj@socs.uts.edu.au>
Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca
Precedence: bulk
Status: O
X-Status: 


Can anyone help with the following two questions? 
Barry Jay



Question 1 
~~~~~~~~~~

Has the following lemma been seen before? 

Lemma: If D is a cartesian closed category having all finite limits
then so is its arrow category.

Proof

Finite limits in the arrow category are constructed pointwise. 
Arrows from a: A -> I to b: B-> J In the arrow category are given by
commuting squares (all vertical lines are arrows pointing down)

      f
  A -----> B
  |        |
 a|        |b
  |        |
  I -----> J
      u

The object of such appropriate pairs (f,u) is given by the pullback

  E -----> A->B
  |         |
  |         | A->b
  |         |
 I->J ---> A->J
     a->J

The universal property follows directly. QED

The proof uses a form of universal quantification over A.
Similar constructions arise with the use of ends and dinatural
transformations. I also used them aggresively in my paper on data
categories (http://linus/~cbj/Publications/data_categories.ps.gz) to
quantify over all paths through a tree. The lemma generalises to other
functor categories over D provided there are sufficient limits in D to
express all of the constraints.


Question 2 
~~~~~~~~~~

The proof above shows how pullbacks and cartesian closure interact to
provide a form of universal quantification.  Call this new
construction quantification by exponentiation. What is its expressive
power?

Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~

Universal quantification wrt an arrow f : X -> Y is usually given as a
right adjoint to the functor D/Y --> D/X which pulls back along f.
Call this quantification by adjunction. When it is specialised to a
projection XxY ---> X then it can be thought of as quantification over
the object Y. Quantification by exponentiation can be seen as
supplying some of the ingredients necessary for this special case. For
example, consider the equaliser E of two functions into an
exponential:

  f,g : X --> (A->B)

If the quantifier by adjunction exists for the projection XxA ---> X
then E is given by applying it to the equaliser of the uncurried forms
of f and g from XxA to B. 
  
Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

One the one hand, this structure is weaker than that normally assumed,
which may sometimes be a good thing. On the other hand, the power
resulting from this combination of features may still be more than
desired.

Many models of computation assume both cartesian closure and and all
finite limits but this is already more than we need to model the types
of most languages, i.e. a type corresponding to one of the objects
produced by quantification by exponentiation would have undecidable
membership, so that values would need to come equipped with a proof of
their membership. So (assuming that cartesian closure is a given) the
question becomes whether there is a smaller class of limits which are
good enough to model programming languages. 

One candidate is to work in an extensive category, in which only
pullbacks along coproduct inclusions are presumed. A short argument
shows that if Z has decidable equality then any cospan over it has a
pullback. Actually, there is a rich, but under-explored class of
pullbacks implied by this innocuous assumption. For example, the list
functor preserves such pullbacks (this is not quite trivial). There
may well be other, better candidates. I would be glad to hear of them.

This is a special case of the cartesian closedness of a category 
obtained by Artin glueing, which was covered in the Carboni--Johnstone
paper (Math. Struct. Comp. Sci. 5 (1995), 441--459). (However, we don't
claim any originality for it; it is implicit in Gavin Wraith's 1974
paper on Artin glueing.) Of course, the "glueing functor" in Barry's case
is the identity on D.

If I've not misunderstood Barry's question 1, this is surely just the 
gluing or sconing lemma for the particular functor id_D : D -> D, 
where

     Glue(id_D) = arrow(D)

Gluing along the identity gives a pleasant form for exponentials; the
glued exponentials in Glue(G) for some G : C -> D collapse to the diagram
in Barry's note.

     "HARDWARE-SOFTWARE CODESIGN OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS"
     ________________________________________________________________

         "http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~eric/pdpta99-codesign/"

      The 1999 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed
                Processing Techniques and Applications
                               (PDPTA'99)

                          June 28 - July 1, 1999
                  Monte Carlo Resort, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA

A special session on the HARDWARE-SOFTWARE CODESIGN of parallel and 
distributed systems is being organized at PDPTA'99, which will be
held in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.A., June 28 - July 1, 1999.

Architectures supporting parallel and distributed computing include 
both hardware and software. The success of such architectures depends 
significantly on how the hardware and software interact. This in turn 
requires careful codesign approaches which include co-partitioning, 
scheduling, co-synthesis, co-simulation, and co-verification. Due to
their complex behavior and structural restrictions, parallel and 
distributed systems present a greater challenge to codesign 
methodologies than conventional systems.  Object-oriented modeling/design, 
formal specification/verification methods, graph-theoretic analysis,
virtual prototyping, functional/structural partitioning are some 
promising techniques which can be employed for hardware-software codesign. 
Parallel and distributed processing is the computing trend and 
hardware-software codesign is the technique for supporting this trend.

SESSION SCOPE: 
  All hardware-software codesign related topics that deal with parallel
and distributed systems are invited. Topics of interest include, 
but are not limited to, the following:

   *  Specification/Modeling         *  Object-Oriented Technology
   *  Co-design Methodologies/Tools  *  Parallel/Distributed Techniques
   *  Co-partitioning                *  Virtual Prototyping 
   *  Related Software Synthesis     *  Rapid Prototyping
   *  Related Hardware Synthesis     *  High-Assurance Systems
   *  Co-simulation and Validation   *  IP / Virtual Components
   *  Co-verification and Testing    *  Embedded/Real-Time Systems

LOCATION OF CONFERENCE:

      The conference will be held in the Monte Carlo Resort
      hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.  This is a mega hotel
      with excellent conference facilities and over 3000 rooms.
      The hotel is minutes from the Las Vegas airport with free
      shuttles to and from the airport.  This hotel has many
      vacation and recreational attractions, including:
      waterfalls, casino, spa, pools & kiddie pools, sunning decks,
      Easy River water ride, wave pool with cascades, lighted
      tennis courts, health spa (with workout equipment, whirlpool,
      sauna, ...), arcade virtual reality game rooms, nightly
      shows, snack bars, a number of restaurants, shopping
      area, bars, ...  Many of these attractions are open 24
      hours a day and most are suitable for families and children.
      The negotiated hotel's room rate for conference attendees
      is very reasonable ($79 + tax) per night (no extra charge
      for double occupancy) for the duration of the conference.

      The hotel is within walking distance from most other
      Las Vegas attractions (major shopping areas, recreational
      destinations, fine dining and night clubs, free street
      shows, ...).
      For the benefit of our international colleagues: the state of
      Nevada neighbors with the states of California, Oregon, Idaho,
      Utah, and Arizona.  Las Vegas is only a few driving hours away
      from other major cities, including: Los Angeles, San Diego,
      Phoenix, Grand Canyon, ...

The Maude system, its documentation, a collection of examples, and a list
of related papers are available (free of charge) on the web at
  
     http://maude.csl.sri.com

Maude is a high-performance reflective language and system supporting both 
equational and rewriting logic specification and programming for a wide range
of applications.  Maude has been influenced in important ways by the OBJ3
language, which can be regarded as an equational logic sublanguage.  Besides
supporting equational specification and programming, Maude also supports
rewriting logic computation.

Rewriting logic is a logic of concurrent change that can naturally deal with
state and with concurrent computations.  It has good properties as a general
semantic framework for giving executable semantics to a wide range of
languages and models of concurrency.  In particular, it supports very well
concurrent object-oriented computation.  The same reasons making rewriting
logic a good semantic framework make it also a good logical framework, that
is, a metalogic in which many other logics can be naturally represented and
executed.

Maude supports in a systematic and efficient way logical reflection.  This
makes Maude remarkably extensible and powerful, supports an extensible algebra
of module composition operations, and allows many advanced metaprogramming and
metalanguage applications.  Indeed, some of the most interesting applications
of Maude are metalanguage applications, in which Maude is used to create
executable environments for different logics, theorem provers, languages, and
models of computation.

Would someone let me know the answer and the proof or counter example of
the following question? 

Suppose the category C has a pullback for every pair of morphism 
(f : X -> Y, g : W -> Y). Let K be the full subcategory of the functor
category Func(C,Set) whose objects are pullback perserving functors.
Is K ccc? (If so, how I can show this?)

Thanks,
Hongseok

Unless I am missing something, it seems to me that for any CCC C with
finite limits and any finite category I, the functor category C^I is a
CCC.  You can also replace finite by any cardinal if you do it in both
places.  The argument is roughly this.  Let |I| denote the discrete
category with the objects of I.  The inclusion |I| --> I induces U: C^I
--> C^{|I|} and the limits imply the existence of a right adjoint R of U.
Since U also preserves limits, the cotriple (UR,e,d) preserves finite
limits.  It is easy to see that U is cotripleable and that C^{|I|} is a
CCC and, hence, so is C^I.  For define A -o RC = R(UA -o C).  For a
general object B, the line B --> URB ==> URURB is an equalizer and you can
define A -o B as the equalizer of A -o URB ==> A -o URURB.

CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS AND PARTICIPATION

    15th British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science (BCTCS 15)

    14th - 16th April 1999 at Keele University

    Supported by EPSRC and the London Mathematical Society

___________________________________________________________________________

INVITED SPEAKERS:    Wan Fokkink  (Swansea)
                     Martin Hofmann (Edinburgh)

___________________________________________________________________________

CONTRIBUTED TALKS

Contributions are sought on any aspect of theoretical computer science.
Research areas within the scope of BCTCS include, but are not limited to,
the following list:

     Concurrency, types, semantics, formal methods, computational complexity,
     algorithms, discrete mathematics, proof theory and logic, 
     artificial intelligence, database theory, theorem proving,
     symbolic computation and experimental work.

This year for the first time, authors  will have the option to submit
papers based on their talks to a special issue of the
Journal of Universal Computer Science. However, the meeting will retain
its informal character, and it will still be possible for researchers to 
give a presentation at the meeting but not have their paper considered for
publication. Submission of papers for publication will take place at some
stage after the meeting.

Besides talks from established researchers, BCTCS meetings provide a forum
for  young researchers who may wish to give a presentation but who may feel
that the body of their work is not yet substantial enough for publication.
___________________________________________________________________________

SUPPORT FOR POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS

A limited number of fully funded places are available to postgraduate students
who are supported by EPSRC. For other students there is a SPECIAL REDUCED RATE
for the meeting, and some additional financial support may be available in
special cases.
___________________________________________________________________________

FURTHER DETAILS

Further details, including registration forms, prices, and forms for submission
of contributed talks, are available from the BCTCS15 web page:

    http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/cs/Announcements/bctcs/
    
The web page also has links to previous BCTCS meetings, which provide a useful
guide to the wide range of topics which have been covered by past contributions.

The answer is no. First note that K is closed under products in the
functor category. Also, it contains all the representable functors; 
so, if it were cartesian closed, the exponential G^F would have to be 
given by 

G^F(c) \cong nat((c,-),G^F) \cong nat((c,-)\times F,G)

i.e. K would have to be closed under exponentials in [C,Set]. However,
it isn't in general. For a simple counterexample, let C be the category
with five objects a,b,c,d,e and six non-identity morphisms

a --> b, a --> c, b --> d, c --> d, a --> d, a --> e ;

note that C has just one nontrivial pullback square

            a -----> b
            |        |
            |        |
            v        v
            c -----> d

Let F be the functor given by F(a) = F(b) = F(c) = F(d) = \emptyset,
F(e) = {*}, and let G be F + F. Then (taking the above definition of G^F)
G^F(a) has two elements, but G^F(b), G^F(c) and G^F(d) are singletons.

Generalized Enrichment for Categories and Multicategories

In this paper we answer the question: `what kind of a structure can a general
multicategory be enriched in?' (Here `general multicategory' is used in the
sense of the author, Burroni or Hermida.) The answer is, in a sense to
be made precise, that a multicategory of one type can be enriched in a
multicategory of the type one level up. In particular, we will be able to
speak of a T_n-multicategory enriched in a T_{n+1}-multicategory, where
T_n is the monad expressing the pasting-together of n-opetopes.

The answer for general multicategories reduces to something surprising in the
case of ordinary categories: a category may be enriched in an
`fc-multicategory', a very general kind of 2-dimensional structure
encompassing monoidal categories, plain multicategories, bicategories and
double categories. It turns out that fc-multicategories also provide a
natural setting for the bimodules construction. We also explore enrichment
for some multicategories other than just categories. An extended application
is given: the relaxed multicategories of Borcherds and Soibelman are
explained in terms of enrichment.

    Whether or not these functors form a cartesian-closed category
depends strongly on the nature of the domain category.  For example,
if the domain category is an abelian category as opposed to it
being a pretopos.  Related matters are discussed in the recent
paper by  Borceux and Pedicchio and the papers there cited:
Left-exact presheaves on a small pretopos, Journal of Pure and
Applied Algebra, vol. 135, no. 1, 4 Febr. 1999, pp 9 - 22.

Hi,

I am looking for advise on suitable litterature for a beginner in
bicategory-theory. The litterature I have found so far is:

Kelly, Street  Review of the elements of 2-categories
Borceux        Handbook of categorical algebra 1

I have also ordered the following article:

Benabou        Introduction to bicategories

So far I have only read Borceux's book but it contains mainly
definitions. In particular I have difficulties understanding
the need for (and consequences of) the coherence axioms
associated with the natural isomorphisms expressing the
associativity and identity 'axioms'.

Lars, I would guess that you will get more advice than you can
use. Here is my nickel's worth. The matter of coherence is
wide open. There is a paper of Yanofsky accepted for publication
in JPAA which investigates higher dimensional categories with
no coherence assumptions at all -- this coming after a lot of
work on weakened coherence. Benabou's basic point was that
naturally arising 2-dimensional categories are not quite
2-categories and don't seem to suffer from it. Avoid getting
knotted in coherence questions, especially in 1999.

A heavily revised version of my paper "Beyond the Chu-construction"
is now available from my home page:

	http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/~koslowj/RESEARCH/

It will eventually be published in Applied Categorical Structures.
I have not attempted to attribute the term "dualizing object" to anyone
in particular.  The open problem of an earlier version, as to whether
Cauchy-complete bicategories of interpolads inherit local *-autonomy 
from their base, has been answered affirmatively.  

Here is the abstract:


  Starting from symmetric monoidal closed (= autonomous) categories,
  Po-Hsiang Chu showed how to construct new *-autonomous categories,
  i.e., autonomous categories that are self-dual because of a
  dualizing object.  Recently, Michael Barr extended this to the
  non-symmetric, but closed, case, utilizing monads and modules
  between them.  Since these notions are well-understood for
  bicategories, we introduce a notion of local *-autonomy for these
  that implies closedness and, moreover, is inherited when forming
  bicategories of monads and of interpolads.  Since the initial step
  of Barr's construction also carries over to the bicategorical
  setting, we recover his main result as an easy corollary.
  Furthermore, the Chu-construction at this level may be viewed as a
  procedure for turning the endo-1-cells of a closed bicategory into
  the objects of a new closed bicategory, and hence conceptually is
  similar to constructing bicategories of monads and of interpolads.

what does "no coherence assumptions at all" mean in this context?
does it mean that yanofsky is studying what i call "coarse
n-categories", defined recursively as categories enriched over the
cartesian closed category where the objects are the coarse
[n-1]-categories and the morphisms are the enriched natural
isomorphism classes of enriched functors?  coarse n-categories are
interesting but they're obviously not the whole story; for example
it's straightforward to define the "fundamental coarse n-groupoid" of
a space, but it's indeed a rather coarse invariant of the homotopy
type.
