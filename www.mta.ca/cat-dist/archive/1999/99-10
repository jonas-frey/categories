Dear members of the mailing list, I'm pleased to annouce that the paper

        ``Rewriting on Cyclic Structures'',

by myself and Andrea Corradini, is available at
http://www.di.unipi.it/~gadducci/papers/RAIRO.ps.
The abstract follows, but shortly, it uses traced monoidal 2-categories
--where, in addition, each object ha`s a comonoidal structure-- in order
to simulate various kinds of (eventually cyclic) term (graph) rewriting.

Its interest for a broader audience may lie, besides in showing a
practical application of the trace structure in the rewriting field, in
its appendix, where we tried to sketch a very SHORT history of the
notion of feedback in theoretical computer science, with a particular
attention to the algebraic specification field. We found it interesting
to review previous approaches to the topic, after the results of
Joyal-Street-Verity have newly sparkled the interest in the algebraic
description of fixed points (see e.g. the recent paper by Selinger
advertised a few weeks ago on this mailing list).

Best regards,

Fabio Gadducci

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

\begin{abstract}
We present a categorical formulation of the rewriting of possibly cyclic
term graphs, based on a variation of algebraic 2-theories. We show that
this presentation is equivalent to the well-accepted operational
definition proposed by Barendregt et alii---but for the case of
``circular redexes'', for which we propose (and justify formally) a
different treatment. The categorical framework allows us to model in a
concise way
also automatic garbage collection and rules for sharing/unsharing and
folding/unfolding of structures, and to relate term graph rewriting to
other rewriting formalisms.
\end{abstract}

			      Call for Papers

			     Special Issue of

	    Mathematical Structures in Computer Science (MSCS)

				    on

		  Realizability Semantics and Applications

       Editors: L. Birkedal, J. van Oosten, G. Rosolini, D.S. Scott


There has been recently a reawaking of interest in many aspects of
realizability interpretations -- especially as regards semantics of type
theories for constructive reasoning and semantics of programming languages.
But, the details of realizability can be quite technical, and therefore a
tutorial workshop on realizability and appliations was held in
June/July 1999 in Trento, Italy.  The workshop contained both tutorial
lectures and also contributed research talks, see 
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/birkedal/www/realizability-workshop/
for an overview.  

A special issue of the journal Mathematical Structures in Computer Science
(MSCS) will be devoted to papers on realizability semantics and
applications.  The volume will contain the tutorial presentations given by
invited speakers at the realizability workshop in Trento.  We now also
solicit contributions of research papers on realizability and applications
for the special MSCS volume.  Everyone is invited to contribute a paper
(i.e., not only researchers who contributed a paper to the realizability
workshop).  Papers will be refereed to the usual high standards of MSCS.

Instruction to Authors

Authors are invited to submit full original research papers. Papers
should be submitted via email to wr99@athena.disi.unige.it as a postscript

                  Announcement of PhD Studentship in

                       Categorical Rewriting

A PhD student is sought for three years from January 2000 to work
under the supervision of Dr Neil Ghani on a UK EPSRC-funded project
``Categorical Rewriting''

A brief description of the project is included below. Further details
can be obtained by emailing Dr Ghani at ng13@mcs.le.ac.uk

Project Description
-------------------

Term Rewriting Systems (TRSs) are widely used throughout computer
science as they form an abstract model of computation while retaining
a relatively simple and concrete syntax. However, this concreteness
has led to a tendency to concentrate on the technical details of
specific problems to the detriment of a wider understanding of the
subject. 

This project aims to address this problem by developing a categorical
semantics for rewriting. The project builds on recent work by Dr Ghani
which showed that TRSs can be regarded as generalised algebraic
theories and consequently that TRSs can be modelled as enriched
monads. We want to extend this reasearch in a number of
directions, eg the development of the semantics to cover more complex
notions of rewriting and the application of our research to 
open problems in rewriting.

The classical relationship between the curvature of a connection,

                   -----------------------------------

                     http://www.di.uminho.pt/mpc2000
            
                             3--5 July, 2000

                         Ponte de Lima, Portugal


This conference aims to promote the development of mathematical principles
and techniques that are demonstrably useful and usable in the process of
constructing computer programs (whether implemented in hardware or software).
The focus of the conference is on techniques that combine precision with
concision, enabling programs to be constructed by formal calculation.
Within this theme, the scope of the conference is very diverse.
We welcome contributions to  programming methodology (for example, formal
methods for program specification and  transformation), to programming
paradigms (for example, generic programming techniques and type systems)
and to language design (for example, programming calculi and programming
language semantics).  Theoretical contributions are welcome provided their
relevance to program construction is evident; discussion of applications is
welcome provided the mathematical basis is evident.

A number of workshops will be organised in conjunction with the conference.


                            IMPORTANT DATES

Deadline for submission of papers:    3rd January, 2000
Notification of acceptance/rejection: 29th February, 2000
Final papers due:                     17th April, 2000

Full papers should be submitted in Postscript format by e-mail to reach
Jose Oliveira by 3rd January, 2000.


                              PROCEEDINGS 

The conference proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag.
Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit a suitably revised and/or
extended paper for inclusion in a special issue of Science of Computer
Programming.

To those planning to participate in the McGill OktoberFest:

  At the McGill OktoberFest this weekend, Barbara & I will be bringing along
another half-dozen or so color copies of the Buffalo AMS Special Session
picture book
(for those who didn't get to see it at Coimbra), as well as one preliminary
mock-up
of its Coimbra CT'99 sequel (likely to be ready for distribution within a
month).

  These won't be on steady display, but I'll always have them with me, and
anyone
hoping to steal a peek at one volume or the other can just ask me during a
break.

                        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


                Workshop on Refinement and Abstraction

                           Nov 15-17, 1999

                              ETL Osaka
                                Japan

                http://www.etl.go.jp/~yoshiki/RAW.html


Refinement has become an important research field in computer science.
It was first proposed in the engineering context of verification of
large scale programs, or "verification in the large."  The idea was to
put together a proof that a program behaves correctly assuming the
correctness of the library modules in use and a correctness proof of
those modules, obtaining a full proof of program correctness.  There
have been scientific attempts to analyse refinement using universal
algebra, relational algebra and lattice theory.  In the late 90's,
those mathematical tools have extended to category theory, and a
deeper connection with traditional programming semantics is now being
sought.

On the other hand, the programming technique called "abstract
interpretation" has turned out to be useful for software verification.
It has led to a hybrid method called abstract model checking, which is
an amalgamation of the deductive formal proof method and model
checking.  In particular, abstraction is useful in reducing the number
of states of a transition system, making model checking more tractable
in many cases.

The words "refinement" and "abstraction" sound as though they have
opposite directions.  The two approaches, however, seem to have much
in common.  For instance, transformations between two models (an
"abstract" model and "concrete" model) play an essential role in both
methods.  The aim of this workshop is to provide an opportunity for
people working in refinement and abstraction to get together and to
learn how the two fields are related.  To that end, we shall limit the
number of attendants (to about 30 people) for economy of
communication.

We plan to publish an after-meeting-booklet containing articles
related to the talks given in the workshop.

Invited speakers:

        Ralph-Johan Back (Abo Akademi University, Turku)
        Patrick Cousot (ENS, Paris)
        He Jifeng (United Nations University, Macau)
        David Schmidt (Kansas State University)

	I thought many on the list might like to know about John 
Isbell's remarkable progress even over the last weekend. He is 
regaining bodily strength rapidly. More importantly, he is beginning 
to read again with some pleasure, and to converse and write (!) with 
his usual intelligence and precision.
	And wit: Yesterday, I tried to help him move to a more 
comfortable position but did not succeed and remarked, "Close but no 
cigar!". He immediately asked if I had heard about a reporter's 
interview with Clinton's other tell- all friend, Gennifer Flowers. I 
hadn't. Seems she was asked if her relationship with the president 
had been like that of Miss Lewinski. The reply was, "Close, but no 
cigar".
	Best regards, Jack
P.S. If any one wants to contact John by e-mail, for the moment, just 
sent it to me and note that it is for him. I will make sure that he 
gets it.

                              for the 

    WORKSHOP ON COALGEBRAIC METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (CMCS'2000)




Scope

State-based dynamical systems as found throughout computing science are traditionally described as transition systems or certain kinds of
automata. During the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that such systems can be captured uniformly as so-called ``coalgebras'' (which
are the formal dual of algebras). Coalgebra is beginning to develop into a field of its own, with its own proof-methods (involving bisimulations and
invariants). This workshop will be devoted to both an introduction to basic coalgebraic notions and techniques, and also to some recent advances in
the theory of coalgebras. 

We are looking for participants and contributed talks to this informal workshop on both the theory and the use of coalgebras in computer science.
The workshop will consist of two days, preceding the ETAPS conference (25-26 March, 2000) at the Technical University of Berlin. More
information regarding submissions is given below. 

The scope of the meeting includes the following themes: 

 - the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical 
      approaches); 
 - coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming 
      languages, dynamic systems, etc.); 
 - coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming; 
 - coalgebras and data types; 
 - (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
      bisimulations or invariants); 
 - coalgebras and (hidden-sorted) algebras; 
 - coalgebraic specification and verification; 
 - coalgebras and (modal) logic 

Organization: Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen), Horst Reichel(Dresden), Jan Rutten (CWI, Amsterdam) and Larry Moss (Bloomington, IN). 

Program Committee: H. Peter Gumm (Marburg), Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen), Ugo Montanari (Pisa), Larry Moss (Bloomington, IN), Ataru T.
Nakagawa (Tokyo), John Power (Edinburgh), Horst Reichel (Dresden), Jan Rutten (CWI, Amsterdam). 

Submissions

The following dates are important for submission to the ENTCS volume. 

   -  3 January 2000: deadline for submissions. 
   -  11 February 2000: notification of acceptance. 
   -  3 March 2000: final version. 
   -  25-26 March 2000: workshop, where a printed version of the ENTCS 
      issue will be available for participants. 
   -  (25 March - 2 April, 2000: ETAPS conference). 

The ideal submission is not longer than 20 pages, and gives a clear exposition of the relevant ideas. It can be sent by email to: Horst Reichel, or by
ordinary mail to:

  First International Conference on Computational Logic, CL2000
               Imperial College, London, UK 
                  24th to 28th July, 2000 
                                      
                    2nd call for papers


CL2000 is the first conference in a major new series of annual
international conferences bringing together the various communities
of researchers who have a common interest in Computational Logic.  

CL2000 is collocating with the following conferences: 

DOOD2000: 6th Int'l Conference on Rules and Objects in Databases 
ILP2000: 10th Int'l Workshop on Inductive Logic Programming 
LOPSTR2000: 10th Int'l Workshop on Logic-based Program Synthesis 
            and Transformation 

CL2000 will include seven streams covering various subfields of
computational logic, each with its own separate Program Committee: 

   - Database Systems (DOOD2000)      
   - Program Development (LOPSTR2000)            
   - Knowledge Representation and Non-monotonic Reasoning       
   - Automated Deduction: Putting Theory into Practice   
   - Constraints        
   - Logic Programming: Theory and Extensions       
   - Logic Programming: Implementations and Applications 
   
The last three streams effectively constitute the former ICLP
conference series that will be now integrated into CL2000. 
  
ILP2000 will be collocating as a separate conference.

Papers on all aspects of the theory, implementation, and
application of Computational Logic are invited, where
Computational Logic is to be understood broadly as the use of
logic in Computer Science. 

Provisional deadlines:          
   Papers must be submitted by 1 February, 2000        
   Authors will be notified of acceptance/rejection by 1 May, 2000         
   Camera-ready versions must be received by 1 June, 2000  
            
Further information is available at the conference web site:

The classifier, \Omega, for subgraphs has two nodes and five edges.
The bi-Heyting algebra of subgraphs of a graph has two complement
like operators, $\neg$ and $\suppl$. These satisfy
$G \meet \neg G = \bot$ and $G \join \suppl G = \top$.
One of these ($\neg$) arises from 
an endomorphism of $\Omega$ but the other does not.

The operations $\neg$ and $\suppl$ are nicely dual in some ways
but only one can be described in terms of $\Omega$.
Is there some kind of explanation for this?

It is possible to find a graph $\Delta$ and to describe a given 
subgraph as a morphism to $\Delta$ and to obtain $\suppl$ as an
endomorphism of $\Delta$. But although there is a morphism
from $\Delta$ to $\Omega$, we don't get $\neg$ via any endomorphism
of $\Delta$. $\Delta$ has four nodes corresponding to a classification
of nodes as (1) out (2) in and with all incident edges in (3) in and
with all incident edges out (4) in and with some incident edges in
and some out. Of course this is analogous to the edges in 
$\Omega$. There are four kinds of edge identified by $\Omega$
(working with a version of $\Omega$ for undirected graphs)
(1) in (2) out and with all incident nodes out (3) out and
with all incident nodes in (4) out and with some incident nodes out
and some in. Is there a formal sense in which $\Delta$ and $\Omega$
are dual to each other? Is there a better way to view $\suppl$ as
coming from some kind of classifier of graphs?

Does anyone have any comments or suggestions for relevant literature?

The coHeyting complement (i.e. the "least supplement") is not a natural
endomorphism of the subobject functor, hence is not implemented by an 
endomap of the (unique) representing object for that functor.This
productive contradiction was apparently known already to medieval
logicians in the sense that certain logical operators are not preserved by
substitution (here one substitutes along any map in the topos). That
there is still information to be found about this was hinted at by my 1990
result presented at Como (see Springer Lecture Notes in Math 1488) where a
nontrivial class of presheaf toposes was shown to satisfy the Leibniz
product rule for the coHeyting boundary ("A and not A" where not means the
least supplement); this rule is equivalent to substitutivity along
projection maps but not all maps !

Unfortunately I don't fully grasp which is the graph Delta that Dr. Stell
is working with but it doesn't seem to be the following. Some
relevant concepts richer than a single subobject may also be
representable,for example, the concept of a subobject together with
another subobject whose union with it is the whole. The union map from
omega cross omega to omega classifies a subobject which does that representing
job and which has an obvious endomap which switches.This general
construction gives in the case of graphs a 9-edge graph with 3 nodes, I
believe. There seems to be no way to make these pseudo-supplements any
smaller for the general graphs since the top element is isolated in the
lattice of truth values)

Dear Comprox and Categories members,

Here is a short note that Reinhold Heckmann and I have written. Your
comments are welcome, as always.

                     On function spaces in topology
                     ------------------------------

    It is the purpose of this expository note to provide a
    self-contained, elementary and brief development of the fact that
    the exponentiable topological spaces are precisely the
    core-compact spaces. The only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of
    topology (continuous functions, product topology and compactness).
    We hope that teachers and students of topology will find this
    useful. As far as we know, there is no such development available
    in the literature.  Although there are one or two embellishments,
    our methods are certainly not original.  We briefly discuss more
    advanced treatments in the introduction.

To clarify what I meant by the graph Delta in my earlier message,
we can proceed via hypergraphs. In what follows all graphs are
undirected, so Omega has two nodes and four edges. Define a hypergraph
to be a function h : E -> PN, where E and N are sets of edges and nodes
and PN is the powerset of N. Each hypergraph has dual h* : N -> PE
where h* n = {e \in E | n \in h e}. 

A morphism of hypergraphs is a pair of functions phi_N : N_1 -> N_2
and phi_E : E_1 -> E_2 such that P phi_N h_1 subseteq h_2 phi_E.
If H and K are graphs a hypergraph morphism from H to K may not
be a graph morphism since a loop can be mapped to an edge which is not
a loop. However, given any hypergraph h we can define a graph having
the same nodes as h but with an edge joining node x to y for every
edge in h incident with both x and y. If this graph is denoted
by G(h), hypergraph morphisms from a graph K to a hypergraph h
correspond to graph morphisms from K to G(h). The graph I called 
Delta before is G(Omega*) it has four nodes and nine edges.

To explain the interpretation of Omega*, let's denote the nodes of
Omega by 0 and 1 and the four edges by {1}1, {1}0, {0,1}0, {0}0.
Given a subgraph gamma : H -> Omega, the nodes and edges have the
following interpretations.
  0      nodes not in the subgraph
  1      nodes in the subgraph
  {1}1   edges in the subgraph
  {1}0   edges not in the subgraph but with both end nodes in 
  {0,1}0 edges not in the subgraph but with one end in and one out
  {0}0   edges not in the subgraph with both end nodes out.

Now give Omega* the following interpretation
  0      edges in the subgraph
  1      edges not in the subgraph
  {1}1   nodes not in the subgraph
  {1}0   nodes in the subgraph which are ends of a non-empty set of
         edges all of which are out of the subgraph.
  {0,1}0 nodes in the subgraph which are ends of some edges in the 
         subgraph and ends of some edges which are out of the subgraph.
  {0}0   nodes in the subgraph having all their incident edges in the 
         subgraph, or having no incident edges.

Given any subgraph gamma : H -> Omega, we get neg gamma from
the endomorphism of Omega switching 0 and 1 and taking {0}0
to {1}1. Using the above interpretation of Omega* we can construct a
hypergraph morphism gamma! : H -> Omega*. I don't have a neat
construction for gamma! except via the above interpretation of Omega*.
Now the endomorphism neg : Omega -> Omega dualizes to
neg* : Omega* -> Omega* and we compose this with gamma! to
get a hypergraph morphism from H to Omega* which represents suppl gamma.
