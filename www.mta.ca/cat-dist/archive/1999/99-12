*-Autonomous categories: once more around the track

Michael Barr

 This represents a new and more comprehensive approach to the
*-autonomous categories constructed in the monograph [Barr, 1979].
The main tool in the new approach is the Chu construction.  The main
conclusion is that the category of separated extensional Chu objects for
certain kinds of equational categories is equivalent to two usually
distinct subcategories of the categories of uniform algebras of those
categories.

A bicategorical approach to static modules

Renato Betti

The purpose of this paper is to indicate some bicategorical 
properties of ring theory. In this interaction, static modules are analyzed.

The categorical theory of self-similarity

Peter Hines

We demonstrate how the identity $N\otimes N \cong N$ in a monoidal
category allows us to construct a functor from the full subcategory
generated by $N$ and $\otimes$ to the endomorphism monoid of the object
$N$. This provides a categorical foundation for one-object analogues of
the symmetric monoidal categories used by J.-Y. Girard in his Geometry of
Interaction series of papers, and explicitly described in terms of inverse
semigroup theory in [6,11]. 

This functor also allows the construction of one-object analogues of other
categorical structures. We give the example of one-object analogues of the
categorical trace, and compact closedness. Finally, we demonstrate how the
categorical theory of self-similarity can be related to the algebraic
theory (as presented in [11]), and Girard's dynamical algebra, by
considering one-object analogues of projections and inclusions.

A Note on Rewriting Theory for Uniqueness of Iteration

M. Okada and P. J. Scott

Uniqueness for higher type term constructors in lambda calculi (e.g. 
surjective pairing for product types, or uniqueness of iterators on the
natural numbers) is easily expressed using universally quantified
conditional equations.  We use a technique of Lambek [18] involving
Mal'cev operators to equationally express uniqueness of iteration (more
generally, higher-order primitive recursion) in a simply typed lambda
calculus, essentially Godel's T [29,13].  We prove the following facts
about typed lambda calculus with uniqueness for primitive recursors:  
(i)  It is undecidable, (ii)  Church-Rosser fails, although ground
Church-Rosser holds, (iii) strong normalization (termination) is still
valid.  This entails the undecidability of the coherence problem for
cartesian closed categories with strong natural numbers objects, as well
as providing a natural example of the following computational paradigm:  a
non-CR, ground CR, undecidable, terminating rewriting system.

Contravariant Functors on Finite Sets and Stirling Numbers

Robert Pare

Contravariant Functors on Finite Sets and Stirling Numbers We characterize
the numerical functions which arise as the cardinalities of contravariant
functors on finite sets, as those which have a series expansion in terms
of Stirling functions. We give a procedure for calculating the
coefficients in such series and a concrete test for determining whether a
function is of this type. A number of examples are considered.

Comparing coequalizer and exact completions

M. C. Pedicchio and J. Rosicky

We characterize when the coequalizer and the exact completion of a
category $\cal C$ with finite sums and weak finite limits coincide.

Enriched Lawvere theories

John Power

We define the notion of enriched Lawvere theory, for enrichment over a
monoidal biclosed category $V$ that is locally finitely presentable as a
closed category. We prove that the category of enriched Lawvere theories
is equivalent to the category of finitary monads on $V$.  Moreover, the
$V$-category of models of a Lawvere $V$-theory is equivalent to the
$V$-category of algebras for the corresponding $V$-monad. This all extends
routinely to local presentability with respect to any regular cardinal. We
finally consider the special case where $V$ is $Cat$, and explain how the
correspondence extends to pseudo maps of algebras.

Epimorphic regular contexts

Robert Raphael

A von Neumann regular extension of a semiprime ring naturally defines a
epimorphic extension in the category of rings.  These are studied, and
four natural examples are considered, two in commutative ring theory, and
two in rings of continuous functions.

Natural deduction and coherence for non-symmetric linearly 
distributive categories

Robert R. Schneck

In this paper certain proof-theoretic techniques of [BCST] are applied to
non-symmetric linearly distributive categories, corresponding to
non-commutative negation-free multiplicative linear logic (mLL).  First,
the correctness criterion for the two-sided proof nets developed in [BCST]
is adjusted to work in the non-commutative setting.  Second, these proof
nets are used to represent morphisms in a (non-symmetric) linearly
distributive category; a notion of proof-net equivalence is developed
which permits a considerable sharpening of the previous coherence results
concerning these categories, including a decision procedure for the
equality of maps when there is a certain restriction on the units.  In
particular a decision procedure is obtained for the equivalence of proofs
in non-commutative negation-free mLL without non-logical axioms.

Workshop on 

Algebraic K-theory, algebraic homotopy, and global actions

Mathematics Division,
School of Informatics, 
University of Wales, Bangor

January 4-12, 2000

This workshop is the next in a series of Bangor/Bielefeld workshops which
have formed part of a British Council/ARC programme in collaboration with
Prof A Bak (Bielefeld). Colleagues outside Bangor/Bielefeld are welcome to
participate at their own costs. 

The matters for lectures and discussion will include the following
and their interactions

(i)   Global actions and groupoid atlases
(ii)  Homotopy limits and colimits
(iii) Generalised dimension theory for categories
(iv)  Related topics

Background

Bak's theory of Global Actions gives a framework for an algebraic approach
to higher Algebraic K-theory, and in fact has more general applications.
This framework has been generalised in joint work with Bangor to the
notion of Groupoid Atlas. There have emerged from previous workshops links
between single domain global actions and recent work in Geometric Group
Theory, including complexes of groups, higher generation by subgroups, and
identities among relations for presentations.

SCOPE

Both deduction systems and computer algebra systems are receiving
growing attention from industry and academia. On the one hand,
mathematical software systems have been commercially very
successful. Their use is now wide-spread in industry, education, and
scientific contexts. On the other hand, the use of formal methods in
hardware and software development has made deduction systems
indispensable not least because of the complexity and sheer size of
the reasoning tasks involved.  As many application domains fall
outside the scope of existing deduction systems and computer algebra
systems, there is still need for improvement and in particular need
for the integration of computer algebra and deduction systems.

The symposium is intended for researchers and developers interested in
combining the reasoning capabilities of deduction systems and the
computational power of computer algebra systems.


TOPICS 

Topics of interest for the symposium include all aspects related to the
combination of deduction systems and computer algebra systems. We
explicitly encourage submissions of results from applications and case
studies where such integration results are particularly important.


FORMAT

The symposium will feature invited talks, contributed presentations
with ample time for discussion, and a panel session.

Consistent with the tradition of the symposium as a lively forum for
discussing controversial ideas, we expect and encourage contributed
talks to present work in progress, rather than polished final results.


INVITED SPEAKERS

- Henk Barendregt, U. Nijmegen, Mathematics and Computer Science
- Arjeh Cohen, Eindhoven University of Technology, Dept. Math. 
- Gaston Gonnet, ETH Z"urich, Institute for Scientific Computation
  

SUBMISSION

Authors are invited to submit papers in the following categories: 

- Full papers up to 15 pages describing original results not
  published elsewhere.
- System descriptions of up to 5 pages describing new systems or
  significant upgrades of existing ones, especially including
  experiments.

Details of the submission format will be available from the web page
(see top) closer to the deadline.

Authors of accepted full papers and system descriptions are expected
to present their contribution at the symposium. Authors of system
descriptions are expected to demonstrate their systems.

The symposium will have published proceedings, the organizers are
currently negotiating with major publishers. The results and details
will be published at the web page together with the submission
specification.

Title : Combinatorics of branchings in higher dimensional automata

Abstract :

We explore the combinatorial properties of the branching areas of 
paths in higher dimensional automata. Mathematically, this means 
that we investigate the combinatorics of the negative corner homology 
of a globular $\omega$-category and the combinatorics of a new homology 
theory called the reduced negative corner homology. This latter is the 
homology of the quotient of the corner complex by the sub-complex 
generated by its thin elements. As application, we calculate the corner 
homology of some $\omega$-categories and we give some invariance results 
for the reduced corner homology. We only treat the negative side. The 
positive side, that is to say the case of merging areas of paths is 
similar and can be easily deduced from the negative side.

                  Realizability Semantics and Applications

       Editors: L. Birkedal, J. van Oosten, G. Rosolini, D.S. Scott


There has been recently a reawaking of interest in many aspects of
realizability interpretations -- especially as regards semantics of type
theories for constructive reasoning and semantics of programming languages.
But, the details of realizability can be quite technical, and therefore a
tutorial workshop on realizability and appliations was held in
June/July 1999 in Trento, Italy.  The workshop contained both tutorial
lectures and also contributed research talks, see 
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/birkedal/www/realizability-workshop/
for an overview.  

A special issue of the journal Mathematical Structures in Computer Science
(MSCS) will be devoted to papers on realizability semantics and
applications.  The volume will contain the tutorial presentations given by
invited speakers at the realizability workshop in Trento, see 
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/birkedal/www/realizability-workshop/
for an overview. We now also solicit contributions of research papers
on realizability and applications for the special MSCS volume.
Everyone is invited to contribute a paper (i.e., not only researchers
who contributed a paper to the realizability workshop).  Papers will
be refereed to the usual high standards of MSCS.

Instruction to Authors

Authors are invited to submit full original research papers. Papers
should be submitted via email to wr99@athena.disi.unige.it as a postscript
file, or by mailing a hard copy to

Background

MFCSIT2000 is the first conference to be held in Ireland with a focus on
mathematical and foundational issues arising out of Computer Science and IT.
There has been a very significant increase in Ireland over the last few
years in 
activities relating to the production of software and hardware by some of
the major
computer manufacturers. This conference is intended to be a forum for
discussion
of related theoretical questions.

Topics

The intended coverage of the conference includes: Semantics of Procedural
and Declarative Programming Languages, Logic in Computer Science,
Categorical and Topological aspects of Computer Science, Computer
Algebra Systems in Mathematics, Number Theory in Computer Science.
Especially welcome are papers which broadly relate to the interests of the
main speakers and which therefore fall into one or other of two main themes:
(i) Mathematical Foundations of Computational Logic and Artificial
Intelligence,
and Categorical, Domain-Theoretic and Topological Methods in Computer Science,
(ii) Computer Algebra Systems in Mathematics. 

Invited Speakers

Confirmed main speakers are
   Abbas Edalat (Imperial College)
   Dick Hamlet (University of Portland, Oregon)
   Giorgio Levi (University of Pisa)
   Dana Scott (Carnegie Mellon University)
   
Steering Committee

James Bowen (NUI, Cork), Ted Hurley (NUI, Galway), Micheal MacanAirchinnigh
(Trinity College, Dublin), Michel Schellekens (NUI, Cork), Anthony K.
Seda (NUI, Cork)

Programme Co-Chairs

Ted Hurley (NUI, Galway) and Anthony K. Seda (NUI, Cork)
   
Publication of Proceedings

Papers will be refereed, and it is expected that the Conference proceedings
(or a selection thereof) will appear as a volume in ENTCS, Elsevier's series
"Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science".

Mathematicians:

Below is an advertisement for Postgraduate Fellowships in memory of 
Scott Russell Johnson.

I should explain what the ad really means.  For those people without 
permanent residency in Australia, Macquarie University charges fees 
in the order of $16000 per year for enrolment in a PhD program. 
There are a few scholarships at Macquarie available to cover those 
fees but the rules for those (and the conventions followed by the 
committee) make it hard for a standard good student with an excellent 
undergraduate record (or even with a Masters degree) to get one.

For a person with permanent residency and a good record (equivalent 
of First Class Honours in our system), there are generally enough 
Australian Postgraduate Awards (APAs) to go around. An APA pays a 
living allowance of around $17000 per year tax free (it lasts 3 years 
subject to performance and is rarely extended much beyond that).

What we are trying to do with the SRJ Memorial Scholarship is two-fold:
	(1) given that an overseas student has paid the Macquarie 
fees, this Scholarship will provide $15000 towards a living allowance;
	(2) for Australian students, this Scholarship will supplement 
the APA with an extra $5000 per annum.
We cannot afford very many of these scholarships at one time, so they 
are competitive.

All postgraduate students are able to get a little extra from 
tutoring or assignment marking. Overseas students may also be able to 
obtain a supplement of around $3000 per annum from our Department.

Regards,
Ross

----------------   FIRST CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS    -----------------

                             Workshop on
         Graph Transformation and Visual Modeling Techniques
                   <http://www.di.unipi.it/GT-VMT/>

                         Geneva, Switzerland
                       Saturday July 15, 2000

                   A Satellite Event of ICALP'2000
                    <http://cui.unige.ch/~icalp/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE WORKSHOP

Visual modelling techniques provide an intuitive, yet precise way in
order to express and reason about concepts at their natural level of
abstraction.  The success of visual techniques in computer science and
engineering resulted in a variety of methods and notations addressing
different application domains and different phases of the development
process.  Diagrammatic languages are used, for example, during
requirement specification in order to support the communication
between developers and customers; but also for describing the
architecture of systems and as high-level visual programming
languages.

However, despite the wide-spread usage of visual modelling techniques
there is a lack of well-understood (and integrated) methodologies for
defining their syntax and semantics.  Until now, there exists no
equivalent to Backus-Naur-Form which would be the notation for
defining the syntax of a visual language. The same applies to type
systems, deductive proof methods, operational or denotational
semantics for visual modelling techniques. In fact, the situation
could be compared with the state-of-the-art in programming languages
about thirty years ago when the definition and implementation of
languages was an ad-hoc task, and formal semantics was an exception
rather than the rule.

The workshop aims at bringing together scientists and researchers
interested in discussing formal methodologies for the definition of
syntax and semantics of visual modelling techniques.  All aspects of
this problem are of potential interest ranging from the concrete
syntax defined, for example, by Constraint Grammars or Picture Layout
Grammars, the abstract syntax specified by means of Meta Modelling or
Graph Grammars, and the semantics of visual modelling techniques
given, e.g., in terms of Graph Transformation, Process Algebra,
Abstract State Machines, Type Theory, Logic, etc.  In particular, we
believe that Graph Grammars and Graph Transformation may play a
central role in the definition of visual modelling techniques because
they provide the graphical analogous to Chomsky Grammars and Term
Rewriting which are widely used for defining the syntax and semantics
of textual languages.

CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of up to 5 (five) A4
pages.  The contributions should report about ongoing research in the
area of graph transformation and visual modelling techniques,
especially on the syntax and semantics of visual languages according
to the scope and objectives of the workshop. Contributions exploring
the use of Graph Grammars and Graph Transformation Systems are
particularly welcome, as well as papers which cover several aspects or
integrate different formalisms for the definition of visual modelling
techniques. Position papers and contributions making methodological
statements are strongly encouraged. Submissions should be sent
preferably in postscript format to the address <andrea@di.unipi.it>
(Andrea Corradini) before the submission deadline. In the case
electronic submission is not possible, three copies should be sent 
to the address:

SCOPE The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers and students in order to advance the theory of
concurrency, and promote its applications. Interest in this topic is
continuously growing, as a consequence of the importance and ubiquity
of concurrent systems and their applications, and of the scientific
relevance of their foundations. Submissions are solicited in all areas
of semantics, logics and verification techniques for concurrent
systems.

Topics include (but are not limited to) concurrency related aspects
of: models of computation and semantic domains, process algebras,
Petri nets, event structures, real-time systems, hybrid systems,
decidability, model-checking, verification techniques, refinement
techniques, term and graph rewriting, distributed programming, logic
constraint programming, object-oriented programming, typing systems
and algorithms, case studies, tools and environments for programming
and verification.

Hello all,

I believe someone said, at the 1994 conference on Category Theory and Universal
Algebra, that there was a category-theoretic generalization of the modular
commutator.  Can someone give me a reference about this?

I've been looking at the Proceedings of the Second Workshop on
Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science (CMCS'99), Electronic Notes in
Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 19, to be found at

  www.elsevier.nl:80/cas/tree/store/tcs/free/noncas/pc/menu.htm

There's a nice paper by Dusko Pavlovic and Vaughan Pratt. It's
entitled On Coalgebra of Real Numbers and it has turned me on. Their
abstract begins:

  We define the continuum up to order isomorphism (and hence
  homeomorphism) as the final coalgebra of the functor  X x omega,
  ordinal product with omega. This makes an attractive analogy with
  the definition of the ordinal omega itself as the initial algebra of
  the functor  1;X, prepend unity, with both definitions made in the
  category of posets.

I thought of using another functor. And damned if it isn't just what
I should have had for my CTCS talk last September at Edinburgh.

In the category of posets with top and bottom consider the binary
functor, X v Y, obtained by starting with the disjoint union  X;Y,
with everything in  X  ordered below  Y,  and then identifying the 
top of  X  with the bottom of  Y.  The functor  X v X  preserves the 
terminator (the one-element poset) hence the terminator is its final
coalgebra. So restrict to the category of posets with _distinct_ top
and bottom. The functor  X v X  again has a final coalgebra: this time
it's the closed interval, I.  (For Dusko and Vaughan's functor it's 
the half-open interval. For yet another functor, one that ought to
have the open interval as its final coalgebra, but doesn't, see PS
below.)

If  X v Y  is described as the subobject of the product  X x Y
consisting of those pairs  <x,y>  such that either  x  is top or  y 
is bottom, then a coalgebra structure for  X v X  can be described as 
a pair of endo-functions  d,u  such that for each  x  either  d(x)
is top or  u(x)  is bottom. On the interval  [a,b]  the 
final-coalgebra structure is understood to be given by 
d(x) = min (b, 2x - a)  and  u(x) = max (a, 2x - b).

In fact, we didn't need to start in the category of posets. It would
have sufficed to work in the category of sets with distinct top and
bottom (see PPS below for a proof). The final coalgebra is still the
closed interval and, yes, the ordering is implicit: it is the most 
inclusive relation preserved by  d  and  u  that avoids placing top 
below bottom. (It can also be obtained by constructing either of the 
two lattice operations on  I  as the unique coalgebra map  I x I --> I
for an appropriately chosen coalgebra structure on  I x I.  A similar 
construction works for the Pavlovic-Pratt coalgebra.)

Indeed, all of the structure of the closed interval is definable from
this coalgebra definition. Go back to the category of posets with 
distinct top and bottom. It is routine to verify that  X v X  commutes
with the opposite-poset functor hence -- using the fact that that 
functor is an equivalence -- its final coalgebra will be invariant
under that functor. That is, there is an isomorphism from  I  to its
opposite.

It takes more work, but not an infinite amount, to construct a 
coalgebra structure on  I x I  so that the induced binary operation 
I x I --> I  is the midpoint operation, the values of which will be
denoted here as  x|y.  It is pretty much characterized by the 
equations: idempotence, x|x = x; commutativity, x|y = y|x; and middle-
two-interchange, (u|v)|(x|y) = (u|x)|(v|y); together with cancelation:
a|x = a|y  =>  x = y.  If one chooses a zero, then one may prove that
there's an ambient abelian group with unique division by  2, such that 
the given midpoint algebra is a subset closed under the operation
x|y = (x + y)/2.  (There must be an existent reference for this.) 

Actually we want that ambient abelian group for  I;  it's none other
than the reals. The order-duality makes its construction easier than 
in the general case. So let's use  1  to denote the top of the final
coalgebra, I, -1  for the bottom, and  0  for their midpoint, -1|1.
Let  h:I -> I  denote the "halving" map that sends  x  to  0|x.  Note
that  h  is an endomorphism with respect to  0, the ordering, the 
duality, the midpoint structure (and not, of course, the top and 
bottom). For a moment enter the category of endomorphisms, and reflect
the object  <I, h>  into the full subcategory of automorphisms. (The 
reflection may be explicitly constructed as the colimit of the diagram
   h     h     h
I --> I --> I -->...)  The result is a poset-with-0-and-duality-and-
midpoint-operation we'll denote as  R.  The midpoint operation 
respects the order and commutes with duality.  0  is self-dual. By
making  h  an automorphism we know that for all  y  there is a unique
x  such that  0|x = y.  On  R  define  a + b  by the equation
0|(a + b) = a|b  and verify  0 + b = b = b + 0  and 
(a + b) + (c + d) = (a + c) + (b + d).  Use the duality to define  -a
and verify  (-a) + a = 0.  Use  h  to define  a/2  and verify 
a/2 + a/2 = a.  All of this makes  R  an abelian group with unique
division by  2.

Viewing  R  as an ordered abelian group it is easy to verify that any
endomorphism is determined by where it sends  1  (inherited from 
I -> R).  That, of course, allows us to define the multiplication.

Those who heard my CTCS talk last September at Edinburgh, "Path 
Integrals, Bayesian Vision, and Is Gaussian Quadrature Really Good?",
(there's an abstract at the same website as above) can appreciate why 
I'm particularly happy. I started by defining ordinary integration of
continuous functions using -- without knowing it -- this coalgebra
structure on  I.  Let  C  be the functor that assigns to a space  X
the set, C(X), of continuous real-valued functions on  X.  The 
"mean-value" function  M:C(I) -> R  can be characterized -- indeed,
evaluated -- from its order-preservation together with what it does to
constant functions and
                                                MxM
         C(I v I) -->  C(I + I) --> C(I) x C(I) ---> R x R
  
        C(F) |                                         | m
             v                                         v         
                                 M
          C(I)  ------------------------------------>  R

where  F:I -> I v I  is the coalgebra structure and  m  is the
midpoint operation. If  C(F)  is inverted then this diagram can be 
read as a fixed-point definition of  M.  (It's the unique fixed-point 
of an operator acting on the set of all those order-preserving maps 
from  C(I)  to  R  that do the right thing on constant functions.)


PS
Just for comparison, consider the category of posets and the functor
that sends  X  to  X;1;X.  The open interval is an invariant object 
for this functor but it is not the final coalgebra. For that we need
-- as we called it in Cats and Alligators -- Wilson space. Actually,
not the space but the linearly ordered set, most easily defined as the
lexicographically ordered subset, W, of sequences with values in  
{-1, 0, 1}  consisting of all those sequences such that for all  n 
a(n) = 0  =>  a(n+1) = 0  (take a finite word on  {-1,1}  and pad it
out to an infinite sequence by tacking on  0s).

PPS
Given a coalgebra structure described by endo-functions  d  and  u  on
X, let  End(X)  be the monoid of endo-functions on  X.  We will need 
to compose in the diagrammatic order: "ud" means "first  u  then  d".
Let  {0,1}*  be the free monoid with generators named  0  and  1  and
Let  M_X:{0,1}* --> End(X)  be the monoid homomorphism such that  
M_X(0) = d  and  M_X(1) = u.  Given  x  in  X  let  L  be the subset of 
{0,1}*  consisting of those words  w  such that  M_X(w)  sends  x  to
top in  X.  The elements of  {0,1}*  may, of course, be  viewed as
finite words on  0  and  1.  By catenating  "0."  on the left of any
such word we obtain a description -- in binary -- of a dyadic rational
in the half-open unit interval  [0,1).  Define  f:X -> I  by sending
each  x  to the supremum in  [0,1]  of the dyadic rationals, r(L),
named by the words in its corresponding  L.  The  L  corresponding to
d(x)  can thus be obtained by taking each word in  L  that starts with
0  and deleting that  0.  The resulting  r(L)  can be described by
first throwing away each dyadic rational bounded below by  1/2  and
then doubling each dyadic rational that remains, that is,doubling each
dyadic rational bounded above by both  f(x)  and  1/2.  The resulting 
supremum is thus  min (1, 2f(x)).  That's what  f(d(x))  is. And it's 
also what d(f(x)) is. Same sort of argument for  u.

A little too easy. The recipe above does work for  f  but the proof 
that it works requires work. Note that the above argument requires --
among other things -- that  r(L)  be a downdeal. (And note that it 
never invoked the facts that  d  and  u  preserve top and bottom nor 
the fact that  d(x)  is top or  u(x)  is bottom for all  x.)  I think 
a  return to Dedekind works best. Besides defining the "lower" set, L, 
define the "upper" set  U  as the subset of  {0,1}*  consisting of 
those words  w  such that  M_X(w)  sends  x  to bottom. We have the
facts:
              w:L  =>  w0:L  and  w1:L            (using 
              w:U  =>  w0:U  and  w1:U              ":"
         w:{0,1}*  =>  w0:L  or   w1:U        for membership)

We may infer, just from  w:L => w0:L  and  w:U => w0:U, that if a
dyadic rational has a name in either  L  or  U  then it does not have
a name in the other. Thus we obtain a disjoint pair of sets of dyadic
rationals  r(L)  and  r(U).  For any pair of dyadic rationals 
x,y:[0,1)  where  x is _not_ in  r(L)  and  x < y,  it is the case 
that  y  is in  r(U):  it suffices to check, for any word  w, that if
w0  can be prolonged to a name of  x, then  w0  is not in  L  forcing
w1  to be in  U  and, hence, any prolongation of  w1  to be in  U.  It 
follows that  r(U)  is an updeal and if there's a dyadic rational in
[0,1)  that is in neither  r(U)  nor  r(L)  then there's only one such
dyadic rational, to wit, the greatest lower bound of  r(U).  It
follows that  r(L)  is a downdeal. The pair  r(L)  and  r(U)  thus
forms a Dedekind cut and we can use it to name the value of  f(x). 
The compatibility with  d  and  u  is a straightforward computation.

For uniqueness, first verify that for every pair  a < b  in  I  
there's a word  w:{0,1}*  such that  M_I(w)  sends  a  to bottom and
b  to top. If  f,f':X -> I  were both coalgebra maps, and  x:X  were
such that  f(x) < f'(x)  let  w  be as described. Note that  M_I(w0) =
M_I(w) = M_I(w1).  But either M_X(w0)  sends  x  to top or  M_X(w1)  
sends  x  to bottom. The first case contradicts that  M_I(w0)  sends
f(x)  to bottom. The second case contradicts that  M_I(w1)  sends
f'(x)  to top.

Apropos of Peter's kind remarks, the journal version of our paper
should be in TCS soon, entitled The continuum as a final coalgebra.
Meanwhile it's on the web as

        http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/continuum.ps.gz

Abstract:
We define the continuum up to order isomorphism, and hence up to
homeomorphism via the order topology, in terms of the final coalgebra
of either the functor NxX, product with the set of natural numbers, or
the functor 1 + NxX.  This makes an attractive analogy with the
definition of N itself as the initial algebra of the functor 1 + X,
disjoint union with a singleton.  We similarly specify Baire space and
Cantor space in terms of these final coalgebras.  We identify two
variants of this approach, a coinductive definition based on final
coalgebraic structure in the category of sets, and a direct definition
as a final coalgebra in the category of posets.  We conclude with some
paradoxical discrepancies between continuity and constructiveness in
this setting.


PF>So restrict to the category of posets with _distinct_ top and bottom.

...which has no final object, making the following all the nicer:

PF>The functor  X v X  again has a final coalgebra:

The bipointed-set version of this seems like *the* right way to generate
the topology of the continuum.  Verry nice.

PF>PS
PF>Just for comparison, consider the category of posets and the functor
PF>that sends  X  to  X;1;X.  The open interval is an invariant object 
PF>for this functor but it is not the final coalgebra. For that we need
PF>-- as we called it in Cats and Alligators -- Wilson space. Actually,
PF>not the space but the linearly ordered set, most easily defined as the
PF>lexicographically ordered subset, W, of sequences with values in  
PF>{-1, 0, 1}  consisting of all those sequences such that for all  n 
PF>a(n) = 0  =>  a(n+1) = 0  (take a finite word on  {-1,1}  and pad it
PF>out to an infinite sequence by tacking on  0s).

In other words the continuum plus *two* additional copies of each rational
(as opposed to Cantor space's one additional copy).

PF>It takes more work, but not an infinite amount, to construct a 
PF>coalgebra structure on  I x I  so that the induced binary operation 
PF>I x I --> I  is the midpoint operation, the values of which will be
PF>denoted here as  x|y.  It is pretty much characterized by the 
PF>equations: idempotence, x|x = x; commutativity, x|y = y|x; and middle-
PF>two-interchange, (u|v)|(x|y) = (u|x)|(v|y); together with cancelation:
PF>a|x = a|y  =>  x = y.  If one chooses a zero, then one may prove that
PF>there's an ambient abelian group with unique division by  2, such that 
PF>the given midpoint algebra is a subset closed under the operation
PF>x|y = (x + y)/2.  (There must be an existent reference for this.) 

Here I should be understood as [-1,1].  Peter's implicit definition
of this coalgebra structure on I x I has the following equivalent
five-equation explicit definition (or seven if you count each of (3)
and (4) as two equations).  My apologies to anyone reading this with a
variable-width font.

                  x + y        y + x
(1)               -----    =   -----
                    2            2

                  0 + 0
(2)               -----    =   0
                    2
                                   
                xo1            x + t
                --- + 0        -----o1    where the 2 o's are + and t is -1
(3)              2         =     2           or the 2 o's are - and t is 1
                --------       -------    (o = operator, t = terminator)
                    2             2

               xo1   yo1       x + y
               --- + ---       -----o1       where the 3 o's are either
(4)             2     2    =     2             all - or all +
                -------        -------
                   2              2

                x-1   y+1      x + y
                --- + ---      ----- + 0
(5)              2     2   =     2
                 -------       ---------
                    2              2

All these equations clearly hold on I; the question is, what is their
content?  Well, spacing around + and - is significant: without a space the form
x-1        x+1
--- (resp. --- )  denotes a non-middle (nonzero) element of I which when
 2          2
represented as a string over {-1,0,1} has head -1 (resp. 1) and tail x,
                            x + y
while with a space the form ----- denotes a pair (x,y) of I x I.
                              2
Finally, if -1, 0, or 1 (which includes t) are preceded by a space then
they denote the respective infinite constant sequences -1,-1,-1,... or
0,0,0,.. or 1,1,1... (each of which has that constant as its value).
(Once a sequence hits a zero it stays zero.)

The left hand side always has exactly one spaced +, and at the outermost
level, since that's what we're trying to define.  On the right hand
side, each occurrence of a spaced + denotes a corecursive call (so two
corecursive calls in the last equation --- it might seem like a lot of
bother to do a corecursive call merely to add 0, but the real point of
the second call is of course to divide the result of the first call by 2,
which we can do by taking the mean with 0.)

Equation (1) merely ensures that any pair (x,y) will match the left
hand side of one of (2)-(5) one way round or the other.  Equations
(2)-(4) provide instant gratification inasmuch as they allow immediate
production of the first "trit" (ternary digit) of the mean of x and y
given only the first trit of each of them, thereby explicitly defining
the desired coalgebra structure on I x I.  But if you hit equation (5)
you may be in for a long or even infinite wait (consider taking the mean
of -1,1,-1,1,...  (= -2/3) with 1,-1,1,-1,... (= 2/3), which to us is
obviously zero but not so obviously to equation (5)).  So equation (5)
does not give the coalgebra structure at this part of I x I explicitly,
one must regrettably deduce it by corecursion.

The continuum is intrinsically geometrical, so it is a shame to specify
Peter's midpoint coalgebra on IxI with a mess of algebraic-looking
equations as per my previous message when it has a relatively short and
transparent geometric specification.  (I must have got this idea from
the paper on higher dimensional automata that I'm just finishing up.)

Incidentally there were two ambiguities in my equations, arising from
respectively equations (1) and (5).  I was going to offer fixes for
these, but one of the degeneracies that made these ambiguities possible
in the first place (that with (5)) does not even arise in the geometric
presentation, while the other, arising with (1), is just as readily
dealt with geometrically as algebraically.

In the following I'll refer to this coalgebra as Fm for Freyd's midpoint
(unrelated to Scott's bottom).  (For listeners who just tuned in to Fm,
its role is to promote the final coalgebra I of Peter's fusion functor
X v X from a linear order, and hence a topological space via the order
topology, to a metric space understood as the real interval [-1,1].
It does this by furnishing IxI with a coalgebra, which determines a
unique coalgebra homomorphism from IxI to I, I being the final coalgebra.
This homomorphism is then taken to be (x+y)/2, while the endpoints of
I are taken to be -1 and 1, thereby uniquely determining a continuous
metric on I qua topological space.)

For both the equational and geometric specifications, here's what the
domain and codomain of Fm look like.


                                                    (1,1)
                IxI                                   ^
                                                     / \
                                                    /   \
                (1,1)                        (1,-1)<  1  >(-1,1)
                 /\                                 \   /
                /  \                Fm               \ /
         (1,-1)<    >(-1,1)   ------------->          0      IxI v IxI
                \  /                                 / \
                 \/                                 /   \
              (-1,-1)                        (1,-1)< -1  >(-1,1)
                                                    \   /
                                                     \ /
                                                      V
                                                   (-1,-1)

So Fm maps pairs of the form (x,-x) to 0 (where the two copies of IxI
are fused) and all other pairs (x,y) to a pair (h,(x',y')) whose head h
specifies which copy of IxI to land in, 1 for upper and -1 for lower, and
(x',y') gives the landing point within that copy.  Here -1 <= x,y,x',y' <= 1, 
-x is defined by changing all the signs on the sequence representing x
and h is unproblematically determined by whether (x,y) is in the upper
or lower half of IxI oriented as shown.  The tricky part is to specify x'
and y' reasonably.

(Although it is convenient to think of x and y as reals in [1,-1], at
this stage they are merely infinite sequences over {-1,0,1} with the
properties that once zero alway zero and infinite runs of -1 or 1 are
only allowed in constant sequences.)

The domain of Fm, namely I x I, can be blown up as


			    (1,1)
			     /\
			    /  \
			 (1,0) (0,1)
			  / \  / \
			 /   \/   \
		  (1,-1)<   (0,0)  >(-1,1)
			 \   /\   /
			  \ /  \ /
			(0,-1)  (0,1)
			    \  /
			     \/
			  (-1,-1)


In my previous mess-age, my five equations implicitly decomposed this
domain into nine regions, namely the midpoint (0,0) (equation (2)), the
four lines leading out of it (equation (3)), the upper and lower diamonds
(equation (4)), and the left and right diamonds (equation (5)).

For the geometric description of Fm, a simpler decomposition suffices,
namely three regions: the upper and lower diamonds as one region, call
it M for Middle, and the interior of each side diamond along with its
outer sides, call them L and R.  (So M is closed and L + R = IxI - M.)


			       (1,1)
				/\
			       /  \
	       .            (1,0) (0,1)          .
	      / .              \  /             . \
	     /   .              \/             .   \
      (1,-1)<  L  .         M  (0,0)          .  R  >(-1,1)
	     \   .              /\             .   /
	      \ .              /  \             . /
	       .           (0,-1)  (0,1)         .
			       \  /
				\/
			     (-1,-1)


In addition we need one more region, S for Shrunk, as a subregion of
IxI v IxI, shown below.  S is simply IxI v IxI shrunk in half (or pushed
twice as far away).

                                /\
                               /  \
                              /    \
                             /      \
                             \  /\  /
                              \/S \/
                               \  /
                                \/     IxI v IxI
                                /\
                               /  \
                              /\ S/\
                             /  \/  \
                             \      /
                              \    /
                               \  /
                                \/


We now describe Fm as follows.  Its restriction to M is the evident
similarity between M and IxI v IxI.  And its restriction to each of L
and R lands in S, and in each case is the whole of Fm shrunk in half
(the corecursion is essential, not even geometry can eliminate it).

Note that these maps are defined on sequences, i.e. we are not assuming
the metric we set out to construct.

Fm as defined is not commutative, but can be made so by composing its
restriction to L with commutativity of (x+y)/2, viz. reflection of L about
its central vertical axis, thereby symmetrizing Fm.  (This commutativity
ambiguity also arose via equation (1) of my 5-equation approach.)
This symmetrical Fm would appear to be the canonical choice for Freyd's
midpoint coalgebra.  (The apparent competitor obtained by reflecting
R instead of L is slightly more discontinuous, if that's a reasonable
tie breaker.)

This coalgebra is of course not final, nor is it even injective, though
it is surjective, witness subdomain M.  It is also not continuous:
points near (1,0) in L go to points near (1,(0,0)) in IxI v IxI, while
points near (1,0) in M go to points near (1,(1,-1)) in IxI x IxI.
On the other hand points near (1/2,0) in both M and L.M (the M of L)
go to points near (1/2,0) in IxI v IxI, which has no counterpart in the
above-mentioned competitor.

Question.  Is there a corecursively defined Freyd midpoint coalgebra
that is continuous?

(x,y) |--> ((x+y)/2,(x+y)/2) (projection onto the center axis) is a
continuous midpoint coalgebra, but that assumes the metric before we've
defined it.  What corecursion would define this?

It could well be that Vaughan and I are defining the midpoint structure
in the same way. Here's how I described it (using the conventions from
my last posting).

Let  F:I --> I v I  be a final coalgebra. We will denote the top of  I
as  T  and the bottom as  B.  Construct the "halving" map,  h:I --> I,
(on  [-1,1]  it will send  x  to  x/2)  as:  

                   T v F v B             F'v F'        F'
    I --> 1 v I v 1 ------> I v I v I v I ---> I v I  --> I

where  F' denotes the inverse of  F, and, by a little overloading, T
and  B  denote the maps constantly equal to  T  and  B.  The leftmost
map records the fact that the terminator is a unit for the 
ordered-wedge functor.

Let  g  be the endo-function on  I x I  defined recursively by:

    g<x,y> = if  dx = T  and  dy = T  then      <x,y>    else
             if  dx = T  and  uy = B  then  h(g(dx,uy>)  else
             if  ux = B  and  dy = T  then  h(g<ux,dy>)  else
             if  ux = B  and  uy = B  then      <x,y>.

The values of  g  lie in the first and third quadrants, that is, those
points such that either  dx = dy = T  or  ux = uy = B.  The two maps

           g       d x d                   g       u x u
    I x I --> I x I --> I x I  and  I x I --> I x I --> I x I  

give a coalgebra structure on  I x I.  The midpoint operation may be
defined as the induced map to the final coalgebra.

Yes, after changing g(dx,uy) to g(ux,dy) in line 2 of Peter's definition
of g and similarly for line 3 (otherwise g(dx,uy) simplifies to the
nonsensical g(T,B)) Peter and I have essentially the same coalgebra on
IxI, and exactly the same after some inessential permutations within
that definition.

While I rather like Peter's nonrecursive definition

                   T v F v B             F'v F'        F'
    I --> 1 v I v 1 ------> I v I v I v I ---> I v I  --> I

of the halving map  h:I --> I sending  x  to  x/2, it should be remarked
that the effect of this map as an operation on sequences is to preserve
the empty sequence, and for nonempty sequences simply to prepend a copy
of the leading digit, e.g. -++-+000... becomes --++-+000....  (This takes
the 3-symbol alphabet for Peter's number system to be {-,0,+}.)  In other
words, right shift by one with sign extension, a well-known realization
of halving.

Along the same lines, Peter's d and u maps shift the sequence left.
If d (resp. u) shifts a + (resp. -) off the left end, the result is
replaced by the constantly + (resp. -) sequence, i.e. "clamp overflow
to +1 (resp. -1)".

Although the interval [-1,1] goes naturally with Peter's final coalgebra,
it occurrs to me that a fragment of Conway's surreal numbers is perfectly
matched to it, namely the interval [-\omega,\omega] consisting of the real
line plus two endpoints.  With respect to the Conway story this can be
described as what Conway produces by day omega, modulo infinitesimals
(identify those surreals that are only infinitesimally far apart).
At no day does exactly the real line appear in Conway's scenario.
Prior to day omega only the finite binary rationals have appeared.
Day omega sees the sudden emergence of all the reals along with 1/omega
added to and subtracted from each rational, as well as -omega and omega.
Except for -omega and omega, the quotienting eliminates the 1/omega
perturbations, yielding exactly the real line plus endpoints.

Exactly the same quotienting happens with Peter's final coalgebra, whose
elements are representable as finite and infinite strings over {-,+}
(the 0 is eliminated by allowing strings to be finite; if you want all
strings to be infinite, put 0 back in the alphabet and use it to pad the
infinite strings to infinity).  For example ---+++++... and --+----...
are identified by both Conway and Freyd.  Using Peter's choice of [-1,1]
as the represented interval, these are both -1/4.  Using Conway's number
system, these are respectively -2 - 1/omega and -2 + 1/omega, which
with the identification I described above become -2.  

In Conway's setup the finite constant sequences are the integers, with
the empty sequence being 0 and counting being done in unary.  At the
first sign reversal the bits jump mysteriously from unary to binary, not
by fiat but as a surprising consequence of a definition of addition that
on the face of is so natural that you would not dream it could cause a
radix jump like that.

So both [-1,1] and [-omega,omega] each admit a natural final coalgebra
structure for Peter's functor, namely Peter's and Conway's respectively,
and I would be surprised to see a different final coalgebra in either
case that was as natural.  In contrast, Dusko and I exhibited a number
of more or less equally convincing final coalgebra structures on [0,1)
and [0,omega) for the functor product-with-omega, no one of which I
would be willing to call *the* right one.

Starting with the closed interval, regarded as an ordered midpoint
algebra with duality, what's the best way to get the reals? My
previous answer was first to reflect the midpoint algebra in the
subcategory of abelian groups and then define the multiplication via
monotonic endomorphisms. I think there's a more natural way.

First, a re-cap of the definitions. A midpoint operation is a binary 
operation, with values here denoted as  x|y,  satisfying:
idempotence, x|x = x; commutativity, x|y = y|x; 
middle-two-interchange, (u|v)|(x|y) = (u|x)|(v|y); and cancelation,
x|y = x|z  =>  y = z.  The closed interval is a totally ordered
midpoint algebra with anti-involution, with values here denoted as  
 -x.  It follows that there's a unique element of the form  (-x)|x.  
We'll call it the center.

The middle-two-interchange law is just what is needed to see that the
monoid of midpoint-endomorphisms is itself a midpoint algebra (where
the midpoint of  f  and  g  is defined pointwise: (f|g)(x) =
(fx)|(gx)).   If  f  and  g  are both order-preserving or both order-
reversing then it's easy to see that so is  f|g.  But we'll want all 
the _monotonic_ endomorphisms (the OED defines "monotonic" as "varying
in such a way that it either never increases or never decreases") and
there's no apparent reason to expect that monotonicity is preserved by
midpointing. The wonderful fact, though, is:

    Midpoint-preserving functions between intervals are monotonic.

(The axiom of choice yields  2^{2^N}  counterexamples if the interval
is replaced by the reals.)

It follows that a midpoint-preserving function is determined by
its values on any two points. The monoid of midpoint- and duality-
preserving endo-functions on a closed interval is naturally 
isomorphic (via evaluation at Top) to the closed interval. For the
entire reals use the stalk at the center of the germs of such 
functions.


PS
For a proof suppose that  f:[-1,1] --> [-K,K]  preserves midpoints and
duality. For any  x:[-1,1]  and dyadic rational  q  such that  
qx:[-1,1], we may uniquely identify  qx  using just midpoints and
duality, hence  f(qx) = qf(x).

Suppose that  f  is not monotonic.  We wish to reach a contradiction.
Let  u < v  and  x < y  in  [-1,1]  be such that  fu < fv  and  
fx > fy.  Define  a = (-u)|v  and  b = (-x)|y  to obtain  a,b > 0  
and  fb < 0 < fa.  Let  q > 0  be a dyadic rational such that
a/b - (fa)/(bK)  <  q  <  a/b  and define  c = (-qb)|a.  Let  r  be a 
dyadic rational such that  (2K)/(fa)  <  r  <  1/c.  Then  rc  is in 
[-1,1]  but  f(rc)  can not be in  [-K,K]  (because  fc > (fa)/2).

The theorem I stated doesn't say anything about preserving duality. So
let  g  be a midpoint-preserving function between intervals. Let  a  
be the dual of the value of  g  at the center. Then the function  
\x.a|(gx)  preserves the center and continues to preserve midpoints.
Since  -x  may be uniquely identified by  (-x)|x = 0  the preservation
of the center implies preservation of the duality and  \x.a|(gx)  is
monotonic. Since  \y.a|y  not only preserves but reflects the order,
we know that  g  is monotonic.
