                   MATHEMATICS OF PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION
                   -----------------------------------

                     http://www.di.uminho.pt/mpc2000
            
                             3--7 July, 2000

                         Ponte de Lima, Portugal


                             CALL FOR PAPERS


This conference aims to promote the development of mathematical principles
and techniques that are demonstrably useful and usable in the process of
constructing computer programs (whether implemented in hardware or software).
The focus of the conference is on techniques that combine precision with
concision, enabling programs to be constructed by formal calculation.
Within this theme, the scope of the conference is very diverse.
We welcome contributions to  programming methodology (for example, formal
methods for program specification and  transformation), to programming
paradigms (for example, generic programming techniques and type systems)
and to language design (for example, programming calculi and programming
language semantics).  Theoretical contributions are welcome provided their
relevance to program construction is evident; discussion of applications is
welcome provided the mathematical basis is evident.

A number of workshops will be organised in conjunction with the conference.


                            IMPORTANT DATES

Deadline for submission of papers:    3rd January, 2000
Notification of acceptance/rejection: 29th February, 2000
Final papers due:                     17th April, 2000

Full papers should be submitted in Postscript format by e-mail to reach
Roland Backhouse or Jose Oliveira by 3rd January, 2000.

While updating the bibliography for the third edition of Barr & Wells,
Category Theory for Computing Science, I discovered that I had no record of
a Category Theory and Computer Science conference for 1993, although they
are supposed to be held biennially and were held in 1989, 1991, 1995 and
1997.  This may only mean that no library in Ohio has a copy of the
proceedings.  Any information on this would be appreciated.

Subject: categories: "Universes" within ZFC
Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca
Precedence: bulk
Status: O
X-Status: 

        The following improves on remarks I made to some people at the
recent Buffalo meeting, and on the FOM e-mail list.

   	This is a step towards showing Grothendieck's method of universes for
algebraic geometry can be formalized nearly unchanged in ZFC, without the
further axiom asserting existence of Grothendieck universes. To any set of
sites (or ringed sites) we associate a "generating cardinal" k and consider
as universes the sets V(i) where i is a limit ordinal larger than k and k
not cofinal in i. ZFC proves every set is a member of such a "universe".
These universes are at least models of Zermelo set theory plus countable
replacement. So, for example, for any set S and finitary operation on S in
the universe, the closure of S under that operation is also in the universe.
This obviously suffices for most of Grothendieck's theorems in TOHOKU and
SGA. The only theorem that stands out as needing more is existence of
injectives in AB5 categories with generators. I will show these universes
suffice for that theorem, for the AB5 categories associated to those
(ringed) sites. The problem is simply to find bounds on the transfinite
inductions we use. But these are not as simple as I had thought.    

        For any site C we can construct a generator U for the category of
Abelian sheaves on C, which works no matter which universe of sets we use to
define the topos on C (assuming, of course, that C is in the universe). Any
of the standard constructions have this property. And U has a fixed poset of
subsheaves (up to equivalence as monics to U) also independent of the
universe of sets. The "generating cardinal" for C is the first infinite
cardinal greater than the number of subobjects of U. Actually we can make it
smaller by a slightly more complicated definition: We can take the first
infinite cardinal greater than the length of  any chain of subobjects of U
well ordered by inclusion.

        If we use a ringed site and modules over that  ring, then U depends
on both the site and the sheaf of rings, but it still does not depend on the
universe of sets.

	The generating cardinal for a set of (ringed) sites is the supremum of the
generating cardinals for each one.

        Suppose we have a set of sites, and it has generating cardinal k.
Let i be any limit ordinal larger than k and k not cofinal in i. We will use
"small" to mean "a member of V(i)." So "small" here does not mean "of small
enough cardinality". It means "of low enough rank". A small set can be
isomorphic to a non-small one.

	The key fact is that the axiom of replacement holds within V(i) for any
countable family of sets and for any family of sets indexed by k. That is,
any set of small sets which is the range of a function defined on k is
itself a small set. The reason is this: Consider any function f:k-->S where
S is a subset of V(i) but we do not assume f is small. Compose f with the
rank function from S to the ordinals, taking each element of S to its rank.
This composite cannot be unbounded in V(i), by assumption, so its image has
a supremum m inside of V(i), and so f is a subset of V(m) and so is small. 

        We use locally small categories in V(i): any subset of V(i) may be
objects, but for any objects A and B there is a small set of morphisms
hom(A,B) from A to B. An AB5 category is an Abelian category with all small
colimits, such that suprema of small filtered sets of subobjects (of a given
object B) are preserved by intersection (with any subobject of B). It
follows that every small filtered set of subobjects is a stably effective
epimorphic family over its supremum.

	When we speak of a well-powered category we assume each object A has a
selected small set Sub(A) of one representative of each equivalence class of
monics to A. By a "subobject" of A we mean one of these selected
representatives.

The following lemmas and theorems hold for any well-powered AB5 category
with generator U.

Lemma 1: Given any objects C and D, there is a small set isomorphic to the
set of all partial morphisms from C to D, that is all morphisms f:V-->D from
subobjects V>->C.
PROOF: There is a small set of subobjects Sub(C+D). A subset of C+D whose
projection onto C is monic, is the graph of a partial morphism, and vice versa. 

LEMMA 2: An object M is injective iff it looks injective to U. That is, iff
every morphism h:V-->M from a subobject V>->U extends to some g:U-->M.
PROOF: Given any subobject B>->A and morphism f:B-->M consider the obvious
partially ordered set E of pairs <B',f'> where B' is a subobject of A
containing B, and f' extends f. By Lemma 1 this is isomorphic to a small
poset, and so every linearly ordered subset of it is small. So AB5 and
Zorn's lemma show it has maximal elements.  The assumption on M implies that
any maximal element of E must have B'=A.

LEMMA 3: Each object A has a monic A>->M1 such that every morphism f:V-->A
from a subobject V>->U extends to a morphism from U to M1. 
PROOF: Consider the set I of all morphisms f:V-->A from any subobject V of
U, to A. For each such f:V-->A we will paste a copy of U onto A by
identifying V with its image under f. The result of all that pasting is M1.
It is the cokernel of the natural morphism from (the coproduct of all
domains of morphisms in I) to  A+(the I-fold copower of U). By Lemma 1, the
set I is isomorphic to a small set so that the coproducts do exist. 

THEOREM: Every object a has a monic A>->M where M is injective. 
PROOF: We iterate the construction from Lemma 2 transfinitely, for each Mj
give a monic Mi>- >M(j+1), continuing to the first cardinal larger than
Sub(U). Let the colimit be M. By AB5, each Mj has a monic Mj>->M. Now take
any subobject V>->U and any f:V-->M. If we knew that f factored as V-->Mj
for some ordinal j we would be done, since by construction f would extend to
a morphism U-->M(j+1). So consider the subobjects Vj>->V gotten by pulling
back Mj>->M along f. This is an increasing chain of subjects,  and Sub(U)
cannot be cofinal in this chain, so the chain is eventually constant. Say it
is constant from Vs onwards. By AB5 the supremum of this chain is V, and so
V=Vs and f factors through Ms. That proves the theorem. Notice we could have
just iterated the construction to the first cardinal larger than any chain
of subobjects of U well ordered by inclusion.

I am reviewing a paper whose main result sounds like it ought to be known.
Is it and can anyone give me a citation?

Let E be a cocomplete category with a small dense subcategory C (so every
e of E is the colimit of C/e --> E).  Then an object \Omega of E is a
subobject classifier in E iff it represents the subobject functor
restricted to C.

Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca
Precedence: bulk
Status: RO
X-Status: 

The cartesian closed category Pos of posets comes with functors built
using x and ->.  Are there any spurious dinatural transformations between
these functors, in the sense that they cannot be represented in a suitable
simply-typed lambda-calculus?

While the general question is for n-ary functors, the case of unary
functors like Ax(A->A) -> AxAxA should constitute the nub of the problem.

Bob Pare mentioned to me at CT97 in Vancouver that A->A in Pos was "clean"
in this sense, having only the expected dinaturals from A->A to A->A,
namely the Church numerals.  This is in contrast to Set, where Pare and
Roman in a JPAA paper last year (pp. 33-92) gave a litany of spurious
dinaturals for this functor, and also to Chu(Set,2), which likewise
has spurious dinaturals from A-oA to A-oA, albeit of a quite different
character from those of Set.

The only closed monoidal category I'm aware of that contains no spurious
dinaturals in this sense is Girard's *-autonomous category Coh of
coherence spaces, for which Audrey Tan obtained full completeness
for multiplicative linear logic in her 1997 Ph.D. thesis.  That is,
the only dinaturals between functors built using tensor product and -o
are those corresponding to cut-free MLL proofs, the MLL criterion for
"no spurious dinaturals."

What other monoidal closed categories arise in nature that have no
spurious dinaturals?  Are any of them cartesian closed?  In particular
is Pos such?  And how about PER?

                       Category Theory OctoberFest

                       McGill University, Montreal
                 Saturday - Sunday, October 16 - 17, 1999

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We invite you to join us in Montreal next October for a weekend meeting
in Category Theory, the "not-quite-annual" OctoberFest. As has been the
tradition with these meetings, we invite talks from all participants. If
you wish to give a talk, send your request along with a short abstract
(before the end of September please) to Robert Seely at the address
below. Early in October the program committee will announce a
preliminary schedule on the Categories email list, and on the CTRC/CRTC
web site. The final schedule will be announced at the meeting.

We will meet in the Bronfman Building, 1001 Sherbrooke West, on Saturday
morning, October 16th. Coffee will be available from 8:30 am. The first
talk will be at 9:00. Registration will take place during the morning,
before the first talk and during the first coffee break.

There will be a registration fee of about $CAN45 (approximately $US30),
with luck, less: all possible attempts will be made to keep this as low
as we can. The precise amount will be announced in early October,
along with the proposed schedule.  There will be a dinner/party to be
held Saturday evening, hosted by Marta Bunge.  (Instructions for getting
to the Bunge home will be announced at the meeting.)  Please let us know
if you intend to join us by sending a short email (before the end of
September if possible) to Robert Seely, also indicating whether or not
you will bring a guest to the party. (We need to have a good estimate of
how many people will attend the party about a week before the meeting.)

Below you will find a list of hotels and tourist rooms close to McGill.
Please note that October is a popular month for visiting Montreal, and
early booking is recommended. If you have any further questions, please
contact one of us.

The preprint `Representable multicategories' is available at


http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au:8000/u/hermida

 

     Abstract: We introduce the notion of representable multicategory,
which stands in the same relation to that of monoidal category as
fibration does to contravariant pseudofunctor (into Cat). We give an
abstract reformulation of multicategories as monads in a suitable Kleisli
bicategory of spans. We describe representability in elementary terms via
universal arrows.  We also give a doctrinal characterisation of
representability based on a fundamental monadic adjunction between the
2-category of multicategories and that of strict monoidal categories. The
first main result is the coherence theorem for representable
multicategories, asserting their equivalence to strict ones, which we
establish via a new technique based on the above doctrinal
characterisation. The other main result is a 2-equivalence between the
2-category of representable multicategories and that of monoidal
categories and strong monoidal functors. This correspondence extends
smoothly to one between bicategories and a localised version of
representable multicategories.

CTCS '99 is the 8th conference on "Category Theory and Computer
Science."  The purpose of the conference series is the advancement of
the foundations of computing using the tools of category theory. While
the emphasis is upon applications of category theory, it is recognized
that the area is highly interdisciplinary.

Previous meetings have been held in Guildford (Surrey), Edinburgh,
Manchester, Paris, Amsterdam, Cambridge, and S. Margherita Ligure
(Genova).

 A Categorical Guide to Separation, Compactness and Perfectness 
 
 Walter Tholen 
 
 Based on a rather arbitrary class of morphisms in a category, which play the role of "closed 
maps", we present a general approach to separation and compactness, both at the object and the 
morphism levels. It covers essential parts of the classical topological theory, generalizes 
various previous categorical treatments of the theme, and allows for a number of less expected 
applications outside topology.

                     2nd Announcement of 
             
                    5th DOMAINS WORKSHOP 

             (Darmstadt, 23. - 26. September 1999)


Dear colleagues,

the 5th Workshop on Domains will take place in Darmstadt from Thursday, the
23rd of September till Sunday, the 26th of September. 

We will start on Thursday after lunch. In this session there will be talks by 
D.Scott and A.Jung on the occasion of Klaus Keimel's 60th Birthday. Afterwards,
there will be a football match in the early evening followed by a barbecue. 

Whether there will be program on Sunday or it will be the day of departure 
will depend on the number of talks that people want to deliver. The idea of 
having in principle two full days for talks is motivated mainly by the 
intention to avoid a too dense schedule and leave enough time for discussion.

The talks should concentrate on the following topics
      
    - Classical Domain Theory 
    - Denotational Semantics of Programming Languages
    - Categorical Logic and Realisability
    - Synthetic Domain Theory
    - Non-Classical Domain Theory (Stable Domains, Full Abstraction ...)
    - Exact Computation on Classical Spaces 

This list is not exclusive and talks on related topics are encouraged.
As usual there will be "open house" in the sense that there is no refereeing 
and people are invited to talk about work in progress. 

For registration, please, send a message to

        marz@mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de
       
together with title and abstract of your talk. If you want to give a talk
you have to tell us till 23rd August 1999.

More information about the workshop can be found at the homepage

      http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~erker/wd5/

In particular, there you can find an address via which you can reserve
accommodation. We also plan to organise some private accommodation for
undergraduate students who cannot afford to pay the hotel expenses.

Awaiting your registration

                                     Michael Marz, Thomas Streicher

  2nd International Workshop on Probabilistic Methods in Verification

                  http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/probmiv99/ 

                       a satellite to CONCUR'99
 
                       Eindhoven, 23rd Aug 1999 
           (to coincide with EXPRESS'99, another satellite)

SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP 
  
  Probability inherently features in software and hardware systems,
  either as a means to derive efficient solutions (e.g. randomization),
  or as a result of unreliable or unpredictable behaviour (e.g.
  fault-tolerant systems, computer networks, etc).  *Probabilistic
  verification* encompasses a range of theoretical, algorithmic and
  programming methods that assist in establishing the correctness of
  probabilistic systems against specifications.  Typically this involves
  calculating the probability bounds for a temporal logic formula being
  satisfied, based on an appropriate probability space on computations,
  but also includes properties such as cost analysis and long-run
  average.  Additionally, probabilistic verification can provide
  guarantees the specifications hold with satisfactory probability in
  cases when conventional model checking is not feasible.


  The idea of this workshop is to bring together researchers that apply
  probabilistic methods across the whole spectrum of verification. The
  meeting aims to enable cross-fertilisation of ideas and techniques
  between areas that are usually not in regular contact through
  conferences, from semantics, probability theory, performance analysis
  and computational linear algebra, through randomized algorithms,
  probabilistic  logics, model checking, abstract interpretation, to
  practical experimental work, tools and applications.

  This is the second workshop of this kind.  The first meeting,
  PROBMIV'98 was held in 1998 as a satellite to LICS.  In 1999, the
  workshop takes place as a satellite to CONCUR.
