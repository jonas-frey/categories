I only met Max a couple of times, but I vividly remember a particular
phrase of his. He would ask, "What's the deal?", and that was a prelude
to cutting right through to the mathematical essence of an argument. The
phrase has stayed with me ever since.

I heard Max once say, without bluster or false modesty,  that he was
just a competent mathematician. Setting the bar that high, he was an
inspiration even to those (like me) who had little hope to clear it.

So many persons have said so many nice things about Max, as a
mathematician, with which of course I fully agree, that it would be
vain for me to try to add anything on that subject. As a person, his
kindness, his sense of humor will be missed by all of us, and as
Eduardo said "category land" will be much different and a lot more dull.

Preliminary Announcement and First Call for Papers
ALGEBRAIC AND TOPOLOGICAL METHODS IN NON-CLASSICAL LOGICS III
(TANCL'07)
5-9 August, 2007
St Anne's College (University of Oxford)
Oxford, England

This international  conference is the third in the series Algebraic  and
Topological methods in Non-Classical Logics (TANCL). The first  was held
in 2003 in Tbilisi, Georgia:

http://sierra.nmsu.edu/morandi/TbilisiConference/Home.html

and the second in 2005 in Barcelona, Spain:

http://www.mat.ub.es/~logica/meeting2005/

AIMS AND SCOPE

The topics covered by TANCL'07 lie within a well-established and
active area of mathematical logic.   It is hoped to attract to the
meeting established researchers and also postdoctoral and graduate
students, from the UK and overseas.

The objectives are

(1) to provide a showcase for recent advances in the field;

(2) to facilitate the exchange of ideas and expertise
between  mathematicians, logicians, and theoretical computer
scientists working on many facets of
non-classical logic;

(3) to foster future collaborations.

The programme will focus on three interconnecting  mathematical
themes central to the  study of non-classical logics and their
applications: algebraic, categorical, and topological methods. Three  more
specialized satellite workshops are planned (see below).

We are pleased to announce two special events that will be held in =20
2007, in Italy and France respectively, in honour of Jean-Yves =20
Girard, who celebrates his 60th birthday this year:

*************************

Workshop on
Linear Logic, Ludics, Implicit Complexity and Operator Algebras.
Dedicated to Jean-Yves  Girard on his 60th birthday.

University of Siena (Italy) at the Certosa di Pontignano, May 17-20, =20
2007.

Organizing committee:  Michele Abrusci (Roma III), Claudia Faggian =20
(CNRS - Paris 7), Simone Martini (Bologna), Simona Ronchi Della Rocca =20=

(Torino), Aldo Ursini (Siena, chair)

www.unisi.it/eventi/LOGIC

*************************

and


*************************

Journ=E9es Jean-Yves Girard
Conference in honour of his 60th birthday

Institut Henri Poincar=E9, Paris, September 10 and 11, 2007

Organizing committee: Michele Abrusci (Roma III) Pierre-Louis Curien =20
(CNRS - Paris 7, chair), Martin Hyland (Cambridge), Giuseppe Longo =20
(ENS, Paris), Mitsu Okada (Keio U., Tokyo), Phil Scott (Univ. of =20
Ottawa), Jacqueline Vauzeilles (Paris 13, co-chair)

http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/jyg60

*************************

Both events will be an occasion to celebrate Jean-Yves Girard's deep =20
achievements in Mathematics and in Computer Science, and the =20
pervasive influence of his ideas in those disciplines and beyond.

The Siena workshop also celebrates the 20th anniversary of the =20
completion of his
fundamental paper on Linear Logic. The aim is to gather people =20
working in the
many research streams originating from Girard's main achievements of =20
the recent years. For each of the four main themes---Linear Logic =20
(specifically, Proof Nets and Geometry of Interaction), Ludics, =20
Implicit Complexity and Operator Algebras---there will be in-depth =20
lectures (3 to 4 hours), with emphasis on the state of the art and =20
prospects for future development. There will also be some time for 30-=20=

minute contributed papers and for discussion of general perspectives =20
and philosophical foundations.

This workshop has been organized to complement the celebration in =20
Paris, which will take place immediately after Jean-Yves' birthday. =20
Through our choice of invited speakers, we hope  to illustrate  the =20
wide range of scientific interests of Jean-Yves Girard over thirty-=20
five years, from  the complexity of proofs to quantum mechanics, from =20=

system F to the geometry of computation, from denotational semantics =20
to Von Neumann algebras.

The two web sites will provide all details.

Max visited Saunders Mac Lane in Chicago in 1970-71, and conversations
with him then were both great fun and greatly influenced my work. To quote
from the preface to ``The geometry of iterated loop spaces'', in which I
introduced operads, ``The notion of `operad' defined in Section 1 arose
simultaneously in Max Kelly's categorical work on coherence, and
conversations with him led to the present definition''.  It is a pity
that, due to ill-advised suggestions by a referee a little later, his
January, 1972, preprint ``On the operads of J.P. May'' was not published
until 2006! It contains many often rediscovered insights. See
http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/13/tr13abs.html.

We also had many conversations about his upcoming role as chair in Sydney.
In those days, before e-mail and even xerox, the problem of relative
isolation down under was much on Max's mind, and he thought that this was
one good reason for following his heart and working to make Sydney a home
for the development of the then underappreciated area of category theory
that he so much loved.  We are all in his debt for the marvelous way that
he succeeded.

Dear colleagues,

I'd like to draw your attention to an opening for a tenure (track)
position at Utrecht, at the level of "universitair docent" (comparable
to Lecturer in the UK, Assistant Professor in the US or Maitre de
Conferences in France). The position is related to a large group grant
in the area between (and including) geometry/topology and mathematical
physics, which I'm sure will fit the interests of many readers of this
list.

For more information, see http://www.math.uu.nl/Positions/

With best regards,

Ieke Moerdijk.

This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 245)
John Baez

The University of Toronto is an urban campus, rather grey and chilly
at this time of year.  Nestled amid other buildings at the southern
edge of campus, the Fields Institute doesn't stand out.

But inside, you'll find a spacious and peaceful atrium, with a
fireplace to keep you cozy.  A spiral staircase winds up three or
four stories.  Hanging from the ceiling far above is a 3d model of
the "120-cell": a beautiful 4-dimensional solid with 120 regular
dodecahedra as faces.

This is a tribute to the great geometer H. S. M. Coxeter, master of
polyhedra, who worked for 60 years at the University of Toronto after
studying philosophy at Cambridge under Wittgenstein.  You'll also
find Coxeter's piano sitting at the base of the spiral staircase.
It's out of tune, but resting on it there's a wonderful strange
portrait of him playing the very same piano - at the age of three.
He looks a bit like the child Mozart.  And indeed, at the age of 12
Coxeter composed an opera!

The Fields Institute specializes in having conferences, and it's
a great place for that.  A friendly and efficient staff, public
workstations, wireless internet everywhere, a nice little cafe in
the back, and the centerpiece: a large lecture room with 3 double
blackboards.  Unfortunately the middle blackboard doesn't stay up -
it's needed that repair for years, old-timers say.  But apart from
that, everything is as close to mathematician's heaven as could be
expected.

Eugenia Cheng, Peter May and I ran a workshop at the Fields
Institute from January 9th to 13th:

1) Higher Categories and Their Applications,
http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/fields/

You can see photos of people and abstracts of their talks
at this site.  You can also see PDF files of many of their
talks - and even listen to talks!

The first day, Tuesday, was all about 2-categories and 3-categories -
"lower category theory", you might say.   While some are
eagerly sailing into the stratosphere of n-categories for
general n, or even n = infinity, there's still a lot to
understand for n = 2 and 3.

For starters, Tom Leinster spoke about strict 2-categories versus
weak ones (also known as bicategories).  It's a famous fact - a
generalization of Mac Lane's coherence theorem - that every weak
2-category C is equivalent to a strict one st(C).  However, this is
true *if* your notion of equivalence is suitably weak!  In short,
what we've got is an inclusion of weak 3-categories:

i: Strict2Cat -> Weak2Cat

where

Strict2Cat = [strict 2-categories,
              strict 2-functors,
              strict natural transformations,
              modifications]

and

Weak2Cat = [weak 2-categories,
            weak 2-functors,
            weak natural transformations,
            modifications]

Every object in Weak2Cat is equivalent to one in the image of
this inclusion.  But, the inclusion is not itself an equivalence!

Steve Lack spoke about Gray-categories, also known as "semistrict"
3-categories - a convenient middle ground between the strict
3-categories and the weak ones (also known as tricategories).

The idea here goes back to John Gray.  In the usual Cartesian
product of categories, whenever we have a morphism

f: A -> B

in the first category and a morphism

f': A' -> B'

in the second, we get a commuting square:

           (f,1)
   (A,A') -------> (B,A')
     |               |
(1,g)|               |(1,g)
     |               |
     v               v
   (A,B') -------> (B,B')
           (f,1)

in their Cartesian product.  The same is true for the Cartesian
product of 2-categories.   But in the "Gray" tensor product of
2-categories, these squares commute only up to 2-isomorphism.
And, we can use this weakening of the Cartesian product to weaken
the concept of strict 3-category, and obtain the concept of
"semistrict" 3-category, or "Gray-category".

Here's how.  A strict 3-category is a gizmo with:

a) a bunch of objects,

b) for any pair of objects x,y, a 2-category hom(x,y),

and

c) for any triple of objects x,y,z, a 2-functor

o: hom(x,y) x hom(y,z) -> hom(x,z)

such that

d) associativity and the unit laws hold.

A semistrict 3-category is a gizmo with:

a) a bunch of objects,

b) for any pair of objects x,y, a 2-category hom(x,y),

and

c) for any triple of objects x,y,z, a 2-functor

o: hom(x,y) tensor hom(y,z) -> hom(x,z)

where "tensor" is the Gray tensor product, such that

d) associativity and the unit laws hold.

The slight difference is very important.  Not every weak 3-category
is equivalent to a strict one.  But, they're all equivalent to
semistrict ones!

There are, alas, some deficiencies in the semistrict world, which
Steve Lack has recently noted:

2) Steve Lack, Bicat is not triequivalent to Gray, available as
math.CT/0612299.

To understand this, you may need a little warmup.  Given strict
2-categories B and C there's a strict 2-category hom(B,C) such that
strict 2-functors

A x B -> C

are in natural 1-1 correspondence with strict 2-functors

A -> hom(B,C)

Here's what hom(B,C) is like:

hom(B,C) has strict 2-functors from B to C as objects,
             strict natural transformations between these as morphisms,
             modifications between these as 2-morphisms.

We can pose the same question with the Gray tensor product replacing
the Cartesian product.  Given 2-categories B and C there's a
2-category [B,C] such that strict 2-functors

A tensor B -> C

are in natural 1-1 correspondence with strict 2-functors

A -> [B,C]

Here's what [B,C] is like:

[B,C] has strict 2-functors from B to C as objects,
          weak natural transformations between these as morphisms,
          modifications between these as 2-morphisms.

This suggests that we consider a 3-category intermediate between
Strict2Cat and Weak2Cat.   It's called Gray, and it goes like this:

Gray = [strict 2-categories,
        strict 2-functors,
        weak natural transformations,
        modifications]

We have inclusions of weak 3-categories:

Strict2Cat -> Gray -> Weak2Cat

and Lack shows, not only that the second inclusion fails to be an
equivalence, but that there's *no* equivalence between Gray and
Weak2Cat.

All this suggests that for some purposes we really need to face up
to weak 2-categories: the strict and semistrict setups aren't flexible
enough for every job.  The same is undoubtedly true at the 3-category
level - and that's where the next talk comes in!

In the next talk, Nick Gurski spoke about weak 3-categories.  He wrote
his thesis about these, and I'm starting to really wish he'd put his
thesis on the arXiv, so everyone can see how cool it is and learn more
about 3-categories.  But, I guess he wants to perfect it.

In his talk, Nick not only explained the definition of weak 3-category,
which is famously complicated - he did his best to convince us that
we could reinvent this definition ourselves if we tried!  Then he
went ahead and discussed various proofs that every weak 3-category is
equivalent to a semistrict one.

An interesting theme of all three talks was the idea of treating
the "strictification" functor implicit in Mac Lane's coherence
theorem:

st: Weak2Cat -> Strict2Cat

as the left adjoint of the inclusion

i: Strict2Cat -> Weak2Cat

where now we think of both Strict2Cat and Weak2Cat as mere
1-categories.  You can read more about this idea here:

3) Miles Gould, Coherence for categorified operadic theories,
available as math.CT/0607423.

On Tuesday night, Mike Shulman gave an introduction to model
categories, which are a tool developed by Quillen in the late
1960s to unify homotopy theory and homological algebra.
If you want to understand the basics of model categories, you
should probably start by listening to his talk, and then read
this:

4) W. G. Dwyer and J. Spalinski, Homotopy theories and model
categories, available at
http://hopf.math.purdue.edu/Dwyer-Spalinski/theories.pdf

For more references, try "week170".

Here's the rough idea:

In homotopy theory we study topological spaces; in homological
algebra we study chain complexes.  But, in both cases we study
them in a funny way.  There's a category of topological spaces
and continuous maps, and there's a category of chain complexes
and chain maps, but these categories are not everything that
counts.  Normally, we say two objects in a category are "the
same" if they're isomorphic.  But in this case we often use a
weaker concept of equivalence!

In homotopy theory, we say a map between spaces

f: X -> Y

is a "weak homotopy equivalence" if it induces isomorphisms on
homotopy groups:

pi_n(f): pi_n(X) -> pi_n(Y)

In homological algebra, we say a map between chain complexes

f: X -> Y

is a "quasi-isomorphism" if it induces isomorphisms on homology
groups:

H_n(f): H_n(X) -> H_n(Y)

Model category theory formalizes this by speaking of a category
C equipped with a classes of morphisms called "weak equivalences".
We can formally invert these and get a new category Ho(C) where
the weak equivalences are isomorphisms: this is called the
"homotopy category" or "derived category" of our model category.
But this loses information, so it's often good *not* to do this.

In a model category, we also have a class of morphisms called
"fibrations", which you should imagine as being like fiber bundles.
Dually, we have a class of morphisms called "cofibrations", which you
should imagine as well-behaved inclusions, like the inclusion of
the closed unit interval in the real line - not the inclusion of
the rationals into the real line.

Finally, the weak equivalences, fibrations and cofibrations
satisfy some axioms that make them interlock in a powerful way.
These axioms are a bit mind-numbing at first glance, so I won't
list them.  But, they encapsulate a lot of wisdom about homotopy
theory and homological algebra!

On Wednesday the talks were about n-categories and homotopy
theory.  I kicked them off with a general introduction to the
"Homotopy Hypothesis": Grothendieck's idea that homotopy theory
was secretly about infinity-groupoids - that is, infinity-categories
where all the j-morphisms have weak inverses.

5) John Baez, The homotopy hypothesis,
http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/homotopy/

Part of the idea is that if you hand me a space X, I can cook up
an infinity-groupoid which has:

 points of X as objects,
 paths in X as morphisms,
 homotopies between paths in X as 2-morphisms,
 homotopies between homotopies between paths in X as 3-morphisms,
 etc....

This is called the "fundamental infinity-groupoid of X".

But another part of the idea is that if you hand me a model
category C, I can cook up an infinity-category which has:

 nice objects of C as objects,
 morphisms in C as morphisms,
 homotopies between morphisms in C as 2-morphisms,
 homotopies between homotopies between morphisms in C as 3-morphisms,
 etc....

The basic idea here is simple: we're studying homotopies between
homotopies between... and so on.

(But, there's a little technicality - this "nice object" business.
An object of C is "fibrant" if its unique morphism from the initial
object is a fibration, and "cofibrant" if its unique morphism to
terminal object is a cofibration.  Objects with both properties
are what I'm calling "nice".  For example, in the category of
topological spaces, the "cell complexes" (made by gluing balls
together) are nice.  In the category of chain complexes, the
"projective" chain complexes are nice.  Only for these nice
objects do homotopies work as well as you'd hope.  Luckily,
every object in C is weakly equivalent to one of these nice ones.)

The interesting thing about the above infinity-category is that it's
an "(infinity,1)-category", meaning that all its j-morphisms are
weakly invertible for j > 1.  For example, maps between spaces
aren't necessarily invertible, even up to homotopy - but homotopies
are always invertible.

We can define "(infinity,k)-categories" for any k in the same way,
and we see that (infinity,0)-categories are just infinity-groupoids.
So, the Homotopy Hypothesis reveals the beginning of what might be
a very nice pattern.  Roughly:

 Topological spaces, as studied in homotopy theory, are secretly
 (infinity,0)-categories.

 Model categories, as studied in homotopy theory, are secretly
 (infinity,1)-categories.

 ????, as studied in homotopy theory (not yet?), are secretly
 (infinity,2)-categories.

  Etcetera....

Presumably the ???? should be filled in with something like
"model 2-categories", with the primordial example being the
2-category of model categories, just as the primordial example
of a model category is the category of spaces.

But, there's only been a little study of this sort of "meta-homotopy
theory" so far.  For example:

6) Julie Bergner, Three models for the homotopy theory of homotopy
theories, available as math.AT/0504334.

After my talk, Simona Paoli spoke about her work on turning the
homotopy hypothesis from a dream into a reality:

7) Simona Paoli, Semistrict models of connected 3-types and
Tamsamani's weak 3-groupoids, available as math.AT/0607330.

8) Simona Paoli, Semistrict Tamsamani n-groupoids and connected
n-types, available as math.AT/0701655.

Eugenia Cheng then spent the afternoon leading us through another
approach:

9) Clemens Berger, A cellular nerve for higher categories,
available at http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/383423.html

10) Denis-Charles Cisinski, Batanin higher groupoids and homotopy
types, available as math.AT/0604442.

I would love to explain this stuff, mainly as an excuse for
learning it better!  But alas, I'm getting a bit tired and we're
only on the second day of the workshop... I must hurry on.

On Wednesday evening, Peter May spoke about some applications of
weak 2-categories that appear in his new book:

11) Peter May and J. Sigurdsson, Parametrized Homotopy Theory,
American Mathematical Society, 2006.

The rough idea is that we have a weak 2-category with:

 spaces as objects,
 spectra over X x Y as morphisms from X to Y,
 maps between spectra over X x Y as 2-morphisms.

Lots of ideas from "parametrized" stable homotopy theory are
neatly encoded as results about this 2-category.

Thursday was all about (infinity,1)-categories.  The first talk
was by Mike Shulman, who gave a nice intuitive treatment of Andre
Joyal's approach to (infinity,1)-categories.

In 1957, Daniel Kan figured out a nice way to describe
infinity-groupoids as simplicial sets with a certain property:
now they're called "Kan complexes".  They're very popular among
homotopy theorists.  You can read about them here:

12) Paul G. Goerss and J. F. Jardine, Simplicial Homotopy Theory,
Birkhaeuser, Basel, 1999.

Given this, it's not so surprising that we can describe
(infinity,1)-categories as simplicial sets with some more
general property.  In fact this was done by Boardmann and Vogt
back in 1973.  In the last decade or so, Joyal has developed
an enormous body of results about these (infinity,1)-categories,
which he calls "quasicategories".  He is writing a book on the
subject, which is not quite done yet - but it's already enormously
influenced the state of higher category theory, and I expect it
will continue to do so.

Next Julie Bergner compared different approaches to (infinity,1)-
categories.  I mentioned a while back that she's one of the few
people who has worked hard on "meta-homotopy theory".  That was
very much in evidence in her talk.

She began by describing a bunch of different definitions of
(infinity,1)-category.  But then she showed these definitions
weren't really so different!  For each definition, she constructed
a model category of all (infinity,1)-categories of that type.
And then, she sketched the proof that all these model categories
were "Quillen equivalent".

For details, listen to her talk or try this paper:

13) Julie Bergner, A survey of (infinity, 1)-categories,
available as math.AT/0610239.

In the afternoon, Andre Joyal spoke about quasicategories.
I urge you to listen to his talk and also the minicourse he
later gave on this subject:

14) Andre Joyal, Graduate course on basic aspects of
quasicategories, http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/audio/#crs-quasibasic

I can't possibly summarize this stuff!  It basically amounts to
taking the whole of category theory and extending it to
quasicategories.

(Well, I guess I just summarized it, but....)

After Joyal's talk, Joshua Nichols-Barrer spoke about using
quasicategories as an approach to understanding "stacks", which
are like sheaves, only categorified.

In the evening, Kathryn Hess spoke about some work she's doing
with Steve Lack, on parallel transport in bundles of bicategories.
Sounds like physics, but they came to the subject from a completely
different motivation!

Finally, Dorette Pronk spoke about weak 2-categories and weak
3-categories of fractions.  The notion of a "calculus of fractions"
goes back at least to the work of Gabriel and Zisman in 1967:

15) P. Gabriel and M. Zisman, Categories of Fractions and Homotopy
Theory, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1967.

Say you have a category and you want to throw in formal inverses to
some morphisms.  Well, you can do it!  But in general, the morphisms
in the resulting category will be arbitrarily long "zig-zag" diagrams
in your original category, like this:

X_1 ---> X_2 <--- X_3 ---> X_4 <--- X_5 ---> X_6

The arrows pointing backwards are the ones you threw in formal
inverses for.

This is a nuisance!  But luckily, in nice cases, you only need to use
zig-zags of length two.  This is what a "calculus of fractions"
achieves.  A classic example is when you start with a model category
C, and you throw in formal inverses for the weak equivalences to
get the "homotopy category" Ho(C).

Dorette Pronk has been looking at how all this generalizes when
you have a weak 2-category or weak 3-category and you throw in
*weak* inverses to some morphisms.  This has some interesting
applications to stacks:

16) Dorette A. Pronk, Etendues and stacks as bicategories of
fractions, Compositio Mathematica, 102 (1996), 243-303.  Also
available at http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/recherche?h=nc&id=CM_1996__102_3_243_0

Dorette's talk ended at 9 pm, and everyone went home and collapsed
after a hard day's work.  Actually not: a bunch of us went out and
partied!  One of the great things about working on n-categories is the
sense of camaraderie among the small crowd that does this.

Friday's talks were about higher gauge theory.  Since I've discussed
this many times here, I'll be terse.  Alissa Crans explained Lie
2-groups and Lie 2-algebras, and then Danny Stevenson explained his
work on connections, 2-connections and Schreier theory (see
"week223").  In the afternoon, Urs Schreiber described his ideas
on higher-dimensional parallel transport and local trivializations,
with a little help from Toby Bartels.

Friday evening, we heard talks from Simon Willerton (on Hopf monads)
and Igor Bakovic (on 2-bundles).  Quite an evening!  Bakovic is an
impressive young Croatian fellow who seems to have taught himself
n-categories.  We were all horrified when it became clear he had over
30 pages of transparencies, but his talk was actually quite nice.

And if you like higher-dimensional diagrams anywhere near as much
as I do, you've got to take a look at Willerton's slides:

17) Simon Willerton, The diagrammatics of Hopf monads,
http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/fields/willerton/

Again the talks ended at 9 pm.

Finally, on Saturday morning, spoke about Frobenius algebras and
their relation to Khovanov homology:

18) Aaron Lauda, Frobenius algebras, quantum topology and higher
categories, available at
http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lauda/talks/Fields/

Urs Schreiber then wrapped things up with a talk about the
quantization of strings from a higher category viewpoint.
You can get a good feeling for this from his blog entries at
the n-Category Cafe, which are all listed on my webpage for
this workshop - the first webpage mentioned this Week.

1. PROJECT SUMMARY: ASPECT REFACTORING TOOLS
Software systems are rarely written from scratch: they evolve over
long periods of time. When a change is made, this often affects many
different locations in a system, and it is hard to make a change
consistently. For that reason, automated tools to help the process
of software change are desirable. "Refactoring" refers to the process
of restructuring an existing piece of software, often prior to
introducing new functionality, or to take advantage of a new
technology. Refactoring must preserve the behaviour of existing code,
and tools that help in refactoring both assist in the restructuring
process and in checking that the behaviour has not changed.

Unfortunately today's refactoring tools are very hard to construct,
they are still quite limited in functionality, and they often contain
bugs. This project aims to construct a framework for better
refactoring tools. In particular, the work is driven by refactorings
for a new set of language features, called `aspect-oriented programming'
that have recently been added to Java.

Our framework will be based on developments in three separate areas
of computer science:
* `strategies' to control the process of rewriting program code,
  from the `term rewriting' community
* `reference attributed grammars' to specify the conditions that
  guarantee behaviour is preserved, from the `compilers' community
* `incremental evaluation' of declarative rules, from the
  `functional and logic programming' community.

The quality of our framework will be assessed by coding selected
case studies using alternative methods. In particular, we shall
implement several refactorings directly in Eclipse, the leading
development environment for writing aspect-oriented programs in industry.

The project is funded by the EPSRC (UK equivalent of NSF).


2. REQUIREMENTS

The PhD student will be concerned with the theoretical foundations of
the refactoring framework, for instance proofs of correctness for
refactorings, and also for the incremental evaluation mechanism.
We are thus looking for someone with good mathematical skills, in
particular regarding formal properties of type systems and program
analyses. Candidates must have an outstanding undergraduate or
master's degree in computer science. Funding is provided to pay
for university fees at EU level (overseas candidates need supplementary
funding), plus subsistence, travel, equipment etc.

The 2-months positions are intended to assist with implementation work.
We are thus looking for highly skilled Java programmers; familiarity
with program analysis, formal type systems and so on will be an
advantage. These internships are in fact short-term appointments
as research assistants at the University of Oxford, and so the holders
will be paid a salary. Interns can be outstanding undergraduate
students who wish to gain research experience.

3. HOW TO APPLY

The deadline for applications is March 20, 2007.

* For the PhD studentship, follow the instructions on

   http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/prospective/dphil/

  Clearly mark your application "Aspect Refactoring Tools
  project".  Also send a full electronic copy of your application
  to oege@comlab.ox.ac.uk, by March 20, 2007.

* For the 2-months positions, send a letter explaining your
  interest in the project, plus a full cv and the names of
  3 referees to oege@comlab.ox.ac.uk.

4. FURTHER INFORMATION

         Structural Operational Semantics 2007

         An Affiliated Workshop of LICS 2007  and  ICALP 2007

         July 9, 2007, Wroclaw, Poland

         http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~rvg/SOS2007

Aim: Structural operational semantics (SOS) provides a framework
for giving operational semantics to programming and specification
languages. A growing number of programming languages from
commercial and academic spheres have been given usable semantic
descriptions by means of structural operational semantics. Because
of its intuitive appeal and flexibility, structural operational
semantics has found considerable application in the study of the
semantics of concurrent processes. Moreover, it is becoming a
viable alternative to denotational semantics in the static analysis
of programs, and in proving compiler correctness.

Recently, structural operational semantics has been successfully
applied as a formal tool to establish results that hold for classes
of process description languages. This has allowed for the
generalisation of well-known results in the field of process
algebra, and for the development of a meta-theory for process
calculi based on the realization that many of the results in this
field only depend upon general semantic properties of language
constructs.

This workshop aims at being a forum for researchers, students and
practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for
future investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics.
One of the specific goals of the workshop is to establish synergies
between the concurrency and programming language communities working
on the theory and practice of SOS. Moreover, it aims at widening the
knowledge of SOS among postgraduate students and young researchers
worldwide.

Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

  * programming languages
  * process algebras
  * higher-order formalisms
  * rule formats for operational specifications
  * meaning of operational specifications
  * comparisons between denotational, axiomatic and SOS
  * compositionality of modal logics with respect to
    operational specifications
  * congruence with respect to behavioural equivalences
  * conservative extensions
  * derivation of proof rules from operational specifications
  * software tools that automate, or are based on, SOS.

Papers reporting on applications of SOS to software engineering and
other areas of computer science are welcome.

History: The first SOS Workshop took place on the 30th of August 2004
in London as one of the satellite workshops of CONCUR 2004.
Subsequently, SOS 2005 occurred on the 10th of July 2005 in
Lisbon as a satellite workshop of ICALP 2005, and SOS 2006 on the
26th of August 2006 in Bonn as a satellite workshop of CONCUR 2006.
A special issue of the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming on
Structural Operational Semantics appeared in 2004; a special issue of
Theoretical Computer Science dedicated to SOS 2005 is in press, and a
special issue of Information & Computation on Structural Operational
Semantics inspired by SOS 2006 is in preparation.


INVITED SPEAKER:

   Pawel Sobocinski (Cambridge, UK)

   Programming, Constraint Logic Programming, Inductive Logic
   Programming, Alternative Inference Engines and Mechanisms.

- Applications: Deductive Databases, Data Integration, Software
   Engineering, Natural Language, Web Tools, Internet Agents,
   Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics.

The three broad categories  for submissions are: (1) technical papers,
where  specific  attention  will  be  given to  work  providing  novel
integrations of the areas  listed above, (2) application papers, where
the  emphasis will be  on their  impact on  the application  domain as
opposed  to  the advancement  of  the  the  state-of-the-art of  logic
programming,  and (3)  posters,  ideal for  presenting and  discussing
current work not  yet ready for publication, for  PhD thesis summaries
and research project overviews.

In addition to papers and  posters, the technical program will include
invited talks, tutorials, a Doctoral Consortium, and workshops.


Papers and Posters

Papers  and  posters must  describe  original, previously  unpublished
research,  and must  not simultaneously  be submitted  for publication

Workshops

The ICLP'07 program will  include several workshops.  They are perhaps
the best place for the  presentation of preliminary work, novel ideas,
and new  open problems to  a wide and interested  audience.  Workshops
also   provide  a   venue  for   presenting  specialized   topics  and
opportunities for  intensive discussions and  project collaboration in
any areas  related to logic  programming, including cross-disciplinary
areas.    You    can    find     the    call    for    proposals    in
http://www.dimi.uniud.it/dovier/WICLP07/.

Workshop proposal submission deadline: February 14, 2007.


Doctoral Consortium

The  Doctoral  Consortium  (DC)  on  Logic Programming  is  the  third
doctoral  consortium  to  be   offered  as  part  of  ICLP  conference
series. The  DC builds  on the experience  of the  previous successful
consortiums (held in Sitges, Spain  and in Seattle, WA) during ICLP-05
and ICLP-06. The DC is designed for doctoral students working in areas
related  to logic  and  constraint programming,  who  are planning  to
pursue a career  in academia. The DC also  considers applications from
Master's   students  pursuing  projects   in  logic   programming  and
interested in  entering a  doctoral program.  The  Doctoral Consortium
aims to  provide students with  an opportunity to present  and discuss
their research directions  and to obtain feedbacks from  peers as well
as world-renown  experts in the  field.  The Doctoral  Consortium will
also offer  invited speakers and panels  discussions. More information
can be found at http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~epontell/DC2007/.


Conference Venue

ICLP  2007 will  be  held in  the  city of  Porto,  second largest  in
Portugal.  Porto is located by the Douro river and the Atlantic, has a
truly unique appearance with  many striking bridges, a historic center
classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage site, a new House of Music by
Rem Koolhaas  and a  nice Museum of  Modern Art (Museu  de Serralves).
Porto is  also well known for  the much celebrated Port  wine grown in
the Douro valley.   The conference will feature a  cruise in the Douro
river along with other optional tours.

The Conference will take place in the Hotel "Le Meridien Park Atlantic
Porto".

Dear all,

    Consider the following straightforward coequaliser (e,E) formed by
f,g:A-->B and e:B-->E, with e.f=e.g. I am working in a category with
biproducts, and with a contravariant involutive endofunctor (--)^\dag
on the category which is compatible with the biproducts; i.e.
                (projection)^\dag = injection
for all projections and injections making up a part of a biproduct. In
such a category, it is natural to consider the coequaliser object E to
be the subspace of B on which the morphisms f and g agree. It is
therefore natural to require e.(e^\dag) = id_E; this sort of condition
is similar to the sorts of conditions that form part of the definition
of the biproduct.

    I'm asking whether there exists a natural framework generalising
the theory of biproducts, which is analagous to the way that
(co)limits generalise (co)products, within which I can safely assume
that e.(e^\dag) = id_E. Biproducts seem quite different from products
and coproducts, though, so I don't know how it would work.

               Jamie Vicary.

Dear Jamie,

your equation e.(e^\dag) = id_E only makes sense if your functor
(--)^\dag is the identity on objects. In this case, you are dealing
with a dagger category in the sense of [1]. Dagger categories are
important in quantum physics; an important example is the category
Hilb of Hilbert spaces and linear operators, with dagger being the
adjoint of an operator.

I will dualize your question to make it a question about equalizers,
or more generally, monomorphisms. Monomorphisms with the property
(e^\dag).e = id_E are investigated in [2], where they are called
dagger-subobjects. (Both papers also deal with biproducts of the kind
you asked about).

Your question raises a basic problem, which is that it is not
well-defined. Specifically, while equalizers are only defined "up to
isomorphism", the property

 (e^\dag).e = id_E   (*)

is not invariant under isomorphisms of E. As a simple example, the two
morphisms f,g: C -> C^2 in Hilb, defined by f(x) = (x,0) and g(x) =
(2x,0), define isomorphic subobjects, yet f satisfies (*), whereas g
does not. Therefore one cannot ask whether "the" equalizer of two maps
satisfies (*).

The fundamental issue is that in a dagger-category, there is a
distinguished subclass of isomorphisms: the unitary ones. An
isomorphism f: E -> E' is called unitary if f^\dag = f^{-1}. And
although the property (*) is not invariant under arbitrary
isomorphisms, it is invariant under unitary isomorphisms.

To many category theorists, it may seem strange that some important
categorical property is not invariant under isomorphism. But actually,
this is quite natural. With every notion of structure comes a notion
of structure-preserving isomorphism, and one expects properties
related to the structure to be preserved only by the
structure-preserving isomorphisms, not by arbitrary isomorphisms.
Dagger is such a structure, whose structure-preserving morphisms are
exactly the unitary ones.

Now to get back to your question: Consider equalizers (or more
generally, subobjects) in a dagger category. Of the many maps e: E ->
A representing a given subobject (or equalizing a given pair of
arrows), some may not be unitarily isomorphic to some others, so they
fall into equivalence classes modulo unitary isomophism. One may ask
whether any of these equivalence classes is distinguished, i.e.,
whether one of them deserves to be called "the" equalizer or "the"
subobject, and would be unique up to unitary isomorphism. It turns out
that, provided it exists at all, there is indeed a distinguished
choice of such a subobject, and it is the one satisfying (*). So we
can call a monomorphism satisfying (*) a "dagger-subobject", and an
equalizer satisfying (*) a "dagger-equalizer", and so forth. (In the
literature, particularly on Hilbert spaces, a morphism satisfying (*)
is also called an "isometry").

Fortunately, if any representative of a subobject satisfies (*), then
that representative is unique up to unitary isomorphism. So it really
makes sense to speak of "the" dagger-subobject etc.

While uniqueness is easy, existence is a tricky matter. There
certainly are examples of subobjects that are not isomorphic to any
dagger-subobject. One such example is in the category of integer
matrices (objects are arities, composition is matrix multiplication,
and dagger is transpose). The morphism (2) (as a 1x1-matrix) is monic,
but not isomorphic (as a subobject) to any isometries. However, it is
also not an equalizer. To get an example with equalizers, consider the
two morphisms f = (1,0) and g = (0,1) (as 1x2-matrices). Their
equalizer is the 2x1-matrix e = (1,1)^\dag. However, this is not
isomorphic to any isometry, and hence not to any dagger-equalizer.  So
in general, dagger-equalizers don't exist even if equalizers do.  (For
this example, it is important that the scalars are integers. If real
numbers were allowed, then e/sqrt{2} would be the dagger-equalizer.)

On the other hand, it is proved in [2] (Proposition 5.6) that under
some relatively mild condition, every subobject is isomorphic to a
dagger-subobject.

I hope this answers part of your question!

Let me close with some speculation: if e : E -> A is a monomorphism
such that (e^\dag).e is invertible, then it is probably relatively
easy to add a representative e' : E' -> A freely, and fully
faithfully, to the category such that e,e' are isomorphic (as
subobjects) and e' satisfies (*). [Clearly if (e^\dag).e is not
invertible, then this is never possible]. On the other hand, it is not
clear whether (e^\dag).e is invertible in general, or whether at least
this is the case when e is an equalizer.

Peter,

    Thank you for that detailed response! So it seems that if these
dagger-subobjects do exist, then then will have good properties. But
existence is tricky; in particular, there does not seem to be an
elegant property (analagous to having finite limits and colimits) that
will guarantee that all of this works.

    Could we make the following definition: a dagger-category has
'finite bilimits' if any finite diagram D in the category has an
'isometric cone', a cone for which all the associated morphisms to the
objects of D are isometries, along with some sort of condition that
the isometries are orthogonal in the correct way. It is interesting to
consider this in the case of products and equalisers: for products
AxB, so it seems, the isometries to A and B will generally be
_projectors_, but for equalisers E-e->A=f,g=>B, the isometry e will
generally be an _injector_! So we cannot ask for the cone morphisms to
be isometric projectors, or isometric injectors. But perhaps this is
OK, and we can just require them to be isometries. This definition of
bilimit has the 'local flavour' of the definition of biproducts, but
cooking up a generally-applicable orthogonality condition on the
isometries seems tricky.

    Of course, in the light of
              http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0604542   ,
perhaps we only need require that our dagger-category has products and
equalizers in order for it to have 'finite bilimits'! In remark 2.6 of
[2] cited in your email below, you write that if a dagger-category has
products then it must of course have coproducts, but it need not have
biproducts. Presumably, math.CT/0604542 proves you wrong here?

                     Jamie.

http://www.3wftop.math.unipd.it/

What is formal topology

When topology is developed in a strictly constructive way,
for instance over Martin-Loef's type theory, points cannot be
given primitively and the pointfree approach is fundamental.
This is the reason why it is called formal. Formal topology
has now become an important tool in constructive mathematics.

Tutorials

Before the workshop, two days of extensive and coordinated
tutorials are planned, given by Bernhard Banaschewski and
other pioneers: http://www.3wftop.math.unipd.it/tutorials.html

You are referring to the paper "Finite Products are Biproducts in a
Compact Closed Category" by Robin Houston.

It does not prove me wrong. Robin's construction only applies to
compact closed categories. In general, a dagger category doesn't need
to be compact closed.

Actually, there is a counterexample to support my remark 2.6. It is
due to Robin Houston and myself (any typos or mistakes are mine).

(1) There exists a category C with finite products and coproducts,
    with a zero object, and such that for all A,B, A+B is isomorphic
    to AxB (not naturally), but for some A,B, the canonical map f:A+B
    -> AxB is not an isomorphism.

    Proof: Let C be the category of sets of cardinality 0 or aleph_0,
    with partial functions as the morphisms. Then the empty set is
    initial and terminal. We have AxB = A \union (A*B) \union B, where
    "x" denotes categorical product, and "*" denotes cartesian product
    of sets. Further A+B = A \union B. By inspecting cardinalities, we
    find that AxB and A+B have equal cardinality, for all A, B, and
    hence they are (not naturally) isomorphic. However, the canonical
    map f:A+B -> AxB satisfying p_i.f.q_j = \delta_{ij} maps
    everything to the first and third components of AxB = A \union
    (A*B) \union B, hence is not onto when A,B are non-empty.

(2) Corollary: C does not have biproducts.

(3) Corollary: There exists a category C with finite products and
    coproducts, and such that A+B = AxB for all A,B, but which does
    not have biproducts.

    Proof: choose a skeleton of the category in (1).

(4) There exists a dagger category with finite products, but which
    does not have biproducts.

    Proof: Take C as in (3), and consider D = C x C^op. Then D has
    products and coproducts as inherited componentwise from C and
    C^op. Also, it satisfies X+Y = XxY. Further, D has no biproducts,
    or else the forgetful functor to C would preserve them.

    Now consider D', the full subcategory of D consisting of objects
    of the form (A,A). This has products and coproducts, and they are
    not biproducts. Further, D' is a dagger category with (f,g)^{\dag}
    = (g,f).

Another related remark is that even *if* a dagger category has
biproducts, then they need not be dagger-biproducts. Here is a
counterexample. Consider the category of matrices with rational
entries. Objects are arities, and composition is standard matrix
multiplication, but define the following non-standard dagger: if A is
an mxn-matrix, then let A^\dag = A^{transpose} * 3^(n-m). This is
indeed an involutive, identity-on-objects functor.  As a category, it
is equivalent to finite-dimensional Q-vector spaces, so it has
biproducts, and it is also compact closed. However, there are no
isometries e : Q -> Q^2 (and hence, no dagger-biproducts). If such an
isometry existed, say with matrix (a, b)^{transpose}, then we would
have e^\dag.e = (a^2 + b^2)/3 = 1. However, the equation a^2 + b^2 = 3
has no solution in the rational numbers. (In Z/9Z, any sum of two
squares that is divisible by 3 is also divisible by 9; therefore the
same holds in the integers. The claim about the rational numbers
follows by taking a sufficiently large square common denominator).

I do not know whether Robin Houston's construction, when applied to a
dagger compact closed category, yields dagger-biproducts.  Note that
the previous counterexample is not dagger-compact closed (dagger does
not preserve tensor). It therefore doesn't answer this last question.

Best, -- Peter

Fred Linton has pointed out to me that my terminology here is not
standard. By "isometric injector", I mean a morphism which is unitary
on its range, i.e., one-to-one and norm-preserving in the case of
Hilbert spaces; I believe this is usually simply referred to as an
isometry. By "isometric projector", I mean a morphism which is unitary
on the complement of its kernel; some people prefer to call this a
"partial isometry". I was then using the terms "isometric" and
"isometry" to mean "isometric projector or isometric injector".

    Anyway, the simple prescription I give for a bilimit cannot work,
as it is easy to find diagrams in the category of finite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces, our canonical example of a strongly compact-closed
category with biproducts, for which the colimit and limit are not
isomorphic. A diagram f:A-->B for non-iso A and B is the simplest
example. However, if we restrict to diagrams F:D-->FdHilb such that D
admits a dagger-operation compatible with the dagger on FdHilb, then I
believe the conjecture becomes plausible.

            Regards,
                 Jamie Vicary.

Algebraically-inclined readers may be interested in the following new
journal, which embodies all the virtues discussed in the recent thread
on publishing as well as boasting an impeccably eminent editorial board.

Subject: [Eager-gen] New Journal: Algebra and Number Theory
Date: Sat, 17 Feb 2007 17:54:02 -0800

Dear number theorists, algebraists, and algebraic geometers,

We are thrilled to announce the launch of a new journal:

                     Algebra & Number Theory
                         http://jant.org

The purpose of the journal is to provide an alternative to the
current range of commercial specialty journals in these fields -
an alternative of higher quality and much lower cost.

The policies of Algebra & Number Theory are set by the editorial
board, a group of working mathematicians, rather than by a
profit-oriented company, so they will remain friendly to
mathematicians' interests. In particular, they will promote broad
dissemination, easy electronic access, and permissive use of content
to the greatest extent compatible with survival of the journal.
The journal is published by Mathematical Sciences Publishers,
using the efficient model that has proved successful for its
other journals, such as Geometry & Topology.

Please encourage your library to subscribe!
And submit your high-quality original articles to us!

For more information, see http://jant.org

Best,
--

The answer is no (unless I have overlooked something below, which is all
too easy to do when cooking up pathological counterexamples).

We're looking for a category that:
 - has a dagger compact-closed structure,
 - has biproducts
 - does *not* have dagger-biproducts.

I've tried to keep the description quite concrete, perhaps too
much so for the taste of some readers of this list.

1. Let A be the category with:
   - the set of objects is the set of integers;

   - an arrow is a rational number:
     A(n,n) = Q, and
     A(m,n) = {0}, for m != n;

   - composition is multiplication;

   - the following compact closed structure:
     [ The symbol @ denotes tensor below]

     m @ n := m + n  for objects m, n
     q @ r := q x r  for arrows q, r,
     The tensor unit is the object 0,
     n* := -n;

   - the obvious preadditive structure: addition within a
     hom set is just addition of rational numbers;

   - the trivial dagger: q^\dagger := q for each arrow q.

   Note that A is a (preadditive) dagger compact closed category.

2. Let B be the category of matrices over A, i.e. the result of
   freely adding finite biproducts to A. Concretely, an
   object of B is a finite tuple of integers (n_i | i<k) for
   some natural number k. An arrow

     f: (m_i | i<k)  -->  (n_j | j<k')

   is a k x k' matrix of rational numbers, with the property that
   the (i, j)th entry is 0 unless m_i = n_j.

   Composition is matrix multiplication. The biproduct of two
   objects is their concatenation as tuples. The dagger compact
   closed structure distributes over the formal biproducts,
   in the standard way.

3. Let C be the full subcategory of B determined by those
   objects (n_i | i<k) with the property that:

     for all i<k there exists j<k s.t. n_j = -n_i.

   Note that C is closed under tensor, * and biproduct.

Of course there is a 'standard dagger' (transposition), and
a standard compact closed structure that's compatible with it.
I'll define a new dagger on C, and exhibit a compact closed
structure that's compatible with this new dagger. The purpose
of the restriction in (3) is to make it possible -- or at any
rate easier -- to define this compact closed structure. Finally
I'll show that C does not have dagger-biproducts, with respect
to this new dagger.

Given a matrix

   f: (m_i | i<k)  -->  (n_j | j<k')

let f^\dagger be the transpose of f, multiplied by the scalar

   2 ^ (max {n_j | j<k'} - max {m_i | i<k})

If either k or k' is zero, this expression is ill-defined, but
the matrix is also empty so that doesn't matter.

Below I shall write max(n_i) as an abbreviation for max {n_i | j<k};
the intended k will be clear from the context.

This dagger is clearly involutive. Also

    max( (m_i | i<k) @ (n_j | j<k') ) = max {m_i + n_j | i<k, j<k'}
                                      = max(m_i) + max(n_j),

from which it follows that this dagger is compatible with tensor.
It's thus easy to check that C is dagger symmetric monoidal w.r.t
this dagger.

For the compact closed structure, consider an object A and denote
the standard unit eta_A: (0) --> A* @ A. Define eta'_A to be the
product of eta_A with the scalar 2 ^ -max(A). By the restriction
of (3), we know that max (A* @ A) = 2 max(A), hence

  (eta'_A)^\dagger  =  (2 ^ max(A)) x epsilon_A

where epsilon_A is the standard counit. Thus the additional
scalar factor in (eta'_A)^\dagger is the reciprocal of that
in eta'_A, so they cancel out as required.


Finally, to see that C does not have dagger biproducts, consider
the objects (0) and (-1,1). The injection i: (0) --> (0,-1,1) is
a matrix [ q ] for some rational q. Then i^\dagger = [ 2q 0 0 ],
         [ 0 ]
         [ 0 ]
so i^\dagger . i : (0) -> (0) is the 1x1 matrix [ 2q^2 ]. For this
to be the identity, we would need to have 2q^2 = 1, but that
equation famously has no solution in the rationals!


Can anyone see any errors in the above, or think of a simpler example?

Robin

Dear Peter,

what you are calling a "dagger-category", i.e.

     a category equipped with a contravariant involutive
     endofunctor, which is the identity on objects,

has been called "a category with involution", at least from Burgin
1969 to Lambek 2001. "Involutive category" has also been used, if
less. (The main object of these papers, or most of them, is:
categories of relations.)

I think it would be better to come back to the old term, which is
meaningful, translatable, and old.

With best regards

Marco

My family and I sincerely thank all the members of the Category Theory
community who, when Max died, sent messages of condolence to us through
Ross. It has been a great comfort to us that so many mathematicians have
commented on the contribution Max made to your area of mathematics. Many of
you, too, made mention of the help and friendship he freely offered.

Warm regards to you all,
Imogen

Dear all,

This is to announce the availability of two preprints.

1)
"Group valued differential forms revisited"

We study the relationship between combinatorial group valued
differential forms and classical differential forms with values in
the corresponding Lie algebra. In particular, we compare simplicial
coboundary and exterior derivative. The results represent
strengthening of results I obtained in 1982.

This preprint can be downloaded from
http://www.imf.au.dk/publs?id=636

or from my home page

http://home.imf.au.dk/kock/

2)
"Some matrices with nilpotent entries, and their determinants"

We study algebraic properties of matrices whose rows are mutual
neighbours, and are also neigbours of 0 (neighbour in the sense of a
certain nilpotency condition). The intended application is in synthetic
differential geometry. For a square matrix of this kind, the product of
the diagonal entries equals the determinant, modulo a factor n!

This preprint can be downloaded from
http://arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0612435

or from my home page (address as above).


Yours
Anders

There's also a body of work, mainly from mathematical physics, that
calls these categories "star-categories".

But, by now there's enough literature using the term "dagger-categories"
that the genie is out of the bottle.

Dear John,

Sooner or later somebody will call them "sharp" categories, or
"tilde" categories...  What you are saying is a good argument in
favour of a sensible, well established name.

Also, on a more general ground, should we have a different
terminology in, say:

- category theory,
- category theory applied to computer science,
- category theory applied to physics?

Funny names, like quark, can be good and typographical names can be
useful, when there is no better substitute. Eg, I do not know of any
good substitute for "comma category". But I see no reason to replace
a sensible name with a meaningless one; or, even worse, many
meaningless ones.

---------

Dear Jeff,

The problem you are mentioning is essentially based on terminology
for different dualities in higher categories. I do not think there is
a way of finding a coherent terminology for them, which would not
clash with some well established, quite sensible use, already
existing in some particular case.
Therefore, I would not be surprised if the contravariancy of an
involution should assume different meanings in different contexts.

---------

All the best

Marco
