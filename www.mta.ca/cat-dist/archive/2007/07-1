Mike Barr has put his finger on the key points: papers are needed not =
just as a contribution to the advancement of knowledge but also for =
career prospects and the awarding of research grants, which are also =
related to career prospects. Further there are the notions of `impact =
factor' of various journals, and that of citation indices.=20

On the last,  some Governments  take the line that a journal to be rated =
for research promotion has to be on the list of the Institute for =
Scientific Information (ISI: http://scientific.thomson.com/). It is =
possible that the UK Government, in moving to using `metrics' for =
research impact, will take this line.  A search of the ISI list shows =
that it has of course journals of major publishers and of national =
academic institutions, and that it claims to  have a procedure for =
adding journals to their list. But the operation of the listing is based =
on the idea that not all journals need to be listed, in order to assess =
significance. TAC is not on the list, and I think neither is NYJM, =
Cahier. It is also difficult to get on the list, as evidence from =
editors shows, and there is no evidence of an academic input to the ISI  =
procedures. The organisation is a commercial organisation, which has =
some control of scientific information.=20

Eugene Garfield writes in 2004:=20
Garfield, Eugene] ARE YOU SUGGESTING ISI COVER THE LOWEST IMPACT =
JOURNALS AND PASS LESS ATTENTION TO THE HIGHEST?=20
[Garfield, Eugene]  WE CANNOT CONTROL HOW THE DATA IS USED. I HAVE DONE =
MY BEST TO PREVENT ITS ABUSE BUT I HAVE NO POWER TO CONTROL IT.=20

Perhaps also mathematicians in research assessment forget the long time =
scale of the impact of new ideas. It is very easy to rate work which is =
related to famous problems. It is less easy to rate work which opens a =
new range of ideas, as has category theory, for example. I am grateful =
to David Corfield for pointing out a quotation from Rota's `Indiscrete =
thoughts' p.48:=20

 ``What can you prove with exterior algebra that you cannot prove
without  it?" Whenever you hear this question raised about some new
piece of  mathematics, be assured that you are likely to be in the
presence of something important. In my time, I have heard it
repeated for random  variables, Laurent Schwartz' theory of
distributions, ideles and Grothendieck's schemes, to mention only a
few. A proper retort might be: ``You are right. There is nothing in
yesterday's mathematics that could not also be proved without it.
Exterior algebra is not meant to prove old facts, it is meant to
disclose a new world. Disclosing new worlds is as worthwhile a
mathematical enterprise as proving old conjectures.

There is a discussion of ISI and related issues of impact factors etc in =

Another, and quite successful, example is the Journal of High Energy  
Physics (http://jhep.sissa.it), an on-line journal which I have  
worked for at its beginnings, many years ago (back in 1997).
Papers can be submitted by indicating an arXiv number, or by  
uploading a (PDF, LaTeX...) file.
The editorial procedure is fully automatized, in the sense that it is  
fully operated on the web site, with minimal human intervention. This  
allows to reduce maintenance costs, and to speed up the publishing  
process of one magnitude (the average time from submission to  
publishing is something less than 2 months, which is mostly due to  
the referees). Once, accepted papers were freely available online  
from JHEP site; nowadays, these are available online through IOP's  
Electronic Journals service; but I guess that papers are still  
available for free (at least for some time), or at a reasonable price.

Ten years ago, JHEP was started by an academic consortium as a  
spontaneous answer to the (already!) outrageously increasing prices  
of the main journals in the HEP field, especially Nuclear Physics B  
(which is run by Elsevier, and costs more than 15200 euros/year... so  
Vico was right, after all.) Nowadays, JHEP has become one of the  
major journals in the field: for instance, Ed Witten, Ashoke Sen and  
Cumrun Vafa regularly publish papers on JHEP.
For what it is worth, in 2005 the JHEP Impact Factor was 5.944, that  
of Nuclear Physics B was 5.522.  So on-line journals can compete with  
"standard" journals also on this point.

As far as the "real existence" of online papers, especially for grant  
applications, career advancements, etc: if I remember correctly, from  
a formal point of view the only important thing is that to have an  
ISSN number - which means that the journal is officially recognized  
as a periodical publication. The existence of a "printed version" to  
store and forget in dusty (and increasingly deserted) libraries is  
not needed.

Dear categorists,

I have no idea where to ask the following algebra question. Hoping that 
some of you are algebraists, I am asking it here.

I am looking for examples of small (finite and with few elements, say up 
to 8) commutative semirings with unit, by which I mean an algebraic 
structure which has +, *, 0 and 1, both operations are commutative and * 
distributes over +. The initial such structure are the natural numbers.

Here are the examples I know:

1) Modular arithmetic, i.e., (Z_n, +, *, 0, 1)

2) Distributive lattices with 0 and 1.

3) "Cut-off" semiring, in which we compute like with natural numbers, 
but if a value exceeds a given constant N, then we cut it off at N. For 
example, if N = 7 then we would have 3 + 3 = 6, 3 + 6 = 7, 4 * 4 = 7, 
etc. Do such semirings have a name?

There must be a census of small commutative rings, or even semirings. 
Does anyone know?

Andrej

This site lists a lot of algebraic structures and often gives  
information on finite examples:

     http://math.chapman.edu/cgi-bin/structures

-----
Thus, for commutative rings (with 1) you have:

http://math.chapman.edu/structuresold/files/ 
Commutative_rings_with_identity.pdf

where you can find that there are:

- 1 structure with 1 element (or 2, 3, 5, 6 elements)
- 4 structures with 4 elements.

-----
The case of semirings is not (yet?) much developed: just a few  
results and trivial examples.
See:

http://math.chapman.edu/structuresold/files/ 
Semirings_with_identity_and_zero.pdf
http://math.chapman.edu/structuresold/files/Semirings_with_zero.pdf

-------
Commutative semirings are not in the list, I think.

Example (1) of section 3.2 of "Temporal Structures", MSCS 1:2 179-213 
(1991), also at http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/man.pdf, enumerates the 
commutative semirings both of whose operations are idempotent (thus 
defining two partial orders), with the additive order furthermore being 
linear.  We showed there are 2^{n-2} of these having n elements, and 
indicated where the first three (those with n = 2 or 3) have previously 
appeared in the literature.

Interestingly the linearity of the additive order implies that of the 
multiplicative order.  Once this has been shown it is an easy step to 
the following pleasant representation.

Start with an n-element chain, n>1, viewed as a string of n beads with 0 
at the bottom.  Select any nonzero element as the (multiplicative) unit, 
and then determine the multiplication by allowing the portions of the 
string on either side of the unit to dangle down, with the beads 
interleaving arbitrarily subject to 0 remaining below the rest.  One can 
then readily show that there are 2^{n-2} choices for the unit and 
multiplication.

For each n exactly one of these is a Heyting algebra (example 2 of 
Andrej's list), namely the one for which the additive top was selected 
as the unit.  (So for n = 2 or 3 only the one non-Heyting semiring will 
be at all unfamiliar.)  I would be interested to hear of appearances in 
the literature of any of the three non-Heyting such with four elements.

As a class exercise around 1989 I assigned the enumeration problem for 
various weakenings of these conditions, which I can't locate right now 
though Ken Ross, kar at cs columbia edu, might conceivably have kept a 
record.

I don't have a specific reference in 2-category language but the following 
should be relevant:

The notion of a homotopy theory for groupoids was set up in my 1968 topology 
book now revised and republished as Topology and Groupoids. In particular
\pi_1: spaces \to groupoids preserves homotopies. Fibrations were introduced 
in an exercise, and developed in later editions. See also Philip Higgins' 
Categories and Groupoids, (1971) now available as a TAC reprint. The nerve 
and classifying space of a groupoid are in Graeme Segal's `Classifying 
spaces and spectral sequences' (IHES) utilising Grothendieck's nerve of a 
category. These preserve homotopy. The fact that for a CW-complex X, [X,BG] 
\cong [\pi_1 X, G] is also well known: P.Olum Ann Math 1958?

There is also relevant material in Gabriel-Zisman's book, but I do not have 
it with me.

People should also look at 2 papers on groupoids by P A Smith in the Annals, 
1951.

Hope that helps.

Hi Andrej,

Here are some odds and ends:

You can build a semiring from any semiring R with no nonzero additive 
inverses by attaching an element at infinity (\infty+x = \infty for all x 
and and \infty * x = \infty for nonzero x).  Iterating this, you can have 
a hierarchy of elements at infinity, I suppose.  For example, take your 
cutoff semiring and add an element at infinity; this gives some new 
specimens.

More generally, you can use finitely generated semirings (over a given 
finite semiring, for example).  The above construction would be the 
quotient of R[x] where every polynomial of degree greater than 0 is 
identified with x.

For another example, any finite linearly ordered commutative monoid is 
naturally a semiring, where the addition is max and the multiplication is 
given by the monoid law.  For example, "cutoff monoids" of N.  This 
example is somehow lifted from tropical geometry, which is (speculatively) 
relative algebraic geometry over the semiring R\cup {-\infty}, where 
R here denotes the reals, the addition law is max and the multiplication 
is addition in R.

Maybe a easier question is what are the "minimal" finite semirings, for 
some appropriate notion of minimal.  I'm thinking something analogous to 
the notion of field for rings, although even to classify the finite fields 
takes a bit of clever work...

Here is a different approach to the question (after a conversation with K. 
Kedlaya):

Given a semiring R, you can "mod out by elements with additive inverses" 
by identifying a and b whenever there are x and y with a+x=b and b+y=a.  
This produces a new semiring R' where no element other than 0 has an 
additive inverse; the operation kills all rings and fixes distributive 
lattices and cutoff semirings.  The resulting semiring has a natural 
ordering, namely a <= b iff there is an x with a+x = b (so that 0 is the 
least element).  I don't know what to call these, maybe ordered semirings?

As a next step, you can take an ordered semiring R as above and identify 1 
with 2 to produce something even simpler.  We still have a partial 
ordering, of course, and moreover addition is join: if b <= a and c <= a, 
then b+c <= a+a = a.  This does nothing to distributive lattices or the 
ordered commutative monoids above, but it turns cutoff semirings into the 
semiring with elements {0,1} and 1+1=1.  You might call these "tropical 
semirings."

Finally, you might want to transform the multiplication in a tropical 
semiring R into meet.  I guess this would be done by identifying 
everything greater than or equal to 1 with 1, and then identifying x^2 
with x for each x.

Summarizing, I guess, the forgetful functors

BddDistLat --> TropSemiRing --> OrdSemiring --> Semiring

all seem to have left adjoints.  Maybe another way to look into semirings 
would be to study the fibres of the left adjoints?  The adjunction between 
bounded distributive lattices and tropical semirings already looks 
interesting...

Another thing that would be cool to see would be a duality theory for 
tropical semirings, maybe like the duality theory for bounded distributive 
lattices, as a way to get a handle on tropical semirings at least...  Of 
course, what I'd really like to see is a geometric picture of Spec R for 
any semiring R, but that might take a little more work...

Best,
Josh

               *** CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS ***

                            ICLP'07

          23rd International Conference on Logic Programming

                       September 8-13, 2007
                         Porto, Portugal

              URL: http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/iclp07/


ICLP'07, the 23rd International Conference on Logic Programming, will
be held in Porto (Portugal), from September 8 to 13, 2007.

Workshops co-located with international conferences are perhaps
the best place for the presentation of preliminary work or
novel ideas, new open problems to a wide and interested audience.
Co-located workshops also provide a venue for
presenting specialized topics and opportunities for intensive
discussions and project collaboration. The topics of the workshops
co-located with ICLP'07 can cover any areas related to logic  
programming,
(e.g., Theory, Implementation, Environments, Language Issues,
Alternative Paradigms, Applications) including cross-disciplinary areas.
However, any workshop proposal will be analyzed.

The format of the workshop will be decided by the workshop organizer(s),
but ample time must be allowed for general discussion.
Workshops can vary in length, but the optimal duration
will be half a day or a full day.

Workshop Proposal:
==================

Those intending to organize a workshop at ICLP'07 are invited
to submit a workshop proposal. Proposals should be in English and
about two pages in length. They should contain:

   * The title of the workshop.
   * A brief technical description of the topics covered by the  
workshop.
   * A discussion of the timeliness and relevance of the workshop.
   * A list of some related workshops held in the last years
   * The (preliminary) required number of half-days allotted to the  
workshop
     and an estimate of the number of expected attendees.
   * The names, affiliation and contact details (email, web page, phone,
     fax) of the workshop organizer(s) together with a
     designated contact person.
   * The previous experiences of the workshop organizing committee in
     workshop/conference organization.

Proposals are expected in ASCII or PDF format. All proposals should be
submitted to the Workshop Chair by email by February 14, 2007.

Reviewing Process:
==================

Each submitted proposal is reviewed by the Workshops Chair and the
Conference Program Chairs. Proposals that appear well-organized and
that fit the goals and scope of ICLP will be selected.  The decision
will be notified by email to the responsible organizer by February  
28, 2007.

The definitive length of the workshop will be planned according to the
number of submissions received by the different workshops. For every
accepted workshop, the ICLP local organizers will prepare a meeting
place and can print the workshop proceedings, whose LaTeX preparation
is however in charge to the workshop organizers. The workshop
registration fees will be handled together with the conference fees.


Workshop Organizers' Tasks:
===========================


   * Producing a "Call for Papers" for the workshop and posting it
     on the net and/or other means. Please provide a web page URL which
     can be linked into the ICLP'07 home page by April 15, 2007.
   * Providing a brief description of the workshop for the conference
     program.
   * Reviewing/accepting submitted papers.
   * Scheduling workshop activities in collaboration with the local
     organizers and the workshop chair.
   * Sending workshop program and workshop proceedings in  pdf
     format to the workshop chair for printing (deadline to be defined)
   * The use of the Computing Research Repository (CoRR) for the
     workshop proceedings is strongly suggested (see http:// 
logicprogramming.org/
     [Guidelines for electronic publishing of proceedings])


Location:
=========


All workshops will take place in the city of Porto at the site of the
main conference. See the ICLP'07 web site for location details.


Important Dates:
================


February  14,   2007: Proposal submission deadline
February  28,   2007: Acceptance notification
April     15,   2007: Deadline for receipt of CFP and URL for

Subject: categories: A question about literature on operads and coherence

I am writing up material that has been taking shape over a number of 
years.  The question is of the type "how much of this has been done 
before?"  

The shape of the math is that questions of coherence of categories with 
multiplication can be given a group theory flavor and so groups are 
injected in the middle of the discussion.  I expect that little 
recognition will take place after the introduction of the groups, so my 
question focuses on what happens before the groups show up.

I circulated this question a bit with the aid of a pdf file, but this 
list won't take attachments, so I will have to make do with some latex.

The latex follows the signature.

Any communication should be by direct email.  I am far from a category 
theorist and do not follow this list.

Thanks for any information,
Matt Brin

If \(\scr{C}\) is a category with (functoral) mutliplication
\(\otimes\), then inside the operad \(End_\scr{C}\) there is a
suboperad \(\bigotimes\) derived from the multiplication \(\otimes\)
and an obvious surjective map of operads \(h:\scr{T}\rightarrow
\bigotimes\) whose domain is the operad of finite binary trees.
This map will take, for example, the tree \(\rdoublet\) to the
functor \begin{equation} \label
{ExFunctA}(X,Y,Z)\mapsto X\otimes(Y\otimes Z)\end{equation} in
\(End_{\scr{C}}\) and the tree \(\ldoublet\) to the functor
\begin{equation} \label {ExFunctB} (X,Y,Z)\mapsto
(X\otimes Y)\otimes Z \end{equation} in \(End_{\scr{C}}\).

If there is a natural isomorphism \(\alpha\) given from the functor
(\ref{ExFunctA}) to the functor (\ref{ExFunctB}) in \(End_{\scr{C}}\),
then the isomorphisms generated in the usual way from (composites of
expansions of instances of) \(\alpha\) and \(\alpha^{-1}\) and the
identity isomorphisms on the functors in \(\bigotimes\) gives a
category structure to \(\bigotimes\).

There are now two category structures that we can put on the operad
\(\scr{T}\) of finite binary trees.  One is a ``pullback'' category
structure that we get from the category structure on \(\bigotimes\)
where we use \(h:\scr{T}\rightarrow \bigotimes\) to do the
pullback.  (Morphisms from \(T_1\) to \(T_2\) are just the morphisms
from \(h(T_1)\) to \(h(T_2)\).)  The other category structure on
\(\scr{T}\) is the trivial structure in which every pair of trees
with the same number of leaves gets a uniqe (iso)morphism between
them in each direction.  We let \(\bigotimes^h\) denote the pullback
category and reuse the notation \(\scr{T}\) for the trivial category
structure.

There is a forgetful functor from \(\bigotimes^h\) to \(\scr{T}\)
that is the identity on objects.  The point of the coherence question is 
to
ask whether this forgetful functor is an isomorphism.

At this point we probably leave the realm that might seem familiar.
However, I will press on in case
the ``probably'' is wrong, and to tell what the point of all
this is.

Particularly pleasant properties of the operad \(\scr{T}\) allow one
to compute two groups: one \(T(\bigotimes^h)\) from \(\bigotimes^h\)
and another \(F\) from \(\scr{T}\).  The second group is well known
and is usually referred to as ``Thompson's group \(F\)'' so we have
kept the letter \(F\) for it.

There is a surjective homomorphism (call it a comparison
homomorphism) \(\sigma\) from \(T(\bigotimes^h)\) to \(F\).  The
surjectivity is standard and the arguments are in
MacLane paper noted below.

Under the assumption that the multiplication \(\otimes\) has an
identity (an object \(K\) in \(\scr{C}\) with a natural isomorphism
\(\iota\) from the identity on \(\scr{C}\) to the functor \(X\mapsto
X\otimes K\) with no further restrictions such as the satisfaction
of a coherence property on the isomorphism \(\iota\)), then one
proves easily that the associativity morphism \(\alpha\) makes the
pentagonal diagrams commute if and only if the comparison
homomorphism \(\sigma\) is an isomorphism.  In fact, once a certain
``non-collapsing'' fact is proven from the existence of the identity
\(K\), the rest is just a quote of definitions.

Thus \(\scr{C}\) is a monoidal category if and only if the
``identity isomorphism'' \(\iota\) satisfies the usual coherence
conditions on identities and the comparison homomorphism \(\sigma\)
is an isomorphism.

One can do exactly the same thing with symmetric, monoidal
categories (in which case the comparison homomorphism is to a well
known group known as Thompson's group \(V\)) and braided tensor
categories (in which case the comparison homomorphism is to a group
\(BV\) of mine that I call the braided version of \(V\)).  In the
case of symmetric, monoidal catetgories, the argument again boils
down to a check of definitions once certain basic facts are
established.  In the case of braided tensor categories, there are
real calculations that must be done since the definition of braided
tensor categories reads very differently than it does for monoidal
and symmetric, monoidal categories.

This ends the summary.

I can clarify my question a bit.  I am familiar with the paper of
MacLane in the Rice journal of 1963 on Natural associativity and
commutativity.  I am familiar with little else.  This pretty much
identifies the scope of my question.

The language of operads does not appear in MacLane's paper and I am
wondering how much of MacLane's results have been reworked to
exploit operads and their structures.  Referring to the summary
above, I am curious about the structures that preceed the
introduction of the group \(T(\bigotimes)\).

Patrick Dehornoy has some results on relating Thompson's groups to  
coherence in monoidal categories and the like. The papers that spring  
to mind are:

The structure group for the associativity identity;  J. P. Appl.  
Algebra 111 (1996) 59-82;

Geometric presentations for Thompson's groups;  Journal of Pure and  
Applied Algebra, 203 (2005) 1-44

Both of these can be found on his webpage at http:// 
www.math.unicaen.fr/~dehornoy/papers.html

Best regards,
Jon

Dear All,

Where does the Grothendieck construction come from ? What is the original 
reference ? Here is the construction.

Take a functor H:I-->Cat (the category of small categories)

The objects are the pairs (i,a) where a is an object of H(i).
A morphism (i,a)-->(j,b) consists of a morphism f:i-->j of I and a morphism  
H(f)(a)-->b of H(j).

Symposium Location

The 20th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium will be held in
the facilities of Venice International University, located on the
island of San Servolo, about 10 minutes by water ferry from the Piazza
San Marco.

Instructions for Participants

Although submission is open to anyone, attendance is by invitation.
All authors of accepted papers are invited to attend, and authors are
required to ensure that at least one will be present. This year's
meeting location will allow us to invite more participants than
previous years.

Submission Instructions

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have
been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with published proceedings. Papers should be submitted in
Postscript or Portable Document Format (PDF). Papers submitted in a
proprietary word processor format such as Microsoft Word cannot be
considered. At least one coauthor of each accepted paper is required
to attend CSF to present the paper.

Papers may be submitted using the two-column IEEE Proceedings style
available for various document preparation systems at IEEE-CS
Press. Papers in this style should be at most 12 pages long, not
counting bibliography and well-marked appendices. Alternatively,
papers can be in Springer LLNCS style. In LLNCS style papers must be
at most 20 pages long excluding the bibliography and well-marked
appendices.

Committee members are not required to read appendices, and so the
paper must be intelligible without them. Papers not adhering to the
page limits will be rejected without consideration of their merits.

The paper submission website will be open in January 2007.

Proposals for panels are also welcome. They should be no more than
five pages in length and should include possible panelists and an
indication of which of those panelists have confirmed a desire to
participate. They should be submitted by email to the program chair by
March 15, 2007.

A session of five-minute talks was successful in the last two years,
so we are likely to have one again in 2007. Abstracts will be
solicited in May.

Because Grothendieck made many constructions that 
became iconic, the terminology is ambiguous. 
I call this construction 
      "the Grothendieck semi-direct product"
because the formula for composition of these 
morphisms is exactly the same as in the very special 
case where I is a group.
Of course the result of the construction is a single 
category "fibered" over I and every fibred category 
so arises.
The original example for me (1959) was that from 
Cartan-Eilenberg where I is a category of rings and
H(i) is the category of modules over i.  Because 
J. L. Kelley had proposed "galactic" as the analogue
at the Cat level of the traditional "local" at the level 
of a space, I called such an H a "galactic cluster" .
The "fibration' terminology  and the accompanying
results and definitions for descent etc were presented 
by AG in Paris seminars in the very early 1960's and 
can probably be accessed elecronically now.

Best wishes
Bill

Dear Colleagues:

We would like to announce the following:

==============================================================
A Fields Institute Sponsored Workshop

Recent advances in category theory and logic:
Applications of traces to algebra, analysis and
categorical logic

University of Ottawa
April 28-30, 2007

URL:  http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~scpsg/Fields07/Fields07.traces.html

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The abstract theory of traces has had a fundamental impact on a variety of
fields within mathematics. These range from functional analysis and
noncommutative geometry to topology and knot theory, and more recently to
logic and theoretical computer science. The theory of traced monoidal
categories, due to Joyal, Street and Verity, is an attempt to unify various
notions of trace that occur in these diverse branches of mathematics. More
recent developments include several theories of partial traces in monoidal
categories.

The Logic and Foundations of Computing Group at the University of Ottawa, with
funding from the Fields Institute, is proud to host a workshop to explore
these topics. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers in
these fields to look for common developments, models, and applications of
trace theory. Among the applications are various notions of parametrized
traces arising in operator algebras, in the theory of feedback and recursion
in theoretical computer science, in braid closure in knot theory, and in
dynamics of proofs as expressed by Linear Logic and the Geometry of
Interaction.

Some invited speakers include:

Samson Abramsky (Oxford)
Robin Cockett (Calgary)
Andre Joyal (UQAM)
Louis Kauffman (Illinois)
Mathias Neufang (Carleton)
Timothy Porter (Bangor)

We will be announcing further speakers shortly. This is intended to be a
workshop, with student participation in mind, including introductory lectures.
We will have some funding for student travel and accommodation. Students
interested in receiving financial aid should contact the organizers by January
30th.

Anyone interested in attending or contributing a talk should contact us by the
same date.

We hope to see you there.

The organizers:

Phil Scott (phil@site.uottawa.ca)
Rick Blute (rblute@uottawa.ca)
Pieter Hofstra (hofstrap@cpsc.ucalgary.ca)

Dear Bill,

Your reply is slightly ambiguous.

Do you mean that you call it the semidirect product by extension of the
semi-direct product in group theory?

Keith Bowden

Has anybody considered (and are there any references with standard results)
categories that do *not* have *all* pullbacks
but nevertheless have some nice exactness properties?

For example, instead of saying that regular epis are stable under pullback
(so that the pullback of a regular epi along any map is also regular-epic),
I might say that any pullback of a regular epi is regular-epic *if* it exists.
(I might instead use a weaker variant, requiring this only in the case
that *all* pullbacks of the regular epi in question exist;
or else requiring that all pullbacks of *all* regular epis exist,
yielding a stronger variant).

For a more specific example, the category of smooth manifolds
misses many pullbacks but has the property above (at least the weaker form;
as I recall, the surjective submersions are precisely those regular epis
that have all pullbacks, but I forget if any other regular epis exist;
in any case, the pullback of a surjective submersion along any smooth map
exists and is also surjective-submersive).

Perhaps I should add that Saunders Mac Lane was always a bit unhappy
with this terminology, and has told me repeatedly that "he knew it long
before Grothendieck...".

Dear Keith,

This reply to the reply is actually more ambiguous... What do you mean
with "extension"?

Anyway, I find it interesting, in the groupoids case, the paper:

"Categorical non abelian cohomology, and the Schreier theory of groupoids",
V. Blanco, M. Bullejos, E. Faro,

on the arXiv as math.CT/0410202.

Best regards,
Beppe Metere.

grothendieck notion of strict epi (SGA4) is equivalent to the notion of
regular epi in the presence of the kernel-pair, but it makes
sense in the absence of pull-backs.

you can say that a strict epi is "stable under pullbacks" also in the
absence of pullbacks:

                     Z_i -------> X
                      |           |
                      |f_i        |f
                     \/     h     \/
                      Z --------> Y

a strict epi  f  is  universal  if  given any  h  there exists a strict
epi family f_i as indicated in the diagram.

this exactness property is as good as stability under pullbacks

see the links

http://arXiv.org/abs/math/0612727

i am afraid thought that you have different examples in mind.

> "he knew it long before Grothendieck..."

So maybe the construction itself is obvious, particularly if you know the
semi-direct product or some other specialization (of the general
construction).

But the intrinic characterization of what the construction yields, that is,
the definition of a fibration, seems less obvious.

I'm sure everyone has a favorite example of that.  For example, Carsten
Fuhrmann gave an intrinsic description of the Kleisli category of a monad
only in 1999.  His home page is:

Dear colleagues,

The terminology
			"Grothendieck semi-direct product"
is just to reduce terminological ambiguity. For example, if a colloquium
talk is advertised by a title that includes the term "Grothendieck
construction", should we expect that it will involve the process of
passing from a galactic cluster to the associated fibration? No, not
necessarily, because that term is also routinely applied in other ways,
for example to his construction in K-theory.

	That Grothendieck construction within K-theory is also
tautological (the reflection of rigs into commutative rings), but
Grothendieck realized that it could have profound content: unlike the
cases taught in junior high school, the adjunction map can degrade
information, with the useful result that the ring becomes more calculable,
while still determining the rank of a module  at each point of a parameter
space; the successes of his approach led to further dissemination of the
philosophy that for measuring the objects in some category, the rigs that
are appropriate depend on the category.

	The principle that seemingly simple constructions can have
profound content was demonstrated many times by Grothendieck, not only by
the idea of K-theory, but by the fibered category concept of the present
discussion.

	The universal semi-direct product formula, (defining the
composition of pairs of the kind <actor, element acted upon>) was long
known in group theory. That it describes the total category of a galactic
cluster may well have been known to some before 1960, but the realization
and popularization of new geometrical applications justify attaching
Grothendieck's name to this kind of semi-direct product.

	Certain fibered categories, under names like "covariance system",
are a key ingredient giving operator theory a content that transcends the
study of linear operators as such. For example, on a base category of
smooth spaces we can consider for each X the category (with one object)
A(X) of smooth functions under multiplication. Then in the total category
one can recognize the "Canonical Commutation Relations" between q in a
fiber and m in the base (special operators p arise as limits of difference
quotients of families of such m). Despite the continuing restrictive
influence of Klein's "Erlanger Programm", one can note that m need NOT be
invertible; paths, inclusion maps, projections, etc. are typically maps m
in the base that can also operate on the q's. In this sense, the fibered
category is an extension of the group case.

By "the original definition", you mean the definitions here?:
 Michael Barr, Exact categories,
 in Exact Categories and Categories of Sheaves,
 Lecture Notes in Mathematics 236, Springer-Verlag, 1971.
I've never read this, since you-exact categories are now standard,
but I guess that one should always go back to the source!

My recollection is that in the original definition only pullbacks of
regular epis as well as kernel pairs were assumed to exist.  Although you
could just assume that when the pullback of a regular epi exists it is a
regular epic, I think that would vitiate the definition.  However, one
possibility that I have known of for a long time but not written about is
to suppose that when A --> B is regular epic and B' --> B is arbitrary and
you look at all pairs A' --> A, A' --> B' that make the evident square
commute, then the family of all those A' --> B' is an effective epic
family.  In that category, a pullback, if it exists, is terminal.

Bill Lawvere has drawn my attention to a significant
moment in the history of the application of the ideas
of algebraic theories to computer science of which
I was quite unaware. In 1967 Eilenberg gave the four
Colloquium Lectures at the Summer Meeting of the AMS
in Toronto. Available details are as follows.

August 29-September 1, 1967, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Samuel Eilenberg, Columbia University.
Universal algebras and the theory of automata.

Contrary to what one might suppose this material
did not appear in any of the books or papers of
Eilenberg or his collaborators; but lecture notes
were distributed at the meeting. Does anyone have
a copy which they could make available?

The notes would be of great interest right now
from a historical point of view for a paper
by John Power and me. But it seems likely that
formulations in the notes would be of wider interest
as by the time (at least) of the notes it seems that
Eilenberg had digested the material in Lawvere's thesis.

In hope,
Martin Hyland

Of course I meant the definition in LNM#236.  However, I don't have the
original source at home anyway, so I would have to wait to check it.

Title : Towards an homotopy theory of process algebra

Abstract : This paper proves that labelled flows are expressive enough to
contain all process algebras which are a standard model for concurrency. More
precisely, we construct the space of execution paths and of higher
dimensional homotopies between them for every process name of every process
algebra with any synchronization algebra using a notion of labelled flow.
This interpretation of process algebra satisfies the paradigm of higher
dimensional automata: one non-degenerate full $n$-dimensional cube (no more
no less) in the underlying space of the time flow corresponding to the
concurrent execution of $n$ actions. This result will enable us in future
papers to develop an homotopical approach of process algebras. Indeed,
several homological constructions related to the causal structure of time
flow are possible only in the framework of flows.

Of course, it is the same if we are talking of the same thing. That we
are.

When I say "strict", I mean it in the sense of SGA4 Expose I, 10.2 10.3,
and we should assume that it coincides with what M. Barr calls
"effective". Contrary to M. Barr terminology, "effective" is also utilizad
in SGA4, presicely, when the kernel pair exists !

Concerning the above notion (*) of "stability under pull-backs without
pull-backs" (an instance of "universality"), it is also defined in
SGA4 Expose II 2.5, and it is simply the following:

an arrow F: X ---> Y (singleton family) is a strict universal epimorphism
if it is a cover for the canonical topology.

In Proposition 2.6 it is stablished the characterization of strict
universal epimorphisms by the property (*) above.

e.d.

hello:

Given a set CC of objects in a topos EE, consider the following property:

      " X no= empty  iff  exists C \in CC, hom(C, X) no= empty "

example; CC = a set of generators

Has (this property) already  a name ?

If not, can you suggest one ?

Any answer will be welcome.

(Notice that if CC is a set of points (instead of objects) we say that
there are enough points)

Thanks          Eduardo J. Dubuc

I have very sad news for the categorical community.
Max Kelly died yesterday 26 January 2007.
I believe it was a heart attack.

Dear Eduardo and everybody:

In one of your papers you used the term
Nullstellensatz for a special case (in some
sense an "algebraically closed"case). I
propose to use that term in this more
general case.

The parameters for various
traditional cases can be perhaps expessed
by an essential connected morphism of
toposes E->S. That is, a full inclusion of
"relatively discrete" into "relatively
 continuous" which has both left adjoint
("connected components") and right adjoint
("points").

In that context there is a natural map from
points to components; if it is epic, we can
say that the Nullstellensatz holds for
E->S.

If S is just the category of abstract sets,
one could think of E as algebraically closed if
the Nullstellensatz holds.

But as seems implicit in Galois theory, for
algebraic geometry over a non-algebraically
closed K, the appropriate base topos S consists
not of abstract sets, but rather of sheaves
on C = the opposite of the category of finite
extensions of K, with every map covering. If E
is the topos of sheaves on (finitely generated
K-algebras )^op with respect to a topology that
restricts to the above on C, I believe
we have a classical example of both your
formulation and mine.

Bill

PS There are other stronger results that also
could be called  Nullstellensatz, involving
another topos F between E and S, such as
the one generated by algebras that are finite
dimensional as K-vector spaces, or one
suggested by Birkhoff's SDI theorem. What
is the appropriate statement for these results ?

I am deeply saddened by the loss of Max. In our field he was a rock of
reliability and a fountain of imagination. I will miss my lively, warm,
kind, and sometimes mischievous friend.

I am deeply saddened by the death of Max Kelly. When I saw the subject in
Ross posting, and before opening the message, my heart already felt
anguish. I am more saddened with his loss that what I have been by the
loss of any other member of our category theory community. In fact, I
loved Max. I admired his courage, his independence of thought, his lack of
hypocrisy, and I loved him simply by the way he was. I am proud that he
considered me his friend. For me, our community is not the same without
Max.

Gregory Maxwell Kelly was one of the great mathematicians of our time, so
perfect in his research and vision of mathematics, and in every aspect of
academic life. And he was so exceptionally kind to everyone. It is hard to
imagine that Max is not with us anymore, and it is a great pain for his
family and for all of us, his friends and colleagues...

We would like to add to Bill and Eduardo's letters also our feelings of
deep sadness at Max's death.

Max Kelly's Last Work
=====================
In due course Max's last work will appear in a four-author paper. While
it is not usual for coauthors to divulge who contributed what to a paper
the present circumstances seem to warrant such, as an appreciation of Max's
extraordinary talents and tenacity.

Carboni, Kelly, Walters, and Wood, [CKWW] have for some time been extending
the  Carboni and Walters notion of `cartesian bicategory' to the general case
of bicategories that are not necessarily locally ordered. A cartesian
bicategory B ultimately has a tensor product, a pseudofunctor *:BxB--->B
that is naively associative and unitary. It is natural to ask whether
such (B,*) is a monoidal bicategory, in other words a one-object tricategory
in the sense of [Coherence for Tricategories; Gordon, Power, and Street]=[GPS].

Early in 2005 [CKWW] had shown that _if_ a bicategory A with finite `products'
-x- and 1, in the bilimit sense, has (A,x) a monoidal bicategory then a
cartesian bicategory B has (B,*) monoidal. In the course of polishing the
paper it came to Max's attention that nobody had _proved_ the

Theorem: A bicategory with finite products is monoidal.

Nobody doubted the truth of this. In fact, experts in higher dimensional
category theory said that if it were not true then the definition of
tricategory is wrong! But when you consider the rather large amount of data
that must be assembled and the many equations (some merely implicit in
words such as pseudonatural and modification) that must be verified from
the apparently rather weak universal property of finite products in the
bilimit sense, it seemed like a rather thankless task to write out the
details. This was to Max a completely unacceptable state of affairs. If
nobody doubts the statement then it must be possible to find a good proof!

Now Max had no intention of redrawing any of the diagrams in [GPS]. For
the last few years Max, with little central vision left as a result of macular
degeneration, has been doing Mathematics using an 8-fold magnification monitor.
This allowed him to see only a few square centimetres of a page at a time.
Many [GPS] diagrams consume an entire page. His proof, that we were privileged
to receive in the last few weeks, has _no_ diagrams (though doubtless we will
incorporate a few in a publishable version of the paper).

Max attributed the key idea in his proof to Ross Street. Briefly, this is
how it goes: For X a finite family of objects in the bicategory A, write A(X)
for the bicategory of product cones over X. Thus an object of A(X) consists
of an object b of A, together with a family of arrows p_i:b--->X_i, such that
for all a, the induced functor A(a,b)--->\Pi A(a,X_i) is an equivalence of
categories.

Lemma: !:A(X)--->1 is a biequivalence

(Recall that to say B--->1 is a biequivalence is to say that:
i) there is an object b in B
ii) for any objects c and d in B, there is an arrow f:c--->d
iii) for any arrows g,h:c--->d in B, there is a unique 2-cell g--->h.

It follows that in a bicategory biequivalent to 1, every arrow is an
equivalence and every 2-cell is an isomorphism.)

Next, Max observes that if A has finite products then, for any B, the
bicategory [B,A] of pseudofunctors, pseudonatural transformations, and
modifications also has finite products, given `pointwise' by the products
of A. -x- is an object of [A^2,A]. We can use (a x b) x c  and  a x (b x c)
as names for objects in [A^3,A] and applying the Lemma to [A^3,A](a,b,c)
deduce the existence of the associator equivalence, pseudonatural in a,b,
and c. The associator gives rise to two arrows (abbreviating somewhat)
((ab)c)d ===> a(b(cd)) in [A^4,A](a,b,c,d) and between these we have a
unique invertible modification, the \pi of [GPS]. The coherence of \pi is
chiefly the Stasheff non-abelian 4-cocycle condition (again see [GPS])
and for this we need only apply the Lemma to [A^5,A](a,b,c,d,e) to see
that the two modifications in question are equal. Of course the other data
and equations are handled with similar appeals to the Lemma.

Max was not content to stop here. In his last few days he had been learning
the rather subtle definition of _symmetric_ monoidal bicategory and
constructed the requisite braiding equivalence and syllepsis isomorphism
for a bicategory with finite products. Everything follows from the universal
property but Max has shown us _how_ so that we can calculate with these
things. His insights show us the way to deal with coherence issues arising
from birepresentability generally and weak n-representability when the need
arises. Max's personal copy of [GPS] was autographed by Ross with the words
``To Max Kelly, a master of coherence''. Yes, he was.

The European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
(ETAPS) is the primary European forum for academic and industrial
researchers working on topics related to Software Science. It is a
confederation of five main conferences, several satellite workshops
and other events.

ETAPS 2007 is taking place in Braga, Portugal. Braga, capital of the
Minho province, is an ancient city in the heart of the green and
fertile region known as the Costa Verde. The region is known for its
attractiveness in terms of climate, gastronomy, prices, and
culture. Braga is known for its barroque churches and splendid 18th

I've just become aware that some folks may still believe, in error, that
some variation of the now defunct e-mail address

0004142427/FEJLINTON@MCIMAIL.COM

remains valid for me (perhaps name only, or number only, w/ or w/o leading zeros).

Please be aware that, as of the end of 30 June 2003, MCI Mail ceased to
exist, the restructuring of MCI/WorldCom having cut off its life-support.

Instead, please use my university e-mail address, which is

FLinton@Wesleyan.edu ,

or the secondary, back-up, address:

fejlinton@usa.net .

Many thanks.  -- Fred Linton

Dear Max,

I feel deeply sad that you have left.
Now that you are gone, I realise how much you mean to me.
I regret not telling you that.
I wish to repair that by writing you this letter.
If I send it to Imogen and to your friends,
it will reach you in some way.

Your work has been a constant source of inspiration for me.
It combines beauty, rigor and depth.
It is fundamental, I use it every day.
It will last forever.
You were a great mathematician.

I also want to thank you for inviting me to Australia.
I did some of my best work there.
You were a great host.
I made many friends.

I wish we could meet again.
I will talk with you in my dreams.

Yours, Andre

Max Kelly was not only a power house of categorical understanding, but
he also taught us how to combine beauty with rigour and thoroughness in
his mathematical writings (see, for example, Richard Wood's recent
message!) and thereby rendered an enormous service to the reputation of
category theory.

In addition to creating a world centre for categories at Sydney, with his
willingness to spend long periods of time at numerous places in the world
he was (together with Saunders Mac Lane) also the prime ambassador for
category theory for many years in many countries, where he would not only
give plenty of his time but also never fail to fully engage himself in the
local language and culture.

Early in my career I had the great privilege to benfit from Max's visits
in Germany. Like many others, I will always remain very grateful to him
for everything that I learned from him at that time, and for being such a
candid and inspiring leader in our community for over forty years.

Walter Tholen.
