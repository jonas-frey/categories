I think it important to note that tensor products have no universal
mapping property and no categorical definition.  Given an internal hom,
there might or might not be a tensor product that provides a left adjoint
for it.  Given a bifunctor, there might or might not be an internal hom
(or two if the bifunctor is not symmetric) right adjoint to it.

Another point is that the tensor product on abelian groups (or modules
over any commutative right) has two universal mapping properties: It
provides left adjoints for the quite obvious (but still not categorically
defined) internal hom and also represents the functor that takes A to the
functor of bilinear maps out of A x B.

In any case, it makes no sense to ask what is the "right" tensor product.
The right tensor product will be the one that is appropriate to the job
you want to do with it.

Jeff Egger gave a talk on some of these ideas at the Nice PSSL - I'm
somewhat surprised he hasn't replied to this thread. IIRC, the category
of operator algebras is an involutive monoidal category with respect to
one or other of the tensor products, and C*-algebras are exactly the
involutive monoids w.r.t. this tensor product. Can't remember which one
it was, though.

The following preprint is available:

M. Grandis, Collared cospans, cohomotopy and TQFT (Cospans in
Algebraic Topology, II)

Abstract. Topological cospans and their concatenation, by pushout,
appear in the theories of tangles, ribbons, cobordism, etc. Various
algebraic invariants have been introduced for their study, which it
would be interesting to link with the standard tools of Algebraic
Topology, (co)homotopy and (co)homology functors.

	Here we introduce collared cospans between topological spaces, as a
generalisation of the cospans which appear in the previous theories.
Their interest lies in the fact that their concatenation is realised
with homotopy pushouts. Therefore, cohomotopy functors induce
'functors' from collared cospans to spans of sets, providing - by
linearisation - topological quantum field theories (TQFT) on
manifolds and their cobordisms. Similarly, (co)homology and homotopy
functors take collared cospans to relations of abelian groups or (co)
spans of groups, yielding other 'algebraic' invariants.

	This is the second paper in a series devoted to the study of cospans
in Algebraic Topology. It is practically independent from the first,
which deals with higher cubical cospans in abstract categories. The
third article will proceed from both, studying cubical topological
cospans and their collared version.

I'm usually too shy to post to the mailing list, so I wrote Bas Spitters
a personal reply instead.  In this case, though, I have to set the
record straight...

The category of operator _spaces_ admits a (non-trivial) involutive monoidal
structure---by which I mean a (non-commutative) monoidal structure together
with a _covariant_ involution that reverses the order of tensoring.
[Regarding a monoidal category as a one-object bicategory B, this means
that the involution relates B with B^{op} rather than with B^{co}.]
The tensor product is called the _Haagerup_ tensor product, and the
involution I considered is the so-called _opposite_ operator space
structure applied to the conjugate vector space.  I had conjectured that
involutive monoids in this involutive monoidal category (which, for the
purposes of this mail, I shall call involutive operator algebras) are
the same as C*-algebras, but eventually I discovered a counter-example
which showed that involutive operator algebras are strictly more general
than C*-algebras.  (This was the direction which had less concerned me!)
I apologise to anyone to whom I failed to mention this counter-example.

Cheers,
Jeff.

Hi -

One of you must know the answer to this!

Suppose we have a weak pullback (= pseudo-pullback) square of
groupoids:

G -> H
|    |
v    v
K -> L

Suppose we take presheaves on all four.  We can get a square

hom(G^{op},Set) -> hom(H^{op},Set)
      ^                 ^
      |                 |
hom(K^{op},Set) -> hom(L^{op},Set)

where the arrows pointing forward - in the same direction as
the original arrows - are defined using pushforward, and the arrows
pointing backward are defined using pullback.

Does this square commute up to natural isomorphism?  Do you
know a reference somewhere?

Some side remarks:

1) This seems related to the "Beck-Chevalley condition".

2) It may work for categories as well as groupoids, but I happen to
need it only for groupoids.

3) I really need it with the category Vect replacing Set, so
if you know a general result for any sufficiently nice category
playing the role of Set here, that would be wonderful.

Best,
jb

Dear Michael,

This email is suggested by your announcement at (
http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/) of  papers on pasting and computads.

First, I hope it is useful to direct people to an early paper with a
definition of strict omega-categories, there called \infty-categories:
(with P.J. HIGGINS), ``The equivalence of $\infty$-groupoids
and crossed  complexes'', {\em Cah. Top. G\'eom. Diff.} 22 (1981)
371-386.
www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/pdffiles/x-comp.pdf
The main emphasis of this paper is  the equivalence in the title. Because
crossed complexes C have a classifying space BC which can also be
represented as a fibration over B\pi_1 C with fibre a topological abelian
group (in fact the classifying space of a chain complex) this implies that
the homotopy type of spaces represented by \infty-groupoids is limited. This
observation suggested to Grothendieck in 1982 the need to move to weak
\infty-categories (or groupoids) for dealing with matters of nonabelian
cohomology, which for him was a long standing aim. It was not till I met him
in 1986 that I  convinced him that strict n-fold groupoids really did model
all weak homotopy n-types, (Loday), at which he exclaimed `That is
absolutely beautiful!' There is still work to do on the connections with
nonabelian cohomology! And crossed complexes, though limited,  are certainly
useful for this, because of their close relation to chain complexes with
operators. (for a survey on crossed complexes, see  math.AT/0212274).

Second, I would like to raise some general questions on multiple
compositions and what is or should be the mathematics to deal with these.
For 2-categories, this seems to be pasting schemes. However the thrust of my
work since the 1970s has been to Higher Homotopy van Kampen theorems,
(HHvKTs) based on the question of the possible use of groupoids in higher
homotopy theory, given their success in 1-dimensional homotopy theory. The
key aim was to use cubical methods, because these gave a convenient
`algebraic inverse to subdivision', through the use of multiple
compositions, modelling steps in the proof of the usual vKT for groupoids.

Such HHvKTs were proved with Philip Higgins in dimension 2 in 1978, in all
dimensions (for crossed complexes) in 1981, and with Jean-Louis Loday in
1987 (for cat^n groups and so crossed n-cubes of group). All these theorems
have algebraic implications for homotopy types which seem unobtainable by
other means. The theorems with PJH use directly `algebraic inverse to
subdivision', while the proof with Loday uses some sophisticated algebraic
topology and simplicial methods (Waldhausen, Zisman, Puppe and some new
results). The work  obtains to a limited  extent a vision of Grothendieck of
what he termed `integration of homotopy types'; there are strong
connectivity assumptions so the theorems do not allow calculation of
everything, e.g. homotopy groups of spheres, and so some have said `the
theory has not fullfilled its promise' (report on a failed research
proposal). On the other hand, the theory does come within the scope of
`higher dimensional nonabelian methods for local-to-global problems', and
the new explicit calculations enabled and relations with combinatorial group
theory (e.g. the nonabelian tensor product of groups, bibiliography now of
90 items, http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonabtens.html) are pointers to
its success.

Possibly relevant to this is that I have never been able to write down a
proof of even the 2-dimensional HHvKT using 2-groupoids; and it would not
have been, or at least was not,  even conjectured in those terms.

My preference is for algebraic models of homotopy types which lead to some
explicit algebraic computations (hence the HHvKTs),  to new theorems, and
new relations with other areas.

My overall questions are therefore:
(i) to what extent can and should cubical methods be used in weak category
theory?
(ii) is there some operadic or other method from current ideas on higher
category theory which allows the use of `algebraic inverses to subdivision'
in all dimensions?
(iii) to what extent are these operadic methods generally useful in higher
dimensional nonabelian methods for local-to-global problems? (I first heard
of the term local-to-global problems from Dick Swan, when we worked on his
lecture notes on the Theory of Sheaves, Oxford, 1958.)

Of course subdivision allows the passage from global to local. The problem
is the converse, a key problem in maths and science (even biology and
engineering!). Anything which helps in this seems to me a Good Thing!

Greetings and Good Luck,

Ronnie Brown

Hi,

I was wondering if you are aware of any bibliographies, reviews, or papers
relating category theory to biology - mathematical biology, systems
biology, computational biology or bioinformatics.

I would be interested in papers relating category theory to areas of
knowledge representation or other areas of computer science used in
abovementioned areas.

Please feel free to email me in person if you wish not to overburden the
mailing list.

Regards,
Deniz Kural

2-cell in the third square is invertible. See Rene Guitart's
early work on exact squares.

Hi,

1.You may want to look at the writings of Robert Rosen (a Google search
will provide the necessary links).

2. For a different direction, and on a far more modest note, you may try
looking at some of my papers on my web page:

http://www.actcom.co.il/typographics/zippie

Of course I will be very intrested to hear your comments about that.

Good luck,

Zippie

The first time the term "category theory" (I mean, exactly that term)
appeared in Mathemtical Reviews was in the review of

Rosen, R. [1961]: `A relational theory of  the structural changes
induced in biological systems by alterations in  environment', {\em
Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics} \bf 23}, pp.~165--71.

The full review reads:

The author uses, among other things, some previous results from his
biologico-mathematical applications of abstract category theory [#B416]
in order to further develop another paper concerning relational biology
[#B418]. Some biological applications are treated; e.g., an
interpretation of the mitotic cycle.

Rosen's earlier related works are reviewed as dealing with "the theory
of categories."

best, Colin

In answer to Deniz Kural

With Jean-Paul Vanbremeersch we have been developing a model for
biological and neural systems based on category theory called Memory
Evolutive Systems. Since 20 years we have published a series of papers
on this subject, most of which are posted on our Internet site
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/vbm-ehr
Recently we have written a book on this subject:
Memory Evolutive sytems: hierarchy, emergence, cognition"
  due to appear this month in the series "Studies in
Multidisciplinarity" of Elsevier (volume 4).

Sincerely
Andree C. Ehresmann

A new "heteromorphic" treatment of adjoint functors provides applications to
biology such as an abstract characterization of selectionist (as opposed to
instructionist) mechanisms as in Darwin's evolutionary theory, the
selectionist theory of the immune system, and neural darwinism (e.g.,
Edelman's and Changeux's work). Heteromorphisms, e.g., the injection of a
set of generators into the free group on the set, can be formally treated in
category theory using bifunctors Het:X^op x A--> Set analogous to the usual
Hom:X^op x X-->Set. When the heteromorphisms from objects in a category X to
objects in a category A can represented in each of the categories, then the
functors giving the representing objects are a pair of adjoint functors and
the representations give a pair of natural isomorphisms:

Hom_A(Fx,a) = Het(x,a) = Hom-_X(x,Ga).

The usual treatment of adjoints leaves out the middle term. And all adjoint
functors can be shown to arise in this manner (up to isomorphism). The
applications were not available in the usual treatment of adjoints where the
heteromorphisms were not explicit.

The applications are outlined in a paper just published in Axiomathes (2007)
17: 19-39. A reprint can be retreived from my website:
http://www.ellerman.org/Davids-Stuff/Maths/Adjoints-Axiomathes-Reprint.pdf .
A rather long (and impenetrable) treatment of the math was in the recent
"What is Category Theory" collection of papers (2006: Polimetrica). A short
straightforward treatment of the math is available on the ArXiv:
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2207v1 .

Other applications of category theory to biology have been made by Robert
Rosen (as mentioned by several posts) and by Andree Ehresmann.

Best, David

Fellow category theorists,

The 86th edition of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will =20=

be held at the Institut =C9lie Cartan of the Universit=E9 Henri Poincar=E9=
 =20
in Nancy, on the weekend of September 8-9 2007.

More details will be announced later this summer, but interested =20
people can start contacting me now. We intend to continue the PSSL =20
tradition of informality, and scheduling talks pertaining to any =20
aspect of category theory, with or without applications in natural =20
science, logic, computer science, or other branches of mathematics.

The fast TGV-Est  train line will be inaugurated in June, and the =20
Paris-Nancy trip will then take only 1h30m, with easy connections to =20
the two Paris airports. The city of Nancy is right on the Paris-=20
Munich train line, and also has good train connecftions with the =20
north (Luxembourg, Brussels and Frankfurt via Metz) and the south =20
(Lyon, Nice...). There is a local airport, 45 minutes away from =20
downtown by minibus shuttle, and there are also two relatively close =20
international airports, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, which often allow =20
you to do the airport-dowtown Nancy trip in less than 2h30m.

Nancy is of considerable interest for the mathematical tourist, being =20=

the birthplace of Henri Poincar=E9, and being intimately related to the =20=

career of Nicolas Bourbaki.  It has two historical old towns: the =20
medieval one, with the Renaissance palace of the Dukes of Lorraine, =20
and the classical one, with UNESCO World heritage sites built by Duke =20=

Stanislas. It is can also boast one of the highest concentrations of =20
Art Nouveau architecture in all of Europe, rivalling Prague and =20
Barcelona.


Hoping to see you in September,

Fran=E7ois Lamarche

Regarding Deniz Kural's question about references to papers on category
theory and biology, Tom Caudell and I have been investigating a semantic
theory for neural networks both biological and artificial, cognitive and
non-cognitive.  We are designing and conducting experiments to test and
refine the theory in both neuroscience and cognitive psychology working
with colleagues in those disciplines.  An initial paper on the theory is

M. J. Healy and T. P. Caudell (2006)
Ontologies and Worlds in Category Theory: Implications for Neural Systems=
,
Axiomathes, vol. 16, nos. 1-2, pp. 165-214.

The only experiment appearing in a publication to date is one on an
artificial neural network application, presented at IJCNN 2005 in Montrea=
l
(the results were presented also at CT06).

Mike Healy

                  IFM2007: INTEGRATED FORMAL METHODS
                        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                         2nd to 5th July 2007
                    St Anne's College, Oxford, UK
                           www.ifm2007.org


The design and analysis of computing systems presents a significant
challenge: systems need to be understood at many different levels of
abstraction, and examined from many different perspectives. Formal
methods - languages, tools, and techniques with a sound, mathematical
basis - can be used to develop a thorough understanding, and to support
rigorous examination.

Further research into effective integration is required if these
methods are to have a significant impact outside academia. The IFM
series of conferences seeks to promote that research, to bring
together the researchers carrying it out, and to disseminate the
results of that research among the wider academic and industrial
community.

This is the sixth IFM conference.  It will be held in the historic
university town of Oxford, at St Anne's College - one of the larger
colleges of the University, with excellent new conference
facilities. Oxford is easily reached from most UK cities, and is 70
minutes from the country's largest airport.  Earlier conferences in
the series were held at York (1999), Schloss Dagstuhl (2000), Turku
(2002), Kent (2004), and Eindhoven (2005).

The conference runs for three full days, 3rd to 5th July. Invited
speakers include Jifeng He on "UTP Semantics for Web Services" and
Daniel Jackson on "Recent Advances in Alloy"; a third invited speaker
is yet to be confirmed. There are 32 contributed papers, including a
special session on Unifying Theories of Programming. In addition,
there are four satellite events, taking place on 2nd and 3rd July -
three workshops:

  * Refinement Workshop
  * C/C++ Verification
  * MeMoT (Methods, Models and Tools for Fault Tolerance)

and a tutorial:

  * KeY (Integrating OO Design and Deductive Verification of Software)

The full programme is available at:

  http://www.ifm2007.org/programme-ifm.html

Registration for the conference is now open, at:

  http://www.ifm2007.org/registration.html

Special early-registration fees apply until 1st June 2007.

Dear Sirs,

Before deciding of using arXiv in a systematic way, I would like that =20=

there be a clear statement of its policy and commitments; a statement =20=

which, likely, the organisers and many of us take as understood and =20
granted, but which I have been unable to find.

To be more explicit, what about the possibility of the system being, =20
in future, exploited economically? What about the possibility of it =20
being sold to a commercial company?

When downloading an article to the arXiv, the author is asked to =20
grant 'a perpetual, non-exclusive license to distribute this =20
article'. I think the author has a right to know that this license =20
will not be used, in the future, for goals which would be in contrast =20=

with the present (understood) ones, or even opposite to them.

Last year I wrote a message in this sense to the list =20
'categories' (categories@mta,ca), where arXiv has been frequently =20
proposed as a way of disseminating articles. In December 2006 there =20
was a discussion about these points in a blog kept by John Baez

    http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/12/=20
arxiv_policy_statement.html

This is part of a posting by John Baez, on this blog:

"Many people like to have some idea of what an organization seeks to =20
do, or is committed to do, before they do business with it.

For this reason, it=92s unusual for such an important entity as the =20
arXiv not to make a public statement about its goals and commitments. =20=

Consider, for example, the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to =20
Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities, and its many signatories, =20
or the statement by the Wellcome Trust supporting open access, or the =20=

Wikimedia mission statement and bylaws, or the Google code of conduct =20=

and privacy policy.  "  (end of citation)

As far as I know, there still is no policy statement available. One =20
can only read, at the head of the 'arXiv Advisory Board' page:

"Please note that all arXiv policy decisions are ultimately made by =20
Cornell University Library."

Will the Cornell University Library make its arXiv policy public?

Hi all,

I think it is relevant to point out that if people who post articles to
the Arxiv agree to grant a permanent, _non-exclusive_ right to distribute the
article,  that means, that if the operators of the Arxiv, whoever
they are, decide to sell copies of the database, or individual articles,
they won't be entitled to prevent anyone else from distributing the
same material for free.  So they can't corner the market on the content,
in other words.

All in all it doesn't seem that big of a concern to me, although certainly
worth a thoughtful discussion.  It would be nice to hear from Cornell
Library about their intentions.

Bill Rowan

Note that Bergen is very busy during the tourist season, so early booking
of accommodation and transportation is recommended.



Main CALCO'07 conference
------------------------
CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference. It brings together
researchers and practitioners to exchange new results related
to foundational aspects and both traditional and emerging uses of
algebras and coalgebras in computer science. The study of algebra
and coalgebra relates to the data, process and structural aspects of
software systems. The accepted papers report results of theoretical work
on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the way these results
can support methods and techniques for software development, as well as
experience with the transition of resulting technologies into industrial
practise. Some main key words are:

     * Abstract models and logics
     * Specialised models and calculi
     * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
     * System specification and verification

The list of accepted papers is available at the web site.


Invited speakers
----------------
Stephen L. Bloom, Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ, USA
Prof. Bloom works on algebraic specification theories and was instrumental
in developing iterative theories, an elaborate coalgebraic method -
predating coalgebras.

Luis Caires, New University of Lisbon, Portugal
Prof. Caires has made important contributions to the field of distributed
and mobile systems, and spatial logics for these.

Barbara K=88=8Fnig, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany
Prof. K=88=8Fnig works on graph transformation systems, with applications
to concurrent and mobile systems, software reliability and security.

Glynn Winskel, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom
Prof. Winskel is well-known for his fundamental work in semantics and
theory of concurrency.


CALCO-jnr (CALCO Young Researchers Workshop)
--------------------------------------------
CALCO-jnr is dedicated to presentations by PhD students and by those who
completed their doctoral studies within the past few years. This year
12 contributions within the theme of CALCO have been accepted. See the
overview on the CALCO-jnr web page on the CALCO web site.

Finite Model Theory and Its Applications
by
Erich Graedel, Phokion G. Kolaitis, Leonid Libkin, Maarten Marx,
Joel Spencer, Moshe Y. Vardi, Yde Venema, and Scott Weinstein

Springer, 2007, 437 pages, hardcover,
ISBN: 978-3-540-00428-8.
(Series: Texts in Theoretical Computer Science. An EATCS Series)

>From the back cover: This book gives a comprehensive overview of central
topics in finite model theory - expressive power of logics, descriptive
complexity, and zero-one laws - together with selected applications
relating to database theory and artificial intelligence, especially
constraint databases and constraint satisfaction problems. The final
chapter provides a concise modern introduction to modal logic,
emphasizing the interaction with finite model theory. The underlying
theme of the book is the use of  first-order, second-order, fixed-point,
and infinitary logic, as well as various fragments of and hierarchies
within these logics, to gain insight into phenomena and problems in
complexity theory and combinatorics.

The book emphasizes the use of combinatorial games, such as extensions
and refinements of the Ehrenfeucht-Fraissi games, as a powerful way to
analyze the expressive power of logics, and illustrates how sophisticated
notions from model theory and combinatorics, such as o-minimality and
treewidth, arise naturally in the applications of finite model theory
to database theory and artificial intelligence.

Students of logic and computer science will find here the tools
necessary to embark on research into finite model theory, and all
readers will experience the excitement of a vibrant area of the
applications of logic to computer science.

There clearly is a connection between hyperdoctrines and cylindric
algebras.

Does anybody knows work that relates the two? Or that makes use of a
result from one area to prove something in the other?

I would be greatful for any reference or comment.

Best wishes,

Alexander

yes, of course. Roughly speaking, they are equivalent: hyperdoctrines
(HDs) are indexed category style algebraization of first order logic
while  cylindric algebras (CAs) are an equivalent fibrational
formulation. To make it precise, we need to consider a few rather
straightforward yet technically bulky generalizations of both notions,
reproducing in HDs the classical context of CAs and vice versa. I'm
traveling and do not have references at hand, but below is an outline
of how it can be done (apologies for possible inaccuracies).

The last question is interesting. If we are speaking about pure
algebra, there is nothing exciting in "switching" between HDs and CAs:
these are just different representation of the same algebraic theory.
More accurately, HDs are equivalent to locally finite CAs, which are
not equationally definable. Thus, HDs are much more manageable
algebraically (but many-sorted). This trade-off between number of
sorts and equational definability is probably the most/only
interesting algebraic point.

However, the main driving force of CA development was in the
representation theorems, which are for CAs are much more intricate
than Stone representation theorems for Boolean algebras.  In the
companion volume  to the classical monograph by Henkin, Monk,Tarsky
(where the great trio is joined by Andreka & Nemeti), there is a lot
of interesting and not-easy-to-prove representation theorems (googling
Andreka-Nemeti should provide references).  I'm not aware of any
similar results (or even interest in such results) for HDs.

ZD

== 8< ==  equivalence of HDs and CAs: a rough outline

Let's fix a countable set V (of variables). Consider a simple version
of the notion of hyperdoctrine, p:T-->BA^op is an indexed cat, where
T=Pow_fin(V) is the category of finite subsets of V and mappings
between them and BA is the category of Boolean algebras. Now we apply
to p the Grothendieck construction and get a fibration \delta: G-->T.
A straitforward check shows that G is a locally finite cylindric
algebra (CA). (Special axioms regulating interactions of substitutions
and bound variables hold because of Beck-Chevalle and Frobenius
conditions).   Conversely, if A is a locally finite cylindric algebra
over V and a\in A, define
\delta(a) = {x \in V| C_x(a) not= a} (C_x is cylindrification
operator/quantifier).  As a Boolean  algebra, A is an order category
and \delta is a fibration. Its indexed version gives an HD over a
trivial algebraic theory (and with Boolean fibres).

To get an equivalence result for non-trivial algebraic theories, the
notion of CA over a variety was introduced (first by Boris Plotkin for
Halmos' polyadic algebras, and then by Janis Cirulis for CAs). To
extend equivalence for the classical HDs where fibres are
intuitionistic, we need the notion of cylindric Heyting algebras. To
extend the equivalence for CAs that are not locally finite, we need
HDs over Ts being cats with any products (not necessary finite).
Another version of equivalence results can be obtained if we replace
CAs by polyadic algebras introduced by Halmos. One more delicate point
is that CAs are equivalent to polyadic algebras with equality while
there are also polyadic algebras without equality.

Such things were popular at Riga algebraic seminar about twenty years
ago. I think that then I wrote a preprint where all this was carefully
formulated; hopefully, I still have a hard copy (never thought that
anybody would need it :).

Hyperdoctrines (in many variants) were introduced as an algebraic
aspect of "proof theory" and as such are definitely not equivalent
to cylindric algebras (or polyadic algebras or even various categorical
formulations of logic). They involve fibered categories whose fibers
are cartesian closed (and with adjoints between the fibers etc.).
The poset reflection of these fibers are Heyting algebras. This
reflection process was intuited already by Curry and was later called
"the Curry-Howard isomorphism" even though this is a serious misnomer
because it is very far from being an isomorphism.

(See my paper Adjoints in and among bi-categories, Logic & Algebra,
Lecture Notes in Pure and Applied Mathematics. 180:181-189.
Ed. A. Ursini, P Agliano, Marcel Dekker, Inc. Basel, 1996,
as well as the author's commentary on my paper Adjointness in
Foundations, as reprinted in TAC.
Recent papers of Matias Menni further clarify these developments,
which were partly inspired by work of Hans Laeuchli.)

Conceptually, the problem of presentation of a theory in algebraic
logic by means of primitive predicates and axioms can be viewed as
taking place in two steps: first the presentation of a hyperdoctrine
with non-trivial fibers, and then the further collapse by imposing
the condition that projection maps act as inverse to diagonal maps
(within each fiber). This process can be localized. The problematic
existential quantifier which is the core problem of proof theory:
("there exists a proof of ....") is thus split into several parts
to be studied separately.

I hope the above helps to clarify the relationship between two
levels of categorical algebra.

I'm afraid that still some clarification is needed. Standard
hyperdoctrines (HDs) and standard cylindric algebras (CAs) are not
equivalent by the following two groups reasons.
(1)    How we model logic/predicates. In HDs, objects in fibers are
predicates of finite arities, the logic is intuitionistic and we are
interested in proofs (arrows) rather than just provability (partial
order). In CAs (of dimension \alpha = enumeration of some predefined
set of variables), elements are to be thought of as predicates of
arity \alpha, the logic is classical and we are interested in the
partial order of provability (CAs are Boolean algebras with an extra
structure).
(2)   How we model algebra/terms. In an HD  T-->Cat^op, the algebraic
base T is an *arbitrary* finitary algebraic theory.  In CAs, the
algebraic base is *the trivial* finitary algebraic theory over \alpha,
whose only operations are projections.

The difference is quite evident , and I believe that the actual
question was not about the difference but rather about how to figure
out the commonalities (and formulate equivalence if it can be
formulated).
Result 1: adjusting HDs to CAs and PAs (polyadic algebras). The
following three notions are equivalent:
-- locally finite CA (of dimension \omega),
-- locally finite PA with equality,
-- HD, whose fibers are Boolean algebras and the algebraic base has no
morphisms other than projections.
The condition of being locally-finite can be removed if we define HDs
over algebraic bases having countable (rather than just finite)
products.
Result 2: adjusting CAs/PAs to HDs. The following three notions are equivalent:
-- HD, whose fibers are posets,
-- locally finite "polyadic Heyting algebra" with equality over a variety,
-- locally finite "cylindric Heyting algebra" over a variety.

Many similar equivalence results in-between and around the two above
can be formulated. Roughly, anything that can be defined for poset HDs
in the fibred fashion, can be reproduced for CA/PAs in the globalistic
fashion (via the Grothendieck construction) and vice versa. However,
the HD formalism is much more flexible as can be seen already from the
two results above. Result 1 is conceptually and technically easy.
Result 2 is equally easy conceptually but is much more intricate
technically. Defining polyadic Heyting  algebras needs a certain
technical work, which is essentially nothing but reproducing the basic
Lawvere's observation of quantifiers as adjounts in the global Heyting
algebra setting.

In general, the  notion of CA of an infinite dimension is conceptually
messy: elements are predicates of infinite arities while quantifiers
and variable substitutions are finitary (and even worse, substitutions
are not a basic notion and need to be derived via diagonals, see Janis
Cirulis' papers. But once again, the main concern of developing CAs
was to algebraize semantics -- algebras of relations, rather than
syntax and proof theory). Halmos' polyadic algebras are conceptually
more consistent in this sense (and probably because in their design
the syntactical side was taken more seriously) .

Despite all these technical differences, HDs are CAs/PAs  are close in
the sense that they both follow the same basic idea of algebraizing
logic: the algebras  are generated by signatures and axioms
(theories). In a bit more detail: a signature \Sigma of operation and
predicate symbols of finite arities freely generates an HD, which is
then factorized by the congruence generated by the axioms (in the
categorical jargon, the result would be called the classifying HD of
the theory).  The "classifying" CA can be also generated in this way
but not freely because expressing finiteness of the arities needs
additional conditions that cannot be captures equationally  (it is a
well-known fact that the class of locally finite CA of an infinite
dimension is not a variety, it is not a quasi-variety too). If we
consider signatures in which all symbols have the same countable arity
\omega, then the corresponding CA is freely generated by \Sigma (and
then factorized by the theory congruence).  The main advantage of HDs
over locally finite CAs is that the finiteness of the arities is
captured equationally (the trade-off is that HDs are algebras over
graphs while CAs are algebras over sets).

Note that the dimension/set of variables is a parameter in the above.
An essentially different way of algebraizing logic is when variables
are generators while the signature is a parameter. Semantically it
means that a model is an evaluation of variables, another evaluation,
even in the same carrier set, is another model. This is how validity
of implications is defined. Theories in such logic are congruences (in
contrast to Birkhoff's fully invariant congruences, when we talk about
the equational logic), and we may call this way of algebraizing logic
"congruental" (the term introduced by Blok and Pigozzi in their
seminal work on algebraic logic).

If Sign denotes a category of signatures and Log is a category of
logics algebraically defined in a suitable way, then the HDs/CAs' way
of algebraizing logic can be presented as a binary functor Sign x
Set^op --> Log (signature elements are generators, the set of
variables is a parameter).  In congruental logic, we have a dual
situation described by a functor Set x Sign^op --> Log (variables are
generators, the signature is a parameter).
Details can be found in my paper
http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zdiskin/Pubs/WAAL-97.pdf
full of conjectures (deep insights are also possible :-).

Dear all,

This is to announce the availability of a preprint

"Infinitesimal cubical structure, and higher connections"

The preprint can be downloaded from

http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4406

or from my home page

http://home.imf.au.dk/kock/

In the context of Synthetic Differential Geometry, we describe a
notion of higher connection with values in a cubical groupoid. We do
this by exploiting a certain structure of cubical complex derived
from the first neighbourhood of the diagonal of a manifold. This
cubical complex consists of infinitesimal parallelepipeda.

Yours
Anders

Couldn't one say that cylindric (and polyadic) algebras are awkward (from a
categorical point of view) formulations of posetal hyperdoctrines over
FinSet^op whose fibres are boolean algebras. So the pet objects of the
algebraic logicians are certain *presentations* of particular hyperdoctrines.
All this was worked out in a couple of papers by A. Daigneault beginning
of 70ies.
There is a lot of work by the algebraic logicians which I am not too familiar
with. There arises the question whether their work is of any use for questions
naturally arising to the categorical logician. That's how I understood Alex'
question and what I'd like to know myself.
Halmos was one of the first working on algebraic logic in the 50ies (polyadic
algebras) and was later positive w.r.t. categorical logic. That's what I have
heard of. Did he consider categorical logic as the "right formulation" of his
original aims? Maybe senior categorists do know about this?
