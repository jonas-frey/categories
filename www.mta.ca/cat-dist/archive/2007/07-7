Dear fellow-categorists,

On behalf of the international CT Advisory Committee, I am delighted
to announce that Maria Manuel Clementino has agreed to join the
Committee with immediate effect. The current membership of the
Committee, in alphabetical order, is thus as follows:

Maria Manuel Clementino <mmc@mat.uc.pt>
Peter Johnstone <ptj@dpmms.cam.ac.uk> (Secretary)
Bill Lawvere <wlawvere@buffalo.edu> (Chair)
Ross Street <street@math.mq.edu.au>
Walter Tholen <tholen@pascal.math.yorku.ca>
Myles Tierney <tierney@math.uqam.ca>
Richard Wood <rjwood@mathstat.dal.ca>

It might be appropriate at this point to remind people of the
Committee's function. It has no official status, and no executive
authority: its sole function is to offer advice, and the benefit
of our collective experience, to those who may
be thinking of organizing international conferences in Category
Theory, with the aim of ensuring that such conferences should take
place on a reasonably regular basis. Anyone who might be thinking
of organizing such a meeting is welcome to contact any member of
the Committee -- but particularly the undersigned -- at any time.

Peter Johnstone

The following paper is available:

"The Euler characteristic of a category
as the sum of a divergent series"

The Euler characteristic of a cell complex is often thought of as the
alternating sum of the number of cells of each dimension.  When the
complex is infinite, the sum diverges.  Nevertheless, it can sometimes
be evaluated; in particular, this is possible when the complex is the
nerve of a finite category.  This provides an alternative definition of
the Euler characteristic of a category, which is in many cases
equivalent to the original one.

Many thanks to Clemens Berger for suggesting the original idea.

Best wishes,
Tom

Postdoc in CREDO project

The position is within the IST-33826 research project CREDO "Modeling and
analysis of evolutionary structures for distributed services". The project
aims at the development and application of an integrated suite of tools
for compositional modeling, testing, and validation of software for
evolving networks of dynamically reconfigurable components.
More information
on this project can be found at http://www.cwi.nl/projects/credo.

The candidate is expected to work on a object-oriented software
development method and architecture to support the
dynamic composition of highly reconfigurable
component-based software systems. The method structures
applications as a network of adaptive concurrent computational tasks that
interact using mobile channels. The research focusses on studying:

(i) the effects of runtime reconfiguration of the network of mobile channels,
and
(ii) the effects runtime changes/upgrades of the computational tasks.


In addition, the applicability of light-weight and automated verification and
model checking techniques and tools will be evaluated in a real-world
case study.

The candidate should have a PhD degree and a background in software engineering,
concurrency and distributed systems, and practical software
development or formal methods.

The postdoc is offered a full-time position for the remaining
duration of the CREDO project (till September 2009).
To ensure intensive knowledge transfer from industry to university and
vice versa the position will be hosted by
the research group on coordination languages
of the Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science
(CWI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and
Almende BV which is one of the case study partners in the project.

To apply, please send your letter of application,
together with curriculum vitae, and possible letters of references to

Alfons Salden (alfons@almende.com) and Frank de Boer (F.S.de.Boer@cwi.nl).

In Toposes, Triples, and Theories, Barr and Wells define a morphism
of triples (which, being a student of Peter May, I will call a map of
monads) in the context of two monads on a given category C. I have a
situation where I have two categories C and D, a monad S on C, a
monad T on D, and a functor F: C -> D. There is a fairly obvious
generalization of the TTT definition, to say that a map from S to T
is a natural transformation FS -> TF making certain diagrams commute.
My guess is that someone else noticed this long ago, so I'm looking
for references to where this has appeared in the literature. I'm
particularly interested in references that include the fact (at
least, I'm pretty sure it's a fact) that such maps are in one-to-one
correspondence with extensions of F to a functor between the
respective Kleisli categories of S and T.

Thanks in advance.

See Ross Street "The formal theory of monads", JPAA 2 (1972) 149-168
for the general definition, in the abstract setting of a 2-category
instead of Cat.

Actually, there are two obvious generalizations of the TTT definition
("monad functors" and "monad opfunctors"), for the two possible
directions of F.

I think that somewhere Harry Appelgate did something like that, probably
in his Ph.D. thesis.  Whether he ever published it, I cannot now say.

	The category meeting in Carvoeiro, Portugal held from
June 17th to 23rd, 2007 proved to be one of the most enjoyable
and scientifically promising of the series. This was possible
because of the thoughtful and dedicated organization by
Diana Rodelo, Manuela Sobral, Maria Manuel Clementino, Jorge Picado,
Lourdes Sousa, Gonzalo Gutierres, and Maria Joao Ferreira.
They created a wonderful atmosphere which made possible the
collaboration and friendship between the senior researchers
who were there and the many very intelligent and active young
people, who will be contributing their original research to
future meetings.

	Of course, I was particularly honored by the fact that
the conference banquet took note of my 70th birthday and was
attended by several of my cherished students and colleagues.
I was gratified to meet the many young researchers whom I had not
previously known; they gave me the special gift of hope for the
future of our science.

	My friends and colleagues join me in heartily thanking the
organizers, the scientific committee, and the sponsoring
organizations for having created a most memorable occasion.

	Bill Lawvere

Algebra 175 (1-3) (2002) 243-265; MR2003m:18007 (preprint available from
the homepages of the authors).


Street's work is about 2-categories of monads and many people needed the
simply categorical level, because of the Linear Logic connection. So
there are several printed versions of the restricted result, including
one of our group, I believe, in

Relating Categorical Semantics for Intuitionistic Linear Logic,  (M.
Maietti, P. Maneggia, V. de Paiva and E. Ritter) in Applied Categorical
Structures, volume 13(1):1--36, 2005.=20

But given our application we prove it for comonads, lifting both to
Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras and to co-Kleisli categories.

See Ross Street "The formal theory of monads", JPAA 2 (1972) 149-168 for
the general definition, in the abstract setting of a 2-category instead
of Cat.

Actually, there are two obvious generalizations of the TTT definition
("monad functors" and "monad opfunctors"), for the two possible
directions of F.

Thanks, all, for the many replies (private as well as to the list).
Among other interesting references, almost everyone suggested Ross
Street's "The formal theory of monads" as well as the recent followup
by Street and Steve Lack, "The formal theory of monads II." I'll add
those to my summer reading list.

I think it's more likely to refer to John's unpublished (indeed,
unwritten) paper "Some concrete dualities". This appeared as an
abstract in the AMS Notices in 1974 (vol. 21, pp. A567-8), and I heard
John talk about it at an Oberwolfach meeting in 1975. In 1981 I asked
John when we could expect to see the paper in print (since I was then
writing "Stone Spaces", in which I wanted to refer to it), and he replied
that he was still working on the write-up of his 1973 Oberwolfach talk.
(The implication was that he'd get around to the 1975 talk when the
earlier one was out of the way, but I'm pretty sure he never did.)

Dear categorists (and anyone else reading),

I have a question that's been bugging me for some time (in genesis,
all the way back to 2002 I think). It concerns a certain construction
of interest in the world of (Banach) algebras: given an algebra over a
field one can equip its double dual with two natural algebra
structures, in general distinct, which extend the original algebra
structure. More generally any bilinear map from a pair of vector
spaces to a third vector space admits two natural extensions to a
bilinear map on the bidual spaces.

Functional analysts know this through work of Arens, but reading
through his original paper (Monatsh Math 1955) it becomes clear that
most of the calculations
work in any symmetric closed monoidal category and so I wondered if
this kind of construction has been well-studied or is
well-known/well-understood in the categorical community.
(Arens comes close to this level of abstraction but requires his
objects to be sets with structure.)

Here are the details (parphrased by me into the SCMC setting), with
apologies for the dodgy attempts at notation.

We work in a fixed symmetric closed monoidal category V. Fix a
distinguished object C in V (we are thinking of V as complex Banach
spaces and C as the ground field). Denote the `tensor' in V by @, and
isomorphism in V by ~ .

For A in ob(V) define A' using the Hom-tensor adjunction in V, i.e.

 Hom_V ( __ @ A, C) ~ Hom_V( __, A').

As usual we have a natural transformation with components A --> A'',
call this K.


Given objects R, S, T in V let's write r(R,S,T) for the isomorphism

R @ S @ T ~> S @ T @ R


Now: given an arrow m: E@F --> G  in V, we compose with the natural
map K_G to get E@ F --> G'', then use the Hom-tensor adjunction to get
an arrow E@F@G' --> C. Composing with the isomorphism r(G',E,F) gives
us an arrow

G' @ E @ F --> C

and using Hom-tensor adjunction again gives us, finally, an arrow

L(m) : G' @ E --> F'


Note that in the case V=vector spaces, E an algebra, and F=G a left
E-module with m the module action, L(m) is just the adjoint (right)
action of E on the dual of F.

Iterating this construction we get L^2(m): F'' @ G' --> E'  and

L^3(m): E'' @ F'' --> G''

which we might call the left Arens extension, or left Arens bidual, of m.

The right Arens extension is constructed similarly: as before we
produce from the original arrow m: E @ F --> G an arrow E @ F @ G' -->
C. This time we compose with the isomorphism r(E,F,G')^{-1} to get an
arrow

F@ G' @ E --> C

and apply Hom-tensor adjunction to get

R(m): F @ G' --> E'

Iterating this construction gives R^2(m): G' @ E'' --> F' and

R^3(m): E'' @ F'' --> G''

which we call the right Arens extension, or right Arens bidual, of m.

Then left and right Arens extensions have been studied by functional
analysts, mainly in the particular case where E=F=G is a Banach
algebra and m is the multiplication map; in this case both L^3(m) and
R^3(m) define associative multiplication maps on the double dual A'',
but in general these multiplication maps are not the same. (They
coincide if A is a C^*-algebra, and it would be interesting if there
was a categorical interpretation of the proof.)

Two noticeable features of the work functional analysts have done on
this area (in the case where V=Ban is Banach spaces and continuous
linear maps) is that

1) the notation used to prove things is horrible, and usually looks a
little like a proof by commutative diagrams would if it were written
out as a line-by-line equational argument;

2) a lot of the proofs use analytic tools (Hahn-Banach theorem, weak
compactness of various mappings) but look as if they should have
`purely algebraic proofs', i.e. the desired equations can often be
derived purely from the closed structure on Ban.

So if anyone can point me to any existing categorical/logical
literature in this vein I'd be very grateful! In particular I would
like to know why there are two equally `canonical' extensions, and
whether there are universal properties underlying them. Also: in view
of point 1) above, is there a better kind of graphical calculus for
doing calculations?

Best wishes
Yemon

In reply to Yemon Choi:

The situation you describe has been studied in the context of
symmetric monoidal closed categories, in some articles by me in the
early 1970s (references below). The main point about double
dualization in Banach spaces is that it is part of a V-enriched
("strong") monad on V (for suitable  symmetric monoidal closed
category V); and the two "Arens extensions" are special cases of the
two canonical monoidal structures which any V-enriched monad on V
admits. Commutative monads are those where the two structures agree.

[1] Monads on symmetric monoidal closed categories, Archiv der Math.
21 (1970), 1-10.
[2] On double dualization monads, Math. Scand 27 (1970), 151-165.

[5] Closed categories generated by commutative monads, J. Austral.
Math. Soc. 12 (1971), 405-424.

The V-enrichment ("strength") of an endofunctor T on V can be encoded
without reference to the closed structure of V as a transformation
T(A)@B-->T(A@B) ("tensorial strength", introduced in [4]).

Strong monads applied in functional-analytic contexts are also considered in my

Dear all,

Anders Kock's reply to Yemon Choi gives me a good opportunity to pose a
question which I have been meaning to ask the list for a while:

> The V-enrichment ("strength") of an endofunctor T on V can be encoded
> without reference to the closed structure of V as a transformation
> T(A)@B-->T(A@B) ("tensorial strength", introduced in [4]).

This notion of "tensorial strength" is just a special case of what
I would call "an action of a monoidal functor on a (mere) functor".
Specifically, it is a right-action of the identity monoidal functor
on the functor T.

In general, given a monoidal functor M:V-->W and a functor T:V-->W, a
right-action of M on T should be a n.t. of the form T(A)@M(B)-->T(A@B)
satisfying the obvious associativity and unitality axioms.

For instance, if we regard a G-graded algebra as a monoidal functor G-->Vec,
then a right-action of this on a mere functor G-->Vec is precisely the same
thing as a G-graded right-module.  [Here the monoid G (G can also stand for
grading-object!) is considered as a discrete monoidal category.]

I have always assumed that this concept is well-known, but I haven't
succeeded in finding a reference in the literature for it... perhaps
some of the more well-read readers of this list could help me out?

Cheers,
Jeff.

P.S. Upon reviewing [4], I see that there is a more general notion of
tensorial strength which can be applied to a functor A-->B whenever A
and B are tensored over some monoidal category V.  There is a similar
adaptation of the notion of action of a monoidal functor V-->W to
functors A-->B whenever A is tensored over (or I would say, acted on by)
V, and B over (by) W.

In reply to Jeff Egger:

Actions by monoidal categories were considered by Benabou in 1967
("Intoduction to bicategories", Midwest Category Seminar I); strength
of functors between categories on which a monoidal category acts were
considered by H. Lindner, in some papers/preprints in the late 70s,
and a summary is given in his "Enriched categories and enriched
modules", Cahiers Vol 22 (1981), 161-174. This paper also contains
several references.

-Aspects of tensorial strength has been developed by several
computer-science mathematicians later (starting with E. Moggi, I
believe); I do not know much about their work, so my answer to Jeff's
question may not be up to date.

(I wrote this to Jeff and Anders a few minutes ago. Since Anders has replied
to all I am circulating it more widely.)

Dear Jeff and Anders
In my thesis (supervised by Bob Pare at Dalhousie in 1976) I considered
(for reasons I won't labour here) (V^op,set)-categories, for monoidal V.
The monoidal structure I took on (V^op,set) was Brian Day's convolution.
Necessarily, a (V^op,set)-category A gives rise to a functor
P:A^op x V^op x A ---> set and this reveals that there are three special
kinds of (V^op,set)-categories:

1) those for which P(-,v,b) is representable, for all v and b, by {v,b} say

2) those for which P(a,-,b) is representable, for all a and b, by [a,b] say

3) those for which P(a,v,-) is representable, for all a and v, by v@a say.

Ordinary V-categories are given by 2). The others have been known
by various names but they are best understood in terms of actions.

Now suppose that F:A--->B is a (V^op,set)-functor where A is of type i)
and B is of type j) as above. Each of the nine possibilities admits a
simple encoding of the enrichment as displayed in the following table:

i)\j)	      1)		      2)		      3)
  1)	F{v,b}--->{v,Fb}	v--->[F{v,b},Fb]	v@F{v,b}--->Fb
  2)	Fa--->{[a,b],Fb}	[a,b]--->[Fa,Fb]	[a,b]@Fa--->Fb
  3)	Fa--->{v,F(v@a)}	v--->[Fa,F(v@a)]	v@Fa--->F(v@a)

Susan Niefield, Robin Cockett, and I are writing a paper whose sequel
will deal with later developments of this topic.
Best to all, Richard

Dear Jeff

"Monoid" and "object on which a monoid acts" make sense in any
multicategory. A monoidal functor is a monoid in the convolution
multicategory [V,W] of functors from V to W. The T of which you speak
is an object on which M acts in [V,W].

Regards,
Ross

Fellow Category Theorists,

The website for PSSL86 is now open, including a list of suggested
hotels and the registration page, in two languages.

http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/psslHomeEN.html
http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/psslHomeFR.html

We are asking you to use the registration page to inform us of your
intention to attend. The process is quite informal, but we need to
keep track of how many people are coming, in order to prepare for the
catering. There are no registration fees, but those who want to attend
the Saturday banquet will be asked for a moderate sum.

See you soon in Nancy,

Fran=E7ois Lamarche

PSSL86 IN NANCY

The 86th edition of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will
be held at the Institut =C9lie Cartan (IECN) on the Universit=E9 Henri
Poincar=E9 campus in Nancy, France, on the weekend of September 8-9
2007. We intend to continue the PSSL tradition of informality, and to
schedule talks pertaining to any aspect of category theory, with or
without applications in natural science, logic, computer science, or
other branches of mathematics.

The schedule will be announced shortly before the event.

Dear category theorists,

Suppose we have chosen left and right adjoints for F:A->B and G:A->B

   F-| F* -| F     and     G-| G*-|G

  i_F: 1_B =3D> FF*       i_G: 1_B =3D> GG*
  e_F: F*F =3D> 1_A       e_G: G*G =3D> 1_A
  j_F: 1_A =3D> F*F       j_G: 1_A =3D> G*G
  k_F: FF* =3D> 1_B       k_G: GG* =3D> 1_B

Then given any 2-morphism a:F=3D>G there are two obvious duals (mates =20
under adjunction) for the 2-morphsism a

   a+ :G*=3D>F* :=3D    (e_G F*).(G*aF*).(G* i_F)
   +a :G*=3D>F* :=3D    (F* k_G).(F*aG*).(j_F G*)

or for those who like pictures:
     +a                    a+
    __                       __
   /  \     |        |     /   \
  |    |    |        |    |     |
  |    a    |        |    a     |
  |    |    |        |    |     |
  |     \__/          \__/      |
  |                             |

In general a+ is not equal to +a because if is was we could always twist one
of the units and counits so that it does not hold. Has the condition =20
that a+ =3D +a been investigated in the literature anywhere?  In =20
particular, if a 2-category is such that all 1-morphisms F have a =20
simultaneous left and right adjoint then has anyone studied the =20
context where the adjoints are such that  a+ =3D +a  is always =20
satisfied? Perhaps, this notion has been studied in the language of =20
duals for 1-morphisms?

The above condition appears to be related to the notion of pivotal =20
category when we look at Hom(A,A) for any object A.

Thanks,
Aaron Lauda

Coordination Models, Languages and Applications

Special Track of the 23rd ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC08)
March 16 - 20, 2008, Fortaleza, Brazil

http://ii.hevs.ch/sac2008

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT DATES

* Submission deadline: 7 September 2007
* Author notification: 15 October 2007
* Camera ready: 30 October 2007

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

AIMS & SCOPE

Building on the success of the nine previous editions (1998-2007), a special
track on coordination models, languages and applications will be held at SAC
2008. Over the last decade, we have witnessed the emergence of models,
formalisms and mechanisms to describe concurrent and distributed
computations and systems based on the concept of coordination.  The purpose
of a coordination model is to enable the integration of a number of,
possibly heterogeneous, components (processes, objects, agents) in such a
way that the resulting ensemble can execute as a whole, forming a software
system with desired characteristics and functionalities which possibly takes
advantage of parallel and distributed systems. The coordination paradigm is
closely related to other contemporary software engineering approaches such
as multi-agent systems, service-oriented architectures, component-based
systems and related middleware platforms. Furthermore, the concept of
coordination exists in many other Computer Science areas such as workflow
systems, cooperative information systems, distributed artificial
intelligence, and internet technologies.

After more than a decade of research, the coordination paradigm is gaining
increased momentum in state-of-the-art engineering paradigms such as
multi-agent systems and service-oriented architectures: in the first case,
coordination abstractions are perceived as essential to design and support
the working activities of agent societies; in the latter case, service
coordination, orchestration, and choreography are going to be essential
aspects of the next generations of systems based on Web services.

The Special Track on Coordination Models, Languages and Applications takes a
deliberately a broad view of what constitutes coordination. Accordingly,
major topics of interest this year will include:

- Novel models, languages, programming and implementation techniques
- Applications of coordination technologies
- Industrial points of view: experiences, applications, open issues
- Internet- and Web-based coordinated systems
- Coordination of multi-agent systems, including mobile agents, intelligent
agents, and agent-based simulations
- Coordination in Service-oriented architectures and Web Services
- Languages for service description and composition
- Models, frameworks and tools for Group Decision Making
- Modern Workflow Management Systems and Case-Handling
- Coordination in Computer Supported Cooperative Work
- Software architectures and software engineering techniques
- Configuration and Architecture Description Languages
- Coordination Middleware and Infrastructures
- Coordination in GRID systems
- Emergent Coordination: Swam based, Stigmergy
- Coordination technologies, systems and infrastructures
- Relationship with other computational models such as object oriented,
declarative (functional, logic, constraint), programming or their extensions
with coordination capabilities
- Formal aspects (semantics, reasoning, verification)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEEDINGS AND POST-PROCEEDINGS

Papers accepted for the Special Track on Coordination Models, Languages and
Applications will be published by ACM both in the SAC 2008 proceedings and
in the Digital Library.

I have the following question about finite objects in toposes with nno
where with ``finite'' I mean K-finite and with decidable equality.

It is well known that in every topos EE with nno N there exists a family
k : K -> N of finite sets such that for every family a : A -> I of finite sets
there exists an epi e : I ->> J and a map f : J -> N such that e^*a \cong f^*k.
Such a map k one may call a ``weakly generic family of finite sets''.
I would like to know whether there always exists a family  \pi : E -> U  of
finite sets which is "generic" in the sense that for every family a : A -> I
of finite sets there exists an  f : I -> U  with  f^*k' \cong a.

Already for Psh(G) with G a nontrivial finite group one cannot take the usual
weakly generic map  k = \succ \circ \add : N x N -> N  because the
representable object G = y(*) is finite but not isomorphic to n^*k for some
n : 1 -> N.
However, for arbitrary small cats C such a map \pi : E -> U  exist: take
for U(I) the set of presheaves on C/I valued in FinSet_iso and where u operates
by precomposing with (C/u)^\op. E(I) consists of pairs (F,x) where F is in U(I)
and x \in F(\id_I). (This is a variation of a construction in my paper
"Universes in Toposes" pp.9-10 albeit with FinSet instead of a Groth.universe).

However, it is not clear to me for the case of sheaf toposes. In realizability
toposes I think the usual k = \succ \circ \add : N x N -> N does work.

Anyway, I would like to know if anyone has considered the problem and whether
there is a "logical" (i.e. in the internal language) construction of a generic
family family \pi : E -> U for every topos with nno.

Dear Steve,

A bicomma object is a bicategorical limit, so determined only
up to equivalence. A comma object is a strict limit, so determined
up to isomorphism.=20

In the case of Cat, comma objects are just the usual comma categories
(strictly speaking, anything isomorphic to the comma category), while
anything equivalent to the comma category will be a bicomma object.

So any comma object is also a bicomma object, but the converse is false.
Moreover, there are 2-categories in which bicomma objects exist but
comma objects do not.

The situation with pullbacks, by the way, is slightly different. It is
not the case that every pullback is a bipullback (but there is a paper=20
of Joyal and Street giving a sufficient condition for a pullback to be
a bipullback).

Steve.

I'd be curious to know what if any replies you received.

As you already hinted, the special case of a monoidal category
with this property has been studied: it's called "pivotal".
Strict pivotal categories were studied here:

P.J. Freyd and D.N. Yetter, Braided compact closed categories
with applications to low dimensional topology, Adv. Math. 77 (1989),
156--182

and there's more discussion here:

John W. Barrett and Bruce W. Westbury, Spherical Categories,
Adv. Math. 143 (1999) 357-375.
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9310164

I don't know who has studied more general (strict or weak) 2-categories
with this pivotal property, though it's a natural generalization.
Street should have bumped into it in his work on 2-categorical
string diagrams.

I've written about "2-categories with duals" in my work on the Tangle
Hypothesis.  These are pivotal, but they also have more structure,
which you may not want.  (You may want it if you're studying things
like tangles!)

Perhaps it would be good to pose a specific question.  What would
you like to know about pivotal 2-categories?  Or are you mainly
just looking for references?

Best,
jb

The FoIKS symposia provide a biennial forum for presenting and
discussing theoretical and applied research on information and knowledge
systems. The goal is to bring together researchers with an interest in
this subject, share research experiences, promote collaboration and
identify new issues and directions for future research.

FoIKS 2008 solicits original contributions dealing with any foundational
aspect of information and knowledge systems, including submissions from
researchers working in fields such as discrete mathematics, logic and
algebra, model theory, information theory, complexity theory,
algorithmics and computation, statistics and optimisation who are
interested in applying their ideas, theories and methods to research on
information and knowledge systems.

Previous FoIKS symposia were held in Budapest (Hungary) in 2006, Vienna
(Austria) in 2004, Schloss Salzau near Kiel (Germany) in 2002, and
Burg/Spreewald near Berlin (Germany) in 2000. FoIKS took up the
tradition of the conference series Mathematical Fundamentals of Database
Systems (MFDBS), which initiated East-West collaboration in the field of
database theory. Former MFDBS conferences were held in Rostock (Germany)
in 1991, Visegrad (Hungary) in 1989, and Dresden (Germany) in 1987.

The FoIKS symposia are a forum for intensive discussions. Speakers are
given sufficient time to present their results, expound relevant
background information and put their research into context. Furthermore,
participants are asked in advance to prepare as correspondents to a
contribution of another author.

Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:

     * Database Design: formal models, dependency theory, schema
       translations, desirable properties;
     * Dynamics of Information and Knowledge Systems: models of
       transactions, models of interaction, updates, consistency
       preservation, concurrency control;
     * Information Integration: heterogeneous data, views, schema
       dominance and equivalence;
     * Integrity and Constraint Management: verification, validation, and
       enforcement of consistency, triggers;
     * Intelligent Agents: multi-agent systems, autonomous agents,
       foundations of software agents, cooperative agents;
     * Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval: machine learning,
       data mining, text mining, information extraction;
     * Knowledge Representation: planning, reasoning techniques,
       description logics, knowledge and belief, belief revision and
       update, non-monotonic formalisms, uncertainty;
     * Logics in Databases and AI: non-classical logics, spatial and
       temporal logics, probabilistic logics, deontic logic, logic
       programming;
     * Mathematical Foundations: discrete structures and algorithms,
       graphs, grammars, automata, abstract machines, finite model
       theory, information theory;
     * Security and Risk Management in Information and Knowledge Systems:
       privacy, trust, cryptography, steganography, information hiding;
     * Semi-Structured Data and XML: data modelling, data processing,
       data compression, data exchange;
     * Social and Collaborative Computing: symbiotic intelligence,
       self-organisation, knowledge flow, decision making;
     * The Semantic Web and Knowledge Management: languages, ontologies,
       agents, adaption, intelligent algorithms; and
     * The WWW: models of Web databases, Web dynamics, Web services, Web
       transactions and negotiations.

I would like to thank all those that I replied so far.

Quoting John Baez <baez@math.ucr.edu>:

To answer John, I would like to know what condition is required on =20
left and right adjoints in a 2-category K to ensure that a string =20
diagram representing a 2-morphism in K is invariant under topological =20
deformation restricting to the identity on the boundary.  I prefer not =20
to use monoidal 2-categories, just ordinary 2-categories/bicategories.

If I take a monoidal bicategory with duals and forget the monoidal =20
structure will this be what I am after?  2-tangles clearly have the =20
property I am looking for, but what if we adjoin some new 2-morphism A =20
to 2-tangles.  What condition would I need in order to ensure that any =20
string diagram with the new morphism A was invariant under topological =20
deformation?

> I'd be curious to know what if any replies you received.

Aside from the replies that have been posted, I have also received a =20
pointer to the paper "Introduction to linear bicategories" by Cockett, =20
Koslowski, and Seely.  The condition that *a=3Da* is studied in the =20
context of linear bicategories and what are called cyclic adjoints.  =20
In particular, the discussion of cyclic mates seems to especially =20
relevant.  But I have not finished reading the paper and am still =20
trying to understand what implications the `linear' in linear =20
bicatgories will have on the ordinary bicategory case.

Aaron

A very satisfying answer to my recent question on this list has been given to
me by Andreas Blass. Since \Delta : Set -> Psh(G) is logical there is no way
of defining a generic family of finite objects in the language of higher order
arithmetic since every such family would be of the form \Delta(u). That such a
family can't be generic is shown already by the argument in my mail.
Moreover, as he pointed out and I also observed, although A -> I is a family
of finite sets iff \forall i:I.\exists! n:N. A_i \cong K_n there will in general
be no external choice function providing such an n:N for i:I although
internally by AUC there exists a unique such choice function.
After all this is no suprise since the representable object of Psh(G) has
global support but no global element (unless G is trivial).

Andreas Blass has pointed out to me that that there was a mistake in my recent
mail. There does exist a global element n : 1 -> N such that G \cong K_n
(n is the order of the group G) BUT the statement G \cong K_n contains a hidden
existential quantifier over Iso(G,K_n) and this latter one is not witnessed by
a global section of Iso(G,K_n).

Dear List Members,

I am looking for a formal definition of parsimony for fundamental
scientific theories.  From the tiny bit I understood of category
theory, I had the impression it might provide the right framework for
such a definition.

The problem of motivating and defining parsimony is being discussed in
analytic philosophy.  An overview over the discussion can be found at
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ , which starts off with
the sentences

  Most philosophers believe that, other things being equal, simpler
  theories are better. But what exactly does theoretical simplicity
  amount to? Syntactic simplicity, or elegance, measures the number
  and conciseness of the theories basic principles. Ontological
  simplicity, or parsimony, measures the number of kinds of entities
  postulated by the theory. One issue concerns how these two forms of
  simplicity relate to one another.

I am interested in the "ontological simplicity, or
parsimony". However, if one understands modern physics as describing
essentially only one thing, the wave-function of the universe, then
even the idea of defining parsimony in terms of numbers of kinds of
things seems to be a bit odd.

Yet, I think the idea is intuitively clear.  The minimum requirement
for a formal definition of parsimony is perhaps that it should
identify theories such as the dynamics of Newtonian point-particles or
the current "standard model" of particle physics as parsimonious, while
the same theories with some oddities added, which do not themselves
affect the "real" physics, should be identifiable as non-parsimonious.

Beyond this, such a definition should presuppose as little as possible
about the nature of the theories it applies to.

Does somebody know about applications of category theory to this
problem, or have an idea for who to do it?

Cheers,

Axel Rossberg

Without going into its relevance to category theory, I would put the SEP
article on parsimony that Axel Rossberg pointed to alongside the
Wikipedia article on spice (the vegetative substance described at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice, not the rock group).

On the one hand spices, as the latter article points out, "have been
prominent in human history virtually since their inception.  Spices were
among the most valuable items of trade in the ancient and medieval world."

On the other hand what restaurant serves only spices on its menu?
Cuisine is a complex art for which spices are merely a valuable adjunct
that can make a big difference in a catalytic kind of way.

Parsimony is the catalytic converter of mathematics.  It is not the main
engine, but can be helpful in cleaning up the noxious byproducts of
inefficient thinking.

Too much however can be a bad thing: overdoing parsimony undermines its
efficacy for mathematics while adding to the cost, just as overdoing
spices does for food and platinum for catalytic converters.

Rossberg's suggestion that modern physics describes only the wave
function of the universe illustrates this nicely.  If this were really
true, physics would not be a degree major, let alone a career option,
but merely a module of a course in some other major.

In any event it is contradicted by the standard model Rossberg refers to
in the next paragraph.  Explaining the standard model by a suitably
parsimonious Theory of Everything is a nice thought, like an antigravity
belt when you're stuck in traffic, but the standard model is a complex
and evolving account of how the huge zoo of particles fits together.
"Parsimony" in any account of the standard model today is only
accomplished by leaving things out.  The Particle Physics Booklet
(formerly the Particle Properties Data Booklet) is some 200 pages of
densely packed information about uncountably many particles parametrized
by nearly a score of fundamental physical constants each determined by
careful measurement.  (The number of particles is uncountable because
many are merely conjectured to exist, although billions of dollars are
being spent today in the expectation of confirming at least some of
those conjectures.  If only the Riemann Hypothesis were so
well-endowed!)  Some idea of the parsimony achieved by the PPB can be
had from its expansion as the Review of Particle Physics, the PPB's
1100-page big brother.

Ironically the parsimony article is considerably less parsimonious than
the spice article.

As a talisman against the off-topic rule, I should relay here an
unverified report from the fourth millennium to the effect that
"categories were prominent in human mathematics virtually since their
inception, and were among the most heavily trafficked items of
metamathematical discourse during the third millennium."  They're a good
investment, I have some in my own kitchen but many on this list who take
their cooking more seriously have invested much more heavily.

(Out of fairness to *the* standard model, the Higgs boson is its only
remaining unobserved particle.  The other particles being sought at
Fermilab and CERN belong to supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of the
standard model.  Ironically such an extension while having more
particles could nevertheless claim to be more parsimonious than the
current standard model as measured by the number of its free parameters,
in particular fewer Yukawa constants.  Disclaimer: if you knew SUSY like
I know SUSY no physics lab would even think of hiring you.)
