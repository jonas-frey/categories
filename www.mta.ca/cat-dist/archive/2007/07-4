Hi All,


I am wondering if anyone knows the page numbers of the following paper by
Alexandroff and Urysohn:

M\'{e}moire sur les espaces topologiques compacts, Vehr. Akad. Wetensch.
Amsterdam 14 (1929)

I found this reference on page 470 of Engelking's "General Topology"
(second edition). I am wondering if it is a typo, or maybe this is a
monograph on its own?  I was tryign to look up information on Vehr. Akad.
Wetensch. Amsterdam, but I found very little about it.

Many thanks,

Gabi

ICTAC is an International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of
Computing founded by the International Institute for Software
Technology of the United Nations University (UNU-IIST). The aim of the
colloquium is to bring together practitioners and researchers from
academia, industry and government to present research results, and
exchange experience, ideas, and solutions for their problems in
theoretical aspects of computing. Beyond these scholarly goals,
another main purpose of the conference is to promote cooperation in
research and education between participants and their institutions,
from developing and industrial countries, as in the mandate of the
United Nations University. The previous three ICTAC events were held
in Guiyang, China (2004), Hanoi, Vietnam (2005), Tunis, Tunisia
(2006).

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:
  - automata theory and formal languages
  - principles and semantics of programming languages
  - logics and their applications
  - software architectures and their description languages
  - software specification, refinement, and verification
  - model checking and theorem proving
  - formal techniques in software testing
  - models of object and component systems
  - coordination and feature interaction
  - integration of formal and engineering methods
  - service-oriented development
  - models of concurrency, security, and mobility
  - theory of parallel, distributed, and internet-based (grid) computing
  - real-time, embedded and hybrid systems
  - type and category theory in computer science
  - case studies
  - theories, tools and experiments of verified systems
  - integration of theories of system development and their tool support

ICTAC 2007 will have a technical program for five days including a
two-day festschrift symposium dedicated to the 70th birthdays of
former UNU-IIST directors, Dines Bj=F8rner and Zhou Chaochen, and three
days for a conference. There will also be a training school in the
preceding week on topics of Domain Modelling and the Duration
Calculus, to which Dines Bj=F8rner and Zhou Chaochen have made
significant contribution.

Paper Submissions:

Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be
concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions
will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field,
technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the
conference. Papers should be written in English and not exceed 15
pages in LNCS format (see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html for details).

Proceedings of the previous editions of ICTAC were published by
Springer in the LNCS series. We plan to do the same this year. Best
papers will be selected from the accepted papers and their authors
invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue
of Formal Aspects of Computing.

Submission Procedure:

Further information and instruction about submission can be found at
the conference website http://www.iist.unu.edu/ictac07.

Gabor,

I presume you have already found out that it is not in Mathscinet.
But it is in ZMath (the European counter-part of Mathscinet):

http://zb.msri.org/cgi-bin/zmen/ZMATH/en/quick.html?first=1&maxdocs=20&type=html&an=55.0960.02&format=complete

(It finds 7 joint papers of these two authors.)

The missing details to your reference are:

    Verhandelingen Amsterdam 14, Nr.~1, 93 S. (1929)

It seems to be a monograph. There is a long review of this written in
German.

Martin

I have been able to find some references to the co-algebraic structure
of the untyped lambda-calculus, (work of Honsell and Lenisa, available at
http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/95166.html
and
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=645892.671579&coll=&dl=ACM&CFID=15151515&CFTOKEN=6184618

), but my search for a typed analogue has not turned up anything (which
I could recognize as being what I was looking for).
I found work by various authors (P. Aczel, B. Jacobs, J. Rutten, etc)
which seemed 'close', but nothing seemed quite 'right'.
I rather suspect that this has already been done and I am simply not
using the right terms in my searches - could someone
please provide me with some references?

Thanks,
Jacques

Perhaps "representably fully faithful" is a good name.

In Cat, they are the fully faithful functors.

In V-Cat they may not be fully faithful V-functors: see

(with R.F.C. Walters) Yoneda structures on 2-categories, J. Algebra
50 (1978) 350-379

Also see

Polymath revelled in the mystery of numbers

Date: April 11 2007


Max Kelly, 1930-2007

IT IS easy to be famous in Australia if you are a sportsperson or an
actor; it's harder for a professor of mathematics who introduced a
concept most people have never heard of, even if that concept is
extremely useful in everyday life.
Professor Emeritus Max Kelly was solely responsible for introducing
into Australia a branch of mathematics known as category theory,
which pervades almost all research in the fundamental structures of
mathematics, allowing people in one branch of maths to understand
others in a common form, not unlike Esperanto in languages. It is
used in theoretical physics, computer architecture, software design,
and banking and finance to connect ideas and streamline the
management of information.
In 1966 Kelly and Samuel Eilenberg wrote the monograph Closed
Categories, which set the stage for two more generations of
Australian category theorists who flourish and are highly acclaimed
worldwide. Kelly's book Basic Concepts of Enriched Category Theory
(1982) is a standard in the field.
Gregory Maxwell Kelly, who has died at 76, showed his mathematical
ability early. In 1946, he topped the state in the Leaving
Certificate and took a Higher Exhibition in mathematics, after
studying at Marist Brothers at Bondi. He graduated from Sydney
University in 1950, with a science degree, first-class honours and
the University Medal for mathematics and the James King of Irrawang
travelling scholarship. He took his PhD at Cambridge in 1957.
Kelly was appointed a professor of pure mathematics at the University
of NSW in 1967 and a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science at
the age of 42. He returned to Sydney University in 1973 as a
professor, staying 21 years until his retirement in 1994.
He was a true academic: erudite in the classics, a prolific
researcher and publisher, editor for several journals, inspiring
lecturer, PhD supervisor, successful department head, traveller,
linguist, raconteur and bon vivant.
Some colleagues claim him as a logician in his passionate insistence
on precision and clarity in mathematics and his belief in, and search
for, the grand order at the heart of the world. Much of his work can
be called higher-order universal algebra.
Aware of how fortunate his life had been, he felt obliged to give
something back to the community. He happily gave time to aspiring
young mathematicians and to all those keen to learn.
Always aware of what was going on in the world, he was once
threatened with excommunication from the Catholic Church for
challenging the priest in Mass about the morality of the Vietnam War.
Another time, frustrated by bureaucracies, he enlisted the media to
borrow for a blind girl in a Catholic school a mathematics textbook
in braille that was gathering dust in a Department of Education
office. He was involved with Action for World Development and in ways
to help the Aboriginal community in Redfern.
In 1960 Kelly married Imogen Datson and they had four children, whom
Kelly impressed with his range of knowledge - astronomy, languages,
history, politics, theology and philosophy - as well as his ability
to rebuild the lawnmower's carburettor and his habit of stopping in
mid-conversation to admire his favourite flowering trees. Imogen took
her PhD, in medieval drama, as a mature-aged student in 2002.
Kelly used mathematics in ordinary life, too, devising an ingenious
way of encoding PINs on his credit cards that involved Greek symbols
encrypted with mathematical transformations. One such card had a
square matrix of dots and symbols drawn on the back. To most people
it would have looked like a smudge or a doodle, but to Kelly it was
as clear as four written numbers.
Kelly started learning ancient Greek recently and in his last months
he was engaged in complex research on coherence theory, which he was
typing despite failing eyesight. This research will be completed and
published by collaborators in Canada and Italy.
Max Kelly is survived by Imogen, their children, Dom, Martin,
Catherine and Simon, and 10 grandchildren.

	CNRS POSTDOCTORAL POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT

A one-year postdoctoral fellowship in mathematics and computer science
has been opened by the CNRS for the next academic year.

The purpose of the postdoc position is to work in our research team PPS
(Proofs, Programs, Systems) on a project at the interface between

-- proof theory (linear logic)
-- type theory (dependent types)
-- homotopy theory (model structures)
-- category theory (higher dimensional categories)

The more detailed research project appears below.

The postdoc position will take place at the Institut Mathematique de
Jussieu,
a very large and lively mathematical research institute situated in
Paris centre.

The deadline for submission is 10 MAY 2007.

Potential applicants should contact us as early as possible

Pierre-Louis Curien (curien at pps.jussieu.fr)
Paul-Andre Mellies (mellies at pps.jussieu.fr)

For more information about the PPS research group and the institute, see
http://www.pps.jussieu.fr

------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

Research project

Type theory plays a fundamental role in the definition of programming
languages
and proof systems. More specifically, dependent type theory
introduced by Martin-Lof
in the 1970s lies at the heart of many proof assistants, like the Coq
system developed
at INRIA.

Recently, a promising meeting point has emerged between dependent
type theory,
and homotopy theory -- a theory embracing all of algebraic topology.
The basic idea
is simple: the typing towers encountered in type theory, where a
program M has a type tau,
which itself has a class s... are of the same nature as the homotopy
towers, where
two paths f and g of dimension 1 are related by homotopy relations
alpha and beta
of dimension 2, themselves related by homotopy relations of dimension
3, etc.
However, this meeting point between type theory and homotopy theory
can only be reached
at the price of abstraction, using the higher dimensional category
theory.

We are convinced that this homotopic point of view leads eventually
to a better integration
of type theory (dependent types), proof theory (linear logic), and
rewriting theory (rewriting modulo).

Profile of the candidate

The candidate will have an expertise in at least one of the following
fields: proof theory,
type theory, rewriting theory, homotopy theory, higher dimensional
category theory.
He will also be curious to learn the other fields, and to work at
their interface.

Category theorists in general, and topos theorists in particular,
may want to check out this week's cover story in the New Scientist
(www.newscientist.com). The author (Robert Matthews of Aston
University in Birmingham) is clearly a fan of Chris Isham: it's not
clear to me whether he actually knows what a topos is, but he has
committed himself to statements such as

"Topos theory could lead to a view of reality more astonishing
and successful than quantum theory"

which is splashed all over page 32 of the magazine. Even if you don't
believe this (and I don't think I do) it's pleasant to see topos theory
getting this sort of publicity.

This is to announce two preprints, which take on our study of weak
double categories and deal with Kan extensions. The first two parts,
dealing with limits and adjoints, respectively, where published in
"Cahiers" (1999, 2004) and can also be found on my server.

Abstracts.

Part III. This paper deals with Kan extensions in a weak double
category. Absolute Kan extensions are closely related to the
orthogonal adjunctions introduced in a previous paper. The pointwise
case is treated by introducing internal comma objects, which can be
defined in an arbitrary double category.

Part IV. Right Kan extensions for weak double categories extend
double limits and other constructions, called vertical companions and
vertical adjoints, studied in previous papers. We prove that these
particular cases are sufficient to construct all pointwise unitary
lax right Kan extensions, along those lax double functors which
satisfy a Conduche type condition. Double categories 'based on
profunctors' are complete, i.e. have all such constructions, while
the double category of commutative squares on a complete category is
not, in general.

Dear colleagues,

I am happy to announce that a new Foundation called "Sciences
Mathematiques de Paris" has just been created:

www.sciencesmaths-paris.fr

It groups several major laboratories of Paris in the field of
mathematics, as well as the two computer science laboratories of
Paris 7 University (LIAFA, www.liafa.jussieu.fr, and PPS,
www.pps.jussieu.fr).  The foundation will launch a number of
programs. For this coming academic year (2007/2008), the following
programs may be relevant for computer scientists interested to spend
some time in Paris and wish to work in LIAFA or PPS:

- a postdoc program (deadline for application: May 4th)

- an invitation program for scientists for visits of 2 to 3 months
(deadline for application: May 18th)

Dear all,

The category of double categories DCat is monoidal, as shown by
Bastiani-Ehresmann (cahiers vol 15 no. 3). Has work has been done on
DCat-categories?
For example, if we have two distinct notions of 2-arrow between 1-
arrows, what 1-arrows can we call equivalent?

Yours,

It seems hard to find references to a categorical treatment of
C*-algebras. Concretely, there are several tensor products on
C*-algebras. Which one is `the right one' from a categorical perspective?

Thanks,

I'm not an expert but I don't think there is a `right one', it depends
on what you want to do with your C*-algebras. The maximal C*-norm has
better universal properties than the minimal one (it seems) but the
resulting C*-algebra is then somewhat hard to get at.

Actually, I'm not sure what significance the tensor product of
_algebras_ (as opposed to _modules_) has. Of course for commutative
unital algebras this is the coproduct, but commutative C*-algebras
have unique C*-tensor norms anyway.

The two I know are the "projective" and "injective" tensor products.

I think the projective (or "maximum possible norm") tensor product
of unital C*-algebras has the following universal property:

There are homomorphisms from A and B into the projective tensor
product A tensor B, and given homomorphisms f: A -> X,
g: B -> X whose ranges commute, there exists a unique homomorphism

f tensor g: A tensor B -> X

such that the two obvious triangles commute, namely one like this:

A ------> A tensor B
  \         |
   \        |
    \       |
    f\      |f tensor g
      \     |
       \    |
        v   v
          X

and a similar one for B.

Here I'm using the unital nature of the C*-algebras in question
to get the homomorphisms from A and B into A tensor B; you have
to do something different for nonunital C*-algebras.

Best,
