SPECIAL ISSUE ON HYBRID LOGIC
  Journal of Logic, Language and Information
  Call for papers
  http://akira.ruc.dk/~torben/HyLo1.TXT
* Scope. Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic allowing direct
  reference to worlds/times/states. It is easy to justify interest
  in hybrid logic on applied grounds, because of the usefulness of
  the additional expressive power. In addition, hybrid-logical
  machinery improves the behaviour of the underlying modal formalism.
  For example, it becomes far simpler to formulate modal tableau,
  resolution, and natural deduction in hybrid logic, and
  completeness and interpolation results can be proved of a
  generality that is not available in orthodox modal logic.
  Topics of interest include not only standard hybrid-logical
  machinery like nominals, satisfaction operators, and the downarrow
  binder, but generally extensions of modal logic that increase
  its expressive power.
* Submission deadlines: March 1, 2008.
* Guest editors: Torben Bra=C3=BCner and Thomas Bolander
* For further information see the URL above.


JOURNAL OF LOGIC, LANGUAGE AND INFORMATION (JOLLI)
  SPECIAL ISSUE ON VISUAL LANGUAGES AND LOGIC
  Guest Editors: Philip Cox, Dalhousie University;
  Andrew Fish and John Howse, University of Brighton.
  CALL FOR PAPERS
* Diagrams of one sort or another have always been used as aids to
  abstract reasoning. Although many are informal mnemonics, reminding
  their authors about structures and relationships they have observed
  or deduced, considerable research effort has been expended on
  formalising graphical notations so that they may play a more central
  role in the application of logic to problems. While early work
  concentrated on diagrammatic representations of logic as a more
  intuitive or revealing paper-based replacement for textually
  represented logic, research in this area now mostly involves notations
  specifically designed for computer implementation either as
  computational models or interface languages. Examples include
  relational and existential graphs (C.S. Peirce), conceptual graphs
  (J.F. Sowa), various flavours of semantic networks such as conceptual
  dependency graphs (R. Schank), graphical deduction systems such as
  clause interconnectivity graphs (S. Sickel), Venn diagrams, Euler
  diagrams, constraint diagrams, and visual logic programming languages.
* Following the success of the 2007 Workshop on Visual Languages and
  Logic (VLL 2007) (http://vivid.cs.dal.ca/VLL), we are soliciting,
  for a Special Issue of JOLLI, papers in which the primary focus is
  research at the intersection of logic and visual languages.
  In particular, we invite VLL 2007 authors to submit updated and
  expanded versions of their papers.
* Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Graphical
  notations for logics (either classical or non-classical, such as
  first or higher order logic, temporal logic, description logic,
  independence friendly logic, spatial logic); Diagrammatic reasoning;
  Theorem proving; Formalisation (syntax, semantics, reasoning rules);
  Expressiveness of visual logics; Visual logic programming languages;
  Visual specification languages;
  Applications; Tool support for visual logics.
* If you intend to submit a paper, please email a title, abstract and
  keywords to VLL@cs.dal.ca by November 30, 2007. This information
  will be used to assign referees in advance of the paper
  deadline. Your paper may be up to 30 pages, must conform to
  the JOLLI style (see following URL), and be emailed as a PDF to
  VLL@cs.dal.ca by January 31, 2008. Note that although PDF is not the
  required format for the final copies of accepted papers, it is the
  most convenient for reviewing.
* Important dates:
  - title, abstract and keywords by November 3
  - paper submission by January 31, 2008.
* If you have any questions about this Special Issue, please email
  VLL@cs.dal.ca.

ABZ 2008 CONFERENCE
   September 16-18, 2008
   BCS London Offices, Covent Garden, London, UK
   Call for Papers
* Abstract State Machines (ASM), B and Z stand for three rigorous
  methods that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely
  used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis
  of hardware and software systems.  This conference is dedicated
  to the cross-fertilization of these three related state-based
  and machine-based formal methods.  The program spans from
  theoretical and methodological foundations to practical
  applications, emphasizing system engineering methods and tools
  that are distinguished by mathematical rigor and have proved to
  be industrially viable.  A main goal of the conference is to
  contribute to the integration of accurate state- and
  machine-based system development methods, clarifying their
  commonalities and differences to better understand how to
  combine related approaches for accomplishing the various tasks
  in modelling, experimental validation, and mathematical
  verification of reliable high-quality hardware/software systems.
* The conference will be articulated into a one-day common program
  of invited lectures and two days of contributed papers.
*  Although organized logistically as an integral event, editorial
  control of the joint conference remains vested in three separate
  programme committees, which will respectively determine its ASM,
  B and Z content, to be presented in parallel conference tracks
  with a schedule to allow the participants to switch between the
  sessions.  The conference simultaneously incorporates the 15th
  International ASM Workshop, the 17th International Conference of
  Z Users and the 8th International Conference on the B Method.
  It will be preceded by a tutorial day and Verified Software
  Repository Network (VSR-net) workshop on Monday, September 15.
* A case study for design and verification of a flash-based file
  system is suggested to the participants.  Leo Freitas and Jim
  Woodcock will organize a series of intermediate workshops where
  those who decide to work on the problem can meet to enhance the
  collaborative aspect of the work. For details see:
  http://www.abz2008.org/
* The papers are planned to be published in a volume of Springer's
  LNCS series.  Contributions are solicited on all aspects of the
  theory and applications of ASMs, B, Z and related approaches in
  software/hardware engineering, including the development of
  tools and industrial applications.
* Two kinds of contributions are invited:
  1. Research papers: full papers (not extended abstracts) of not
     more than 12 pages (in LNCS format), which have to be original,
     unpublished and not submitted  elsewhere.  Papers dealing with
     the case study are particularly welcome.
  2. Short presentations of work in progress, industrial
     experience reports and tool demonstrations.  An extended
     abstract of not more than 3 pages is expected and will be
     reviewed.  The volume of accepted extended abstracts will be
     made available at the time of the conference on the website of
     the conference, a 1-page abstract of each presentation will be
     published in the Proceedings.

___________________________________________________________________

The 35th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and
Programming, the main conference and annual meeting of the European
Association for Theoretical Computer Science EATCS will take place
from the 6th to the 13th of July 2008 in Reykjavik, Iceland. The main
conference will take place from the 7th till the 11th of July, and
will be preceded and followed by 13 co-located events. (See
http://www.ru.is/icalp08/workshops.html for the list of events
affiliated with ICALP 2008.) In addition, the ETACS award 2008 and the
Goedel prize 2008 will be awarded at the conference.

Following the successful experience of the last three editions, ICALP
2008 will complement the established structure of the scientific
program based on Track A on Algorithms, Automata, Complexity and
Games, and Track B on Logic, Semantics, and Theory of Programming,
corresponding to the two main streams of the journal Theoretical
Computer Science, with a special Track C on Security and Cryptography

[Apologies for multiple copies]

Call for contributions.

	        Workshop on
            MODAL FIXPOINT LOGICS
     http://staff.science.uva.nl/~yde/mfl

to be held at the Institute of Logic, Language, and Computation,
Amsterdam,  March 25-27 2008.

Modal fixpoint logics constitute a research field of considerable
interest, not only because of their many applications, but also
because of their rich logical/mathematical theory. Systems such as
LTL, PDL, CTL, and the modal mu-calculus, originate from computer
science, and are for instance applied in the theory of program
specification and verification. The richness of their theory stems
from the deep connections with various fields in logic, mathematics,
and theoretical computer science, such as lattices and universal
(co-)algebra, modal logic, automata, and game theory.

Large areas of the theory of modal fixpoint logics, in particular the
connection with the theory of automata and games, have been
intensively investigated and are by now are well
understood. Nevertheless, there are still many aspects that are less
explored. This applies in particular to the model theory, intended as
the study of a logic as a function of classes of models, the proof
theory, the algebraic logic, duality theory in the spirit of
Stone/Priestly duality, and the relation to the theory of ordered sets
as grounding the concept of "least fixpoint".

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers from various
backgrounds, in particular, computer scientists and pure logicians,
who share an interest in the area. The invited talks together will
represent an overview of the richness of the theory of modal fixpoint
logics.

While most of the available time will be devoted to the invited talks,
there will be some opportunity for contributed talks as well. We
invite contributed talks on all aspects of fixpoint logics, including
their proof theory, model theory, algebraic aspects, connections with
automata and games, and algorithmic issues. However, talks that focus
on the logical theory of modal fixpoint logics will be given
preference.

Researchers interested in giving a contributed talk should send by
February 1, 2008 a short abstract (one page at most, in pdf format)
describing the content of their contribution to Luigi Santocanale
(luigi.santocanale@lif.univ-mrs.fr). Acceptance of presentations
will be notified by February 11, 2008.

Important dates:
       1/02/2008  Submission of abstracts

Here's another one of these internal/external questions: the fact that
an object N with structure map a: N + 1 -> N in a topos is an NNO can be
expressed by axioms

	ALL d: B + 1 -> B. EX! f: N -> B. f a =3D d (f + 1)

for every object B, where the quantifiers are external, i.e. range over
all morphisms. Does it follow that these formulas hold also internally,
i.e. in the internal logic of the topos? (The universal quantifier
implicit in the EX! can, of course, be internalised, as a is an
isomorphism by Lambek's lemma. I mean the outer universal quantifier for =
d.)

Thanks,

Lutz Schr=F6der

A genoid is a category of only two objects (A, G) such that G is the product
of A with itself (thus G is also the product of any finite power of A with
itself). It is a remarkable fact that such a simple concept can be used to
define all of the fundamental algebraic theories, including lambda calculus
and first order logic. Progress made in this direction is presented at a
newly created website entitled "Clones <http://www.algebraic.net/cag>  and
Genoids" (http://www.algebraic.net/cag).

                           Journal of K-Theory

The Editorial Board of the "Journal of K-Theory" has the pleasure of
informing you that forthcoming articles are now available online at
http://www.journals.cambridge.org/jkt .The online and print issues of the
journal will start in January/February 2008.

The board apologizes, especially to the authors of manuscripts
submitted in the recent past, for the confusion, delays, and inadequate
communication arising during the transition of the board from the
journal "K-Theory"

The profits to be realized by the journal will serve as a basis for
an international conference in K-theory during the academic year 2010-
2011 in conjunction with Andrei Suslin's 60th birthday. Chances are
that additional funds can be found to augment JKT funding.

The long term commitment of the journal is to use profits derived
from publishing to support educational and scientific activities
concerning K-theory.

The answer is yes; and it follows from the fact that if N is a NNO in E
then B^*N is a NNO in E/B, for any B. (This depends on the fact that E
is cartesian closed; cf. Remark A2.5.3 in the Elephant.) What is perhaps
more remarkable is that an object in a topos satisfies "Peano's
induction postulate" internally iff it does so externally (cf. Elephant,
D5.5.1): that is, one can replace an internal quantification over PN
by an external quantification over Sub(N).

We're hiring:

http://www.jobs.ac.uk/jobs/TN992/Lectureship_Senior_Lectureship_Readershi=
p/

There are three posts available, one in analysis and the other two in any
pure area (including category theory).  All are tenured.

For those unfamiliar with UK terminology, here's a brief explanation of
the job titles.  Someone with tenure is called a lecturer, senior
lecturer, reader or professor.  A lectureship is the most junior post (bu=
t
not like an American lectureship).  Senior lecturer and reader are
intermediate posts; SL is more oriented towards teaching, and reader
towards research.  There are rather few professors (maybe 20% of the
faculty), and it's perfectly normal to end one's career without ever
becoming one.

Feel free to get in touch if you have questions.  (I'll be away from my
mail for a few days.)

Clones and Genoids in Lambda Calculus and First Order Logic



Zhaohua Luo



Abstract:



A genoid is a system (A, G, x, +) consists of a monoid (G, e),

a right act A of G, x in A, + in G, such that for any a in

A and u in G there is a unique element [a, u] in G such that

x[a, u] = a and +[a, u] = u. A genoid represents a category

with two objects such that one is the product of itself with the other.



For any right act P of G, we define a new right act P^A =

(P, *) by a*u = a[x, u], which is the exponent

in the cartesian closed category of right acts of G.



We define a lambda calculus to be a genoid (A, G)

together with homomorphisms L: A^A -> A and A X A -> A

such that (La)+x = a and L(a+x) = a for any a in A.

This means that A^A and A are isomorphic as right acts of G.



A quantifier algebra for a genoid (A, G) is a right act P

of G, together with homomorphisms E: P^A -> P, F: P^0 -> P,

and =>: P X P -> P, such that p for any p, q in P:

(i) {F, =>} defines a Boolean algebra P.

(ii) E (p V q) = (E p) V (E q).

(iii) p < E p.

I got a note from a student named Benjamin Jackson saying that someone had
told him that to define a *-autonomous category, you need only a symmetric
monoidal category and a contravariant involution * such that Hom(A @ B,C*)
= Hom(A,(B @ C)*).  Here "=" means natural equivalence and @ is the tensor
product.  Not only is this apparently true but that equivalence is needed
only for A = I, the tensor unit.  Of course, what is going on is that all
the coherence is built-in to the structure of a symmetric monoidal
category.

First define A --o B = (A @ B*)*.  Then the isomorphism above implies that
    Hom(A,B) = Hom(I @ A,B) = Hom(I,(A @ B*)*) = Hom(I,A --o B)
Next we see that
    (A @ B) --o C = (A @ B @ C*)* = A --o (B @ C*)* = A --o (B --o C)
and, applying Hom(I,-), that
       Hom(A @ B,C) = Hom(A,B --o C)
Also we have that
  A --o I* = (A @ I)* = A* and A --o B = (A @ B*)* = (B* @ A)* = B* --o A*
which gives the structure of a *-autonomous category with dualizing
object I*.

The trouble with this is that generally speaking it is the --o which is
obvious and the tensor is derived from it.  The coherences involving
internal hom alone are much less well-known, although they are included
in the original Eilenberg-Kelly paper in the La Jolla Proceedings.
Still I am surprised that I never noticed this before.

			      FMCS 2008
      16th Workshop on Foundational Methods in Computer Science
		Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada
			May 30 - June 1, 2008

	    http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/fmcs2008/

			  FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

				* * *

 Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop
 bringing together researchers in mathematics and computer science with
 a focus on the application of category theory in computer science.

 This year's meeting will be hosted in the Department of Mathematics
 and Statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.

 There will be an informal welcome reception in the evening of May 29.
 The scientific program starts on May 30, and consists of a day of
 tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to category theory, as well
 as a day and a half of research talks. The meeting ends at mid-day on
 June 1.

 FMCS 2008 takes place one week after MFPS 2008 (which will be held at
 the University of Pennsylvania). We hope that this will enable and
 encourage participants from overseas to attend both conferences!

Research talks

 There will be some invited presentations, but the majority of the
 talks are solicited from the participants. If you wish to give a talk
 please send a title and abstract to fmcs2008@mathstat.dal.ca. Time
 slots are limited, so please register early if you would like to be
 considered for a talk.

Student support

 Graduate student participation is particularly encouraged at
 FMCS. Students will pay a reduced registration fee. We will also be
 able to provide limited financial support; if you are interested in
 this, please email us at fmcs2008@mathstat.dal.ca.

Special session

 There will be a special session in honor of Ernie Manes' 65th
 birthday. The special session organizer is Phil Mulry.

Accommodations

 We have reserved a block of rooms at the King's College residences.
 The rate, including taxes, are $37.37 per night for a single room,
 and $56.04 for a double room. Reservations can be made by sending an
 e-mail to conferences@admin.ukings.ns.ca and mentioning "FMCS 2008".
 Please make your reservations early to ensure availability.

Registration

 Please register for the meeting by emailing fmcs2008@mathstat.dal.ca.
 There will be a reasonable on-site registration fee to cover meeting
 costs.

Previous meetings

 Previous FMCS meetings were held in Pullman (1992), Portland (1993),

Dear Mike,

first, the definition that you "never noticed before" appears as
Definition C in your paper "Non-symmetric *-autonomous categories"
(Theoretical Computer Science, 139 (1995), 115-130). Okay, there are
minor differences, e.g., in that paper you considered the
non-symmetric case and you didn't require * to be an involution.

The definition precisely as stated in your email (and not in your
paper) is problematic: one obtains two canonical isomorphisms A ->
A**, and they do not in general coincide. Namely, the first such
morphisms is the isomorphism invol : A -> A** that comes from the
requirement "contravariant involution". The second one is lift : A ->
A** and comes from the monoidal closed structure. It is given
explicitly by the following string of equivalences:

= Hom(X, A)
= Hom(A*, X*)
= Hom(I, (A* @ X)*)  ax
= Hom(I, (X @ A*)*)  sym
= Hom(X, A**)        ax

To see that they do not, in general, coincide, consider a *-autonomous
category C in which there exists a non-trivial natural isomorphism
eta_A : A -> A from the identity functor to itself (for example,
finite dimensional vector spaces where eta is multiplication by -1).
Consider the usual functor (-)* and the usual isomophism Hom(A @
B,C*) = Hom(A,(B @ C)*). Let invol : A -> A** be the usual involution,
and let invol' = invol o eta: A -> A -> A**. Then invol' defines
another structure of "contravariant involution" on the functor
(-)*, different from lift.

Therefore, in general, for this definition to be useable, one needs
another coherence condition stating that invol = lift.  Or else, one
can just drop the a priori requirement that * is involutive, and just
let it follow from the other structure (as you did in the above-cited
paper).

This seems a good moment to mention that another definition of
*-autonomous category, which occasionally appears in the literature,
suffers from a similar affliction. Some authors define a *-autonomous
category to be a symmetric monoidal category C together with a functor
(-)* : C^op -> C and a natural isomorphism Hom(A @ B, C) = Hom(A, (B @
C*)*). Although this definition does not a priori assume * to be
involutive, it still yields two canonical maps C -> C** that do not in
general coincide, and therefore, it is missing a coherence condition.
The two competing maps f_1 and f_2 are given as follows:

   (A, A)   ==   (A x I, A)
            ==   (A, (I x A*)*)            (ax)
            ==   (A, A**).

   (A*, A*) ==   (A*, (A x I**)*)          (##)
            ==   (A* x A, I*)              (ax)
            ==   (A x A*, I*)
            ==   (A, (A* x I**)*)          (ax)
            ==   (A, A**)                  (##)

Here, (ax) is the axiom, and (##) denotes an application of the
isomorphism I = I**, which can be obtained by letting A=B=C in (ax).
To see that they don't in general coincide, consider the same
counterexample as above, and modify the isomorphism (ax) by
multiplication with the scalar -1. Since it is used an odd number of
times in the definition of f_1, but an even number of times in the
definition of f_2, it follows that f_1 != f_2.


On the other hand, none of the above matters in some sense, due to a
theorem proved last year by Robin Houston (it was previously unknown
at least to me):

 Theorem. Let C be a symmetric monoidal category, and let D be an object.
 If there *exists* a natural isomorphism f : A -> (A -o D) -o D,
 then the *canonical* natural transformation g : A -> (A -o D) -o D
 (coming from the symmetric monoidal structure) is an isomorphism
 (although it may in general be different from f).

Therefore, in the definition of *-autonomous category, the mere
existence of an isomorphism (not necessarily satisfying coherence
conditions) already implies the existence of a (possibly different)
isomorphism satisfying all the coherence conditions. In this sense,
both the Hom(A @ B,C*) = Hom(A,(B @ C)*) definition and the Hom(A @
B,C*) = Hom(A,(B @ C)*) definition are correct: they certainly imply
that the underlying category is *-autonomous - although not necessarily
with the given structure!

I suspect I may not have been the first to notice this, since it's
fairly easy, though I'm not aware that it's ever been mentioned
in print. (If anyone knows otherwise, I'd be interested to hear.)


Claim: Let C be a symmetric monoidal closed category, and
let D be an object of C. Then the following are equivalent:

1. There exists a natural isomorphism A = (A -o D) -o D,
2. The functor (- -o D) is full and faithful,
3. The canonical natural transformation A -> (A -o D) -o D is
   invertible.


Lemma 1. Let G: X -> Y and H: Y -> Z be functors. If HG is faithful
then G is faithful; if HG is full and G is essentially surjective,
then H is full.

Proof: easy.

Lemma 2. Let C be a category, and F: C -> C an endofunctor. If FF
is naturally isomorphic to 1_C, then F is an equivalence.

Proof: Certainly F is essentially surjective, since every object
X in C is naturally isomorphic to FFX. It then follows by Lemma 1
that F is full and faithful.


For the implication 1 => 2, take F = (- -o D) in Lemma 2.


For the implication 2 => 3, consider the following sequence of
isomorphisms natural in A \in C:

    C(A, A)
 -> C(A -o D,  A -o D)       ;apply the functor (- -o D)
 =  C((A -o D) @ A, D)       ;closure
 =  C(A @ (A -o D), D)       ;symmetry of tensor
 =  C(A,  (A -o D) -o D)     ;closure again

By definition, this natural transformation corresponds under Yoneda
to the canonical A -> (A -o D) -o D. Since (- -o D) is full and faithful,
the first step is invertible; the others are necessarily so. Therefore,
by the Yoneda correspondence, the canonical natural transformation with
components A -> (A -o D) -o D is invertible.

[ Robin Cockett pointed out to me that this can be decomposed into
  two steps, one easy and one well-known:
   a) The functor (- -o D) is self-adjoint on the right.
   b) For any adjunction, the left adjoint is full and faithful
      if and only if the unit of the adjunction is invertible. ]


Finally, the implication 3 => 1 is immediate.

[Note from moderator: This item is off topic. It is sent with the
understanding, and agreement of the poster, that any response be sent
directly to him, not to the list.]

Dear Colleagues,

As a member of the Executive Committee of my department, I was given the
task of gathering information on exam practices/policies in preparation
for estalishing our own policy.

I would like to ask for your help by sharing with me your own
experience/practices/policies:


A. Grade vs. mark

1. At the end of the term, do you assign a mark (like 87) or a letter
grade (like A or A+) -- or both?

2. How do you convert numeric marks to letter grades? (Is there a
departmental/faculty/university standard for this?)

3. Is the conversion scheme from numeric marks to letter grades public
(i.e., known to students) or kept in secret?

4. Do you have to tell your students the conversion scheme at the
beginning of the term?

5. Do you tell students their mark on the final exam, or only their letter
grade?


B. Appeals

1. How appeals are handled? Is there an appeal fee? How much?

2. Can students have (supervised) access to their final exams before or
during the appeal period/process?

3. Can students request a photocopy of their exam (examination notebook)?
What is the fee?


I would like to thank in advance everyone who responds to this.


Happy holidays!

Gabi

I would like help on an expository point when using structures such as a =
tensor product in a practical situation, and where one does not want to =
overload the reader, and make things seem more complicated than =
necessary.=20

I accept the excellent example in CFTWM p.164 2nd edition that even for =
the cartesian product one cannot get a strict associativity isomorphism. =
However when dealing say with tensor product of modules over a =
commutative ring, one feels that the tensor product associativity is no =
less strict than the usual product of sets, because of the definition by =
the universal bilinear property, which extends to 3-fold tensor products =
and trilinearity. Has this feeling been clearly expressed in the =
literature?=20

Again, is there an exposition of say the tensor algebra of a vector =
space which adequately (in your view) takes account of coherence?=20

I am trying to finalise an account of tensor products of crossed =
complexes, a much more complicated situation, but where the same ideas =
arise.=20

There is a silly mistake here, caused by the fact that the functor
(- -o D) is contravariant. The error is really in the statement of
Lemma 2; of course the proof still works for contravariant F.

Call for Papers

-----------------------------------------------------------------

4th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2008)
Leicester, United Kingdom,
September 7 - 13, 2008,
http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/icgt2008/

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The 4th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2008)=20
will be held in Leicester (United Kingdom) in the second week of=20
September 2008,  along with several satellite events. It continues the=20
line of conferences previously held in Barcelona (Spain) in 2002, Rome=20
(Italy) in 2004, and Natal  (Brazil) in 2006 as well as a series of six=20
International Workshops on Graph Transformation with Applications in=20
Computer Science between 1978 and 1998, and alternates with the workshop=20
series on Application of Graph Transformation with Industrial Relevance.=20
The conference takes place under the auspices of EATCS, EASST, and IFIP=20
WG 1.3. Awards will be given by EATCS and EASST for the best theoretical=20
and application-oriented papers. Proceedings are planned with Springer's=20
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Scope of the Conference:

Graphs are among the simplest and most universal models for a variety of=20
systems, not just in computer science, but throughout engineering and=20
the life sciences. When systems evolve we are interested in the way they=20
change, to predict, support, or react to their evolution. Graph=20
transformation combines the idea of graphs as a universal modelling=20
paradigm with a rule-based approach to specify evolution. The area is=20
concerned with both the theory of graph transformation and their=20
application to a variety of domains.

The conference aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners=20
interested in the foundations and application of graph transformation to=20
a variety of areas. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to

* foundations and theory of
      o General models of graph transformatio
      o High-level and adhesive replacement systems
      o Node-, edge-, and hyperedge replacement grammars
      o Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformations
      o Term graph rewriting
      o Hierarchical graphs and decompositions of graphs
      o Logic expression of graph transformation properties
      o Graph theoretical properties of graph languages
      o Geometrical and topological aspects of graph transformation
      o Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages
      o Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems
      o Structuring and modularization concepts for transformation system=
s
      o Graph transformation and Petri nets

* application to, languages and tool support for
      o Software architecture
      o Workflows and business processes
      o Software quality and testing
      o Software evolution
      o Access control and security models
      o Aspect-oriented development
      o Model-driven development, especially model transformations
      o Domain-specific languages
      o Implementation of programming languages
      o Bioinformatics and system biology
      o Natural computing
      o Image generation and pattern recognition techniques
      o Massively parallel computing
      o Self-adaptive systems and ubiquitous computing
      o Service-oriented applications and semantic web
      o Rule- and knowledge-based systems

Venue:

Located in the heart of England, Leicester is a truly multi-cultural=20
city. The city is a historic meeting place, where for centuries people=20
of different races and cultures have gathered, creating a rich and=20
unique heritage. This diversity continues today with a thriving ethnic=20
minority community accounting for more than a third of Leicester's=20
population. ICGT 2008 will be held at the University of Leicester's=20
conference facility next to the Universiy's botanic gardens.

This result is a special case of a general fact about adjunctions,
which appears (yes, really!) as Lemma A1.1.1 in the Elephant.
I don't claim any originality for it, but I did comment in the
text that it "seems not to be widely known".

Lemma: Let F: C --> D be a functor having a right adjoint G.
If there is any natural isomorphism between the composite FG and
the identity functor on D, then the counit of the adjunction is
an isomorphism.

Proof: One can transport the comonad structure on FG across the
isomorphism, to obtain a comonad structure on 1_D. But the monoid
of natural endomorphisms of the identity functor on any category
is commutative, so the counit and comultiplication of this comonad
must be inverse isomorphisms. Transporting back again, the counit
of (F -| G) is an isomorphism.

CiE 2008 is the fourth in a series of conferences organised by CiE
(Computability in Europe), a European network of mathematicians,
logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and
others interested in new developments in computability and their
underlying significance for the real world. Previous meetings took
place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006) and Siena (2007).

CiE 2008 aims at bridging the gap from the logical methods of
mathematical and meta-mathematical flavour to the applied and
industrial questions that are involved in devising and choosing
the right algorithms and analysing their effectiveness and efficiency.

Dear All, or at least all who know Flemish or Dutch.
I have been trying to understand / translate part of a thesis in
Flemish and have come upon a word (in the context of fibred
categories) that my online dictionaries cannot handle at all.  It
seems to be a current word in the languages as Google turns up lots of
hits but none gives me enough of an idea of a more or less equivalent
English or French word.  The word is
                           heroprichten
Can any one help?

To all and sundry categorical, Happy New Year

Tim Porter

Dear all,

I would like to thank all those who have replied to my e-mail about
the Dutch term heroprichten.  It was used in a thesis of 1976 on
non-Abelian cohomology, referring to the obstruction to lifting a
section of a stack or gerbe back along a morphism of such and means
`re-establish' or similar depending on context. Lifting would seem to
be a possible translation in some contexts and `re-construct' in
others -where it is a verblike situation.  So thanks.

Once again `Happy New Year to everyone for 2008'.

Tim
