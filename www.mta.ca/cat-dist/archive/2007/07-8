The very last PhD thesis from Bangor (for the foreseeable future) is now
available on the website. In it Richard Lewis looks at the problem of the
interpretation of the formal maps to a crossed module introduced by
Porter and Turaev and using a simplicial analogue of etale spaces gets a
representation in terms of locally constant stacks.

All for now,

Tim

PS.  The abstract follows

Stacks and formal maps of crossed modules
Abstract:
If X is a topological space then there is an equivalence between the
category \pi_1(X)-Set, of actions of the fundamental group of X on sets,
and the category of covering spaces on X. Moreover the latter is also
equivalent to the category of locally constant sheaves on X.
Grothendieck has conjectured that this should be the 'n=3D1' case of a
result which is true for all n, and it is the 'n=3D2' case we look at in
this thesis.
The desired generalisation should replace actions of the group \pi_1(X)
(which is an algebraic model for the 1-type of X) by actions of a crossed
module (i.e., by an algebraic model for the 2-type) on groupoids; 'locally
constant sheaves of sets' by 'locally constant stacks of groupoids'; and
'covering space' by a locally trivial object whose fibres are groupoids.
This last object we handle using the machinery of simplicial fibre bundles
(twisted Cartesian products) and formal maps, building a simplicial
object, Z(\lambda), where the fibre is now a (nerve of) a groupoid. To
interpret Z(\lambda) as a stack, we show that just as sheaves on X are
equivalent to etale spaces, we can define a notion of 2-etale space
corresponding to stacks and show that from Z(\lambda) we can construct a
locally constant stack on X.

Dear List Members,

two days ago I posted a message asking whether there is a formal
definition of parsimony for fundamental scientific theories, perhaps
using category theory.

Here is a short summary of answers I received:

Ralph Wojtowicz recommended to have a look at Part D in Volume II of
Johnstone's "Sketches of an Elephant", which as he wrote contains
discussions of constructions involving translations between formal
systems and their semantic categories.

As an example for parsimony in category theory, Eduardo Ochs suggested
the have a look at the relationships between set theory, local set
theories, and elementary toposes.

The paper by F. Wiedijk, "Is ZF a hack? Comparing the complexity of
some (formalist interpretations of) foundational systems for
mathematics", Journal of Applied Logic 4, 622-645, 2006 ps.gz pdf dvi
via http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/pubs/index.html also was recommended.

Many thanks to all respondents and also to Vaughan Pratt for his
refreshing critical remarks!

The answer to the question appears to be more difficult than I had
expected.  As often in philosophy, this may be to a good extent due to
difficulties in explaining what the question is.  One important point
which I failed to clarify is the difference between fundamental
mathematical theories and fundamental scientific theories.
Fundamental scientific theories may, I think, assume the fundamental
mathematical theory to be given.  They should not describe all
possible structures but, on the contrary, pick from the mathematically
given structures those that are physically realized.  This difference
might also put the problem of parsimony for scientific theories into a
different light.  But I'm not sure, of course.

So long,

Axel

  OPEN LETTER from the Board of Editors of the Journal of K-theory

 Dear fellow mathematicians,

 The Editorial Board of 'K-Theory' has resigned. A new journal titled
 'Journal of K-theory' has been formed, with essentially the same Board
 of Editors. The members are A.Bak, P.Balmer, S.J.Bloch, G.E.Carlsson,
 A.Connes, E.Friedlander, M.Hopkins, B.Kahn, M.Karoubi, G.G.Kasparov, A.S.
 Merkurjev, A.Neeman, T.Porter, D.Quillen, J.Rosenberg, A.A.Suslin, G.Tang,
 B.Totaro, V.Voevodsky, C.Weibel, and Guoliang Yu.

 The new journal is to be distributed by Cambridge University Press. The
 price is 380 British pounds, which is significantly less than half that of
 the old journal. Publication will begin in January 2008. We ask for your
 continued support, in particular at the current time. Your submissions
 are welcome and may be sent to any of the editors.

Congratulations, Tim.  This is something to celebrate.  Mathematicians
and librarians the world over should be grateful to you and the other
editors: you're both saving us money and bringing another journal back
under the full control of academics.

Of course, the pattern of naming now established (Topology becomes
Journal of Topology, K-Theory becomes Journal of K-Theory) presents a
problem: what's JPAA going to do?

Tom

Of course, it will become Pure and Applied Algebra.  Not that I much care.
It started as the flagship journal of category theory, but has long since
escaped our grasp.  At any rate, it is about time, the editors resigned.

Is there a `barycentric' subdivision operator Sd on categories
such that with N = nerve
SdN = NSd
?
and how many other notions of Sd are there?

	The Dedekind Reals in Abstract Stone Duality
		www.PaulTaylor.EU/ASD

Andrej Bauer is a co-author of this paper, but not of this posting
about it.

We construct something that was supposed to be impossible: a model of
(topology containing) the real line that satisfies the Heine--Borel
theorem (the closed interval is compact in the "finite open sub-cover"
sense) but in which all terms are computable.

This fails in the "obvious" model of recursive analysis, ie the subset
of real numbers that are representable by programs, roughly because we
can enumerate them, and cover them with intervals of length m.2^-k for
any chosen m (say 1/4). Then recursive [0,1] is covered by total length
2m (=1/2), but no finite subcover is enough.   The clearest account of
this counterexample that I have seen is in Bridges & Richman,
"Varieties of Constructive Mathematics", LMS Lecture Notes 97,
CUP, 1987, Section 3.4.

The reason why the Heine--Borel theorem holds in ASD is that, like
locale theory and formal topology, it is an account of topology based
on open subspaces and not points.   But, unlike them, ASD is presented
as a lambda calculus that makes it LOOK like a point-based theory, and
therefore shows up exactly what the difference is.

This paper appeared in the proceedings of "Computability and
Complexity in Analysis" (Kyoto, August 2005), but since then it has
been completely rewritten, and almost every lemma has been re-thought
-- so it's worth re-reading.  It now provides the best available
introduction to the construction of topology in ASD, and also compares
the construction and properties of the real line in ASD with those in
locale theory, formal topology and constructive analysis.

SS 11-13 of the paper also consider real arithmetic and the relationship
between Dedekind completeness and the Archimedean axiom.

It has just been submitted to a journal, so we would still welcome
comments.

Below I shall explain the category theoretic idea behind this
construction.  For further discussion of constructive analysis in ASD,
you should see SS 1 & 15 of the paper itself, and "A Lambda
Calculus for Real Analysis", which was also presented at CCA 2005,
and has been revised a lot, but is not yet ready to go to a journal.

---

Before I describe this work, I feel that the time has come to make a
disclaimer:
      ABSTRACT STONE DUALITY IS *NOT* ESCARDO'S SYNTHETIC TOPOLOGY

Martin Escardo's paper "Synthetic topology of data types and classical
spaces" (ENTCS 87 (2004) 21--156 or www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe) is a very
interesting collection of material drawn from the literature on the
boundaries of topology and recursion theory.  If it had been written
by somebody ten years earlier, as it could and perhaps should have been,
it would have provided a very useful background to my work on ASD.

However, the main use to which I would have put an earlier version of
that paper would have been to say WHAT ASD IS NOT.  In particular,
Martin describes the failure of compactness of Cantor space and of the
closed real interval in recursive analysis.  The theory that he then
discusses is a form of "relative computability", which bolts recursion
theory on to classical topology.  The best developed form of this
approach is Klaus Weihrauch's "Type Two Effectivity", on which Vasco
Brattka (www.cca-net.de/vasco) is the most productive researcher.

In ASD, Cantor space and [0,1] are compact, but this is not achieved
by bolting recursion theory on to classical topology.  ASD is a direct
axiomatisation of the ideas of general topology, not based on set
theory or recursion theory.

The features that are common to Martin's work and mine are that
  - the topology on a space X is seen as the exponential Sigma^X,
    where Sigma is the Sierpinski space; I would attribute this to
    Dana Scott's "Continuous Lattices" (LNM 274 (1972) 97-136); and

  - compactness of a space K is captured by a "universal quantifier"
    all_K : Sigma^K -> Sigma;  I picked up this idea from 1970s locale
    theory and categorical logic.

I took these ideas for granted a long time ago, they appeared in the
first ASD paper in 2000, and I have since developed them into a
complete axiomatisation of computably based locally compact spaces.

If Martin had developed his own calculus for topology based on similar
ideas, it would have been possible to write (the paper and) this
posting as an ordinary comparison of scientific theories, just as we
do with locale theory, etc: "the Heine--Borel theorem holds in ASD but
not in Escardo's calculus because of such-and-such".

Unfortunately, there is no "Escardo's calculus".  Indeed, I recently
put it to him that he could eliminate the friction between us either
by working with me on ASD, or by proposing some other axiom system,
but he declined.  He doesn't want to take a view on whether
Heine--Borel is true or false.  Therefore no scientific comparison
is possible, and I have to make this disclaimer instead.

However, the reason why I consider it necessary to make such a
statement is not actually because of Martin himself. His research is
not my business, and this is not an issue of priority or plagiarism.
My complaint is against those who go around saying that Martin presents
MY work better than I do myself, whereas in fact the fundamental
ideas of ASD (see below) get no mention in his account.

I encourage Martin to clarify (on "categories") both which specific
results he claims as HIS OWN, and more generally what the message of
"Synthetic Topology" is, as distinct from ASD.  On the other hand,
I would ask other people to read my papers properly.

----

THE MONADIC PRINCIPLE

As a research programme, ASD is an example of a maxim due to Paul
Dirac that Ronnie Brown quoted on "categories" on 8 June 2007:

 >>  One should allow oneself to be led in the direction which the
 >>  mathematics suggests... one must follow up a mathematical idea
 >>  and see what its consequences are, even though one gets led to
 >>  a domain which is completely foreign to what one started
 >>  with.... Mathematics can lead us in a direction we would not
 >>  take if we only followed up physical ideas by themselves.

The mathematical idea that I followed in this way was a standard
categorical one, and the following account is intended for
categorists.  It explains how the application of this idea led
"directly" to important fundamental principles in real analysis.

The idea (in 1993) was that, not only is the topology on X given by
the exponential Sigma^X as above, but also

    the self-adjunction   Sigma^(-)  -|   Sigma^(-)  is monadic.

I still don't know where I picked up the idea that adjunctions "ought"
to be monadic.  Maybe it was just that lots of interesting categories
turn up that way.  The main inspiration was Bob Pare's "Colimits in
Topoi" (Bull AMS 80 (1974) 556), where he shows that any elementary
topos has this property, with Sigma=Omega.

A famous theorem of Jon Beck characterises monadic adjunctions
F -| U  by two clauses:
- U reflects invertibility, and
- U preserves U-split coequalisers.

----

SOBRIETY

In the context of ASD, the first clause is equivalent to saying that
every object X is SOBER, ie it is the equaliser of the diagram

                            eta_Sigma^2 X         Sigma^ Sigma^X
         eta_X      Sigma^X ------------>     Sigma
     X  >-----> Sigma       ------------> Sigma
                            Sigma^2 eta_X

When we apply this principle to the two most important ground types of
mathematics (in the context of suitable extra structure), we find that

- sobriety for N is equivalent to definition by description
   (Sober Spaces and Continuations, SS 9-10)

- sobriety for R is equivalent to Dedekind completeness
   (Dedekind Reals in ASD, S 14).

Sobriety is slightly stronger than the property of repleteness that
Martin Hyland introduced in synthetic domain theory in 1991.

Essentially, all of these ideas say HOW LOGIC IMPACTS ON NUMERICAL
COMPUTATION.  They can be formulated as "introduction rules" in a
type-theoretic style in which the elimination rules are given by
equality, arithmetic order or lambda-application.  To put this another
way, sobriety completes the square of types of operations:

         results:  numerical              logical
   arguments:
     numerical:    arithmetic (+ - x /)   relations (= < > !=)

       logical:    sobriety (cut descr)   logic (and or exists all)

There are normalisation theorems that say that any numerical term
built from these four sets of operations is equivalent to a purely
logical one, with numerical variables and constants on the inside and
a single sobriety operator on the outside.  Computation is then by
logic programming. (See "Interval analysis without intervals".)

-----

MONADICITY

Turning to the more difficult half of Beck's theorem, this yields
the Heine--Borel theorem, and also compactness of Cantor space, 2^N.

In fact it was already known that (Dedekind completeness and) the
Heine--Borel theorem are consequences of the view that the algebra
of open sets is fundamental in topology, and not the set of points.
Fourman & Hyland showed this for locales (LNM 753 (1979) 280-301)
and Negri for formal topology (LNCS 1158 (1996)).  Because of the
monadic principle, ASD is also an "open sets" account of topology.

We say that a subspace   i : X >---> Y  is  SIGMA-SPLIT  if there's
a map   I : Sigma^X >---> Sigma^Y  such that  Sigma^i . I = id.
Monadicity provides for the existence of Sigma-split subspaces.

The representation of reals as Dedekind cuts defines a subspace
     i : R >--->  Sigma^Q x Sigma^Q

The crucial observation (in S 2 of "Dedekind reals in ASD") is that
this subspace is Sigma-split, classically, using the fact that [0,1]
is compact.  (This result is already significant in interval analysis:
it says that interval computations can be made arbitarily accurate by
making the interval arguments narrow enough.)

The idempotent composite E = I . Sigma^i can be expressed entirely in
terms of the rationals, not the reals.  This is the key idea of the
construction of R in ASD (S 8), and the same formula E turns up again
in the definitions of the quantifiers that make [0,1] compact and R
overt (SS 9-10):
     all  x:[d,u].phi x   =   I phi (lambda x.x<d, lambda x.u<x)
     some x:[d,u].phi x   =   I phi (lambda x.x<u, lambda x.d<x)
S 14 reproduces the classical argument in ASD to show that R is unique.

Altogether, the Sigma-splitting I and the universal quantifier
all_[0,1] are inter-definable.  In the models of recursive analysis
where Heine--Borel fails, the map I also does not exist (or if it
does, it's not Scott continuous).  If, as Martin Escardo does, you
believe that compactness is defined by a quantifier Sigma^K -> Sigma,
ie a term of one higher type, surely you should be willing to accept
an inter-definable term of another higher type (I:Sigma^X >---> Sigma^Y)
as the categorical explanation of the Heine--Borel theorem. This term
also exists in the "relative computability" models: what ASD does is
to abstract the computable, topological ideas away from proofs that
rely on non-topological, non-computable set-theoretic hypotheses.

Sigma-split subspaces also provide a simple categorical
characterisation of local compactness: X is locally compact iff it can
be expressed as a Sigma-split subspace of Sigma^N.  ("Computably
based locally compact spaces".)

----

THE MONADIC LAMBDA CALCULUS

What sets ASD apart from locale theory and formal topology is that it
LOOKS as if it's based on "points", whereas locale theory looks like
lattice theory, and formal topology works with basic open sets and
coverage relations.

How does ASD manage this?

We now have 40 years experience of the interpretation of lambda
calculi (predicate calculus, type theories, etc) in categories.
We know, in particular, that the introduction, elimination, beta
and eta rules for a logical connective correspond to various
features of an adjunction between functors (see S 7.2 of my book).

Now that we have seen this correspondence for numerous logical
operations, we can turn it around: given an adjunction between
functors, we might be able to design a formal calculus that
corresponds to it.

That is what "Subspaces in ASD" does with the monadic property.

It allows one to work in a natural way with the given structure of the
category (in particular N and the lattice Sigma), but then to introduce
Sigma-split subspaces given certain "subspace data" called a NUCLEUS.
This word was appropriated from locale theory because nuclei serve the
same essential purpose in both cases, but the definitions are slightly
different.

It is important to understand that the "subspaces" in this calculus
are not subsets.  Putting this back in categorical language, SS 4--6
of that paper constructs the monadic category by formally adjoining
NEW Sigma-split equalisers.

----

THE EUCLIDEAN & PHOA PRINCIPLES

I want to stick to one categorical idea in this posting, but I should
also point out that the thing that made monadicity look like topology
rather than just category theory or lambda calculus was the Phoa
principle.  The "Frobenius laws" for open and proper maps follow from
this.  (These things are not in "Synthetic Topology" either.)

This says that open and closed subspaces of X are in bijection, not
because of set-theoretic complementation, but because they each
correspond bijectively to maps  X --> Sigma.  Whereas locale theory
has infinite joins but finite meets, and there are double negations
all over the place in intuitionistic analysis,  ASD has a very
strong duality between open and closed ideas.   This is applied
to connectedness and (approximate forms of) the intermediate value
theorem in "Lambda calculus for real analysis".

The "miracle" that led to my working full time on ASD was the
relationship between the Euclidean principle and dominances,
and the fact that overt discrete spaces form a pretopos
(See "Geometric and higher order logic").

---

DIFFICULTIES WITH THE ASD PROGRAMME

I want to cross-examine the charge that I cannot present my own work.

It has turned out that the nucleus that we use to construct R is the
simplest non-trivial example, and the one that is best motivated by
other considerations.  It is a pity that I did not know this ten years
ago, and that I was so reluctant to do real analysis.  Instead, I
spent a lot of time developing more general locally compact spaces,
and also overt discrete ones.  However, the construction of the
Dedekind reals involves topological and combinatorial arguments
that we can now present with confidence ONLY BECAUSE I had previously
done a thorough study of them.

Working with ASD nuclei is extremely difficult.  For each one,
several sections of a paper are needed simply to show that some
bizarre formula satisfies another bizarre equation.  The proofs
are long and intricate because the axioms are very weak and the
techniques are novel.

The reason for this difficulty is that I am working with monads and
Beck's theorem.  Let me point out some history.  Although this result
appears in many textbooks (including mine), Jon Beck never wrote it up
himself.  He might have taught us about non-Abelian cohomology, and
what "exactness" means for general algebras, except that his thesis
advisers told him that homological algebra had to be done with Abelian
groups.  In that subject, there is a black art of finding contraction
maps.  Beautiful though monadic adjunctions are, they don't compose.
Altogether, Beck's theorem was a very awkward beast long before
I had even heard of category theory.

I feel that, with the monadic lambda calculus, I have begun to tame
this beast.  (Moggi's calculus did so too, but that worked with the
Kleisli category, not the Eilenberg--Moore one that is crucial to
Heine--Borel.)  Whereas locale theory, formal topology, topos theory
and algebraic geometry stuck to the abstract algebra, ASD turns it
into topological notation. Constructing new spaces with nuclei may
still be a black art, for the reasons that I have mentioned, but the
continuous functions between them are handled very naturally.

----

BEYOND LOCAL COMPACTNESS

The awkwardness of working with (the monad and) nuclei is directly
related to the difficulty in generalising them beyond locally compact
spaces.  The point is that we want general equalisers and function
spaces
without sacrificing the principle of using the algebra of open
subspaces.

Actually, I have plenty of proposals for more general AXIOMS, and for
theorems that we might prove with them.

The problem with Beck's theorem lies in the restricted form of the
second clause.  There are several interesting cases of monads where
the forgetful functor   U : A=Algebras --> C=Carriers  PRESERVES
ALL REFLEXIVE COEQUALISERS.
  - Pare's theorem, for any topos C;
  - Richard Wood's A=CCD, C=CCC^op;
  - A=Frm, C=Dcpo;
  - C=Set, A= algebras for any single-sorted finitary algebraic theory.

Unfortunately, I have no idea how to construct such a category for
topology in the ASD formulation.  There are plenty of cartesian closed
supercategories of topological spaces, but they are point-based.
Reinhold Heckmann constructed a CCC in which the category of locales
is reflective (MSCS 16 (2006) 231--253), but this relies on the Axiom
of Collection, and I don't think that it yields what I want either.

Another possibility is a sheaf topos over the effective topos, which
provides a model of ASD that has all exponentials and finite limits.
However, whilst it satisfies the Heine--Borel theorem, there will
be higher-type analogues of the failure in recursive analysis.

Maybe we should look for models that just satisfy specific instances
of this property. The underlying principle seems to be this:

    given a parallel pair (u,v) of homomorphisms of algebras
    and a function f with f.u = f.v,

    under what circumstances does f factor through a homomorphism w
    with w.u = w.v?

Heine--Borel, monadicity, injectivity of Sigma, and the Beck--Chevalley
condition for open and proper maps seem to be examples of this
principle.

Can we find models based on traditional topology, locale theory,
formal topology or recursion theory that satisfy it in more cases?

----

CONCLUSION

Synthetic Topology interprets ideas of general topology in cartesian
closed categories and lambda calculus.  Abstract Stone Duality shows
that, in order to make the topology work PROPERLY (with the
Heine--Borel theorem etc), we need to postulate additional higher
type lambda terms associated with subspaces.

I have just stated what I think the challenge is regarding the
construction of more general models.  Separate from this are other
challenges in real analysis and computation.

I have taken the intellectual and personal risks and done much of the
groundwork to demonstrate the viability of ASD as an approach to
constructive topology and analysis.  It seems to me that these
challenges are worthy of the attention of the best categorical minds.
However, it will only be possible to achieve these things if my
colleagues are willing to make a professional study and assessment of
what has already been done in ASD.

Dear all,

Here is a new preprint. Best regards. pg.


Title: Globular realization and cubical underlying homotopy type of time flow
of process algebra

Abstract:  We construct a small realization as flow of every precubical set
  (modeling for example a process algebra). The realization is small
  in the sense that the construction does not make use of any
  cofibrant replacement functor and of any transfinite construction.
  In particular, if the precubical set is finite, then the
  corresponding flow has a finite globular decomposition. Two
  applications are given.  The first one presents a realization
  functor from precubical sets to globular complexes which is
  characterized up to a natural S-homotopy.  The second one proves
  that, for such flows, the underlying homotopy type is naturally
  isomorphic to the homotopy type of the standard cubical complex
  associated with the precubical set.

Dear Jim

The answer is No, I believe, but the only thinking I have
done about the question is as follows.

In his paper on adjoint functors, Kan constructed a
category %A for each category A. He used this to
construct what we now call Kan extensions. It provides
the domain of a diagram whose limit gives the end of
a functor T : A^op x A --> X. At Bowdoin College in 1969,
Mac Lane called %A the Kan subdivision category. It is
a bit like barycentric subdivision in that each arrow f (edge)
of A becomes an object (vertex) [f] of %A; the only non-identity
arrows of %A are formally adjoined as in the situation
[a] --> [f] <-- [b] where f : a --> b and a and b are identified with
their identity arrows. There are not many composable pairs
in %A so it seems that N%A is not the barycenric subdivision
of the nerve of A.

At this point I dug out my old copy of Kan's 1957 paper "On c.s.s.
complexes" on which I scribbled some notes back in the late 1960s.
If S is the category of finite sets and P : S --> Ord is the covariant
powerset functor into ordered sets, we can define a functor
D : S --> Simp into the category of simplicial sets (= css complexes)
by (Ds)_q = Ord([q] , Ps). Kan's functor "Delta prime" is the
restriction
of D to the (topologists') simplicial category. Then Sd : Simp --> Simp
is the extension along the Yoneda embedding of "Delta prime" to a
colimit preserving functor. This yields the formula

	Sd(X)_q  =  coend^[n] X_n x Ord([q] , P[n]),

but I see no way of using this when X is the nerve of a category A.
Maybe there is more chance in the case of groupoids.

(The left adjoint to Sd is Kan's functor Ex which starts a simplicial
set on its way to becoming a Kan complex.)

What made you suspect the existence of such a subdivision of categories?

Cubical cospans and higher cobordisms (Cospans in Algebraic Topology, =20=

Abstract. After two papers on weak cubical categories and collarable =20
cospans, respectively, we put things together and construct a weak =20
cubical category of cubical collared cospans of topological spaces. =20
We also build a second structure, called a quasi cubical category, =20
formed of arbitrary cubical cospans concatenated by homotopy =20
pushouts. This structure, simpler but weaker, has lax identities. It =20
contains a similar framework for cobordisms of manifolds with corners =20=

and could therefore be the basis to extend the study of TQFT's of =20
Part II to higher cubical degree.

Dear all,

Glasgow is just now introducing a Masters-level mathematics programme, and
I'm teaching the Category Theory course.  I'm looking for suggestions on a
particular aspect of teaching it.

It's a question of "size".  Most of the times I've taught category theory
previously were at Cambridge, where the students are exposed to ZFC-style
set theory as undergraduates.  Every year there'd be a few people who'd
really worry about the set-theoretic validity of category theory: "doesn't
Russell's paradox forbid a category of sets?", etc.  I'd tell them,
essentially, not to think about it; one can make a distinction between
"small" and "large" collections, and experience shows that this suffices.
Not a profound answer, but there you are.

At Glasgow I'm going to have the opposite problem.  Undergraduates here do
no set theory of any kind.  So, for instance, there's no reason why they
should have heard of ZFC, or that there are collections "too big to be
sets".  Be careful what you wish for: after years of telling Cambridge
students to forget their set theory, I now have students with no set
theory to forget.  And the question I'm having trouble answering is this:
what do I need to tell them about sets?

I can't tell them nothing, as far as I can see.  For instance, I want them
to know that the category of groups has "all" limits; but of course, Grp
doesn't really have all limits, only small limits, so they'll need to know
what "small" means.  Later, I'll want to teach the Adjoint Functor
Theorems.

A rough and ready solution would be to tell them that there is a
distinction between "small" and "large" collections, otherwise known as
"sets" and "proper classes".  This would necessitate giving them an
example of a large collection, and I guess the obvious choice is the class
in Russell's Paradox.  But then I'd have to tell them that this is exactly
the kind of thing that they shouldn't be thinking about!  It's hardly
satisfactory.

There's probably a better solution involving an axiomatization of the
category of sets (along the lines of the Lawvere-Rosebrugh book), or at
least a listing of some its properties.  I have two difficulties here.
One - which readers of the list may be able to help me with - is that I
haven't figured out how this would work in practice: for instance, how it
would feed into the statement above on the completeness of Grp.  Does
anyone have experience of this?  The other is that I haven't got room to
be too radical, as the syllabus is already set (categories, functors,
transformations; adjunctions, representables, limits; monads and/or
monoidal categories).

In a way this is an ideal situation: a classful of minds innocent of ZFC,
able to come at set theory in a completely fresh way.  I'd very much
appreciate suggestions on how best to use this freedom.

Tom

The question is more when than whether to bring up this distinction.
Although the Lawvere-Rosebrugh book doesn't define "large" it does
define "small relative to Set" in the antepenultimate paragraph of the
book (p.250), namely as "can be parameterized by an object of Set".
Near the midpoint of the book (p.130) is the statement of Cantor's
theorem X < 2^X with the consequence that Set cannot be parameterized by
any of its objects (and hence by the definition on p.250 cannot be small
relative to itself).

In contrast Borceux in his 3-volume series gets the size issue out of
the way on pages 1-4 of Volume 1.  CTWM is in between, addressing it on
p.22 after covering categories, natural transformations, monics, epis,
and zeros.

One benefit of getting the distinction out of the way near the beginning
is that the students won't feel so mystified when they run across it
while reading other category-relevant material (as the better students
will).   The combinatorics of sets (n^m functions from a set of m
elements to a set of n elements, etc., which they definitely should
know) in no way prepares one for the possibility of an object larger
than any set, for which Cantor's theorem is very helpful.

Of the above three positionings, I like CTWM's best: early on, yet not
so early as to exaggerate its importance relative to the fundamental
concepts of CT.

Not to say that CTWM starts out ideally.  Spending three pages defining
"metacategory" and then defining "category" as "any interpretation of
the category axioms within set theory" is impenetrably idiosyncratic for
students used to more conventional introductions in their other pure
maths courses.  Once past the size issue Borceux is much more
conventional and direct, except for the relatively mild criticism that
his definition of "category" is actually the definition of "locally
small category."  But that's not at all the stumbling block to
understanding that "metacategory" presents, in fact if anything it is
helpful not to be distracted at the outset by the prospect of large
homobjects.

While on the topic of size of homobjects, what drawbacks are there to
regarding both the objects and homobjects of any n-category as all lying
within the n-th Grothendieck universe for a suitable hierarchy U_1 < U_2
< ... of such (with U_0 = 1)?  Although admittedly idiosyncratic, it
seems very natural to account for large homobjects in a category C with
the explanation that C is really a 2-category, whether or not one is
making use of the 2-cells.  I can see a methodological objection, namely
that there is no logical connection between size and existence of
n-cells for a given n.  Does it create any actual difficulty somewhere?

Dear Tom,

Here is a rationale for a "cop-out" answer.

When I taught categories at Imperial I had 10 lectures in a Computer
Science department, so there was a limit to what I could do.

For the adjoint functor theorem, I just taught the easy direction -
that a (let's say) left adjoint preserves all colimits that exist.
That's already an extremely useful thing to know. For the converse (a
functor from a cocomplete category is a left adjoint if ...), one can
already prove it for posets as a special case. I didn't go any
further because (a) I didn't have time, and (b) - like you - I didn't
know how to explain the set/class issues. But in retrospect I'm
completely happy with that because the result relies on classical
reasoning principles. In practice there is a lot to be said for
constructing a right adjoint explicitly by other means. Checking that
colimits are preserved then becomes a prudent check before you spend
time looking for an adjoint.

You also mention the issue of the category of groups having "all"
limits. It seems to me that if you show them how infinite products
have the universal property, and how then other limits can be
constructed, then you'll have shown them the main thing they need to
know. I would keep the set/class issue as a secret aside for those
who have seen it before.

Regards,

Steve Vickers.

Sorry for not explaining!  FOLDS is an acronym for First Order Logic=20

Googling the whole phrase does produce satisfying results,=20

Actually, what I find intriguing is that it is the definition of=20
enriched category which seems to have priority over the definition
of internal category.  There are, I suppose, historical reasons for=20
this (pre-1960 the focus tended to be on AbGp-enriched categories)
---but I think it fair to say that (for as long as I can remember,=20
which obviously isn't that long from a "historical" perspective)
the majority of category theorists tend to adopt the internal=20
category style of definition (of category) as more primitive. =20

The issue at stake may seem minor: do we think of a class of arrows=20
(which can later be partitioned into homsets), or do we think of the=20
homsets first (and take their disjoint union later)?  But perhaps=20
the fact that one group of people prefers one approach and everyone
else the other is symptomatic of a psychological divide?=20

It's also worth noting, perhaps, how flukey it is that in the case=20
V=3DSet, V-internal and small V-enriched categories happen to coincide.
Consider V=3DCat, for example.  Or, note how different the requirements=20
on V are, for V-internal and V-enriched categories to be defined.=20

It is true that one would expect set-theoretic conservatives to deal with
small categories (~internal categories in the case V=3DSet), and more fle=
xible
mathematicians to use arbitrary large categories (~internal categories, w=
here=20
V is a category of "large sets", or classes).  This only re-inforces the=20
points made above.

Cheers,
Jeff.
