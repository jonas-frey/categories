Mike Barr reported
	that Adobe Acrobat 8 tacitly suppresses all ligature glyphs of =
the
	fi, fl, ff, ffi, and ffl sort and displays blanks in their place
and then that
	I have to admit that I never tested it, just copied the =
complaint
	from texhax
but nevertheless this presumably gives us some idea why,
	at TAC, we still consider the dvi to be the official format.

However, as I shall demonstrate, the rest of the world nowadays regards
PDF as the standard format in which to publish technical documents.

DVI (the normal output from LaTeX) was based on the 1950s Monotype
typesetting system, and puts characters from various fonts at given
positions on the page, but cannot rotate them, and has no graphics
capability.  The fonts also have to be supplied separately.   On the
other hand, it has the virtues of being a compact and simple format
that future digital archeologists would have no difficulty in
deciphering.

Adobe's PDF and PostScript have general graphics capability.

By insisting on DVI, "Theory and Applications of Categories" severely
limits the ways in which authors can express their mathematical ideas.
But its restrictions go further than this:  the use of ANY macro package
other than those by Mike Barr and Kris Rose is forbidden!



Does anyone know of another journal that publishes primarily in DVI?

One candidate might be the journal of the TeX Users' Group,
	tug.org/TUGboat
but even that uses PDF.   When I enquired about this, Karl Berry (who
also wrote the Web2C Unix implementation of TeX) replied that
	DVI files are not self-contained, so they simply don't work
	for online archives.

Turning to other respositories, arXiv.org generates papers in various
formats on-the-fly.  On its page for each paper, eg
	arxiv.org/abs/math/0512110
it offers PostScript and PDF, with other options (including DVI) only
being available via another link.

On my own web site,
	www.PaulTaylor.EU
I also offer my papers in various formats, albeit statically, with DVI
listed first.  However, the downloads in September and October were
	DVI: 210     PDF: 1704     PS.GZ: 75     BKLT.GZ: 52
This includes 504 PDF and 69 other downloads of "Proofs and Types", but
excludes the lecture slides and scanned manuscripts that I only offer
in PDF.  So, 85% of my readers choose PDF,  even though I also offer=20
DVI.

Looking at my colleagues' web pages, my impression is that most of them
ONLY offer their papers in PDF nowadays.   I can't give authoritative
figures for this, as Hypatia has been dead for seven years.  Papers that
people send me as attachments to read or referee generally come in PDF=20=

too.

Even TAC has published a number of papers that it only offers in PS or
PDF. Maybe Bob Rosebrugh could tell us how many downloads there have
been in the various formats from the main TAC web site at MTA.



Turning to software, although PDF legally belongs to Adobe, I really
don't care about bugs in their programs, as I never use them.   For me
and anyone else who writes in LaTeX,  PDF is de facto the language that
is output by pdflatex and input by xpdf and ghostview (gv).   It is a
well documented open format, as Peter Selinger and Andrej Bauer have
pointed out, citing
	www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html
and	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format
See	www.PaulTaylor.EU/technote.html
for brief explanations and links to further information.

When using my Mac OSX laptop, I use the program (Preview) that came with
it to read PDF files.   This also understands several other file=20
formats,
but not DVI.

When I run "latex" in the current tetex distribution of the TeX system,
it actually invokes pdftex (the version of TeX that was modified by
Jir=F5 Zlatuska to generate PDF instead of DVI) with \pdfoutput=3D0.

Google indexes various other formats of web pages besides HTML,
	www.google.com/help/faq_filetypes.html
including PDF and several versions of MicroS**t W*rd, but not DVI.



Returning to TAC,  I quote from its  "Author Information" at
	tac.mta.ca/tac/authinfo.html

	An article must be submitted as a single source file.
	All macros must be included at the beginning of the file.
	Any macro that is not actually used should be deleted from
	the source file.

	The only exception is diagram macro packages. The currently
	acceptable diagram macro packages are those authored by Barr
	and Rose and Moore(Xy-pic). Recall however that authors are
	expected to provide source code which produces usable .dvi
	from these packages (see Note 4 above). Do not rely on .ps
	options. The author is responsible to ensure that the current
	version of a macro package has been used.

Leaving the DVI/PS/PDF issue aside, why is it necessary for articles
to be submitted as single source files?   According to Mike Barr, in
an email to me dated 10 July 2002,
	our rule is, no inclusions, with the following exceptions:
	diagram packages, including yours, and packages that are part of
	standard distributions.  This is so that we can store each paper
	in a single file, without a growing (and essentially =
unidentifiable)
	directory of inclusions.

Now it has been customary for as long as I have had anything to do with
computers that software (by which I mean both programs and papers in=20
this
context) is developed in modular parts, divided into several files but
collected in a directory or folder.  In particular,  programming with
macros should be separate from writing text about mathematics.  Indeed,
the design of LaTeX2e presupposes this in its facility for passing
options to macro packages via
	\usepackage[options]{package}
Has Mike Barr not heard of sub-directories, or of tar-archives?
Why does he create so much inconvenience for TAC authors for such
a trivial benefit to himself?

Notice, in particular, that my diagrams package was approved for use
in TAC in 2002, but is now forbidden.   Is this perhaps because Mike
disgrees with me over DVI?

The design decision to use PostScript inclusions to rotate diagonal
arrows in my package was made in 1992,  in consultation with users.
Neither Mike nor Bob nor anyone else at the time argued against that
decision, whilst several people said it was a good idea.  The package
web page,
	www.PaulTaylor.EU/diagrams
explains the background to this decision,  and also how to make half-
decent diagrams using the UglyObsolete pre-1992 code if you REALLY
need to use pure DVI.    I would strongly request that anyone who uses
my package, or  who wishes to reply to my comments here, should READ
this web page first.=09

TAC began two or three years AFTER this decision was made,  but Mike
and Bob did not discuss their pure DVI policy with me.   If they had
done so, we might have been able to lobby the maintainers of DVI
programs (such as Paul Vojta of XDVI) to add support for rotation,
or they might have persuaded me to improve the old DVI code in my
package.  The time for doing either of these things has now long past.

In his email of 23 January 1990 to me and 24 other people that resulted
in the establishment of the "categories" forum and subsequently the TAC
journal,  Bob Rosebrugh said
	it seems clear (maybe only to me) that a TeX-based journal is
	a starting point.  My guess is that LaTeX together with some
	version of Mike's macros should be the starting standard.
It would appear that they are still trying to impose this standard.

There are plenty of people who regard MY package as the standard.  For
example, I recently heard from a blind mathematician who "draws"=20
diagrams
by dictating the input language of my package to his wife,
	lalitalarking.blogspot.com/2007/09/great-dictator.html


In conclusion,  I call upon Mike, Bob and the Editorial and Advisory
Committees of TAC to come out of the 1980s, and support the production=20=

of
papers using the modern typographical software that other journals use.

This is to invoke a limit on the current categories discussion of document
display formats to the next 48 hours. Paul's post redirects the discussion
towards indirectly categorical relevance, but there are other forums where
such matters are not peripheral.

A brief comment on the Triassic tendencies of TAC and its editors will
follow.

Many electronic journals in mathematics post dvi files. Like TAC, most
of these post, and also archive, all of dvi, ps and pdf.

TAC's policy on dvi has evolved since 1995. That policy will continue to
change, no doubt at a slower rate than some would wish. None of us knows
what the digital world will look like in 10 years, but careful choices
made for TAC over a dozen years ago have been validated.

Inevitably nowadays, most of the web traffic on sites like TAC's is for
caching, so such figures for any TAC site mean nothing. If Paul's counts
record human usage, then what is surprising is how many of the downloads
were *not* pdf.

...

This request (for a single source file) is seen as, at worst, a trivial
inconvenience by most authors, and it simplifies the lives of editors who
volunteer their time and knowledge.

Note that TAC's submission requirements for authors describe what we would
like to see. Sometimes we don't. We are grateful on the many occasions
when authors comply. In practice, TAC editors are flexible and are working
with authors who gladly cooperate in publishing a visually pleasing
article. We much prefer diagrams based on xypic, but a glance at recent
numbers shows that leeway is available.

...

> It would appear that they are still trying to impose this standard.

Paul has made a heroic search for a conspiracy, but, alas, has not found
one. I don't particularly remember writing the sentence he quotes from
early 1990, and hadn't heard of his diagram package back then. My 1990
suggestion was not motivated by an intention to exclude him 15 years
later. The misperception of malice is regretted.

In the frame of the extended EU FP6-funded TYPES project, we are
organizing an ad hoc "small workshop" on integration of effects into
type-theoretic programming/reasoning.

This is an informal event and attendance is not confined to people
involved in TYPES. On the contrary, attendance and contributions from
outside the TYPES consortium are most welcome. The invited speakers
are Paul Levy and Aleksandar Nanevski.

              Call for contibutions and participation

            Workshop on Effects and Type Theory,  EffTT
               Tallinn, Estonia, 13-14 December 2007

                       http://cs.ioc.ee/efftt/

              a "small workshop" of the TYPES project


Background

The syntax and semantics of impurities of computation known as effects
have been an important challenge for functional programming. Today, we
tend to employ categorically inspired tools such as monads, Lavwere
theories and arrows, but also more pragmatic approaches such as
uniqueness typing.

Effects are an issue also for type-theoretic programming and
reasoning, where a number of aspects make them specifically
interesting. First, we do not yet know what the best dependently typed
generalizations of our simply typed tools are, although we hope they
would reinforce the dual utility of type-theoretic calculi as
programming languages and logics. Second, this duality specifically
forces that pure computations must terminate, so even nontermination
is an impurity and potentially an effect. Third, is it not likely that
the type-theoretic glasses can help us see more clearly the
particularities of external-world effects such as true destructively
updatable state and true interactive input-output?

Thus, this workshop is exactly about effects and type theory. Topics
of interest include

    * all kinds of dependent generalizations of monads and more
    * type-theoretic language design for effects
    * type-theoretic effectful programming methodology
    * time, nontermination and type theory
    * state and type theory,
           including combinations of Hoare-like logics and type theory
    * interactive input-output and type theory
    * theories of external-world effects
    * type theory and concurrency
    * type-theoretic descriptions of physical systems
    * and any further topics about effects and type theory

Invited speakers

Our invited speakers are Paul Levy (Birmingham) and Aleksandar
Nanevski (Microsoft Research, Cambridge).


Contributing a talk

The rest of the programme will be based on contributed talks and
discussions. If you would like to contribute a talk, send a title and
abstract to efftt(at)cs.ioc.ee by 21 November 2007.


Organizers

The workshop organizers are Thorsten Altenkirch, Marino Miculan and
Tarmo Uustalu.


Venue

The workshop will take place in the building of the Estonian Academy
of Sciences on Tallinn's Dome Hill.

The workshop dates are during the Tallinn Christmas market and the
Christmas Jazz festival of Jazzkaar.


Participating

To register, please drop an email to efftt(at)cs.ioc.ee as soon as
possible, but not later than 21 November 2007.

Attendance is not confined to people involved in the TYPES project;
the workshop is open to anyone interested.

9th International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science
                http://www.cwi.nl/projects/cmcs08/
                         Budapest, Hungary
                          April 4-6, 2008

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 11th European Joint
     Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software ETAPS 2008
                        March 29 - April 6, 2008

Aims and Scope

During the last few years, it has become increasingly clear that a
great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition
systems, automata, process calculi and class-based systems, can be
captured uniformly as coalgebras.  Coalgebra is developing into a
field of its own interest presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a
growing field of applications and interactions with various other
fields such as reactive and interactive system theory, object oriented
and concurrent programming, formal system specification, modal logic,
dynamical systems, control systems, category theory, algebra,
and analysis. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its
applications.



The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

      the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and
          categorical approaches);
      coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for
          programming languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
      coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
      coalgebras and data types;
      coinductive definition and proof principles for coalgebras
          (with bisimulations or invariants);
      probabilistic systems as coalgebras;
      algebras versus coalgebras;
      coalgebraic specification and verification;
      coalgebras and (modal) logic;
      game theory in coalgebra;
      coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and
           hybrid systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, Genova, Grenoble, Warsaw, Barcelona and Vienna. The
proceedings appeared as Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer
Science (ENTCS) Volumes 11,19, 33, 41, 65.1, 82.1, 106 and 164.1.
You can get an idea of the types of papers presented at the meeting
by looking at the tables of contents of the ENTCS volumes
from those workshops.


Location

CMCS 2008 will be held in Budapest on April 4-6, 2008. It will be a
satellite workshop of ETAPS 2008, the European Joint Conferences on
Theory and Practice of Software.


Programme Committee

Jiri Adamek (chair, Braunschweig),
Corina Cirstea (Southampton),
Neil Ghani (Nottingham),
H. Peter Gumm (Marburg),

Submissions

Two sorts of submissions will be possible this year:

Papers to be evaluated by the programme committee for inclusion in the
ENTCS proceedings:

These papers must be written using ENTCS style files and be of length
no greater than 20 pages. They must contain original contributions, be
clearly written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison
with related work. If a submission describes software, software tools,
or their use, it should include all source code that is needed to
reproduce the results but is not publicly available. If the additional
material exceeds 5 MB, URL's of publicly available sites should be
provided in the paper.

Short contributions:

These will not be published but will be compiled into a technical
report of the Technical University of Braunschweig. They should be
no more than two pages and may describe work in progress, summarise
work submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere, or in some
other way appeal to the CMCS audience.

Both sorts of submission should be submitted in postscript or pdf form
as attachments to an email to cmcs08@cwi.nl.  The email should
include the title, corresponding author, and, for the first kind of
submission, a text-only one-page abstract.

After the workshop, we expect to produce a journal proceedings of
extended versions of selected papers to appear in Theoretical
Computer Science.


Important Dates

 Deadline for submission of regular papers:     January 13, 2008.
 Notification of acceptance of regular papers:  February 11, 2008.
 Final version for the preliminary proceedings: February 18, 2008.

 Deadline for submission of short contributions:      March 10, 2008.
 Notification of acceptance of short contributions:   March 17, 2008.

Dear Uwe
You are right in thinking that there should be such=20
an exposition because the construction is explicitly=20
or implicitly involved in so many contexts that a=20
formal summary would be useful. Unfortunately,=20
I know of no such exposition though Hugo Volger=20
started one many years ago.

As you can see from the TAC Reprint of my=20
thesis, the original motivation was to=20
be able to state the definition of adjointness in a=20
wholly elementary way for arbitrary categories=20
without involving enrichments in some fixed
category of sets. If A is a reflective subcategory in=20
some X and if B is coreflective in the same X, then=20
composing the implicit functors yields an adjoint=20
pair between A and B. The point is that conversely=20
any adjoint pair can be so factored through a third=20
"adjunction" category X and the universally available=20
choice has this simple construction as a pullback.
It proved to be the appropriate tool for calculating
Kan extensions, adequacy comonads, fibrations,etc.
Grothendieck defined slice categories and Artin the=20
gluing, both of which are special cases of this
construction.

Although inserters are interdefinable (like equalizers
vs pullbacks), some consider inserters more basic:=20
given x:A->C and y:B->C, one can take the=20
inserter of the two composites AxB->C to obtain=20
the construction under discussion.=20

In the special case A=3DB=3D1 (when the inserter and the=20
"comma" category are the same) we obtain the homset=20
(x,y) of two objects of C. The latter was the reason=20
for my notation: it generalizes a frequent notation for=20
hom.[Recall that every object belongs to a unique=20
category; thus the standard notation C(x,y) is
actually redundant (if C is not enriched), though easier
to understand. Either notation is preferable to the=20
excessive HomsubC, a back formation not be confused
with the informative HomsubR when C arises from=20
adjoining some additional structure R to a given base.]
=20
Concerning the bizarre name:
(1) I had neglected to give the construction any name,=20
so (2) one started giving it a name based on reading=20
aloud the notation: x comma y; (3) some continued
the "name" but changed the notation to a vertical arrow.

Since it is well justified to name a category for its=20
objects, and since the effect of insertion is to create=20
objects with one ingredient more of structure, recent=20
discussions here have proposed the name/notation
             Map(x,y)
[or for emphasis Map(subC)(x,y)]
for the category with its faithful functor to AxB.

Although I often use the word "map" interchangeably
with "morphism", note that the above suggests a more
concrete content: philosophically, in order to confront=20
objects in two categories A and B, it is necessary to=20
first functorially transport them into a common=20
category C. For example to map a 2-truncated simplicial=20
set to a diffentiable manifold (such as a piece of
paper) one first interprets each in appropriate ways as=20
topological spaces, and the resulting objects form a=20
category (having full subcategories of "cartographical"=20
interest). =20

I would be happy to offer a prize for the best exposition!

Andre Joyal defined derivatives of analytic functors
in his 1986 paper. Recently I heard the more general definition
of a derivative F' of an endofunctor F defined via a universal
sub-cartesian transformation from F'xId into F. Who is the author
of this definition? The following result seems to indicate that
outside of the realm of analytic functors derivatives may not
be really useful:

Theorem. Every non-faithful functor F:Set -> Set has the derivative
         F' = 0 (the constant functor to the empty set).

Dear colleagues,

I hope someone, and in particular Prof. Peter Johnstone, will help me
with the following information. I thought I had, with Jacques
Roubaud, proved in our joint note at the "Comptes Rendus" which I
mentioned in my previous mail proved a theorem on Monads and Descent.
I must have been mistaken, and also the many persons who quoted this
note, because in El Proposition 1.5.5 is the same theorem, but
attributed to J. Beck.

I immediately "rushed" to the monumental bibliography of El to find
the reference, and there, big surprise, there was no J. Beck at all
among the 1262 references.

Thus i'd greatly appreciate to have the date and paper of the paper
where Beck proved this theorem, and the precise statement he made, in
particular, did he prove his theorem in the general context of
fibered or indexed categories, or only in some very special case.

Many thanks for your help

History can be harder than mathematics. Yet, it is a worthy goal to get it
right. This can require discussion and feedback. Here are some of my
memories which I am quite happy for people to correct if they have a
fuller picture.

Jean Benabou invented bicategories. In SLNM47 you will find
the particular example of a bicategory Spn(E) whose morphisms
are spans in a pullback-complete category E. You will also find the
convention to refer to properties holding in the homs as local. I always
thought it nice that the homs in Spn(E) were slice categories
E / a x b, thereby unifying two uses of "local".

You will also find in that SLNM47 paper, the notion of morphism of
bicategories and of homomorphism of bicategory. These a very useful
concepts. They do compose in their own way. I believe there was no
attempt to deny that the "indexed categories" of Pare-Schumacher
are category-valued homomorphisms.

The 1969-70 academic year at Tulane University Math Dept was dedicated to
Category Theory. Jack Duskin and I were there (doing some teaching as well
as research) for the whole year. Saunders Mac Lane and Eduardo Dubuc were
there for the first semester. Bernhard Banaschewski and Z.  Hedrln were
there for the second semester. However, we had a lot of visitors as well.
In particular, Jean Benabou visited sometime in the first semester.  In
particular, I learnt from Benabou's lectures about the "Chevalley
condition" for fibrations and how descent data were Eilenberg-Moore
algebras. Jean gave me a copy of his Comptes Rendu article with Jacques
Roubaud.

Very soon after Jean Benabou left, Jon Beck arrived. He asked me what the
various visitors had talked about. When I told him about Benabou's lecture
on descent, he said that that was what he had planned to talk about
("triples" and descent). I encouraged him to do so but he decided to
change his topic. His topic by the way was also very interesting: using
monads -- sorry, triples -- in homotopy theory and categorical coherence.
This was before operads!

I wondered what would happen to Beck's work on descent. Category theorists
were not prolific publishers. Then I found reference to the "Beck
condition" in Bill Lawvere's papers of the time: it was what Benabou had
called the "Chevalley condition". So, when I had need for a 2-categorical
version of this involving comma objects instead of pullbacks, I called it
the "Beck-Chevalley condition". This 2-categorical version expresses
pointwiseness of Kan extensions and embodies Lawvere's formula for such
extensions.

Also by the way, Lawvere's comma categories are generalized slice
constructions so I proposed (not really wishing to introduce new notation
but somewhat worried about using (f, g) as more than just the pair) using
f/g for functors f and g into the same category.

Now, as much as I would love SIX bottles of GOOD champagne, I am not going
to submit a suggestion for Jean's challenge. Composition of fibrations is
a wonderful thing as is composition of homomorphisms of bicategories; but
they do different jobs. It is hard enough to say fibrations are composable
from the homomorphism viewpoint!

There is a thing about this that requires a mixture of the two views.
Regard one fibration p : E --> A as a homomorphism E_ : A --> Cat. Keep
the other q : A -- > B as a fibration. Then the homomorphism corresponding
to the composite q p is a generalized left Kan extension of E_ along q.

Ross

I certainly heard Jon lecture on this a number of times.  PUblication?
Lot's of luck.  A quick glance at MathSciNet shows that there are an awful
lot of J. Beck's, at least one J.M. Beck and at least one Jonathan Beck,
but no paper by our Jon Beck on descent theory.  As for precise statement,
don't even think about it.  But my recollection was only whether a triple
could descend across a functor.  There were cocyle conditions that were
necessary and sufficient.  I think the "Beck-Chevalley condition" was a
simple example.

At one point, Jon told my wife with some regret that, thanks to my
insistence, he was finally published.  He seemed constitutionally
incapable of putting his thoughts in public.

I think you can suppose that if PTJ couldn't find it, it isn't there
except in the (increasingly feeble) memories of those who heard him.

Dear Jean,

There is an unpublished (untitled and undated) four-pages manuscript which
John Beck gave to me (and I supposed also to many ohers) when he was at
McGill. In it, he states and proves two theorems, the CTT (crude
tripleableness theorem), and the PTT (precise tripleableness theorem). There
is a connection between triples and descent implicit in the PTT. But this is
not the same connection with descent as the Benabou-Roubaud theorem.

The following remarks seem to be relevant to this issue.

In M. Bunge and R. Pare, "Stacks and equivalece of indexed categories",
Cahiers de Topologie et Geometrie Differentielle, vol XX-4 (1979) 373-399,
we state and prove the following version of the Benabou-Roubaud theorem
(which we quote):

Proposition 2.3. (Benabou and Roubaud [10]). let A be an S-indexed category
(S is a topos) for
which Sigma (or Pi) exists and satisfies the Beck condition. Then A is a
stack iff for every regular epi alpha:J--->>I in S, the functor alpha^*: A^I
---> A^J is tripleable (resp. cotripleable).

What Bob Pare and I called "the Beck condition" above is the "Chevalley
property" introduced in your paper. The proof of the Benabou-Roubaud theorem
was not given in your Comptes Rendues note, and this is why we gave an
explicit proof of it, since we needed to apply it to stacks. Indeed, from
the Benabou-Roubaud theorem, using in addition the Beck's tripleableness
theorem, one can obtain applications showing that a certain S-indexed
category A is a stack. In Bunge-Pare, we obtain in this way, using Duskin's
version of the tripleability theorem (J. Duskin, "Variations on Beck's
tripleability criterion", Reports of the Midwest Categories Seminar III, LNM
106, Springer, 1969), the following (actually we give it a more generality):

Corollary 2.5. Any topos S, indexed by itself in the usual way, is a stack.

In turn, this is used in my sequel paper (M. Bunge,Stack completions and
Morita equivalence for categories in a topos", Cahiers de Top. et Geo. Diff.
XX-4 (1979) 401-436), using closure properties of stacks, to
identify/construct stack completions of category objects in S.

It seems then to be an error on the part of Peter Johnstone to have
attributed Proposition 1.5.5 in E1 (page 297) to Beck and not to Benabou and
Roubaud. At the end of this section on "Descent Conditions and Stacks" (page
303), the references given in El 1 are Bourn, Bunge and Pare, Giraud,
Grothendieck, Reiterman and Tholen, but curiously enough, not
Benabou-Roubaud. I am sure that Peter will repair this error should a second
edition of the Elephant ever appear. I would like to add that people who
write such monumental works are bound to make errors of this sort,
particularly in this case, as the manuscript was not (to my knowledge)
distributed around to the topos theorists and other mathematicians for
comments and criticism prior to publication.

With best regards,
Marta

Concerning Ross Street's interesting remarks about history,
I should clarify where the term "Beck condition" comes from.

I would like to urge the readers of our categories
list to study Jon's 1967 thesis which is now available
via TAC Reprints. There one finds Jon's
tripleability theorems which were used for example by
Benabou and Roubaud in their 1970 paper on descent.

Ross remembers that Jon arrived in Tulane in 1969 prepared to
lecture on triples and descent. I heard Jon lecturing on that topic
already in late 1967 at a meeting of the American Mathematical
Society in Illinois. In particular, he explicitly stated the
condition that I therefore called the "Beck condition" in my
work on Hyperdoctrines (presented to an AMS meeting in NYC
in early 1968).

Later I saw this condition referred to as the Chevalley condition in a
paper of J-L Verdier. I do not know whether Jon was familiar
with that work of Chevalley.

Some sort of "coequalizer in the base implies descent" property on a
fibration F is of course true (in addition to F(X+Y) = F(X) x F(Y))
for those fibrations that exemplify a reasonable notion F of
parameterized family. Tripleability provides a useful
tool for analyzing these descents, but which are the tripleable (monadic)
functors that could arise from descent in some fibration?

Dear Michael,

Thank you for your "trying" to answer. I have waited for a few days
for a "real" answer from Peter Johnstone  to whom my question was,
for obvious reasons, primarily addressed.

When my mail to you was completed I received  a very complete and
nice answer from Ross Street, and then, two more by Marta Bunge. I
want to thank them, and tell them that I shall try to give, in
detail, complete answers to their mails.That is, if the "higher
authorities" who control this list consider that this "mathematico-
historical" disicussion could be as important as, say, the more than
20 mails devoted to the over all important discussion about role
versus r\ole. I shall wait a week before answering Ross and Marta, in
case I get more answers, and, who knows, one can always dream, one by
"Peter Johnstone himself".

I shall make do with your answer, but before I make a few comments
about it, in order for you to understand them, it would be better to
read carefully my comments on the "non-answer" by Johnstone to a
question which concerned his book;

After all "he" was responsible for not mentioning a 1970 "Comptes
Rendus" note, very frequently referred to, and attributing the result
to John Beck, without any reference to a published, or unpublished,
paper of his. Not even to a paper of another author, dating of before
1970, and crediting John Beck with precisely, I insist on it, the
same theorem that was given in my joint note with Roubaud, and which
is attributed to Beck in "The Elephant"!
He is no "baby in the woods", and if he writes something in an
important book, published by Oxford University Press, he must be able
to explain his decision.

I hope to hear from him soon, and; since I am on this unpleasant
matter, I hope he shall also answer the following questions:

(i) In the long Appendix of his Topos Theory (TT), there is only one
theorem.It is due to a student of mine, Jean Celeyrette, whose thesis
is mentioned in the bibliography of (TT). Why has the name of
J.Geleyrette totally  disappeared from the much much longer
bibliography of (El)?

(ii) Same question about my Louvain paper on "Distributors" or
"Profunctors", which he uses in an essential manner in (El) without
ever mentioning my name. It was also  in the bibligraphy of (TT) and
again absent from the bibliography of (El)

With the note on descent, and many other examples, this is getting to
be "a habit" with  Peter Johnstone. I advise him to lose very quickly
such habits, they might become dangerous for one's health.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Considering what I said about Johnstone, you won't be surprised if I
tell you that your answer does not fully satisfy me (and that is an
understatement)
Since oblique, bold, etc fonts are not accepted in this list, I shall
write between quotation marks any parts of your mail I want to
comment upon, and without quotation  marks my comments.

(i)  "I certainly heard Jon lecture on this a number of times"
What does your "this" precisely refer to?

(ii) " PUblication? Lot's of luck.  A quick glance at MathSciNet
shows that there are an awful lot of J. Beck's, at least one J.M.
Beck and at least one Jonathan Beck, but no paper by our Jon Beck on
descent theory. As for precise statement, don't even think about it".

I cannot, and will not, take this for an answer. My joint theorem
with Roubaud is a precise statement, and so is its reformulation by
Johnstone. He was obviously too young in 1970 to have heard it, if
was the same, directly from Beck. How can he be sure it was the same,
if you are not? Moreover I am vain enough to consider it was an
important result, because it established a connection between two
important theories, namely: descent and triples. There were enough
good mathematicians in North America in the late 60's, and certainly,
at least one of them, would have grasped its importance, and given
one, or many, applications, as we did, Roubaud and myself, in the
same note where we stated the theorem. Where are these applications?

(iii)  "But my recollection was only whether a triple could descend
across a functor.  There were cocyle conditions that were necessary
and sufficient.  I think the "Beck-Chevalley condition" was a simple
example"

I do not merely "think", I am sure, that I learnt Chevalley's
condition, from Chevalley, in 1964. At that time fibered categories,
"invented" by Grothendieck, were almost "unheard of" in the "North
American" category community. The first reference I know of is Gray's
paper in the 1965 conference of La Jolla, where he refers to
Chevalley's lost notes for 1962 lectures at Berkeley. Even now, they
are often presented in terms of "indexed categories", under the
influence of W.V. Lawvere's 1971 "Perugia Notes".  I thus doubt very
much that, whatever Beck's talent,in 1964, when his PhD thesis was
not yet completed, he might have had anything like Chevalley's
condition for arbitrary fibrations.
I "think" I was wrong to "compromise" and to accept that what I
called the Chevalley Condifion should have Beck's name assocoated to
it, and I'm sure that, from now on, I shall call Chevalley condition
what was up to now called Beck-Chevalley condition, only because I
insisted that it was historically a nonsense to call it, as the North
American school did, "Beck" condition !


(iii) "At one point, Jon told my wife with some regret that, thanks
to my insistence, he was finally published.  He seemed
constitutionally incapable of putting his thoughts in public."

When and where was he "finally published"?

(iv) "I think you can suppose that if PTJ couldn't find it, it isn't
there except in the (increasingly feeble) memories of those who heard
him."

I do not merely "think", I know that you are a mathematician, (and
that of course for me means a good one). Thus, if Beck's formulation
had been so blatantly simple and precise as mine and Roubaud's you
wouldn't need an effort of memory to remember it, with precision. And
this is of course also true for many of the mathematicians "who heard
him". Although I was not among the happy few who heard him, I don't
need a great effort of memory to remember Beck' Triplability Theorem.

I "think" also that Johnstone had better find a more credible
justification than mere "hear so" and "think that", Jean Benabou, out
of solidarity with the so-called "category-community" might not, even
if he is angry, rise such a fuss. But Jacques Roubaud has no such
solidarity, is very angry, and he is known, and respected, in
"circles" much wider that the few handful of persons that some of us
tend to "think of" as the center of the world.

I do not "think", we are the center of the world, I am even sure, we
are not !

I intend in due course to reply to the long message posted by Jean Benabou
on 30 October. Unfortunately I am very busy at present (I am lecturing
six days a week this term) and I shall not have time to do so for a while.

However, Jean's evident desire for a quick response from me on the
subject of Proposition B1.5.5 in the Elephant cannot be ignored. Since I
wasn't around at the time this result was first proved, I had to rely
on the recollections of those older than myself as to its provenance:
I am grateful to Ross Street and Bill Lawvere for their recent postings
confirming the impression I received many years ago that Jon Beck had
indeed had this idea in the late 1960s. It seems clear from their
accounts that Beck had the idea independently of Benabou and Roubaud;
which of them had it first seems impossible to establish at this stage.

Since their work was independent, I should of course have credited
Benabou--Roubaud as well as Beck at this point in the text of the
Elephant, and I apologize for not having done so. The reason, I must
confess, was that I had simply not come across the Benabou--Roubaud
paper; clearly, this was a failure of due diligence on my part.

Incidentally, in reply to a comment in Marta Bunge's posting, I did
distribute draft copies of the Elephant to a number of colleagues, and
invite their comments, before it was published. None of them picked up
this particular point -- though I am not blaming them for that; the
fault was of course mine.

Regarding the fact that Celeyrette's thesis, and Jean's Louvain notes on
"Les Distributeurs", are not in the bibliography of the Elephant, there
is a simple reason for this: I decided at an early stage that, in order to
keep the size of the bibliography within bounds, it was necessary to limit
it to published books and papers, and to exclude unpublished theses and
other articles circulated only in preprint form. (Hence also the absence
of Beck from the bibliography.) I did relent in one or two cases
(actually as a result of comments from one of the people who saw the
drafts before publication) where a result appearing in someone's thesis,
and not subsequently published, was specifically referred to in the text.

Peter Johnstone

I have now read in the Preface to the Elephant that you did indeed circulate
a draft to "a number of colleagues (including Ieke Moerdijk and Andrew
Pitts, as well as Martin Hyland, Anders Kock and Gavin Wraith) for their
comments and suggestions".

Apologies for my swift comment. I had gotten a different impression from the
reaction of several participants to the Fields Institute Workshop on Galois
Theory etc, where the first two volumes of the Elephant were exhibited,
including comments by Bill Lawvere and several other people whose work was
prominently represented in the book.

Aurelio Carboni and I perused quickly section B4.5 on the symmetric monad,
and were satisfied on the spot with your account of it, but it did not occur
to me to look up section B1.5, even though my paper with Bob Pare on stacks
was cited at the end of the section. Had I done so, I would have pointed out
that Proposition 1.5.5 is due to Benabou and Roubaud as we ourselves had
pointed out in our paper.

I take this opportunity to apologize to Jean Benabou for stating his theorem
with Jacques Roubaud in the context of indexed categories and not on that of
(bi)fibrations without warning the reader, but I also want to point out
that, since the proof  itself only refers to two fibers and a transition map
between them, it is equally meaningful in both contexts. I believe that I
only became aware of the gross difference afterwards, when lecturing on
stack completions at the Benabou Seminar in Paris (whenever that was --
1979?). I still think now that it is easier to work with the indexed
presentations of fibrations than with the fibrations themselves, without
attempting to turn this into a philosophical statement of any kind.

Beck's Tripleability theorem is indeed useful in the applications of the
Benabou-Roubaud theorem, and among them are those we give in the Cahiers
paper on stacks, and in its sequel by myself on stack completions.

Perhaps the relabelling of the Chevalley condition as "the Beck condition"
led to some confusion as to whether the Benabou-Roubaud theorem had been
proved (also) by Jon Beck? I myself never heard him speaking on this, and
never saw any draft written by him of a proof of this theorem. Sadly, we
cannot consult Jon himself on this issue, so we might as well drop it.

Perhaps you would consider, prior to publication of Volume III of the
Elephant, enlarging your list of commentators to include at least those
whose work you include in some form or other.

With best regards,
Marta

The following facts about slice categories may be
worth noticing:

1 In the equivalence between df/X (discrete fibrations
over a category X) and presheaves on X, the slices X/x
-> X correspond to the representable presheaves.

2. (Yoneda Lemma) The reflection of x:1->X (as an
object of Cat/X) in df/X is (isomorphic to) X/x (with
its terminal object as reflection map).
In particular, the full subcategory sl/X of df/X
generated by the slices over X is isomorphic to X.

3. For any functor p:P->X, a morphism p->X/x in Cat/X
is a cone of base p and vertex x.

4. So, a reflection of p->X/x of p in sl/X is a
colimiting cone.

5. A functor f:X->Y has a right adjoint iff the
pullback f*Y/y of any slice of Y is (isomorphic to) a
slice of X.

6. If ex_f -| f* : df/Y -> df/X is the "left Kan
extension" along f, then the counit=20
e: ex_f f* Y/y -> Y/y=20
is an iso for any y iff f is "dense" (aka "connected")
while it is a colimiting cone for any y iff f is
"adequate" (aka "dense").
Using instead the adjunction=20
f_! -| f* : Cat/Y -> Cat/X
the counit is a colimiting cone for any y iff f is
adequate (as before), while it is an absolute colimit
iff f is dense.

Best regards.

Claudio

Dear Categories,

You may find it interesting that a particular case of the condition (in
the particular context of hyperdoctrines-as-logical-theories) was
formulated by Paul Halmos in his Algebraic Logic  (1962). Halmos
considered trivial algebraic theories with variables as the only
terms and their substitutions as morphisms. A direct comparison is not
straightforward because Halmos' formulation was for FOL without equality.
 Yet with the help of Robert Seely's paper "Hyperdoctrines, natural
deduction and the Beck condition" (1983), one can find what
part/form of the condition was stated by Halmos.

Dear colleagues,

You can find in the following site
http://www.math.mcgill.ca/bunge/abstracts.ps
the abstracts of the Oberwolfach Meeting on Descent from 1995.

Look in particular at the abstract for Jack Duskin's lecture on "Triples and
Descent". In it, Jack gives as a corollary to the main theorem what he calls
"the Benabou-Roubaud-Beck theorem". Jack mentions that the theorems exposed
in that lecture were part of a thesis project of his student M. Alsani.

There seems to be a precedent in print then in adding Beck's name to this
theorem, unlike what I previously thought.  Other authors (like Claudio
Hermida) refer to it as "the Beck-Benabou-Roubaud theorem". This, added to
the recollections by Ross Street and Bill Lawvere, seem to contradict my
previous contention (from lack of evidence) that the theorem is exclusively
due to Benabou and Roubaud. It seems now clear that Jon Beck must have had
it (independently) too, which of course is not at all surprising.


With best wishes,
Marta

In the Bulletin of the AMS Volume 74 (1968) page 91 one sees that
a meeting of the Society was held on Saturday November 25th, 1967
at the University of Illinois in Urbana, with over 200 people
attending. There was a session of selected 20-Minute papers on
Categorical Algebra, arranged by Professor Saunders Mac Lane.
Papers by Barr, Beck, Gray, Lawvere, Linton were included.

The abstracts for the talks at that meeting were published in the
Notices of the AMS Volume 14 (1967). On page 938 one finds
Jon Beck's abstract:

      652-8. Jon Beck, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. Descent and
      standard constructions (triples).

           There is a close relationship between descent theory in
      algebraic geometry and the theory of categories which are definable
      by means of standard constructions (tripleable categories). The
      "tripleableness theorem" sheds some light on descent criteria.
      The form of Cech cohomology used in descent theory is an
      appropriate triple cohomology theory. Its interpretation is
      discussed from the triple point of view. (Received October 2, 1967.)

It is possible that someone still has notes of that lecture 40 years
later.

Bill Lawvere

Readers of these lists may be interested to hear that the following paper

C. F=FChrmann and D. Pym. On categorical models of classical logic and th=
e=20
geometry of interaction.
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 17(5), 2007, 957-1027.

Abstract. It is well known that weakening and contraction cause naive=20
categorical models of the classical sequent calculus to collapse to=20
Boolean lattices. In previous work, summarised briefly herein, we have=20
provided a class of models called /classical categories/ that is sound=20
and complete and avoids this collapse by interpreting cut reduction by a=20
poset enrichment. Examples of classical categories include boolean=20
lattices and the category of sets and relations, where both conjunction=20
and disjunction are modelled by the set-theoretic product. In this=20
article, which is self-contained, we present an improved axiomatisation=20
of classical categories, together with a deep exploration of their=20
structural theory. Observing that the collapse already happens in the=20
absence of negation, we start with negation-free models called /Dummett=20
categories/. Examples of these include, besides the classical categories=20
mentioned above, the category of sets and relations, where both=20
conjunction and disjunction are modelled by the disjoint union. We prove=20
that Dummett categories are MIX, and that the partial order can be=20
derived from hom-semilattices, which have a straightforward=20
proof-theoretic definition. Moreover, we show that the=20
Geometry-of-Interaction construction can be extended from multiplicative=20
linear logic to classical logic by applying it to obtain a classical=20
category from a Dummett category.

Along the way, we gain detailed insights into the changes that proofs=20
undergo during cut elimination in the presence of weakening and=20
contraction.

On a related matter to the message below by Jiri, let me point out the
following paper:

   M. Fiore.  Differential structure in models of multiplicative
   biadditive intuitionistic linear logic.  In Typed Lambda Calculi
   and Applications (TLCA 2007), LNCS 4583, pp. 163-177, 2007.
   [Available from <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/latest.html>]

presenting a categorical framework for differentiation, directly
synthetised from the differential calculus of generalised species
of structures.  Though, as it transpired in conversation with Anders
Kock, the setting is also applicable to convenient vector spaces
and some models of SDG.

Perhaps some one took notes on paper and hasn't thrown them out?
It would be great to ad them to Jon's small nachlass.

Dear All,

Here is a new preprint. Sincerely yours. pg.

Author: P. Gaucher

Title:
Homotopical equivalence of combinatorial and categorical semantics of process
algebra

Abstract:
It is possible to translate a modified version of K. Worytkiewicz's
combinatorial semantics of CCS (Milner's Calculus of Communicating Systems)
in terms of labelled precubical sets into a categorical semantics of CCS in
terms of labelled flows using a geometric realization functor. It turns out
that a satisfactory semantics in terms of flows requires to work directly in
their homotopy category since such a semantics requires non-canonical choices
for constructing cofibrant replacements, homotopy limits and homotopy
colimits. No geometric information is lost since two precubical sets are
isomorphic if and only if the associated flows are weakly equivalent. The
interest of the categorical semantics is that combinatorics totally
disappears.  Last but not least, a part of the categorical semantics of CCS
goes down to a pure homotopical semantics of CCS using A. Heller's privileged
weak limits and colimits. These results can be easily adapted to any other
process algebra for any synchronization algebra.

I recently noticed that in Abstract no. 652-4 in the Notices
of the AMS volume 14 (1967) page 937, John Gray advocates a
systematic treatment of the calculus of comma categories
and lists five operations which should be explicitly accounted
for in such a calculus.
He also mentions that Jon Beck contributed to that discussion.

Probably John Gray's notes, if they still exist, would be
a helpful guide to someone planning to write a systematic
treatment as suggested recently Uwe Wolters.

As a followup to Bill's note, here is a slightly more recent positing by John
Gray to another mailing list on this very topic.

Comma categories are an ancient tool in category theory.
They were introduced in
	F. W. Lawvere, Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories
	Thesis, Columbia University, 1963.
He used them in
	 --, The category of categories as a foundation for
	mathematics, Proceedings of the Conference on Categorical
	Algebra, La Jolla 1965, Springer-Verlag, New York.
I discussed them in several places:
	J. W. Gray,  Fibred and cofibred categories, same proceedings
	as above, 21-83.
I gave a brief calculus of comma categories in:
	--, The categorical comprehension scheme, Category theory,
	Homology theory and their Applications III, Lecture Notes in
	Mathematics 99, Springer-Verlag, New York 1969, 242-312.
They are described as "Cartesian quasi-limits" in the book:
	--, Formal category theory: Adjointness for 2-categories,
	Lecture Notes in Mathematics 391, Springer-Verlag, New York 1974.
which is the first place where the lax description of them can be found.
I don't credit it to anybody there, since I assumed it was general knowledge.
The name was changed to "lax limits"  in:
	G. M. Kelly and R. Street, Review of the elements of 2-categories,
	Category Seminar, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 420, Springer-
	Verlag, New York 1974.
The general theory of the properties of lax limits in 2-categories was
discussed independently by Street and me in various publications.  E. g.,
	J. W. Gray, The existence and construction of lax limits,
	Cahiers Top. et Geom. Diff. 21 (1980), 277-304.
	--, Closed categories, Lax limits and homotopy limits, J. Pure
	Appl. Algebra 19 (1980), 127-158.
	--, The representation of limits, lax limits, and homotopy limits
	as sections, in Mathematical Applications of Category Theory,
	Contemporary Mathematics 30 (1984), AMS, 63-83.
	R. Street, Two constructions on lax functors, Cahiers Top. et
	Geom. Diff. 13, (1972), 217-264.
	--, Limits indexed by category-valued 2-functors, J. Pure and
	Applied Alg. 8 (1976), 149-181.

It is of course very gratifying to see these ideas coming around again as
useful tools in the semantics of programming languages.

	John Gray

Dear colleagues,

	Since 2003 all issues of the Bulletin of the EATCS, the European
Association for Theoretical Computer Science, have been produced
entirely electronically and made available on the web for members only.

	The EATCS is now piloting the idea of Open Access for the Bulletin,
in the spirit of best serving its research community. So, until
further notice the volumes from no 79 onwards of the Bulletin of the
EATCS will be available from

	http://www.eatcs.org/publications/bulletin.html

With best regards (and apologies for cross-posting)

Dear colleagues,

I have had, so far, no less than 22 answers to my mail about
references for the "Beck" theorem mentioned in the Elephant, all of
them supporting Peter Johnstone. An I am not counting "references"
which "referred" to other "reliable references" such as Dusko
Pavlovic an Claudio Hermida in one of the THIRTEEN mails sent by
Marta Bunge! I intend to answer in detail to all these mails.
It might take a few days, because I don't have such a powerful team
helping me in my research: bibliography, recollections, etc.
It takes ALL of my time, 12 hours a day, but I enjoy EVERY MINUTE OF
IT. I congratulate Peter Johnstone to have such a numerous and
faithful army of supporters. But as you say in English: "The more the
merrier". So Johnstone might use the delay before my answer to find a
few dozen more supporters. It will make me even more happy, and I'm
afraid he will need ALL the support he can get!

Dear Jean,

Here is what seems to be my 14th letter to you in this connection. It is a
friendly reminder that I did not "support" Peter Johnstone. Here is an
extract at the end of my November 4 official intervention ("Response to
Benabou") in categories.


>It seems then to be an error on the part of Peter Johnstone to have
>attributed Proposition 1.5.5 in E1 (page 297) to Beck and not to Benabou
>and Roubaud. At the end of this section on "Descent Conditions and Stacks"
>(page 303), the references given in El 1 are Bourn, Bunge and Pare, Giraud,
>Grothendieck, Reiterman and Tholen, but curiously enough, not
>Benabou-Roubaud. I am sure that Peter will repair this error should a
>second edition of the Elephant ever appear.

In fact, I do not think that Peter Johnstone "supports" himself in this
matter -- he has admitted the error. What more do you want him to say?


However, in view of the evidence, provided by Street and Lawvere, of the
possibility that Jon Beck may have discovered this theorem independently and
even talked about it, as the abstract in the Notices of the AMS (1967) seems
to indicate, it seems fair after all to add his name to yours in connection
with it. It is common pratice in mathematics to give credit for ideas
disseminated at lectures, even more so if these ideas are mentioned in an
abstract. This does not take away your own credit.

This is my very last letter on the subject, private or official.

With best wishes,
Marta

[Note from moderator: I agree with Dusko's remarks below. After 48 hours
no further items will be posted in this thread. Moderate language will be
used in any contributions posted during that time.]

am i the only one who is not enjoying these arguments on CATEGORIES any
more? i started worrying:

** is there something special in category theory that attracts all these
** argumentative people? is it that being argumentative somehow helps you
** with math, and then arguing with the symbols on a piece of paper and on
** the blackboards then somehow overflows into your social life?...

and then i remembered that sometime in the early 90s, when the mailing
lists started spreading, there were such flame wars on every mailing list.
and they went on deep into the mid 90es. so i thought, maybe the category
theorists are not more argumentative than other people. maybe it's just
that some of them started using email a bit later, so they are
discovering the medium of flame war just now. so i waved my hand.

but now great jean benabou brought my little name into his argument,
together with claudio hermida. i am not sure what he means, but it sounds
like claudio and i are the examples of unreliable sources.

well, honestly, jean, i really don't have the remotest idea what i have
done to deserve the unhonorable mention. not having worked in anything
related to this area for more than 10 years, and not having done much
worth mentioning before that, AND not really depending on this community
either for my job or for my reputation, i am simply just surprised...

even after 10 min of scouring my memory, the only *remote* possibility
that occurs to me is that i gave a talk in oberwolfach, cca 1994,
describing the preservation conditions necessary and sufficient for
descent, and effective descent ((monadicity is sufficient, but not
necessary)). after my talk, or maybe in the middle, jean benabou stood up
and said: "Mathematics Should Be Beautiful." i started mumbling that i
was sorry if mine was so ugly ((was it my hand drawn diagrams on the
slides?)), but that some people would say that mathematics should first
of all be true... by which point we were both talking --- and max kelly
hushed us both down. (we miss you, max!)

i really really respect jean benabou's work. i also respect paul taylor's
work. i have learned a great deal from both of them. but i really don't
like how they argue their cases on this mailing list. (and if i am alone
in that, then maybe i dont even belong here.)

i agree that mathematics should be beautiful. short of that, since the
truth doesn't always obey everyone's taste, math should at least be
elegant, or decent.

but if we are able to produce beautiful, or elegant, or at least decent
mathematical arguments --- why is it that we generate such unpleasant
nonmathematical arguments? can we please please stop?

all the best,
-- dusko

The recent postings of Jean Benabou have, it seems to me,
had at least two effects:

1. promoting a better understanding of
the historical truth
of how, in what order, and by whom various categorical ideas
were discovered and disseminated, and

2. in confronting possible inaccuracies
in some other mathematicians understanding of the same,
making some of those other mathematicians, and no doubt some bystanders,
uncomfortable (to say the least)
at the inflammatory tone of some of M. Benabou's remarks.

I think the first effect is salutary and beneficial to the understanding of
the past,
and thus also, to the future.
It would be unfortunate and, I believe, harmful,
to prevent M. Benabou from assisting the mathematical community
in obtaining better understanding of the categorical past.

On the other hand,
at least one thing should not have been said on this mailing list,
or elsewhere:
"I advise [Peter Johnstone] to lose very quickly such habits,
they might become dangerous for one's health."
(Benabou's message of November 3).
Threats, explicit or implict, to the reputation of individuals are
permissible
(one's reputation is a function of the collective body),
while threats to one's "health" are not.

As a proposal, and request to the moderator to modify
his "48 hour" limit imposed in his addition to Dusko Pavlovic's message of
November 9,
I suggest the following rule:

The discussion and argument may continue
to the point of diminishing returns (repetition and triviality).
Threats of illegal action (such as the one quoted above) will not be
allowed.
A positive and respectful tone,
accepting the good faith and intentions of all parties,
is required.

Again, the intent is to keep the good (increased understanding),
while avoiding the bad (unnecessary insults and threats).

By the way, I am, shall we say,
an interested bystander to the discussions on this list.
The fact that my contributions to category theory are nil
may, on the one hand,
mean that I do not have the right to intrude in this matter,
or on the other hand,
may mean that I can be more objective,
without axes to grind or anything to defend or assert.
You choose which to believe.

In any case, thanks to all parties,
Rosebrugh, Benabou, Johnstone and all the others
for your vast and much appreciated contributions
both to mathematical research and to this list.

Sincerely,
Keith Harbaugh

Dear Colleagues,

I agree with Dusko that it is much better to avoid any offensive
remarks and I agree with every word Marta says in what she calls her
"seems to be 14th" message. On the other hand, it really feels as
everyone is trying to argue against Jean, gently or less gently=85 and
then it is understandable if Jean's remarks become a bit (or more than
a bit) angry.

Removing "offensive", "against", and "angry", I think this discussion
was actually very useful since it gave new information on the history
of an important mathematical discovery (I essentially knew what Ross
said because I heard that from Ross before, but I did not know about
Jon's talk in 1967 mentioned by Bill).

Let me also add that [G. Janelidze and W. Tholen, Facets of descent I,
Applied Categorical Structures, Vol. 2, No 2, 1994, 245-281] refers
(for the "monadicity=3Ddescent") to both B=E9nabou and Roubaud and to
Beck. However: while the precise reference on the B=E9nabou-Roubaud
paper is given there, Beck's name is mentioned without any reference
to a paper (since as far as we knew he did not publish such a paper).

I also had feeling confirmed by this discussion that nobody really
remembers what exactly did Jon do, while the B=E9nabou-Roubaud paper is
available to everyone=85

NOTE TO THE MODERATOR

You have tried, and succeeded, to stop me in the beginning of 2006,
when I wanted to oppose to the preposterous change of "cartesian" and
"cocartesian" into "prone" and "supine".

You shall not stop me now!

I have received more than 30 mails in ten days. I HAVE A RIGHT OF
REPLY, which is admitted by every civilized community, and I
explicitly refer to it ! Thus, I ASK for TEN DAYS ACCESS TO THIS LIST
STARTING AT THE MOMENT I RECEIVE AN ANSWER FROM YOU TO THE PRESENT MAIL

Even this is unfair, because I am alone to do answer an ever growing
group of correspondents. But I will do with 10 days. Unless of course
I receive more mails during these 10 days, in which case the delay
for my answers will be extended.

If you try to stop me I shall send my answers, together with this mail,
  directly to the members of the category list whose mail address I
have.

But not only to them.

There are a lot of mathematicians, in category theory and other
fields, French and of all citizenships, who would be very interested
to receive it. Some of them would just "adore" to receive it.

Especially if I join the pdf. file I made in 2006 which is on my
computer under the name "Kafka in category-land". It contains, among
many other things,  a "lesson of typography" by Wood, a very elegant
mail by Paul Taylor suggesting that I was now too old and should
concentrate my activities to harmless "playing with my rattles and
fluffs", and the mails we exchanged during that period

I shall also send a copy to the French "Academie des Sciences" where
my joint note was published, to the "Societe Mathematique de France",
where some persons literally worship Grothendieck, and others tend to
like some of my mathematical "rattles and fluffs".

And also to any other institution I can think of.

So far, in all the mails I have received, there is not the slightest
proof that Beck had proved the theorem attributed to him by
Johnstone, let alone any justification of the fact that he "forgot"
to mention in his bibliography the Benabou-Roubaud  (B.R) note.

The problem is not only a matter of "priority" of the (B.R) note. In
some of the answers, in particular in Johnstone's, other subjects
have been evoked e.g. Celeyrette's thesis, my Louvain paper, and many
other "omissions". I shall mention them. I intend to give proofs to
support each of my statements

So I "beg" you Mr. Moderator, don't interfere!

The persons who sent more than 30 mails on this question, and in
particular Johnstone, are adults. Let them SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. And
let the mathematical community be the sole judge!

As I am invoking my RIGHT TO ANSWER, I shall tolerate NOT A SINGLE
CHANGE in  the present mail. I am addressing it to the "Category
list", not only to you Mr. Moderator, thus of course I  want it to
be  sent to all members of this list.

1- TYPOGRAPHY AND MODERATION

In this mailing list, such fonts as "bold face", "italics", etc are =20
not accepted, only lower and upper case letters can be used. I =20
mention these trivialities because in february 2006 I received a =20
lesson of typography from Wood. As I receive more and more "lessons" =20
through this mailing list, I have made a file in my computer, with =20
these lessons, an a few other things, under the name of : " Kafka in =20
Category-land". I have consulted my "Kafka-file" thus I can quote =20
precisely Wood's lesson:

  "Jean Benabou...should also be told that ordinary words written in =20
upper case are understood to be SHOUTED ".

I have not the slightest intention to shout in this mail, nor in any =20
other I send through this mailing list. But, in spite of Wood's =20
lesson, because of the drastic typographical limitations of this =20
list, I shall use upper case letters for titles, subtitles, or =20
whenever I want to emphasize a word or a sentence.
  And if Professor Wood disapproves my decision, I refer him to Freyd =20=

and Scedrov who used quite liberally upper case letters in their =20
book, although they had huge typographical possibilities, including =20
very fancy "punctured diagrams".

I'm getting a bit tired by the ever increasing number of lessons I =20
receive in this mail. About every subject. Except mathematics, which =20
I'd very much like to receive. Unfortunately in this domain I'm =20
usually on the "giving" side. As for example in my mail on locally =20
cartesian closed categories.

Most of you know that English is not my mother language. I try to =20
write it as well as I can. If you find something wrong in my typing, =20
my spelling, my grammar, or even my "style", forgive me. But no more =20
"lessons' please!

I shall try to answer to each of the persons who have participated to =20=

this discussion. There are many, and there might even be more since I =20=

received this morning mails from Janelidze and Hardbaugh. You'll =20
understand that, even if I work full time at it, and I do, it will =20
not be possible to "sort out" the order of my answers, so i'll give =20
each of them as soon as I have enough documentation to complete it. I =20=

apologize if some of you will have to wait longer than others.

I have been advised many times to use "moderation" in my answers. I =20
am usually a moderate person, but I shall try to be even more so. =20
Please try to make the the same "effort" when addressing to me. I =20
shall use in each individual answer the same "degree of moderation"  =20
as the one I found in the mail (or mails) I'm answering to. for =20
example in my :

2- ANSWER TO DUSKO PAVLOVIC

 =46rom his mail I quote:

"but now great jean benabou brought my little name into his argument,
together with claudio hermida. i am not sure what he means, but it =20
sounds
like claudio and i are the examples of unreliable sources."

And I answer : Great Dusko Pavlovic, with all due respect of course, =20
little Jean Benabou would like to point out that it was never him, =20
but Marta Bunge who brought your great name, together with Claudio =20
Hermida's, into this argument.

As for your reliability, and the relevance of your testimony in this =20
subject, I
do not have the slightest doubt about them. It seems that Peter =20
Johnstone has some, because from one of his mails to Marta I quote:

"Without wishing to be rude, I'm not sure that I would take Dusko as an
authority on the history of category theory"

I do not know what he meant by that, thus I'm afraid that 4 persons: =20
Claudio, Marta  Peter, and great Dusko, will have to "sort out" their =20=

big problems.

They are no concern of little Jean Benabou.

Respectfully yours,Jean.

3- ANSWER TO JIM STASHEFF

I quote:

"Perhaps some one took notes on paper and hasn't thrown them out?
It would be great to ad them to Jon's small nachlass."

A very good question Jim, even if your purpose is different from mine =20=

I totally agree with it. I'm surprised nobody did come out with an =20
answer. And I ask you a straightforward question:

Aren't YOU surprised that of this "mythical" result, there is not a =20
single written trace, no publication by Beck or by ANYONE who would =20
have used his result in his work. And no written notes?

I won't be as choosy as Peter Johnstone, and will accept any =20
reference in a thesis, a prepublication in the most obscure =20
university, anterior to my joint paper with Roubaud. Fair enough?

4- ANSWER TO MICHAEL BARR

 =46rom the second answer of Barr I quote

"Jon had a precise formulation of a rather simple special case that =20
did not mention either fibrations or indexed categories (the latter =20
didn't exist at the time"

This, for me, settles the problem on two counts:
(i) I learnt the Chevalley conditions from Chevalley in 1964, in a =20
public course, he is dead, but many people who attended this =20
course,in particular Jacques Roubaud, but many others I know, will be =20=

quite ready to testify if you "force me to ask them".
The Chevalley condition is about FIBRATIONS, it can of course be =20
reformulated in terms of "indexed categories" which, according to =20
Barr, didn't exist at the time, neither did fibrations, the first =20
mention of them in "Category-land" is in John Gray's paper in La =20
Jolla (1965). Thus Beck couldn't have discovered this condition in =20
1964. And I promise to rise a public debate, outside of this list, if =20=

the name of Jon Beck is mentioned about them in the future.

Some people seem to believe that there were no categories outside of =20
"Category-land". Typical of this attitude, sorry Mike, is your =20
statement that indexed categories DIDN'T EXIST at the time.

They were invented by Grothendieck in 1961, NOT by Lawvere in 1971.

The main mistake of this "fertile brain" (El; preface) was to have =20
called them "pseudo-functors" which isn't such a bad name after all. =20
At the same period he did a much much more INEXCUSABLE mistake, =20
namely: not realizing that: The Times They Are A'changin' (Bob Dylan, =20=

1964). And that "prone" and "supine" were obviously more "chic" than =20
the "overworked" "cartesian" and "cocartesian".
(I shall examine this question of "terminology" in more detail in my =20
answer to Peter Johnstone)


Thus the Benabou-Roubaud result cannot have been proved by Beck. It's =20=

a result about Chevalley bi-fibrations, which can be,but why should =20
they be?, reformulated in terms of indexed-categories. But none of =20
the two "existed" according to Barr, and not in "category-land" =20
according to Benabou.

(For more details about this "non-existence", I also refer to my =20
answer to Bill Lawvere, which will be come next)

5- ANSWER TO WILLIAM LAWVERE

I quote you:

"I would like to urge the readers of our categories list to study =20
Jon's 1967 thesis which is now available via TAC Reprints. There one =20
finds Jon's tripleability theorems which were used for example by =20
Benabou and Roubaud in their 1970 paper on descent"

Sorry Bill, don't CONFUSE THE ISSUES: We are talking about  =20
Chevalley's condition, and my joint result with Roubaud about the =20
relation between "descent data" and algebras for a monad. ABSOLUTELY =20
NOT about Beck's tripleability theorems,  which we used, with due =20
reference, in our note. Is there ANY mention in this "now available" =20
thesis of fibrations, of ANY KIND of condition on fibrations, and of =20
"descent data". If there is none, mentioning this thesis is totally =20
IRRELEVANT to the present discussion.

One of the major interests of our result, was that it gave the =20
possibility TO USE Beck's theorems, in a totally "new" domain, namely =20=

"descent", and that IN ORDER TO DO IT, Chevalley's condition was =20
sufficient. It is also necessary, which means our result CANNOT be =20
improved! Can anyone after 37 years, give a better result, of course =20
in the general case of fibrations (or indexed categories, if you =20
still prefer them!)
Of course, in special cases you can get "better" results. Going to =20
the extreme, I can "prove" that, for the identity fibration, every =20
map is a descent map!

Our result can be GENERALIZED, if one generalizes the notion of =20
descent. I have had such a huge generalization for many years, in a =20
paper called "what is descent in year 2000?"

I am NOT going to talk about it, or about many new results of mine =20
concerning not only  fibered categories, but the much more general =20
FOLIATED ones, I have defined and studied, because in these sad, sad =20
times, I'm SURE I would find these results in some other "Elephant", =20
re-named, duly "re-indexated", and with NO reference to me. For =20
"space-saving" reasons, of course!

I quote you again:

"Ross remembers that Jon arrived in Tulane in 1969 prepared to
lecture on triples and descent"

First big mistake Bill. Ross mentioned that Jon arrived in Tulane =20
after I left. And I was there in early 1970. So the earliest Jon =20
could have been there was spring 1970, not 1969! Although I have many =20=

answers to give, in each case I check all the "details"; and in this =20
case it is NOT a detail.

Ross also "remembers" that Jon DID NOT speak. Neither in a formal =20
lecture, nor in INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS, with ANYBODY. I was in Tulane =20
at about the same period, there was quite a concentration of category =20=

theorists, and "I remember", that apart from the formal lectures, =20
there were many informal discussions, as there are in any category =20
theory meeting, or in ANY mathematical meeting.

Quite surprising, isn't it, that Jon spoke to NOBODY who can =20
"remember" ANYTHING

Quotation again

"I heard Jon lecturing on that topic already in late 1967 at a =20
meeting of the American Mathematical Society in Illinois. In =20
particular, he explicitly stated the condition that I therefore =20
called the "Beck condition" in my work on Hyperdoctrines (presented =20
to an AMS meeting in NYC in early 1968)

On what "topic"? If it is "the" Chevalley condition, Chevalley =20
lectured about it in 1964, i.e. four years BEFORE the 1968 meeting =20
you mentioned (He probably had it before 1964, but 1964 is good =20
enough for me!)

You probably remember that I spent the academic year 1966-67 in =20
Chicago. We even shared the SAME office. There were many meetings of =20
the Midwest Category Seminar, And "I remember", with precision, that =20
I was AMAZED by the fact that fibered categories and descent were not =20=

mentioned A SINGLE TIME  during that whole year.

My surprise was all the greater since in Paris, the Grothendieck. =20
school was devoting a lot of time and energy on this "topic"; I might =20=

remind to some of those who have small problems with their memory, =20
that Giraud's thesis was published in 1964 and the title was "Methode =20=

de la Descente". And of course, of the fundamental paper of =20
Grothendieck, "Categories fibrees et Descente" (1961).

As a side remark, you are of course aware that "Hyperdoctrines" are =20
an important, but very special case of fibrations . And I am still =20
waiting for an answer to the question I asked in my previous mail: =20
Has ANYBODY defined a notion of morphism of Hyperdoctrines, and, if =20
nobody has, WHY NOT?

Thus sorry Bill, with all due respect, I don't think Jon Beck, =20
"invented" the Chevalley condition, and if he proved ANYTHING about =20
Monads and descent, it must have been in a very, very special case, =20
since as Michael Barr stated it a bit curiously, "indexed  =20
categories", let alone fibrations, "did not exist" when we published =20
our note.

One more "detail" , I greatly admire your deep mathematical insight, =20
therefore I am convinced that if you had heard Beck speaking about =20
our joint theorem, you would immediately have understood its meaning, =20=

and its possible consequences, and either you, or some of your =20
students, or both, would IMMEDIATELY  have put the theorem "at work". =20=

And it would have found its way very quickly in many papers and =20
books. Just as Beck's tripleability theorems did, and were frequently =20=

quoted, and "refined". e.g. in a long paper by Duskin in the Reports =20
of the Midwest Category Seminar (RMCS) , Springer Lecture Notes (LN) =20
106 (1969).

No mention of fibrations or descent in Duskin's paper, although Jack =20
quoted in his bibliography: BECK , J., untitled manuscript, Cornell, =20
1966.
No mention in this whole (LN). No mention in the next RMCS, LN137,1970.

WHERE ARE THE PAPERS BILL? Was all "Category-land" ASLEEP between =20
1967 and 1971?

Again a quotation

"Later I saw this condition referred to as the Chevalley condition in =20=

a paper of J-L Verdier. I do not know whether Jon was familiar with =20
that work of Chevalley"

Later than what? Again I insist on the fact that Chevalley's =20
condition is about fibrations. You "do not know", but ,concerning the =20=

question of priority of Chevalley, with all due respect, what YOU =20
know is not the issue. Neither is what I know, but at least, I was in =20=

Paris in the years 1960-1965, where all these things happened, I =20
participated in some of them, thus what I know, I know "first hand".

"Final" quotation:

"The abstracts for the talks at that meeting were published in the
Notices of the AMS Volume 14 (1967). On page 938 one finds
Jon Beck's abstract:

      652-8. Jon Beck, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. Descent and
      standard constructions (triples).

           There is a close relationship between descent theory in
      algebraic geometry and the theory of categories which are =20
definable
      by means of standard constructions (tripleable categories). The
      "tripleableness theorem" sheds some light on descent criteria.
      The form of Cech cohomology used in descent theory is an
      appropriate triple cohomology theory. Its interpretation is
      discussed from the triple point of view. (Received October 2, =20
1967.)

It is possible that someone still has notes of that lecture 40 years =20
later"

Again sorry Bill. There is A HUGE difference between noting that in =20
one, or perhaps a few, SPECIAL CASES, such as Cech cohomology, there =20
was a "close relationship", which "sheds some light" on descent =20
criteria, and a precise GENERAL theorem, which, in order to be =20
stated, needs fibrations, AND the Chevalley condition!

As I already mentioned,Beck's tripleability theorems found their =20
place IMMEDIATELY in countless books and papers,WHY NOT "his" other =20
theorem? WHEN is the first precise mention of it before, say, 1975.

There is A WHOLE CHAPTER in Mac Lane's CWM book (1971) devoted to =20
monads, no mention of Beck's "contribution" to descent. Not in the =20
exercises also, not even in the informal historical note, where he =20
could have mentioned it  without giving details. So WHERE ARE the =20
publications, by Beck or ANYBODY, mentioning "his" theorem, or USING it?

Sorry Bill you have totally failed to convince me. If you have =20
convinced other persons, when I answer them, I shall carefully  study =20=

their arguments and shall try to answer them. But I won't even bother =20=

to answer to "religious" arguments of the form "I believe that" Beck =20
had the theorem because Bill Lawvere "said so". Absolutely no offense =20=

meant to you Bill, "I believe" in your deep insight in mathematics, =20
"I believe" in the importance of your contributions to category =20
theory. But, please Bill, don't ask me to believe in more.

Maybe it is high time that some persons realize and/or admit  that, =20
NOT ALL of category theory was born in "category-land", and some of =20
it still lives "abroad".

6- ANSWER TO ROSS STREET

I quote :

"the "indexed categories " of Pare-Schumacher" !?

Sorry Ross, the "indexed categories" are not Pare-Schumacher, and not =20=

Lawvere. They are, as I mentioned to Barr, also due to the "fertile =20
brain" of "you know who". I have repeated this for more than 35 =20
years. Vainly it seems. And since you are kind enough to mention my =20
1967 paper on bicategories that many a'member of "Category land", and =20=

quite a few "outlandish" mathematicians have read, they are in this =20
paper, in detail, page 47,  under the name of pseudo-functors and and =20=

in the bibliography, clearly attributed to you know who. Can't most =20
category-landers read? That paper was written in English if my memory =20=

doesn't " fail me" .

By the way, "descent data" were also in this paper, "profunctors" =20
were announced page 49, and  the fundamental theorem extending =20
Grothrndieck's construction to morphisms:
E=B0-->Prof
was clearly stated, together with the applications I had in mind.

Thank you for having "forced" me to re-read that 40 years old paper =20
which i had not looked at for more than 30 years. It hasn't aged at =20
all, and I can still recommend it for the variety of important =20
examples it contained. Some of which I didn't remember I had =20
mentioned at that "prehistorical" age.

I quote you again

"I learnt from Benabou's lectures about the "Chevalley condition" for =20=

fibrations and how descent data were Eilenberg-Moore algebras. Jean =20
gave me a copy of his Comptes Rendus article with Jacques Roubaud"
"Very soon after Jean Benabou left, Jon Beck arrived ...When I told =20
him about Benabou's lecture on descent, he said that that was what he =20=

had planned to talk about ("triples" and descent). I encouraged him =20
to do so but he decided to change his topic."

Thus, you didn't hear Beck speak, not even in a private conversation, =20=

on a "mythic" theorem he MIGHT have had about fibered or indexed =20
categories, which "DIDN'T EXIST".

And that, of course, fully justifies Jonhstone not only for giving =20
Beck full credit, but "forgetting" to mention in his bibliography our =20=

joint note. Which I gave you personally, and lectured publicly about. =20=

And, by a strange "coincidence", the theorem stated by Johnstone, was =20=

PRECISELY, the one in our note! I said I wouldn't shout, so I don't. =20
I'm not sure that Roubaud won't when he learns about the very =20
"special" sense of history and honesty which seems to prevail in =20
"Category-land"!

And "operads", comma objects, and other 2-categorical "whatnots" =20
won't hide the real issue of Johnstone, KNOWING WHAT HE WAS DOING, =20
falsified "history" as you call it. But he did that SO MANY TIMES, =20
with MY work in particular, and with the approbation of many members =20
of  the establishment  of "Category-land", that he thinks he can get =20
away with "anything".

On a totally different question, I quote you again:

"Now, as much as I would love SIX bottles of GOOD champagne, I am not =20=

going
to submit a suggestion for Jean's challenge. Composition of =20
fibrations is
a wonderful thing as is composition of homomorphisms of bicategories; =20=

but
they do different jobs. It is hard enough to say fibrations are =20
composable
from the homomorphism viewpoint!

There is a thing about this that requires a mixture of the two views.
Regard one fibration p : E --> A as a homomorphism E_ : A --> Cat. Keep
the other q : A -- > B as a fibration. Then the homomorphism =20
corresponding
to the composite q p is a generalized left Kan extension of E_ along q."

In my paper on bicategories, I gave a lot of examples. One of which =20
was pseudo-functors, now called indexed categories, and attributed to =20=

Lawvere. But I NEVER mentioned fibrations in that paper, although I =20
knew about them, and about Chevalley's condition, which I remind you, =20=

I learned in 1964. Because I KNEW, already at that time, that in =20
spite of what "The Elephant" says:

FIBRATIONS AND "INDEXED CATEGORIES", ARE NOT THE SAME THING.

Because:

(i) The theory of fibrations is a FIRST ORDER theory, the "theory" of =20=

indexed categories IS NOT. It is not even a "higher order theory" =20
however "high" you are ready to go.

(ii)  Fibrations can be INTERNALIZED in a topos (a logical category =20
suffices), indexed categories CANNOT.

(iii) To go from an "indexed category" to a fibration, by the =20
Grothendieck construction, DOES NOT require the axiom of choice (AC) =20
whereas in the other direction YOU NEED AC. For sets, if you restrict =20=

to small categories, and for classes (whatever that means) if you =20
deal with big ones, even if they are locally small.

In most definitions, constructions and proofs with fibered =20
categories, all we need is FINITE DIAGRAMS involving vertical and =20
cartesian maps (sorry, "prone" maps if you understand those better). =20
We almost never need a cleavage of the fibration, which requires AC. =20
And in the very, very few cases where we do need it, a special =20
emphasis should be put on this necessity.

(iv ) Last, but not least, fibrations DO compose, and "indexed =20
categories" DON'T

And because of this last fact, I knew I was taking no big risk by =20
offering champagne! But of course, MY OFFER IS STILL STANDING.

Sorry Ross, you don't qualify for even A GLASS of champagne. =20
Nevertheless I'll be very happy to offer you more than a glass if you =20=

visit me in Paris, for old friendship's sake, but not for having come =20=

any close to answering my question.

And your so called "mixture of two views", requires, if you start =20
with two "indexed categories", FIRST TO REPLACE one of them by a =20
fibration, and THEN, to use   generalized left Kan extensions. You =20
CANNOT avoid the first step, can you? All this complication compared =20
with the well known, 5 lines proof or no proof  at all, result : =20
fibrations are stable under composition.

Quite (un) surprisingly, I could not find any "trace" of this result =20
in the "monumental" Elephant. Am I wrong professor Johnstone? Are you =20=

going to explain, AGAIN, as for my Louvain Paper, Celeyrette's =20
thesis, and the Comptes Rendus note that it was because of a "space-=20
saving decision"?

Well, I've tried to explain, as I have done now for more than 30 =20
years, why I thought, and think more and more now, especially after =20
reading some "surprising" pages of the Elephant, that "indexed =20
categories" were to put it mildly, a WRONG manner to view fibered =20
categories.(See again (i) (ii) and (iv) even if you want to assume =20
any form of AC). But as we say in France:

"Il n'est pire sourd que qui ne veut entendre"

  Even Peter Johnstone, who has been coeditor with Bob Pare of LN 611 =20=

(1978) "Indexed Categories and their applictions"  has been" forced" =20
to introduce fibered categories in his Elephant. Very badly I must =20
say, And, of course, with the same "space-saving" attitude concerning =20=

good references.Especially to my work!

As for me, I have never been "forced" to change my position. "Fibered =20=

man" I was, from the beginning, and "fibered man" I remain. I don't =20
even have to compromise, and become "half-fibered and half-indexed".

I"ll interrupt this mail now because:
(i) I don't want it to be rejected because it is too long
(ii) I really need some sleep!
(iii) Although many other answers are almost finished, I need a =20
little more documentation to be absolutely sure about a few facts.

I shall continue my answers on tuesday, meanwhile any further =20
"testimonies" or "comments" from any of you, even from the very =20
"prolific" Marta, will be welcome!

Before I stop, I'd like to add a very special

7- ANSWER TO RONNIE BROWN

Dear Ronnie,

Please forgive me for not having answered earlier to your very kind, =20
and nice message of october 31. I appreciated it all the more because =20=

it was the only mathematical "reaction" I received after my long mail =20=

concerning locally cartesian categories, and "a few other things".

I want to thank you publicly. And I want also to tell you that in the =20=

"help!" discussion about what to tell to absolute beginners about =20
Category Theory, your contribution was, by far, the one I appreciated =20=

most.

You'll understand why, if I tell you that in 1999, in a colloquium on =20=

history and philosophy of mathematics I gave a talk with the title =20
"Une analogie en theorie des categories". Moreover in the =20
introduction of this talk I explained that I had  intended initially =20
to speak about : "Analogies et theorie des categories". And a first =20
draft of more than 120 pages, covering only a part of what I wanted =20
to say, convinced me that "une analogie" would suffice.

I hope when this unpleasant phase is finished, if it is ever =20
finished, that we'll have more time to compare our ideas. They will =20
probably not coincide, but I'm sure we will very quickly agree on =20
many many points.

Meanwhile, many thanks again,

Jean=

I would like to know whether a category theoretic "rationalization" of the
mathematical theory of thermodynamics published by Elliot H. Lieb
and Jakob Yngvason has been published or at least undertaken. Their axioms
add structure to a preorder:

\begin{description}
\item [(A1) Reflexivity.] $X \stackrel {A}{\sim} X$.
\item [(A2) Transitivity.] $X \prec Y$ and $Y \prec Z$ imply $X \prec Z$.
\item [(A3) Consistency.] $X \prec X'$ and $Y \prec Y'$ imply $(X,Y)
\prec (X',Y')$.
\item [(A4) Scaling Invariance.] If $X \prec Y$, then $tX \prec tY$
for all $t>0$.
\item [(A5) Splitting and recombination.] For $0 < t < 1$,
\begin{center}$X\stackrel {A}{\sim} (tX,(1-t)X)$.\end{center}
\item [(A6) Stability.] If, for some pair of states, $X$ and $Y$,
\begin{center} $(X,\epsilon Z_0) \prec (Y, \epsilon Z_1)$\end{center}
\noindent holds for a sequence of $\epsilon$'s tending to zero and
some some states $Z_0, Z_1$, then $X \prec Y$.
\item [(CH) Comparison hypothesis.] For any two states $X$ and $Y$
in the same state space, either $X \prec Y$ or $Y \prec X$.
\end{description}

Jean Benabou has asked whether morphisms between hyperdoctrines have been
considered in categorical logic.

In work on "parametric polymorphism" (for polymorphic lambda calculus),
see

   Birkedal, Lars; Mogelberg, Rasmus E.
   Categorical models for Abadi and Plotkin's logic for parametricity.
   Math. Structures Comput. Sci. 15  (2005), no. 4, 709--772.

based on previous work by Robinson and Rosolini (1994) on

    "Reflexive graphs and parametric polymorphism" (Proc. LICS 1994)

reflexive graphs in the category of PL-hyperdoctrines (models for polymorphic
lambda calculus) find an essential use. Moreover, the involved
PL-hyperdoctrines live over different bases.

In B.Jacobs book "Categorical Logic and Type Theory" (Elsevier, 1999) the
work of Robinson and Rosolini is briefly addressed and a few hundred pages
earlier he discusses morphisms between hyperdoctrines for equational logic
(however, without further exploiting this notion).

In work on "tripos theory"  (late 70ies) Hyland, Johnstone and Pitts have
considered geometric morphisms between triposes and shown that via the
tripos-to-topos construction give rise to (localic) geometric morphisms
between the associated toposes.
This has been used over and over again in subsequent work on realizability
and related structures (e.g. modified realizability).

Currently a student of mine (Jonas Frey) is writing up in his diploma
thesis a universal characterisation of the "tripos-to-topos" construction
as an (appropriately lax) left adjoint to the functor sending a topos to
its associated subobject fibration (which is a tripos). Even in order to
formulate this result one has to consider a category of triposes over
different bases. (I am confident that his work will be available from my
homepage end of this year).

As far as I know there is no systematic study of morphism between
hyperdoctrines (of the kind as Jean probably has in mind). But now and
then particular instances have been considered and put to use
for particular purposes.

                   http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/cie08/

   Computability in Europe 2008: Logic and Theory of Algorithms

                        University of Athens
                       Athens, June 15-20 2008


PAPER SUBMISSION is now OPEN:
            http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/cie08/submission.php


This is the fourth in a series of conferences organised by CiE
(Computability in Europe), a European network of mathematicians,
logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and
others interested in new developments in computability and their
underlying significance for the real world. Previous meetings took
place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006) and Siena (2007).

CiE 2008 aims at bridging the gap from the logical methods of
mathematical and meta-mathematical flavour to the applied and
industrial questions that are involved in devising and choosing
the right algorithms and analysing their effectiveness and efficiency.

Is the Heyting algebra of global elements of the classifier in an
elementary topos always complete? (Of course, the classifier is complete
internally; here, I mean externally complete.) I suspect not, but I
can't presently think of a natural counterexample.

The answer is no: any Boolean algebra, complete or not, can occur
as Sub(1) in a topos (see Exercise 9.11 in my old Topos Theory book),
and any quotient of a complete Heyting algebra (by a finitary Heyting
congruence -- such quotients needn't be complete) can occur, by use of
the filterpower construction (cf. my paper with Murray Adelman "Serre
classes for toposes", Bull.Austral.Math.Soc. 25 (1982), 103-115).
There are examples due to Peter Freyd
of Heyting algebras which can't occur as Sub(1) in a topos
generated by subobjects of 1. For a long time it was an open
problem whether any Heyting algebra can occur as Sub(1) in a topos
(without the restriction on generators): Dito Pataraia has recently
announced a positive solution to this problem. I have heard a seminar
talk about his solution, and seen half of a preprint, but haven't yet
managed to understand the other half of his construction.

Of course not !
Elementary toposes are models of a first order theory (this is also =20
true for elementary toposes with an NNO) . Thus there are countable =20
models. In such a model the answer is no.

I also suspect that Sub(1) of the free topos with nno is not complete.
But countability does not suffice for refuting completeness (the ordinal
\omega + 1 is an infinite countable cHa which nevertheless is complete).
>From Goedel's Theorem for HAH (higher order intuit. arithmetic) it follows

they claim "Lindenbaum algebras are almost never complete" but don't give

Ah, but if a Heyting algebra is complete, then so is the Boolean algebra
of all not-not-stable elements.  Familiar example: the regular open
subsets of a topological space form a complete Boolean algebra.

As remarked, the Sub(1) of the free topos with nno is not atomic, and with
reference again to Godel's theorem via the not-not translation, the
Boolean algebra of not-not-stable elements is also non atomic.  But all
countable, non-atomic Boolean algebras are isomorphic to the clopen
subsets of the Cantor space (or the Lindenbaum algebra of classical
propositional calculus, or the free Boolean algebra on countably many
generators).  That algebra is not complete -- as can be seen in many ways.
Q.E.D.

        an initiative of the 31st International Conference
               in Software Engineering (ICSE 2009)
                16-24 May 2009, Vancouver, Canada

ICSE 2009 in Vancouver, Canada will see the first finals of the SCORE
Software Engineering Contest. Teams from all over the world will enter
in a competition that is open to students from undergraduate to master=92=
s
level. Each team will develop a system chosen from those proposed by
SCORE committee members. Teams will produce a report as their first
deliverable, followed by a prototype system for those chosen as
semi-finalists. Evaluation will be based on the quality of the software
engineering process followed, as well as the outcome.

In order to accommodate all academic calendars, the 2009 SCORE Contest
will run from December 2007 to January 2009 with with team sign-up
starting in February 2008 and ending in November 2008. Up to 10 finalist
teams will be announced in April 2009. At least one representative from
each of the finalist teams will have expenses paid to attend ICSE in
Vancouver, 16-24 May 2009, for final judging.

The SCORE Contest is aimed at promoting and fostering software
engineering in universities worldwide. The committee consists of members
of industry and academia. Each participating team will benefit from the
experience of working on member selected projects, and from being part
of an exciting new venture.

Program Chairs:
Mehdi Jazayeri, University of Lugano, Switzerland
Dino Mandrioli, Politecnico di Milano, Italy

Upcoming Important Date:

Thomas Streicher recently noted:

> omega + 1 is an infinite countable Ha which nevertheless
> is complete

True.  And the dual algebra {0} + omega* with the descending copy
integers is also a complete Ha (cHa).

But this second example, which is non-atomic, is not fully non-atomic;
that is, there are minimal gaps in the ordering.

Take Q = rationals in [0,1].  This is a countable, non-complete Ha,
where between any two distinct elements there is a third.

Note that all these Ha's are subalgebras of the unit interval [0,1]
of all reals -- which is uncountable, of course.  In linearly ordered
Ha's, the implication b --> c == c if b > c, and is 1 otherwise.  It
follows that the not-not stable elements are just 0 and 1.

As I remarked once before, it is an old theorem that all countable,
non-atomic Boolean algebras are isomorphic.  Call this Boolean algebra
F for free, for short.  This isomorphism theorem is far from true for
Ha's, however.

Take the algebra Q x Q.  This is a fully non-atomic, but it has FOUR
not-not stable elements = {0,1} x {0,1}.  So this is not the algebra
Q.  Take any other finite power, Q x Q x ... x Q.  They are all
different
by reference to the not-not stable elements.

The Ba I called F has a recursive structure (as one sees from what
we know about propositional calculus) in that all the operations
are recursive in terms of a simple enumeration of the elements of
F.  The question I want to consider is what countable Ha extend F
in such a way F equals the not-not stable elements.

Now, F can also be considered as the clopens of the Cantor space
2^N.  The cHa of all opens is fully non-atomic, but it is uncountable.
Call it C for Cantor.  The not-not stable elements of C are the so-
called
regular open sets.  They form an uncountable cBa which is the completion
of F.  But we want to ask if there are there interesting countable
subalgebras of C?  We note that elements of C are determined by the
elements of F they contain.  (In fact, the cHa C is isomorphic to the
lattice of ideals of F.)

Here is one construction.  Let A be the arithmetically definable
elements of C.  That is, take the elements of x of C where the
set {a in F | a =< x } is (first-order) arithmetically definable
(in terms of the enumeration of F).  I claim that A is a Ha.
Of course it contains F; and, if it is a subalgebra of C, then the
not-not stable elements give us an extension of F.  But it is
countable and the extension of F, call it G, is non-atomic; hence,
the stable elements of A form a Ba G isomorphic to F.

To check the subalgebra part we note for x,y in C and a in F:

	a =< x /\ y  <==>  a =< x & a =< y;

	a =< x \/ y  <==>  (for some b,c in F)[ a = b \/ c &
                             b =< x & c =< y ].

Hence, if x,y are in A, then so are x /\ y and x \/ y.

At first I had thought the recursively enumerable opens would
be enough, but there is trouble with negation.  We have for x in C
and a in F, and with -x notating negation in C:

	a =< -x  <==> (for all b in F)[ b =< x ==> a /\ b = 0 ].

The universal quantifier seems needed, and so {a in F | a =< -x }
does not seem to be r.e. in general.  But, if x is in A, then so
is -x.

We need to generalize this remark to implication in C, so for a in F
and x,y in C:

	a =< x --> y  <==> (for all b in F)[ b =< x ==> a /\ b =< y ].

Hence, if x,y are in A, then so is x --> y. And A is a sub-Ha of C.

Note that in A, if an element x is not 0, than the interval [0,x] in A
is in itself a non-Boolean cHa (a homomorphic image of A).

Consider next the algebra A x F.  This algebra is a countable, fully
non-atomic Ha.  The not-not stable elements of A come out to be
G x F, which is isomorphic to F (and G).  But, the element x = (0,1)
has the interval [0,x] in A x F isomorphic to F.  And that is
Boolean.  So, A and A x F are NOT isomorphic.

Note, however, that A x F and (A x F) x F ARE isomorphic.  Also, as
I forgot to mention, A and A x A are isomorphic.  Anyway, we have
at least two non-isomorphic, non-Boolean Ha's with an isomorph of F
as the not-not stables.  And they are fully non-atomic.

Are there other, non-isomorphic extensions of F?  At this moment
I do not see a knock-down argument.  One idea, is to call the above
algebra A_1 (for first-order definable opens) and consider the algebras
A_n of n-th order definable opens.  I think we get the same conclusions
about A_n and A_n x F not being isomorphic, BUT is every A_n somehow
isomorphic to A_1 (with a highly non-recursive automorphism of F)?
Is that possible, or have I missed an obvious point?

If the A_n are all not isomorphic, then we can probably get an
uncountable collection of mutually non-isomorphic extensions of F.

And, how would these relate to Sub(1) Ha's of countable topoi?
Or are these considerations a red herring?

Woke up in the middle of the night and realized I said
something obviously wrong.  (Not the first time, and
won't be the last, I'm afraid.)

Well, it is true that the stable elements of C form the completion of
F.  And, every element of C is a sup of elements of F, so C is atomless
in the sense of having no minimal non-zero elements.  And, the stables
of C form an atomless cBa.  BUT -- and here is my oversight -- C does
have gaps, and so the cHa is NOT fully non-atomic.

Think of the Cantor set as a subspace T of the unit interval.  There
is a blank from 1/3 to 2/3, if we make the construction via the
middle-third process.  This means that [0,1/3) meet T is open in T,
but [0,1/3] meet T = [0,2/3) meet T is both open and closed.  This
gives a gap between two opens in the cHa C.  So C is not fully gapless.
This gap also exists in the subalgebra A of arithmetically definable
opens.   Aarrgghh.

Is there a fix?  Can we take a quotient in the category of Ha's that
closes the gaps?  Maybe, and maybe not.  In countable Ba's, dividing
by the ideal generated by the atoms can result in a quotient algebra
that still has atoms.   Aarrgghh!

I will have to think further.  Rats!

The phrase "fully non-atomic" was not well chosen.  Let us use
"atomless"
to mean "no minimal non-zero elements", and let us say a Ha is "gapless"
if we cannot have elements a < b with [a, b] = {a, b} (i.e. nothing
strictly between).  An atomless Ba is always gapless.

Now the cHa C above, as I pointed out in the previous message, DOES
have gaps, even though it is atomless.  (The Ba F is atomless, and
it generates C by taking unions of clopen sets to make opens.  Thus,
no open set could be an atom in C.)

Take any point t in the Cantor set 2^N.  Let b = 2^N and let
a = 2^N \ {t}.  Clearly, a is a dense open set and [a, b] is a gap.
By removing one pont at a time, we can have a whole sequence of
dense open sets a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_n with each [a_i, a_(i+1)]
being a gap.  Note that negation in C gives --a_i = b, since
in topological lattices double negation is interior-of-closure.

In general, in any Ha which F generates, if a < b and [a, b] is a
gap, then b =< --a.  Because if not, then b /\ -a is non-zero.  By
the generation, there must be a non-zero e in F with e =< b /\ -a.
Thus, e /\ a = 0.  Because F is atomless, we can write e = f \/ g,
with two disjoint, non-zero elements of F.  But then c = a \/ f
is an element strictly between a and b.

This comment shows that gaps, if they exist are somewhat limited.
But, C has many gaps, and in general an interval [a, --a] might
be quite large.  Remember, assuming a = --a for all a makes
the Ha Boolean.

So, I have not really made much progress in answering how F
might generate a countable, non-boolean Ha.  I am guessing there
are many non-isomorphic ways this can happen.
