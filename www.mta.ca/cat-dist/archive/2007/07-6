Dear Marta,

Congratulations on the success of your campaign to get Elsevier to
withdraw from the arms trade.  However, I do not understand what
use I am supposed to make of this news.

If you tell your child that s/he will not get any chocolate cake
until s/he tidies his/her bedroom, and then s/he does so, you are
obliged to provide the chocolate cake.

Are you now saying that Elsevier was just a naughty child, whom
we loved all along really, and that we should start "publishing"
(ie privatising) our papers in their expensive journals?

It seems to me that the discussion on this list on this issue around
Christmas completely failed to address the main point of the journals
issue. Well, it nearly got there, but it was at just that point that
Bob cut it off.

The problem lies with the academic establishment, starting from
professors like you who are editors of journals, organisers of
conferences or heads of department, through the managements of
universities, up to the ministers of education in our respective
countries.  These are the people who hold the guns to our heads
while companies like Elsevier rob us of our intellectual property.

If certain of my colleagues want to set up new open-access on-line
journals in topology or whatever subject, then I strongly welcome
that, and am willing to help if they ask me to do so.

However, this does not solve the problem of the pressure that is
put on us by our lords and masters, especially when they specify
lists of "approved" journals, or employ - inherently fraudulent -
methods of bibliometry to "assess" our work.

Best wishes,
Paul

Dear Bas Spitters

The first application of this notion of distribution
to be carried out in detail is to singular coverings
in the sense of Fox ("spreads"). This application
and the necessary basics are well described in

Singular Coverings of Toposes
Series: Lecture Notes in Mathematics , Vol. 1890
Bunge, M., Funk, J.
2006, XII, 225 p

Projected applications to model theory have not
yet been carried out to my knowledge.

Note that this notion of distribution is "on" a topos
and is rather canonical. Distribution theory "in" a
cohesive topos is needed for continuum physics
and is hoped to enjoy certain simplications relative
to traditional treatments based on contravariant
descriptions of cohesion, because of the
unique existence of map spaces.

Sincerely
F William Lawvere

The problems to which Paul refers in his last paragraph seem to me to rest
partly in a lack of analysis by the general mathematical community (and in
this I tend to exclude category theorists who as part of their trade do
analyse directions and foundations) of how mathematics progresses. I make
some remarks on this in a recent article `Promoting Mathematics' in MSOR
Connections Vol 7 No 2
downloadable from http://mathstore.gla.ac.uk/articles/new.asp, and an
analysis of the Research Assessment Exercise Methodology is given on
www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/publar.html
The problem seems to be partly that the great and the good go along with the
idea that they can decide which mathematics of today will play a key role in
the future, and therefore there should be funding direction to those
`important' trends.
Paul Adrian Dirac said in one of his last addresses that `You should follow
a mathematical idea wherever it leads, however far from the original
starting point'. Indeed it seems reasonable to say that a professional
methodology is to follow through one's ideas in this way. Many, or some,  of
the  great and the good, however,  will take  opportunities  to use words
like `rubbish' and `nonsense' and to criticise work from a sociological
viewpoint:
Are important others following you?
Is it relevant to the `mainstream'?
They have not realised the `mainstream' flaps around like the sail on a
yacht (to mix metaphors). A visitor to Bangor in 2001 said to me `You are
not mainstream.' I retorted `Not yet!'.  My impression is that the great and
the good in the UK have not heard of the word `pioneering', and are unaware
of the history of important mathematical ideas. Indeed they are quite
prepared to leave out the words `category' and `groupoid' from an evaluation
of 20th century mathematics. (I name no names.) Perhaps this all part of the
fight for funding, and for Governments to prove that money is `well spent'.
For an individual outside a `top centre', the best bet might be to look for
`childish questions'  (Grothendieck) which the `top centres' ignore. The
history of science shows the hazards of this approach for individuals! There
are sociological reasons for this!

Part of my argument is also that mathematicians need to argue strongly for
their subject, not just for its applications. My friend John Robinson was
proud of his last sculpture donation of `Prometheus', to Frome Community
College, and the giving of the name `Prometheus' to their new Mathematics
Centre.
www.fromecollege.somerset.sch.uk/
See also
http://www.popmath.org.uk/sculpture/pages/2hearth.html

That was John's view of the contribution of mathematics to humanity!

Anyone want to argue against it? Or elaborate it?

Ronnie

Dear colleagues:

After thinking about it, I cannot restrain myself from responding to
Ross's message that the procedings of CT07 will be published by Applied
Categorical Structures.  What I say here is what I would do.  I cannot
recommend what other people should do (especially people without tenure,
who are in a peculiar position).

I am not going to CT07 (I cannot face crossing the pond in sardine class)
nor am I planning to publish a paper in the proceedings.  But if I were, I
would certainly not publish it in ACS.  The proceedings of the Kleislifest
in 2000 were published by ACS but my paper went into TAC.

ACS is published by Kluwer (now a subsidary of Springer).  Kluwer is one
of the "gang of five"  publishers that are sucking all the life (not to
mention money) out of mathematical publication.  The journal is not
subscribed to by McGill nor by any other university in Montreal.  I would
actually be surprised if any university in Canada or more than a small
handful in the US subscribe.  It is no wonder since they charge, as far as
I can tell, in the neighbourhood of $3 a page so that the annual
subscription of nearly 100 pages costs nearly $3000.  The author of a
paper published there is legally enjoined from posting it on his own web
site.  What a perversion of the whole idea of intellectual property (a
somewhat dubious concept in any case, especially the way it is practiced
today).  Imagine, we do all the work, they make all the profit, and then
tell us we cannot distribute it freely.

When I publish, my interests are served best by the widest possible
distribution.  If it is category theory, that means TAC.  (Unfortunately,
my most recent work has been in point-set topology, which has no such
alternative.)  TAC is freely (in both senses) available and leaves the
intellectual property where it belongs, with the author.  But even if TAC
is unsuitable for your work, there are reasonable alternatives.  Two of my
recent papers have been published in the Canadian Journal and one in an
inexpensive Japanese journal.  Even tenure committees might be impressed
by those places.  Of course, nothing I do would ever be acceptable in
"prestige" journals, but that gets into issues that Ronnie Brown has
recently expressed better than I can.

Well said Mike!
Years ago, when we sent type-written material to the journals most of
them "added value" by typesetting. About the time we began texing our
own papers, journals became prohibitively expensive. Now, many of them
subtract value by introducing errors when they reset to a house style
and by limiting the author's readership. Most mathematical societies'
journals are still good value but surely commercial journals cannot last
much longer? (Dalhousie subscribed to Applied Categorical Structures from
1998 to 2003.)

In honour of Jean-Yves Girard on the occasion of his 60th birthday
year, a Festschrift will be published as a special issue of
Theoretical Computer Science, where the "Linear Logic" paper was
published twenty years ago.

The Festschrift follows the two events organized in Siena
(http://www.unisi.it/eventi/LOGIC/) and in Paris
(http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/jyg60/) this year.

Submissions for this special issue are welcome from all the
participants to the workshops as well as from other contributors.

Indeed!  It's a pity that the proceedings of the main international
conference on category theory is going to be buried in this journal.

Why not publish it in TAC?

Is that still true?  If so, that's terrible.  Even most Reed-Elsevier
journals allow you to keep your papers on your own website - and more
importantly, on the mathematics arXiv.

However, Reed-Elsevier only officially accepted these practices recently.
Before that, it worked like this: if you demanded the right to keep your
paper on the arXiv, they'd give in and let you do it.  I think they were
trying to avoid public battles, to keep from looking bad.

So, if anybody feels compelled to publish in a Springer/Kluwer/Reed-Elsevier
journal for some reason, they should simply refuse to give away the
complete electronic rights to their papers.  If necessary, amend the copyright
form to say you have the right to keep your article on your website and
the arXiv.  Journals are unlikely to turn away papers for this reason
after they've already been accepted for publication.

You can read the copyright transfer forms for some math journals here:

http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/journals#copyright

and many more here:

http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo.php

Unfortunately, the information about Springer seems a bit contradictory.

Best,
jb

I did not know that Elsevier had changed it policies in that regard.  I
did know that if you asked they would send you a different copyright
transfer form asking only for a permission to print, but you had to know
to ask for it and my last publication in PAA was a dozen years ago.  And a
colleague of mine got a "lawyer's letter" from some journal demanding that
he remove a paper from his own web site.

Although I am glad (I suppose) to hear that they have yielded on this
point, my basic objection remains.

It's always possible to put the ball back in any publisher's court
by using their form but crossing out anything objectinable.

Indeed, I have done this since 1995, and added, by hand, that I
reserve the right of posting the papers at my university web page for
scholarly purposes, with no objections by the publishers.

However, for my last paper, I was sent a copyright form, by IEEE, to
be electronically signed. There were no means of crossing things out
or adding my own clauses, and no options for printing the form and
faxing it! Moreover, there was a short deadline for signing it, on the
grounds that otherwise my paper wouldn't make it for the proceedings,
and hence no opportunity to negotiate.

Martin and all,

What I've done in the past is call the IEEE and talk to one of the
copyright people.  For conference proceedings, I've been told it's OK to
distribute and, as I recall, even to post the article as long as the IEEE
conference is cited.  I take the version that appears in the proceedings
and post that; it has the IEEE information toward the bottom of the title
page.  They would like you to call them first or notify them by mail of
what you want to do (some such statement used to appear on the electronic
copyright form---I haven't looked at the most recent one).

Regards,
Mike

> However, for my last paper, I was sent a copyright form, by IEEE, to

> or adding my own clauses, and no options for printing the form and
> faxing it! Moreover, there was a short deadline for signing it, on the
> grounds that otherwise my paper wouldn't make it for the proceedings,

           UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD
         COMPUTING LABORATORY
        Programming Tools Group
Oxford University Computing Laboratory has a fully
funded three year research studentship working in
the Programming Tools Group with the abc team:
    http://progtools.comlab.ox.ac.uk
        http://aspectbench.org


PROJECT SUMMARY

Software systems are rarely written from scratch: they
evolve over long periods of time. When a change is
made, this often affects many different locations in a
system, and it is hard to make a change consistently.
For that reason, automated tools to help the process of
software change are desirable. "Refactoring" refers to
the process of restructuring an existing piece of
software, often prior to introducing new functionality, or to
take advantage of a new technology. Refactoring must
preserve the behaviour of existing code, and tools that
help in refactoring both assist in the restructuring
process and in checking that the behaviour has not
changed.

Unfortunately today's refactoring tools are very hard
to construct, they are still quite limited in functionality,
and they often contain bugs. This project aims to construct
a framework for better refactoring tools. In particular,
the work is driven by refactorings for a new set of
language features, called `aspect-oriented programming'
that have recently been added to Java.

Our framework will be based on developments in three
separate areas of computer science:
* "strategies" to control the process of rewriting program
  code, from the term rewriting community
* "reference attribute grammars" to specify the
  conditions that guarantee behaviour is preserved, from
  the compilers community
* "incremental evaluation" of declarative rules, from
  the functional and logic programming community.

The quality of our framework will be assessed by coding
selected case studies using alternative methods. In
particular, we shall implement several refactorings directly
in Eclipse, the leading development environment
for writing aspect-oriented programs in industry.

SELECTION CRITERIA

The PhD student will be concerned with the theoretical
foundations of the refactoring framework, for instance proofs
of correctness for refactorings, and also for the incremental
evaluation mechanism. We are thus looking for someone with
good mathematical skills, in particular regarding formal
properties of type systems and program analyses. Candidates
must have an outstanding undergraduate or master's degree in
computer science. More generally, candidates must satisfy
the usual requirements:

http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/prospective/dphil/dphil-criteria.pdf

for doing a doctorate at Oxford.

HOW TO APPLY

The deadline for applications has been extended to July 17,
2007, but earlier applications will be reviewed immediately,
so candidates are encouraged to apply as soon as possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------

August 20       CALCO-jnr, CALCO-tools
August 21-24    CALCO technical programme


CALCO'07 takes place at Grand Hotel Terminus in Bergen, one of many
historic hotels in Norway. The conference starts Monday with two workshops
followed by an official reception Monday evening.  The main program runs
Tuesday through Friday, each morning starting with an invited speaker.
Additional events are excursion by boat in the Bergen archipelago
(Wednesday afternoon) and conference dinner on one of the mountains
surrounding the city centre (Thursday afternoon).


Registration
------------
Registration fee is 3200 NOK (1200 NOK for students), with a noticeable
increase for late registration after July 1. The=20
fee includes the full conference
with all workshops, a copy of the proceedings, lunches and coffee breaks,
and the official reception Monday evening.

Registration is via the calco07 web site:
    http://www.ii.uib.no/calco07/

Note that Bergen is very busy during the tourist season, so early booking
of accommodation and transportation is strongly recommended.



Main CALCO'07 conference
------------------------
CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference. It brings together
researchers and practitioners to exchange new results related
to foundational aspects and both traditional and emerging uses of
algebras and coalgebras in computer science. The study of algebra
and coalgebra relates to the data, process and structural aspects of
software systems. The accepted papers report results of theoretical work
on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the way these results
can support methods and techniques for software development, as well as
experience with the transition of resulting technologies into industrial
practise. Some main key words are:

     * Abstract models and logics
     * Specialised models and calculi
     * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
     * System specification and verification

The list of accepted papers is available at the web site.

CALCO is Tuesday-Friday, 0900-1700, but ends at 1400 Friday.


Invited speakers
----------------
Stephen L. Bloom, Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ, USA

Luis Caires, New University of Lisbon, Portugal

Barbara K=F6nig, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany

Glynn Winskel, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom


CALCO-jnr (CALCO Young Researchers Workshop)
--------------------------------------------
CALCO-jnr is dedicated to presentations by PhD students and by those who
completed their doctoral studies within the past few years. This year
12 contributions within the theme of CALCO have been accepted. See the
overview on the CALCO-jnr web page on the CALCO web site.

CALCO-jnr is Monday 0900-1730.


CALCO-tools
-----------
CALCO-tools is dedicated to presentation and demonstration of
tools based on algebraic and coalgebraic principles. These include
systems/prototypes/tools developed specifically for design, checking,
execution, and verification of (co)algebraic specifications, but
also tools targeting different application domains but making core or
interesting use of (co)algebraic techniques. A Maude tool environment
and a coinductive prover will be showcased this year.

CALCO-tools is Monday 1530-1700.

I call to your atention the following yet unpublished papers:

1. arXiv:0706.1771 [ps, pdf, other]
    Title: The fundamental progroupoid of a general topos
    Authors: Eduardo J. Dubuc
    Comments: 19 pages
    Subjects: Category Theory (math.CT); Algebraic Topology (math.AT)

Here we introduce a new notion of covering projections in a topos E. Th=
ey
are a particular kind of locally constant objects. When the topos is
locally connected, all locally constant objects are covering projection=
s.
Given a fix cover U =3D {U_i}, we show how to construct the set of conn=
ected
components in the topos E_U of covering projections trivialized by U, e=
ven
if the topos E is not locally connected. Our theory generalize to an
arbritrary topos the whole theory of the fundamental progroupoid known =
for
locally connected topos.

The following two papers are in the area of categorical topology, or
topological categories.

I have put my slides for my CT2007 talk on my website
   www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/
partly for the benefit of those who asked me to, but mainly as an
encouragement to the other speakers, whose slides would be very
welcome to many of us who attended the meeting, and perhaps even more
welcome to those who didn't.  (Perhaps the organisers could set up a
page of slides, as was done for CT2006.)

Re the content of my own slides: I have added three slides from my
FMCS 2007 talk which show how the comonad S (or !) arises naturally
from the additive structure; together with a result we (B.C.S.) proved
during the CT2007 meeting, this goes a long way to answering (in the
affirmative) a question of Anders Kock as to whether the differential
structure in a differential category is "property" rather than
"structure".

If you are interested in this material you should look at our MSCS
paper "Differential Categories" (linked on my webpage, where you will
find my slides from my 2006 talks as well, which fill in more of the
story).

___________________________________________________________________

The 35th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and
Programming, the main conference and annual meeting of the European
Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), will take place
from the 6th to the 13th of July 2008 in Reykjavik, Iceland.

Following the successful experience of the last three editions, ICALP
2008 will complement the established structure of the scientific
program based on Track A on Algorithms, Automata, Complexity and
Games, and Track B on Logic, Semantics, and Theory of Programming,
corresponding to the two main streams of the journal Theoretical
Computer Science, with a special Track C on Security and Cryptography
Foundations. The aim of Track C is to allow a deeper coverage of a
particular topic, to be specifically selected for each year's edition
of ICALP on the basis of its timeliness and relevance for the
theoretical computer science community.

In addition to the main conference, ICALP 2008 will also feature pre-
and post-conference workshops on July 6, 12, and 13, 2008. A call for
workshop is now open, and details on the submission of workshop
proposals may be found at http://www.ru.is/icalp08/cfw.html.

An appreciation of John's work is published in=20

www.isama.org/hyperseeing

June 2007.=20

I have also published an I hope provocative article on `Promoting =
Mathematics' =20
in=20

MSOR Connections Vol 7, No 2, May 2007=20

downloadable from=20

http://mathstore.ac.uk/newsletter/may2007/pdf/24_brown_r_promotingmaths.p=
df

It has some Grothendieck quotations and a theme is promoting mathematics =
to students!  MSOR would I think welcome further debate and argument.=20
