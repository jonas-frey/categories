We remind you that

The 86th edition of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will =20=

be held at the  Institut =C9lie Cartan (IECN) on the  Universit=E9 Henri =
=20
Poincar=E9  campus in Nancy, France, on the weekend of September 8-9 =
2007.

http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/psslHomeEN.html

The preliminary schedule is now available at

http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/schedule.html


In the PSSL tradition, people arriving not too late Friday are =20
welcome at  Le Petit Cuny,  97 Grande Rue, where some of us will hang =20=

around starting at 7pm, to have drinks and sample the hearty local =20
(well, Alsatian) cuisine, in particular Flammekuche, our very own =20
answer to pizza. There will also be a banquet on Saturday evening for =20=

which those who want to attend will be asked a moderate sum.

Getting to the IECN

Take the tramway in the "CHU Brabois" direction and get off at the =20
"Callot" stop. If you are not directly next to it, you should find =20
Jacques Callot street behind the McDonald's. It leads to the entrance =20=

of the campus. There are two glass-and-steel structures in a similar =20
style, and the IECN is the one that will be to your right (the other, =20=

to your left, is the Loria , the computer science lab). Notice that =20
the entrance to the IECN itself is on the side of the building, =20
inside a small glass-enclosed lobby.

Details to keep in mind

     * The IECN, where PSSL will be held, is normally closed on =20
Saturdays. The head of the IECN has allowed the doors to be =20
automatically unlocked for the following periods: 8-10 and 12-14 on =20
Saturday, and 8-10 on Sunday. If you want to enter the premises =20
outside these hours, please make sure someone is inside to open the =20
door for you.
     * Saturday lunch will be on the premises. You will be given more =20=

information on the Saturday banquet Saturday.
     * You are reminded that there is only one tram every 20 minutes =20
on Sundays. Please look up the schedule before you hit the road =20
Sunday morning.

Dear categorists,

The following paper, in which perhaps some of you might have an
interest, is now available:

"Homotopy theoretic models of identity types" by Steve Awodey and
Michael A. Warren

Abstract:

"This paper presents a novel connection between homotopical algebra
and mathematical logic.  It is shown that a form of intensional type
theory is valid in any Quillen model category, generalizing the
Hofmann-Streicher groupoid model of Martin-Loef type theory."

The paper may be found on the arXiv as 0709.0248v1 (math.LO):

<http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0248>

Michael Warren

I'm not sure I agree with that: internal groupoids, at the very least,
show up in a variety of situations which non-category theorists can be,
and are, interested in.  Perhaps one of the reasons why some people try
to deal with groupoids as if they weren't a special case of categories
is because they never thought of categories in any other way than as a=20
mass of hom-sets.

Now I do think there is a good reason for this, which is the fact=20
that in functorial semantics (by which I don't just mean the original,=20
universal-algebraic, case), the domain category is typically small.
Raising to a small power does not destroy local smallness.

I agree with this entirely, of course.  It follows that, in a first=20
course on category theory, one should present both styles of definition=20
as soon as possible.  This, in turn, suggests (but does not prove) that=20
one should not sweep size distinctions under the carpet. =20

Heh... I'm studying the same problem as a part of my Master Thesis (under
supervision of prof. Andrzej Tarlecki), but fortunately :-) in a bit
different framework. The chief concept of my work is a definition of a
category ("elementary category") in a fibred monoidal category (i.e. each
fibre is monoidal and reindexing functors preserve the monoidal structure)
over a base category with binary products. Than, roughly speaking, for a
category C with finite limits, C-enriched categories are just "Fam :
Fam(C) -> Set"-elementary categories, and C-internal categories are just
"Cod : C^{->} -> C"-elementary categories. It turns out (if I didn't make
mistakes :-)), that when C has Set-indexed coproducts, than there is an
adjunction between the global section functor C(1, -) : Cod -> Fam and the
"coproduct functor" \coprod_{-}(1) : Fam -> Cod. Furthermore, if the
coproducts are universal, than these functors are fibred and preserves the
monoidal structures, and if additionally all global sections in C are
disjoint (i.e. the pullback of two different global section is an initial
object) than this adjunction is an equivalence of categories (these results
give us approximations C-internal categories ---> C-enriched categories and
in the other direction).

I think it's not that.

It's just because the concept of internal category is in some sense subsumed
by the concept of fibration. And in practical situations we prefer to work
with fibrations rather than internal categories.

What do you mean by "you get internal/enriched categories" ? Do you have a
2-equivalence between the 2-category of all S-internal (resp. enriched)
categories (S-internal functors, S-internal natural transformations) and the
2-category of your categories ? I'm asking because I have encountered some
difficulties here (i.e. in my framework some diagrams are not willing to
commute "on the nose").

STATEMENT OF THE EDITORS OF THE "JOURNAL OF K-THEORY"

After several public statements and news articles
regarding the Springer journal "K-Theory" (KT),
and the new "Journal of K-Theory" (JKT) to be
distributed by Cambridge University Press (CUP),
the mathematical community has become aware of
ongoing changes. On behalf of the entire
Editorial Board of the new JKT, we want to give
as precise a picture of the situation as we can
at the moment, especially to the authors.

It is very important to us that the authors
should not suffer as a result of the transition.
Those authors who submitted papers to KT before
August 2007, regardless of whether the paper has
already been accepted or is just awaiting review,
have three choices:
1) Choose another journal.
2) Maintain submission with KT for final review
if necessary and publication if accepted.
3) Transfer their article to the new JKT.

All authors who have not yet done so should
please notify Professor Bak on the one hand,
Professors Lueck and Ranicki on the other hand,
about their choice, as soon as possible.  For
those who opt for choice #2, Professors Lueck and
Ranicki have promised to take over the remaining
editorial duties.
We can guarantee that the authors who choose
option (3) will have a smooth transition, with
their articles progressing as if there has been
no change. We will also do everything we can to
help those who choose options (1) and (2). In
particular, if the authors instruct us, we will
be happy to forward to the journals of their
choice the full information regarding the status
of their articles.

In 2004, because of growing dissatisfaction with
Springer, the editorial board of KT authorized
Prof. Anthony Bak, the Editor in Chief, to begin
negotiations with other publishers. The editorial
board was unhappy with the poor quality of the
work done by Springer, for example the huge
number of misprints in the published version of
the articles, the long delay in publication and
the high prices Springer was charging.
The negotiations came to a conclusion in 2007. A
new journal, entitled "Journal of K-theory" (JKT)
will commence publication in late 2007. It will
be printed by Cambridge University Press. Papers
will appear earlier online, as 'forthcoming
articles'.

The title of JKT is currently owned by a private
company. This situation is only meant as a
temporary solution to restart publication of
K-theory articles as soon as possible. It is the
Board's intention to create a non-profit academic
foundation and to transfer ownership of JKT to
this foundation, as soon as possible, but no
later than by the end of 2009, a delay justified
by many practical considerations.

This shift towards more academic control of
journals is not new. We follow here a path opened
by Compositio Mathematica, Commentarii
Mathematici Helvetici, and others (see for
instance the interesting paper of Gerard van der
Geer which appeared in the Notices of the AMS in
May 2004). We believe that such changes can help
keep prices low.

We trust in Prof. Bak's leadership for the
launching of JKT and forming,  together with the
editorial board, the foundation to house the
Journal. The statutes of the foundation will
provide democratic rules governing the future
course and development of the journal, including
the election of the managing team.

We hope to have provided a fair picture of the
current situation, and we plan to issue another
public statement when new developments come up.
In case of further questions, please contact any
of the signatories.

Let us conclude from a broader perspective: The
editorial board is committed to secure the
journal's quality and long-term sustainability.

One would like to leave students with a very positive attitude. The
following quotation , from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,  might
help:
" Category theory has come to occupy a central position in contemporary
mathematics and theoretical computer science, and is also applied to
mathematical physics. ......."
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory/

I am writing as someone who has come into category theory from algebraic
topology, and been struck by the utility of the language and results for
what I needed over the years (and by the welcome).

A separate matter, but intriguingly related,  is categories and groupoids as
sources of useful algebraic structures. This seems connected with the notion
of partial operations, and so my notion of `higher dimensional group theory'
and `higher dimensional algebra' is that of  studying algebraic structures
with partial operations defined under geometric conditions.  This concurs
with the vision in
Higgins, Philip J. Algebras with a scheme of operators.  Math. Nachr. 27
1963 115--132.
In this view, the objects of a category play a key role.
This has covered the developments I had in mind for modelling some
underlying structures in homotopy theory, and which were developed with
Philip Higgins, and later with Loday. Relevant was Philip's reporting of the
view of Philip Hall that one should study the algebra that arises naturally
from the geometry without trying to force the algebra  into a preconceived
mould.

In the late 1960s, when Bill Cockcroft and I received notes from Saunders of
lectures on category theory for our comments, Bill and I replied that what
we really wanted was `Categories for the working mathematician'. I still
hold to that. To me this means general theory with specific examples which
show how the general theory makes life easier, even controls the
calculations. Eilenberg insisted a construction should be defined, and its
properties developed, in terms of the universal property, which should also
explain existence.

So when dealing with structures at various levels it is very useful to know
left adjoints commute with colimits, right adjoints commute with limits, and
this can tell one how to compute colimits and limits. This also leads to
induced constructions (change of base).

I have  recently found  uses (to me!)  of fibrations of categories: the
inclusion of a fibre preserves connected colimits. Simple examples of the
use of this are:
Ob: Groupoids \to Sets,
forget: (groupoid modules) \to groupoids;
forget: (2-Cat) \to Cat
and compositions of these.
Of course it was generalisations of the van Kampen theorem to higher
dimensions, and the (previously rare) use in homotopy theory of colimits of
algebraic structures,  that made it useful to do such computations.

I have only recently really understood the notion of dense subcategory, and
its use for representing an object as a coend.

What I have not done is use the theory of monads. Is this ignorance on my
part? I am happy to be enlightened!

One of the points of a course for the students might be `need to know'.
Hence the need for explicit  and varied examples. How to balance this with
theory?

I'm not sure I agree with that: internal groupoids, at the very least,
show up in a variety of situations which non-category theorists can be,
and are, interested in.  Perhaps one of the reasons why some people try
to deal with groupoids as if they weren't a special case of categories
is because they never thought of categories in any other way than as a
mass of hom-sets.

Now I do think there is a good reason for this, which is the fact
that in functorial semantics (by which I don't just mean the original,
universal-algebraic, case), the domain category is typically small.
Raising to a small power does not destroy local smallness.

I agree with this entirely, of course.  It follows that, in a first
course on category theory, one should present both styles of definition
as soon as possible.  This, in turn, suggests (but does not prove) that
one should not sweep size distinctions under the carpet.

I look forward to it!

My guess would be that it's because for non-category theorists, many
(perhaps most) categories which arise in practice are enriched (over
something more exotic than Set), while few are internal (to something
more exotic than Set).  Even when working over Set, I think it's fair
to say that the vast majority of categories arising in mathematical
practice are locally small.

Since in general, neither enriched nor internal category theory is a
special case of the other, it doesn't seem justified to me to consider
either one as "more primitive".  However, it's worth pointing out that
both are a special case of categories enriched in a bicategory, or in
a double category.

Actually, currently my favorite level of generality is something I
call a "monoidal fibration".  Roughly, the idea is that you have two
different "base" categories, S and V, such that the object-of-objects
comes from S while the object-of-morphisms comes from V.  When S and V
are the same, you get internal categories, and when S=Set, you get
classical enriched categories.  This could be regarded as "explaining"
the coincidence of internal and enriched categories for V=Set.  I
wrote a bit about this at the end of "Framed Bicategories and Monoidal
Fibrations" (arXiv:0706.1286), but I intend to say more in a
forthcoming paper.

If similarity geometry means similarity-invariant geometry, what are its
objects?  Google has a lot to say about similarity spaces, none of it
relevant to similarity invariance.

Sticking to finite dimensions, a Euclidean space is standardly defined
as an inner product space over the reals.  As such it has predicates
recognizing those line segments of unit length, and those lines passing
through the origin, neither of which I remember from Euclid, who seems
rather to be writing about similarity geometry.

Euclid does however talk about right triangles and line segments of
equal length (and equal angles but that follows from the other two).  So
clearly Euclid is doing more than just affine geometry.

If Euclid's plane is not the Euclidean plane, what is it?  If Euclid was
doing similarity geometry it should be called a similarity space
(certainly not a vector space or a Euclidean space or an affine space or
a projective space or a metric space or a topological space).  If it's
called something else what is it?  If Euclid was doing some other kind
of geometry than similarity geometry what kind was it?

A transcript of the slides for my CT200t invited talk (with minor
revisions and added references) is now available from

         <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/latest.html>  .

The papers on `Differential Structure in Models of Multiplicative

Funny you should ask this just as I was trying to find a satisfying
answer to this question.  Now we are so accustomed that an Euclidean
space has some orthonormal system plonked down somewhere in it,
or that it has at least a fixed origin and the scalar product that
defines lengths and angles.  But, like Eve and Adam were created
without navels, Euclid's space was created without an origin; also
it was created completely flat (with curvature 0 in modern lingo),
so that there is no 'canonical' unit of length; and it was created
withot a priory orientation.  But you can measure one line segment
with another in it, you can also mesure angles, and you can _choose_
one of the two possible orientations and call it positive.
To capture all this I cooked up some structure; you decide if it
does the job.

First, an Euclid's space (let's call it that, to avoid confusing it
with an Euclidean space) is a real affine space (V,P), where
V is a real vector space of _vectors_ in the space, and P is the set
of its _points_.  There are also two operations +: P >< V -> P and
-: P >< P -> V; the first is an action of the additive group of V on P,
so it satisfies a + 0 = a and (a + u) + v  = a + (u + v) for all
points a and all vectors u, v.  Moreover, the two operations are
'local inverses' of each other in the sense that (a + u) - a = u and
a + (b - a) = b for all points a, b and all vectors u.  This definition
eliminates the need for an a priory origin.  To make life easier,
assume V is finite dimensional.

Morphism (V,P) -> (U,Q) of affine spaces is a pair of maps
h: V -> U and f: P -> Q, where h is a linear map and
f(a + v) = f(a) + h(v) for all points a in P and all vectors v in V.

Now, the metric of the Euclid's space.  There are positive-definite
(symmetric bilinear) forms on V.  Call two such forms similar if they
differ by a constant positive factor; a similarity class is therefore
a ray (open half-line with the endpoint the zero form) in the space
of all symmetric bilinear forms on V.  Now consider the structure
E = (V, P, m), where (V,P) is a real affine space and m is a similarity
class of positive-definite forms on V: this is my proposed structure
of Euclid's space.

Let S be the group of all automorphisms (h,f) of the affine space
(V,P) that preserve m:  for every g in m, g(h(u),h(v)) = c g(u,v)
for some positive constant c (depending on h, not depending on u and v)
and all vectors u, v.  These are the similarity trasformations of E,
defining the similarity geometry of E.  If A is any structure built
from vectors and points (and lines etc) in E, then the orbit of A
under S is the object studied in this geometry.

Let R be the group of all automorphisms (h,f) of the affine space
(V,P) that preserve some form in m, and therefore preserve
_every_ form in m: g(h(u),h(v)) = g(u,v) for all g in m and all
vectors u, v.  This is the group of rigid motions of E.

Orientation: if dim V = n, then there is a one-dimensional
space of alternating n-linear forms on V; choosing one of the
two rays (half-lines with the endpoint at the zero form) in this
space chooses the orientation.

Some helpful discussion with Dana Scott and Fred Linton got me to the
point where I felt I could say reasonably succinctly exactly what a
Euclidean space is (or ought to be).  The following summarizes my
present understanding, which is a lot clearer than 24 hours ago.

I've seen only two essentially different approaches so far, bottom-up
(adding structure) and top-down (forgetting structure).

Bottom-up:

     A Euclidean space is
     an affine space transformable only by similarities.

Since affine spaces are already understood to be transformable only by
affinities, the further restriction to similarities is equivalent to the
preservation of circles, or of right isosceles triangles.  Affine spaces
are in turn definable as an affine-closed subspace of a projective space
transformable only by affinities.

Constraining the morphisms in this way is morally equivalent to adding
structure (of some unspecified kind), whence "bottom-up".

Top-down:

     A Euclidean space is
     a torsor for a Euclidean inner product space E.

A torsor, or principal homogeneous space, is (in this instance) a
generalized metric space with vector distances in place of real
distances so as to make the triangle inequality an equality, with d(x,y)
= -d(y,x) and d(x,y) = 0 iff x = y.  Like metric spaces torsors have no
origin.  E supplies the distances.  I put "Euclidean" as a modifier for
"inner product space" to connote the liberalization of morphisms thereof
to preserving inner product only up to a constant factor (as opposed to
the presumed default of on the nose).  This liberalization accommodates
scaling, and can be considered as forgetting the scale.  That and
torsors for forgetting the origin makes this approach "top-down."

I've used both approaches in software for things like surveying and
computer graphics, using respectively top-down and bottom-up.  Top-down
is simple at a low level, is primarily vector oriented, involves little
or no multiplication, and works fine with single-precision floating
point or even fixed point arithmetic.  Bottom-up is simple at a high
level (if you don't try to follow the individual arithmetic steps when
debugging), uses an extra dimension to express projective geometry
(needed to represent the part at infinity dropped when passing to affine
space), is primarily matrix oriented, involves lots of multiplication,
and benefits from double precision.  All high-end video cards today use
bottom-up exclusively, understandable for rendering which needs
projective rather than Euclidean geometry, but its benefits for rigid
solid modeling over top-down are less clear to me, though for
articulated solid modeling bottom-up seems preferable.

What other approaches to defining Euclidean space have been proposed?

Dear Vaughan,

I too thought about torsors, but couldn't see round the problem that
they fix a unit length. (Suppose E is an inner product space and X a
torsor for it, then for any x, y in X there is a unique v in E taking x
to y, and so the length of v gives the distance from x to y.) Does
"liberalizing the morphisms" in the way you suggest really do the trick?
That seems to require a new notion of torsor, and I can't see how it
would work technically.

Regards,

Steve.

Categorically-minded,

Is there a notion of prime monad where the notion of (de-)composition is
adjoint situation? For example, are there monads such that the only adjoint
situations giving rise to them are the Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore algebras?

Best wishes,

Where does Euclid's approach fit in this scheme?  Starting from say Hilbert's
formulation of Euclidean geometry it is certainly possible to get to an inner
product space and all the rest, but it's certainly not direct and not easy.

Dear Colleagues,

The artificial choice of unit of length=20
should indeed be avoided in fundamental
considerations since, among other things,
it trivializes the relation between length &
area, etc.

Over a given rig R, a Euclidean space E seems
to be
1) a torsor over an R-module V where V
is equipped with=20
2) an isomorphism=20
         V->Hom(V, L)
3) where L is an invertible R-module.

The fact  that L itself has no given rig structure
can be compared with the general idea of
metric (TAC Reprints 1) as valued in a monoidal
category (which has one covariant binary operation,
NOT two.)

The R-modules R, L, L@L, etc, may be=20
non-isomorphic, and there may even be=20
other invertibles corresponding to time, force, etc.
However, this Picard group will have all its elements
of order two (i.e.,each invertible module will have
its own R-valued pairing) if R is real in the sense
that a sum of several squares is invertible if one of them=20
is (as shown a few years ago by Steve Schanuel).
That result is for the category of abstract sets,
destroying my hope that the free abelian group on
three generators might occur for a suitable spatial
topos of affine algebraic geometry.

Of course, a unit of M, where M is an invertible=20
module, should be an isomorphism R->M, but=20
in general such isomorphisms exist only locally.

To see nontrivial invertible modules, look at
classical arithmetic or complex analysis, or in
the present geometric vein, look at rigs and R-modules
not in abstract sets, but in more cohesive or variable
toposes. Garrett Birkhoff recommended the topos of
G-sets for a certain group G of homogeneities,=20
obtaining (in a rather tautological way) the result=20
that the group of dimensional analysis occurs as a=20
Picard group.

Looking forward to your thoughts
Bill

Fred,

Thanks. My 'intuition' is that there are some adjoint decompositions that
genuinely reveal internal structure of the monad and others that ... make no
such disclosure ;-). But, perhaps i can disabuse myself of this with some
application to calculation.

Best wishes,

NOt even the identity monad on SETS has this property, as it is
the adjunction monad also for the adjoint pair =


[underlying pointset]: [topological spaces] --> SETS ,
[discrete topology on]: SETS --> [topological spaces] .

There ARE a few monads for which the Kleisli and E-M categories
"coincide," however, beyond the identity monads. First example
coming to mind is the FreeVectorSpace monad on SETS. I'm sure
other Categories-readers will point out more.

> would work technically.

I don't know if it's a new notion, but the following construction of
what I'll call Aff(C), the affinitization (affination?) of C, should
work for any category C concrete over Ab  via a faithful functor
U: C --> Ab.  (Ab(Z,-): Ab --> Set automatically makes Ab concrete over
Set.)  The subcategories of Vct_k we've been talking about, in
particular Euc with origin but liberal morphisms, are all instances of
such a C.  If this is different from torsors I'd appreciate some insight
into the difference.

Definition:

Take the objects of Aff(C) to be those of C.  A morphism in Aff(C) from
c to d is a pair (h, m) where m: c --> d is a morphism of C and
h: U(c) --> U(d) is any group homomorphism such that

     h(x) - h(y)  =  U(m)(x - y)    for all x, y in U(c).

End definition.

The effect of this construction is to make the objects of Aff(c)
generalized metric spaces.  Reading between the lines of the above, an
implicit metric D(x, y) is given by the group structure in the form
x + D(x, y) = y, or equivalently D(x, y) = y - x; there is no need to
make D explicit with its own symbol.

All four Frechet axioms follow after modifying them to make the triangle
inequality an equality and D(x, y) = -D(y, x) (symmetry becomes
antisymmetry).  The morphism (h, m) maps the points of the metric space
via h subject to coherently (over the whole space) maintaining the
distance with m.

That should do it for Euc.  France Dacar did things in the other order:
torsor first, liberate from scale second.  I guess they commute ... but:

To be sure we've been talking about the same category Euc of what France
called Euclid's spaces, for the Euc I have in mind, Euc(E_m,E_n) has
(m+1)n - (m+1 choose 2) + 1 degrees of freedom when 1 <= m <= n.
Outside that range Euc(E_m,E_n) has n degrees of freedom, with rigidity
obliging E_m for m > n to collapse to E_0.  When m = n > 0 this reduces
to 1 + n + (n choose 2), corresponding to the one dilatation, n
translations, and rotation group of order (n choose 2) = n(n-1)/2 in
E_n.  Here's a table.

.    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
-----------------------------------------
0 |  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
1 |  0   2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18
2 |  0   1   4   7  10  13  16  19  22  25
3 |  0   1   2   7  11  15  19  23  27  31
4 |  0   1   2   3  11  16  21  26  31  36
5 |  0   1   2   3   4  16  22  28  34  40
6 |  0   1   2   3   4   5  22  29  36  43
7 |  0   1   2   3   4   5   6  29  37  45
8 |  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  37  46
9 |  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  46

In contrast Aff_R(A_m,A_n) (affine spaces) has (m+1)n degrees of
freedom, while Vct_R(V_m,V_n) (vector spaces) has mn.

If Euler invented affine geometry as being somehow cleaner than
Euclidean geometry he was going in the right direction, with vector
spaces making things simpler yet via familiar mxn matrices.

Regarding Bob Knighten's question on approaches to synthetic Euclidean
geometry such as Hilbert's axiomatization, has anyone axiomatized more
than E_3 (Euclid Books 11-13)?  A satisfactory definition of Euclidean
space needs to account for all finite dimensions.

Bourbaki in his Algebra, and MacLane & Birkhoff in their Algebra,
have similar definitions.  I do not know the one you cite.  However,
the definition I have given describes an affine space as an honest
equationally presented algebraic structure; usually they just
assert that given any two points a and b, there exists a unique
vector v such that a + v = b.  With the difference of points an
explicitly given operation of the structure, the axiom
a + (b - a) = b gives the existence, and the axiom (a + v) - a = v
the uniqueness.

Using an n-dimensional real space instead of beloved R^n gets rid
of the `canonical' basis.  Observing vectors as translations of
the space of points does away with an a priory origin.  My contribution
was that to do without an a priory unit of length, let the metric
of the Euclid's space be given by a class of mutually proportinal
positive definite forms, instead of a single form.

Or shall we say that an affine space is a perfect geometric communism
where all points are equal, while in a vector space one vector is
more equal than others.

Dear Fred,

If we are talking about funny things - all right, let us talk about funny
things:

I claim that there is exactly one pair (C,T) in which:

1. C is a category, and T is a monad on C;
2. the only adjoint situations giving rise to T are determined by the
Kleisli and the Eilenberg-Moore categories.

Even though "unfortunately", in this case the Kleisli and the
Eilenberg-Moore categories coincide.

In this unique pair C is the empty category. Indeed, if C is non-empty, then
take any category A with zero object and look at the projection
AxAlg(T) ---> Alg(T) composed with the forgetful functor Alg(T) ---> C. This
composite together with its obvious left adjoint will give rise to T.

Just coincidence of the Kleisli and the Eilenberg-Moore categories is
another story of course...

NOt even the identity monad on SETS has this property, as it is
the adjunction monad also for the adjoint pair

[underlying pointset]: [topological spaces] --> SETS ,
[discrete topology on]: SETS --> [topological spaces] .

There ARE a few monads for which the Kleisli and E-M categories
"coincide," however, beyond the identity monads. First example
coming to mind is the FreeVectorSpace monad on SETS. I'm sure
other Categories-readers will point out more.

Many years ago (at least 45) Harrison mentioned to me that for any n
(including infinite cardinals), Hom(Z^n,Z) = n.Z, in other words the
Z-dual of the product is the sum.  This is obviously a very special
property of Z, almost the negation of injectivity.  Has anyone on this
list ever seen this before and can give me a reference?

You seem to have answered your main question, but here are two side points:

I have seen a definition of "Euclidean space"
better than the above (as a real inner product space):
a real affine space with a compatible metric and the parallelogram identity.
This is equivalent to a torsor of a real inner product space,
or to a real affine space modulo length-preserving transformations.

I agree that your definition is correct and this is wrong,
since Euclid had only relative lengths, not absolute length.
But it's worth knowing that the term "Euclidean space" has varied meanings.
I can try to track down the reference if you wish.


I also think that it's enlightening to look at Tarski's axioms for geometry.
These specify a set of points equipped with a ternary and a quaternary relation
(betweenness: A lies on the line segment BC; and AB is congruent to CD).
Most of the axioms are independent of dimension,
and the betweenness- and congruence-preserving bijections
are precisely the affine similarities, as you want.
(Indeed, preserving betweenness makes it affine;
preserving congruence makes it a similarity.)

But one final axiom sets the dimension;
this states (in effect) that there exist n + 1 points,
affinely independent and affinely spanning the space.
If you label the first n points (1,0,0,...) through (...,0,0,1)
and the last point the origin, then every point has a unique label,
and the space becomes \R^n.

Thus the difference between the bad "Euclidean space" as \R^n
(down to having a specific basis, with no nontrivial automorphisms)
and the good Euclid's space as you want to define it
is precisely whether the isomorphisms also fix these n + 1 points.
(Allowing the isomorphisms to permute the n non-origin points
gives us the common "Euclidean space" as a real inner product space;
allowing them to permute all of the n + 1 points
gives us "Euclidean space" as a torsor of a real inner product space,
as in the first section of this post.)

I just realised (reading my post again on the mailing list)
that Tarski's axiom doesn't give the relative distances between these points,
so these labels (and the later remarks about fixing them) are invalid.
Of course, given Tarski's n + 1 points, you can find my n + 1 points,
and even do this algorithmically (using the Gram-Schmidt process),
so my other remarks hold only if you actually do this
(so that preserving the points means preserving the results
only after the Gram-Schmidt process has been applied).
Thus, the situation is a little less elegant than I implied
(but maybe that's Tarski's fault for phrasing his axiom so liberally ^_^).

Michael,

I think Christopher Zeemann did something on this in or around  the 1950s
but cannot at the moment access mathscinet to check.

In the 1970s several of us extended Pontrjagin duality:
15.  (with P.J. HIGGINS and S.A. MORRIS), ``Countable products of
lines  and circles: their closed subgroups, quotients and duality
properties'',  {\em Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.} 78 (1975) 19-32.
in particular defining `strong duality'.

Fred, your numbering makes the example preceding your "first example"
(the identity monad) your zeroth example, but I'll number them 1 and 2
anyway.  Example 2 should work for all Archimedean fields (and
presumably all ordered fields).  Does it also work for fields not of
characteristic 0, or for the complex number field?

For more examples, all on Set, how about the following?  Example 3
extends example 1 (i.e. the identity monad is a submonad of example 3),
the rest (examples 4-9) are submonads of example 2.  This should bring
the crop of examples of Kl=EM up to 6 if I'm not mistaken (a big if),
with examples 7-9 not contributing.  All of 1-9 are finitary monads,
unlike for example the covariant power set monad whose signature is a
proper class.

3.  The lift monad 1+X on Set.  Obviously Kl=EM in this case.

But not for 1+1+X: the free bipointed sets are in a natural bijection
with the non-free ones, the latter having the two points
identified--this must be about the simplest nontrivial instance of
obtaining an algebra as a quotient of a free algebra, not a bad
introductory example when explaining how to get algebras from free algebras.

4.  The FreeAffineSpace monad on Set as the submonad of example 2
consisting of those operations whose coefficients sum to 1, i.e.
barycentric weightings where the individual weights can be any real.  I
noticed this the other day and assumed it must be well known (is it?).
It gives an alternative to France Dacar's equations yesterday showing
that the affine spaces are algebraic over Set.  The Kleisli-EM
identification certainly holds for finite-dimensional affine spaces (any
quotient is a space of lower dimension, but all spaces of a given finite
dimension are dense and therefore isomorphic); is there any reason why
the proof (with Choice) for infinite-dimensional vector spaces would not
go through for the affine case?

By way of insight into this monad, if you take those operations whose
coefficients sum to 3 say (still as a "submonad" of example 2), the
multiplication produces exactly the operations whose coefficients sum to
9, so that would-be monoid isn't closed under multiplication.  If you
think to fix this by taking the operations whose coefficients sum to 0
(remember we're allowing negative coefficients) then that attempt
doesn't have a unit.  That just leaves the barycentric operations as the
only possible submonad of example 2 consisting of operations of a fixed
total weight.

My guess would be that Kl=EM for the next two, by density (cf. examples
7 and 8).  Do statisticians know about these monads?

5.  Conservative statistics.  The submonad of example 4 where the
coefficients must be positive (and hence in (0,1]).  The next example
shows the sense in which this is "conservative."

6.  Lossy statistics.  The submonad of example 2 where both the
individual coefficients *and* their sum (over the coefficients of an
operation) are in (0,1].  Lossy statistics permits its sample spaces to
leak out through a wormhole.

The following two are examples in this vein where EM > Kl.

7.  The lattice monad (JAMS-friendly lattices, not that quaint
order-theoretic stuff that went out with the Bauhaus,
http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion81.html).  The submonad of
example 2 restricted to integer coefficients.  The free lattice on n
generators is Z^n; for n <= 2 I think all non-free quotients must be a
circle, cylinder, or torus, but for n = 3, (x,y,z) |--> (2x+z,2y+z)
produces the 2D checkerboard as an infinite quotient of Z^3 with no
cycles, pointing up the role of density in 4 above.

8.  Affine lattices.  The intersection of examples 4 and 7 (still
allowing negative coefficients).   This is the appropriate monad for
studying crystalline structure, which has no origin.  The free lattices
are the cubical crystals and all other crystalline structures are
non-free.  Unless I'm missing something the quotient (x,y,z) |-->
(2x+z,2y+z) works here too to show EM > Kl.

9.  The intersection of examples 5 and 7 (same as 6 and 7).  Isn't this
just example 1?

The chances of all my guesses being right are pretty slim, but if they
are we'd now be up to six examples of Kl=EM, namely 1 to 6 above.

What is the structure of the submonads of a monad on Set?  Anything like
algebraic lattices?

This seems right for ordered fields.  Is it also true for finite fields
and other non-ordered fields like the complex numbers?

If every Archimedean field k gives rise to a Klem (Kleisli ~ EM) monad
Vct_k, that's uncountably many Klem monads right there, all in the
lattice of submonads of Vct_R.  (The submonads of a monad must form a
complete lattice, more precisely a complete semilattice, if they're
closed under arbitrary intersection; is it always an algebraic
semilattice, as for algebras?)

k doesn't even need to be a field or an additive group, any subrig of R
will do, as Bill was hinting at.  (The coefficients have to form a rig
for T to be functorial.)  Call this Method A for forming a submonad of
Vct_R.

Method B is to limit the operations to those whose weight (sum of
coefficients) is drawn from a submonoid of the monoid R under
multiplication.  (It has to be a submonoid for the multiplication mu and
unit eta to remain defined.)  The smallest such monoid is {1}, which
gave rise to the affine spaces as per my previous post.  R has plenty of
other multiplicative submonoids, such as the set {c^i} for any real c >
0 and i ranging over any submonoid of Z under addition, or for any real
c and i ranging over any submonoid of N under addition.  This can be
combined with Method A (coefficients from a subrig of R) to get even
more submonads.

Questions:

1.  Do all submonads of Vct_R arise as above (coefficients limited to a
subrig of R, weights limited to a multiplicative submonoid of R)?

2.  Among the submonads of Vct_R, are the Klem ones exactly those for
which the set of coefficients is dense in some open interval of R?

Point taken.  I was trying to say that identifying the two constants of
a free bipointed set was the canonical way of producing any nonfree
bipointed set.  What's a slicker way to say this?

Postings crossing in the ether make this a bit confusing, but Toby Bartels
effectively answered this with his reference to Tarski's axioms so my only
additional contribution is a reference where the details for all finite
dimensions are discussed:

A lot of people long before Tarski, or Hilbert, knew how to extend this
kind of axiomatization to any finite dimension.  But is
it "satisfactory"?

Specifically, what about (n-dimensional) volumes.  Euclid 11--13 does
not well axiomatize the method of exhaustion he uses for the volume of
solids.  And Dehn's theorem that already for polyhedra the theory of
volume will not reduce to equidecomposition.

I should probably already know this, but what is known about the theory
of n-dimensional volume in axiomatic n-dimensional Euclidean geometry?

Of course Tarski's axiomatization had precursors going all the way back to
Euclid, and as is discussed in the Tarski and Givant paper none of his axioms
are new with Tarski.  There is some discussion of the actual development of
Euclidean geometry from the axioms in that article, but I believe (though I do
not actually have the book) the detailed development was presented in

Schwabhauser, W. and Szmielew, W. and Tarski, A.,
Metamathematische Methoden in der Geometrie,
Springer-Verlag, 1983

But the development is in showing how to go from the axioms to analytic
geometry not in developing a direct extension of Euclid's methods.

Dear All,

Although not strictly relevant to the discussion here, I recall once
looking at some of the theory of the `region connection calculus' and the
work of the Qualitative Spatial and Spatio-temporal Reasoning group at
Leeds. This is concerned with the interrelationships between regions of a
space.  The logical models vary from biHeyting algebras to various
multimodal logics. There was some discussion about trying to detect
dimension within such RCC systems.

If one assumes that  `region' is a more basic notion of position than
`point' a lot of Euclid still goes through but dimension seems very hard
to handle.  (I recall that Tarski worked on this area at one time.)  Can
any one tell me more as it seems of use in Geographic Information Systems=
,
and other models of qualitative or descriptive spatial information.  I
know of John Stell's work on this and he has clarified things from a
somewhat categorical viewpoint.

Perhaps the old puns about `pointless' arguments need revisiting!

Tim

(This supersedes my previous post, responding to Fred Linton, which was
written too hastily in retrospect.  The following is hopefully more
accurate.)

In my response to Fred, "method A" imposed the condition on the
coefficients of the linear combinations constituting the operations of
Vct_R that they come from a subrig C of R, in line with Bill Lawvere's
mention of rigs.  Earlier I had pointed out that affine spaces arose
from a submonad of vector spaces obtained by requiring the weight of
every operation (sum of its coefficients) to be 1, i.e. the condition W
= {1} where W is the set of permitted weights.  The latter construction
evidently generalizes to all submonads produced by method A.

I then wrote,

 > Method B is to limit the operations to those whose weight (sum of
 > coefficients) is drawn from a submonoid of the monoid R under
 > multiplication.

Sorry, that attempt at generalizing method A doesn't produce submonads
after all (the \mu of Vct_R produces operations with weights outside W,
as I'll make clearer shortly).

Worse, I can't see what the right fix should be.  In fact I can't think
of any other submonads T of "Vct_C", namely those for which T(1) is the
underlying set of a subrig C of R, such that C contains a coefficient
greater than 1, other than those submonads with W = R or W = {1}.
Conjecture: there are none.

Monads probably aren't the most convenient framework for talking about
submonads of Vct_R, certainly for the typical reader of the American
Math Monthly, who would surely understand them better in terms of
ordinary finite matrices and their multiplication since the submonads
all have the same equational theory forming the basis for matrix
multiplication, just restricted to fewer operations.

To make the connection between matrix algebra and the Kleisli category
KT for any submonad T of Vct_R, the object n of KT for n a finite set is
(from the standpoint of the morphisms of KT) a free algebra A_n on a set
that can be viewed schizophrenically as a set of n variables and a basis
for A_n.   (Semantics qua EM doesn't specify a basis but syntax qua
Kleisli does.)  KT(1,m) = T(m) is schizophrenically the m-ary operations
and the points of A_m understood as column vectors.  KT(n,1) = T(1)^n is
the set of permitted row vectors aka dual points.  More generally
KT(n,m) is the set of permitted mxn matrices over T(1) representing the
morphisms from n to m in the Kleisli category of this particular
submonad T of Vct_R.

It follows that submonads can only constrain rows by constraining T(1),
which amounts to constraining the coefficients; what I've been calling
the set C of permitted coefficients is T(1).  Submonads can constrain
columns in more general ways, but not too general.

Restating my conjecture above in this mixed monad-matrix language, given
any submonad T of the monad for Vct_R for which T(1) contains a
coefficient c > 1, the only proper submonad of T that leaves the
permitted matrix entries (the set T(1)) unchanged is that for which
every column of the permitted matrices sums to 1.

This is almost how affine geometry is standardly implemented in
computational geometry and computer graphics (CG), the difference being
that the last row of each matrix is constrained to be a unit vector with
its 1 in the "translation" column (projective geometry projected from
infinity - the translation column specifies the vector translating the
transformed point).

The following is the generic affine transformation of a generic point
(x,y) in the plane in the CG approach.

( a b s )  ( x )  =  ( ax + by + s)
( c d t )  ( y )  =  ( cx + dy + t)
( 0 0 1 )  ( 1 )  =  (      1     )

The 2x2 matrix at the top left performs an ordinary linear
transformation of the plane.  The "translation column" is at the right,
and acts by translating the plane right s and up t.

This constraint on the last row, with no constraints on the columns,
seems in total violation of the above.  However the violation is not an
essential one as the matrix

     ( a b s )
A = ( c d t )
     ( 0 0 1 )

is similar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similar_matrix) to

  -1       (    a+s         b+s         s    )
P  A P  = (        c+t         d+t       t  )
           ( 1-(a+s+c+t) 1-(b+s+d+t) 1-(s+t) )

where

     ( 1 0 0 )
P = ( 0 1 0 )
     ( 1 1 1 )

(Similarity is the matrix algebra counterpart of functoriality in
category theory.  That is, the evident nxn counterparts of P for all n
exhibit an equivalence, in fact an isomorphism, between the CG
representation of the category for affine spaces and its CT counterpart
as presented by its Kleisli category.)

It is easily seen that after applying this functor the column sums are
now 1, while a counting argument for degrees of freedom (6) shows that
the rows are no longer at all constrained.  The determinant remains
ad-bc while the trace remains a+d+1, and eigenvalues also remain unchanged.

(I only noticed this isomorphism of the two categories today.  In
retrospect it is a routine application of similarity, but is CG aware of
this particular functor?)

Other conditions on the morphisms, such as that they be orthogonal
matrices, will not in general produce submonads because they tamper with
the rows in what is likely to be an essential way that destroys
algebraicity.

The matrix viewpoint makes it a lot easier to see where my method B
breaks down: the only constraints on column sums that seem to work when
C (aka T(1)) = R are W = R and W = {1} (the conjecture above).

So what restrictions *can* we impose on the columns that preserve
algebraicity, specifically that preserve the equational theory of Vct_R?

The sets I = [0,1] and I- = (0,1] look like they could work
independently for each of C and W.  However for n > 1 we need 0 for the
unit vectors (\eta in the monad), ruling out C = I- and leaving C = I as
the only possibility here.   This still leaves the two possibilities W =
I and W = I-, the latter corresponding to disallowing zero column vectors.

The free algebras A_n on n generators for these two submonads can be
visualized geometrically as follows.

C = W = I: Unit simplexes with n+1 vertices, namely the origin and the n
unit vectors.  These are closed, containing their (n+1 choose d+1)
d-dimensional subfaces.  So n generators create ordinary n-dimensional
linear algebra confined to a simplex.

C = I, W = I- : Ditto less one point, namely the origin.

In the latter case, if the one zeroary operation (constant) 0 in T(0) is
understood as having weight 0, W = I- rules it out whence that constant
disappears.  So the 0-dimensional space A_0 is empty while A_1 is (0,1],
A_2 is a triangle less the origin, etc.

To summarize, we have as submonads of Vct_R the following:

1.  Vct_S obtained by subsetting T(1) to a subrig S of R, and
independently requiring either W = S (no constraint on W) or W = {1}
(the strongest possible constraint on W).  S could be the natural
numbers for example, with or without 0, but not the integers mod n
because that would not be a subrig of R (it would introduce new
equations we're trying to avoid).

2.  The pair of monads C = W = I and C = I, W = I-, intersected with S
as per 1 and so giving rise to lots of variants of the pair.

Does Vct_R have any other submonads?  Keep in mind the conditions that 1
belong to C and W (consider \eta) and that the rows be T(1)^n.

	The topological form of Helly's theorem might be a place to start.
However, defining dimension in terms of _convex_ structure is very
tricky once you get into general spaces. For instance, I showed in my
thesis (in a section eventualLy rewritten for _Cahiers_) that if you
define a "convex set" on S^1 to be an arc shorter than an open
semicircle, you get the obvious homology. However, if closed semicircles
and their intersections are convex, the homology becomes that of the
2-sphere.

Zeeman proved the assertion in 1955 for non-measurable cardinals n.  Ther=
e
are more general results which comprise the theory of slender (abelian)
groups; see, e.g., Chapter XIII, Sections 94-95 of [L. Fuchs, Infinite
Abelian Groups vol. 2, Academic Press, 1973], especially Corollary 94.6 o=
n
p 162.

I haven't thought much about abelian groups since the early 1960's, but i=
t
is well known that infinite direct products have very interesting
properties, both as abstract and as topological groups.  For example, a
closed subgroup of a direct product of countably many copies of  Z  is
also a direct product, but not so for uncountable products (see [R.J.
Nunke, On direct products of infinite cyclic groups, Proc. Amer. Math.
Soc. 13 (1962), pp 66-71]).  In fact, Zeeman's result implies that a
countable free group is a closed subgroup of a direct product with
uncountably many factors.  A generalization of Nunke's theorem and some
related results are contained in my old paper [Function topologies on
abelian groups, Ill. J. Math. 7 (1963), pp 593-608].

Many years ago (at least 45) Harrison mentioned to me that for any n
(including infinite cardinals), Hom(Z^n,Z) =3D n.Z, in other words the
Z-dual of the product is the sum.  This is obviously a very special
property of Z, almost the negation of injectivity.  Has anyone on this
list ever seen this before and can give me a reference?

I call to your attention our new book: "Memory Evolutive Systems: =20
Hierarchy, Emergence, Cognition", by Andr=E9e Ehresmann and Jean-Paul =20
Vanbremeersch, published in Elsevier's Series on Multidisciplinarity =20
(Volume 4, 2007).
This book, based on a 20 years long series of papers, develops the =20
theory of Memory Evolutive Systems which we have introduced as a =20
mathemati-cal model, based on category theory, for complex natural =20
systems, such as biological, social or cognitive systems. It shows how =20
well-known categorical operations (in particular (co)limits, partial =20
completions of categories and fibrations) give an approach to the =20
problems of hierarchy, emergence/reductionism, self-organization and =20
learning.
The main tools are exposed in Part A (Hierarchy and emergence), the =20
global theory in Part B (Memory Evolutive Systems), and Part C =20
(Applications to cognition and consciousness) is devoted to the case =20
of cognitive systems, studying the formation of a procedural and a =20
semantic memory allowing for the emergence of higher cognitive =20
processes up to consciousness.
The book is written for a multidisciplinary audience, with many =20
illustrative examples in the most varied domains, but also with short =20
proofs of the main mathematical results. An animation can be found on =20
the internet site:

Hi everyone,

Is there a name for a weak functor between bicategories which takes
identity 1-morphisms to identity 1-morphisms?  "Unital weak functor" would
seem an apt name, but if there is another with more precedent I'll just
use that instead.

They are usually called 'normal', at least by the Sydney school.

I don't think there's a standard term.

But, I like the term "normalized", since in certain circumstances weak
functors between
bicategories are described by cocycles in group cohomology, and the
cocycle is then
said to be "normalized" when the weak functor preserves identity
1-morphisms. It's an old
fact that every cocycle is equivalent to a normalized one, and this is
related to the fact
that every weak functor is isomorphic to a normalized one.

I suggested "normalized", but "normal" is clearly better:
you normalize something to make it normal.

On a wholly different note - I hope people take a look at the
new videos by the Catsters.  They're using YouTube in an
interesting new way: to explain monads, adjunctions and the like.

The term 'normalised' (already mentioned in the replies) goes back at
least to Grothendieck, SGA1, Exp VI: he calls a cleavage for a fibred
category E -> B normalised if the cartesian lift of each identity arrow
is an identity arrow -- this is exactly the condition for the
correponding pseudo-functor B^op -> Cat to preserve identity arrows
strictly.

11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THEORY AND APPLICATIONS OF
   SATISFIABILITY TESTING (SAT 2008)
   Call for Papers
   May 12 - 15, 2008
   Guangzhou, P. R. China
   http://www.upb.de/cs/SAT08
* The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
  Satisfiability Testing is the primary annual meeting for
  researchers studying the propositional satisfiability problem
  (SAT). SA5DT08 is the eleventh SAT conference. SAT08 features the
   SAT Race, the Max-SAT Evaluation, and the QBFEVAL.
* SCOPE
  Many hard combinatorial problems can be encoded into SAT.
  Therefore improvements on heuristics on the practical side, as well
  as theoretical insights into SAT apply to a large range of real-world
  problems. More specifically, many important practical verification
  problems can be rephrased as SAT problems. This applies to
  verification problems in hardware and software. Thus SAT is becoming
  one of the most important core technologies to verify secure and
  dependable systems. The topics of the conference span practical and
  theoretical research on SAT and its applications and include but are
  not limited to proof systems, proof complexity, search algorithms,
  heuristics, analysis of algorithms, hard instances, randomized
  formulae, problem encodings, industrial applications, solvers,
  simplifiers, tools, case studies and empirical results. SAT is
  interpreted in a rather broad sense: besides propositional
  satisfiability, it includes the domain of quantified boolean
  formulae (QBF), constraints programming techniques (CSP) for
  word-level problems and their propositional encoding and
  particularly satisfiability modulo theories (SMT).
* SUBMISSION
  Submissions should contain original material and can either be
  regular research papers up to 14 pages or short papers up to 6
  pages. Double submissions including submissions as short and long
  papers will be rejected.  Submissions should use the Springer
  LNCS style. All appendices, tables, figures and the bibliography
  must fit into the page limit. Submissions deviating from these
  requirements may be rejected without review.
  All accepted papers including short papers will be published
  in the proceedings of the conference. The conference proceedings
  will be published within Springer LNCS series. The submission page is
  http://www.easychair.org/SAT2008. Papers have to be submitted
  electronically as PDF files.
* IMPORTANT DATES
  January 11, 2008  Abstract Submission
  January 18, 2008  Paper Submission
  February 18, 2008 Author Notification
  February 25, 2008 Final Version
* PROGRAM CHAIRS
  Hans Kleine B=C3=BCning, University of Paderborn, Germany
  Xishun Zhao, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, P.R. China
* Further information on SAT Race, Max-SAT Evaluation, and QBFEVAL
  will be published also on the SAT08 conference web page.

Subject: categories: The division lattice as a category:  is 0 prime?

Has the division lattice been organized as a category somewhere in the
literature in a way that accounts somehow for 0?

A simplistic construction is [FinSet^N] denoting the finitary
finite-set-valued functors from the discrete category N.  ("Finitary" in
the sense of being zero almost everywhere.)

Interpreting N as indexing the primes and coproduct as numeric
multiplication, product becomes gcd and the pushout of (a,b) over its
gcd is its lcm.

It is simplistic by virtue of omitting (numeric) 0, which is standardly
placed at the top of the division lattice.  Unlike the rest of the
lattice 0 is not generated from the primes by finite coproducts,
suggesting it needs to feature in some sort of basis for the complete
lattice.

The natural thing would be to remove all but the primes and 0 from the
division lattice and then try to put them back finitarily.  This makes
the starting point the inverted flat CPO N^* where N consists of the
primes and "bottom" * is now at the top, denoting 0.  (That convention
makes N_* the usual flat CPO of natural numbers.)

If I'm not mistaken the completion of N^* under finite coproducts has as
objects two copies of the natural numbers.  Below * is [FinSet^N]
understood as previously.  Above * is FinSet, which was created from *
by completion under coproducts.  This amounts to FinSet + [FinSet^N]
joined at the hip with a shared initial object (numeric 1) and a shared
final object (numeric 0, or *).

 From the Yoneda standpoint the objects are functors from N_* (the usual
CPO) to FinSet.  The ones below are the functors that are 0 at * and
cofinitely many elements of N.  The ones above are 0 at N, with *
unconstrained.

Yoneda's hands are a bit tied here because we are only taking
coproducts.  Closing under finite colimits presumably frees up Yoneda to
produce FinSet x [FinSet^N]  = [FinSet^{N_*}].  This might come in handy
when one wants a system of pairs of numbers (m,n) for which
(m,n)+(m',n') = (m+m',nxn').

Is there some abstract nonsense reason why coproducts produced the sum
(actually pushout over the initial and final objects) while colimits
produced the product?

I arrived at all this after Steve Vickers mentioned on the univalg
mailing list that ring theorists define 0 to be a prime number because
then they could define n to be prime just when the ring Z/nZ extends to
a field.  This got me to wondering how this could be reflected in the
division lattice, which has 0 at the top without however being
considered a prime.  I personally am too old to believe that 0 is a
prime, but I can see where a younger generation could be hoodwinked.
Even with the above understanding however I don't see how 0 can be
understood as just another ordinary prime, any more than bottom is just
another ordinary number in N_*.

As you will have gathered from my previous posting to "categories",
over the past three years I have been applying Abstract Stone Duality
to the foundations of (constructive) analysis.   This means that
I have been bringing not only ASD itself but categorical ideas more
generally to a new audience.   However, my new friends are not very
familiar with some of the ideas that I normally take for granted.

Two things in particular have turned out to be difficult.  One of
these, not surprisingly, is my use of LAMBDA CALCULUS to define
open subspaces.   I have found notational ways to sugar this pill,
such as defining functions WITH arguments (as in most programming
languages), so avoiding lambda-abstraction unless absolutely necessary,
and simply writing "..." instead of the usual name "Gamma" for a
context or list of parameters.  I see this as part of the programme
of relating formal logical notation to the idioms of vernacular
of mainstream mathematics, as in Charles Wells' "Handbook of
Mathematical Discourse", and sections 1.6 and 6.5 of my own book,
"Practical Foundations of Mathematics", where I explain the phrase
"there exists" and the usual manipulation of finite sets.

However, there is another problem that is not simply a matter of
unfamiliar notation.   I had understood that the theory of CONTINUOUS
LATTICES had grown out of half a dozen different disciplines
(represented by the authors of the "Compendium"), and in particular
that on of these had been the concept of SEMI-CONTINUITY in real
analysis.   I had expected to find at least a basic awareness of
continuous lattices amongst analysts, but I was mistaken.  However,
it would not be appropriate to include an introduction to them in
ASD, since it does not build directly on the standard theory of
continuous lattices.  Instead, it abstracts ideas from them (in
particular the paper "Computably based locally compact spaces"
has an abstract "way below" relation), and one of its basic principles
is to hide Scott continuity in the foundations.

I would like to be able to cite an introduction to continuous lattices
that is written for (and ideally by) real analysts.  So far, my
enquiries amongst the experts on continuous lattices have drawn a
blank, but maybe some analyst has had occasion to use them, or
maybe teach a graduate course about them.

To generalise the question, is there a good account of non-Hausdorff
topology apart from those written for domain theory in theoretical
computer science?

My specific context is to rewrite Section 7 of "A lambda calculus
for real analysis", which was presented at "Computability and
Complexity in Analysis" in Kyoto in August 2005.

Mike Barr's response to my

> understood as just another ordinary prime, any more than bottom is just
> another ordinary number in N_*.

was "I don't see your problem."  And now that I reflect on that comment,
I don't see it myself.

With the benefit of sleeping on the problem combined with Mike's prod,
the moral for me is clear.  The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is
incomplete as stated.  It should read as follows.

   Every natural number partitions uniquely as a sum of 1's, and every
   positive integer factors uniquely as a product of primes.

The constructive proof of the theorem exhibits this ostensibly two-part
structure uniformly as the completion under coproducts of the inverted
flat CPO N^*.  This coproduct-complete category is naturally analyzed
into two components, additive upstairs and multiplicative downstairs.
The components share the initial and final objects of the category, with
the former manifesting as 0 in the additive component and 1 in the
multiplicative, and conversely for the latter.

And that's why 0 is at the top of the division lattice.  The reason it
(qua 1) is at the bottom of the additive component and not the top (its
default location in an arbitrary category with 1) is because it
generates Set (or in this case FinSet).

It makes no sense to consider 0 as a prime because there is no way to
define things such that 0 factors uniquely.  The role of the morphisms
in N^* is to prevent 0 from being an atom in the completion, instead
making it final in the inverted CPO, which coproducts preserve and
colimits do not.

Had we completed under colimits, by Yoneda the final object would have
been the constantly 1 functor.  The top * of N^* would then no longer be
the final object of the completion, being the unit functor for *, namely
1 at * and 0 elsewhere.  With either completion the primes are the other
unit functors, but only with the coproduct completion is the final
object a unit functor.

Define "real analyst."  These range from the practical cowboys to the
sensitive constructivists (though as Hollywood reminds us the
intersection need not be empty).  This distinction persists in
computational analysis, with Blum-Shub-Smale representing the cowboys
and Metropolis, Rota, Edalat, Escardo, Freyd, Leinster, etc. bringing up
to date the descriptive set theory program started by Borel, Baire, and
Lebesgue.

The Compendium came out in 1980.  Maybe to those of you on the right
hand side of the Atlantic it might have seemed to be addressing computer
scientists, but to most of us in the Western hemisphere (pace Wand,
Tennent, and a couple of others) it looked like it was written for
analysts.   I doubt if you're going to find a treatment written *more*
for analysts than the Compendium and its updates and successors.

For your purposes its three downsides might be its length, its datedness
(not so dated remarkably when you consider how new the subject was then
and how much has been learnt since), and its relative inaccessibility
(~$100 for second-hand copies in good condition, $50 for a solitary
"acceptable" copy, ~$160 for the new books).

The Wikipedia article on Lattices (order) has a brief introduction to
continuous and algebraic lattices that might hold the fort---if two more
sentences would do the trick add them yourself, no one will stop you.
Then there's the longer article on Domain Theory.

It's hard to imagine any analyst who's likely to be interested in
abstract domain theory not being willing to tackle the domain theory
article on its own merits, recognizing the intrinsically computational
aspects of constructive analysis, at least as the computing
professionals see it.

The modern constructive analyst is going to have to merge the paradigms
of analysis and computation in order to keep up with where computer
scientists have been pushing the subject.  Don't pander to the retards.

Right, I should have been clearer about the motivation.  I wanted to
construct the division lattice abstractly from the primes in some
finitary way, analogously to how one can construct the power set 2^X as
the free upper semilattice generated by the singletons of X.  Putting
that in terms of ideals, I'd like to be able to form all the ideals of Z
from just the prime ideals.  I don't know much about ring theory so I
could be confused about this, but I would have thought intersecting them
could only get you the square-free ideals.  Starting from the prime
power ideals takes care of that but what's the trick for getting all the
ideals from just the prime ideals?  The category Div was my suggestion
for that, but if there's a more standard approach in ring theory I'd be
happy to use that instead (or at least be aware of it---Div is starting
to grow on me).

Now that I think of it, I suppose the standard completion must be the
formation of finite subdirect products (aka sums?) of the quotients Z_p
= Z/pZ over the prime ideals pZ.  By including Z along with the Z's,
that way you reconstruct Div with the lower part consisting of Z_n =
Z/nZ and the upper part n.Z (if I understand the notation).  That puts
the ring structure of Z back into play however, which doesn't feel quite
as "pure" as simply closing a flat inverted CPO under finite coproducts.

>  Perhaps the answer to your original

Right, that (by Yoneda) was the completion under finite colimits
approach at the end of my 10:40 am message this morning, which didn't
"work" in the sense of not being the minimal solution and not having an
obviously pleasing structure either.  Completion under finite coproducts
was as small as I could make it, and initially I was miffed that there
was still this junk above the division lattice that I was hoping would
go away.  But then I decided that rather than complicate the completion
process to prevent 0 from sprouting sow's ears above it, I'd try to make
a silk purse out of the ears.  This ended up being the two-part
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic via the single construction.

With coproducts instead of colimits it's still sheaves but with the
condition that if the stalk at * is nonempty then all the other stalks
must be empty.  I don't know what the abstract-nonsense name for that is.

Um, well, for arbitrary ideals I in a commutative ring R, R/I "extends to=

a field" (or, in more common parlance, "is an integral domain") if and on=

And I thought that every generation since Dedekind, Krull and Noether
knew that divisibility lattices are (in the general case) a red herring=20
and that it is the lattice of ideals of a ring (or its opposite, if you=20
prefer) which is really important.  Surely, it makes sense to fix=20

Although 0 can be a prime (depending on the ring under consideration),=20
it is plainly never "just another ordinary prime": there is a well-known
topology on the set of prime ideals of a commutative ring which clearly
distinguishes 0 from its fellows.  Perhaps the answer to your original=20
question is to take (finite-valued) sheaves on this space of primes,=20
although I don't really understand your motivation. =20

The 10th Asian Logic Conference will be held at Kobe University, Kobe, Japan
during September 1-6, 2008.

Several short course lectures (four hours each), plenary invited talks (one
hour each) and special sessions are planned apart from contributed talks.

The Asian Logic Conference has occurred every three years in Asia-Pacific
region since 1981, Singapore. The purpose of the conference is to facilitate
interaction between researchers interested in mathematical logic, logic in
computer science, and philosophical logic. It aims at promoting activities in
mathematical logic in the Asia-Pacific so that logicians both from within Asia
and elsewhere would get together and exchange information and ideas.

Call for papers will begin in the coming winter, and the registration in an
early spring, 2008.

Please write down in your notebook as 'ALC, Kobe, Sep. 1-6, 2008'.

Thank you,

Speaking as a *nonconstructive* analyst and ``retard'', who *might*
like to know more, I'm not sure how to take this... Most analysts I
know come to accept ``better technology'' or ``a more correct
perspective'' through use, not abuse. The advantage of topological
over metric arguments in *some* contexts is what sells us on topology,
not because the definition of a maximal filter gives us a warm glow...

Didn't Aesop have something to say about the relative merits of
shouting and cajoling?

Retardedly,

Please pardon my French.  I'd have used "laggard" if I'd thought of it
in time, "retard" does push the wrong button in English.

For the irreconcilably thin-skinned: better that those standing
shivering by the warm pool jump in than that you should have to bring

Vaughn remarks
...........I would have thought intersecting them could only get you the
square-free ideals........

Indeed, as Jeff points out, we learned from Kummer and Dedekind to replace
elements by ideals, but we categorists have been late in providing a clear
account of this transition and, in particular, of the reason why the
result is  not primarily a lattice, but a monoidal closed category with
colimits.

Below I will elaborate on the following three points:

(1) The actual "ideal number" functor itself is clear enough (though never
made explicit), but why should it exist?

(2) The standard account of "why" is very categorical, but does not
directly address the algebraic category of rings nor the geometry of
intersection theory.

(3) The universal algebraists have developed a tool that might be applied
to the "why", but for some reason the universality is not often applied to
algebra or to geometry.

In more detail:

(1) The Kummer functor I goes from rigs (or K-rigs, where K is given, e.g.
Z or Q) to 2-rigs, where 2 is the 2-element rig in which 1+1=1. (Yes, the
rig that launched ring theory is not itself a ring). The functorality, as
well as the multiplication itself, depends on the set-theoretic operation
of image. The principal ideal concept is a natural transformation from M
to MI where M is the underlying multiplication.

(2) A rig can serve (not only as functions on a scheme but) as an abstract
general whose semantically corresponding concrete general is its category
of modules, which is a monoidal closed category with colimits. This
2-functor can be composed with the functor to posets that extracts from
the big category of modules just the submodules of the unit object. Again,
the image operation must in general be applied to the result of tensoring
two submodules (because of the lack of flatness). A monoidal poset with
colimits is also a 2-rig.

(3) Intersecting closed subspaces of a space may give only a shadow of a
description of their clash (e.g. the clash of Africa & Europe produces a
bulge i.e. the Alps). Although geometric figures are in general singular,
a notion of closed subspace which refines the notion of mere subset
provides a useful partial record.
In terms of the rigs of variable quantity on the spaces there is a
corresponding refinement:
The distributive lattice of radical ideals is refined to the monoidal
poset of all ideals. The ideal product under discussion is a key
ingredient in a construction of unions of subspaces that takes into
account the clashes. As it would be desirable geometrically to see even
nonsingular figures as images of maps in the category of spaces itself, it
would dually be desirable to see R/ab as the result of a construction on
R/a and R/b within the category of K-rigs itself, without the detour (2)
through modules. At least the case where K is a ring is indeed covered in
principle by a construction called the "commutator" (a misleadingly
particular "general terminology", ....groups are apparently not a typical
algebraic category). That this construction does reduce to a certain
concatenation of limits and colimits has been shown by categorists in
terms of congruence relations.

But the application to rings and ideals still remains to be done.
