		Abstract
An existing procedure to compute left Kan extensions over the ground
category Set also computes left Kan extensions over the ground categories
Cat, 2-Cat, n-Cat for any n and indeed omega-Cat.  Therefore extension data
structured in this manner already can make use of the left Kan extension
notion of a best possible approximation.  Examples include systems of labeled
transition systems and certain higher dimensional rewriting systems.

Subject: mirror database for papers by ftp

	"mirror" DATABASE FOR PAPERS IN FTP ARCHIVES (1 March 1993)

Thank you to those people who replied to Charles Wells' and my request
for information about FTP archives of papers. He has handed his information
over to me, and everything I have is in
	/theory/FTP-sites at theory.doc.ic.ac.uk

Here again is my own entry in the database by way of a template.
The meaning of the fields will be explained further down this message.

package=TaylorP
        comment=Papers by Paul Taylor at Imperial
        site=theory.doc.ic.ac.uk
        remote_dir=/theory/papers/Taylor
        local_dir+papers/TaylorP
	# email=<pt@doc.ic.ac.uk>
	# phone=+44 71 589 5111 x 5057
	# fax=+44 71 581 8024
	# address=Dept of Computing, Imperial College, London SW7 2BZ, UK

There follow some answers (not necessarily definitive) to some of the
questions people have asked me about this.

MACHINE READABLE.  I would like to stress first the importance of observing
the syntax. It is proposed that this database should be used by a program
in batch mode, so if the syntax isn't right the program will choke - at night.
Even when data is to be used by me as a human, I find it increasingly hard
to keep track of its volume unless people make an effort to set apprpriate
"Subject:" lines on their mail, keep information on one line, etc, so that
I can use "grep" to search for things in my 6Mb of email per year.

WHAT IS FTP? Having a personal FTP archive for your papers is like having a
personal journal with no referees and immediate publication. This means that
the constraints on publication, though very loose, are like those on
publishers: if you make it hard for people to subscribe (eg by allowing your
filespace to become disorganised or too large) then they'll stop. Subscribers
can get single issues by manual interactive use of FTP, or standing orders
by using the mirror program.

MY SITE DOESN'T HAVE AN ARCHIVE. Then use someone else's. There are people
from Cambridge, Darmstadt, Aarhus and other places who use the IC archive.

WHAT'S THE DATABASE FOR? Even if automatic mirroring is not used, having a
database in a machine readable format will make it much easier to find files.
Maybe you will want to keep track of your immediate colleagues' work: in
this case you can extract their entries from the database and set just those
up to be mirrored. Although the information is of no use to the mirror program,
this is also a sensible place to keep address information.

A TYPICAL FTP SESSION. Here's how you can get my Cambridge PhD thesis, for
example.

WHAT ABOUT SOFTWARE? A lot of mirroring of software already goes on; for
example the program which I propose to use was written to maintain a large
archive of general software at Imperial (not to be confused with the TeX &
Computing Theory archive which I maintain). For this reason I don't really
consider it my job to get into the business of archiving software.
Nevertheless, it does seem a good idea to add "papers/" to the local directory
entries, so that there can also be a "software/" tree and a "conferences/" tree.

CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENTS? It does seem reasonable to include those too,
so I have added "papers/" to the local directory names for papers, so that
we can have "conferences/" and "software/" too.  Use the conference name
where the author's name is appropriate for papers.

JOINT PAPERS? Where do you put joint papers in your filing cabinet? I suggest
choosing one of the authors, and then putting a cross reference (ie a short
file which says "see BloggsJ for Bloggs & Smith") in the other directories.
Personal bibliography databases should have complete entries under each
individual author.  If most of your work is done within a particular stable
group, that can have an entry in the database as if it were a single person.

ACCENTS & NAME CLASHES? It's not a good idea to use punctuation in filenames,
or to make them too long. Clashes of both surname and initials within our
community should be resolved by personal negotiation, ie agreeing to adopt
initials, if necessary fictitious ones. Choose a mixed case alphabetic version
of your surname and initials and stick to it.

WHAT IS THE "mirror" PROGRAM? It was written by Lee McLoughlin in perl and
uses the FTP protocol in much the same way as you would interactively, except
that it's automatic and should be run outside the normal working hours of the
sites concerned. You can get it from src.doc.ic.ac.uk as /packages/mirror/.
It runs under Unix and is a bit shy of non-Unix FTP archives. Nevertheless,
if some Unix site near you is maintaining an FTP archive of a wide range of
papers and software, this is still of benefit to you even though you can't
maintain your own copy on your non-Unix machine.

HOW WILL THE DATA BE MAINTAINED? In the first instance I shall maintain it
in the directory /theory/FTP-sites at theory.doc.ic.ac.uk. You may wish to
mirror this directory, but I would advise against setting up anything too
automatic for the time being. When I am satisfied that the database format
is suitable and the data is correct for the mirror program, I shall ask the
sites concerned to maintain their own databases, and use mirror to keep them
up to date in my archive.  In the long run, however, I think it would be
better for each author to maintain this information in his/her own bibtex
bibliography file (see /theory/bibliography/TaylorP.bib for instance) and
then the mirror database can be extracted from this automatically.

WHY THIS FORMAT? Per-author entries mean that you can mirror just the people
you want rather than whole sites. As long as site managers make up their
minds about directory names and stick to them, the information should only
change radically when people move to other institutions (though phone extension
numbers may change). It's sorted by site so that sites can maintain it and
to make mirror/FTP mor efficient (it only logs in to each site once).
A version sorted by author would be possible if someone wrote the program.
Sorting by topic is completely impractical, though if people maintained their
own bibtex files it would be possible to use "grep" to search by keyword.

WHAT DO THE FIELDS MEAN?
See "mirror" itself and the "defaults" at the end of the Imperial database
for further explanation.
"package" is a handle for the mirror program: you can ask it just to get
   a particular piece of software or, in this case, author's files.
"comment" is copied to the mirror program log
"site" is the Internet address of the FTP archive
"remote_dir" is the directory on that archive
"local_dir" is the directory into which you want to copy. I made a mistake
   in my original message: there should be a "+" instead of an "=". This
   means that this field is appended to the "local_dir" setting in the
   defaults so that you can set the root of your own archive (copy) tree
   as you think appropriate. Also, in order to allow conferences and software
   in the same databse, I've added "papers/" to these settings.
The remaining fields are not recognised by "mirror" and so are commented out.
"# email" is your email address in Internet format. Please put the actual
   address in angle brackets <> then you can add your name or whatever in front.
"# phone" is your direct office phone number including extension and, where
   appropriate, secretary's name and extension. Please use international
   and not America format, for example London, New York and Paris are
   +4471,  +1212  and +331  respectively, not 071, (212) or (1).
"# fax" likewise. PLease specify if this is in a public area.
"# address" postal address including country & code.

Might I recommend symbolic links instead of cross references?  

As long as the mirror software supports them, it would make the
storing of joint papers transparent.

	Can anyone recommend good introductions to enriched category theory?
	I have Kelly's "Basic concepts of enriched category theory", but would
	like to know about work after 1981 too.

The article referenced below [CCMP], also available by anonymous ftp as
boole.stanford.edu:/pub/man.tex, applies a monoidal category D to a
notion of time having two dimensions, logical strength (having to
finish in 1 minute is a stronger requirement than 2) and temporal
extent (taking 1 minute and then 2 sums to 3).  The category structure
expresses strength while the monoidal structure captures temporal
accumulation.  A behavior, whether physical or computational, is
defined to be a generalized metric space of events whose distances,
construed as delays, are objects of D, with the space satisfying a
triangle inequality.

Following Lawvere, a "generalized metric space" over D is interpreted
to mean a category enriched in D.  The abstractness of this framework
is instantiated to express a variety of concepts associated with time:
precedence, simultaneity, strict delay, causality, upper and lower
bounds on integer or real waiting time, rigid vs. flexible scheduling,
etc.  An algebra of behaviors is defined and its interpretation in
these various notions of time considered.

A brief history of enriched categories and its counterpart in computer
science, the regular algebra of semirings, is included.  Both started
in the 1960's and developed independently for two decades prior to
converging in the current work unifying the two perspectives.

The article includes a more or less self-contained treatment of
enriched categories from the perspective of this application, up to the
theorem that if D is complete and closed then D-Cat is closed.  Whereas
Kelly's treatment of these concepts is more formal and complete, it was
our intent that our treatment make the subject more accessible to
engineering-oriented readers who would prefer to view such abstractions
in the setting of a concrete application such as temporal structures.

We are currently investigating the incorporation of Winskel's
time-information duality into this model, in which every such behavior
or schedule as a metric space of *events* dualizes via Stone or
Pontrjagin duality to an automaton formalized as a complete metric
space of *states* whose distances denote correlations between those
states, with the correlations being of the standard statistical kind in
the case that the monoid of distances forms a locally compact abelian
group.  Inner product spaces provide a convenient way of achieving such
duality.  We are also investigating extensions to non-abelian groups
and monoids.  In the natural process-algebra-cum-logic of such dynamic
structures, static conjunction does not distribute over static
disjunction, but dynamic conjunction does [Pr92g].

Vaughan Pratt mentioned Lawvere's "generalized metric spaces". I would 
recommend Lawvere's paper "Metric spaces, generalized logic, and closed 
categories" (pp. 135-166 in Rendiconti del Seminario Matematico e Fisico di 
Milano XLIII (1973)). It is extremely fertile, and I think it would yield 
essential parts of its meaning even to people without much experience of 
enriched categories.

                 Venue: CWI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.


The fifth of the biennial conferences on category theory and computer science
is to be held in Amsterdam in 1993. 

The purpose of the conference series is the advancement of the foundations of
computing using the tools of category theory, algebra, geometry and logic.
Whilst the emphasis is upon applications of category theory, it is recognised
that the area is highly interdisciplinary and the organising committee welcomes
submissions in related areas. Topics central to the conference include:
        *   The semantics of computation
        *   Program logics and specification
        *   Type theory and its semantics
        *   Domain theory
        *   Linear logic and its semantics
        *   Categorical programming
Submissions purely on category theory are also acceptable as long as the
applicability to computing is evident.

Previous meetings have been held in Guildford (Surrey), Edinburgh, Manchester
and Paris. The format of this fifth meeting is to differ from previous 
meetings. Abstracts of talks are to be submitted to the organiser (details 
below). These will undergo a preliminary selection procedure and authors will
be notified of the result.  Proceedings of the conference will appear in  a
special issue of the journal Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.  All
contributors to the conference will be invited to submit full papers to the
special issue. Submissions will undergo the usual refereeing process for MSCS,
which accepts only very high standard contributions.

Organising and program committee:  
      S. Abramsky,  P.-L. Curien, P. Dybjer, G. Longo, G. Mints, 
      J. Mitchell, E. Moggi, D. Pitt, A.Pitts, A. Poigne, D. Rydeheard,

      The cover page of the submission should include the title, authors, 
      a brief synopsis, and the corresponding author's name, address, 
      phone number, fax number, and e-mail address if available.  
      Abstracts should consist of no more than 3 (three) A4 sides (not 
      including references). They must be in English, clearly written, and 
      provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess 
      the merits of the paper.  Each submission should make clear the 
      advances made by the authors, the relevance to the subject, the 
      background involved and the relationship to other work in the
      area. If the authors believe that more details are essential to
      substantiate the main claims of the paper, they may include a 
      clearly marked appendix to be read at the discretion of the 
      committee.  Late abstracts, or those departing significantly from 
      these guidelines, run a high risk of rejection.

        CATEGORY THEORY OCTOBERFEST: FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT
                  McGill University, Montreal
              Saturday-Sunday, October 9-10, 1993


Dear Colleague,

Once again this October the Category Theory Research Center will sponsor
a weekend meeting at McGill University.  This annual event brings
together mathematicians interested in the categorical aspects of logic,
computer science, combinatorics, universal algebra, homological algebra,
topology, analysis, and theoretical physics.

If you wish to speak, please contact Michael Barr.  We particularly
wish to encourage advanced students and new PhDs to use this forum
to disseminate their work.

A list of hotels and tourist rooms will be distributed in the Fall,
along with a preliminary list of speakers.  The final schedule of
talks be drawn up the morning of Oct 9.  If you have any further
questions, please contact Tom Fox.
