I have seen several references to an unpublished 1973 manuscript by Jean
Benabou on profunctors.

I have had no success finding an e-mail address for Prof. Benabou. Does he
have one?

Peter Johnstone has a very nice synopsis of the subject in his new book in
section B 2.7.  Francis Borceux has a more elementary treatment of
distributors in the first volume of his handbook of categorical algebra.

Are there other sources which offer a substantial discussion of profunctors?

I would be happy to pay duplication and mailing costs to obtain a copy of the
Benabou paper.

Thanks for any information you can provide.

Carl Futia

Sorting through old papers after the move to our new house, I came
across a communication to Categories by Bill Lawvere, dated 21 Nov 2001,
entitled
"categories:K-spaces and Hurewich", and concerned with the history of
k-spaces and related concepts.
I thought the following bit of history worth contributing.

Before studying monoidal closed categories in his well-known doctoral
thesis, Brian Day wrote a very pleasant Masters thesis on monoidal
closed structures on variants of topological spaces. For some reason
this never got published - perhaps it was not thought original enough at
the time - but it
contained the perfect way of introducing k-spaces; and not just
hausdorff ones - restricting to those is an error.

One starts with the category Top of topological    spaces, and the
category Comp of compact hausdorff spaces. Based on Comp, one forms
Steenrod's category of quasi-spaces: a quasi-space is a set X along
with, for each A in Comp, a subset of Set(A,X) whose elements may be
called the "allowable" maps - one imposes a few evident axioms on these.
The quasi-spaces form a category Qu, whose morphisms from X to Y are
those set-maps whose composites with allowables are allowable.

This is of course classical; but what Brian had is the following. There
is an evident functor f: Top --> Qu; just call A --> X allowable if it
is continuous. There is an equally evident functor
g: Qu --> Top; call a subset open if its characteristic function into
the Sierpinski space 2 lies in Qu. We have the adjunction g --| f. As
with any adjunction, we have an equivalence between the full subcategory
of Top where the counit is invertible and the full subcategory of Qu
where the unit is invertible.

The subcategory of Top here, of course reflective in Top, is the
category of k-spaces, better called the "compactly-generated" spaces; it
is also a coreflective full subcategory of Qu. Others have noticed this
since and published it; but certainly subsequent to Brian's 1968 (I
think) Master's thesis.

Of course one is not obliged to use Comp in defining one's quasi-spaces;
write Qu' for the quasi-spaces based instead on Top. Now Top --> Qu' is
fully faithful, and reflective: we know the reflexion explicitly. Again
Qu' is cartesian-closed, although Top is not. This is how Brian and I
proved those results in [On topological quotient maps preserved by
pullbacks or products, Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc.67, 1970, 553 - 558].
We did the pulling back in the cartesian closed Qu', applied the
reflexion, and wrote down the condition for preservation.

We feared, however, that topologists would be frightened off by these
"abstract categorical notions"; so we went through all that we had done,
translating it into the usual language of topology, before we submitted
it for publication. The readers, with our motives and techniques so
concealed, must have thought it black magic.

Of course, as Bill Lawvere said, the whole "quasi" business should be
done abstractly, and turns out to involve subcategories of presheaf
categories, with associated toposes like that of Peter Johnstone.

I see that this letter has become very long. I must apologize: but so
much of our history is getting lost forever.

Max Kelly.

The NASSLLI Steering Committee is pleased to announce the Second North
American Summer School in Logic, Language and Information, to be held
in Bloomington, Indiana, June 17-21, 2003.  The event follows on from
the successful first school at Stanford in June, 2002. The school is
focussed on the interfaces among linguistics, logic, and computation,
broadly conceived, and on related fields.  Our sister school, the
European Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information, has been
highly successful, becoming an important meeting place and forum for
discussion for students and researchers interested in the
interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information.  We hope
that the North American schools will follow in this tradition.

Hello,

I would like to know if anybody is doing research on applying category
theory to hereditarily-finite sets, e.g. where an object is a
hereditarily set with some kind of structure to it and morphism that
preserves that structure. Obviously, the subcategory of SET where
objects
are just hered. finite sets and morphisms are functions between hered.
finite sets is not "interesting". Also, the case where an object is a
hered. set together with an endomorphism doesn't sound "interesting".
I would like URL's of papers if possible. Thank you.

Regards, Bill

Hi,

is category theory a suited language to express "structure" in
scheduling or combinatorial optimisation problems ?

Thanks,

Dear Colleagues:

June will be theoretical computer science month at U. Ottawa! The
Field's Institute will sponsor a summer school in Logic and
Foundations of Computation at the University of Ottawa this
summer, June 2-20, 2003.  This program will be hosted by the logic
group in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the
University of Ottawa  (consisting of Philip Scott, Richard Blute,
and Peter Selinger).

The program will consist of 2 weeks of courses for graduate
students, then a week of workshops in several areas of
theoretical computer science.   This program is particularly aimed
at graduate students in mathematics, logic, theoretical computer
science, mathematical linguistics and related areas. The program
culminates in the 18th annual IEEE Logic in Computer Science
(LICS2003) meeting on campus at U. Ottawa.  For the latter,
see  http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/als/lics/

The details (and finances) of the Field's program are still being worked
out, but we wanted to alert our colleagues to the following themes:

Weeks 1,2:  Each week will consist of two courses (one in the
morning, the other in the afternoon), taught by experts in the
area.  We are planning topics that include:

Week 1: (a) Categorical Logic and type theory and  (b) Linear Logic.
Week 2:  (a) Game Semantics   and (b) Concurrency.
Week 3:  Workshops.  These include, among other topics,

June 15-16:  Quantum Programming Languages   (Org:  Peter Selinger),
June 18-19: Mathematical Linguistics (Org:  J. Lambek)

There are currently two other workshops being planned.

Some Limited Funding Scholarships will be made available to
graduate students for attending the workshop.  More details on how
to apply will be made available soon.  Meanwhile, interested
students may contact  any members of the local logic team to
be alerted as news becomes available.

I (and a colleague) wonder whether what Max Kelly is referring to is
what Brian Day published in an incredibly concise way in pages 4-5 of
the paper "A reflection theorem for closed categories", J. Pure
Appl. Algebra 2 (1972), no. 1, 1--11.

Max Kelly writes:

(We would also be interested in having a copy of the version of the
paper "On quotients maps preserved by product and pullback" before the
translation from category theory to topology (referred to in the
deleted part of Kelly's message). Is that still available?)

For a category E with finite limits, every morphism f:A\to B induces a
pullback functor f^*:E/B\to E/A of slice categories, with a left adjoint
given by u:a\to a' \mapsto u:fa\to fa'.  It has been well known since the
late 1960's that this left adjoint is comonadic, but who proved this,
and where?

Given a geometric morphism n:E->F between Grothendieck toposes (over, say,
Set) E is both an F-indexed category and a Set-indexed category. There is
the following change of base result for any small (i.e. internal to Set)
category C: -

The category of F-indexed functors p^*C->E is equivalent to the category
of Set-indexed functors C->E (where the first E is as an F-indexed cat and
the second as a Set-indexed cat). (And p:F->Set.)

Is there anything published/known as to the naturality of this equivalence?
It is easy to see that it is natural in functors on C; but I also think (a)
that it may be natural with respect to filtred cocontinuous functors between
inductive completions of C and (b) between filtered cocontinuous functors on
E.

Thanks for any thoughts on this technical question,
Regards, Christopher Townsend (Open University).

I take it that you want to capture the WELL FOUNDED ELEMENT RELATION,
and also the SUBSET RELATION, from set theory. You may be interested in

1. Gerhard Osius, "Categorical set theory: a characterisation of the
   category of sets", Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 4 (1974) 79--119.
2. Peter Johnstone, "Topos Theory", Cambridge University Press, 1977,
   of which chapter 9 has a summary of Osius's work.
3. Andre Joyal & Ieke Moerdijk, "Algebraic Set Theory", LMS Lecture Notes
   220, Cambridge University Press, 1995.
4. Paul Taylor, "Intuitionistic Sets and Ordinals", Journal of Symbolic
   Logic, 61 (1996) 705--744.
5. Paul Taylor, "Practical Foundations of Mathematics", Cambridge
   University Press, 1999, especially Sections 6.3, 6.7 and 9.5.
      http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations

Gerhard Osius's work was significant in 1974 as one of the ways in
which it was shown that toposes do the same thing as set theory.  In
fact Osius's is, so far as I am aware, the only 1970s work that
discusses *set* theory - Benabou, Joyal, Lawvere, Mitchell etc showed
that toposes do the same thing as some form of *type* theory.  Of
course, it is the latter that mathematicians actually use when they
claim to be using set theory as foundations.  (See Section 2.2 of my
book for a type-theoretic formulation of set theory as mathematicians
actually use it.)

Joyal and Moerdijk treat a model of set theory as a free algebra
(within some larger world) for singleton and unions of specified size.
If you are specifically interested in "finiteness" rather than the
hereditary aspects in general, this might be the structure that you
want (page 88).

My JSL paper develops the notions of "transitive set" and "ordinal" in
the sense of a carrier equipped with a binary relation with particular
properties. Its style is therefore like order theory or other
"ordinary" mathematics, since it attributes no ontological significance
to the relation.  It gives a version of Mostowski's theorem,
in which the extensional quotient of a well founded relation is
constructed as the quotient by an equivalent relation, and not
(as you will find the in the set theory textbooks) using Replacement.

In both Joyal--Moerdijk and my work, it is shown that *several*
qualitatively different notions of ordinal arise intuitionistically.

What remains of considerable interest (once we have agreed that set theory
is wrong, wrong, wrong) is Osius's categorical notion of recursion.

The equation       f(x)  =   r( { f(y) | y in [=element_of] x } )

he writes as the (3=1, not 2=2) commutative square

                            P(f)
  { y | y in x }   P(X)  --------->   P(A)
       ^            ^                  |
       |            |                  |
       |            |                  |
       |            |                  | r
       |            |                  |
       |            |                  |
       -            |        f         v
       x            X  ------------->  A

which we may of course generalise to a "homomorphism" from any P-coalgebra
to any P-algebra, where indeed P may be any functor instead of the covariant
powerset functor.  The coalgebra admits recursion by definition if there is
exactly one such "homomorphism" to any algebra whatever.

Osius showed that coalgebra homomorphisms,

              P(h)
       P(A) --------> P(B)
        |              |
        |              |
        | r            | s
        |              |
        |              |
        v              v
        A -----------> B

capture the set-theoretic inclusion relation A<B.

The exercises in Chapter VI of my book explore applications of the
commutative square to recursive functional programs. In particular, a
categorical treatment is given for the idea of an "accumulator" that
functional programmers use to write tail-recursive list programs.

Osius's 3+1 square is about RECURSION - defining functions or programs -
but I have also considered INDUCTION - proving theorems - categorically.

Again this is a property of coalgebras.

                     P(m)
     P(U)  >------------------------> P(A)
      ^                                |
      |                                |
      |                                | r
      | ----|                          |
      |     |                          |
      |     |                 m        v
      H  >--------->  U  >---------->  A

Suppose that, for any mono m, if the above diagram is a pullback, then
m is in fact an isomorphism. The we say that r:PA->A is a WELL FOUNDED
COALGEBRA.

Sections 6.3 and 6.7 of the book give a sketch of the theory of well
founded coalgebras, and the final section (9.5) shows how this
categorical notion of ordinal can be used to define transfinite
iterates of a functor (for example, internally in a topos)

I have a long unfinished paper containing all of the details about
well founded coalgebras. This shows how the various intuitionistic
notions of ordinal (plus some new ones!) arise from considering the
"lower sets" functor on Pos instead of the covariant powerset on Set.

Besides the functor P and the underlying category, we can vary the
class of maps that we call "monos".  In its role in the above "broken
pullback" diagram, this controls the logical strength of the induction
scheme, ie the number of quantifiers that we allow in the definition
of the predicates for which induction is applicable.

However, for characterising the ordinals, the interesting variability
is in the class of "monos" used to define EXTENSIONALITY.

The full subcategory of extensional coalgebras (those for which
r:PA >--> A is "mono") is closed under arbitrary limits in the
category of well founded coalgebras and coalgebra homomorphisms.
However, depending on the particular situation, we need the axiom
of REPLACEMENT to construct the reflection (left adjoint to the
inclusion).  One day, I hope to use this to explore this
frighteningly strong set theoretical principle categorically.

Dear Categorists -

Who first constructed internal categories, internal functors
and internal natural transformations in a given category, and
actually proved that these form a *2-category*?  I'm looking for
a reference.

Best,
jb

Though the following is of much less broad interest, I think it is
appropriate to be noticed. There is a (full) Russian translation,
available both online (at http://www.mccme.ru/free-books/) and as a
published book.

NASSLLI-2003
Second North American Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information
http://www.indiana.edu/~nasslli/

June 17-21, 2003, Bloomington, Indiana

NASSLLI '02 Continues North American Summer School Tradition
---------

Following last year's founding of a North American counterpart to the
European Summer School for Logic, Language and Information, this year's
NASSLLI will be at Indiana University. It will again feature a Student
Session where students can network and get feedback on their work -- both
from faculty and student attendees. This CFP solicits submissions to the
student session.

Topics of Interest
-------
The areas of interest are

	Logic -- including work on problems of mathematical or
                 philosophical  interest
	Language -- including descriptive or theoretical work in formal
                 linguistics
	Language and Logic -- applications of logic to natural language
	Language and Computation -- theoretical and empirical work in
                 computational linguistics
	Logic and Computation -- automated theorem-proving and related
                 fields
	Computation -- artificial intelligence or related areas of
                 computer science

Work integrating several of these areas is of particular interest.


Requirements
-----
The Student Session papers should describe original, unpublished
work that has been completed. However, no previously published papers
should be submitted.

All authors must be at the pre-doctoral level; submissions co-authored
by non-students will be discarded.


Format of Submission
-----
Full papers, not to exceed 10 pages, are to be submitted by email as Adobe
Portable Document Files (PDF).  This file must include a separate
identification page including the following pieces of information:

  Title: title of the submission
  First author: firstname lastname
  Address: address of the first author
  ......
  Last author: firstname lastname
  Address: address of the last author
  Short summary: abstract (5 lines)
  Subject area (one or two of): Logic | Language | Computation
  Other Conferences Submitted To:

Neither this identification page, nor any bibliography counts towards the
10 page limit.

Since reviewing will be blind, the body of the paper should omit author
names and addresses. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's
identity (e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991)... ") should be
avoided. It is possible to use instead references like "Smith (1991)
previously showed..."

The PDF of the paper is to be enclosed in an email duplicating the
information on the identification page. Use US Letter paper and LaTeX if
possible; accepted papers will need to be resubmitted without page
numbers.

Please email submissions to John Hale <hale@cogsci.jhu.edu> by MARCH 15th
2003.

NASSLLI '03
-----
At least one author needs to register for NASSLLI '03 in order to be in
the student session. Accepted papers will be available at the Summer
School in the Student Session Proceedings (tentative plans exist for
on-line dissemination as well). One of the authors will give a 20-minute
talk with up to 10 minutes for discussion.

Dates
----

Deadline for submission of papers		: March 15th, 2003
Author notifications				: May 1st, 2003
Revisions in accepted papers due by		: June 1st, 2003
ESSLLI-2003 Student Session			: June 17-21, 2003.

John Baez asks who constructed internal categories, functors, and natural
transformations, proving these to form a 2-category; and seeks a reference.
The answer is surely Ehresmann; and the precise reference must be in an
early part of his collected works, produced after his death, with a detailed
commentary, by his widow Andree Ehresmann-Bastiani. I have at least the
earlier volumes of these, which - being now a visitor here in Sydney, John -
you may certainly borrow. I'll have a bit of a look myself, if I have the time;
Ehresmann's language is at times far from what has now become the norm.
(Finding his categorical insights into differential geometry unappreciated by
his French colleagues, he cut himself off and set up an independent group
based in Paris VI (where he was) and in Amiens (where Bastiani was); with
their own journal, Cahiers de Topologie et Geometrie Differentialle. The
definitive rapprochement between this group and other category theorists
dates from 1973, when the first of several international conferences at Amiens
was arranged by Ehresmann and Bastiani.)

Probably there will be no need for me to take these volumes down tonight; for
Andree will doubtless see John's question when it dawns in Paris in an hour or
two, and will doubtless give us chapter and verse.

Max Kelly.

Martin Escardo (Categories 8 Jan.) is correct in surmising that the
results of Brian Day's 1968 M.Sc. thesis are included, in a much more
general form, as an example in his 1972 article in JPAA. My point was only
the history of the matter; the 1972 paper is one of three which together
expound the content of Brian's Ph.D. thesis, and appeared four years later
than his Masters degree. In the interim the adjunction between topological
spaces and Spanier's quasi-spaces, and the relation of this to
compactly-generated spaces, had been observed and published by two or
three other of our colleagues; Booth was one, and there was at least one
more whose name escapes me. Brian was then rueful about not submitting the
M.Sc. thesis for publication in 1968; as his supervisor, I shared his rue.

Martin also seeks more information about the hidden category theory
behind my 1970 paper with Brian. There was never anything like a
"categorical version" that got turned into a "topological" one;
we translated as we went. I believe my 2 Jan. letter to Categories
contains enough hints to make a reconstruction straightforward, even if
a bit long and tedious.

Max Kelly.

In answer to John Baez

Charles Ehresmann introduced internal categories to unify several examples
of this notion that he had studied in earlier papers, namely topological
and differentiable categories and specially groupoids (i.e. internal to Top
and Diff) which he used extensively in his works on the foundations of
differential geometry in the early fifties, ordered categories of several
types (i.e. internal to sub-categories of the category of posets) also used
in these works, and double categories (of which the 2-categories are a
particular case) which he had introduced in his 1958 paper

         "Categorie des foncteurs types", Rev. Un. Mat. Argentina XX (1960).

He defines the notion of internal categories (which he called "categorie
structuree") and internal functors in the paper

         "Categories structurees", Ann. Ec. Normale Sup. 80 (1963),

and internal natural transformations in the sequel of this paper

"Categories structurees III: Quintettes et applications covariantes",
Cahiers Top. et GD V (1963)

where he constructs the double category of "quintettes structures" of which
the 2-category of internal categories is a sub-2-category.

However in these papers he defined only categories internal to a concrete
category, which explains the name "categorie structuree". Later on he
defined the general notion of an internal category, initially called
"categorie structuree generalisee", in

"Introduction to the theory of structured categories", Technical Report 10,
Un. of Kansas at Lawrence, 1966

where he introduced the theory of sketches and, in particular, the sketch
of a category. In this paper and in the paper

"Categories structurees generalisees", Cahiers de Top. et GD X-1 (1968)

he compares with the notion of a "C-category on (A,A0)" which Grothendieck
had defined in 1960-61 by the fact that the Hom(A,-) are equipped with a
natural strucutre of category.

All the papers of Charles are reprinted in "Charles Ehresmann: Oeuvres
completes et commentees", in the comments of which I give more historical
information on this subject..

                         With all my best wishes for 2003
                                         Andree C. Ehresmann

Sammy Eilenberg told me he wrote a paper based on the Day-Kelly paper

	On topological quotient maps preserved by pullbacks or products,
	Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 67 (1970) 553-558.

I believe Sammy's paper was for an MAA expository series.  It sounded
a beautiful approach but I did not see the manuscript and forget the
details.  While the paper was in the universal categorical spirit it
made only one parenthetic remark that something was a category. Sammy
claimed this was why the paper was rejected.  What a great pity!

I would love to have a copy of the preprint. Does anyone else know about it?

Hello --

Does anyone know of a generalization of Browder's Fixed Point Theorem
from R^n to arbitrary topological spaces, or to categories of same?


*****************

Theorem (Browder, 1960):  Suppose that S is a non-empty, compact, convex
subset of R^n, and let

	f: [0,1] x S --> S

be a continuous function.   Then the set of fixed points

	 { (x,s) | s = f(x,s), x \in [0,1] and s \in S }

contains a connected subset A such that the intersection of A with {0} x
S is non-empty and the intersection of A with {1} x S is non-empty.

Many thanks,

I'm intrigued by Peter McBurney's question [below]. It looks rather like a
question of the constructive content of Brouwer's fixed point theorem.

Suppose S is (homeomorphic to) an n-cell. Then in the internal logic of the
topos of sheaves over [0,1], f is just a continuous endomap of S. If
Brouwer's theorem were constructively true then f would have a fixpoint,
and that would come out as a continuous section of the projection [0,1]xS
-> [0,1]. More precisely, it would be a map g: [0,1] -> S such that f(x,
g(x)) = g(x) for all x. If this existed then the set A = {(x, g(x))| x in
[0,1]} would be as required.

However, the proof of Brouwer that I've seen is not constructive - it goes
by contradiction. So maybe the requirements on A are a way of getting
constructive content in Brouwer's result.

What is known constructively about Brouwer's fixed point theorem?

Steve Vickers.

Similar thoughts had occurred to me. Brouwer's theorem is clearly
not constructive, since it doesn't hold (even locally) continuously in
parameters (consider a path in the space of endomaps of [0,1]
passing through the identity, where the fixed point `flips' from
one end of the interval to the other as it does so). However, Browder's
result would seem to suggest that the `locale of fixed points of f'
(that is, the equalizer of f and the identity in the category of
locales) might be consistent (that is, `inhabited') in general,
even though it may not have any points. It's certainly conceivable
that that might be true constructively, though I can't see how to
prove it -- but it isn't the full content of Browder's theorem.

In Errett Bishop's Constructive Analysis (anyone who is interested in
analysis over a topos absolutely must know this book), he proves that for
any continuous endomorphism f of a disk and for every eps > 0, there is a
point x in the disk for which |f(x) - x| < eps.  A couple of points should
be made.  First f has to be constructible and eps has to be provably
positive.  For Bishop, a real number is an equivalence class of pairs of
RE sequences of integers a_n and b_n such that for all m,n |a_n/b_n -
a_m/b_m| < 1/m + 1/n and a function is constructive if it is a machine for
turning one such sequence into another.  To be continuous, it there must
be a function delta(eps) that produces for each eps > 0, a delta(eps) such
that |x - y| < delta(eps) implies that |f(x) - f(y)| < eps.  (In fact,
there is a non-constructive proof that every constructive function is
continuous.)

Bishop then claims, without proof as far as I can see, that there is a
fixed point free endomorphism of the disk.  What this means is that when
you extend this function to all reals, any fixed point is not a
constructible real number.

There seems to be some confusion about the theorem Peter McBurney asked about.

The reference he cited was by Felix E. BROWDER (1960) who proved a number of
fixed point results of considerable interest to functional analysts.

The theorem the list seems to be discussing is due to BROUWER (Math. Ann.
69(1910) and 71(1912).

No, there is no confusion. Browder's theorem appears to provide insight
into the constructive content of Brouwer's theorem. Both are being discussed.

Actually, Bishop purposely avoids taking a real to be an equivalence
class of sequences, presumably because he does not want to assume the
axiom of countable choice.

A sequence as described above is sometimes called a "fundamental
sequence". Two such sequences x = (a_n/b_n) and y = (c_n/b_n) are
said to "coincide", written x ~ y iff

                   |a_n/b_n - c_m/d_m| < 2/n + 2/m,

where I might have gotten the right-hand side slightly wrong.

Now there are two possibilities:

(1) we say that a real is an equivalence class of fundamental
sequences under the relation ~, or

(2) we say that a real _is_ a fundamental sequence, where two reals
are claimed "equal" if they coincide (the approach taken by Bishop).

The first alternative gives us what is usually called "Cauchy reals".

The difference between the two is apparent when we attempt to show
that every Cauchy sequence of reals has a limit. In the first case we
are given a sequence of equivalence classes of fundamental sequences.
In order to construct a fundamental sequence representing the limit we
need to _choose_ a representative from each equivalence class.

In the second case a Cauchy sequence of reals is a sequence of
fundamental sequences, so no choice is required.

There seems to be an open question in regard to this, advertised by
Alex Simpson and Martin Escardo: find a topos in which Cauchy reals
are not Cauchy complete (i.e., not every Cauchy sequence of reals has
a limit). For extra credit, make it so that the Cauchy completion of
Cauchy reals is strictly smaller than the Dedekind reals.

Has this been advertised on this list already? Or was it the FOM list?

[If anyone replies to this, I suggest you start a new discussion thread.]

One small clarification: Regarding the extra credit, there doesn't
seem to be a reasonable "absolute" way of defining the completion in
question. E.g.  the various, constructively different, notions of
metric completion already assume the existence of some given complete
reals. However, one can always embed the Cauchy reals into the
Dedekind reals, which are always Cauchy complete, and then look at the
smallest "subset" containing this which is closed under limits of
Cauchy sequences (where Cauchy sequences are defined as in Andrej's
message). We sometimes call this, somewhat verbosely, "the Cauchy
completion of the Cauchy reals within the Dedekind reals".  But notice
that this is the same as what one gets starting from the rationals
within the Dedekind reals and then closing under limits and hence
could be called the "Cauchy completion of the rationals within the
Dedekind reals".

NB. Freyd characterized the Dedekind reals as a final coalgebra. Alex
Simpson and I characterized "the Cauchy completion of the rationals
within the Dedekind reals" as a free algebra (to be precise, we
started from the algebras as a primitive notion and later found this
construction of the free one). But this has already been discussed in
postings in the past few years.

Does one get any known versions of reals by performing the Cauchy or
Dedekind construction starting with initial algebras I for non-decidable
lifts L
instead of the NNO? It would be then also natural to interpret Cauchy
sequences and completeness using appropriate I-indexed families, of course.

Even for "integers" Z one has at least three different options:
taking I^op+1+I, taking the colimit of I->LI->LLI->..., each map being
the unit, or taking the colimit of the corresponding I-indexed diagram.
It would be strange if these turn out to be isomorphic. Is any of them an
initial
algebra for some simple functor?

Similarly there are various possibilities for rationals - taking fractions,
i.e. a quotient
of ZxZ, or colimit of all multiplication maps Z->Z, or of the corresponding
Z-indexed
diagram.

Actually I have not followed the ongoing research for a while, so maybe my
questions
are outdated. I would be grateful for any references to related work.

and vaughan pratt and i characterized the cauchy reals as a final
coalgebra. the papers are i proceedings of CMCS 99 and in TCS 280. in
fact, freyd came up with his characterization of the closed interval
while commenting on our first paper, where vaughan and i worked with the
semiopen interval.

but it is fair to say that the algebraic approach allows easier
algebraic operations on reals. (i only managed to multiply them in one
of our coalgebras, and in a very inefficient way.)

BTW have you seen the book:

    Life Itself. A Comprehensive Inquiry Into the Nature, Origin, and
Fabrication of Life
    by Robert Rosen (Columbia University Press 1991)

it was referenced in a biology paper, i found it in the biology library,
and it's full of categories. (yes, i kno, people often do that to sound
complicated, but this seems like honest work, perhaps even inspiring,
although it does not go very deep.)

The construction of the reals as the Cauchy completion of the rationals
was worked out in full and glorious detail in the Montreal spring of
1973. The point is that taking equiconvergence classes of Cauchy
sequences fails to construct the reals in a topos because of the absence
generally of countable choice. Take your favourite example of a topos in
which this fails, and you are most of the way to having your
counter-example.

To obtain the constructive version of the Cauchy reals, coinciding with
the Dedekind reals in any topos with natural number object, you need to
think a little more carefully about you are trying to achieve. The
important thing about a Dedekind real is that there exist rationals that
are arbitrarily close to it. The problem is that of choosing an instance
of a rational at distance < 1/n from the real for each n. If you have
countable choice, then choose away, get a Cauchy sequence, and have an
isomorphism of Cauchy reals with Dedekind reals.

Without countable choice, you still have an inhabited subset of the
rationals consisting of all rationals at a distance of < 1/n from the
Dedekind cut. This gives you a sequence of such subsets - a Cauchy
approximation to the real. The constructive version of the Cauchy reals
is the set of equiconvergence classes of Cauchy approximations on the
rationals. For the details, later extended to the context of seminormed
spaces over the rationals, with the set of rationals as the canonical
example, see papers such as Burden/Mulvey in SLN 753 and my paper Banach
sheaves in JPAA 17, 69-83 (1980).

In the present context, the question is whether you wish to study the
deficiencies of toposes in which countable choice fails, in which case
Cauchy sequences are for you, or whether you want to develop
constructive analysis within a topos, in which case you need to look at
Cauchy approximations instead. Ask yourself, when you take a point in
the closure of a subset, do you get handed a Cauchy sequence converging
to it, or a sequence of possible choices of elements within 1/n of it if
only you had countable choice to choose them. If the former, go for
Cauchy sequences and count your blessings. If the latter, work with
Cauchy approximations, which are every bit as powerful as Cauchy
sequences and with respect to which the reals are Cauchy complete.

Of course, the approach to Banach spaces through completeness defined in
terms of Cauchy approximations acquires collateral justification in
terms of the approaches to Banach sheaves taken by Auspitz and
Banaschewski, to which reference can be found in the papers above. It is
also the approach that allows Gelfand duality to be established
constructively between commutative C*-algebras and compact completely
regular locales in work with Banaschewski and with Vermeulen.

Dear toposophers,

With constructivity of real arithmetic back on the front burner for the
moment, let P be the ring of bounded power series a0 + a1.x + a2.x^2 + ..=
=2E
with integer coefficients a_i, where the bound is, for each such series,
an integer c such that |a_i| < c (3/2)^i / i^(3/2).

Let 1-2x generate the ideal I of P.  Then the quotient ring P/I turns out=

to be the field of reals [AMM 105(1998), p.769].

This is more constructive than it might appear, being just an obscure
(or clear depending on your upbringing) way of representing reals in a
redundant binary notation.  The ring P permits fast arithmetic essentiall=
y
by deferring carries.  Carries are "propagated" when needed by quotientin=
g
by I, which works by collapsing every formal power series to one all of
whose coefficients other than a0 are either 0 or 1 and which has infinite=
ly
many 0s (equivalently, no infinite run of 1's).

In this view of things, a real is understoood as an integer (a0) plus a
binary fraction in [0,1) (the rest of some "binary" formal power series,
meaning one with a_i =3D 0 or 1 for i > 0 and infinitely many 0s).  A gen=
eral
formal power series without this restriction to 0 and 1 then constitutes
a redundant representation of a real, which can be made irredundant when
needed (e.g. when comparing with <) by quotienting by I.

An intuitively clear but less constructive view is to evaluate each serie=
s at
x =3D 1/2, the root of 1-2x, noting that any series bounded as above conv=
erges
absolutely there.  Series identified by I are those that evaluate to the
same real at x =3D 1/2.

What is nonconstructive about this is that direct evaluation of an infini=
te
series at a point requires infinite time, no matter how large and paralle=
l
the infinite circuit computing it may be.

In contrast, P and P/I are more constructive in the following sense.
Addition and subtraction in P require circuit depth O(1) using an infinit=
e
circuit whose gates perform integer addition and subtraction (just do it
coordinatewise).  Reduction mod I takes longer, but there is a variant of=

the above in which it is fast enough.  Instead of the field R we settle
for just the group R, and instead of |a_i| < c (3/2)^i / i^(3/2) we settl=
e
for simply |a_i| < c.  In this case any given series can be reduced (same=

generator 1-2x) to the above normal form in circuit depth log_2(c) (nice
exercise), a finite quantity despite the series itself being of infinite
length and fluctuating arbitrarily within =B1c.

Multiplication is problematic for two reasons.  First it obliges the weak=
er
bound, complicating reduction.  Secondly it is a convolution, complicatin=
g
arithmetic even when carry propagation is deferred.  I don't see obvious
solutions to either of these problems.  On the other hand I have no a pri=
ori
reason to suppose that these circuit-theoretic complications of passing
from R as a group to R as a ring or field would be reflected in suitably
constructive topos-theoretic developments of these notions.

An earlier book of Rosen's applying category theory to biology (or
rather, speaking more carefully, exploring how one might conceive of
applying category theory to biological domains) was:

"Anticipatory Systems:  Philosophical, Mathematical and Methodological
Foundations"  (Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK 1985)

Hello,

     I am trying to get my mind around (pre-)sheaves. I have studied point
set topology in the past, but I didn't run into the notion of local
homeomorphism. It seems to me that every local homeomorphism is a
homeomorphism (because in a topological space (X, T), X is always a
neighorhood of any point in X). Am I correct?

Regards, Bill Halchin

With all this talk about real numbers, perhaps readers would be
interested in my little paper (reporting an idea of Steve Schanuel):

	An efficient construction of the real numbers,
	Gazette Australian Math. Soc. 12 (1985) 57-58.

which may be hard to find. However, a recent report of an
undergraduate vacation project can be obtained at

	http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~street/efficient.pdf

This project convinced me that this construction is a good one for
teaching undergraduates.

Others have had this idea too.  In particular, the following was
recently posted on the math arXiv:

	Norbert A'Campo, A natural construction of the real numbers,
		arXiv:math.GN/0301015 v1  3 Jan 2003.

With regards,
	Ross

This is a reply to Chris Mulvey's and Mamuka Jibladze's messages.


Chris Mulvey's message nicely illustrates Martin Escardo's point
that there are different senses in which one might understand
Cauchy completion.

As Chris confirms, it has long been known that, in toposes not
satisfying number-number choice, the Cauchy reals, i.e. the
set of Cauchy sequences (with modulus) quotiented by the obvious
equivalence, are problematic.

Chris takes Cauchy complete to mean complete w.r.t. "Cauchy
approximations" which he defines as:

> Without countable choice, you still have an inhabited subset of the
> rationals consisting of all rationals at a distance of < 1/n from the
> Dedekind cut. This gives you a sequence of such subsets - a Cauchy
> approximation to the real.

As he remarks, it is well known that the Cauchy reals need not be
Cauchy complete w.r.t. Cauchy approximations. Moreover, their "Cauchy
completion" is the object of Dedekind reals. Thus, any of the familiar
toposes in which Cauchy and Dedekind reals differ (e.g. sheaves on R)
provides an example in which the Cauchy reals are not Cauchy complete
w.r.t. Cauchy approximations.

The above story repeats itself exactly if one changes the meaning
of Cauchy completeness to mean completeness w.r.t. a suitable
notion of "Cauchy" filter.

However, Andrej Bauer was referring to Cauchy completeness in
a different sense. A very natural definition of Cauchy
completeness is to merely require completeness w.r.t. Cauchy
sequences (with modulus) of elements. This is weaker than the
definitions above.

The open(?) question Andrej referred to is to find an example of
a topos (if one exists) in which the Cauchy reals are not
themselves Cauchy complete w.r.t. convergent sequences.
For this, one of course requires a topos in which
the Cauchy and Dedekind reals differ (as the latter are
complete). However, the standard examples of such toposes
(e.g. sheaves on R) do not answer the question, for, in them,
the Cauchy reals do turn out to be complete w.r.t. sequences.

One might object to the above question on the grounds that
completeness w.r.t. sequences is not the "correct" notion in a topos.
There is some validity to this. However, the question originally
arose because Martin Escardo and I came up with a definition of an
"interval object" (an object of a category corresponding to the
closed interval [0,1] in much the same way that a "natural numbers
object" corresponds to the natural numbers) that makes sense in
the very general setting of an arbitrary category with finite products.
When interpreted in Set, the interval object is the interval [0,1].
When interpreted in Top it is the interval with Euclidean topology.
When interpreted in an elementary topos, the interval object
turns out to be the interval [0,1] constructed within the "Cauchy
completion w.r.t convergent sequences of the Cauchy reals within the
Dedekind reals", where the quotes are, once again, because the phrase
needs careful interpretation. For mathematical details, see our paper
in LICS 2001 "A Universal Characterization of the Closed Euclidean
Interval".


Our approach apparently has something to say related to Mamuka Jiblaze's
question. For us the interval is defined as an algebra (implementing
an algebraic notion of convexity) freely generated by the object 1+1.
In Top, one can replace 1+1 by Sierpinski space as the generating
object, in which case the interval with the topology of lower
semicontinuity (equivalently the Scott topology) is obtained. Similarly,
in a topos, one might take non-decidable objects (e.g. interesting
"dominances" in the sense of Rosolini) as generating objects.
We have not pursued this latter direction at all, but it might
be interesting to do so.

I forgot to mention this --- I apologize. In your paper, you work in
Set. Do you think your construction works in any topos? If so, what
would "Cauchy reals" mean precisely in this general context? Thanks.

this will give me negative credits one way or another, but here it goes:

let a = (a_i) be a cauchy sequence of rationals between 0 and 1. (cauchy
means |a_m - a_n| < 1/m + 1/n, as in andrej's message.)

let b = (b_i) be the subsequence b_i = a_{2^i+3}. b and a are equivalent
in the sense from the message, because

     |a_m - b_n| < 1/m + 1/(2^n+3) < 2/m + 2/n

note that

     |b_i - b_{i+k}| < 1/(2^i+3) + 1/(2^(i+k)+3) < 1/(2^i+2)

now define x_i to be the simplest dyadic that falls in the interval
between b_i - 1/2^(i+2) and b_i + 1/2^(i+2). in other words, to get x_i,
begin adding 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8... until you overshoot b_i - 1/2^(1+2). if
you also overshoot b_i + 1/2^(1+2), and the last summand was 1/2^k, skip
it, and try adding 1/2^(k+1), etc. one of them must fall in between. a
less childish way to say this is that x_i is the shortest irredundant
binary (no infinite sequences of 1) such that

     |b_i - x_i| < 1/2^(i+2)

so x =  (x_i) is a cauchy sequence equivalent to b, with

     |x_i - x_{i+k}| <= |x_i-b_i| + | b_i - b_{i+k}| + |b_{i+k} - x_{i+k}| <
                     <  1/2^(i+2) + 1/2^(i+2)        + 1/2^(i+k+2) <
                     <  1/2^i

this means that the first i digits of x_i and x_{i+k} coincide.

now let X be the binary number such that its first i digits are the same
as in x_i, for every i. (if it ends on an infinte sequence of 1s,
replace it by the corresponding irredundant representative.) this is
clearly a constant cauchy sequence equivalent to x, so it is its limit.
since x is equivalent to b

    |b_m - x_n| <= |b_m - b_n| + |b_n - x_n| < 1/2^(m+3) + 1/2^(n+3) +
1/2^(n+2) < 2/m + 2/n

and b is equivalent to a, X is also the limit of a.

is there an error in the above reasoning? i can't find it. on the other
hand, i printed out the paper by alex and martin, and the conjecture is
stated rather strongly, so i guess i must be missing something.

                         ESSLLI 2003

            15th European Summer School in Logic,
                  Language and Information

                    August 18-29, Vienna

                http://www.logic.at/esslli03/

Each year the European Association for Logic, Language and Information,
(FoLLi) organizes a European Summer School (ESSLLI) the main focus of
which is the interface between linguistics, logic and computation.
Courses at foundational, introductory and advanced level are given,
the aim of which is to provide for researchers and postgraduate as well
as advanced master students the possibility to familiarize themselves
with other areas of research, and to enable students and researchers to
acquire more specialized knowledge about topics they are already familiar
with. The school also features several workshops, and a student session
in which Master and PhD students can present their work.

This year the 15th ESSLLI Summer School will take place at the Technical
University of Vienna, the beautiful and cultural capital of Austria.
During two weeks 43 courses will be given. They cover a wide variety of
topics within the combined areas of interest: Language and Logic, Language
and Computation, and Logic and Computation. There will be a series of
invited lectures, and several workshops with open calls for papers.

Please, visit our website at http://www.logic.at/esslli03/ for detailed
information.

For information about FoLLi and the previous editions of ESSLLI see
http://www.folli.org/

Deadline of the early registration: June 15, 2003.

Since the subject has been mentioned, I'd like to point to our
investigation of the semantics of neural networks using category theory.
It started much more recently than Andree's, of which I became aware only
a year or two ago.  We differ somewhat in approach, although we've been
using some of Andree's ideas.

My partner Tom Caudell and I have been doing research in neural networks
for many years, our approach being a combination of mathematics and
cognitive neuroscience.  We started applying category theory in our
semantic modeling a few years ago and are now developing architectures
from it.  Some references are easily accessible on my web page at
http://cialab.ee.washington.edu .  I'm under Affiliate Faculty, and
there's a link to publications near the bottom of my home page.  The
categorical ones are conference papers, toward the bottom of the
publications page (though if you're that interested, please let me send
you a corrected version of the 2000 Como paper).  We welcome feedback as
well as questions.

Mike

the coalgebraic structures are defined using just arithmetic. in the

it means fundamental sequence, with the equivalence relation in the
"lazy" mode, a la bishop, as described in andrej bauer's message.

if my last night's posting makes sense, then these constructivist cauchy
reals make a whole lot of difference, because they really let you avoid
the choice and get limits.

heh, i typed this late, and managed to confuse the basic assumption.
instead of

> let a = (a_i) be a cauchy sequence of rationals between 0 and 1.

let a = (a_i) be a cauchy sequence of *cauchy reals*, i.e. each a_i is a
cauchy sequence of rationals between 0 and 1.

i think the rest goes unchanged: you take a fast converging subsequence
b of a, and then approximate b by irredundant rational prefixes. the
irredundant representation is thus used instead of choice. the
completeness of such representation is the finality of its coalgebraic
structure.

Yes there is an error; but, more importantly, you are not answering
the original question.


Regarding the error, your argument is as follows. You start off with
a Cauchy sequence a = (a_i) of rationals between 0 and 1. Using this
you claim to find a binary expansion X such that X = lim a.
Your construction of X is by:

 > now let X be the binary number such that its first i digits are the
 > same
 > as in x_i, for every i. (if it ends on an infinte sequence of 1s,
 > replace it by the corresponding irredundant representative.)

This is not a valid intuitionistic definition, because the property
of ending in an infinite sequence of 1s is not (logically) decidable.

In fact,the internal statement that every Cauchy real in [0,1] has
a binary expansion fails in many toposes (e.g. it fails in the
effective topos).

As is well known, this can be easily patched by, e.g., allowing 1/2
as an extra digit in binary expansions. Then one does obtain that
every Cauchy real (in [0,1]) has such an "extended" binary expansion.


However, none of this addresses the original question:

 > There seems to be an open question in regard to this, advertised by
 > Alex Simpson and Martin Escardo: find a topos in which Cauchy reals
 > are not Cauchy complete (i.e., not every Cauchy sequence of reals has
 > a limit).

For this question, one must first construct the Cauchy reals R_C,
e.g. as Cauchy sequences quotiented by equivalence, or,
equivalently, as extended binary representations quotiented by
equivalence.

The question is: does every Cauchy sequence (x_i) in R_C have a
limit in R_C?

Here we are not starting off with a Cauchy sequence of rationals;
not even a Cauchy sequence of Cauchy sequences. Instead (x_i)
is a Cauchy sequence of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences.
To construct a limit, one apparently needs some choice to
select representatives from each x_i. Thus it appears that
the Cauchy completeness of R_C should fail in general. We
would like to have an example of a topos in which it does
fail. (Of course if there exists one such example then it
also fails in the free topos with nno, but this is no help.)

I'm sorry, but this won't do. In a topos, equality is equality; you can't
treat it "lazily". So a Cauchy real has to be an equivalence class of
Cauchy sequences, and there is in general no way of choosing a
canonical representative for it. Markov's principle would, I think
(I haven't checked the details), suffice to give a canonical
representation as a binary expansion with no infinite sequence of
1's, and then Dusko's argument would suffice to show that the Cauchy
reals are Cauchy complete. But there are many toposes where Markov's
principle fails.

I doubt very much whether the Cauchy reals occur
as a final coalgebra for anything, in any topos where they fail to
coincide with the Dedekind reals, simply because the Dedekind reals
are likely to be a coalgebra for the same endofunctor (and they're
more "final" than the Cauchy reals). Incidentally, Peter Freyd and
I worked out how to do his coalgebra construction constructively,
and I showed that its final coalgebra is the Dedekind interval in any
topos -- the proof is in the Elephant, at the end of section D4.7.

Dear Bill,

Absolutely not.

Consider the definition of local homeomorphism for a map f: X -> 1. If f is
a local homeomorphism then every x in X has an open neighbourhood
homeomorphic to 1, and you find in fact that f is a local homeomorphism iff
X has the discrete topology.

One way to think of a local homeomorphism f: X -> Y is that the stalk map

   stalk(y) = f^{-1}({y})

is a "continuous map from Y to the class of sets". Of course, the class of
sets is not a topological space. (This isn't just a problem of size - there
really is no suitable topology.) Hence "continuity" here is a new concept
and that is what the definition of local homeomorphism captures. But
intuitively it makes some sense. The definition ensures that if y jiggles
about infinitesimally then the set stalk(y) makes no sudden jumps - no new
elements suddenly come into existence, nor any equalities between elements.

I hope you can see something of this intuition; if not, don't worry but
just stick to the definition.

The definition ensures that each stalk, as a subspace of X, has discrete
topology, so it really is a set, not a more general space. All the
non-discrete topology in X arises across the stalks, as homeomorphic copies
of bits of topology on Y. Topology within the stalks is discrete.

Topos theory is able to make some formal sense of the intuition. There is a
topos E whose class of points (not objects) is the class of sets. It is
called the "object classifier". If I (naughtily, you might think) write Y
for the topos of sheaves over Y, then geometric morphisms from Y to E are
just sheaves over Y. But it is legitimate to think of geometric morphisms
between toposes as continuous maps between their points - this certainly
works for toposes of sheaves over spaces, at least if the spaces are nice
enough (sober). Then geometric morphisms from Y to E should be thought of a
continuous maps from Y to the class of sets, as I said before.

Steve Vickers.

By way of motivating the question posed in the subject line I'll pick up
in the middle of this thread on Dedekind vs. Cauchy reals, which I can't
help much with I'm afraid but which provides a nice jumping off point for=

my real topic nonetheless.

I would bounce this question back to Martin: what did he mean by "the
Dedekind reals" in his attribution to Freyd?

Both the Pavlovic-Pratt and Freyd constructions of the continuum as a fin=
al
coalgebra characterize the continuum only up to its order type (and hence=

up to homeomorphism if we take the usual order topology generated by the
open intervals).  Cuts in the *field* Q of rationals inherit Q's metric,
but cuts in the *poset* Q acquire only topology.

Only with Q qua poset would it be fair to say that either Peter's or our
coalgebraic construction of the continuum "characterized the Dedekind rea=
ls."
The Cauchy completion of the rationals on the other hand requires Q to be=

at minimum a metric space and surely a field if you want to bring in 1/n.=

This distinction constitutes a disconnect between Martin's first two
sentences that subsequent emails are at risk of propagating.

I have not to date seen any really convincing marriage of the algebraic
and coalgebraic approaches to defining real numbers.  The very fact that
algebra produces the field of reals while coalgebra produces the continuu=
m
as understood by descriptive set theorists draws a sharp line right there=

between the two approaches.

The only marriage I'm aware of that even works at all is Conway's elegant=

construction of his surreal numbers.  It is a marriage because (loosely
speaking) the numbers entering on the ends create algebra while those
interpolating their predecessors in the Conway ordering create coalgebra.=

A great virtue of this construction is its complete lack of any distincti=
on
between, or even reference to, algebra and coalgebra, the implicit presen=
ce
of both notwithstanding.

Unfortunately it produces neither the field of reals nor a continuum.

Conway doesn't get the former because just before day omega he has only
produced the ring of binary fractions, those rationals of the form m/2^n.=

Day omega itself however witnesses the birth not only of all the remainin=
g
reals but the first few infinities and infinitesimals, in particular
=B1w and their reciprocals.  This doesn't even form an additive monoid le=
t
alone a ring since w+w for example is not due to arrive for another w day=
s!
Negation is the only arithmetic operation surviving the day-to-day evolut=
ion
of Conway's surreal universe, from its little bang to its apocalyptic Fie=
ld.

Seeking closure, Conway slogs gamely on through *all* the ordinals to pro=
duce
a Field of reals.  (Or rather The Field, the maximal such having been sho=
wn
elsewhere to be unique, if I've understood that correctly.)  This being a=

proper class, not only does it not have the cardinality of the continuum,=

it doesn't have a cardinality at all!

Now I conjecture that stopping just before day \epsilon_0, for the sake o=
f
getting a set, produces a field closed under all functions whose n-th bit=
 is
computable in time f(n) where f is definable in Peano arithmetic.  And it=

may well be that Conway already has a field just before day \omega^\omega=
,
I haven't checked but surely someone has by now (I'm very bad at keeping
up with these things, sorry).

But all this is for naught here, since even the smallest Conway field wha=
tever
it might turn out to be is cannot be Archimedean, for the reason above.
And although it has the power of the continuum it lacks its order type:
with the usual order topology, the Conway continuum becomes totally
disconnected as soon as =B11 appear, and remains that way thenceforth.
Total disconnectedness is not anything a continuum can be proud of.

It seems to me that topos theory, or logic, or something in between if
that makes sense, should have something to say about a gap between the
algebra and coalgebra of the reals.  Algebraically the reals form a field=
,
coalgebraically they form a continuum.

What is the logical strength of the weakest framework identifying these
dual views of the reals?

I meant (and still mean): the underlying object of the final coalgebra
is what topos theorists know as "the object of Dedekind reals" (in an
elementary topos with nno).

In more detail [Freyd & Johnstone, in Johnstone's Elephant, pages
1028-1032]: given a topos with nno, consider the category of
(internal) posets in the topos. In this category, define a
functor. Consider its final coalgebra. Theorem: (1) It exists. (2)
Moreover, the underlying object of the algebra is the Dedekind unit
interval under its natural order. (3) The structure map performs
average (x,y) |-> (x+y)/2 (for full details, see the reference).

Answering the question quoted below, you get all the ingredients you
are looking for: a *set* of numbers (as the underlying set of the
underlying poset of the final coalgebra), its *order* (as the
underlying object of the final coalgebra), and (part of) its
*algebraic* structure (as the structure map of the final
coalgebra). Of course, here "set" means an object of a topos,
e.g. that of classical sets. You get only part of the *algebraic*
structure, but topos logic is strong enough to allow you to fully recov=
er=20
it after you have the final coalgebra in your hands.=20

The Escardo-Simpson approach is similar, but takes a different route
and makes weaker assumptions - I won't repeat the story, which can
be found in the paper whose reference was already given by Alex
Simpson.

It's my understanding that you don't get a field until
(just before) day K for K an inaccessible cardinal number.
I'm not 100% certain about this, however!

In fact not. Markov's principle holds in the effective topos, and
there, unless I'm much mistaken, it is not even true that the map from
binary representations to Cauchy (= Dedekind) reals in [0,1] is epi,
let alone split epi.

The map e : 2^N --> [0,1] defined by

  e x = x_0/2 + x_1/4 + x_2/8 + ...

is epi in the effective topos, but it is not regular epi. In terms of
logic, this means that

  forall a : [0,1]. (not not (exists x : 2^n. (e x = a)))

is valid in the effective topos, but

  forall a : [0,1]. (exists x : 2^n. (e x = a))

is not valid.

While the topic is still hot, I'd like to post two more questions
concerning the various real number objects.

Just to recap, in any elementary topos with nno N we have the Cauchy
reals R_C, the Dedekind reals R_D, and also the "Cauchy-completion
(w.r.t. sequences) of R_C in R_D", as discussed thoroughly in previous
postings. Let's call this latter object R_E.

All three objects are logically defined, and hence preserved by
logical functors between toposes. Martin Escardo and I proved
that R_E is also preserved by inverse image functors of
essential geometric morphisms. (Actually, we proved this for
the closed unit interval I_E in R_E. The result for R_E follows
by exibiting R_E as a coequalizer of two well-chosen maps from
N x I_E to itself.)

QUESTION 1. What preservation results are available for
  R_C and R_D?

Surely something is known about this. I can't, at the moment,
see any reason for them to be preserved by inverse image
functors of arbitrary essential geometric morphisms.


Interesting mathematical differences between the objects arise
when one considers algebraic closure properties of the
complex numbers C_C, C_D and C_E associated with R_C,
R_D and R_E respectively.

In Fourman and Hyland, "Sheaf models for analysis" (Springer
LNM 753, 1979) it is shown that the Dedekind complex numbers
C_D are not in general algebraically closed. This fails
in the strong sense that, in certain toposes, one can actually
exhibit a polynomial that has no root. Thus the fundamental
theorem of algebra does not hold in general for C_D.

On the other hand, in Ruitenberg, "Constructing roots of polynomials
over the complex numbers" (in "Computational aspects of Lie group
representations and related topics", CWI Tract 84, Amsterdam, 1990),
it is shown that the fundamental theorem of algebra does hold
for C_C in any topos. (I first heard about this paper from Fred
Richman. I have never seen it. I have only read its math review,
no.92g:03085.)

The conflicting picture above, leads naturally to:

QUESTION 2. Does the fundamental theorem of algebra hold for C_E?


I would be interested to hear any ideas at all related to these
questions.

[this is a copy of my post of monday morning, which bounced between
bob and me a couple of times, courtesy of our mailers. -- dusko]


thanks for the replies. sorry to clog people's mailboxes, but i'll
permit myself one more post on cauchy.

(i think this does deserve some general interest because we often say
that categories capture real mathematical practices --- but as it
happens, cauchy reals are not complete, and the mean value theorem
fails, and so on. i was hoping to understand where does the usual
intuition of continuum fail, and what categorical property do we need
to do basic calculus. i came to think that coalgebras help with this,
since they capture the various notions of completeness, and wondered
why they don't capture the standard cauchy completeness argument in
this context. hence my post that invoked the reactions.)

one would hope that equality in a topos is widely understood, even by
me. treating fundamental sequences up to an equivalence relation in a
lazy mode just means not taking their quotient, but carrying the
explicit equivalence relation. such structures are commonly considered
in toposes. on the other hand, many constructivists (martin-lof,
bishop) say that this is the way to do constructivist
mathematics. (although i am not sure whether i came to think of cauchy
reals in this way because constructivist education left some trace, or
because undergraduate analysis didn't.)

sorry i didn't make all this clear. martin escardo's remark to which i
responded was rather cursory, he just attributed two things, so i kept
mine short. moreover, toposes were not mentioned, and as far as i
remember, the validity in toposes was not discussed either by freyd,
or by vaughan and me. we all talked about streams of digits and it
seemed to me that we were talking about cauchy reals (the
constructivist ones), until peter johnstone observed that freyd =
dedekind++.

i realized that i typed "let a = (a_i) be a sequence of rationals"
instead of "a sequence of cauchy reals" as soon as i woke up, the
morning after i typed it, and sent a correction a couple of hours
after the post --- but our watchful moderator for some reason didn't
forward it to the list.

in any case, i said i thought that the construction went through for
cauchy sequences of constructivist cauchy reals, as described in
andrej bauer's message:

well, call me irresponsible, but i think that the same idea still
applies: the irredundant coalgebraic reals give canonical
representatives for equivalence classes too. with them, one can prove
completeness as usually.

here is a slight modification of sequences from my previous post. let
Q be the set of rationals between 0 and 1, D <= Q dyadic rationals and
N natural numbers. a cauchy real A is now a subobject of Q^N such that

     exists x in A
     forall x in A holds: |xm - xn| < 1/m+1/n
     forall x in A and all y in Q^N holds: |xm - yn| < 2/m+2/n iff y in A.

consider maps b: Q^N --> Q^N, c: Q^N --> D^N and d : D^N --> Q^N,
defined

     b(x)i = x(2^(i+3))
     c(x)i = p/2^n, such that |xi - p/2^n| < 1/2^(i+2)
                         and  |xi - q/2^m| < 1/2^(i+2) implies m>=n of q>=p
     d(x)i = x truncated after i'th digit

** i claim that the image dcb(A) of A along is a representative of A, ie
**
** 1. it is a singleton, and
** 2. an element of A.

this means that the function dcb : Q^N-->Q^N induces a choice function
from Q^N/~ to Q^N, assigning to each cauchy real a cauchy sequence of
ratioanls representing it.

the proofs proceed like for the corresponding sequences in my previous
post. in particular, for every x,y : A holds

     |cb(x)i - cb(y)i| <= |cb(x)i - b(x)i| + |b(x)i-b(y)i| + |b(y)i-cb(y)i| <
                       <  1/2^(i+2)    + 2/2^(i+3)+2/2^(i+3) +    1/2^(i+2) =
                       =  1/2^i

means that cb(x)i and cb(y)i have the first i digits equal. hence
dcb(x)i =dcb(y)i. since this holds for all i, dcb(x) = dcb(y).

now, as everyone has been pointing out, the dyadic representation
depends on markov's principle. in order to prove that the map c is
total, we need the fact that for every e>0 in Q there is some k such
that 1/2 + 1/4 +...+ 1/2^k > 1-e. in other words, that there is k
s.t. 1/2^k < e. this is *equivalent* to markov's principle.

how bad is markov's principle? well, i think that markov proposed it
as a valid *intuitionistic* principle:

** given an algorithm, if i can prove that it terminates, then i
** should be able to construct its output.

it would be nice to know that this is all we need in order to have
cauchy complete cauchy reals.

also, if this is the case, the challenge topos, where cauchy reals are
not complete, would be the realizability topos invalidating markov:
the cauchy sequence without a cauchy limit would have to be the one
that can be proven different from 0, but cannot be proven apart from
0.

is there still an error? please ignore the trivial ones this time, and
i'll try to learn from errors.

all the best,
-- dusko

I stand corrected. I am confusing the effective topos with assemblies
(or modest sets) over the first Kleene algebra.

This is clearly wrong. Every epi is regular, in a topos.

My original statement was correct. In the effective topos,
the map from binary representations to Cauchy (= Dedekind)
reals is not epi.

I don't see that cb(x)i and cb(y)i have the first i digits equal.
It seems possible to have e.g. cb(x)i = .0111 and cb(y)i = .1000.
Indeed, .0111, although it is sufficiently close to b(x)i to
be the value of cb(x)i, may nonetheless be too far from b(y)i
to qualify as a "simpler" candidate for cb(y)i than .1000.

This problem is not easily repaired. In fact, there is a
fundamental obstacle to this approach. Your argument attempts
to construct a function f: Q^N --> Q^N (in your proof given
by f=dcb) satisfying:

  1. f maps any Cauchy sequence to a Cauchy sequence representing
    the same real number.

  2. All sequences that represent the same real number get mapped to
    a single unique Cauchy sequence representative.

Such an f is tantamount to giving a splitting to the epi

  r: {x: Q^N | x a Cauchy sequence} --> I_C

where I_C is the Cauchy interval. There are many toposes
in which Q^N is basically Baire space and I_C is basically
the closed unit interval in Euclidean space
(e.g. Johnstone's "topological topos", many "Gros toposes").
In such toposes, a splitting of r would
correspond to a non-constant continuous function from the
Euclidean interval to Baire space. This is clearly impossible,
as Baire space is totally disconnected. Furthermore,
in many such toposes (e.g. Johnstone's), countable
choice and Markov's principle both hold.

In conclusion, it is impossible to prove the existence of
an f satisfying 1 and 2 above using intuitionistic logic,
even if one further assumes countable choice and Markov's
principle.


Regarding Markov's principle:

> now, as everyone has been pointing out, the dyadic representation

This is *not* what has been pointed out (whatever you mean
by dyadic representation).

It is well-known that, in general, very many different
versions of Cauchy sequence coincide, including: Cauchy
sequences of rationals, indeed many variants depending on
properties of the modulus; ditto for sequences of dyadic
rationals; nested sequences of closeed proper intervals;
"signed" binary representation, etc, etc.

What I previously pointed out was that the existence of
ordinary binary representations may fail even in the presence
of Markov's principle.

The property quoted is in fact a trivial consequence of intuitionistic
arithmetic alone. It has nothing to do with Markov's principle.
Indeed your function c is total in any elementary topos.

This is a curious paraphrasing. It should rather be:

  "if the algorithm cannot fail to terminate then ..."

It would be nice and may be true. At present we don't have a
single example topos in which the Cauchy reals are not complete
(w.r.t. sequences).

However, there is, as yet, no convincing reason to link Markov's
principle to this question.

Best wishes,

It depends on what you mean by "basic calculus".
Bishop would argue that he can do basic calculus just fine
using a constructive version of the mean value theorem.

This is not to say that you don't have an interesting question;
from the POV of the mathematician on the street (not very theoretical),
classical theorems often follow from constructivist (a la Bishop) one
if you assume that sequentially compact metric spaces are compact
(which means complete and totally bounded to Brouwer and Bishop),
so that might be one place to look.

  Fixed Points in Computer Science
             FICS'03
  A Satellite Workshop to ETAPS'2003
  12-13 April, 2003, Warsaw, Poland


           CALL FOR PAPERS



Aim. Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer
science and logic by justifying induction and recursive definitions.
The construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated
in many different frameworks such as: design and implementation of
programming languages, program logics, databases. The aim of the
workshop is to provide a forum for researchers to present their
results to those members of the computer science and logic communities
who study or apply the theory of fixed points.  Previous workshops
where held in Brno (1998, MFCS workshop), Paris (2000, LC2000
workshop), Florence (2001, PLI workshop). Copenhagen (2002, LICS
workshop).

Topics include, but are not restricted to: Construction and reasoning
about properties of fixed points, categorical, metric and ordered
fixed point models, continuous algebras, relation algebras, regular
algebras of finitary and infinitary languages, formal power series,
word and tree automata, the mu-calculus and other programming logics,
fixed points in process algebras and process calculi, fixed points and
the lambda calculus, fixed points in relation to dataflow and
circuits, fixed points in logic programming, databases and complexity
theory.

Dear Colleagues:

This is an update of the last announcement.

June will be theoretical computer science month at U. Ottawa! The
Field's Institute will sponsor a summer school in Logic and
Foundations of Computation at the University of Ottawa this
summer, June 2-20, 2003.  This program will be hosted by the logic
group in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the
University of Ottawa  (consisting of Philip Scott, Richard Blute,
and Peter Selinger).

The program will consist of 2 weeks of courses for graduate
students, then a week of workshops in several areas of
theoretical computer science.   This program is particularly aimed
at graduate students in mathematics, logic, theoretical computer
science, mathematical linguistics and related areas. The program
culminates in the 18th annual IEEE Logic in Computer Science
(LICS2003) meeting at U. Ottawa June 21-27.  For the latter,
see  http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/als/lics/.

Weeks 1,2:  Each week will consist of two courses (one in the
morning, the other in the afternoon), taught by experts in the
area. We are also expecting visiting experts, who may give
informal seminars as well.   We are planning topics that include:

Week 1: (a) Categorical Logic and type theory and  (b) Linear Logic.

Lectures will be given by our logic group, as well as visiting scholars.
Among the visitors we are pleased to have Thomas Ehrhard (Marseille),
Robert Seely (McGill), and Robin Cockett (Calgary).

Week 2:  (a) Game Semantics   and (b) Concurrency.

We are honoured to announce that Samson Abramsky (Oxford)
and Glynn Winskel (Cambridge), resp.,  will be lecturing
on the two topics above.  We hope to have other distinguished visitors who
will give additional lectures.

Week 3:  Fields Institute Workshops.  These include, among other topics,

June 15-16:  Quantum Programming Languages   (Org:  Peter Selinger),
June 17:  Game Semantics  (In preparation)
June 18-19: Mathematical Linguistics (Org:  J. Lambek)
June 19-20:  Mobility Workshop  (In preparation)

Further details on these workshops will be forthcoming.

Some limited funding scholarships will be made available to
graduate students for attending the summer school.
To apply for this money, we ask that you contact
us and include the following information:

1) A one-page email letter stating your background as well as why you
are interested in attending.
2) The letter should also state whether you have access to any other
funding to attend.
3) An email letter of reference from your supervisor or an appropriate
other person.

Preference will be given to students working in the areas covered by
the Fields Summer School. Applications should be received by
February 28.

Non-students are of course welcome to attend the summer school and/or
workshops; there will be a nominal registration fee for attendance.

For further information to apply, please contact any of us:

Philip Scott  (phil@site.uottawa.ca)
Richard Blute  (rblute@mathstat.uottawa.ca)
Peter Selinger  (selinger@mathstat.uottawa.ca)
