Dear category theorists


I would be interested in knowing a proof of the following fact (due to J.
Smith):

"In a combinatorial model category M (i.e. a locally presentable cofibrantly
generated model category), there are functorial factorizations of a map into
a trivial cofibration followed by a fibration which preserve lambda-filtered
colimits for sufficiently large regular cardinals lambda. The same is true
for the factorizations as a cofibration followed by a trivial fibration."

As far as I know about the proof, it suffices to apply the small object
argument step-by-step and then to use some property of lambda-filtered
colimits. The only property I know close to the problem is that a
lambda-filtered colimits of lambda-presentable objects is lambda-presentable.
But the underlying diagram of a pushout is not lambda-filtered. So I dont
understand...

Thanks in advance. pg.

Dear All,

I am sure the subject matter is news to you all, and I am now  asking for
help. I am sure you would want to know before the axe falls.

Details of the problem are below, but any email or fax  expressing
support  for maths research work at Bangor, and dismay at the proposed
threat to the international research reputation of the University of Wales,
Bangor, would be welcomed by all of us in maths. It could also say that
information on the threat comes from me,  since I have no contract with the
University, and it should ask for this view to be presented to Council at
its meeting on Friday, Oct 4, at 1015 am. The crucial variable is the
number of messages received. These would also be helpful as evidence for
future plans.

Any email or fax should go by tomorrow (Thursday, December 4) at the latest to

Professor Roy Evans,
Vice Chancellor,
University of Wales, Bangor
fax: +44 1248 383 296
email: roy.evans@bangor.ac.uk

Details: Maths has a declining recruitment over the last few years, and it
is in this session under 10. The financial system in place is that maths
get less credit for service teaching than for teaching of students
registered for a maths degree,  and the current situation is worse in that
classes of 60 are taught by maths staff with financial credit going wholly
to the School of Informatics,  and not to the maths group, which is somehow
accounted separately.

In any case, no recruitment budget for maths has been assigned over the
last few years.

Also attacked at Senate was the research reputation of Mathematics at
Bangor, so this is where you can all really help. I was there as an
observer, so did not speak, and am now in a position to argue that Senate
had inadequate information in this respect. So if you have contrary views,
please ask the VC to present these  to Council on Friday morning.

I have proposed that Council should reject the Senate motion, and ask that
adequate funds should be assigned to recruitment in maths with clear and
achievable goals.

The Senate motion is actually to sack some staff and then to ask for
certain milestones, to be achieved, with apparently zero resources.

                   MATHEMATICS OF PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION
                   -----------------------------------

                  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/MPC2004

                  Organised in conjunction with AMAST '04

                            12--14 July, 2004

                          Stirling, Scotland, UK


                             CALL FOR PAPERS


This conference aims to promote the development of mathematical
principles and techniques that are demonstrably useful in the
process of constructing computer programs, whether implemented
in hardware or software.

The focus of the conference is on techniques that combine
precision with conciseness, enabling programs to be constructed by
formal calculation.  Within this theme, the scope of the conference
is very diverse.  We welcome contributions to programming
methodology (for example, formal methods for program specification
and transformation), to programming paradigms (for example,
generic programming techniques and type systems) and to language
design (for example, programming calculi and programming language
semantics).  Theoretical contributions are welcome provided their
relevance to program construction is evident; discussion of
applications is welcome provided the mathematical basis is evident.

The conference will be organized in conjunction with the AMAST '04
Conference. There will also be a number of co-located workshops,
including CMPP.  Proceedings will be published in a volume of
Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science.


                            IMPORTANT DATES

Deadline for submission of papers:     31st January, 2004

It is with deep sadness that I announce to you that Professor
Willem Blok, a renowned mathematician and Professor at the University of
Illinois, died tragically in an automobile accident on November 30.  He
was 56.

In addition to his wife Mary Ogilvie, he is survived by his son Philip,
aged 7, mother Yeltge, and brothers Rieuwert, Jan, Cees, and Gerard.

Many of us knew Wim as a fine mathematician and colleague. In addition to
mathematics, he was an accomplished musician and birder. He traveled the
world, lecturing on mathematics, exploring wild and remote areas, and
observing animals and birds in their natural habitats. Above all he was a
wonderful friend and companion. We will miss him dearly.

There will be a memorial service on Monday, December 8, at 5:00 pm at
Unity Temple, Unity Temple, 875 Lake Street, Oak Park, IL 60301.  Unity
Temple is at the corner of Lake and Kenilworth

Mary has asked that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the
Philip Blok Education Fund for the education of Philip and mailed to Ms.
Carolyn Eloby, Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer
Science, University of Illinois at Chicago, 851 South Morgan, Chicago IL,
60607.

Our deepest sympathy and condolences go out to Wim's family.  This is a
tragedy that will deeply affect many in our field who knew Wim for so many
years.

Dear Colleagues,
  Below is the first announcement about MFPS XX. The meeting will take place
on the CMU campus in May, co-located with the annual ASL meeting that also
will be held on the CMU campus. All interested parties are invited to submit
contributed talks for the open sessions of the meeting.
  Best regards,
  Mike Mislove

=======================================================

                 FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT
                     MFPS 20
             Twentieth Workshop on the
    Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics
             Carnegie Mellon University
                 May 23 - 26, 2004

    Co-located with Annual Association of Symbolic Logic Meeting

The twentieth workshop on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming
Semantics will take place on the campus on Carnegie Mellon University,
Pittsburgh, PA USA from May 23 through May 26, 2004. This year, the
conference is co-locating with the annual meeting of the Association
of Symbolic Logic. For more information about the annual ASL meeting,
see http://www.aslonline.org/

The goals of the MFPS series have been to provide a forum for
researchers in all areas surrounding semantics to present their latest
research results, and to improve communication and interactions
between mathematicians, logicians and computer scientists who work in
these areas. The areas of relevance include category theory, domain
theory, logic and topology on the mathematics side, and type theory,
semantics, and the design, verification and implementation of
programming languages on the computer science side. The meetings
alternate between a large conference format featuring invited speakers
and refereed, contributed papers, on the one hand, and more informal
workshops featuring survey talks by invited speakers and contributed
talks by researchers about their latest research, on the other. MFPS
XX is a workshop year, and so we will follow the workshop format,
including contributed talks by participants (see below).

MFPS XX will feature six invited, plenary talks, each with a
complementary special session on a topic closely related to the
interests of the speaker. The plenary speakers are:

     Christel Baier (Bonn)
     Radha Jagadeesan (DePaul)
     Pat Lincoln (SRI)
     Luke Ong (Oxford)
     Dana Scott (CMU) - Joint ASL/MFPS Lecture
     Alex Simpson (Edinburgh)

As indicated, each of these talks will be followed by a special
session. These sessions and their organizers are:

  Model checking - organized by Professor Baier and Prakash Panagaden (McGill)
  Hybrid systems - organized by Professor Jagadeesan, Michael Mislove (Tulane)
                   and Prakash Panagaden
  Security - organized by Dr. Lincoln and Dr. Catherine Meadows (NRL)
  Game Theory and Semantics - organized by Dr. Ong, Stephen Brookes (CMU)
                              and Michael Mislove
  Domain Theory - organized by Steve Awodey (CMU)
  Topology and Domain Theory - organized by Dr. Simpson and Achim
                               Jung (Birmingham)

In addition to the plenary talks and sessions, the program will
include talks contributed by the participants. Those interested in
participating in the meeting by contributing a talk are invited to
send a title and short abstract to the email address
mfps@math.tulane.edu If a participant believes his or her talk is
appropriate to one of the special sessions, then this should be noted
in the email message. Slots for talks will be allocated on a first
come, first served basis.

MFPS is organized by Stephen Brookes (CMU), Achim Jung (Birmingham),
Catherine Meadows (NRL), Michael Mislolve (Tulane) and Prakash
Panagaden (McGill). The local arrangements for MFPS XX will be
overseen by Professor Brookes.  More information about MFPS XX will be
available on the home page,
http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps20.html when it is available. In
particular, information about lodging, conference registration, and
possible support will be announced there and by additional emails. We
anticipate support from the US Office of Naval Research, and component
of this usually includes support for women, minorities and graduate
students who wish to participate in the meeting.

Questions or comments about the meeting can be directed to
mfps@math.tulane.edu

                          CALL FOR PAPERS

                 Nineteenth Annual IEEE Symposium on
                LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (LICS 2004)

               July  14th - 17th, 2004, Turku, Finland
              http://www.lfcs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/lics/


The LICS Symposium is an annual international forum on theoretical and
practical topics in computer science that relate to logic in a broad
sense.  We invite submissions on that theme.  Suggested, but not
exclusive, topics of interest for submissions include: automata
theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,
concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,
constructive mathematics, database theory, domain theory, finite model
theory, proof theory, formal aspects of program analysis, formal
methods, hybrid systems, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic,
logical aspects of computational complexity, logics in artificial
intelligence, logical representation of knowledge, logics of programs,
logic programming, modal and temporal logics, model checking,
programming language semantics, reasoning about security, rewriting,
specifications, type systems and type theory, and verification.


Important Dates:
Authors are required to submit electronically a paper title and a
short abstract of about 100 words before submitting the extended
abstract of the paper.

 Titles & Short Abstracts Due : January 26, 2004
 Extended Abstracts Due       : February 2, 2004
 Author Notification          : March 27, 2004
 Camera-ready Papers Due      : April 25, 2004

All deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be considered.
Detailed information about electronic paper submission will be posted
at the LICS website.

Submission Instructions:
Extended abstracts must be submitted electronically in the IEEE
Proceedings two-column camera-ready format.  Each abstract must be in
English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee
to assess the merits of the paper. It should begin with a succinct
statement of the issues, a summary of the main results, and a brief
explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference and
to computer science, all phrased for the non-specialist.  Technical
development directed to the specialist should follow. References and
comparisons with related work should be included.  Extended abstracts
may be no longer than 10 pages including references, and must be
formatted in the IEEE Proceedings two-column camera-ready style (IEEE
style files will be accessible from the LICS website).  If necessary,
detailed proofs of technical results can be included in a
clearly-labelled appendix in the same two-column format following the
10-page extended abstract. This material may be read at the discretion
of the program committee.  Extended abstracts not conforming to the
above requirements concerning format and length may be rejected
without further consideration.  The results must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of
other symposia or workshops.  All authors of accepted papers will be
expected to sign copyright release forms.  One author of each accepted
paper will be expected to present it at the conference.


Short Presentations:
LICS 2004 will have a session of short (5--10 minutes) presentations.
This session is intended for descriptions of work in progress, student
projects, and relevant research being published elsewhere; other brief
communications may be acceptable. Submissions for these presentations,
in the form of short abstracts (1 or 2 pages long), should be entered
at the LICS 2004 submission site between March 27th and April 4th,
2004.  Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by April
17th, 2004.


Kleene Award for Best Student Paper:
An award in honor of the late S.C. Kleene will be given for the best
student paper, as judged by the program committee.  For a submission
to be eligible, the research presented in the paper must have been
carried out while all authors were full-time students.  The program
committee may decline to make the award or may split it among several
papers.

Affiliated Workshops:
As in previous years, there will be a number of workshops affiliated
with LICS 2004; information will be posted at the LICS website.

SPECIAL VOLUME OF THEORY AND APPLICATIONS OF CATEGORIES (TAC)
Proceedings, Category Theory and Computer Science CTCS'02

Guest Editors - Rick Blute(Ottawa) and Richard Wood (Dalhousie)

Second Call for Papers


http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/


This special volume of Theory and Applications of Categories is devoted to
the proceedings of the 2002 conference Category Theory and Computer
Science, held at the University of Ottawa. The purpose of the conference
series is the advancement of the foundations of computing using the tools
of category theory. Indeed, category theory provides one of the key tools
in the analysis of the interaction between logic and the theory of
computation. The extent to which category theory has influenced these
areas can be seen from the following list of topics, which are typical of
the interests of this conference:

-coalgebras and computing
-concurrent and distributed systems
-constructive mathematics
-declarative programming and term rewriting
-domain theory and topology
-foundations of computer security
-linear logic
-modal and temporal logics
-models of computation
-program logics, data refinement, and specification
-programming language semantics
-type theory

The list is by no means exhaustive. This special volume is devoted not
just to journal versions of the papers which appeared in the proceedings,
but is intended to showcase papers which emphasize any of the above
topics. Papers will be refereed to the usual high standards of TAC.

* Submission deadline: January 5th, 2004.
* Submissions, in pdf or ps format, should be sent
to Rick Blute at <rblute@mathstat@.uottawa.ca>.
* Questions (e.g., about the appropriateness of a
submission) and comments should be directed to the
same address.
* To expedite handling, authors should prepare their
manuscripts following the instructions for contributors
described in <http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/authinfo.html>
