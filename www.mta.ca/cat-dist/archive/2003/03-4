In 1991 Springer published "Models for smooth infinitesimal analysis" by
Moerdijk and Reyes.  It is now out of print.

Can anyone suggest a source from which I might obtain a used copy? I've tried
Amazon which listed a used copy for sale but it turned out that it had been
already sold.

Title :  Homotopy branching space and weak dihomotopy

Abstract : The branching space of a flow is the topological space of
germs of its non-constant execution paths beginning in the same
way. However, there exist weakly S-homotopy equivalent flows having
non weakly homotopy equivalent branching spaces. This topological
space is then badly behaved from a computer-scientific viewpoint since
weakly S-homotopy equivalent flows must correspond to higher
dimensional automata having the same computer-scientific
properties. To overcome this problem, the homotopy branching space of
a flow is introduced as the left derived functor of the branching
space functor from the model category of flows to the model category
of topological spaces. As an application, we use this new functor to
correct the notion of weak dihomotopy equivalence, which did not
identify enough flows in its previous version.

Dear colleagues,

The following short paper

  Coherence of the Double Involution on *-Autonomous Categories
  by J.R.B. Cockett, M. Hasegawa and R.A.G. Seely

available from the authors' pages

  http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~hassei/papers/#STAR
  http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/

might be of some interest for those woking on proof theory/type theory
and semantics of Linear Logic. It addresses the following "coherence"
question.

Many formulations of proof nets and sequent calculi for Classical
Linear Logic (CLL) take it for granted that a type A is "identical" to
its double negation A^{\bot\bot}.  On the other hand, it has been
assumed that *-autonomous categories are the appropriate semantic
models of (the multiplicative fragment of) CLL. However, in general,
in a *-autonomous category an object A is only "canonically
isomorphic" to its double involution A^{**}. This raises the questions
whether *-autonomous categories do not, after all, provide an accurate
semantic model for these proof nets and whether there could be
semantically non-identical proofs (or morphisms), which must be
identified in any system which assumes a type is identical to its
double negation.

Fortunately, there is no such semantic gap: in this paper we provide a
"coherence theorem" for the double involution on *-autonomous
categories, which tells us that there is no difference between the
up-to-identity approach and the up-to-isomorphism approach, as far as
this double-negation problem is concerned. This remains true under the
presence of exponentials and/or additives. Our proof is fairly short
and simple, and we suspect that this is folklore among specialists,
though we are not aware of an explicit treatment of this issue in the
literature.

Best,

Robin Cockett
Masahito Hasegawa
Robert Seely

HEADLINE: A Plus For Unifying Maths

BYLINE: Peter Munro

BODY: Max Kelly, 72, is modest about his Centenary Medal for services
to mathematics. He described it as an award for the little people.

"It is a simple award for many common people, for little people. It's
not an elite award," he said yesterday from his home in Pymble. "It's
for the people in the world who help here and there."

Mr Kelly helped by forming the Australian Category Theory Seminar in
1971. Category theory is a modern area of study that seeks to clarify
mathematics by uniting its different theoretical streams. The seminar,
run between Macquarie University and the universities of Sydney and
NSW, is now one of the world's leading research centres on category
theory.

"Category theory sheds light on the relations between various aspects
of mathematics and in doing so it brings unity and simplicity," Mr
Kelly said. "It lights the way for the next lot of advances."

He was pleased to be recognised on a list feat uring sportspeople,
actors and politicians.

"I am a bit surprised and rather pleased that they would take into
account scientific achievements."

Scientists in many fields were among the 4491 medal recipients from
NSW: Brian Doyle, from West Pymble, was recognised for his
contribution to the advancement of astronomy; Leslie Field, from Lane
Cove, for services to organic chemistry; Victor Flambaum, from Coogee,
for atomic and nuclear physics.

Mr Kelly said it was important that scientific achievements were
recognised as another form of community work.

"Some people get recognition for helping the community in various ways
but scientific advancement is also important to developing our
country.

"My gifts happen to be in this area. I cannot do anything special for
meals on wheels, but I can in this area."

Hello,

   I have been re-reading the chapter on intuitionism
in Goldblatt's book, specifically the section on
Kripke semantics. Am I wrong to say that Kripke
semantics is based on the Alexandrov topology
generated by the underlying poset?

Regards, Bill

YES, because, given a poset X, the category of sheaves over X equipped=20=

with the Alexandrov topology is equivalent to the category of=20
*covariant* functors  X --> Set.  A very important, basic fact, which=20
is at the foundation of a lot of things in topos theory and computer=20
science.

YES, because it doesn't matter.

Bill's question is not well framed (besides the potential for ambiguity in
the answer arising from "Am I wrong to say that").  Is the question is about
intuitionistic logic/Heyting algebra itself, or its domain of discourse,
ostensibly posetal Kripke structures?  If the former, then the canonical
models obtained by dualizing Heyting algebras are Stone(-Priestley(-Heyting))
spaces, whose topology is compact, the logic being finitary.  If the latter,
and if Stone topology is more bother than discrete topology (surely the case
from a pedagogical standpoint), then the Alexandrov topology is preferable;
this in general is not compact.

But variations between topologies having the same specialization order
describe only what points are approached in the (infinite) limit.  Since
intuitionistic logic is entirely finitary and does not concern itself with
limiting processes, it doesn't matter what topology Kripke semantics is
based on.  Hence YES, Bill is wrong to imply that it does matter (other
than for the secondary reasons discussed above).

Best, Vaughan

CALL FOR PAPERS 32 JAIIO - WAIT 2003
Argentinian Workshop on Theoretical Computer Science
Buenos Aires - Argentina
September 1-5, 2003

Deadline for reception of papers: May 4

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Argentinian  Workshop on  Theoretical Computer Science  (WAIT) has
become an important Latin American forum for the exchange of ideas and
the presentation  of research in theoretical computer  science and its
applications.   The  workshop  aims  are  to build  a  bridge  between
academic and applied  research and to stimulate the  exchange of ideas
and experience between theory and practise in computer science.

The  meeting includes  contributed and  invited talks,  and tutorials.
Further, we are very pleased to  announce that there will be a special
issue of ENTCS (http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs) dedicated to WAIT
2003 publishing a selection of outstanding contributions.

WAIT 2003 (http://wait2003.famaf.unc.edu.ar), the 7-th workshop in the
series, will  be held in Buenos  Aires during September  1-5 (2003) as
part of the 32-nd Argentinian Conference on Informatics and Operations
Research (32 JAIIO, http://www.jaiio2003.uade.edu.ar).

Buenos  Aires  (http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/turismo/en/) is  a
cosmopolitan and  modern urban centre easily accessible  by plane from
most  mayor cities in  the world.   The city  is characterised  by the
multiplicity  of  its artistic  expressions,  ranging  from the  great
assortment  of sculptures and  monuments to  streets and  corners that
surprise with  their allegorical reliefs  and murals.  The  climate of
Buenos Aires ---oceanic  and warm--- is mild all  year round, allowing
visitors to discover the city on  foot in any season.  The city offers
all categories of  accommodation, and food ---which is  something of a
cult--- is of high quality.

TOPICS

Submissions are welcome in all fields of Theoretical Computer Science.
Specific topics of WAIT 2003 include (but are not limited to):

  * Logical and algebraic  foundations of computer science (logics for
    computation, category theory, relation algebras, type theory);

  * Formal methods (formal  specification of sequential and concurrent
    programs, analysis,  verification and transformation  of programs,

Varieties of algebras when viewed as categories can be unexpectedly
equivalent. For a reason explained at the end, I was looking at
varieties of unital rings satisfying the equations  p = 0  and
x^p = x, one such variety for each prime integer  p.

The equivalence type of these categories is independent of  p. The
easiest way of establishing that is to show that each is equivalent to
the category of Boolean algebras (a well-known fact when  p = 2) and
all the equivalences can by established by just one functor. Given a
unital ring, R, define  B(R)  to be the boolean algebra of its central
idempotents where the meet of  a  and  b  is  ab  and the join is
a + b - ab. Then the restriction of  B  to the  p'th variety described
above is always an equivalence of categories.

The fastidious will note (one would certainly hope) that  B  is not a
functor in general (homomorphisms don't preserve centrality). But in a
ring "without nilpotents" (that is, in which  x^2 = 0  implies  x = 0)
all idempotents are central. The equations  x^p = x, of course, imply
the absence of nilpotents.

(Given  p  the inverse functor to  B  can be described as follows: for
a Boolean algebra  C  consider the set of  "p-labeled partitions of
unity", that is, the set of functions  f:Z_p  ->  C  whose values are
pairwise disjoint and have unity as their join. Given two such, f  and
g, define their sum by setting  (f+g)i  to be the join of the set
{ fj ^ gk | j+k = i }  and their product by setting  (fg)i  to be the
join of  { fj ^ gk | jk = i }.)

I was looking for examples of equational theories with unique maximal
consistent equational extensions. The best known example is the theory
of lattices: every equation consistent with the theory of lattices is
a consequence of distributivity. (Inconsistent in the equational
setting means that all equations can be proved, or equivalently, the
one equation  x = y  can be proved.) That is, the unique maximal
consistent extension of the theory of lattices is the theory of
distributive lattices (fortunately this is independent of your choice
of whether top and/or bottom are considered to be part of the theory
of lattices). A less-well-known example is the theory of Heyting
algebras: every equation consistent with the theory of Heyting
algebras is a consequence of the law of double-negation:
(x -> 0) -> 0 = x. That is, the unique maximal consistent extension of
the theory of Heyting algebras is the theory of Boolean algebras.

This search for examples was sparked by what I consider a great
example -- not to be described here -- in "algebraic real analysis".
The only other examples I've found are the theories of unital rings of
characteristic  p, one such example for each prime  p. To shift to the
traditional language here, any polynomial identity consistent with
characteristic  p  is a consequence of characteristic  p  and the
identity  x^p = x.  A lot of examples. But, then again, maybe just one
example.

The equivalence of these varieties for all p is well known. It's best
understood by seeing that they are all dual to the category of Stone
spaces: given a Stone space, the ring of continuous Z_p-valued functions
on it (where Z_p is given the discrete topology) is a ring satisfying
p1=0 and x^p=x; conversely, given such a ring, its prime (=maximal)
ideal spectrum is a Stone space.

Not having my copy of "Stone Spaces" to hand as I write this, I can't
remember whether this fact was in the book. But it certainly should have
been.

When looking for the examples I mentioned in my last post, I had in
mind examples where the unique maximal consistent extension, of an
equational theory is finitely axiomatizable

If one drops that condition there are many more examples, and one of
particular interest: the theory of lattice-ordered unital rings. This
theory does have a unique maximal consistent extension but it is very
much not finitely axiomatizable. For any integer polynomial, P, the
non-existence of a root for  P  is equivalent with the equation
1 = (1 meet P^2). (Conversely, whether any equation holds -- indeed,
whether any universally quantified sentence in this theory holds -- is
equivalent to a Diophantine problem,)

Vaughan has asked if one can determine a minimal theory whose unique
maximal consistent extension is the theory of distributive lattices.
To my surprise the answer is yes. Indeed, there are exactly two such
theories (minimality not defined by number of equations but by their
deductive strength). One is the set of five equations:

     x meet 1 = x,
     x meet 0 = 0,
     1 join 1 = 1,
     1 join 0 = 1,
     0 join 0 = 0.

The other, of course, is obtained my interchanging meet and join,
0 and 1.

Two comments on Peter's posting.  First the particular example he mentions
was apparently first discovered by a French mathematician named Batbedat.
Second, there is an example of an infinitary theory whose category of
algebras is equivalent to the category of sets!  Simply take the
underlying functor to sets represented by an infinite set and prove it is
tripleable using Beck's PTT (very easy).  The theory has as n-ary
operations all functions X --> X^n where X is the representing set.

To expand on what I said about equivalent varieties, a French
mathematician named Batbedat showed many years ago that for any prime p,
the category of p-rings (a p-ring satisfies px = 0 and x^p = x) is
equivalent to the category of 2-rings, that is boolean rings.

i think of these equivalences as sort-of "morita equivalences" between
lawvere-style algebraic theories.  for any finite k, the category of
sets of cardinality a finite power of k has splitting-idempotents
completion the category of finite sets.

An invariant way to see the particular equivalence discussed is to
note that the topos of presheaves on the category of finite sets
is the classifying topos for p-algebras for any given p > 1.
That is because any non-empty set is a retract of a finite power of
p and because left-exactness is equivalent to preserving finite
products in this particular case.

This representation suggests a different interpretation from the
usual "truth of properties" point of view concerning the essential
content of Boolean algebra. Namely, it concerns finite partitions
of a hypothetical whole and shuffling of these induced by arbitrary
maps between the index sets for the partitions, nothing more.

Coordinatizing the above shuffling of partitions using p = 3
has some advantages over p = 2, namely, the unary operations of the
theory suffice to characterize ultrafilters, i.e. to insure that
perceived points of a finite set are actually there; more formally,
the contravariant functor represented by 3 from finite sets to M-sets is
full where M is the 27-element monoid of these unary operations.

Vaughan has noticed that I hadn't broken the commutative habit. So let
me start again. He asked if one can determine a minimal equational
theory with the theory of distributive lattices as its unique maximal
consistent extension. Yes, here's an example:

     x meet 1 = x,
     x meet 0 = 0,
     1 join 1 = 1,
     1 join 0 = 1,
     0 join 1 = 1,
     0 join 0 = 0.

(I was missing the penultimate equation.) There is a Klein-group's
worth of variations. One operation simultaneously interchanges meet
and join, 0 and 1. Another operation simultaneously interchanges the
arguments of the operators. I'll hazard that the resulting four
theories are the only ones that do the trick.

There are many examples of functors between equational classes F:V -> W
that are defined by letting F(A) be the free W-algebra on the elements of
A modulo an equivalence generated by certain expressions of the form:

w(v(a)) = w'(v'(a)).

Here, w, w' are tuples of W-words, v(a) and v'(a) are tuples of V-words
that we fill in in all possible ways with elements of A.

A nice example is Joyal's definition of the "spectrum" functor from
commutative rings to distributive lattices.  Here, F(A) is the free
distributive lattice on the underlying set of A, modulo the relations:

1 = top,
0 = bottom,
a*b = a inf b,
a+b sup a sup b = a sup b.

(Under strong enough set-theoretic assumptions, F(A) is the distributive
lattice of compact opens in the spectrum of A, and if we let 'a' stand for
the element of F(A) corresponding to an element a from A, then 'a' may be
identified the "cozero" set of a.)

Several similar examples of spectrum functors defined by generators and
relations appear in Johnstone's book on Stone spaces.  There are many
other examples, e.g., free group over a monoid, group rings,
booleanization of a lattice.  There are also examples from K-theory (the
Steinberg group, I believe---but now I'm recalling very old stuff so don't
pin me down).  Less well-known, there a kind of universal valuation that
I've been interested in, which is a functor from commutative rings to
lattice-ordered monoids defined by letting F(A) be the free commutative,
totally distributive lattice-ordered-monoid with infinity on A modulo:

1_A = 0_F(A),
0_A = infinity,
a *_A b = a +_F(A) b,
a +_A b geq a sup_F(A) b.

(These, of course, are equational versions of the usual conditions for a valuation.)

My question is, has there ever been an attempt to make a general theory
about functors of this kind? Any relevant references that anyone knows
about?

2nd Call for Papers: [ Apologies for multiple copies ]

                Workshop on

           CATEGORICAL METHODS
                   FOR
 CONCURRENCY, INTERACTION, AND MOBILITY

  Marseille, France, 6 September, 2003

affiliated with CONCUR 2003 and held together with GETCO 2003

(See also: http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk/events/cmcim03)

Aims and Scope:

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers applying
category theory to concurrency, interaction, or mobility. Topics of
interest include, but are not limited to:

  categorical algebras of processes
  categorical methods in game semantics and geometry of interaction
  categorical models of term/graph rewriting or rewriting logic
  Chu spaces
  coalgebras, bialgebras, coinduction
  comparing models of concurrency
  enriched categories of processes
  interaction categories
  presheaf models


GETCO'03:

Due to the close relation between geometric and topological methods on
the one hand and categorical methods on the other hand, CMCIM'03 will
be held jointly with the workshop on Geometric and Toplogical Methods
in Concurrency Theory (GETCO'03). Both workshops will be on the same
day with their talks not overlapping.

Hello,

   I have started reading the stuff on internal
language in McLarty's book and also in the
Lambek/Scott
book. I am trying to short circuit my learning a
little (in a vast and humbling subject!) What are the
models for topos logic? The class of Heyting algebras?

Regards, Bill
