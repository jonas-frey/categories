It seems that you can modify the construction of the localic Diaconescu
cover to get an open surjective _filtered_ cover of a Grothendieck topos
Sh(C).

Instead of using the category String(C) of strings in C, you could
construct the category Tree(C) of finite, rooted, binary trees in C. If
given c and d in C you can find e such that e --> c and e --> d then
Tree(C) is a poset with binary upper bounds, i.e. a filtered category.

Could anyone provide a reference for such a construction?

Grateful for any help,
Jonas Eliasson

While writing a joint paper with Steve Awodey, we came to think about the
following question:

Given a Grothendieck topos Sh(C), what logic is preserved by the
associated sheaf functor from Sh(C) to the double negation subtopos of
Sh(C)?

We know that a: Sh(C) --> DNSh(C) preserves geometric logic. Since it is
double negation it also preserves 0 (falsehood), negation and implication.
>From this you can draw the conclusion that a preserves the validity of
formulas built up from double negation stable predicates without universal
quantifiers.

Presumably this has been studied in the literature, can something stronger
be said about what validities are preserved, could anyone provide a
reference for a general result of this kind?

Grateful for any help,
Jonas Eliasson

Hi Tom,

The category UNIF of uniform spaces, without a separation axiom, is
topological over sets, and hence complete and cocomplete, with concrete
limits and colimits.  UNIF=A0is not cartesian closed.

Cook and Fischer, Math. Ann. 173 (1967), 290-306, defined uniform converg=
ence
structures of a set X as sets \scrF of filters on XxX satisfying five
axioms.  With the obvious definition of uniform continuity, sets with a
uniform convergence structure in this sense form a topological category
over sets, but Gazik, Kent and Richardson in Bull.Austral.Math.soc 11 (19=
74),
413-424, showed that this category is not cartesian closed.

In LNM 378, 591-637, I replaced the Cook-Fischer axiom that the principal
filter generated by the diagonal of XxX is in \scrF by the less demanding
axion that the principal filter generated by (x,x), for every x \in X,
is in \scrF.  This is now part of the accepted definition of uniform
convergence spaces.  In Bull.Austral.Math.Soc. 15 (1976), 461-465 my
student R.S. Lee showed that the category of uniform convergence spaces
with this definition is cartesian closed; this is not the cartesian close=
d
hull of UNIF.

For quasitoposes, we must go to semiuniform spaces which have partial
morphisms -- relations (m,g) with m an embedding -- represented by
one-point extensions.  Semiuniform convergence spaces and their uniformly
continuous maps form a quasitopos, but not the quasitopos hull of UNIF.
This has been determined by Ad=E1mek and Reiterman, The quasitopos hull o=
f
the category of uniform spaes -- a correction, in the journal Topology
and its Applications.

For more information and literature, see my book Lecture Notes on Topoi
and Quasitopoi.

The inclusion of double-negation sheaves is an example of what I
called a sub-open map in my paper "Open maps of toposes"
(Manuscripta Math. 31 (1980), 217-247). Sub-open maps have the
property that their inverse image functors commute with implication
-- indeed, one could take that as a definition, although it
wasn't how I defined them in the paper.

CALL FOR PAPERS
AMAST 2004: 10th International Conference on
Algebraic Methodology And Software Technology
http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/events/amast2004/
Paper Submissions: 19th January 2004
---------------------------------------------

AMAST 2004
July 12th - 16th, 2004
Stirling, Scotland, UK.

SPEAKERS
--------
* Roland Backhouse (Nottingham)
* Don Batory (Texas)
* Michel Bidoit (CNRS)
* Muffy Calder (Glasgow)
* Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen)
* JJ Meyer (Utrecht)

The major goal of the AMAST Conferences is to promote research that may
lead to the setting of software technology on a firm, mathematical
basis. This goal is achieved by a large international cooperation with
contributions from both academia and industry. The virtues of a software
technology developed on a mathematical basis have been envisioned as
being capable of providing software that is (a) correct, and the
correctness can be proved mathematically, (b) safe, so that it can be
used in the implementation of critical systems, (c) portable, i.e.,
independent of computing platforms and language generations, and (d)
evolutionary, i.e., it is self-adaptable and evolves with the problem
domain.


TOPICS
------
As in previous years, we will invite papers reporting original research
on setting software technology on a firm mathematical basis. We expect
two kinds of submissions for this conference: technical papers and
system demonstrations. Of particular interest is research on using
algebraic, logic, and other formalisms suitable as foundations for
software technology, as well as software technologies developed by means
of logic and algebraic methodologies. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to, the following:

SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY:

    * systems software technology
    * application software technology
    * concurrent and reactive systems
    * formal methods in industrial software development
    * formal techniques for software requirements, design
    * evolutionary software/adaptive systems

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY:

    * logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms
    * constraint programming and concurrency
    * program verification and transformation
    * programming calculi
    * specification languages and tools
    * formal specification and development case studies

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS:

    * logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra
    * algebraic foundations for languages and systems, coinduction
    * theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning
    * logics of programs

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers):

    * software development environments
    * support for correct software development
    * system support for reuse
    * tools for prototyping
    * component based software development tools
    * validation and verification
    * computer algebra systems
    * theorem proving systems


PUBLICATION
-----------
As in the past, the proceedings of AMAST 2004 will be published by
Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

We invite prospective authors to submit electronically previously
unpublished papers of high quality. Submissions should not have been
published and should not be under consideration for publication
elsewhere.  Papers must be no longer than 15 pages (6 pages for
system demonstrations) and should be prepared using LaTeX and the
LNCS style that can be downloaded from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

Please send a fully self-contained PostScript file to
amast@cs.stir.ac.uk. If for any reason it is impossible to submit
a paper electronically, authors should send six copies of their
submission to the program chair at the address below. All papers
will be refereed by the programme committee, and will be judged based
on their significance, technical merit, and relevance to the
conference. Papers should be received by January 19, 2004.

Address for non-electronic submissions:
Charles Rattray
AMAST'2004 Program Chair

Dear All,

Is anybody aware of a variant of the "plus" construction giving the
"associated separated  presheaf" wrt to a Grothendieck topology  which
works on a basis as only piece of data (ie without generating the whole
topology and then applying the classical plus functor)? Any hint welcome...

Cheers

Krzysztof

The workshop is held in conjunction with

                ETAPS 2004 (7th European Joint Conferences on Theory
                Theory and Practice of Software, March 27- April 4,2004)
                http://www.lsi.upc.es/etaps04/


AIMS AND SCOPE

During the last few years, it is becoming increasingly clear that a
great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition systems,
automata, process calculi and class-based systems can be captured uniformly
as  coalgebras. Coalgebra is developing into a field of its own interest
presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a growing field of applications
and interactions with various other fields such as reactive and interactive
system theory, object oriented and concurrent programming, formal system
specification, modal logic, dynamical systems, control systems, category
theory, algebra, analysis, etc. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its
applications.

 The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
   - the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
     approaches);
   - coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
     languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
   - coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
   - coalgebras and data types;
   - (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
     bisimulations or invariants);
   - coalgebras and algebras;
   - coalgebraic specification and verification;
   - coalgebras and (modal) logic;
   - coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid
      systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, Genova, Grenoble, and Warsaw. The proceedings appeared as
"Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS)", Volumes 11,
19, 33, 41, 65.1 and 82.1. Selected papers have been/are being published in
Theoretical Computer Science, Theoretical Informatics and
Applications, and Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.

Let P be a presheaf on the site (C,J) and consider the "classical" plus
construction

  P^+(c) = colim_{R \in J(c)}Match(R,P)

where Match(R,P) is the set of matching families for the cover R \in
J(c) and the colimit is taken over J(c) ordered by reverse inclusion
(cf. McLane & Moerdijk) . This is a nice filtered colimit so x \in
P^+(c) can be expressed as an equivalence class of matching families.

 Suppose now that J is given by a basis K. It is not immediately clear
(at least not for me) what happens in a variant of the above where
Match(R,P) is taken as the set of matching families for the K-cover R.
Indeed, the notion of "common refinement"  for K-covers is not as handy
as the one for J-covers for the task at hand since op-ordering K-covers
will not necessarily give a filtered category. The other obvious
candidate for a "category K(c)" where a factorisation witnessing a
refinement (of K-covers) is a morphism (in the opposite category) will
probably fail to be filtered as well, so I wondered if anybody allready
looked at such things.

I agree that a one-sentence prose might have been a bit messy...

Cheers

Krzysztof

Dear all, I put a recent paper (just submitted)
in the math Arxiv at
http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.CT/0309209

Your comments are most welcome.
Thanks.
Vincent.

*Title:* Flatness, preorders and general metric spaces

*Author:* Vincent Schmitt <http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/author/Schmitt-V*>
*Categories:* CT Category Theory <http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.CT>

    *Abstract:* This paper studies a general notion of flatness in the
    enriched context: P-flatness where the parameter P stands for a
    class of presheaves. One obtains a completion of a category A by
    considering the category Flat_P(A) of P-flat presheaves over A. This
    completion is related to the free cocompletion of A under a class of
    colimits defined by Kelly. For a category A, for P = P0 the class of
    all presheaves, Flat_P0(A) is the Cauchy-completion of A. Two
    classes P1 and P2 of interest for general metric spaces are
    considered. The P1- and P2-flatness are investigated and the
    associated completions are characterized for general metric spaces
    (enrichemnts over R+) and preorders (enrichments over Bool). We get
    this way two non-symmetric completions for metric spaces and
    retrieve the ideal completion for preorders.

Call for Papers:

International Workshop on Graph Transformation and Visual Modeling
Techniques

http://www.upb.de/cs/ag-engels/GT-VMT04/

A satellite of ETAPS, March 27 - 28 2004, Barcelona, Spain
supported by the SegraVis resarch training network

http://www.segravis.org

Scope and Objectives

Effective applications of visual modelling techniques require tool
support at a semantic level, e.g., for model analysis, transformation,
and consistency management. Due to the variety of languages and methods
used in different domains, an engineering approach is required which
allows for the generation of such tools from high-level specifications.

Graph transformations provide means to specify, at a conceptual level,
complex operations on diagrams. Complementing this by techniques like

    * meta modelling (including OCL)
    * compiler construction
    * logic and algebraic semantics

the workshop aims to bring together researchers from different
communities to discuss their respective contributions to different
aspects of modelling and modelling languages, like

    * syntax and well-formedness,
    * static and dynamic semantics,
    * analysis and verification,
    * refinement and transformations, and
    * integration and consistency of models.

History

This workshop is the third in the series of GT-VMT workshops:

    * GT-VMT 2000 in Geneva (Switzerland) at ICALP'00.
    * GT-VMT 2001 on Crete (Greece) at ICALP'01.
    * GT-VMT 2002 in Barcelona (Spain) at ICGT 2002.

Program Committee

The PC consist of members of the graph transformation community and
external experts for complementary techniques and application areas.

    * Jan Aagedal (Norway)
    * Luciano Baresi (Italy)
    * Andrea Corradini (Italy)
    * Jose Fiadeiro (UK)
    * Martin Gogolla (Germany)
    * Martin Gro=DFe-Rhode (Germany)
    * Reiko Heckel (Germany) [chair]
    * Uwe Kastens (Germany)
    * Joost Kok (The Netherlands)
    * Mark Minas (Germany)
    * Andy Sch=FCrr (Germany)

Submission

Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of 5 to 10 pages in
ENTCS format until December 19, 2003 electronically via our submission
web form (to be published here in due time). The contributions should
report about ongoing research in the areas of graph transformation and
visual modeling techniques according to the scope and objectives of the
workshop. Position papers and contributions making methodological
statements are strongly encouraged.

Accepted contributions will appear in an issue of Elsevier's Electronic
Notes in Theoretical Computer Science. A preliminary version of the
issue will be available at the workshop.

I'm interested in  duality theory for an arbitrary category,
especially for "classical" algebraic categories( e.g., SEMI, the
category of semigroups and their homomorphisms).

I want to obtain such result: to build general "dualization
algorithm" (for varieties), and "to hang" fundamental
operations and identities at each step of this "algorithm", where they
arise.

But I haven't possibility to get books
(I'm think these books would help me)
such as
Borceux, "Categorical Algebra";
Clark/Davey, "Natural Dualities for the Working Algebraist";
Johnstone, "Stone Spaces";
Manes, "Algebraic theories"
and more others.

IS THERE DUALITY THEORY FOR THE CATEGORIES described above?


               -------------------------------------------------------------
My ideas in this direction are restricted only by the next:
1. Using factorization systems(in particular, via congruences lattice)
   for the category of algebras(but HOW in general situation, without
   special methods?)
2. Using inclusion of the category TH^op
   (considering as theory in the sense of (Barr/Wells)'s "Toposes, triples and theories")
   in the category MOD(TH) of models for this theory.
3. Via iso of categories (SET^(W))^op = CABA_(W^op)
  (for given endofunctor( or, narrow concept, functor part of triple) W on SET).
4.(main!!) Via generalization of the standart duality example
  (ComRing1)^op ~=~ AffSchemes
  What is the role of Birkhoff's subdirect representation theorem for
  algebras in the construction of the topological space SPEC, how we
  can construct (in general situation) the sheaf of algebras on this
  space?
  And the main: what the grounds of this construction( if it is
  possible)?
  How to prove directly the duality between algebraic and geometric
  theories ( if it is available)?
--------------
The next questions/exersices  parallels this "algorithm":
A.
  The best test for this general theory --- to apply it for the  well-known
  duality  (ComRing1)^op ~=~ AffSchemes, mentioned above.
B.
  If (4.) is available, how we can in general terms to obtain the equivalence
  between the category CABA_(W^op) in (3.) and the correspondent
  category given by construction in (4.)?
C.(deeper)
  How the duality theory connect algebra, logics and topology?
D.
  What is this "algorithm in terms 2-categories?"

I was looking for a reference (or correction!) to the following observation
in indexed category theory.

Let E be a cartesian category and H an E-indexed category (that is H is a
functor from E^op to CAT, where CAT is some background category of possibly
large categories).

Then, if C is an internal category in E we have a categorical equivalence

Nat[Cat(_,C),H]=H(C_0)

where C_0 is the object of objects of C. The objects of Nat[Cat(_,C),H] are
the natural transformations and the morphisms are the modifications (see,
e.g. definition B1.2.1(c) in Johnstone's Elephant).

On objects, this equivalence is just Yoneda's lemma, so surely it has been
observed already that it extends to this 2-categorical statement?

Best wishes, Christopher Townsend

Try, for example, Theorem (5.15) of

13. Cosmoi of internal categories, Transactions American Math. Soc.
258 (1980) 271-318; MR82a:18007.

PS Allow me to correct an annoyingly wrong gratuitous word on the
same page as that Theorem; the word "full" should be deleted on the
second line of (5.13).

Hello,

I'm moving to Scotland to start a new life.  My address there is

t.leinster@maths.gla.ac.uk

and my web page, once I arrive and set it up, will be linked to from

My IHES email account will probably expire in a month or so (and my
Cambridge account as soon as anyone notices I haven't been there for a
year and takes exception).

To all category theorists:

In various textbooks, I see reference to the common comma category Elts(G),
which is called the "category of elements of functor G". This category seems to
be drastically misnamed. Does anyone agree? Here is my side of the story,
beginning with a review of the nature of Elts(G) and some of its significance.

G is a functor from a small category C into the category F of small
functions. Denoting the singleton {0} of the void set 0 by 1 (as usual), Elts(G)
consists of all triples (g,a,f) with a in the domain category C and
g:1--->G(codomain a), f:1--->G(domain a) such that g = G(a) o f, where "o" denotes function
composition. (Warning: By my conventions, a.domain a = a; codomain a.a = a.) The
composition of Elts(G) is defined by (h,b,g)(g,a,f) = (h,ba,f). The objects
are the Elts(G)-morphisms of the form (f,u,f), where u is a C-object, and the
map (f,u,f)-->f(0) identifies each of these with an element of the set G(u), so
that the convention of naming categories after their objects (to the extent
possible) is what presumably leads to calling Elts(G) "the category of elements
of the values of G at objects" or, for short, "the category of elements of G".

Several basic features of Elts(G) are exposed by treating it as a subcategory
of a product BxC of a transition category B with the domain category C of G.
To define B, let X be the set of functions f:1--->G(u) as u varies over the
objects of C; B is then the full transition category or groupoid of X, that is,
the self-product XxX with the transition composition (h,g)(g,f) = (h,f). But
rather than taking the ordinary cartesian product for BxC, one uses the
attachment product consisting of those triples (g,a,f) with (g,f) in B and a in C, so
that C-morphism a is viewed as being attached on its left to g and on its
right to f. Then Elts(G) inherits by restriction the projection functor
(g,a,f)-->a, which is reasonably called the detaching functor from Elts(G) into
C---this functor will be generically denoted by "det".  There is also the transition
projection (g,a,f)-->(g,f) which maps Elts(G) functorially onto a transitive
relation on X, and the rule (g,a,f)-->g defines the entwining function of the
canonical natural transformation which entwines the constant functor
(g,a,f)-->1 on Elts(G) with the function composite functor G o det: Elts(G)--->F. (A
constant functor with value 1 will be denoted generically by "delta(1)".)

There are many important examples: If C is a group with object e so that G is
group action with action set Y=G(e), then, to within the identification
(g,a,f)-->(g(0),a,f(0)), Elts(G) is the traditional idea of a G-action as a
function from CxY into Y after correction to remove the categorically problematic
product CxY. If C is actually the group RxR, R being the additive group of real
numbers and G the action of C on the real affine plane by translation, then
Elts(G) is essentially the category of attached planar vectors as used in
Engineering Statics 101, which is why it seems appropriate to continue to use the
word "attach" in the context of a more general function-valued functor G:C--->F.
If C is a certain type of monoid, then Elts(G) is a semiautomaton. Among its
theoretical services is the fact that Elts(G) plays a role in the construction
of Kan extensions along inclusion functors, thus in particular in the theory
of induced group actions. It plays an analogous part in sheafification relative
to a Grothendieck site, and it is used to show that representable functors
are dense in the set of function-valued functors on C, providing, according to
Mac Lane and Moerdijk, "a plethora of tensor products". Even more basically, if
the domain C of G is discrete, then Elts(G) is a coproduct a.k.a. a disjoint
union of (the object values) of G. As will be noticed in a moment, the set of
functors A:C--->Elts(G) which are right inverse to the detaching functor det
on Elts(G)---that is, the "attaching functors" into Elts(G)---constitute a
(small) limit object of G, thus, in the case of discrete C, a product of the sets
G(u). From these examples it appears that Elts(G) is sufficiently important to
require a unique and unambiguous nomenclature, but, unfortunately, the things
in Elts(G) are really not the elements of G.

The (global) elements of an object u in a category are generally agreed to be
the morphisms from a given terminal object t to u. This convention
terminologically extends the observation that the functions f from the terminal object 1
into a (small) set X can be identified with the elements of X by the mapping
f-->f(0). The general definition has the virtue that each terminal object has
only one element, as should surely be the case, and the representable functor
of t provides a plausible (but not necessarily effective) attempt to convert a
given category into a category of functions between sets of elements. In
fact, this language seems to have found broad acceptance. But then the functor G
is an object in the morphismwise (i.e. "vertical") composition category F^C of
natural transformations whose (fully extended) entwining functions map from C
into F, and, because 1 is terminal in F, the constant functor delta(1) on C is
terminal in F^C. So G already has a set of elements, namely, those natural
transformations which entwine delta(1) with G. Such elements of G are not in
Elts(G) in any sense.

At first sight this terminological conflict might seem to be innocuous, since
Elts(G) and global elements of G occur in somewhat disparate contexts, but
the apparent separation does not hold up well when one considers how close the
set of global elements of G is to being a limit object of G. The only problem
with it is that it is not small; that is, it is not in the codomain category F
of G, and the only reason for this defect is that F, the common codomain of
the entwining functions of the things in F^C, is not small. Mac Lane in CWM
gives an ad hoc workaround which replaces, for a given G, the category F with a
small, G-dependent category of small functions, but this approach effectively
isolates G by artificially depriving it of morphisms into functors which do not
happen to map into Mac Lane's ad hoc replacement category; so one needs a more
perspicuous method of eliminating F and its untoward largeness.

F. W. Lawvere was apparently motivated by such considerations to introduce
comma categories in his thesis, an approach which works very well in addressing
the present awkwardnesses. One defines a category Law(C) whose objects are the
categories Elts(G) as G ranges through the functors in F^C and whose
morphisms are the cocompatible functors S:Elts(G)--->Elts(H) between such objects. The
composition is function composition of functors, and "cocompatible" means
that S does not disturb middle components of attached C-morphisms or,
alternatively put, det o S = det, where "det" continues to be the generic symbol for a
detaching functor. Then, if s in F^C entwines functor G with functor H, there is
a cocompatible functor S:Elts(G)--->Elts(H) which is evaluated at an attached
C-morphism (y*,a,x*) by

S(y*,a,x*)=(s(codomain a)(y)*, a, s(domain a)(x)*),

where I use y*, for example, to denote that function f:1--->G(codomain a)
whose value is y. Then the assignments s-->S define a functorial
isomorphism---which I call the Lawvere isomorphism (but should this be attributed to someone
else?) from F^C onto Law(C). Moreover, the objects Elts(G) of Law(C) are small.
This implies, of course, that the homset of cocompatible functors from
Elts(G) into Elts(H) is also small.

Elts(delta(1)) evidently consists of triples of the form (0*,a,0*) and can
thus be identified with C by the detaching functor (0*,a,0*)-->a on
Elts(delta(1)). With this identification, a cocompatible functor from Elts(delta(1)) into
Elts(G) becomes an attaching functor into Elts(G), so that, in the Lawvere
picture, the global elements of G are the attaching functors into the category
of...uh...elements of G. The set of such global elements is plainly small and
therefore must be what God intends to be the standard limit object of G, except
that it is difficult to believe that God would use such a verbal collision to
say what a global element is. These are my grounds for believing that Elts(G)
has to be renamed and redenoted.

As a related suggestion, I might recommend dropping the habit of referring to
categories by the names of their objects. This illogicality immediately
inhibits use of the subcategory concept (I still don't know what categorists use to
refer to the subcategory formed by the monomorphisms in an abstractly given
category), and then it just goes looking for the sort of trouble which has
turned up as "the category of elements of G". Besides this, the terminology "comma
category" is disrespectful of category theory, itself, due to the
inappropriateness of naming a fundamental, overarching categorical concept after a
punctuation mark. ("Slice category" doesn't seem to be any better.) Given the
precedent of attached vectors, which are used in a rough sense even by sophisticated
diagrammaticists, the category Elts(G) is obviously some kind of attachment
category, and since the transition components of any of its morphisms all have
domain 1, it is a based attachment category with base 1 or just a basement
category---or even just a basement denoted by something like G/1, if you're used
to placing domains on the right. Anyway, this is approximately what I use in
my study notes, and so far it works fine.

At the same time, I would be interested in seeing sharp, well reasoned
criticisms of this note provided that they are written at about the same technical
level so that I can understand them. I would like to emphasize that, aside from
what may be terminologically or notationally novel here, I am not making a
substantial research proposal or claiming priority for any discoveries. I have
no reason at all to doubt that all of the mathematics here is well known.
