I wonder whether anyone has done an investigation (in either a journal
paper or web-accessible lecture notes) of the way in which

        the natural numbers object has to be re-defined
                in categories with weak logic.


It is well known, for example, that in a category that (has finite
products but) is not cartesian closed, parameters have to be added
explicitly to the definition, yielding a diagram of the form

                zero                 succ
        Gamma --------> N x Gamma <-------- N x Gamma
          ||                .                   .
          ||                .                   .
          ||                . rec               . <left, rec>
          ||                .                   .
          ||    base        V        step       V
        Gamma ----------->  X  <------------- N x X

(where, as in proof & type theory, I use Gamma for an arbitrary
object, or context of parameters).

If the category is cartesian closed then this diagram may be
rewritten with  the exponential  X^Gamma  in place of  X,  the
object Gamma itself being removed from the top line.

The corresponding recursion scheme is written symbolically as

    Gamma  |-  base : X        Gamma, n:N, x:X  |-  step (n,x) : X
    --------------------------------------------------------------
               Gamma, n:N  |-  rec (n, base, step) : X

with beta-rules
    Gamma       |-  rec (zero,    base, step) = base : X
    Gamma, n:N  |-  rec (succ(n), base, step) = step (n, rec (n, base, step))

By the way, we call this "recursion at type X", the point being that
as the class of types at which the recursion scheme is asserted grows,
so considerably does the power of the logic.

A similar generalisation is needed when we want to argue about equations:

 - I have terms     Gamma, n:N, x:X  |-  a_n,  b_n : X,

 - I prove a base case        Gamma  |-  a_0 = b_0 : X

 - and an induction step that
        Gamma, n:N, x:X,   a_n = b_n : X  |-    a_n+1 = b_n+1 : X

 - From these I want to deduce that   Gamma, n:N, x:X  |-  a_n = b_n : X
   without assumption.

Notice that I said nothing about how  a_n  and  b_n  themselves were
defined.  Indeed, if they had been defined by the same base and step
maps on X, they would be equal by the uniqueness hypothesis of the
universal property - otherwise known as the eta rule for recursion.


To give a simple example to show that we need more than this uniqueness,
let b_n=b be constant and
        a_0 = f u,  a_1 = f(s u),  a_2 = f(s(s(u)), etc
where
        f: X---> Y   and    s : Y ---> Y
so that the sequence  a_n  itself is not defined by an endofunction.

We can apply the ordinary recursion scheme to this example by considering
the subtype or equaliser
                                                  f
                                                ------>
        Z  =  { y:Y | f y = b }  >------>   Y          X
                                                ------>
                                                  b

since the endofunction  s : Y --> Y  restricts to  Z.

In fact, the general equational recursion scheme can be derived from
a different equaliser:
                                                          a_n
                                                        ------>
        E = { n:N | a_n = b_n : X}  >------> Gamma x N          X
                                                        ------>
                                                          b_n

The base case says that  zero : Gamma x N -> N  factors through E,
whilst the induction step says that  succ  restricts to  a map  E -> E.
Then the above parametric recursion scheme provides an inverse
        rec_E : Gamma x N ---> E
to the inclusion, one equation being given by uniqueness of
        rec_N : Gamma x N ---> Gamma x N
and the other by the fact that  E >--->  Gamma x N  is mono.


As you may have guessed, I became concerned by this issue because
I am interested in a certain category that does not have general
equalisers, so I will need to assert a more complicated recursion
scheme in my case.


These two generalisations of the beautifully simple Dedekind -- Peano
-- Lawvere definition of the natural numbers are beginning to feel
like the thin end of a wedge.  Presumably be have to make a further
alteration to the definition for every propositional and type
connective in our logic.

Alternatively,  we can consider the situation in set theory or an
elementary topos.  The equational recursion scheme is valid there
because we have equalisers, and we may consider in particular the case
where X = Omega is the subobject classifier and b_n=true.  This gives
Peano induction straight away.

We get from a given category to the topos situation by means of a
Yoneda embedding, though unfortunately not simply into a presheaf
topos or functor category. There has to be a Grothendieck topology to
make the representable object N from our category coincide with the
constant sheaf whose value is N from Set.

Actually, we can unwind this situation and re-express it in terms of
elementary category theory or type theory.  Let
        Gamma,  n:N  |-  phi(n)
be the predicate that we want to prove generally true by induction.

This predicate, like any term, may be shifted from one context Gamma
to another one Delta by a multiple substitution of a term using
variables from Gamma for each typed variable in Delta. Categorically,
this just means the composite

                    u x id              phi
        Delta x N  --------> Gamma x N -----> Omega

Now  phi  may actually be true in some particular context  Gamma,
but not in another one  Delta.    Those contexts in which it is true
form a category, or alternatively a sheaf or sieve on the original
category.  This sieve is the truth-value of phi in the sheaf topos.


I think symbolic logic has language for this situation, possibly
involving the word "realises", but I'm not sure at the moment what
this is.

Let S be this sieve.

Like E above, it has a map (natural transformation)  E ---> N.

If the sieve S is representable by an actual subobject of N in the
original category, the same argument as above provides an inverse
N ---> S, whence S is the whole of N.   (A sieve S is representable
by an object U if S consists of all of the maps into U).

We can see parametric and equational recursion in terms of this sieve.

In the equational case,   S  consists of all maps to Gamma x N that
have equal composites with  a_n  and  b_n.  The sieve is representable
iff it has a terminal object, which is called the equaliser.

In the parametric case,  the terminal object of the sieve is the
exponential   X^Gamma.


The general form of the recursion scheme in a category with weak logic
that we do not want to embed in a topos therefore appears to be this:

        N admits recursion at the sieve (cf type) S

for whatever generality of sieves we care to choose.

Since a sieve is the external manifestation of a subset in the topos,
what we have said is that any sieve (of the chosen generality) that
contains zero and is closed under successor is the whole of N.
In other words, N admits induction or is well founded with respect
to such sieves as predicates.

Maybe I've just answered my own question, but if someone else has
worked on this and written it up more fully then I would like to know.

SUMMER SCHOOL

Inspired by the success of the graduate student preconference of CTCS'02 in
Ottawa, the CTCS of this year will have a similar event: A summer school
from August 9-11. The goal is to prepare students - both graduate and
undergraduate, with basic knowledge of category theory - for CTCS, through
mini-courses in the basic areas underlying some of the fields of the
conference. We anticipate offering courses in among others the following
areas:

Coalgebras
Game Semantics
Categorical Models for Concurrency
Operational Semantics in Concurrency

	The complexity of the contributions on this subject seem unlikely to
encourage applicable category theory. Quantum Logic is perhaps a prime
example where CT can deal directly with 'non-locality' without recourse to
quasi-linear reductions like the non-distributive orthocomplemented modular
lattice. That may be the accepted interpretation but not for its scientific
merits more from an argument ad hominem as it arose from a particular
thought experiment of von Neumann.
	QL in CT via Hilbert spaces is to model a model. A stream can never
rise higher than its first spring, said Francis Bacon at the outset of
modern science.  Surely QL is much better represented by the higher internal
logic of a general topos as it satisfies the correspondence principle. The
non-distributive lattice version on the other hand cannot.
	The papers
<http://computing.unn.ac.uk/staff/CGNR1/liege_quantum02.pdf>
	<http://computing.unn.ac.uk/staff/CGNR1/liege_quantum03.pdf>
	discuss for a BCS Cybernetic Machine Group publication how CT can
subsume the various interpretations to help achieve quantum computation in
natural computing. These draw on the neutral concept of the anticipatory
system introduced by Rosen who has advocated the use of CT for representing
life systems.
	Quantum logic is in a class of modern 'non-local' problems like
natural language, information theory, globalisation, social systems, etc
that could be greatly advanced by the use of applied category theory.
Unfortunately there appears to be no readily available treatise on CT that
is not heavily couched in  'local' set-like language and able to pass the
adequacy test of Bacon.

Position Description
====================

The Coordination and Component Based Software group in SEN3 at CWI
has two open positions for:

        (1) a postdoc for a period of four years, and
        (2) a PhD student (OIO) for four years.

Both positions are within the project number 600.065.120.03N02
Compositional Construction of Component Connectors (C-Quattro), recently
funded by the NWO (the Dutch government's funding agency for academic
scientific research), with F. Arbab (CWI) and J. Rutten (CWI and VUA) as
Principal Investigators.  The project C-Quattro is in fact
a collaboration of SEN3 at CWI with the Section
Theoretical Computer Science at the Free University of Amsterdam (VUA).
The postdoc will be employed by CWI; the PhD student will be employed
by the VUA but will spend part of his or her time at CWI.

The main goal of the C-Quattro project is to develop an operational
semantics based on a calculus of component connectors, as the foundation
for further development of practical tools and programming environments
for the actual deployment of Reo.  Reo is a recently introduced
channel-based coordination model wherein complex coordinators, called
connectors, are compositionally built out of simpler ones.
Reo is intended as a ``glue language'' for construction of connectors
that orchestrate component instances in a component-based system.
The emphasis in Reo is on connectors and their composition only,
not on the components that are being connected.

The activities under C-Quattro involve both system oriented
and theoretical work.  On the systems side, we develop tools
supporting visual connector programming, as well as the automation of
equivalence proofs, e.g., for optimization.  On the theoretical side,
the semantic modeling is based on the coalgebraic methodology,
and coinduction, with its potential for automation, will be
the main reasoning principle.

The candidate for the postdoc position is expected to have a strong
background in Software Engineering, maturity in formal methods and
their practical applications, familiarity with component-based software,
concurrency, and coordination.  Teamwork and leadership, as well as the
ability to work effectively with academic colleagues and PhD students,
are all important qualifications for this position.

The candidate for the PhD position should have a master degree
in computer science or mathematics, with a clear
interest in questions from theoretical computer science.
Ideally, the candidate has a background both in mathematical
disciplines such as algebra, analysis and discrete mathematics,
and in such elements of theoretical computer science as
automata theory and semantics.

The Theme SEN3 (http://www.cwi.nl/sen3) at CWI is a dynamic group of
internationally recognized researchers who work on Coordination Models
and Languages and Component-Based Software Composition.  The activity
in SEN3 is a productive, healthy mix of theoretical, foundational,  and
experimental work in Computer Science, ranging in a spectrum covering
mathematical foundations of models of computation, formal methods and
semantics, implementation of advanced research software systems, as well
as their real-life applications.

Hello,
 In the following reference

[1]  B.J. Day, On closed categories of functors, Lecture Notes in
Math 137 (Springer, 1970) 1-38

are defined promonoidal, or monoidal enriched categories. It seems that
there should be some well known many object version of this, in the sense
that a bicategory is the many object version of a monoidal category. Does
anyone know a definition or, even better, a reference?
 A much later related definition is in the appendix of

[2] V. Lyubashenko, Category of $A_{\infty}$--categories,
    Homology, Homotopy and Applications 5(1) (2003), 1-48.

Here are defined enriched 2-categories. This seems to be the strict case
of what I'm looking for, since a promonoidal category is a monoid in the
category of enriched categories, or a one-object category enriched over
V-Cat. In [2] enriched 2-categories are defined as enriched over V-Cat.

Thanks,
 Stefan Forcey

Brian Day put out a short preprint:

	Brian J. Day, Biclosed bicategories: localisation of convolution,
	Macquarie Mathematics Reports #81-0030 (April 1981)

but it was (allegedly) too far ahead of its time to be published.
Here "biclosed" means that all right extensions and right liftings
exist. So a one-object "biclosed bicategory" is a monoidal category
with both left and right internal homs.

In the short paper he defines what I think is exactly what you want
and calls them "probicategories".  By performing convolution on the
homs one obtains biclosed bicategory which is locally cocomplete.

In more recent work, Brian and I have found something more general
than probicategories to be useful. Again, afraid of going too
general, we have concentrated on the one object case; thus we have
things called "substitudes" which are lax versions of promonoidal
V-categories. They also generalise Lambek's multicategories. For the
promonoidal case of a substitude, the multihoms are all determined up
to canonical isomorphism by the nullary, unary and binary homs. See
for example:

72. (with B.J. Day) Lax monoids, pseudo-operads, and convolution, in:
"Diagrammatic Morphisms and Applications", Contemporary Mathematics
318 (AMS; ISBN 0-8218-2794-4; April 2003) 75-96.

77. (with B.J. Day) Abstract substitution in enriched categories, J.
Pure Appl. Algebra 179 (2003) 49-63.

The natural level of generality for the subject of

70. (with G.M. Kelly, A. Labella and V. Schmitt) Categories enriched
on two sides, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 168 (1) (8 March 2002) 53-98

seems to be substitudes-with-several-objects rather than
bicategories. I actually wrote some draft sections on that during the
writing of [70] but we chickened out.

Best wishes,
Ross

AIMS AND SCOPE


Rewriting logic (RL) is a natural model of computation and an expressive
semantic framework for concurrency, parallelism, communication and
interaction. It can be used for specifying a wide range of systems and
languages in various application fields. It also has good properties as a
metalogical framework for representing logics. In recent years, several
languages based on RL (ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been designed
and implemented. The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers
with a common interest in RL and its applications, and to give them the
opportunity to present their recent works, discuss future research
directions, and exchange ideas.

The topics of the workshop comprise, but are not limited to,

* foundations and models of RL;
* languages based on RL, including implementation issues;
* RL as a logical framework;
* RL as a semantic framework, including applications of RL to
   - object-oriented systems,
   - concurrent and/or parallel systems,
   - interactive, distributed, open ended and mobile systems,
   - specification of languages and systems;
* extensions of RL, including
   - real-time and probabilistic extensions,
   - tile logic,
   - rewriting approaches to behavioral specifications;
* verification techniques for RL specifications, including
   - equational and coherence methods, and
   - verification of properties expressed in modal and temporal logics;
* comparisons of RL with existing formalisms having analogous aims,
  including
   - rho-calculus,
   - structural operational semantics,
   - concurrency calculi,
   - dynamic algebras.

Themes: The SPIN workshop is a forum for practitioners and researchers
interested in model checking based techniques for the validation and
analysis of communication protocols and software systems. Techniques
based on explicit representations of state spaces, as implemented in the
SPIN model checker or other tools, or techniques based on combination of
explicit representations with symbolic representations, is the focus of
this workshop.It has proven to be particularly suitable to analyze
concurrent asynchronous systems. The workshop will focus on topics
including theoretical and algorithmic foundations and tools, model
derivation from code and code derivation from models, techniques for
dealing with large and infinite state spaces, timing and applications.
The workshop aims to encourage interactions and exchanges of ideas with
all related areas in software engineering.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solicited Contributions: SPIN 2004 solicits previously unpublished,
currently unsubmitted, original contributions addressing theoretical,
experimental and applied problems in model checking of software
artifacts. Particular topics include:
- model checking based tools, tool extensions and comparative studies
- theoretical & algorithmic foundations of model checking based analysis
- combination of model-checking techniques with other analysis techniques
- model checking of programming languages and code analysis
- techniques for analyzing and testing large and infinite state systems
- model checking in the system life-cycle
- innovative applications of model checking, including
    * model checking of object-oriented and component based systems
    * model checking of security systems
    * model checking of real-time systems
- engineering of model checking tools and platforms

The following preprint is available (in pdf and ps):

Marco Grandis

Equilogical spaces, homology and noncommutative geometry
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 491 (2003), 24 p.

Abstract. After introducing singular homology for D. Scott's equilogical
spaces, we show how these structures can express 'formal quotients' of
topological spaces, which do not exist as ordinary spaces and are related
with well-known noncommutative C*-algebras.
This study also uses a wider notion of local maps between equilogical
spaces, which might be of interest for the general theory of the latter.

MSC: 18B30, 54A05, 55U10, 55Nxx, 46L80.
Keywords: Equilogical spaces, cubical sets, singular homology,
noncommutative C*-algebras.

The workshop is held in conjunction with

                ETAPS 2004 (7th European Joint Conferences on Theory
                Theory and Practice of Software, March 27- April 4,2004)
                http://www.lsi.upc.es/etaps04/


AIMS AND SCOPE

During the last few years, it is becoming increasingly clear that a
great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition systems,
automata, process calculi and class-based systems can be captured uniformly
as  coalgebras. Coalgebra is developing into a field of its own interest
presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a growing field of applications
and interactions with various other fields such as reactive and interactive
system theory, object oriented and concurrent programming, formal system
specification, modal logic, dynamical systems, control systems, category
theory, algebra, analysis, etc. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its
applications.

 The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
   - the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
     approaches);
   - coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
     languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
   - coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
   - coalgebras and data types;
   - (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
     bisimulations or invariants);
   - coalgebras and algebras;
   - coalgebraic specification and verification;
   - coalgebras and (modal) logic;
   - coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid
      systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, Genova, Grenoble, and Warsaw. The proceedings appeared as
"Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS)", Volumes 11,
19, 33, 41, 65.1 and 82.1. Selected papers have been/are being published in
Theoretical Computer Science, Theoretical Informatics and
Applications, and Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.

You can get an idea of the types of papers presented at previous meetings
by looking at the tables of content of the above ENTCS volumes from these
meetings. They are available via the ENTCS page
