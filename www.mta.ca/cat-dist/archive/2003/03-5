If R is a ring (commutative, with 1), there is a certain sense in which
the structure sheaf, a local homeomorphism E -> Spec(R) (making the
Zariski spectrum a local ringed space) is the free local ring over R.

Can this be made to work more generally for localic rings R? (Other than
in trivial ways, by taking the set of points of R.) Or for particular
classes of localic rings (e.g. compact regular)? Is there a Zariski
spectrum? Presumably the analogue of the structure sheaf would not be a
local homeomorphism any more.

For every set Z, there is a self-adjoint contravariant functor Q=ENS(--,Z),
with unit/counit h:Id-->Q^op Q given by (h_X)(x)(f)=f(x).  Let Q-alg denote
the category of algebras for the monad induced by this self-adjunction.
If Z is not empty or a singleton, then the comparison functor ENS^op-->Q-alg
is an equivalence by results of M. Sobral.  If Z has two members, then Q-alg
is isomorphic to CaBool, the category of complete atomic Boolean algebras.
What is known about Q-alg if Z has more than two members (beyond the fact
that Q-alg and CaBool are equivalent)?

The following preprint is available:

M. Grandis
Directed combinatorial homology and noncommutative tori
(The breaking of symmetries in algebraic topology),

Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 480 (May 2003), 29 p.

Abstract.

   This is a brief study of the homology of cubical sets, with two main
purposes.

   First, this combinatorial structure is viewed as representing *directed
spaces*, breaking the intrinsic symmetries of topological spaces. Cubical
sets have a *directed homology*, consisting of preordered abelian groups
where the positive cone comes from the structural cubes.

   But cubical sets can also express topological facts missed by ordinary
topology. This happens, for instance, in the study of group actions or
foliations, where a topologically-trivial quotient (the orbit set or the
set of leaves) can be enriched with a natural cubical structure whose
directed cohomology agrees with Connes' analysis in noncommutative
geometry. Thus, cubical sets can provide a sort of 'noncommutative
topology', without the metric information of C*-algebras.

MSC: 55U10, 55Nxx, 81R60.
Keywords: Cubical sets, combinatorial homology, noncommutative spaces,
directed algebraic topology.

The operations of Q-alg are the functions between the powers of the set Z,
forming the (Lawvere) theory T of Q-algebras, which are product-preserving
functors from T to Set.  (So if Z is 3 then there are 27 = 3^3 "Boolean"
operations in place of the familiar 4 = 2^2.)  With all powers Q-algebras are
equivalent to CABAs, with only finite powers and finite-product-preserving
functors they are equivalent to Boolean algebras.

A natural next question would be, what is obtained when T is taken to be
Set itself, in each of the cases when the functors T->Set are required to
preserve all limits, and just the discrete ones?

Dear Colleagues,

I'm very happy to announce the availability of my book,

"Higher Operads, Higher Categories".

It is available electronically now, and will appear in traditional print
form later in the year.  The electronic version is at

http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0305049

and the nice bound version is

Tom Leinster,
Higher Operads, Higher Categories,
London Mathematical Society Lecture Notes Series,
Cambridge University Press,
ISBN 0-521-53215-9.

Details of the latter will appear at the CUP website (www.cambridge.org),
and it can also be pre-ordered from the usual on-line book stores.

The existence of the electronic version is by arrangement with CUP, more
on which below; first, some mathematical details.


SUMMARY

Higher-dimensional category theory is the study of n-categories, operads,
braided monoidal categories, and other such exotic structures.  It draws
its inspiration from areas as diverse as topology, quantum algebra,
mathematical physics, logic, and theoretical computer science.  This is
the first book on the subject and lays its foundations.

The heart of this book is the language of generalized operads.  This is as
natural and transparent a language for higher category theory as the
language of sheaves is for algebraic geometry, or vector spaces for linear
algebra.  It is introduced carefully, then used to give simple
descriptions of a variety of higher categorical structures.  In
particular, one possible definition of n-category is discussed in detail,
and some common aspects of other possible definitions are established.

Many examples are given throughout.  There is also an introductory chapter
motivating the subject for topologists.

The arrangement with CUP is that I can post a "preprint" version of the
book on the archive now, and then one year after the book has been
published in traditional form, I can update the archive version to agree
with it.  All I've done in return is to give up my royalties (10% of the
profit; there goes my fortune).  This is something of an experiment on
CUP's part: they initially said that it would hurt their sales too much to
have a free electronic version available, then I tried to persuade them
that it might actually help sales, not hurt them, because of the extra
exposure it would get.  There's also the consideration that a 400-page
printout is unwieldy and the book is low-price, so the incentive for
readers to buy is quite high.

In any case, I think that CUP deserve a great deal of credit for being
willing to try this, and I'd be pleased if those who can afford to bought
a copy rather than just using the printout; this would reflect the
goodwill and perhaps encourage CUP to extend this arrangement to other
authors. It'll be about 30 pounds (45 euros or US$) - and as I said, I
make no money from this.

>(So if Z is 3 then there are 27 = 3^3 "Boolean" operations in place of
>the familiar 4 = 2^2.)

There should have been a "unary" in there of course.

Another question about these Q-algebras that Oswald Wyler was asking
about: what is a necessary and sufficient condition for a complete basis
for finitary Q-algebras (the theory of Boolean algebras rather than CABAs)
having any given Z?  For Z = 2 one answer (at least for the version of the
problem which only considers nonzeroary operations) is that for each of the
following properties the basis must contain a counterexample to that property.
Necessity follows because each property is preserved under composition;
sufficiency takes more work.

  * selfdual (e.g. xy+yz+zx = (x+y)(y+z)(z+x))
  * monotone
  * affine (expressible as the XOR of its arguments, optionally plus 1)
  * strict (maps the all-zeros input to zero)
  * costrict (maps the all-ones input to one)

(NAND violates all five at once.)  Is there a fixed number of such properties
that works for all finite cardinalities of Z, or must the number of properties
of this kind grow with Z?

Hi Vaughan,

Regarding these and similar questions, I suggest looking at the following
two gems:

A. L. Foster, Gerneralized "Boolean" theory of universal algebras, Part II.
Identities and subdirect sums of functionally complete algebras, Math. Zeit.
59, 1953, 191-199.

T.-K. Hu, Stone duality for primal algebra theory, Math. Zeit. 110, 1060,
180-198.

I am gratified to announce that I already have a dozen or more volunteers
and that would seem to be enough.  More will increase the coordination
problem, of which I have begun thinking might not be trivial.

Thanks again to all the willing volunteers.

Michael

As discussed his week  by Oswald Wyler, Vaughan Pratt, and Ernie
Manes, the opposite of the category of small sets is equivalent to
the algebras over the monad T obtained by dualizing into Z   for
Z>1 ; there is really no difference which Z is used. But that
changes if we consider a truncation of T, i.e., the part supported by
arity I for some I (the truncated monad has value at X equal to the
union of the images of  T(I)--> T(X) over all I-->X). There is still the
possibility that some subcategory  of sets will be full in the
opposite of the category of algebras. For example, as Vaughan
points out, if Z=3, I=1, at least the finite sets can be so captured.

An important way to capture all small sets is to take Z=2 and I=
countable (Ulam) or Z=countable and I=1  (Isbell in 1960 showed
that these are equivalent).  Taking unary operations (I=1) is always
possible by enlarging Z. (For some reason Ulam spoke of
measures, which is really quite misleading because measures
are additive but here the condition that they be multiplicative is at
least as important; likewise the set -theorists' terminology
"measurable" (for sets too big to be captured) is misleading
because "to be capturable" is intuitively to be measurable by
procedures valued in Z.)

I advocate that an additional axiom on small sets is that all such
monads (Z infinite, I=1) should be the identity, because all known
constructions of geometry and analysis preserve capturability and
moreover all mathematical situations where one can reasonably
expect a space/quantity duality are spoiled without this axiom on
the underlying discrete sets. It is well known that the negation of
the axiom, as applied to all sets, implies its consistency.
Recognizing a category of small sets, so defined, as an ordinary
object in the cartesian-closed category of categories of course in
no way prevents the consideration of possible much larger sets or
categories in the same system, no more than does recognizing
the category of finite sets.

Author : Philippe Gaucher

Title :  A long exact sequence for the branching homology

Abstract : A function complex is introduced on the category of flows
so that the model category of flows becomes a simplicial model
category. This allows us to show that the homotopy branching space of
the cone of a morphism of flows is homotopy equivalent to the cone of
its image by the homotopy branching space functor. The crux of the
proof is that the homotopy branching space of the terminal flow is
contractible. We then easily deduce a long exact sequence for the
branching homology of a flow.

 =20
The systems engineering method proposed in this book, which is based
on Abstract State Machines (ASMs), guides the development of software
and embedded hardware-software systems seamlessly from requirements
capture to actual implementation and documentation. Within a single
conceptual framework it covers design, verification by reasoning
techniques, and validation by simulation and testing. ASMs improve
current industrial practice by using accurate high-level modeling and
by linking the descriptions at the successive stages of system
development in an organic and efficiently maintainable chain of
rigorous and coherent system models at stepwise-refined abstraction
levels. =20

This book combines the features of a textbook and a
handbook. Researchers will find here the most comprehensive
description of ASMs available today and professionals will use it as a
"modeling handbook for the working software engineer." As a textbook
it supports self-study or it can form the basis of a lecture
course. The book is complemented by a CD containing the whole book
text, additional course material, solutions to exercises, and
additional examples.

Lecture notes and additional material are freely available=20

Dear all,

We would like to invite you for the 79th meeting of the Peripatetic
Seminar on  Sheaves and Logic, which will be held in the weekend of the
28th and 29th of  June near Utrecht, the Netherlands. It is organized by
the University of Utrecht  with financial support of the MRI, the
Mathematical Research Institute.

As a special attraction, Clemens Berger will give a tutorial on
theta-categories, a topic from higher-dimensional category theory.

For the entire weekend, we will stay at the conference centre "Kaap
Doorn", near  Utrecht (www.kaapdoorn.nl), which can easily be reached by
public transport.

Concerning these and other matters a webpage can be consulted, one that
is at  the moment under construction. The address will be:

http://www.math.uu.nl/people/vdberg/PSSL79

Here we will also announce the precise costs for the stay at the
conference  centre.

People who wish to attend the PSSL should send an e-mail to the address
below.  Please indicate if you want to give a talk.

With best regards,

The organizers,

Jaap van Oosten

It is well known that epimorphisms in rings do not have to be surjective.
Suppose C is a category and R is a ring object in C. I am looking for a
name to call maps X --> Y in C with the property that Hom(Y,R) -->
Hom(X,R) is epic in rings.  It is a kind of weak R-injectivity.  Does
anyone have a name for this?

Michael

Hi,

How can I show that, in a connected category, projections (of the
product) are epimorphisms?

Thank you,

 Flavio Leonardo.

The quickest natural example I know of a connected category in which
projections from products needn't be epi is the category of
commutative rings. Well, actually, the opposite category.  The
coproduct of  Z_2  and  Z_3  is the terminal ring. The two
co-projections fail to be monic (the coproduct of a pair of objects in
this category is their tensor product).

Of course it depends rather heavily on what you mean by connected:

(1) if you mean that there is a way to get between any two objects via
arrows -- and one is allowed to go backwards along arrows -- then this
is not true.  Any category with products is necessarily connected in
this manner and the category of Sets provides a counter-example.
Any projection p_0: A x 0 -> A where 0 is the empty set and A is
non-empty is non-epic.

(2) if you mean that given any objects A and B there is always an arrow
f: A -> B (differs from (1) in that you are not allowed to go backwards
along arrows) -- that is homsets are non-empty -- then this IS true.
This is because every projection in such a category has a section as the
composite
          <1_A,f>          p_0
       A --------> A x B --------> A

is the identity. This makes the projection a retraction and thus epic.

(2) if you mean (stretching a bit) that every object has a (regular)
epic onto the final object (all objects have global support) then all
you need in addition is that the product functors _ x A preserves these
epics.  This will be the case, for example, if the category is cartesian
closed ... however, such a category better not have an initial object!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ETAPS main conferences accept two types of contributions:

*   Research papers;
*   Tool demonstration papers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Research papers:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English presenting
original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted
for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the
same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.

The proceedings will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series. Final papers will be no more than 15 pages
long in the format specified by Springer-Verlag at
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.
It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length.
Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately.

Instructions on how to submit are available at the URL of each individual
conference.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tool demonstration papers:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Demonstrations of novel and state-of-the-art tools are also invited.
A submission should have a clear connection to one of the
main ETAPS conferences, possibly complementing a paper submitted separately=
=2E

Tool demonstrations are an integrated part of the ETAPS programme.
Selected demonstrations will be presented in ordinary conference sessions,
using state-of-the-art projection. The time allowed will be approximately
the same as that for the presentation of a research paper. The demonstratio=
n
will be accompanied by the publication of a short paper (up to 4 pages) in
the proceedings of the relevant ETAPS conference, describing the main featu=
res
of the tool. There will be opportunities for follow-up demonstrations with
individuals and small groups.

Submissions should follow the instructions published in the URL of the
relevant conference. They should take the form of a self-contained tool
description of no more than 4 pages in the format specified by
Springer-Verlag at
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.
The tool description should be accompanied by an appendix (not intended for
publication, and not included in the page limit) indicating which features
of the tool would be demonstrated - preferably with some sample screen
snapshots - followed by a detailed specification of the hardware, software,
and licensing requirements for installing and using the tool.

N.B. Tool demonstrations should not be confused with research contributions
to the TACAS conference, which emphasizes principles of tool design,
implementation, and use, rather than focusing on specific domains
of application.

I am interested to find an article or book that is a category-
theoretic redevelopment of "classical" automata. I'd like to find
something that graduate students could use if they had already had an
automata course and now would retrace that same development using
category-theoretic vocabulary and means.

Thanks in advance...

Peter Johnstone has pointed out to me that there is, of course, a much
easier example of a category in which projections from products
needn't be epi: the good ol' category of sets.

As they say, the empty set really does exist.

It is interesting that construction of the coproduct in the category of
"just" rings (associative, unitary, but not necessary commutative) is
not easy to find in the literature.

It seems, however, that it is relatively easy to construct: for given
rings R1 and R2, let M1 and M2 be their multiplicative monoids and M be
coproduct of M1 and M2 in the category of monoids. Form monoid ring of M
over Z. That is, form free abelian group generated by underlying set of
M and extend multiplication from generators by distributivity. Let's
call resulting ring G. Let K be ideal in G generated by all elements of
the form

  (A + B) - A - B,

where both A and B belong to the same ring: either R1 or R2. That is, in
((A + B) - A - B) "+" is addition in R1 or R2, and "-" is subtraction in
G.

Now, quotient G/K is a coproduct of R1 and R2 in the category of rings, which
is easy to prove using universal properties of coproduct M, monoid ring G, and
epicness of the projection G ->> G/K.

Is there more "direct" description of coproduct in the category of rings?

Drafts of two new papers on Abstract Stone Duality are now available,
and I would very much appreciate your comments about them.

	Computably based locally compact spaces

	An elementary theory of the category of locally compact locales

	http://www.di.unito.it/~pt/ASD

These two papers bring ASD into line with the "official" theory of
locally compact sober spaces and locales, in two completely different
ways.  The ASD "Manifesto" was also revised recently.

	===================================

	Computably based locally compact spaces

The first paper shows that the main version of ASD is equivalent to
the category of "computably based" locally compact locales, and
computably continuous functions.

By a "basis" I mean a family of open subspaces U^n and accompanying
family of compact subspaces K^n, the topological information being
captured by the inclusion relation K^n subset U^m.  For locales the
corresponding idea is the "way below" relation.  The finitary
properties of this are characterised, including in particular the
"Wilker condition" concerning the inclusion of a compact subspace in
the union of two open ones. The motivation of the paper is principally
how to "import" traditional topology into ASD, using the real line as
a running example.

This paper is the expanded version of the one that I presented at
"Category Theory and Computer Science" in Ottawa and the "Domains
Workshop" in Birmingham last August/September.

	===================================

	An elementary theory of the category of locally compact locales

The second paper shows that, when we add an "underlying set" axiom,
the category becomes equivalent to the category of locally compact
locales over any elementary topos.   The usual structure of locale
theory (direct and inverse image maps, Heyting implication, etc)
is DERIVED, in a type-theoretic style.

This is a new characterisation, not only of this category of spaces,
but also of elementary toposes themselves.

(The same technique can be applied to the opposite of the category of
constructively completely distributive lattices, but I haven't filled
in the details of this yet.)

ASD axiomatises its category of spaces directly, not starting from a
category of sets. However, the full subcategory of overt discrete
spaces has emerged to fill this role.  In the traditional situation,
the forgetful functor from spaces to sets has both adjoints (the
discrete and indiscriminate topologies), but of these three functors,
only the leftmost exists in standard ASD.  This paper postulates its
right adjoint, which yields the couniversal overt discrete object
related to any given space.  (Such a thing would be unacceptable in
the main theory, as the equality predicate on the underlying set of
the powerset of N would solve the Halting Problem.)

Whereas the category of sets is an (often unstated) assumption in a
typical mathematical discourse, in this case the topos itself is
constructed from the axioms, viz as this full subcategory.

More significantly, the infinitary joins that are needed to axiomatise
either traditional topology or locale theory are also a consequence of
the axioms, and not a part of them. This is the sense in which the new
axiomatisation deserves to be called elementary.

In fact, the logical power of the theory (powersets in the topos, and
the infinitary joins) arises out of the ``underlying set'' assumption.
We have another example to show that closure of a full subcategory
under (co)limits is a long way from providing an adjoint, and indeed
the existence of the adjoint can be very strong foundational principle
in itself. For example, when well-foundedness is presented in
categorical terms using coalgebras, the extensional ones form a
reflective subcategory, but the axiom of replacement may be needed to
construct the reflection functor. See Exercise 9.62 in my book,
"Practical Foundations of Mathematics".

Hi Steve!

In my opinion, you're looking for stuff
on M-categories (M a Monoid)
and you're searching under keywords
like "action" --- initially left!

There is good material in Barr & Wells 1999.
(The 3rd edition)

or better groundwork ---
Lawvere and Rosebrugh 2003
[ though much of what you
eventually need is in the exercises :) ]

Dear Steve,

I'd be interested in such pointers as well, especially since "classical
automata theory" is a rather horrible mess.  You may want to check out

- Edwin Stewart Bainbridge's thesis "A unified minimal realization theory
  with duality", PhD Thesis, U. of Michigan, 1972.

- R. Betti, "Automi e categorie chiuse" Boll. Un. Mat. Ital. A (5)\(1980),
  44--58

- Kasangian, Kelly, and Rossi "Cofibrations and the realization of
  non-deterministic automata", Cahiers Topologie Geom. Diff. 24, 1 (1983),
  23--46.

Also, Mark William Hopkins presents some interesting ideas on his
WEB-page <http://www.uwm.edu/~whopkins/compalg/index.html>.  A pointer
to the coalgebraic view of automata is Jan Rutten's page
<http://homepages.cwi.nl/~janr/papers>.  You may want to start with
"Automata and coinduction (an exercise in coalgebra). Technical Report
SEN-R9803", which is available for downloading.

A textbook (unfortunately long out of print)
that seems quite suitable in both content and level
to your need is:

Ehrig, Kiermeier, Kreowski and K\:uhnel
Universal Theory of Automata
Teubner, 1974, 240pp.

Also, in response Juergen's remark that
"classical automata theory" is a rather horrible mess,
one most distinguished categorist evidently agreed with him
and responded by writing two ~400 page books on the subject:

Samuel Eilenberg
Automata, Languages and Machines
Academic Press, 1974 and 1976.

They make no explicit use of categorical notions nor language,
but considering the author and date the categorical spirit
surely prevails.
Note also his book with Elgot on Recursiveness.

Best, Keith

Hi Randy,

| Perhaps more usefully, how do you suggest I do this task of developing HOL
| without description operators.

You might find it interesting to look at HOL Light. This gives a
different axiomatization of the HOL logic, developed precisely because I
was dissatisfied with the one in the original HOL system, on which I
believe the Isabelle/HOL logic is based.

Although I do eventually introduce the description operator, quite a lot
of the basic logic --- including the automation of inductive definitions
--- is developed without it (and indeed without excluded middle or
extensionality). You may find it a more congenial starting-point.

As Konrad Slind later pointed out, what I settled on is remarkably close
to the internal logic of a topos, as presented for example in Lambek and
Scott's book. This was a surprise to me since at that time I knew next to
nothing about toposes and was motivated by a mixture of aesthetic and
software engineering considerations.

Cheers,

John.

Dear All,
I have a problem which I had thought very specialised, but actually can be
stated very generally: -

I have a category C with finite limits, and so I also have a category
DLat(C) of distributive lattices which, lets say, has coequalizers. If free
distibrutive lattices can be constructed (i.e. if there exists F:C->DLat(C)
left adjoint to the forgetful functor) then do free semilattices exist?

Thanks, Christopher Townsend (OU)

I suspect the answer is no, for irritatingly trivial reasons.
If C is a pointed category (i.e. has a zero object), then any internal
distributive lattice in C has its top and bottom elements equal, and
so is degenerate (i.e. isomorphic to the terminal object 1). Hence
the free-distributive-lattice functor exists, and is the constant
functor with value 1. But I'm sure there must be examples of pointed,
finitely complete categories which don't have a free-semilattice
functor (though I have to admit I don't have one at my fingertips).

Dear All,
Do injective objects exist in the category of the
coalgebras of the functor Po(Ax-) where P is the power
set functor and A a non empty set? If the answer is
yes, can they  be characterized?
Best regards.

PSSL 79 - DOORN, THE NETHERLANDS - FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT

Dear all,

This is the final announcement for the 79th meeting of the Peripatetic Seminar
on Sheaves and Logic, which will be held in the weekend of the 28th and 29th of
June in Doorn, a place near Utrecht, the Netherlands. It is organized by the
University of Utrecht with financial support from the MRI, the Mathematical
Research Institute.

We are glad to announce that this edition will feature a 3 hours tutorial by
Clemens Berger on the subject of theta-categories, a topic from
higher-dimensional category theory.

The other confirmed speakers so far, are:

Steve Awodey (Carnegie Mellon)
Erik Palmgren (Uppsala University)
Jonas Eliasson (Uppsala University)
Christopher Mulvey (University of Sussex)

The PSSL will take place at the conference centre "Kaap Doorn". The conference
centre also offers rooms and meals, but only people who react before Friday the
6th of June are guaranteed to be offered this opportunity.

FOR THIS REASON WE KINDLY URGE THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED TO REGISTER BEFORE THE
6TH OF JUNE.
(People who respond at a later date may have to stay at a hotel. In that case,
special arrangements have to be made.)

The all-in price for staying at the conference centre is 200-250 euro's.

For further information and the latest list of participants, please consult
the webpage (now fully operational):
http://www.math.uu.nl/people/vdberg/PSSL79

People who wish to attend the PSSL should send an e-mail to vdberg@math.uu.nl
indicating whether they you want to give a talk. Questions should be posted to
the same address.

With best regards,

The organizers,

Jaap van Oosten
Federico de Marchi
Pieter Hofstra

Hello,

    I am only familiar with semantic tableaux for
classical propositional logic (and classical 1st order
logic). It seems that as an inference system it is
based squarely around the law of the excluded middle
because it is essentially reductio ad absurdum. Hence,
as an inference system it can't be simply modified for
intuitionistic propositional calculus?? (Of course, I
am bringing this because the role that Heyting
algebras play in Topos theory).

Regards, Bill Halchin

I did not want to deny the need of mathematical thought, but I found
this example of topos theory emerging unexpectedly quite pleasing.

Note that the mail is *not* about Isabelle. Admittedly, I do not
know anything about the quoted system HOL light, so I have not
verified Slind's claim.

Isabelle's internal logic is not constructive. The existential clause of the
BHK-interpretation is violated so that a consquence of "all unicorns have
horns" is that "some unicorn has a horn". The moral (biased towards
theorists): software engineering considerations are not enough, a coherant
philosophy of mathematics is also needed.

Subject: categories: Function composition of natural transformations? (Pat Donaly)

Here is a technical/pedagogical question which has been bothering me for
about twelve years.

In problem 5 on page 19 of "Categories for the Working Mathematician" (CWM),
Saunders Mac Lane points out that a natural transformation may be fully
extended to an intertwining function from one category to another, intertwining
meaning (except in the void case), that the function transforms on one side
according to its domain functor and on the other according to its codomain functor.
Then on page 42 Mac Lane introduces what he calls "horizontal" composition
diagramatically and without reference to the fully extended intertwining
functions. But the function composite of such a pair of functions trivially
intertwines the function composite of the domain functors with that of the codomain
functors, and this function composition operation is very quickly verified to be
"horizontal" composition when written in terms of restrictions to sets of
objects. Thus Mac Lane and everyone else I have read leaves the impression that an
honest verification of, say, the associativity of "horizontal" composition
would require a somewhat involved diagrammatic demonstration which, in fact,
would be nothing other than the hard way to prove the associativity of function
composition. Presumably this has been noticed for a long, long time, but the
1998 edition of CWM did not mention it, and I can't help but be struck by the
fact that other authors' terminologies leave the impression that they don't know
or don't care that "horizontal", star or Godement composition is function
composition. Notationally, I am bemused to see the standard symbol for function
composition (the small circle) degraded into a generic symbol for the
composition of just about any category, while a star or an asterisk is frequently used
to denote what amounts to function composition done awkwardly.

This worries me that I am somehow overlooking something fairly blatant. Can
someone tell me what it is?
