This is a comment on one aspect of Jean Pradines' very interesting
posting of June 8. I quote a large part of it for reference:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

EXTRACT FROM JEAN'S POSTING:

Now what I really had in mind was not the purely algebraic (rather obviou=
s)
setting, but the study of quotients for the differentiable groupoids
(nowadays called smooth or Lie) introduced by Ehresmann in 1959, which ar=
e
groupoids in the category of manifolds.
The statement I had obtained (which again certainly cannot by any means b=
e
deduced from the general results of Ehresmann concerning topological or
structured groupoids) was published in 1966 in my Note (prealably submitt=
ed to Ehresmann and transmitted by him) :

-Th=E9orie de Lie pour les groupo=EFdes diff=E9rentiables. Relations entr=
e
propri=E9t=E9s locales et globales, CRAS (Paris), s=E9rie A, t.263, p.907=
-910, 19
d=E9cembre 1966-

in Th=E9or=E8me 5 (in this statement the Bourbaki term "subimmersion" is
improperly used and has to be understood in the more restricted acception
"submersion onto a submanifold" ; note also that the implication from 2=B0=
 to 1=B0 is valid only
when the fibres of the domain map of H are connected). (Note that in this=
 statement the algebraic theory of the two-sided quotient of a groupoid b=
y an invariant subgroupoid is implicitely considered as "well known" with=
out reference. This was in fact a diplomatic consequence of the above-men=
tionned conversation ! At least at that period it seems absolutely certai=
n that no reference did exist, and probably very few people, if any, had =
had the opportunity of thinking to that sort of questions, since the main=
 stream of categoricists were despising groupoids as beig trivial, since =
equvalent to groups).
The unpublished proof of this statement relied on a careful and rather
delicate study of the foliation defined by the two-sided cosets.
The very elegant proof for the case of Lie groups given in Serre, Lie
Algebras and Lie Groups (lecture in Harvard, 1964, p.LG 4.10-11), relying=
 on the so-called Godement's
theorem, works only for one-sided cosets and yields only the too special =
case
above-mentioned or more generally the statement of Proposition 2 in the
previous Note (which extends to groupoids the classical theory of homogen=
eous spaces for possibly non invariant subgroups).

It is clear that this last proof may be immediately written in a purely
diagrammatic way and remains valid in much more general contexts when an
abstract Godement's theorem is available. It turns out that this is the c=
ase
for most of (perhaps almost all)  the categories considered by "working
mathematicians", notably the abelian categories as well as toposes, the
category of topological spaces (with a huge lot of variants), the
category of Banach spaces, and many useful categories that are far from b=
eing complete.The precise definitions for what is meant by an abstract Go=
dement's theorem were given in my paper :

-Building Categories in which a Godement's theorem is available-
published in the acts of the Second Colloque sur l'Alg=E8bre des Cat=E9go=
ries,
Amiens 1975, Cahiers de Topologie....(CTGDC).

In this last paper I introduced the term "dyptique de Godement" for a
category in which one is given two subcategories of "good mono's" and "go=
od
epi's" (playing the roles of embeddings and surmersions in Dif) such that=
 a formal Godement's theorem is valid.

These considerations explain why I was strongly motivated for adapting
Serre's diagrammatic proof to the case of two-sided cosets (since such a =
proof would immediately extend the theory of quotients for groupoids in v=
arious non complete categories used by "working mathematicians", yielding=
 a lot of theorems completely out of the range of Ehresmann's general the=
ory of structured groupoids). However this was
achieved only in 1986 in my Note :

-Quotients de groupo=EFdes diff=E9rentiables, CRAS (Paris), t.303, S=E9ri=
e I, 1986, p.817-820.-

The proof requires the use of certain "good cartesian squares" or "good p=
ull back
squares", which, though they are not the most general pull back's existin=
g
in the category Dif of manifolds, cannot be obtained by the (too
restrictive) classical condition of transversality. Though written in the
framework of the category Dif (in order not to frighten geometers, but wi=
th
the risk of frightening categoricists), this paper is clearly thought in
order to be easily generalizable in any category where a suitable set of
distinguished pull back's is available , assuming only some mild stabilit=
y properties.

In this paper I introduced the seemingly natural term of "extensors" for
naming those functors between (structured) groupoids which arise from the
canonical projection of a groupoid onto its quotient by a normal
subgroupoid. Equivalent characterizations are given.(I am ignoring if ano=
ther term is being used in the literature).This notion is resumed and use=
d in my paper :

-Morphisms between spaces of leaves viewed as fractions-
CTGDC, vol.XXX-3 (1989),p. 229-246

which again is written in the smooth context, but using purely diagrammat=
ic descriptions (notably for Morita equivalences and generalized morphism=
s) allowing immediate extensions for various categories.
As a prolongation of this last paper, I intend in future papers to give a
description of the category of fractions obtained by inverting those
extensors with connected fibres. This gives a weakened form of Morita
equivalence which seems basic for understanding the transverse structure =
of
foliations with singularities.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

In response to Jean's paper

[QGD] Quotients de groupo=EFdes diff=E9rentiables, CRAS (Paris), t.303,=20
S=E9rie I, 1986, p.817-820.=20

Philip Higgins and I wrote two papers ([HM90a] and [HM90b] below)=20
dealing with general quotients of Lie (=3Ddifferentiable) groupoids=20
and Lie algebroids. Our starting point was the idea that:

``a morphism in a given category is entitled to be called a quotient=20
map if and only if it is entirely determined by data on the domain''

(Perhaps this will seem naive to true categorists, but I write as an=20
end user of category theory, not a developer.)=20

I would summarize [QGD] as proving that the `regular extensors' are
quotient maps in the category of Lie groupoids. [HM90b] then showed,
by extending the notion of kernel, that in fact all extensors are
quotient maps in the category of Lie groupoids.

Philip and I used the term `fibration' for what Jean calls an
`extensor'; these maps satisfy a natural smooth version of the=20
notion of `fibration of groupoids' introduced by Ronnie Brown=20
in 1970 (building on work of Frolich, I think). (Throughout this=20
post, I assume base maps to be surjective submersions.)

There is unlikely to be a more general class of quotient maps for
Lie groupoids: the fibration condition on a groupoid morphism=20
$F : G \to H$ is exactly what is needed to ensure that any product=20
in the codomain is determined by a product in the domain: given=20
elements $h, h'$ of $H$ which are composable, one wants to be able=20
to write $h =3D F(g)$ and $h' =3D F(g')$ in such as way that $gg'$ will=20
exist and determine $hh'$; the fibration condition is the weakest=20
simple condition which ensures this.=20

Fibrations of Lie groupoids are not determined by their kernel in=20
the usual sense (=3D union of the kernels of the maps of vertex=20
groups); one also requires the kernel pair of the base map, and the=20
action of this (considered as a Lie groupoid) on the manifold of=20
one--sided cosets of the domain. This data, which Philip and I=20
called a `kernel system' is equivalent to a suitably well--behaved
congruence on the domain groupoid. Though more complicated than the
usual notion of kernel, the notion of normal subgroupoid system=20
gives an exact extension of the `First Isomorphism Theorem'.=20

We also showed that regular fibrations (=3D Jean's regular extensors)
are precisely those in which the additional data can be deduced from
the standard kernel and the base map; in the regular case the two=20
step quotient can be reduced to a single quotient consisting of=20
double cosets (as Jean remarks in his post). The congruences=20
corresponding to regular fibrations are those which, regarded as=20
double groupoids, satisfy a double source condition.=20

A good example of a fibration which is not regular is the division=20
map $\delta: (g,h)\mapsto gh^{-1}$ in a group $G$, considered as a=20
groupoid morphism from the pair groupoid $G\times G$ to the group $G$.

All of this (for Lie algebroids, as well as for Lie groupoids and=20
for vector bundles) is in the two papers referenced below. There is=20
also a full account coming in my book `General Theory of Lie=20
groupoids and Lie algebroids' (CUP) which should be appearing=20
in the next few months.=20

I have the sensation that I'm about to ask a question to which half the
readers of this list will be able to see an answer immediately.
Unfortunately, I'm one of the other half.

What should it mean for a functor to "respect limits"?  Consider the
following informal definition: a functor respects limits if given any
diagram in the domain category, the limit of the image of the diagram is no
bigger than it needs to be.  Formally, let F: A ---> B be a functor, where
B is a category with (for sake of argument) all small limits and colimits.
Let I be a small category and D: I ---> A a diagram in A; write Cone(D) for
the category of cones on D in A, write Cone(FD) for the category of cones
on FD in B, and write

   F_*: Cone(D) ---> Cone(FD)

for the induced functor.  Then F can be said to "respect limits for D" if
the colimit of F_* is the terminal object of Cone(FD) (that is, the limit
cone on FD).

* Example: if D has a limit in A then the limit is a terminal object of
  Cone(D), so F respects limits for D if and only if it preserves the limit
  in the usual sense.

* Example: let B = Set and let A be the category consisting of a pair of
  parallel arrows; a functor F: A ---> B consists of sets and functions

      sigma, tau: F_0 ---> F_1.

  The condition that F respects pullbacks says that sigma and tau are monic
  and that the images of sigma and tau are disjoint.

The thought behind "no bigger than it needs to be" (a very approximate
description, I know) is that if we have a cone on D with vertex v then
there's an induced map from F(v) to lim(FD), which in some sense places a
"lower bound" on lim(FD): e.g. if B = Set and F(v) is nonempty then lim(FD)
is nonempty.  For F to respect limits for D means that lim(FD) is built up
freely from these F(v)s.

So the question is: is this notion of "respecting limits" well-known or
well-understood?  Is there, for instance, some way of rephrasing it that
brings it into more familiar territory?

Thanks very much,
Tom

This is is the announced secund part added to my response to Kirill's
comments concerning terminology.

The first part deals with the relation between my "regular extensors" and
Kirill's "regular fibrations", and points a misunderstanding.

This secund part cannot be read independently of the first one and will
concern Kirill's use of the term "quotient of groupoids".

>From his message quoted below, I now extract the following :

<<``a morphism in a given category is entitled to be called a quotient
map if and only if it is entirely determined by data on the domain''>>

Perhaps this will seem naive to true categorists, but I write as an
end user of category theory, not a developer.) >>

<<There is unlikely to be a more general class of quotient maps for
Lie groupoids: the fibration condition on a groupoid morphism
$F : G \to H$ is exactly what is needed to ensure that any product
in the codomain is determined by a product in the domain: given
elements $h, h'$ of $H$ which are composable, one wants to be able
to write $h =3D F(g)$ and $h' =3D F(g')$ in such as way that $gg'$ will
exist and determine $hh'$; the fibration condition is the weakest
simple condition which ensures this. >>

First I observe that the expression "entirely determined by data on the
domain'' can hardly be given a precise mathematical or logical status, sinc=
e
it seems difficult to justify in a formalisable way why the (tautological)
data of the given
functor f (from H to G) itself could not be considered as data "on H", whil=
e
the extra data of an equivalence relation, a subgroupoid, or a "kernel
system",
would be such.
On the other hand a morphism such as,for instance, the diagonal map H --> H
x H is
certainly entirely determined by the single data H without any extra data !=
!

Precise definitions of the various possible notions of quotient categories
and a thorough discussion can be found in Ehresmann's book, at least in
theory.
The case of groupoids is treated as a special case, but, as pointed in my
first message to Marco, Ehresmann always missed the very simple and
important (though or because) special case of what I call extensors ( =3D
regular fibrations).
This study is made for categories and also for a weaker notion called
"multiplicative
graphs" (in which the associativity is dropped and the composite of two
adjacent arrows may be undefined). The stubborn Ehresmann's reader might
perhaps guess that this notion was probably introduced precisely in order t=
o
handle the composition laws one gets when studying equivalence relations on
a category which are compatible in a natural sense with the algebraic data.
When such a quotient law defines a true category law (which is not
automatic), this one is called a "strict quotient". There exist quotients
which are not strict, but satisfy
the natural universal property of quotients.The condition of what I call
"exactors"
(=3D fibrations) is given as sufficient for a quotient being strict.

However it is very difficult to extract these (interesting and important)
facts from the book because of the very clumsy notations, terminology and
redaction, and the (intentional !) absence of examples.
So, instead of asking the reader to try to read Ehresmann's book,  it will
be enough for a clear understanding to give some very simple examples of
what may happen, being content with the case of groupoids, in order to
illustrate Ehresmann's definitions and their motivations (I confess that I
have no idea of the examples Ehresmann had in mind, and I don't claim I
understood everything ! ).
First we give an alternative definition for strict quotients as resulting
from criteria proved in Ehresmann's book :
a quotient is strict when the map Vf : VH --> VG (where the functorial
symbol V is used
here, unusually, for denoting composable pairs or pairs with the same domai=
n
or the same codomain) is surjective (this allows an immediate transfer to
the smooth case via the diptych policy).

In the following examples, we'll denote by I (resp.  D (written for Delta,
pictured by a triangle)) the banal (=3D coarse) groupoid with just two (res=
p.
three) objects.

FIRST EXAMPLE :
Let H be the groupoid III (sum of three copies of I), G =3D D, and f be the
map sending the three copies of I respectively onto the three edges of the
triangleD. (Note that all these groupoids may be considered as topological
or even smooth withe the discrete topology, and hence f as continuous or
smooth).Then :

-1) f defines a surjective functor ; let R be the equivalence relation on H
thus defined.
-2) f is faithful, but not full, and not an exactor.
-3) R is "bicompatible" in Ehresmann's sense, wich means compatible with th=
e
composition law of H as well as with the source and range (otherwise domain
and codomain) maps.
-4) The quotient law thus defined on G is only a part of the groupoid law
(it
defines a "multiplicative graph" in the sense of Ehresmann).
So H is not a "strict quotient" in Ehresmann's sense.
-5) However this groupoid law is "entirely determined" by the quotient law
(hence by H and R) in that sense that it is the unique groupoid law
extending that quotient law and defining a quotient in the universal sense
(more precise statements can be found in Ehresmann's book).
So f should be called a quotient map by Kirill according to the first
quotation (one does not see why the data of the equivalence relation R,whic=
h
determines eveything, could not be considered as data "on H"). But this
contradicts the secund one.
-6)  (f,G) is a quotient groupoid of H in the very general and widely
admitted (not
only by Ehresmann, but by Bourbaki and nearly everybody) sense of quotient
structures, which means here that it satisfies the following universal
property of quotients :
given any groupoid Z and any functor h from H to Z admitting a set
theoretical factorization h =3D gf, then g defines a functor from G to Z.
[Exercise : show that f is composed of an (injective) groupoid equivalence,
and a surjective actor. Hint : embed suitably H =3D III into K =3D DDD (sum=
 of
three
copies of D), and note that K may be viewed as an action groupoid.]

SECUND EXAMPLE :
We now define H by suppressing a copy of I in the previous example and
restricting f.
Nothing is changed in the conclusions save the surjectivity of f, so that
now G is no more set-theoretic quotient, but is still a quotient in the
categorical sense.

THIRD EXAMPLE :
We start again with III, but define H by now adding a copy of D and
extending f obviously (i.e. by the identity).
Then what is changed in the conclusions is that now the groupoid law of G
may be fully defined as the quotient law (since composable arrows of G are
now always images of some composable arrows of H), so that (f,G) is a
"strict
quotient" of H in the sense of Ehresmann, though f is not an exactor. Once
again
it should be a quotient in the sense of Kirill according to the first
(informal) "definition", though it still contradicts the secund one.

So we see that we have a chain of strict implications :
quotient (in the universal sense) <=3D=3D surjective quotient <=3D=3D stric=
t
quotient <=3D=3D surjective exactors (alias fibrations) <=3D=3D extensors (=
alias
regular fibrations).
I think there is absolutely no reason to keep the word "quotient map", for
the fourth term of this chain, which is just a criterion for quotients amon=
g
others. Moreover among the exactors (star surjectivity condition alone),
surjective exactors (where the surjectivity is a consequence of the
surjectivity for the bases) are just a special case : the importance of
exactors comes mainly, I think, from the fact that any functor f is
isomorphic with an exactor (which is surjective iff  f is essentially
surmersive) (see Prop. 8.1, 8.2 and 10.4 of [MVF]) and all of this extends
to the smooth , via the general "diptych" policy.

posting of June 8.

In response to Jean's paper

[QGD] Quotients de groupo=EFdes diff=E9rentiables, CRAS (Paris), t.303,
S=E9rie I, 1986, p.817-820.

Philip Higgins and I wrote two papers ([HM90a] and [HM90b] below)
dealing with general quotients of Lie (=3Ddifferentiable) groupoids
and Lie algebroids. Our starting point was the idea that:

``a morphism in a given category is entitled to be called a quotient
map if and only if it is entirely determined by data on the domain''

(Perhaps this will seem naive to true categorists, but I write as an
end user of category theory, not a developer.)

I would summarize [QGD] as proving that the `regular extensors' are
quotient maps in the category of Lie groupoids. [HM90b] then showed,
by extending the notion of kernel, that in fact all extensors are
quotient maps in the category of Lie groupoids.

Philip and I used the term `fibration' for what Jean calls an
`extensor'; these maps satisfy a natural smooth version of the
notion of `fibration of groupoids' introduced by Ronnie Brown
in 1970 (building on work of Frolich, I think). (Throughout this
post, I assume base maps to be surjective submersions.)

There is unlikely to be a more general class of quotient maps for
Lie groupoids: the fibration condition on a groupoid morphism
$F : G \to H$ is exactly what is needed to ensure that any product
in the codomain is determined by a product in the domain: given
elements $h, h'$ of $H$ which are composable, one wants to be able
to write $h =3D F(g)$ and $h' =3D F(g')$ in such as way that $gg'$ will
exist and determine $hh'$; the fibration condition is the weakest
simple condition which ensures this.

Fibrations of Lie groupoids are not determined by their kernel in
the usual sense (=3D union of the kernels of the maps of vertex
groups); one also requires the kernel pair of the base map, and the
action of this (considered as a Lie groupoid) on the manifold of
one--sided cosets of the domain. This data, which Philip and I
called a `kernel system' is equivalent to a suitably well--behaved
congruence on the domain groupoid. Though more complicated than the
usual notion of kernel, the notion of normal subgroupoid system
gives an exact extension of the `First Isomorphism Theorem'.

We also showed that regular fibrations (=3D Jean's regular extensors)
are precisely those in which the additional data can be deduced from
the standard kernel and the base map; in the regular case the two
step quotient can be reduced to a single quotient consisting of
double cosets (as Jean remarks in his post). The congruences
corresponding to regular fibrations are those which, regarded as
double groupoids, satisfy a double source condition.

A good example of a fibration which is not regular is the division
map $\delta: (g,h)\mapsto gh^{-1}$ in a group $G$, considered as a
groupoid morphism from the pair groupoid $G\times G$ to the group $G$.

All of this (for Lie algebroids, as well as for Lie groupoids and
for vector bundles) is in the two papers referenced below. There is
also a full account coming in my book `General Theory of Lie
groupoids and Lie algebroids' (CUP) which should be appearing

This is a purely terminological remark concerning the comments sent by =
Kirill Mackenzie about the response I made to Marco Mackaay's message =
("reference normal categorical subgroup ?", June 5). From these =
comments,  fully quoted below (though omitting the partial quotations =
from my own message of June 8), I extract the following two fragments :

<<Philip and I used the term `fibration' for what Jean calls =
an`extensor'>>

<<regular fibrations (=3D Jean's regular extensors) are precisely those =
in which the additional data can be deduced from the standard kernel and =
the base map>>

Indeed Kirill makes a double confusion (probably caused by the =
ellipticity of the redaction of my Note referenced below as [QGD]) about =
the meanings I attribute to the terms "extensor" and "regular".

As to the latter term, it has for me a purely smoothness meaning =
(referring to the fact that the equivalences on the manifolds have to be =
regular ones, and also that the anchor map of the kernel has to be a =
regular morphism, by which I mean composed of a surmersion and an =
embedding) and this term has to be dropped when dealing with the purely =
algebraic aspect of the question. In my paper referenced [MVF] I use =
instead (in view of more generality) the term "s-extensor", where the =
prefix  "s-" refers to the more general context of "diptych" data (in =
which goodepics/good monos generalize and replace surmersions/embeddings =
; see my previous message), and, in the algebraic context, has to be =
read as just meaning "surjective" ( but is then considered as implied by =
the very term "extensor").

On the opposite the term "extensor" has for me a purely algebraic =
meaning (more restrictive than what is called "fibration" in Kirill's =
message) and is equivalent to the notion of what is called "regular =
fibration" in Kirill's message (where here "regular" is given an =
algebraic meaning which I never used for myself !), and refers to the =
very simple case, alluded to in my own previous message, where one can =
mimic exactly the theory of group extensions or surjective group =
homomorphisms (with the only caution of using two-sided cosets). The =
suffix "or" is to remind that this a funct-or instead of a funct-ion. =
(In the absence at the present day of any response from Marco, I guess, =
without being sure, that he was probably interested mainly in this case, =
or perhaps in the still more special case when the kernel reduces to a =
sum of groups ). It should be noticed that the (rather obvious) examples =
given at the end of my Note emphasize the independance of the algebraic =
conditions (extensor) and the smoothness ones (regular), so that the =
ambiguity, if it existed, should be cleared up for the careful reader =
(in the last of these examples the underlying algebraic functor is just =
the identity, but not the identity for the underlying smooth =
structures).

The so-called "fibrations" were out of the scope of [QFD], which was =
centred on the smoothness questions and not on the (obvious in that =
special case) algebraic aspect, implicitely (and perhaps imprudently !) =
considered there as "well known".

However they are considered, and play a basic role, in [MVF] (p. 238 =A7 =
7) under the name of "(surjective) exactors" (explained below), but the =
general problem of quotients and generalized kernels in the sense =
described and referenced by Kirill (which is of course much more =
delicate than the algebraically obvious case of extensors) is completely =
out of the scope of this paper. The remark (ii) of this page 238 =
emphasizes the fact that "extensor" implies "surjective exactor".
=20
 Now it should be clear that when dealing with topological or smooth =
(i.e. Lie) groupoids, terms such as "(regular) fibrations" have to be =
definitely rejected, though previously used by various authors in the =
purely algebraic (or categorical) context, as giving rise to unsolvable =
ambiguities. (Note that there is a similar problem when using the =
widespread terminology "discrete" and "coarse" for groupoids ; though =
the ambiguity is  generally much less disastrous in that case, I think =
it much better to use respectively the terms "null" and "banal"). The =
reason is of course that these terms have very ancient (various !) =
meanings in Topology and Differential Geometry, which are not at all =
implied by (nor imply) the algebraic condition, nor by weaker =
topological or smoothness conditions such as (surjective) open maps or =
surmersions.
=20
I remind that unhappily the term "foncteur fibrant" was introduced very =
early by Grothendieck and his school, and is, I think, still used by =
most category theorists, concurrently with the term "fibration", which =
appeared, I think, a little later. Ronnie Brown used also sometimes the =
more suggestive and non ambiguous term "star-surjective", which might =
become "star-surmersive" in the smooth case (and perhaps something like =
"star-epic" in my more genaral dyptich framework, though I don't intend =
to use it).

The terminology proposed in [MVF] (to which I refer for more precision =
and details omitted here) comes from a general analysis of the =
properties of a functor f  between two groupoids, going from H to G =
(here we shall always assume below, to simplify, that f induces a =
surjective map for the bases, thus omitting as a consequence the word =
"surjective" in many occurences in what follows ; see [MVF] for more =
general and precise definitions and statements).  Forgetting for a while =
(to make the things simpler) the smoothness (or diptych) framework to =
consider solely the algebraic properties, I believe that the most =
important of these are reflected by the two commutative squares a(f) and =
t(f) built, from f, respectively with the domain maps and the anchor =
maps (of H and G), and more precisely by the properties of =
injectivity/surjectivity/bijectivity of the two canonical arrows =
(denoted below by u and w) going from H to the pull back's generated by =
these two squares. (My general guess and philosophy is then that the =
suitable corresponding notions in the smooth or more generally "diptych" =
case -see my previous message- are gotten by just replacing =
"injective/surjective/bijective" by "good mono/good epi/iso", and that =
as soon as one is able to describe the set theoretic algebraic =
definitions, constructions and proofs by means of diagrams, everything =
extends "almost automatically" to the structured case, using the =
Godement diptych axioms).=20

In that context the extensors are just defined very quickly by the =
surjectivity of w and the "exactors" (here always surjective)by the =
surjectivity of u ("star-surjectivity" in the sense of Ronnie). (Note =
that the bijectivity of w characterizes the surjective equivalences, =
which are special instances of extensors).

Now it turns out readily that the bijectivity of u characterize those =
functors which describe actions of the groupoid G on the base of H (H is =
then called the action groupoid in the literature, but I emphasize the =
fact that the action of G is not fully described by H alone, but by the =
functor f). For that reason I believe quite natural (though I don't seem =
to be followed) to call "(surjective) actors" the functors of this type =
(note that the classical terminology in categorical works is "discrete =
fibrations" (!),  "foncteurs d'hypermorphismes" (!!) in Ehresmann's =
book, and sometimes "star-bijective" for Ronnie Brown).=20
This explains (but perhaps does not justify) the above-mentioned term =
"exactor", with the suffix "or" as supra, and the prefix "ex" supposed =
to remind the surjectivity property of u (and not some terrorist or =
prejudicial activity) while evocating also some generalized kind of =
ex-tension.=20

The (surjective) actors and extensors appear as two opposite ways of =
degenerating for the (surjective) exactors, while the theory of  Kirill =
and Philip explains how these two special cases are mixed up in the =
general (more sophisticated) case.
There is also a very interesting special case of exactors described in =
[MVF] under the name of "subactors" (Prop.-Def. 7.5), which are the =
faithful ones. They make up a subcategory whose arrows admit a unique =
factorization through a surjective equivalence and an actor. (As a =
general remark all the purely algebraic underlying content of [MVF] may =
be considered as more or less easy or even trivial and or more (or less =
?) well known, but again the interesting point is that the rather easy =
set-theoretical proofs may be (with some care) written diagrammatically =
in order to be transferred to the smooth case via the diptych method).

In a secund part, I'll add some other terminological remarks about the =
terminology of "quotient groupoids" used by Kirill.

                                                                         =

CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT
10th International Conference on
Algebraic Methodology And Software Technology
AMAST 2004
http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/events/amast2004/

---------------------------------------------
July 12th - 16th, 2004
Stirling, Scotland, UK.

The major goal of the AMAST Conferences is to promote research that may
lead to the setting of software technology on a firm, mathematical basis.
This goal is achieved by a large international cooperation with
contributions from both academia and industry. The virtues of a software
technology developed on a mathematical basis have been envisioned as being
capable of providing software that is (a) correct, and the correctness can
be proved mathematically, (b) safe, so that it can be used in the
implementation of critical systems, (c) portable, i.e., independent of
computing platforms and language generations, and (d) evolutionary, i.e.,
it is self-adaptable and evolves with the problem domain. All previous
editions of the AMAST Conference, which were held at Iowa City (1989,1991),
Twente (1993), Montreal (1995), Munich (1996), Sydney (1997), Manaus
(1999), Iowa City (2000), and Reunion Island (2002), made contributions to
the AMAST goals by reporting and disseminating academic and industrial
achievements within the AMAST area of interest. During these meetings,
AMAST attracted an international following among researchers and
practitioners interested in software technology, programming methodology
and their algebraic and logical foundations. In addition, starting with the
1993 edition, the first day of each conference was dedicated to Mathematics
Education for Software Engineers.


TOPICS
------
As in previous years, we will invite papers reporting original research on
setting software technology on a firm mathematical basis. We expect two
kinds of submissions for this conference: technical papers and system
demonstrations. Of particular interest is research on using algebraic,
logic, and other formalisms suitable as foundations for software
technology, as well as software technologies developed by means of logic
and algebraic methodologies. Topics of interest include, but are not

Hi all,

Does anybody know of an example of a Right Kan Extension of a functor
X:A->C along a functor F:A->B where B is not the 1 object category (as
this gives limits)? I'm looking for an intuitive example for a computer
scientist, not a mathematician (i.e. me!).

In "Categories and Computer Science" [Walters,1991], example 6 in
chapter 7 explains a situation in which the Left Kan Extension gives us
the arrows of the category B. As far as I can work out, the Right Kan
Extension for this set-up of A,B,C and functors X and F yields a trivial
answer. I am hoping to learn of a useful example to work with.

Regards,
Shane O'Conchuir

Here are some historical notes, in complement to Pradines' comments on=20
multiplicative graphs and on quotient categories.

Charles Ehresmann introduced multiplicative graphs as an algebraic support=
=20
to the notion of a "category kernel", which corresponds to the structure=20
induced on an open subset of a topological category (in the sense of=20
Charles, i.e. a category internal to Top). Such category kernels generalize=
=20
group kernels (that Charles used in the second part of his thesis to define=
=20
locally homogeneous spaces); we had considered  them in the early sixties=20
both in his papers on differential geometry and in mine on optimization=20
problems. Then multiplicative graphs appeared as a natural tool in his=20
study on quotient categories.

Charles came to quotient categories by his works on foliations and on=20
prolongations of manifolds. In his long 1962 paper on foliations (1), he=20
constructs several kinds of holonomy groupoids by a quotient process. In=20
his paper on topological categories (2), he construct categories of jets=20
(local jets and infinitesimal jets) as quotient categories of the category=
=20
of local sections of a topological category. In fact he had exposed these=20
constructions much earlier in his lectures and briefly alluded to in his=20
papers on differential geometry in the late fifties.

So he was naturally led to a more formal study of quotients, which he began=
=20
in his paper "Structures quotient" (3), where in particular he introduces=20
the "strict quotient"; this paper (abstracted in (4)) is more easily read=20
than later papers. In a comment I have added to this paper in the "Oeuvres"=
=20
(comment 170, p. 375) I mentioned other authors who have studied quotient=20
categories about the same time, in particular Dedeckerand Mersch, Higgins,=
=20
Hoenke, P=FCmplun.

Later on, Charles tried to develop a non-abelian cohomology for which he=20
wanted to define a natural notion of "short sequence" in Cat. For this he=20
needed to define quotients of a category or of a groupoid by a=20
sub-category. It is done in the paper (5). The main results of this paper=20
are taken back in his book "Categories et Structures" (Dunod 1965), with=20
some illustrative diagrams (it is to this book that Pradines refers).
In several papers, he generalized the theory of quotient categories in the=
=20
frame of internal categories (cf. "Oeuvres", Parts III and IV), .

Dear categorist:
It seems that a number of categorists recently received a message showing as
sender tholen@mathstat.yorku.ca, as subject "Re: application", with an
attachment that, of course, one should not open. Let me clarify that I never
sent such a message. I have been told that in all likelihood my address was
used to disguise the virus-affected machine that sent the message and that was
the real target of the attack.

Jean Pradines has kindly corrected my usage of "intertwining function". I
erred in attempting to extend this term to the variant naturality concept
described but not named by Mac Lane in problem 5, page 19 of either edition of
"Categories for the Working Mathematician". To within order of the functors which
are involved, this problem describes a natural transformation from functor F:A-->
B to parallel functor G:A-->B to be a function t which satisfies the left and
right transformation laws

t(ab)=G(a)t(b)=t(a)F(b)

when ab is defined in A. (The pair (G,F) is implicitly part of the natural
transformation.)  If A is a group with object u and G and F are group actions,
then the value t(u) is a classical intertwining function, whereas I have been
calling t an intertwining function. I apologize to all of those who had any of
their time wasted in wondering about this connection.

I still need terminology for t much more than I need the intertwining
function idea; so, from now on, I intend to use "entwining function" to refer to t,
but, if this conflicts with more standard usage or if there is already a
standard word for t, I would appreciate being told.

Categorists:

Here is something which bothers me.

It seems to be common for textbook writers to prove that the composite of a
pair of monomorphisms is a monomorphism, and it may be taken for granted that
everyone knows that every object is a monomorphism. These two facts imply that
the monomorphisms in a category form a subcategory of it. A similar remark
applies to pullbacks: On page 16 of "Sheaves in Geometry and Logic", Mac Lane and
Moerdijk prove among other things that, in the category of commutative
squares of a category, the composite of a pair of pullbacks is a pullback, which is
a good start toward establishing that the pullbacks form a subcategory of the
commutative squares, but Mac Lane and Moerdijk are satisfied with calling the
multiplicativity of pullbacks a "pasting lemma" (the quotes are theirs). In
proposition 18.16. on page 121 of their 1973 book, "Category Theory", Herrlich
and Strecker do this sort of thing wholesale, leaving me to wonder, is there
something wrong with the subcategory concept?

To be honest, I have noticed that the habit of naming categories after
their objects to the extent possible makes it difficult to speak of a
subcategory which has the same objects as its parent, but it nevertheless
seems strange that, after generalizing the subobject notion, category
theory would terminologically orphan its own subobjects. Any
clarifications or corrections of these impressions?

A week ago I asked this list a question, thinking that lots of people
would know the answer.  Either I was wrong or those who know are keeping
it to themselves, as I didn't get any answers at all.  But I now
understand the issue better than before, so I'd like to try re-asking my
question in a different way and see if that elicits a response.

I'm trying to understand a certain notion of compatibility of a functor
with limits.  There are of course several well-known such notions:
preserves, reflects, creates.  I called mine (provisionally) "respecting"
limits.  It is close to preservation, but not quite the same; it seems
more constructive and perhaps (dare I say it?) more natural.
Preservation is all very well when the domain category has all limits, or
all limits of whatever type we're concerned with.  But otherwise, it seems
a bit suspect.  For let F: A ---> B be a functor; preservation says that
given a diagram D: I ---> A in A,

- if D *does* admit a limit cone, then the image of that cone under F is
  also a limit cone,

- if D *doesn't* admit a limit cone, then... well, nothing.

"Respect", on the other hand, says the same as preservation in the first
case, but also says something in the second case.  (So respect is in
general stronger than preservation.)

Last time I gave a definition of respect in terms of categories of cones;
that definition is appended to this mail.  Here's a different way to put
it: F "respects limits for D" if the canonical map

  \int^a  (\int_i A(a, Di)) \times Fa   ---->  \int_i FDi

is an isomorphism.  Here \int^a denotes coend over a in A, \int_i is limit
over i in I, and I'm working under the assumption that these (co)limits
exist in the codomain category B.  Now, if D does have a limit in A then
the left-hand side is

  \int^a  A(a, \int_i Di) \times Fa

which by density is just F \int_i Di; so, as claimed, respect is the same
as preservation in the case where the limit exists.

My question was whether anyone understood "respect of limits" well, or
could shed any light on it.  It seems to me that, as well as being just
the right thing in certain examples I've been considering, it's a very
natural concept.

Tom

Let C and D be any two categories (probably small). Consider the category
that have all
functors from C to D as objects and natural transformations as morphisms.
Does this category have initial (or terminal) objects and binary products?

Dear Categorists -

Who first showed that an internal category in
the category of abelian groups was a 2-term chain
complex of abelian groups?  What's a good reference?

Who first showed that an internal strict omega-category
in the category of abelian groups was a chain complex
of abelian groups?  What's a good reference?

(Of course for "internal X in the category of Y's",
I am willing to accept "internal Y in the category of X's"
as a substitute.)

Best,
jb

To all category theorists:

While (partially) responding to Tom Leinster's 7/04 query regarding limit
preservation, a query of my own occurred to me: On pages 6 and 7 of Alain Connes'
book, "Noncommutative Geometry", he writes, "It is fashionable among
mathematicians to despise groupoids and to consider that only groups have an authentic
mathematical status, probably because of the pejorative suffix oid."
Professor Connes later cites the groupoid of states of the hydrogen atom in order to
eliminate the prejudice against groupoids, but, for group theorists, there is a
more direct way: Since Frobenius and/or Burnside adopted the concept of an
abstract group in order to consider general group actions and representations,
group theorists have been heavily involved in groupoids, whether they liked it
or not.

Is it generally understood by categorists that every group action---as a
comma category---is a groupoid?

Here's a new paper that studies categorified groups and
Lie groups:

Higher-Dimensional Algebra V: 2-Groups
John C. Baez and Aaron D. Lauda

Abstract:

A 2-group is a "categorified" version of a group, in which the
underlying set G has been replaced by a category and the
multiplication map m: G x G -> G has been replaced by a functor.
Various versions of this notion have already been explored;
our goal here is to provide a detailed introduction to two,
which we call "weak" and "coherent" 2-groups.  A weak 2-group
is a weak monoidal category in which every morphism has an
inverse and every object x has a "weak inverse": an object
y such that x tensor y and y tensor x are isomorphic to 1.
A coherent 2-group is a weak 2-group in which every object x
is equipped with a specified weak inverse x* and isomorphisms
i_x: 1 -> x tensor x*, e_x: x* tensor x -> 1 forming an
adjunction.  We define 2-categories of weak and coherent
2-groups, construct an "improvement" 2-functor which turns
weak 2-groups into coherent ones, and prove this 2-functor
is a 2-equivalence of 2-categories.  We also internalize
the concept of coherent 2-group, which gives a way to define
topological 2-groups, Lie 2-groups, affine 2-group schemes,
and the like.  We conclude with a tour of examples.
Diagrammatic methods are emphasized throughout - especially
string diagrams.

This paper will soon appear on the mathematics arXiv, but
their computer seems unable to draw some of the pictures
correctly, so I urge you to try this PDF version instead:

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/hda5.pdf

The next paper in this series will study categorified Lie algebras.

It just occurred to me that there is something closely related
in lattice theory; unfortunately I cannot give a reference, but
I remember that one calls a subposet P' of a poset P
relatively (co)complete if whenever a subset of P' has an upper
bound in P, it has a least upper bound in P'.

A related question: does anybody know any analogs of the
Freyd's Adjoint Functor Theorems for functors between
in(co)complete categories?

It is pretty well-known that Grothendieck abelian categories have all
small limits.  It is perhaps less well known that these inverse limits
do not have to have the same exactness properties as the usual module
inverse limits.  For example, the infinite product is left exact, but
not exact, in a general Grothendieck category.  Since Grothendieck
categories have enough injectives, one can take the right derived
functors of product and the right derived functors of inverse limit.
Since products are not exact, the inverse limit of a sequence could well
have infinitely many nonzero right derived functors, even if it satisfies
a Mittag-Leffler condition.

Does anyone know if right derived functors of products and inverse limits have
even been studied, either in general Grothendieck categories or in
specific examples?

In answer to Pat Donaly

The connection between group actions and groupoids has been known and=20
extensively used for a long time. It was realized by Charles Ehresmann in=20
the early fifties. In fact Charles came to categories from groupoids, and=20
to groupoids from group actions and from pseudogroups of transformations.

In particular, in his works on fibre bundles and Differential Geometry, he=
=20
associated a groupoid to a pseudogroup of transformations (1), then=20
considered action of groupoids of jets as extending group actions (2).

In the paper (3) he introduces topological and differentiable categories=20
(i.e., internal to Top and to Diff), in view of associating to a principal=
=20
bundle H a particular topological groupoid P (called a locally trivial=20
groupoid). He then finds the locally trivial bundles associated to H as the=
=20
spaces on which there is an (internal) action of this groupoid. Given a=20
topological space F with an action of a sub-group of P, he constructs such=
=20
a space with fibre F by an "enlargement"  process he had defined in his=20
important paper (4).

These results and many others can be found in the series of papers=20

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 12th International FME Symposium

Pisa, Italy - September 8-14, 2003

http://fme03.isti.cnr.it -  fme03@isti.cnr.it

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FM 2003 is the twelfth in a series of symposia organized by Formal
Methods Europe, an independent association whose aim is to stimulate
the use of, and research on, formal methods for software development.
These symposia have been notably successful in bringing together a
community of users, researchers, and developers of precise
mathematical methods for software development as well as industrial
users.

Formal methods have been controversial throughout their history, and
the realization of their full potential remains, in the eyes of many
practitioners, merely a promise. Have they been successful in
industry? If so, under which conditions? Has any progress been made
in dispelling the skepticism that surrounds them? Are they worth the
effort? Which aspects of formal methods have become so well
established in the industrial practices to loose the "formal method"
label in the meanwhile?

FM 2003 aims to answer these questions, by contributions not only
from the Formal Methods community but also from outsiders and even
from skeptical people who are most welcome to explain, document, and
motivate the source of their reluctance.

Satellite Events

FM 2003, will host 7 Workshops, 8 Tutorials and 1 Day dedicated to
the Industry besides the 3 days of the FME Symposium. Tool
demonstrations will also take place during the symposium, with the
opportunity of holding presentations for each tool.

For full details on the Symposium organization and to register please
see the web site http://fme03.isti.cnr.it, or send  your query to
fme03@isti.cnr.it.

To all category theorists:

Some time ago I noticed a generalization of the Yoneda Lemma which runs as
follows: As in the classical version, one begins with a nonvoid category A and a
pair of function-valued bifunctors on the product of the following
categories: The first is the category of function-valued natural transformations on A,
and the second is A itself.  One of the bifunctors is the evaluation functor
(t,a)-->t(a), where t is a function-valued natural transformation on A, and a is
an A-morphism. Call this bifunctor E. The other bifunctor Y is described as
an iterated Yoneda embedding which has been unpartialled, and the classical
Yoneda Lemma states that Y is naturally isomorphic to E.  Also, a particular
isomorphism is specified, at least on objects.  But the situation is clarified by
observing that there is a bijective parameterization of the homset H of
natural transformations which entwine Y with E by what has to be called the center
of A, that is, by the commutative monoid C of natural transformations (under
(indifferently) pointwise or function composition) which entwine the identity
functor on A with itself.  This parameterization sends natural isomorphisms to
natural isomorphisms, and, applying it to the identity functor on A gives the
classical Yoneda Lemma, but, of course, there might be other isomorphisms in C,
hence other isomorphisms of Y with E.

The parameterization formula from the center C into the homset H is not
particularly enlightening, but its inverse is literally the formula which expresses
an adjunctional unit in terms of its adjunction (regarded as a
function-valued natural bitransformation). In fact, this development all comes out of the
observation that the adjunctional unit formula extends to a concept which is
well beyond the idea of an adjunction, and this generalized unit concept even
includes naturality in a certain sense. Thus one nearly has naturality, the
Yoneda Lemma, the adjunctional unit concept and the idea of the center of a
category all together in one basket.

It is my personal opinion that these facts are most easily seen by working
with natural transformations in terms of their fully extended entwining
functions (so that "horizontal" composition is function composition and "vertical"
composition is pointwise composition), but ruthless experience tells me that
someone who is not familiar with the journal literature should take care not to
underestimate a priori the mysterious capabilities of diagrammers, who, after
all, created category theory in the first place.  Moreover, I have no way to
assess the value of this generalization in terms of the classical applications of
the Yoneda Lemma, as in, say, the calculation of characteristic classes. Thus
I am interested in getting directions to relevant portions of the literature,
and would someone point out any applications of this generalized Yoneda
Lemma?

This is quite similar, but not the same.  I'll take the dual concept (glbs
rather than lubs), since it was respect of limits that I wrote about
originally.  Take an inclusion P' into P of posets, and take a diagram D
in P', which might as well be just a subset of P'.  Then to say that the
inclusion of P' into P respects meets for D is to say that

  join {lower bounds of D in P'}
= meet D

where both join and meet are taken in P.  (I'm assuming that P is
complete; if not, respect of meets for D also asserts that the join and
the meet exist.)  In my first mail I described, vaguely, respect of limits
as meaning that the limit of the image is "no bigger than it needs to be".
Order theory is (unsurprisingly) the context in which this makes the most
sense: the greatest lower bound of D in P obviously needs to be greater
than all the lower bounds of D in P', but that understood, it's minimal.

The dual of Mamuka's statement is that, with D and P' and P as above, if D
has a lower bound in P then it has a greatest lower bound in P'.  Here's
an example where meets are respected but this condition (= relative
completeness?) fails.  Let 0 be the empty category.  For any category C,
the unique functor 0 ---> C respects limits if and only if C has an object
that is both initial and terminal.  So if 1 is the one-element lattice
then 0 ---> 1 respects meets, and the subset 0 of 0 has a lower bound in 1
but no lower bound in 0.

Normed combinatorial homology and noncommutative tori
Marco Grandis

Abstract.

        Cubical sets have a directed homology, studied in a previous paper
and consisting of preordered abelian groups, with a positive cone generated
by the structural cubes. By this additional information, cubical sets can
provide a sort of "noncommutative topology", agreeing with some results of
noncommutative geometry but lacking the metric aspects of C*-algebras.

        Here, we make such similarity stricter by introducing *normed*
cubical sets and their *normed* directed homology, formed of normed
preordered abelian groups. The normed cubical sets associated with
"irrational rotations" have thus the same classification up to isomorphism
as the well-known irrational rotation C*-algebras.

MSC: 55U10, 81R60, 55Nxx.
Keywords: Cubical sets, noncommutative C*-algebras, combinatorial homology,
normed abelian groups.

Here's a new paper that studies categorified Lie algebras:

Higher-Dimensional Algebra VI: Lie 2-algebras
John C. Baez and Alissa S. Crans

The theory of Lie algebras can be categorified starting from a
new notion of "2-vector space", which we define as an internal
category in Vect.  There is a 2-category Vect having these
2-vector spaces as objects, "linear functors" as morphisms and
"linear natural transformations" as 2-morphisms.  We define a
"semistrict Lie 2-algebra" to be a 2-vector space L equipped
with a skew-symmetric bilinear functor satisfying the Jacobi
identity up to a linear natural transformation called the
"Jacobiator", which in turn must satisfy a certain law of its
own.  This law is closely related to the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron
equation, and indeed we prove that any semistrict Lie 2-algebra
gives a solution of this equation, just as any Lie algebra gives
a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation.  We construct a 2-category
of semistrict Lie 2-algebras and prove that it is 2-equivalent
to the 2-category of 2-term L-infinity algebras in the sense
of Stasheff.  We also study strict and skeletal Lie 2-algebras,
obtaining the former from strict Lie 2-groups and using the
latter to classify Lie 2-algebras in terms of 3rd cohomology
classes in Lie algebra cohomology.

This paper will soon appear on the mathematics arXiv, but
the PDF version on my website looks a tiny bit better:

The paper

(R. BROWN and HIGGINS, P.J.), `Cubical abelian groups with
connections are equivalent to chain complexes', Homology, Homotopy
and Applications, 5(1) (2003) 49-52.

has a reference to Grothendieck's `cat\'egorie
cofibr\'ee....'  (1968)  SLNM 79, (the canonical reference for the first
question),
and also to Bourn (JPAA 1990), and gives a proof that 5 different
structures are, in an additive category with kernels, equivalent to chain
complexes.  Among these structures is strict globular omega-categories.
However, this is deduced from some non abelian and more difficult results.

Ronnie Brown







Dear Categorists -
Who first showed that an internal category in
the category of abelian groups was a 2-term chain
complex of abelian groups? What's a good reference?
Who first showed that an internal strict omega-category
in the category of abelian groups was a chain complex
of abelian groups? What's a good reference?
(Of course for "internal X in the category of Y's",
I am willing to accept "internal Y in the category of X's"
as a substitute.)
Best,

Borceux states the 'More General Adjoint Functor Theorem' in Vol 1, 6.6.1
of his Handbook.  This requires only that the codomain of the hoped-for
left adjoint is Cauchy-complete (and of course that the known functor has
some properties: it is 'absolutely flat' and satisfies some solution set
conditions).

Here's a representability theorem, presumably related.  Let C be a small,
Cauchy-complete category and let X: C ---> Set.  Then

   X is representable  <=>  X respects small limits.

The same goes for familial representability and connected limits.  Proofs
are at

  On a recent warm summer's Monday evening, I met Louis Nel, club
  founder and current president for a game and plenty of instruction.

                                * * *

  "It's a game with a magical touch," says Nel, a retired Professor of
  Mathematics at Carleton University with a PhD from Cambridge. "When
  I first saw the game, I was enchanted. My reaction was very similar
  to when I fell in love. There's a real kinship between croquet
  players who feel this. And it is definitely a different experience
  than meeting another toothbrush user."

  When he started playing croquet, Nel "knew nothing about the game at
  all. For me it was just an image out of Alice in Wonderland." But
  when the soft-spoken South African -- who is now a Team Canada
  player and ranked 18th in North America -- bought a toy croquet set
  for his four children from Canadian Tire, he was hooked. "The
  children moved on and thought of it as nothing more than a good
  game, but I saw that there was a lot more to croquet than a toy set.
  So I went to nearly every sports store in Ottawa and no one knew
  anything about the game."

  Nel pursued his passion for a real croquet set and once he'd found
  one he drove all the way to Toronto just to look at it. He didn't
  even buy it. But when he did finally buy a set, it had a copy of a
  croquet magazine in it and that was the lead he needed that set him
  on the path to founding Croquet Ottawa.

  For a year, Nel drove to Montreal once or twice a week to play at a
  Westmount club, but he realized that it was no long-term solution.
  He needed a club nearby and he realized that they only way to get it
  was to create it himself.

                                * * *

  Nel tells the story of a bunch of lawyers who came to play at the
  club for an office outing. As one young man lined up with a glint in
  his eye, he hit his opponent's ball to the far side of the court.
  "So sorry, Boss," he said with a huge grin. This captures the
  essence of the game. Croquet can be highly competitive and really
  quite nasty, but at the same time it's lots of fun.

its presence felt in Ottawa

BYLINE: Hattie Klotz

BODY: At the noisy corner of Bronson Avenue and Gladstone Street,
where trucks thunder by and a film of city grime and street dirt
covers almost everything, there's an oasis of calm. Sparkling like an
emerald in the dust, the smooth, green lawns of the Central Lawn
Bowling club form a square, bounded by chain-link fences, at this busy
intersection. It's here that Croquet Ottawa makes it home.

Croquet, you say? Yes, that childhood game that entails hitting a ball
through a hoop, once played on lawns and at cottages across the
country, has some serious players right here in Ottawa. While the
rules of the game vary according to geography (there's a North
American version, an international version, a version that is most
popular in Egypt, a cottage version), three times a week, the members
of Croquet Ottawa gather at the club on Gladstone or at Elmdale Lawn
Bowling club where they also have playing privileges, to enjoy a game
or two.

Croquet is the perfect way to pass a couple of hours. On a recent warm
summer's Monday evening, I met Louis Nel, club founder and current
president for a game and plenty of instruction. As soon as club
members measured out the correct distances on the court -- croquet is
nothing if not a game of precision -- and hammered in the hoops, two
games got underway side-by-side.

We played Golf Croquet, a version of the game that was new to me, but
proved simple and easy to grasp. There were plenty of exciting moments
during our fast and fluid game. And I found that as I concentrated on
each of my plays and their consequences several turns down the line,
everything but the game faded into the background. I didn't notice the
noise from the street. I couldn't imagine that I was in the middle of
the city. It was enough to be simply playing croquet.

The sound of mallet on ball and the satisfying thud when struck
cleanly and correctly, absorbed my attention. I realized croquet is
more than a game for children and elderly aunts. It is a game of
strategy. It is a mental game, somewhat like a cross between snooker
and croquet. It's a game for the soul too, as there's a serene,
timeless quality about playing as the sun sets and the lights come on
around this small square of green in the middle of so much concrete.
There's a certain contemplative side to croquet, since it's not
athletically demanding. And it's always played in beautiful
surroundings on velvet-smooth lawns.

"It's a game with a magical touch," says Nel, a retired Professor of
Mathematics at Carleton University with a PhD from Cambridge. "When I
first saw the game, I was enchanted. My reaction was very similar to
when I fell in love. There's a real kinship between croquet players
who feel this. And it is definitely a different experience than
meeting another toothbrush user."

When he started playing croquet, Nel "knew nothing about the game at
all. For me it was just an image out of Alice in Wonderland." But when
the soft-spoken South African -- who is now a Team Canada player and
ranked 18th in North America -- bought a toy croquet set for his four
children from Canadian Tire, he was hooked. "The children moved on and
thought of it as nothing more than a good game, but I saw that there

magazine in it and that was the lead he needed that set him on the
path to founding Croquet Ottawa.

For a year, Nel drove to Montreal once or twice a week to play at a
Westmount club, but he realized that it was no long-term solution. He
needed a club nearby and he realized that they only way to get it was
to create it himself.

Croquet Ottawa was formed in 1994 with founding members Ken Shipley, a
co-team Canada member who stills plays at the club -- his Team Canada
sign remains above the door in the clubhouse -- and Robert Armstrong,
who has now moved to Northern California, "but who gave me the nudge
of encouragement and was a constant spiritual presence and
enthusiasm," says Nel. "When you're starting something like this, you
need some luck and for me, Ken has been a real shot in the arm.
Another is Dean Chamberlain, a very gregarious man who has recruited
many players." Chamberlain is vice-president of the club and Shipley
began playing 10 years ago when he played at a garden party and, "had
bad knees from tennis so was looking for something else to do," he
says.

Croquet Ottawa now counts approximately 10 regular players among its
members. They make up a snapshot of Canadian demographics. There are a
couple of Canadians, a South African, an Englishman, a Ukrainian and
an Italian.

The evening I played, our foursome consisted of me, a Brit, Stuart, a
Canadian, Louis, South African and Marco, an Italian. Only in Canada
could this happen. They don't play croquet in Italy. "I was looking
for a summer sport," explained Marco, "as I snowboard in the winter
and I just didn't know what to do. A friend suggested I try this and
..." Well, four years later, Marco plays at a competitive level, with
a glint in his eye and a killer instinct. But in spite of the
opportunity for really vindictive and venomous play that croquet
presents -- it's all too tempting to hit another player's ball for six
-- "everybody is very relaxed and at peace in the club," says Nel,
"and we've never had a moment of strife."

Nel tells the story of a bunch of lawyers who came to play at the club
for an office outing. As one young man lined up with a glint in his
eye, he hit his opponent's ball to the far side of the court. "So
sorry, Boss," he said with a huge grin. This captures the essence of
the game. Croquet can be highly competitive and really quite nasty,
but at the same time it's lots of fun.

Before the birth of Croquet Ottawa, there were other traces of the
game in the city, "principally on the lawns of private homes in
Rockcliffe," says Nel. But there's also a croquet court in Rockcliffe
Park. Directly opposite Ashbury School, the lawn is a hidden gem.
Enclosed by eight-foot tall cedar hedges, it has a newly refurbished
clubhouse, flowerbeds overflowing with day lilies, picnic tables and
benches under fruit trees and scattered pieces of stone sculpture.

"It used to be a lawn bowling club," says Brian Murray, "that saw it's
heyday in the 1950s and '60s. It was a very busy part of Rockcliffe
social life. But it became primarily a croquet club in the 1980s," due
to the enthusiasm of Patrick Murray, former Mayor of Rockcliffe Park.
"He had the lawn specially seeded and mowed. We measured it out to
international standards and brought in experts from Saratoga, New York
and West Palm Beach in Florida. We played tournaments with these clubs
and we used to have a diplomatic tournament. There's even a huge
trophy. It's a giant croquet mallet, about 10 feet tall."

But with the amalgamation of Rockcliffe with the City of Ottawa two
years ago, the club died. "The minute Rockcliffe lost its autonomy,
the city really didn't have the funds to put into the upkeep of the
lawn," says Murray. Now, during the winter the land is turned into a
skating rink for children, which means that the grass is destroyed
come spring.

Croquet is a game that is dear to many people's hearts. It's easy to
grasp and can be played at many levels. It's a welcoming game and so
are the members of Croquet Ottawa. While we're playing, a man and a
small boy stop their bikes and peer through the fence. "What are you
doing?" chirps the boy. "We're playing croquet," someone replies. "Ah,
yes," sighs the man, "I used to play when I was a child." A couple of
minutes later the pair have cycled around the fence to the club gate.
They lean their bikes up against a bench and watch for a moment.
Within minutes, Ken Shipley has given the pair a hoop, a mallet and a
brightly coloured ball and they're practising happily at the end of
the court.

Croquet Ottawa is holding an Association tournament at the Elmdale
Lawn Bowling Club on July 26 and 27. Information on the club can be

Ramifications of Category Theory

A Workshop
including a featured lecture series by F. W. Lawvere


A Workshop on the Ramifications of Category Theory will take place in
Florence, Italy, from November 18 to November 22, 2003.


The workshop will pay attention not only to issues internal to category
theory, and in particular to topos theory, but also to manifold
relationships of category theory with topology, logic, philosophy, physics
and theoretical computer science, as witnessed by the list of invited
speakers. The aim is that of providing a recognition of present-day
frontiers of category-theoretic research and a perspective on future
research in the field, with emphasis on the foundations of mathematics and
the applications of category theory.



The workshop is also intended to honor Professor F.W. Lawvere on the 40th
anniversary of his Doctoral thesis on Functorial Semantics for Algebraic
Theories and to help bring into clearer focus the philosophical consequences
of his work, in particular the deep unification of geometry, algebra and
logic and of the concepts and tools of these areas of mathematics which have
stemmed from it.



Professor Lawvere will give a series of lectures, one central topic of which
will be quality, in its relation to space and quantity. Intensive and
extensive aspects of quality, together with an adjoint characterization of
it will be examined.

The general goal of his lectures will be to concentrate some
essentials from research in algebra and geometry to arrive at precise
philosophical formulations as a guide to the pursuit of learning and
future research in mathematical sciences.

Recently Volume 4 of Kurt Godel=92s Collected Works came out.
Volume 4 and 5 are correspondences. There is some discussion of
category theory that I thought might be of interest. The relevant
portions have been extracted. First is Godel=92s letter to Bernays.
Then Bernays=92 response. Finally there is Solomon Feferman
discussion.

Letter 47. Godel to Bernays (9 January 1963) on page 221:
=93... I found it interesting that you speak on P. 199 of the
=93newer abstract disciplines of mathematics=94 as something lying
outside of set theory. I conjecture that you are thereby alluding
to the concept of category and to the self-applicability of
categories. But it seems to me that all of this is contained
within a set theory with a finitely iterated notion of class,
where reflexivity results automatically through a =93typical
ambiguity=94 of statements. Isn=92t that also your opinion? I=92ve
heard, by the way, that someone has formulated the axioms of set
theory with the aid of the concept of category and that this has
perhaps even been published. If you know something about it, I
would be very grateful to you for relevant information.=94



Letter 48. Bernays to Godel (23 February 1963) on pages 229-231:
=93That in the enumeration of the domains of mathematics in which
the classical methods come to be used, I named the =93newer
abstract disciplines=94 in addition to analysis and set theory was
conceived in the sense of a distinction between categorical and
hypothetical mathematics. Abstract axiomatic topology and algebra
can be pursued in such a way that one indeed uses concepts like
that of natural number and real number as well as set-theoretical
concepts and theorems, without undertaking a strict incorporation
into set theory.
As to the difficulties associate with =93categories=94, of which Mr.
Mac Lane spoke in his Warsaw address, I have only a rough idea of
the requirements in question. All the same, it seems to me that
the difficulties rest at least in part on the fact that it is
exclusively the extensional characterization of categories that
is being considered.  In an analogous way, for example, if we
characterize the number 5 by means of the class of five-element
sets, there is an impediment to forming a class with the number 5
as [an] element. To be sure, categories are also effectively
given by means of axiom systems, and the multiplicity of the
axiom systems that have to be considered can presumably be
represented as a set, and certainly as a class. Your idea that a
set theory with a finitely iterated notion of class is suitable
as a framework for the theory of categories seems very plausible
to me. If axiomatic set theory is being extended in any event,
then the other novel infinitistic investigations should also find
a place in the extended framework. Just recently I received a
manuscript of the dissertation submitted ny William Hanf, in
which the author expresses the opinion in an introductory chapter
that for his investigations a set theory with a finitely iterated
notion of class does not suffice as an axiomatic framework.
=93That someone recently formulated the axioms of set theory with
the help of the notion of category I learned for the first time
from your letter.=94



This is Solomon Feferman=92s discussion of the correspondence on
pages 59-60:
=93Foundations of category theory. The foundational aspects of the
subject of category theory came up for discussion in Godel=92s
letter of 9 January 1963 (number 47); his point of departure was
a remark in Bernays 1961a to the effect that =93the =91newer=92
abstract disciplines of mathematics=92 [are] something lying
outside of set theory.=94 Godel assumed (mistakenly as it turned
out) that Bernays was =93thereby alluding to the concept of
category and to the self-applicability of categories=94. With
reference to self-applicability, what Godel presumably had in
mind are examples such as the category of all categories, for
which there is no straightforward set-theoretical interpretation.
He went on, interestingly, to suggest that such cases of
self-reference could be handled through =93typical ambiguity=94
applied to an extension of set theory by classes of finite type.
Actually, something like that had been pursued in the
Grothendieck school of homological algebra (e.g., in Gabriel
1962), which assumes 9instead of higher types) the existence of
arbitrarily many =93universes=94, i.e., collections of sets closed
under various standard operations, such as the stages Va in the
cumulative hierarchy for a strongly inaccessible. But for typical
ambiguity, one would need that the properties (in the language of
set theory, or higher type theory as suggested by Godel) of any
universe used are the same as in any other universe. Kreisel
suggested in 1965, pp.117-118, the required applications could
just as well be taken care of by use of the reflection principle
in set theory without the assumption of inaccessible cardinals;
the idea was spelled out and verified to a considerable extent in
Feferman 1969, though not all the problems were dealt with
thereby.

=93Also in letter 47, Godel said that he had heard =93that someone
has formulated the axioms of set theory with the aid of the
concept of category and that this has perhaps even been
published,=94 and he asked Bernays if he knew anything about it.
The first publication of an axiomatic theory of the category of
sets was by F. William Lawvere in his 1964; since that appeared
in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, it is
possible that Godel had heard of its submission through one of
the other members of the academy. In any case, Bernays=92 response
in letter 48 was not really helpful in dealing further with
either question concerning category theory, and the subject was
not pursued further in the correspondence.=94
