Dear Professor Lawvere,

Thanks for your clarifications and views in response to my latest note.
Coming from an applications-oriented environment, I do assume a set of
Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms with a universe of small sets (as prescribed in CWM) in order to
ensure access to a fully viable arithmetic of natural transformations. This
seems to allow for more than enough categories for my purposes, but it certainly
does give the category of small functions a prominence which can feel
artificially restrictive at times. Thus I would be especially attentive to any
comments which you might make specifically on the functorial isomorphism (I presume
to call it a "Lawvere isomorphism" )  which, in converting the Yoneda picture
(function-valued natural transformations) of categorical duality into the
Lawvere picture (cocompatible functors), represses the category of small functions
and, as I do realize, moves things into the context of the general existence
theory of adjunctions and Kan extensions, possibly providing a functorial
interpretation of your explanation of the origin of comma categories. By now this
isomorphism seems to me to be more of a perspicuous relabelling than a
redefiner of concepts, so that I have to plead innocent to your apparent conviction
that I agonize over the definition of elements. I am in full accord with the
doctrine of elements as you have described it, and the Lawvere isomorphism
actually relieves some conceptual agony in this regard by smoothly ensuring that, to
within a label, the elements of a function-valued functor constitute a
(limit) object which is in the functor's codomain category.  But I have to restate
my belief that the otherwise perfectly redeemable sentence, "An element of a
functor is an attaching functor into the category of elements of the functor,"
is unacceptably confusing due to the fact that the category of elements of a
functor does not in any sense consist of the elements of the functor (as you
would describe them). So I would rename it.

Pat Donaly

The motivation for introducing 40 years ago the construction,
of which "categories of elements" is a special case, was to make clear the
elementary nature of the notion of adjointness. Given an opposed pair
of functors between two arbitrary given categories, one obviously
elementary way of providing them with an adjointness is to give two
natural transformations satisfying two equations; but very useful also is
the definition in terms of bijections of hom sets which should be
equivalent. The frequent mode for expressing the latter in terms of
presheaf categories involved the complicated logical notion of "smallness"
and the additional axiom that a category of small sets actually exists,
but had the disadvantage that it would therefore not apply to arbitrarily
given categories. By contrast, a formulation of this bijection in terms of
discrete fibrations required no such additional apparatus and was
universally applicable.

Unfortunately, since I had given the construction no name, people in
reading it began to use the unfortunate term "comma". It would indeed be
desirable to have a more objective name for such a basic construction.
(The notation involving the comma was generalized from the very special
case when the two functors to B, to which the construction is applied,
both have the category 1 as domain, and the result of the construction is
the simple hom set in B between the two objects, which is often denoted by
placing a comma between the names of the objects and enclosing the whole
in parentheses.)

One habit which it would be useful to drop is that of agonizing over the
true definition of elements. In any category the elements of an object B
are the maps with codomain B, these elements having various forms which
are their domains. For example, if the category has a terminal object, we
have in particular the elements often called punctiform. On the other
hand, it is often appropriate to apply the term point to elements more
general than that, for example, in algebraic geometry over a
non-algebraically closed field, points are the elements whose forms are
the spectra of extensions of the ground field. As Volterra remarked
already in the 1880s, the elements of a space are not only points, but
also curves, etc.; it is often convenient to use the term "figure" for
elements whose forms belong to a given subcategory.

As Tom Leinster has told you about his new job, maybe I should do the same...

A project to study "ABSTRACT STONE DUALITY" has been funded by the
EPSRC (the UK funding agency for the exact sciences), as a result of
which I have a job for three years in the
	Mathematical Foundations Group,
	Department of Computer Science,
	University of MANCHESTER
and so have new email and web addresses
	pt@cs.man.ac.uk
	www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pt
I am very much looking forward to working with my new colleagues
there, including Peter Aczel, David Rydeheard, Andrea Schalk and
Harold Simmons.

Please note that, whilst I shall be making regular visits to Manchester,
for the time being I shall continue to live and work in LONDON (four
hours away by train).  If, therefore, you want to send me anything by
post, please see my web page or ask me by email for my home address.

My email is forwarded from pt@dcs.qmw.ac.uk, pt@dcs.qmul.ac.uk and
pt@di.unito.it, so please do not send it to multiple addresses.

		--------------------------------

Although funding for this project was in fact confirmed two months ago,
I delayed making this announcement because I wanted to say at the same
time that
	all of my WEB PAGES have been thoroughly revised,
(though, needless to say, they haven't yet).

Nevertheless, amongst my PAPERS linked from  www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pt  are

	- the ABSTRACT STONE DUALITY papers and proposal,

	- the HTML version of my book, "PRACTICAL FOUNDATIONS",

	- my older papers on CONTINUOUS, STABLE & SYNTHETIC DOMAIN THEORY

	- also on INTUITIONISTIC SETS AND ORDINALS and CATEGORICAL RECURSION

PLUS  *** NEW!!! ***

	- my teaching materials for the first year computer science
	  course INTRODUCTION TO ALGORITHMS that I taught at QMW.

	- the complete text of Jean-Yves Girard's book PROOFS AND TYPES,
	  as this is now out of print.

	- a translation of Gauss's second proof (1815) of the "fundamental
	  theorem of algebra" (every polynomial has a complex root)

Then of course there are (La)TeX MACROS (still in need of new web pages)

	- my famous DIAGRAMS package (which now supports PDFTEX)

	- PROOF TREES and BOXES

	- QED macros (with new documentation)

	- supermarket bar codes (OK, nothing to do with category theory)

The papers are available in the usual variety of formats, whilst their
web pages have been designed to allow navigation entirely in DVI or PDF
format, using XDVI, XPDF or ACROREAD.  This of course is prone to bugs,
so please tell me if any of the links go astray.

If there are any other (mathematical or programming) materials of mine
that you still consider useful, but which haven't been included or
updated in the new web pages, please ask.

		--------------------------------

Amongst 48 proposals that they considered in that quarter, the EPSRC
Computer Science panel ranked this one equally amongst the top three,
on the basis of four outstanding referees' reports.  My two nominated
referees were GRAHAM WHITE and RICHARD WOOD, to whom I would like
to express my appreciation for their support.  Graham had in fact
also helped me to write the proposal in the first place.

EPSRC rules did not allow me to submit this proposal in my own name,
as I did not have a teaching (or indeed any) job.  (In fact, they
don't even allow people to buy themselves out of their teaching, just
to employ other people to do the research for them, which makes some
sense in experimental sciences, but not really in mathematics.)

The success of this proposal follows a period of 20 months during
which I continued to work on this research programme and attend
conferences funded from my own savings --- and, I would like to
make clear, NOT from social security.

My attendance at SOME of the meetings was paid for by Birmingham,
Dalhousie, St. Mary's and Turin Universities and the EU APPSEM project.

I would not, however, have had the emotional energy to do this without
the constant support of my partner, RICHARD SYMES, who let me pursue
Plan A, even though (being a modern languages graduate) he had no clue
what it was about, or - until he saw the referees' reports - whether
it had any prospects of success.

I would also like to thank MARIANGIOLA DEZANI of the Universita` degli
Studi di Torino for her offer of funding, even though it turned out
that certain Italian bureaucracy didn't allow it. Her support, and
her personal hospitality when I visited Turin, meant a lot to me.

		--------------------------------

Finally, I feel that having paid for myself to attend conferences gives
me the prerogative to make a comment on the way that they are organised:

I deplore the practice of charging those like me (and numerous others,
some of them important members of our community) who have had to pay
for their own research, to subsidise "senior" people as guest speakers,
with longer time-slots at conferences.

These people have research grants and professorial salaries from rich
universities.  I have noticed, however, that it is the guest speakers
who most commonly over-run their allotted time, and sometimes present
material that would not have been accepted from others by the referees.

Dear Categorists -

Some of you might be interested in this talk, since it's secretly
about attempts to categorify the rational numbers.

http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cardinality/

Euler Characteristic versus Homotopy Cardinality

Abstract:

Just as the Euler characteristic of a space is the alternating sum of the
dimensions of its rational cohomology groups, the homotopy cardinality of
a space is the alternating product of the cardinalities of its homotopy
groups.  The two quantities have many of the same properties, but it's
hard to tell if they're the same, since like Jekyll and Hyde, they're
almost never seen together: there are very few spaces for which the Euler
characteristic and homotopy cardinality are both well-defined. However,
in many cases where one is well-defined, the other may be computed by
dubious manipulations involving divergent series - and the two then agree!
We give examples of this phenomenon and beg the audience to find some
unifying concept which has both Euler characteristic and homotopy cardinality
as special cases.

Apparently Graeme's approach to infinite sloop spaces or rather
to one fold loop spaces
has be further abstracted to produce what is known as a `Segal category'

at a quick glance, it seems to me these are related to Fukaya's A_\infty
cats
as my approach to \Omega X is related to Graeme's

anyone seen this worked out or even commented on?

The comparison between Segal categories and A infinity categories
works in close analogy with the comparison between A infinity spaces
(for any A infinity operad) and Segal's special Delta spaces.  The
topological comparison was worked out in papers of Thomason and
Fiedorowicz, themselves analogues of earlier work of Thomason and
myself comparing infinite loop space machines.  The categorical
comparison will appear in a paper I'm writing --- I've talked about
it at MSRI and the Newton Institute.   Peter May

Yes, that's what I had in mind
question is: does it carry over to (Fukaya) A_\infty cats and Segal
cats?

I'm not sure where the above quote is taken from but I agree it is confusing.

Here is my argument in favour of the traditional name.

As Bill says, an element of an object F in a category is generally
any morphism A --> F  into  F.  It just happens that in many
categories  F  is determined by elements with a restricted class of
domains  A.  In Set, we can restrict  A  to be terminal.  In a
presheaf category, we can restrict  A  to be representable.  The
objects of the category  elF  of elements of  F  are (up to
isomorphism) elements  A --> F  with  A  representable.  It is also
conventional to name categories after their objects (although the
Ehresmann convention of naming them after their morphisms is more
precise). Hence  elF  is the category of elements of  F.

Ross

Good Morning:

I have a question about "standard terminology" or "standard
methodology". Is there a standard technique to generate the closure of
a set through generating the next element from the current? The
motivating idea is a simple one: generate a free language from the list
of characters. This is a standard inductive process seen in lots of
automata and formal language books. Seems like there is product
followed by a co-product sort of action.

best regards,

steve

Hello all --

Apologies for what may be an elementary question:  Does anyone know of a
fully-worked-through, category-theoretic treatment of the differential
calculus?

Thanks,

Dear Categorists -

Do any of you know particularly insightful treatments of
quantum logic via category theory?  I'm more or less familiar
with quantum logic as the theory of the complete orthocomplemented
lattice of closed subspaces of a given Hilbert space.  But now I'm
interested in developing quantum logic starting as much as possible
from general properties of and structures on the category of
Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps - for example, the fact
that it's an abelian category, and becomes a *-category and symmetric
monoidal category in a nice way (with Hilbert tensor product as the
monoidal structure).  And I'm interested in things like how the
2-dimensional Hilbert space acts a bit like a subobject classifier.

I don't mind sticking with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces for now
to avoid certain subtleties.

On a related note: I've repeatedly heard people say something
like "the multiplicative fragment of linear logic is the internal
logic of (closed symmetric?) monoidal categories", but I've never heard
a precise result along these lines.  Has anyone worked out a sufficiently
general concept of "the internal logic of a category" or "the
internal logic of a certain 2-category of categories" so that one
could take something like a monoidal category, or a symmetric monoidal
category, or a closed symmetric monoidal category - or maybe the
2-category of all such - and extract by some systematic method the
corresponding "internal logic"?  I'm vaguely imagining some class
of generalizations of the Mitchell-Benabou language of a topos, or
something like that - but I'm really interested in the nonCartesian
case.

The reason I ask this is that it would be nice if you could
throw the (closed, symmetric, monoidal, *, etcetera...) category
of Hilbert spaces into some big machine and have "quantum logic"
pop out - and then throw in other similar categories, and have other
kinds of logic pop out.

Best,
jb

Hi John -

You might want to take a look at the paper by Robin Cockett and me
"Proof theory for full intuitionistic linear logic, bilinear logic, and mix
categories " in TAC Vol 3 No 5.

  ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/1997/n5/n5.ps

As for a general theory - there are plenty of examples, though I don't know
if anyone has really made a general theory of this notion of a categorical
doctrine, often referred to, and based on a paper of Kock and Reyes from the
70's.  But there are many examples (many in the papers  Robin and I have
written on linearly distributive categories and related structures - visit
my webpage if you're interested), which make clear how to go from the
internal logic of a category to the category and back.  I suggest also you
look at our "Introduction to  linear bicategories" (MSCS:10(2000)2 pp
165-203), also available on my webpage, for a higher dimensional approach.

 - all the best, Robert

I will let others answer about the connection between closed monoidal
categories and MLL, but I just wanted to say that I am not sure what you
mean by the category of Hilbert spaces.  If you want the inner product
preserved, then only isometric injections are permitted.  If you want just
bounded linear maps then you are not making any real use of the inner
product.  And the spaces are self-dual, so it is not a good model of
*-autonomy.  Perhaps of compact categories, I would have to think about
it.  But anyway, you have to say what category is meant.  Another
possibility is partial isometries (which can be thought of as total by
being zero on the subspace orthognal to the domain).  This is a lot like
sets and partial injections.

Michael

Right.  I wanted to leave things flexible so different readers could
interpret my question in different ways, but I also tried to hint
that I think it's crucial to work with the *-category Hilb whose objects
are Hilbert spaces, whose morphisms are bounded linear maps, and whose
*-structure sends the bounded linear map f: H -> H' to its Hilbert
space adjoint f*: H' -> H.  This *-structure can be used to define
concepts crucial for quantum mechanics, like "self-adjoint" and
"unitary" operators, as well as "isometric injections".  Isometric
injections are a nice way to study subobjects in Hilb, but they're
not good enough for doing full-fledged quantum mechanics, nor is
ignoring the inner product altogether.

Category theorists are often a bit uncomfortable with *-categories
because they prefer "adjoints" that are defined using other structure
rather than put in by brute force.  However, I'm convinced that we
can only understand how quantum field theory exploits the analogy
between differential topology and Hilbert space theory if we think
about *-categories.  For example, a topological quantum field theory
is a symmetric monoidal functor from some *-category of cobordisms
to the *-category Hilb - but the most physically realistic TQFTs are
the "unitary" ones, which preserve the *-structure.

I've talked about this *-stuff and the nascent concept of "n-categories
with duals" in my papers on 2-Hilbert spaces

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/2hilb.ps

and 2-tangles

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/hda4.ps

and now I want to say a bit about how it impinges on quantum
logic - but to avoid reinventing the wheel, I'd like to hear
anything vaguely relevant anyone knows about approaching quantum
logic with an eye on category theory.

(I know a bit about quantales, but maybe there's other stuff
I've never heard of.)

Hi John,

One of the ideas behind the theory of quantales is that the category of
"sheaves" on a given quantale should be a topos in *some* generalized
sense, whose subobject classifier would be a quantale (which is then
related to the multiplicative fragment of a noncommutative linear
logic). There are a few papers by various authors addressing sheaves on
quantales, however none getting near a satisfactory definition of
"quantum topos", but I don't think the field is exhausted. In
particular Chris Mulvey wrote a paper with his student Nawaz (you can
download it from Chris' web page), but restricted to idempotent
right-sided quantales, which form a rather limited class. Nevertheless
that paper gives you a category of sheaves which actually is a topos in
the classical sense, but equipped with additional structure that
provides the "quantum" part. I know that currently he has been working
with another student on an extension of this to a more general
situation encompassing all involutive quantales (= involutive monoids
in the monoidal category of sup-lattices), and last time I heard about
it the results looked promising.

The significance of this wrt Hilbert spaces is that once you consider
involutive quantales of the form "Max(A)" (ie, those consisting of all
the closed linear subspaces of a unital C*-algebra A), there is a
notion of "irreducible representation" of Max(A) that classifies up to
unitary equivalence the irreducible representations of A, and, to a
certain extent still in need of further clarification (very preliminary
material is in a paper of mine which is due to appear in the J. Algebra
and is downloadable from my web page - still a couple of typos and
minor bugs in the on-line version, I'm afraid), the category of
representations of A is approximated by the corresponding category of
quantale modules over Max(A). (Each representation of A on a Hilbert
space H induces in a natural way an action of Max(A) on the lattice of
closed linear subspaces of H.) By all of this I mean that ultimately
the category of sheaves on Max(A) should provide a logical handle on
the category of representations of A, and it seems reasonable to expect
that what you are saying about the category of Hilbert spaces and
bounded linear maps may relate to this general scheme.

Best,

Pedro.

                         First Call For Papers

            17th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop

                          June 28 - 30, 2004

                   Asilomar, Pacific Grove, CA, USA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sponsored by the Technical Committee on Security and Privacy of the IEEE
Computer Society

This workshop series brings together researchers in computer science to
examine foundational issues in computer security. We are interested both
in new results in theories of computer security and also in more
exploratory presentations that examine open questions and raise
fundamental concerns about existing theories. Both papers and panel
proposals are welcome.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

Access control       Authentication            Data and system integrity
Database security    Network security          Distributed systems security
Anonymity            Intrusion detection       Security for mobile computin=
g
Security protocols   Security models           Decidability issues
Privacy              Executable content        Formal methods for security
Information flow     Language-based security

For background information about the workshop, and an html version of this
Call for Papers, see http://www.csl.sri.com/csfw/index.html (the CSFW home
page). This year the workshop will be held in Pacific Grove, CA, USA.
Information about the location and the organization will be soon available
on the web page. (http://www.csl.sri.com/csfw/csfw17).

The proceedings are published by the IEEE Computer Society Press and will
be available at the workshop. Selected papers will be invited for
submission to the Journal of Computer Security.


Instructions for Participants
-----------------------------

Submission is open to anyone.  Workshop attendance is limited to about 50
participants.  Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that
have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings.  Papers should be at most 20 pages long
excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices (using 11-point font,
single column format, and reasonable margins on 8.5"x11" paper), and at mos=
t
25 pages total.  Alternatively, papers can be submitted using the two-colum=
n
IEEE Proceedings style available for various document preparation systems a=
t
ftp://pubftp.computer.org/Press/Outgoing/proceedings/.  Papers in this styl=
e
should be at most 12 pages long (at most 15 pages including bibliography an=
d
appendices).  The page limit will be strictly adhered to.  Committee member=
s
are not required to read the appendices, and so the paper should be
intelligible without them.  Proposals for panels should be no more than
five pages in length and should include possible panelists and an indicatio=
n
of which of those panelists have confirmed participation.

Instructions about how to submit a paper will be soon available on the web
page (http://www.csl.sri.com/csfw/csfw17). If for any reason you cannot
conform to those submission guidelines, please contact the program chair
at focardi@dsi.unive.it. Papers should be submitted in Postscript or
Portable Document Format (PDF).  Papers submitted in a proprietary
word-processor format such as Microsoft Word cannot be considered.

At least one coauthor of each accepted paper is expected to attend
CSFW-17. Papers that do not adhere to this policy will be removed from the
proceedings.

Workshop Location
-----------------

The 17th IEEE Computer Security Foundations workshop will be held
at the Asilomar Conference Center, located on the beautiful Monterey
Peninsula in Pacific Grove California.  Asilomar, meaning "refuge by the
sea", is a tranquil environment surrounded by forest and white sand
beaches.  As a member of the California State Park system, it offers
107 extraordinary acres of forests, dunes, and coastline situated on
the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.  Founded in 1913 as the
western conference center for the Young Women's Christian Association
(YWCA), it is the ideal conference setting.

Asilomar offers secluded guest rooms with forest or marine views.  Rooms
are clustered into quaint lodges, some of which feature fireplaces.  Sunset
walks along the beach and coastal trails are a great way to unwind.  On-sit=
e
recreation includes a heated swimming pool, volleyball and billiard tables.

Just minutes away is Pebble Beach, featuring world-class golf courses and
scenic 17-Mile Drive.  And some of the most breathtaking coastline in the
world can be found just 20 minutes to the south toward Big Sur along Hwy 1.
Also nearby is the Monterey Bay Aquarium, featuring spectacular, deep-sea
and
kelp forest exhibits.  Monterey Bay hosts a unique deep-sea environment
close to shore.  There is an underwater canyon over 2km deep at around 15km
from shore.

Asilomar is 2.3 hours by car from San Francisco International Airport
(SFO). There are direct flights between San Francisco and most major
European and American cities.  The Monterey regional airport (MRY) is 10
minutes by car from Asilomar.  There are direct flights to MRY from Los
Angeles International Airport (LAX) and SFO about every 2 hours until
10pm.  More travel information can be found on the CSFW17 website.

John --

Although not a categorical treatment, a recent paper by Kurt Engesser
and Dov Gabbay in <Artificial Intelligence> discusses a connection
between Quantum Logic and Hilbert spaces.   (The reason the work
appeared in the leading AI journal is that there are applications to
nonmonotonic reasoning, which is a major area of research in AI.)

Abstract

Our starting point is the observation that with a given Hilbert space H
we may, in a way to be made precise, associate a class of non-monotonic
consequence relations in such a way that there exists a one-to-one
correspondence between the rays of H and these consequence relations.
The projectors in Hilbert space may then be viewed as a sort of revision
operators. The lattice of closed subspaces appears as a natural
generalisation of the concept of a Lindenbaum algebra in classical
logic. The logics presentable by Hilbert spaces are investigated and
characterised. Moreover, the individual consequence relations are
studied. A key concept in this context is that of a consequence relation
having a pointer to itself. It is proved that such consequence relations
have certain remarkable properties in that they reflect their metatheory
at the object level to a surprising extent. The tools used in the
investigation stem from two different areas of research, namely from the
disciplines of non-monotonic logic on the one hand and from Hilbert
space theory on the other. There exist surprising connections between
these two fields of research the investigation of which constitutes the
purpose of this paper.

I think Rick Blute (+ collaborators) has done some things with this. It is
not clear whether you want a self-duality or a *-autonomous category.  If
you stick to finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, the situation seems
simple.  If V and W are inner product spaces, then for f, g: V --> W, let
f.g = \sum f(v_i).g(v_i) the sum taken over an orthonormal basis.  I
believe this is invariant to an orthonormal base change and it is
obviously positive definite.  For infinite dimensional spaces, you would
have to stick to f for which \sum f(v_i)^2 < oo.  But this isn't a
category.  It is closed under composition (I think) but certainly lacks
identities.  This gives rise to something called a nuclear category.  The
category has all maps and there is sub-non-category of nuclear maps.  This
all goes back (needless to say) to Grothendieck.

If by *-category you just mean self dual, well then Hilbert spaces
certainly are that.  Self dual categories are a dime a dozen.  Just take C
x C^op.  The amazing thing is that if C is closed, C x C^op is
*-autonomous, (assuming C has binary cartesian products).

In `higher homotopy theory', terminology has not setled down nor is it
transparent

homotopy ___________ algebra can mean a variety of things

letting ______________ = associative
it can mean JUST that there is a homtopy for associaitivity
or
some authors use it to mean A_\infty

which I initially tried to indicate by strongly homtopy associative

_\infty seems to have caught on to mean the presence of higher homtopies
of all orders

in most but not all cases, such algebras have a homtopy invariant
defintion

so I would suggest the following revisionist terminology

1-homotopy associative means JUST that there is a homotopy for
associaitivity

similarly n-homotopy associative would mean homotopies of homotopies
of...

homotopy invariant ___ algebra would mean just what it says

so far so good
but now what about e.g. 1-homotopy associaitve satisfying a STRICT
pentagon??

perhaps strict 1-homotopy

open to suggestions

In reply to Stasheff's question on terminology for homotopy coherent algebras:

>but now what about e.g. 1-homotopy associaitve satisfying a STRICT
>pentagon??
>perhaps strict 1-homotopy

I would say:

"2-strict sha-algebra", as motivated below.
(sha = strongly homotopy associative)

However: after the strict pentagon, this structure has a second coherence
condition for the associativity homotopy
(which disappears for monoidal categories, just because their 2-morphisms
are trivial)

____________

In a paper [*] on strongly homotopy associative (differential) algebras, I
proposed this definition (4.2; pages 38-39).

Notation: a sha-algebra is a graded module  A  with morphisms
(sort of components of a global differential  d of bar coalgebras)

   d_1: A --> A  (degree - 1; the differential)

   d_2: AoA --> A  (degree 0; the product)

   d_3: AoAoA --> A  (degree 1; the associativity 1-homotopy)
   ........
   d_n: A^n  -->  A   (degree  n - 2; the coherence n-homotopy)
   ........

( o = tensor product;  ^n  = tensor power)

under axioms

(1)  d_1.d_1 = 0
(2)  ....

(expressing  dd = 0  for the global differential).

DEF. This is called an *n-strict sha-algebra* if  d_p = 0  for  p > n.

Equivalently,  the morphisms  d_1,..., d_n  have to satisfy the original
axioms (1)  ... (n)
plus n - 1 conditions obtained from the axioms  (n+1) ... (2n - 1),
cancelling the null  d_p's
(the remaining axioms become trivial).

This gives:

1-strict = differential module

2-strict = associative differential algebra

3-strict = 1-homotopy associative differential algebra
   with strict pentagon (from axiom (3)) and axiom (4) reduced to:

   (4)   d3 (1o1od3 + 1od3o1 + d3o1o1) = 0.

_______

So far in that paper.
The name is chosen to make  d_n  the last relevant component, in the
n-strict case.

I might now (more geometrically) prefer a - 1 shift in these names, so that
the last example would be named 2-strict, in accord with the fact that the
last relevant homotopy is a an ordinary ("one-dimensional") homotopy and
everything becomes strict starting with "dimension 2".

After giving the matter some thought, I finally decided that the
category of Hilbert spaces should have as its morphisms norm-reducing
linear maps.  At the very least that will ensure that an isomorphism is
an isometry.  And yes the category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces
is *-autonomous.  The internal hom of two is the space of all linear
maps and the inner product <f,g> = \sum f(u_i)g(u_i), taken over an
orthonormal basis of the domain.  This can be shown to be invariant
under orthogonal change of  basis.  The norm of the identity on an
n-dimensional space is sqrt(n).  The dual of a space is itself, of
course with the duality being adjunction (or transpose).  Then the
tensor product H # G = (H --o G^*)^*.

Here is another approach to the same structure.  Consider a pair
(V,\phi) where V is a finite dimensional space and \phi is an
isomorphism of V with its dual space.  You have to add positive
definiteness and symmetry, but that is no problem.  Maps again are norm
reducing.  Now we can define (V,\phi) # (W,\psi) = (V # W,\phi # \psi),
(V,\phi)^* = (V,\phi^{-1}), and (V,\phi) --o (W,\psi) = (V # W,\phi^{-1}
# \psi).  The resultant category is exactly the same as before.

BTW, it is easy to see that the transpose of a norm-reducing map is norm
reducing.

True, but are you begging the question by trying to ensure that?
After all, an invertible bounded linear map is enough to deduce
that Hilbert spaces are isomorphic (even in the sense of isometric),
so why not count those maps as isomorphisms themselves?

This matter is much bigger than Hilbert spaces, of course;
moving to Banach spaces (a closed category even for arbitrary dimension),
we can even see how, /as/ a closed category, it doesn't really matter!
The question is, what is the forgetful functor from Ban to Set?
Do we take the set of all vectors? or do we take the closed unit ball?
The former corresponds to allowing all bounded linear maps as morphisms,
while the latter corresponds to requiring norm-reducing linear maps.
But in the closed category Ban, the Banach space of morphisms
is, whatever your conventions, the space of all bounded linear maps.
Still, this can be consistent with either choice of hom-SET,
since the closed unit ball in the Banach space of bounded linear maps
is none other than your preferred hom-set of norm-reducing maps.

Jim Dolan (IIRC) suggested that Ban is more fundamentally a closed category
than a category in the first place.

We can do this on a more elementary level with metric spaces;
is the hom-set the set of all Lipschitz continuous functions,
or is it only the set of distance-reducing functions?
But unlike with Banach (or Hilbert) spaces, this makes a difference
even to the classification of metric spaces into isomorphism classes.
The question becomes, is an isomorphism of metric spaces
merely a relabelling of points keeping all distances the same,
or does it also allow for a recalibration of ones ruler?
Which is the correct interpretation may depend on the application,
and how absolute -- rather than measured in some unit -- the distances are.
(One can even recalibrate more generously to allow as morphisms
all uniformly continuous maps, or even all continuous maps.

OK, that's a good point.  I agree (with the L-1 norm on the free space).

I will stick to my perception that if you dealing with Hilbert or Banach
spaces isomorphisms should be just that.  It makes no difference to the
*-autonomous structure anyway.

For Banach spaces, if you take as underlying functor the closed unit ball,
it has an adjoint.  It is not tripleable, however, but C^*-algebras are
(with the unit ball underlying functor).

I'll  address two of these questions.  The first:

> The question is, what is the forgetful functor from Ban to Set?
> Do we take the set of all vectors? or do we take the closed unit ball?
> The former corresponds to allowing all bounded linear maps as morphisms=
,
> while the latter corresponds to requiring norm-reducing linear maps.

Actually, when the "underlying-set functor" for Banach spaces
is taken to be the unit disk functor, and the morphisms are
taken as the norm-decreasing maps, the situation is really great,
because the norm-decreasing maps DO constitute the unit disk
of the Banach space of bounded linear transformations, as you know.
And products and coproducts are as Banach spacists like to see them
(the familiar L-infinity style "full direct product" and and L-1 =

style "weak direct product", respectively).

When the underlying-set functor is taken to be ALL the vectors =

of the Banach space, on the other hand, products and coproducts =

misbehave quite badly. =


As for the question,

> After all, an invertible bounded linear map is enough to deduce
> that Hilbert spaces are isomorphic (even in the sense of isometric),
> so why not count those maps as isomorphisms themselves?

I'd answer by saying that unless the invertible bounded linear map
in the question IS an isometry I'd never dare call it one.

Dear Categorists -

In my quest to understand how various flavors of monoidal
category can be seen as having various flavors of "internal
language" and "internal logic", I've been enjoying the section
in Johnstone's "Sketches of an Elephant" where he discusses
different fragments of first-order logic and how they can
be interpreted in categories with different properties.

Of course, this being a book on topos theory, none of this
deals with monoidal categories where the tensor product
is not cartesian - my main interest, for applications
to quantum logic.  But, it's still lots of fun.

I'd like to get a better feel for some of these things.
For example, he talks about

"cartesian categories"
"regular categories",
"geometric categories",
"coherent categories"

and describes which fragment of first-order logic can be
interpreted in each of these things:

"cartesian logic",
"regular logic",
"geometric logic"
"coherent logic".

Here's some stuff I think I know.  I know the definitions of
the above concepts, as long as I have the book open to the
right page... but I left it at home, so these could be wrong!

Cartesian categories have finite limits.  Regular categories
are cartesian categories with regular epi/mono factorizations,
which must be stable under pullbacks.  Geometric categories are
regular categories admitting arbitrary unions of subobjects,
which must be stable under pullbacks.   Coherent categories
are geometric categories where pullback of subobjects has a
right adjoint (which plays the role of "for all").

I have a fairly good feel for categories with finite limits and
"finite limits theories"; the others seem more mysterious to me,
since I don't know enough examples illustrating the distinctions.
Categories monadic over Set are regular, so AbGp is regular - but
it's not coherent, since in a coherent category every morphism to
the initial object is an isomorphism.  What are some other examples
of all these things?

                           2nd Workshop on

             QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

                         Barcelona - Spain
                      27th - 28th March, 2004
                   Satellite Event of ETAPS 2004

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                SCOPE

 Quantitative aspects of computation are important and sometimes
 essential in characterising the behaviour and determining the
 properties of systems. They are related to the use of physical
 quantities (storage space, time, bandwidth, etc.)
 as well as mathematical quantities (e.g. probability and measures
 for reliability, risk and trust). Such quantities play a central
 role in defining both the model of systems (architecture,
 language design, semantics) and the methodologies and tools for
 the analysis and verification of system properties.

 The aim of this workshop is to discuss the explicit use of
 quantitative information such as time and probabilities either
 directly in the model or as a tool for the analysis of systems.
 In particular, the workshop focuses on

 - the design of probabilistic and real-time languages and
   the definition of semantical models for such languages;

 - the discussion of methodologies for the analysis of probabilistic
   and timing properties  (e.g. security, safety, schedulability)
   and of other quantifiable properties such as reliability
   (for hardware components), trustworthiness (in information security)
   and resource usage (e.g., worst-case memory/stack/cache
   requirements);

 - the probabilistic analysis of systems which do not explicitly
   incorporate quantitative aspects  (e.g. performance, reliability
   and risk analysis);

 - applications to safety-critical systems, communication protocols,
   control systems, asynchronous hardware, and to any other domain
   involving quantitative issues.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               TOPICS

 Topics include (but are not limited to) probabilistic, timing and
 general quantitative aspects in

                Language design      Performance analysis
             Language extension      Program analysis
        Language expressiveness      Verification
 Hardware description languages      Asynchronous hardware analysis
                          Logic      Refinement
                      Semantics      Automated reasoning
            Coordination models      Model-checking
            Distributed systems      Security
          Time-critical systems      Safety
               Embedded systems      Risk and Hazard Analysis
          Multi-tasking systems      Scheduling theory

Sorry, in the maps-norm-decreasing, disk-as-underlying-set category,
even  RxR  gives you isometrically different Banach spaces for different
values of  p .(*)  Only the L-1 style norm gives you a coproduct,
only the L-infinity style norm gives you a product (using the
usual "as-vector-space" injections and projections); the other
choices of  p  give you god-only-knows-what.

As regards another point, I think this is dead wrong:

 > The L-oo style full direct product and the L-1 style weak direct product

coproduct).

Here's why: a bounded linear transformation to the L-oo style product
of a bunch of real lines, say (in the real Banach space case) arises
from a BOUNDED family of bounded linear functionals.  An UNbounded
family of bounded linear functionals WILL give you a continuous linear
transformation, of course, but NOT to the L-oo style product of  R 's
-- it will be taking values in the topological-vector-space product
of those  R 's.

Same problem, in reverse, for the L-1 style weak direct product as
coproduct: the bounded maps from, say, l_1(aleph-0) to a Banach space  B
correspond, after composing with the injections, to BOUNDED families
of maps  R --> B  (i.e., bounded families of vectors in  B ).
But ARBITRARY families of maps  R --> B  should have a common
extension to a continuous map from the coproduct of those  R 's.
So their L-1 style weak direct product (which is what l_1(aleph-0) is)
won't be the coproduct in the continuous-linear-transformation category.

Eilenberg, may he rest in peace, once summed up the dilemma:
are you talking about Banach spaces? or about Banachable spaces?
(Banachable spaces are topological vector spaces, complete in
their (uniform) topology, whose topology can come from a norm.)
In the latter case, continuous linear transformations
are all there is.  And if you want invertible bounded
linear transformations to be isomorphisms, Banachable
spaces is all you can be capturing.  But products, as
topological vector spaces, of too many Banachable spaces
are no longer Banachable; and coproducts ... are no longer
even uniformly complete.  So if you want to talk about
Banach spaces, with the expected L-1 style weak products
as coproducts and the expected L-oo style products as products,
then you are obviously focussed on the norms, and you've
got to be focussed on maps that don't increase the norms,
for otherwise you're only focussing on the Banachable aspect
of the topological vector spaces underlying your Banach spaces.

As to other remarks:

> If I were talking with John Baez, and he had just said
> that he was accepting all bounded linear maps as morphism,

And I'd understand he was interested only in Banachable TVSes, and
not actually in Banach spaces.

> (But in a general context, I would call /only/ isometries isomorphisms,
> because otherwise people might get confused about what I meant!)

This would tell me you're interested not merely in Banachable
spaces, but in actual Banach spaces.

> I say this just to remind us that we're discussing which category is /best/,
> not which category is /correct/.

Both categories (Banach spaces -- with norm-non-increasing maps,
and Banachable spaces, with continuous linear transformations)
are useful categories.  But even their objects are different, not
just the maps allowed between two particular Banach spaces.

> (There's the additional matter that the "unit disk functor"

That's because Banachable spaces have no unit disks -- it's
not that "the 'unit disk functor' isn't a functor at all,"
it's that there isn't even a CANDIDATE for object-function
of a putative unit disk functor!

Nonetheless, both categories -- Ban , and  Banachable -- though
far from equivalent, have their uses.

And  Ban , though not monadic over  Sets  via its unit disk functor, as
Mike Barr has correctly pointed out, IS a full reflective subcategory
of the category of algebras over the monad for that unit-disk functor;
in that regard, it somewhat resembles the category of torsion-free
abelian groups (likewise not monadic, yet fully reflective in the
category of algebras for its underlying set functor, viz., in Ab.Gps).

Hope these comments help.

(*)PS: by a fluke, l_1(n) and l_oo(n)
can be made isometric, for n=2:

send (1, 0) in l_1(2) to (1, 1) in l_oo(2), and
send (0, 1) in l_1(2) to (-1, 1) in l_oo(2), and
extend by linearity.

This is the linear map  R^2 --> R^2  that rotates by 45 degrees
and then multiplies by  square.root(2) , and it carries
the l_1 unit diamond onto the l_oo unit square.

I don't think anything like this can work for exhibiting
isometries between l_1(2) and l_p(2) for any other p,
and I don't think anything like this can work for l_1(n) and l_oo(n)
for any n > 2.

But enough for now.

-- F.

I have just posted a minor upgrade of diagxy.  At the suggestion of a
graduate student at Kent State named Gerd Zeibig, I have added a new
feature that allows to identify nodes of a diagram with short identifiers
and then draw arrows between those nodes.  He had implemented this and
asked me what I thought.  I found a simpler way than he (he had defined
over 100 new counters and the number of counters that tex allows is 256,
so they are considered a rare commodity; my code uses only 2 new
counters).  This kind of reintroduces the matrix mode except with absolute
positioning of the vertices.  The results are found, as usual, in
ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr/diagxy.zip.

CAV'04 is colocated with the International ACM Symposium on Software
Testing and Analysis, ISSTA'04.

Invited speakers for CAV'04 are David Harel (Weizmann Institute, plenary
speaker for the joint CAV-ISSTA session), Mary Jean Harrold (Georgia Institute
of Technology), and Tom Reps (University of Wisconsin).

CAV will be preceded by an invited tutorial on processor verification by
Randy Bryant (Carnegie Mellon University), David Dill (Stanford University),
and Warren Hunt (University of Texas, Austin). The conference will be
followed by special workshops.


Paper submission:
There are two categories of submissions:

 A. Regular papers. Submissions, not exceeding thirteen (13) pages
    using Springer's LNCS format, should contain original research, and
    sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution.
    For papers reporting experimental results, authors are strongly
    encouraged to make their data available with their submission.
    Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or
    submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is
    not allowed.

CTCS'04 is the 10th Conference on Category Theory and Computer
Science. The purpose of the conference series is the advancement of
the foundations of computing using the tools of category theory.  The
emphasis is upon applications of category theory, but it is recognized
that the area is highly interdisciplinary.

Typical topics of interest include, but are not limited to,
category-theoretic aspects of the following:

coalgebras and computing
concurrent and distributed systems
constructive mathematics
declarative programming and term rewriting
domain theory and topology
foundations of computer security
linear logic
modal and temporal logics
models of computation
program logics, data refinement, and specification
programming language semantics
type theory

Previous meetings have been held in Guildford (Surrey), Edinburgh (twice),
Manchester, Paris, Amsterdam, Cambridge, S. Margherita Ligure (Genova), and
Ottawa.

The proceedings of the conference will be published as a special issue
of ENTCS (Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science).

Invited Speakers:
	Francois Bergeron
	Martin Hyland
	Robin Milner
	Andrew Pitts
	Thomas Streicher

SUMMER SCHOOL

Inspired by the success of the graduate student preconference of CTCS'02 in
Ottawa, the CTCS of this year will have a similar event: A summer school
from August 9-11. The goal is to prepare students - both graduate and
undergraduate, with basic knowledge of category theory - for CTCS, through
mini-courses in the basic areas underlying some of the fields of the
conference. We anticipate offering courses in among others the following
areas:

Coalgebras
Game Semantics
Categorical Models for Concurrency
Operational Semantics in Concurrency

There will be a two week workshop, June 7 - 18, 2004, on
the topic:

n-Categories: Foundations and Applications.

This is the 2004 Summer Program of the Institute for
Mathematics and its Applications, at the University
of Minnesota. Further information may be found at:

http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories

Our main goal is to make progress in sorting out the basic
foundational issues concerning definitions of "weak n-category",
but the main areas of current and potential application will
also be discussed.  We have generous but limited funding from
the IMA, and we have applied to the NSF for supplemental funding.
Those interested are invited to register on-line at:

http://www.ima.umn.edu/docs/reg_form1.html

We will do the best that we can to find (partial) support.
Graduate students and postdocs who are seriously interested in
learning about this subject and who have some background in
category theory and/or categorical homotopy theory are especially
invited to register.

John Baez and Peter May

development directed to the specialist should follow. References and
comparisons with related work should be included.  Extended abstracts
may be no longer than 10 pages including references, and must be
formatted in the IEEE Proceedings two-column camera-ready style (IEEE
style files will be accessible from the LICS website).  If necessary,
detailed proofs of technical results can be included in a
clearly-labelled appendix in the same two-column format following the
10-page extended abstract. This material may be read at the discretion
of the program committee.  Extended abstracts not conforming to the
above requirements concerning format and length may be rejected
without further consideration.  The results must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of
other symposia or workshops.  All authors of accepted papers will be
expected to sign copyright release forms.  One author of each accepted
paper will be expected to present it at the conference.


Short Presentations:
LICS 2004 will have a session of short (5--10 minutes) presentations.
This session is intended for descriptions of work in progress, student
projects, and relevant research being published elsewhere; other brief
communications may be acceptable. Submissions for these presentations,
in the form of short abstracts (1 or 2 pages long), should be entered
at the LICS 2004 submission site between March 27th and April 4th,
2004.  Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by April
17th, 2004.


Kleene Award for Best Student Paper:
An award in honor of the late S.C. Kleene will be given for the best
student paper, as judged by the program committee.  For a submission
to be eligible, the research presented in the paper must have been
carried out while all authors were full-time students.  The program
committee may decline to make the award or may split it among several
papers.

Affiliated Workshops:
As in previous years, there will be a number of workshops affiliated
with LICS 2004; information will be posted at the LICS website.

The following may be of interest to readers of this list:

Carsten F=FChrmann and David Pym,
''On the Geometry of Interaction for Classical Logic''.

Abstract. It is well-known that weakening and contraction cause na=EFve
categorical models of the classical sequent calculus to collapse to
Boolean lattices. In a previous paper, summarized herein, we provided
sound and complete models that avoid this collapse by interpreting
cut-reduction by a partial order between morphisms. In this article, we
provide concrete examples of such models, based on geometry of
interaction and data-flow. Our models provide detailed analyses of the
relationships between negation, weakening, and contraction under
cut-reduction.

We'd be very pleased to receive comments. This paper follows on from

Carsten F=FChrmann and David Pym,
"Order-enriched Categorical Models of the Classical Sequent Calculus".

Abstract. It is well-known that weakening and contraction cause na=EFve
categorical models of the classical sequent calculus to collapse to
Boolean lattices. Starting from a convenient formulation of the
well-known categorical semantics of linear classical sequent proofs, we
give models of weakening and contraction that do not collapse.
Cut-reduction is interpreted by a partial order between morphisms. Our
models make no commitment to any translation of classical logic into
intuitionistic logic and distinguish non-deterministic choices of
cut-elimination. We show soundness and completeness via initial models
built from proof nets, and describe models built from sets and relations.

This paper is in submission. Manscript available at

Again, we'd be very pleased to receive comments.

Regards,

    David
