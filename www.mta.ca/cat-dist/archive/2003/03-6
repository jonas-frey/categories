Is this a failure of constructivism as such, or just a bug?
No doubt that a coherent philosophy of mathematics
helps to avoid such mistakes, but would anybody ever claim
that it's *not* a mistake?

Nerode, Shore: logic for Applications, Springer, has detailed tableau
development for intuitionistic, and modal logics: i.e. there is
nothing intrinsically classical about the method. The ideas go back to
Hintikka and Beth (at least) in the 1950s and 60s.

At least in the book "Elemente der Kategorientheorie" by D. Pumpl\"un
the above characterization of natural maps is used explicitely; there is
also a short discussion on obtaining simpler proofs this way.

For the above reason \circ is used for the "horizontal composition";
\cdot or \ast (I do not remember which one) is used for the
"vertical composition", which after all looks more "point-wise".

Unfortunately some authors use these symbols just the other way round.

My two cents worth:

John Harrison (the creator of HOL Light) has a very coherent, but
pragmatic philosophy of mathematics. Let us see how much can we do with
constructive logic, without getting rid of the classical principles: Add
them at the end, so that if someone really needs it, they can use it. This
is a philosophy quite widespread in Cambridge, with Peter Johnstone's
books being the paradigmatic example. If classical reasoning is needed,
it's used, but flagged.

I also agree with Till that it's a cute example.

Best,
Valeria

I did not want to deny the need of mathematical thought, but I found this example of topos theory emerging unexpectedly quite pleasing.

Note that the mail is *not* about Isabelle. Admittedly, I do not know anything about the quoted system HOL light, so I have not verified Slind's claim.

The reason why I suggested that the Law of Excluded
Middle is required is that reductio ad absurbdum is
the core concept in Tableaux or to put it another way
Tableaux is built around bivalent logic.

Isabelle's internal logic comes from Lambek and Scott.  It is an
instance of Example 1.1 on page 132, where all types are assumed to be
non-empty.  However, even their full system is unacceptable to many
constructivists because it is impredicative.  Constructive theories,
like a certain commuting diagrams package, have a surprising tendency
to "time out".

It is also possible to use a 2-dimensional syntax, in which horizontal
composition is composed horizontally and vertical composition is
composed vertically. Then algebraic manipulations are a bit like sliding
tiles around in a tray.

But this is the heart of the matter.  There is a certain precise sense
in which what happens in a topos between the empty set and a singleton
set governs the behavior of the rest of the topos.  Instead, why not
factor out the topos logic and add whatever nonemptiness assumptions
that are perceived necessary from a practical standpoint as an
additional theory?  This factoring shouldn't affect those that rely on
the non-emptiness assumptions, but it would make a big difference to
those who want to work in the topos logic.

SCOPE AND TOPICS

    Modern  information  systems  rely  more  and  more  on  combining
    concurrent, distributed, mobile and heterogenous components.  This
    move from  old systems, typically conceived  in isolation, induces
    the  need  for  new   languages  and  software  architectures.  In
    particular, coordination  languages have been  proposed to cleanly
    separate  computational aspects  and communication.  On  the other
    hand,  software  architects face  the  problem  of specifying  and
    reasoning  on non-functional requirements.   All these  issues are
    widely perceived as  fundamental to improve software productivity,
    enhance maintainability, advocate modularity, promote reusability,
    and  lead   to  systems  more  tractable  and   more  amenable  to
    verification and global analysis.

    The aim of  the workshop is to bring  together researchers working
    on the foundations of component-based computing, coordination, and
    software architectures.  Topics of  interest include (but  are not
    limited to):

    o  Theoretical models  for  coordination (component  composition,
       concurrency,   dynamic  aspects  of   coordination,  semantics,
       expressiveness);
    o  Specification,  refinement, and  analysis  of software  archi-
       tectures (patterns  and styles, verification  of functional and
       non-functional properties);
    o  Coordination, architectural, and interface description languages
       (implementation, interoperability, heterogeneity);
    o  Agent-oriented languages (formal models for interacting agents);
    o  Dynamic  software architectures (mobile  agents, configuration,
       reconfiguration);
    o  Modeling  of  information  systems (groupware,  internet  and
       the web, workflow management, CSCW and multimedia applications)
    o  Coordination patterns (mobile computing, internet computing);
    o  Tools  and environments  for  the  development of  coordinated
       applications
    o  Methodologies for validating and certifying software compositions

I don't know Isabelle too well BUT in Higher Order Logic one may
well assume inhabitedness of all types when these are built up from
N (and 1) via x,-> and P(-). In higher order logic one cannot form
subtypes in the logical sense and that's the only way how one can
build types that aren't inhabited.
Of course, even if type sigma is inhabited from

    (1)   \forall x:\sigma. A(x)->B

one must not conclude

    (2)   \exists x:\sigma. A(x) /\ B

BUT only

    (3)  \exists x:\sigma. A(x) -> B

BTW concluding (2) from (1) is false also classically.

The point of my message is merely to counter suggestions on this
mailing list that Isabelle's underlying logic was cooked up in some
ad-hoc way and is incoherent.  The basic logic comes from a standard
source.  Extensions (type classes especially) were thought through very
carefully.  We have never claimed allegiance to any school of
constructivity.

Of course this can be done using big diagrams.
But is there a tight syntax for this just using text?
Can you point to an example? (preferably a TeX source online,
but a printed page in a regular journal would also work).

Did anybody apply the theory of categories to gene alignment problem?
If you have 2 sequences then the alignment is a morfism. My impression is
that many problems in genomic alignment can be formulated using
the language of category theory (e.g., product = intersection of 2 alignments,
coproduct = combining several alignments).

If somebody knows any reference or interested in collaboration, please
contact me.

That may be the only way that one can *construct* such a type,
hence the only way that one can *prove* that such a type exists,
but how do you know that some unspecified type variable \sigma
doesn't refer to an uninhabited type to begin with?
The answer will depend on the interpretation, I suppose;
some logics simply aren't applicable to some semantics.

Of course.  Only with \exists x:\sigma. A(x) will (2) follow.

For function composition, I just use the standard small circle \circ. So the
function composite of natural transformations \tau and \sigma (if it exists)
is \tau\circ\sigma. It is advisable to give up subscripting as a way of
denoting values of (fully extended) natural transformations: The value of \tau at
morphism a is just \tau(a). I would not use juxtaposition or any other generic
means (e.g., a centered dot) of denoting composition in a general category for
function composition or, for that matter, for any other composition which
already has a specified composition symbol, but I do denote pointwise ("vertical")
composition generically. Here is an example of how this goes---a line proof of
the interchange law for function and pointwise composition:

{\noindent\bf Proposition (Interchange Law):} When $\nu\mu\circ\tau\sigma$ is
defined for natural transformations $\nu$, $\mu$, $\tau$ and $\sigma$, then
so is $(\nu\circ\tau)\cdot(\mu\circ\sigma)$, and
$$\nu\mu\circ\tau\sigma=(\nu\circ\tau)\cdot(\mu\circ\sigma).$$
\medskip

{\noindent\bf Proof:} The void cases are trivial. Assume that
$\nu\mu\circ\tau\sigma$ is defined. Then surely $\nu\circ\tau$ and $\mu\circ\sigma$ are
defined, and
$$\dom(\nu\circ\tau)=\dom\nu\circ\dom\tau=\cod\mu\circ\cod\sigma=\cod(\mu\circ
\sigma),$$
so $\nu\circ\tau$ composes pointwise with $\mu\circ\sigma$. Calculate as
follows at an $a$ in the common domain category of both sides of the interchange
formula:
$$\eqalign{[(\nu\cdot\mu)\circ(\tau\cdot\sigma)](a)=&\nu[\tau(\cod
a)\cdot\sigma(a)]\cdot\mu(\dom[\tau(\cod a)\cdot\sigma(a)])\cr
&\cr
=&\nu(\tau(\cod a))\cdot(\dom\nu)[\sigma(a)]\cdot\mu[\dom\sigma(a)]\cr
&\cr
=&(\nu\circ\tau)(\cod a)\cdot(\cod\mu)[\sigma(a)]\cdot\mu[\dom\sigma(a)]\cr
&\cr
=&(\nu\circ\tau)(\cod a)\cdot\mu(\sigma(a))\cr
&\cr
=&(\nu\circ\tau)(\cod a)\cdot(\mu\circ\sigma)(a)\cr
&\cr
=&[(\nu\circ\tau)\cdot(\mu\circ\sigma)](a).\cr}$$
So the two sides of the interchange equation have the same intertwining
function.
Checking domain functors,
$$\eqalign{\dom(\nu\mu\circ\tau\sigma)&=\dom\nu\mu\circ\dom\tau\sigma\cr
&=\dom\mu\circ\dom\sigma\cr
&=\dom(\mu\circ\sigma)\cr
&=\dom(\nu\circ\tau)(\mu\circ\sigma);\cr}$$
similarly, $\cod(\nu\mu\circ\tau\sigma)=\cod(\nu\circ\tau)(\mu\circ\sigma)$.
Thus the two natural transformations are equal.

In this, \dom and \cod are defined by
\def\dom {\hbox{\rm dom }}
\def\cod {\hbox{\rm cod }}
and respectively represent the domain and the codomain function on the
implicit category. The proof uses the following formulas for pointwise composition
in terms of fully extended natural transformations (i.e.,  in terms of their
intertwining functions \pi and \tau):
(\pi\cdot\tau)(a)=\pi(a)\cdot\tau(\dom a)=\pi(\cod a)\cdot\tau(a)
which I can't help mentioning as an aside shows that evaluation of fully
extended natural transformations at a morphism intertwines evaluation at its
domain object with evaluation at its codomain object. (And, incidentally, codomains
are on the left in my notations, domains on the right.)

If I haven't explained something necessary here, I hope that you can
nevertheless see that the above line proof represents a moderately massive amount of
diagram drawing and chasing and would fit convincingly on the page of a
textbook. I hope that this addresses your request. The only examples which I know are
all in my personal set of notes which I set up PCTex32 over the last dozen
years and which come out at about 200 pages. This is probably a little too much
to drop on you all at once. I am, however, anxious to answer any further
questions which you may have.

It may be useful to recall the Ehresmann method of setting up the
exponential law for categories using the double categoy of commuting
squares in a category. This is also written up in

 (R.Brown,  P. NICKOLAS), ``Exponential laws for topological
categories,  groupoids and groups and mapping spaces of
colimits'', {\em Cah. Top. G\'eom.  Diff.} 20 (1979) 179-198.

The nice point is that the category structure is induced by a double
category composition, and so if you have extra structure, such as a
topology, that carries over.

Dear All,

In reply to Toby Bartels, there are various models of higher categories
in which the syntax is well attested and the `sliding of tiles' is
algebraically described.  One possible one that extends to arbitrary
dimensions is given in the paper:


        AL-AGL, A.A., BROWN, R. & STEINER, R., Multiple categories: the
        equivalence of a globular and a cubical approach, Advances in
        Math. 170 (2002) 71-118.

The links between `cubical' syntax and a more globular syntax are at the
heart of the extensive work on the equivalence between the various
models for weak n-categories. One problem is that there are no normal
forms for elements. In fact I think (possibly!) that the problem of
rewriting in these higher dimensional settings needs a higher
dimensional rewriting systems, and to model that one needs n-cateories
(and so on!)

Dear all,


Let C be an omega-category (strict, globular).

Let U be the forgetful functor from strict globular omega-categories
to globular sets. And let F be its left adjoint.

Let us suppose that we are considering an equivalence relation R on UC
(the underlying globular set of C) such that the source and target
maps pass to the quotient : i.e. one can deal with the quotient globular
set UC/R.

The canonical morphism of globular sets UC --> UC/R induces a morphism
of omega-categories F(UC) --> F(UC/R) by functoriality of F.

Consider the following push-out in the category of omega-categories :


F(UC) ----->  F(UC/R)
  |               |
  |               |
  |               |
  v               v
  C   --------->  D


The morphism F(UC)-->C (the counit of the adjonction) is surjective on
the underlying sets.

The morphism F(UC)-->F(UC/R) is generally not surjective on the
underlying sets : because by taking the quotient by R, one may add
composites in F(UC/R) which do not exist in F(UC).

However the intuition tells (me) that the morphism F(UC/R)-->D is
surjective on the underlying sets : this morphism only adds in F(UC/R)
the calculation rules of C : this is precisely what I want by
introducing D. But I cannot see why with a rigorous mathematical
argument.


Thanks in advance. pg.

Certainly, if you allow type variables then the problem crops up. I don't
really see the point why one would like to have type variables unless one
can perform constructions with types in a uniform way, e.g. when considering
logic on top of system F, system F\omega or even on top of a dependent type
theory (possibly with an impredicative universe). I guess that in case of HOL
type variables were rather motivated by the analogy to functional languages
with their "shallow" polymorphism.
The point of my mail rather was that so-called topos logic admits subtype
formation, i.e. that {x:A|phi(x)} is a type whenever \phi is a predicate on A.
This, of course, allows one to introduce types with undecided inhabitedness.
See W.Phoa's Edinburgh lecture notes for a calculus extending HOL with subtypes
(or Bart Jacob's book).
But I would be surprised if HOL has subtype formation as from a logical
point of view subtypes are neither necessary nor convenient. Adding subtypes
is only necessary for getting a topos out of a model of HOL.

Dear Colleagues,

The paper, "Order-enriched categorical models of the
classical sequent calculus", by Carsten F=FChrmann and
David Pym, may be of interest to readers of the recipient
lists. It is available at

=09http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~pym/oecm.pdf

Abstract. It is well-known that weakening and contraction cause na=EFve
categorical models of the classical sequent calculus to collapse to
Boolean lattices. Starting from a convenient formulation of the
well-known categorical semantics of linear classical sequent proofs, we
give models of weakening and contraction that do not collapse.
Cut-reduction is interpreted by a partial order between morphisms. Our
models make no commitment to any translation of classical logic into
intuitionistic logic and distinguish non-deterministic choices of
cut-elimination. We show soundness and completeness via initial models
built from proof nets, and describe models built from sets and relations.

Please accept out apologies for the size (11.5 Mb) of the pdf file: the
proof-net diagrams are rather complex.

Kind regards,

=09David Pym

Hello,

   Questions concerning:
http://www.lfcs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/reports/92/ECS-LFCS-92-208/

   I am familiar with natural deduction and
sequents. In the chapter on Toposes (Chapter 3), I
have some questions about the very beginning where
propositional calculus (intuitionistic) is discussed

1) Did he leave out the Elimination rule for V? I do
see in the second line on far right a rule for V, but
it doesn't look like EV???

2) I don't understand the Structual rules. Can anybody
give me a short explanation?

 Regards, Bill Halchin

This may be `mere' pedagogy for ordinary categories, but if you try the
same thing for 2-categories then it becomes a `genuine' issue.  To put it
another way, the two different but equivalent presentations of a concept
(natural transformation) become, on categorification, significantly
different.

First the 1-dimensional situation.  As I understand it, Pat Donaly's
original point was that given functors

    F, G: C ---> D

between categories, you can either define a natural transformation in the
standard way (assigning an arrow of D to each object of C) or in an
alternative way (assigning an arrow of D to each arrow of C).  With the
standard method, vertical composition of transformations is "easy" to
define, and horizontal composition is "hard".  With the alternative
method, horizontal composition is now easy to define (as Pat noted), but
vertical composition is "hard".  So the situation is reversed.

Of course, neither of these "hard"s is really hard, but in both cases you
have two evident ways of defining a composite - one left-handed, one
right-handed - and if you're going to do anything whatsoever with the
definition then you need to show that these two ways give exactly the same
result.

Now suppose that C and D are 2-categories and F and G are 2-functors.  It
doesn't matter whether C, D, F and G are strict or weak for the purposes
of this discussion.  Suppose we're interested in defining weak (=pseudo)
transformations F ---> G.  The usual way is to say that such a
transformation consists of a 1-cell

   alpha_c : Fc ---> Gc

for each c in C, together with an invertible 2-cell inside each naturality
square, satisfying axioms.  With this definition, vertical composition of
transformations is easy to define (and there's only one evident way of
doing it), but horizontal composition can be defined in two different
ways, which are not equal but canonically isomorphic.  An alternative
approach is to say that a transformation consists of a 1-cell

   alpha_f: Fc ---> Gc'

for each 1-cell

   f: c ---> c'

in C, together with certain further 2-cells, satisfying axioms.  You can
guess the rest of this paragraph: with this definition, horizontal
composition is now easily (and canonically) defined, but vertical
composition can be defined in two different ways, which are not equal but
canonically isomorphic.

You might think that this isn't a genuine difference or "problem" so far,
because everything is the same up to isomorphism.  But now suppose that
you're interested in *lax* transformations F ---> G (where F and G are
still 2-functors, as above).  The usual definition is that such a lax
transformation alpha consists of a 1-cell alpha_c as above for each object
c of C, and then a not-necessarily-invertible 2-cell inside each
naturality square (pointing in a direction fixed by convention),
satisfying axioms.  These lax transformations can still be composed
vertically perfectly easily, but horizontal composition is now
*impossible* to define.  (More accurately, you can define two different
horizontal compositions, but they're not isomorphic, only connected by a
non-invertible cell; you could of course choose one over the other, but it
won't have good properties.)  And if you define "lax transformation"
according to the alternative method, then horizontal composition is now
easy and vertical composition impossible.

In summary, if you define transformation of 1- or 2-category in the
standard style then vertical composition is always easy, and regarding
horizontal composition:

- for transformations of categories, it's canonically defined
- for weak transformations of 2-categories, it's not canonically defined
  (you have to choose "left" or "right"), but is canonically defined up to
  isomorphism
- for lax transformations of 2-categories, it's not defined at all.

If you use the alternative style then the situation is similar but with
"vertical" and "horizontal" reversed.

Puzzling.

Tom

Hi Paul,

> "The neglect of sum types is the root of all evil."

To some extent this may be true for programming languages (but see recent
work of Jim Laird). For logics it is less clear. Actually you mean the
empty type, isn't it? Moreover, sunset types are slightly heavier than
ordinary sum types. Subset types are rather dependent sum types.

                           Call for Papers

              Compositional Verification of UML Models
                Workshop of the UML 2003 Conference


The definition  of UML has been  motivated by the need  for a standard
notation  for   modelling  system  architectures   and  behaviours  at
functional  and  implementation  level.   The  main  fqocus  has  been
essentially  on terminology,  notation and  syntax  without addressing
semantic, validation  and methodology  issues which are  important for
formal design and verification techniques. This workshop addresses the
application  of  formal  methods   and  techniques  that  exploit  the
architectural  structure  of UML  models  in  a compositional  manner.

TOPICS
The  workshop topics  include  (but  are  not limited  to):
* semantic  foundations  of  architectural  and component-based  design
within UML
* compositional techniques  for the analysis  embedded and real-time
systems  in  UML
* compositional model  checking  of  UML behavioural models
* compositional deductive  methods based on  OCL
* methodologies based on compositional formal techniques

FORMAT OF THE WORKSHOP
The  workshop will consist  of presentations  of the  accepted papers,
which will  be the basis for  an intensive discussion  on the workshop
topics.   Extended abstracts  of the  presentations will  be published
after the workshop  by Elsevier Science as a  volume of the Electronic
Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.

For an up-to-date program and  invited talks see the workshop web-site
http://fmco.liacs.nl/compuml.html

SUBMISSIONS
Authors are invited to submit  by August 25th an extended abstract not
exceeding 20  pages electronically to  F.S.de.Boer@cwi.nl. Submissions
must be either  in Postscript or PDF format  and prepared for USLetter
or A4 page sizes.

Submissions will  be evaluated by the program  committee for inclusion
in the  proceedings, which  will be published  by Electronic  Notes in
Theoretical  Computer  Science series.  Papers  must contain  original
contributions, be  clearly written, and  include appropriate reference
to and comparison with related work. Simultaneous submissions to other
conferences are not allowed.

the point is that tableau calculus may be best understood as a search for
cut-free proofs in either classical or intuitionistic logic; this fact is
systematically overlooked in the literature on tableaux methods like in the
logic programming community one hardly ever finds exposed the view that
executing a logic program is nothing but unravelling an inductive definition

for information on tableau methods from a proof-theoretic point of view see
Troelstra & van Dalen's book "Constructivism in Mathematics" vol.2, the chapter
on proof theory of intuitionistic logic

   But I would be surprised if HOL has subtype formation as from a logical
   point of view subtypes are neither necessary nor convenient. Adding subtypes
   is only necessary for getting a topos out of a model of HOL.

I don't know, if I miss the point here. However, PVS has a HOL
system with predicate subtypes. And it is _very very_ convenient
(because of the predicate subtypes).

I don't know if it is a necessity, but the absence of subtypes in
Isabelle/HOL leads to a representation of partial functions, that
allows you to prove unexpected results. Despite what the Isabelle
tutorial says at page 187, you _can_ prove

  hd [] = last []

(saying that the head of the empy list equals its last element)

Hendrik

To all category theorists,

I'm looking for a reference to the definition of a normal categorical
subgroup, i.e. the right kind of subgroupoid of a categorical group for
taking the quotient. I know the definition, but I have no reference. Does
anyone know a published origin of the definition?

Best wishes,

Marco Mackaay

Hello!
 First here are some preprints that relate delooping in topology to the
functor described by enriching over a monoidal category:

 http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0304026  Enrichment as Categorical Delooping I: Enrichment Over Iterated Monoidal Categories

  http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0306086 Higher Dimensional Enrichment

In continuing this research my collaborator and I have become interested
in extending results to V-modules (with hope of an explicit categorical
looping given by taking endofunctors becoming clear.) I notice in the
literature that there are two definitions of a V-module. Less common is a
definition that corresponds more closely to a classical module. This is
described as a category with a left (right) functorial action of V. Here
V-module functors and natural transformations are easily defined as well
(forming a 2-category Mod_V?) For instance, for c an object in C a
V-module, v in V, then a V-mod-functor F:C->D repects the action: F(vc) =
vF(c). V itself is a V-module in this sense, and End(V) = V seems to hold.
It also looks as though for V braided, left V-modules have a canonical
right structure, perhaps leading to a tensor product of V-V-bimodules. Any
references on this?
 The second definition is more common: for V closed, braided, a V-module
is a V-functor F:B^op tensor A -> V. These form the one-cells in a
bicategory V-Mod (objects V-categories, two-cells V-nat.trans.). Here
(given enough structure) we recover V as V-Mod(1,1) where 1 is the unit
V-category |1| ={0} and 1(0,0) = I the unit object of V. I noticed that
there may be a way to describe categories of these (Street's) V-modules as
(classical) V-modules. Modulo some careful checking, V-Mod(A,B) has an
action of V given by (vF)(A,B) = v tensor F(A,B). The details of this
action on morphisms require the adjunction that makes V closed.
 Is there some well-known deep connection between the two concepts that I
have missed due to my youth and naivete? We would be thankful for any
helpful comments or suggested references. Thanks,

 Stefan Forcey

Hello,

   This is a followup question to my other question
about topoi and intuistionistic logic. On page 350,
Lawvere is talking about logical operations (in
a Heyting algebra I think??). In particular I
having trouble understanding the narrative on the
implication operation "=>" in the sense
1) I don't understand what <alpha, beta>. (e.g.
      is alpha meant to be an
      element: alpha:1->omega?)

2) also what alpha "subset" beta is!


 Please help me.

Thanks and regards, Bill Halchin

thanks for the interesting information; you really pinpoint why subtypes
are used in practice, namely for avoiding partial functions; if one wants
to avoid subtypes and treat partial functions directly one might use the
Fourman/Scott variant of the interpretation of topos logic; an alternative
and actually the one common in mathematical practice is to introduce subtypes;
however, to do this constructively one is forced to either treat partial functions
as single-valued realtions OR to explicitly introduce proof objects as in Martin-Loef
type theory; I am pretty certain that in systems like HA_\omega one cannot quantify
over partial functions as these subsume prediacte types;
but if one has Higher Order Logic already it seems more natural to treat partial functions
as single valued relations; quantification over subtypes can then be reduced to pure Higher
Order Logic via a straightforward translation (which, however, needs some care as one sees
from HOL)

Thomas

Tom---I understand your general point to be that 2-categories are different,
and from this I tentatively suspect that you would not favor my habit of
calling "horizontal" composition function composition if that proposition were
before the board. I have to give the particulars of this some thought, but while I
am thinking, I'm going to wish that you had been aware of my perspective on
2-categories when you made your comment. What follows is a failed attempt to
convey this perspective in a reasonably brief email in hopes that you will
kindly make some additional comments with this background in view. Reading this
will require some patience, because my lack of erudition is going to show up
here, but let me state that the objective is to define a general natural
transformation to be a functor into a cell category which is actually the first
participating category in a certain type of split interchange category, then to
define its arithmetic in these terms. This is an extremely general but surely not
unprecedented definition of naturality which provides a correspondingly general
definition of "vertical" or (as I prefer) pointwise composition without any
conflicts which I can see, although it is true that function composition does
not seem to exist in this generality. Your sharpest criticisms are very
welcome.

To begin, everyone knows that a double category is an ordered pair of
participating categories which have the same underlying set (of morphisms), and a
double functor is a function between underlying sets which is functorial between
first participants and also between second participants. Say that a double
category splits if the domain and codomain function of each of these participants
is endofunctorial on the other participant. First fact: In this case, the set
of objects of each participant forms a subcategory of the other
participant---call it the object subcategory of the other participant and be careful to
distinguish it from the subcategory of objects which any category has. My excuse
for using "split" in this context is that a category participates with itself
in a split double category exactly when it is a disjoint union of monoids.
Everyone also knows the interchange law for double categories: The compositions
of the participants commute with each other in the weak sense that $ab\#
cd=(a\#c)(b\#d)$ if both sides are defined (visible composition symbols are used as
delimiters in the obvious fashion). Say that a double category is a split
interchange category if it splits and satisfies this interchange law. To be brief,
call it a splintor.

A category participates in a splintor with itself exactly when it is
synonymously its own reverse, opposite or dual category, which amounts to being the
disjoint union of a set of commutative monoids. Call it a core splintor, because
every splintor contains a strongly maximal core subsplintor whose underlying
set consists of those elements at which all four object (i.e., domain and
codomain) functions agree, so that the double objects are obviously in the core.
Strongly maximal means that any core splintor which is a subsplintor of the
given splintor is contained in its core. (Incidentally, aside from core
splintors, I know of only one general type of splintor which has a nondiscrete
core---namely splintors of classical natural transformations under pointwise and
function composition. In fact, in this example, the core consists of those natural
transformations which intertwine identity functors. If an identity functor is
the identity functor of a monoid, the natural transformations which intertwine
it with itself is isomorphic to the classical monoidal center by evaluation
at the monoid's object, and from this I have picked up the habit of saying that
a core component monoid is the center of its object.)

There are a couple of other ways to come across splintors. The easiest is to
just strip off the composition of a category---this gives the discrete, say,
first participant of a splintor for which the second participant is just the
given category itself, so that every category participates in a splintor of some
kind. Call such a splintor a stripping splintor or strippor for short. As in
the case of core categories, every subsplintor of a strippor is a strippor,
and every splintor contains a strippor which is strongly maximal as a contained
strippor: This strippor is just the discrete subcategory of objects of the
first participant and the object subcategory of the second participant. I call
the originally given splintor an objectification of this latter object
subcategory, since it amounts to a way of converting the morphisms of the object
subcategory into the objects of the first participant.

Objectifications are good, because they give a systematic way of converting
the objectified category into a category of functors under function
composition, thus generalizing the Cayley Representation Theorem for groups in a fairly
grandiose manner. This would not lead anyone to think that there would be any
point to objectifying a category which is already discrete, but such
objectifications are precisely the splintors whose second participant's objects are the
splintor double objects. Because of the endofunctoriality of the second
participant's object functions, the homsets of the second participant are
subcategories of the first participant, and bicomposition---simultaneously composing on
the left by one morphism and on the right by another---defines a homset
structuring bifunctor. For this reason, I call objectifications of discrete
categories structuring categories or just structors. This will disgust you, because
structors are what everyone else calls 2-categories. At any rate, every
subsplintor of a structor is a structor, and every splintor contains a structor which
is strongly maximal in the splintor vis-a-vis being a structor. Core
categories and strippors are structors. For that matter, so is a strict monoidal
category, which is just a splintor whose second participant (say) is a monoid.

Here is the crucial property as far as "vertical" or pointwise composition of
natural transformations is concerned. One knows that the functions from a set
into the underlying set of a category have a categorical pointwise
composition: (fg)(xy)=f(x)g(y) when the right side is always defined. So fix a category
and a splintor and consider the functors from the category into the splintor's
first participant. The underlying functions of these functors are stable
under pointwise composition in the second participant, and thus the functors
themselves may be said to form a category under pointwise composition in that
second participant. This is why the homomorphisms from a group into a commutative
group form a group under pointwise composition---because the commutative group
participates in a core splintor with itself. I would almost be willing to say
that a hypergeneral natural transformation is a functor into a splintor first
participant just because you get one of the primary operations of the
arithmetic in this way, but I realistically know that this much generality isn't going
to go far in terms of my talents; so there is a need for more specialized
splintors which more visibly include the classical natural transformation
concept.

This strong market for splintors of various sorts necessitates a more
categorical phrasing of the standard banalities on transitive relations. Given a set
X, define transition composition on its self-cartesian product by
(a,b)(b,c)=(a,c). Any subcategory of this is a transition category on X; the whole thing
is the full transition category X* on X. A transition category is a transitive
relation if it is reflexive in this full transition category; i.e., it has the
same objects. The term "preorder" is dropped. A transitive relation is an
equivalence relation if it is its own subcategory of isomorphisms; it is a
partial ordering if this subcategory is discrete. A function h:X->Y defines a
functor h* between full transition categories by slotwise evaluation: h*(a,
b)=(h(a),h(b)). Every functor between transitive relations is obtained by restricting
and narrowing some such h*. Every equivalence relation is the kernel of some
h*, meaning that it is the inverse image of the discrete subcategory of objects
of the codomain category of h*.

This said, the full transition category of the underlying set of a category
participates with the self-product of the category in a splintor. A subsplintor
for which the first participant is a transitive relation on this underlying
set is a stable transitive relation on the given category. So a partially
ordered group is a splintor. Also interesting is the product category whose first
component is the said full transition category and whose second component is
the said self-product, since it contains various subcategories of "commutative
squares", where I use quotes because I may be referring to commuting to within
an isomorphism or to within an inequality or, generally, to within a morphism
of some specified category which I'll call the value category. I'm now pretty
close to the ideas of a cell category and a cell splintor.

These are splintor concepts. Begin with an objectification (B,C) of the
category A (with composition \# on C and hence on A) whose quasi-commutative
squares are to be constructed. Form the product category A*\times(A\times A), where
A* is the full transition category of the underlying set of A. Take the value
category B to be the first participant of the given objectification, and form
the set [A*\times(A\times A)]\times B, showing no interest in its cartesian
product composition, because there is a subset S of it which has a more
interesting cell composition. To bring this out, write the quintuples in
[A*\times(A\times A)]\times B in attachment form, so that a member looks like (q,u,b,v,p)
with b in B, (u,v) in A\times A and the transition (q,p) in A*. In this, (
q,u,v,p) is the square (of A-morphisms) which is to be regarded as commuting to
within the morphism b. So S consists of those quintuples for which q\# u and v\#
p are defined in A, while b is in the homset of B-morphisms from v\# p to q\#
u, and domains and codomains are organized as follows: The domain of b in C is
the domain of p in C which is also the domain of u in C, while the codomain
of b in C is the codomain in C of q and also the codomain in C of v. These
quintuples are the cells of (B,C). The cell composite of a cell (r,s,c,t,q) with
cell (q,u,b,v,p) is the cell (r,s\#u,(c\#u)(t\#b),t\#v,p). The outside
components are just the composite of (r,s,t,q) with (q,u,v,p) in [A*\times(A\times A)]
when the members of this category are written as attached pairs. The middle
term, which involves one composition in B, is defined whenever the composite
(r,s,t,q)(q,u,v,p) is defined in [A*\times(A\times A)].

So this defines cell composition relative to an objectification. It is
categorical, and the projection (q,u,b,v,p)->(q,u,v,p) is injective when restricted
to the set of objects of S, thus has a subcategory of [A*\times(A\times A)] as
image, and this subcategory is reasonably called the category of squares
which commute to within a B-morphism.

Now I can say that a natural transformation (to within B) is a functor from
some category into the cell category S. To get the idea closer to the classical
form, you notice that following such a functor by the detaching functors
(q,u,b,v,p)->u and (q,u,b,v,p)->v gives candidates for the domain and codomain
functors (my domains are on the right, and codomains are on the left) of the
natural transformation, and, to get a fully extended intertwining function, follow
by (q,u,b,v,p)->b. This last map is functorial into B exactly when the given
splintor (B,C) is a structor (i.e., a 2-category), which is so if and only if
it is surjective. Both B and C have functorial representations in S in this
case, which is my personal, idiosyncratic explanation of why the elements of
2-categories are called cells.

To get pointwise composition out of this, you construct a second
participating cell category by first of all reversing B to get a splintor (B',C) which
still objectifies A. Then you construct the cell category of this semireversed
splintor and apply the double switch (q,u,b,v,p)->(v,p,b,q,u) to pull the
semireverse cell composition back onto the underlying set of the first cell category
S. This gives the second participant T of the the cell splintor (S,T) of
(B,C). Pointwise composition of natural transformations means pointwise
composition of functors into S in T. By the way, (S,T) is a structor exactly when the
objectified category A is discrete, which reflects the fact that forming a cell
splintor does not change (except by a functorial isomorphism) a splintor's
maximal structor, nor does the core change. This is my argument that structors
are not enough to fully describe the cell concept.

To get the classical idea of a natural transformation, begin with a discrete
value category B; that is, begin with the strippor of C, then regard the
natural transformation as running from A to C. This is justified by the fact that,
in this case, the cell category S is isomorphic to its commutation category by
the projection (q,u,b,v,p)->(q,u,v,p); so the intertwining function
(q,u,b,v,p)->b can just as well be written as (q,u,v,p)->qu=vp, and so on. When this
follows the functor version of a classical natural transformation, it gives the
fully extended intertwining function which I mentioned in my first email.

You can see that, as far as this point of view goes, there is no particularly
obvious conflict between function composition of natural transformations and
pointwise composition. Function composition doesn't obviously exist when
values are not discrete. There is presumably still plenty to be said in terms of
function composition of splintor functors, but I haven't thought about this at
all, and I'm not likely to start until I have understood your note.

Thanks for your comments and your patience if you have any left.

Though I have no reference for just the definition, I can make some
historical remarks which perhaps explain the absence of reference, and =
which
may be of interest for some people, and also give references for some =
(much
less obvious) developments of the subject concerning groupoids in the
category of manifolds and much more general ones.

About 1964 or 5, I had the opportunity of mentioning to Charles =
Ehresmann
that I had noticed the fact that the theory of factoring a group by a =
normal
(or invariant or distinguished) subgroup extends almost obviously to =
groupoids.
I was very surprised with his answer : "The question of quotients is a =
very
difficult one which I have solved recently and a part of the theory will =
be
proposed as the subject of examination for my students of DEA. I really
don't know how you could manage". It is likely that this was a polite =
way of
suggesting that I was certainly wrong in his opinion, but he didn't want =
to
listen more explanation.
Sometimes later, reading chapter III of his book on categories =
(published in
1965), I realized that he was certainly alluding to his very general =
theory of
factoring a category by an equivalence relation or by a subcategory, =
while satisfying a universal property. Though
this theory looks rather exhaustive and contains some rather deep and
sophisticated statements, it seems in my opinion strictly impossible to
deduce from any of these statements the very simple case of groupoids =
and
normal subgroupoids nor even the very definition of a normal =
subgroupoid.
I just recall here briefly what has certainly been discovered (at least =
partially) by any people
having had the opportunity of meeting the question and thinking ten =
minutes
to it, to know that the case of groups can be exactly mimicked for =
groupoids with
just two precautions :
-first, of course, expressions such as xHy have to be understood as =
denoting
all the composites of the form xhy which are defined (where h runs in H) =
;
as a consequence the condition of normality for H in G (in which y is =
the inverse of x) bears only on the
isotropy groups of H;
-secund and more significantly it is no more true in general that the =
right and left
cosets xH and Hx coincide ; however one just has to define the elements =
of the factor
groupoid as consisting of two-sided cosets HxH ; with this slight =
modification of the
theory, everything becomes an obvious exercise.
One has also to notice that there is a special case where no =
modification is
required, to know the case when H is actually a subgroup, i.e. just =
reduced
to its isotropy groups. In that case the base of the factor groupoid is =
not
changed. This case is the most obvious and also probably the best known =
(and
possibly for most people the only one known), but  in my opinion =
certainly
not the most interesting, since it does not include the quotient of a =
set by an equivalence relation, whose graph is viewed as a subgroupoid =
of a coarse groupoid.

Now what I really had in mind was not the purely algebraic (rather =
obvious)
setting, but the study of quotients for the differentiable groupoids
(nowadays called smooth or Lie) introduced by Ehresmann in 1959, which =
are
groupoids in the category of manifolds.
The statement I had obtained (which again certainly cannot by any means =
be
deduced from the general results of Ehresmann concerning topological or
structured groupoids) was published in 1966 in my Note (prealably =
submitted to Ehresmann and transmitted by him) :

-Th=E9orie de Lie pour les groupo=EFdes diff=E9rentiables. Relations =
entre
propri=E9t=E9s locales et globales, CRAS (Paris), s=E9rie A, t.263, =
p.907-910, 19
d=E9cembre 1966-

in Th=E9or=E8me 5 (in this statement the Bourbaki term "subimmersion" is
improperly used and has to be understood in the more restricted =
acception
"submersion onto a submanifold" ; note also that the implication from =
2=B0 to 1=B0 is valid only
when the fibres of the domain map of H are connected). (Note that in =
this statement the algebraic theory of the two-sided quotient of a =
groupoid by an invariant subgroupoid is implicitely considered as "well =
known" without reference. This was in fact a diplomatic consequence of =
the above-mentionned conversation ! At least at that period it seems =
absolutely certain that no reference did exist, and probably very few =
people, if any, had had the opportunity of thinking to that sort of =
questions, since the main stream of categoricists were despising =
groupoids as beig trivial, since equvalent to groups).
The unpublished proof of this statement relied on a careful and rather
delicate study of the foliation defined by the two-sided cosets.
The very elegant proof for the case of Lie groups given in Serre, Lie
Algebras and Lie Groups (lecture in Harvard, 1964, p.LG 4.10-11), =
relying on the so-called Godement's
theorem, works only for one-sided cosets and yields only the too special =
case
above-mentioned or more generally the statement of Proposition 2 in the
previous Note (which extends to groupoids the classical theory of =
homogeneous spaces for possibly non invariant subgroups).

It is clear that this last proof may be immediately written in a purely
diagrammatic way and remains valid in much more general contexts when an
abstract Godement's theorem is available. It turns out that this is the =
case
for most of (perhaps almost all)  the categories considered by "working
mathematicians", notably the abelian categories as well as toposes, the
category of topological spaces (with a huge lot of variants), the
category of Banach spaces, and many useful categories that are far from =
being complete.The precise definitions for what is meant by an abstract =
Godement's theorem were given in my paper :

-Building Categories in which a Godement's theorem is available-
published in the acts of the Second Colloque sur l'Alg=E8bre des =
Cat=E9gories,
Amiens 1975, Cahiers de Topologie....(CTGDC).

In this last paper I introduced the term "dyptique de Godement" for a
category in which one is given two subcategories of "good mono's" and =
"good
epi's" (playing the roles of embeddings and surmersions in Dif) such =
that a formal Godement's theorem is valid.

These considerations explain why I was strongly motivated for adapting
Serre's diagrammatic proof to the case of two-sided cosets (since such a =
proof would immediately extend the theory of quotients for groupoids in =
various non complete categories used by "working mathematicians", =
yielding a lot of theorems completely out of the range of Ehresmann's =
general theory of structured groupoids). However this was
achieved only in 1986 in my Note :

-Quotients de groupo=EFdes diff=E9rentiables, CRAS (Paris), t.303, =
S=E9rie I, 1986, p.817-820.-

The proof requires the use of certain "good cartesian squares" or "good =
pull back
squares", which, though they are not the most general pull back's =
existing
in the category Dif of manifolds, cannot be obtained by the (too
restrictive) classical condition of transversality. Though written in =
the
framework of the category Dif (in order not to frighten geometers, but =
with
the risk of frightening categoricists), this paper is clearly thought in
order to be easily generalizable in any category where a suitable set of
distinguished pull back's is available , assuming only some mild =
stability properties.

In this paper I introduced the seemingly natural term of "extensors" for
naming those functors between (structured) groupoids which arise from =
the
canonical projection of a groupoid onto its quotient by a normal
subgroupoid. Equivalent characterizations are given.(I am ignoring if =
another term is being used in the literature).This notion is resumed and =
used in my paper :

-Morphisms between spaces of leaves viewed as fractions-
CTGDC, vol.XXX-3 (1989),p. 229-246

which again is written in the smooth context, but using purely =
diagrammatic descriptions (notably for Morita equivalences and =
generalized morphisms) allowing immediate extensions for various =
categories.
As a prolongation of this last paper, I intend in future papers to give =
a
description of the category of fractions obtained by inverting those
extensors with connected fibres. This gives a weakened form of Morita
equivalence which seems basic for understanding the transverse structure =
of
foliations with singularities.

Just a few naive remarks about natural transformations and their two =
compositions.
I think comfortable to define natural transformations as functors, which =
is not the case, neither for the classical "object to arrow" nor for the =
"arrow to arrow" definition.
Now this can be achieved in two obviously equivalent ways.

In the following the letter I (though or because it is frequently used =
also to denote the unit interval) will picture the category denoted by 2 =
in CWM (just one arrow e going from the object 0 to the object 1) while =
QA will denote the category of commutative squares in the category A, =
endowed with the "horizontal" composition. (Note that the arrows of A =
may be described as functors from I to A and the arrows of QA as =
functors from the product category I x I to A).

Then the first definition is : a natural transformation between the =
categories A and B is nothing else than a functor from A to QB.=20
With this first definition, the vertical composition of natural =
transformations comes immediately from the "vertical" composition in QB =
(which is indeed a double category).

The secund definition (which is just a more symmetric reformulation of =
the "arrow to arrow" definition) seems to be less popular, though very =
useful in my opinion : a natural transformation between the categories A =
and B is also nothing else than a functor from the product category I x =
A to B.=20
This can also may be viewed as a functor from I x A to I x B, letting =
the first component be just the canonical projection from I x A to I.
Then the horizontal composition is just the composition of functors.

The latter definition is especially convenient when working with =
categories (or groupoids) in a category. For instance one knows =
immediately what is a smooth natural transformation (of course I is =
endowed with the discrete structure). It also allows to define =
immediately the horizontal composition for "higher order natural =
transformations", replacing I by its n'th power.

Dear Colleagues,

PhD studentship
Scalable Software Model Checking Based on Game Semantics

A three-year PhD studentship funded by the Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council is available from October 2003.  It covers
academic fees, and living expenses at the following rates: GBP 9,000
(2003/04), GBP 10,500 (2004/05), GBP 12,000 (2005/06).

* Project summary

Model checking has been a highly successful approach to verification of
hardware and protocols.  Recently, model checking of software has become
an active and important area of research and application.  In contrast to
hardware and protocols, software is often highly structured, and contains
objects, higher-order computation, complex control mechanisms, pointers,
concurrency, and other features.  Although impressive tools have been built,
a number of substantial challenges remain for software model checking.

One of the main breakthroughs in theoretical computer science in the past
decade has been the development of game semantics, which has produced
the first accurate models for a variety of programming languages and
logical systems.  Founding software model checking on game semantics has
the potential to overcome most of the remaining challenges, because
the models are compositional in the style of denotational semantics,
yet have clear operational content.

We propose contributions to theory and practice of the novel research
direction of software model checking based on game semantics.  Our main goal
is to enable compositional verification of programs and specifications which
contain large, polymorphic or infinite data types.  This has not been
addressed so far, but is necessary for the approach to scale to industrial
software.

The studentship will be supervised by Dr R Lazic, within the Theory and
Practice of Programming research group led by Prof D Peled.

Collaboration is planned with the Foundations of Computation research group
at Oxford, and with Formal Systems (Europe) Ltd.

There is another way of looking at the strict multiple globular category
case, which is to use the monoidal closed structure, as ws established via
the cubical case in

116. (A. AL-AGL, R. BROWN  and R. STEINER), ``Multiple categories: the
equivalence between a globular and cubical approach'', Advances in
Mathematics 170 (2002) 71-118.

This monoidal closed structure is fairly clear cubically, but is difficult
to translate into globular formulae in higher dimensions. If A=END(C),
where C is a multiple category (globular or cubical), so that A is one
also, then the `enriched composition' is  a morphism A \otimes A \to A. In
low dimensions this gives left and right whiskering A_0 \times A_1 \to A_1,
A_1 \times A_0 \to A_1, and there is also a function say
{  ,  }: A_1 \to A_1 \to A_2, which measures the lack of agreement of two
possible definitions of compositions, and I think this is what Tom refers
to in his email.
In the cubical formulation, A_2 consists of `squares', and the sides of the
squares are easy to interpret using whiskering. One way round the square is
a.g \circ f.v

and the other is
f.u\circ b.g

if f:a \to b, g:u \to v.

In the groupoid case, ideas of this type are used in

59.  (R. BROWN and  N.D. GILBERT), ``Algebraic models of 3-types and
automorphism  structures for crossed modules'', {\em Proc. London
Math. Soc.} (3) 59 (1989)  51-73.

and in other papers of Nick Gilbert. The extra structure on a crossed
module M (or 2-groupoid, for that matter) of a monoid morphism M \otimes M
\to M allows the modelling of homotopy 3-types. However, for calculations
of 3-types, crossed squares seem better, because of a Van Kampen Type
theorem, not apparently available for the other structures.

the point is that tableau calculus may be best understood as a search for
cut-free proofs in either classical or intuitionistic logic; this fact is
systematically overlooked in the literature on tableaux methods like in the
logic programming community one hardly ever finds exposed the view that
executing a logic program is nothing but unravelling an inductive definition

I think it is straightforward to give a sequent style formulation of the
Fourman/Scott interpretation. BTW one has to take care of inhabitedness
of types (in the general case) because variables of type A range over A
whereas terms of type A receive there interpretation in \tilde{A}, the partial
map clasifier of A. See e.g. Troelstra and van Dalen 2nd Chapter for a
traetment of what they call E-logic. Just as example the rules for \forall
look as follows

     \Gamma |- A(x)  x \not\in FV(\Gamma)
   ---------------------------------------
          \Gamma |- \forall x. A(x)

       \Gamma |- \forall x. A(x)  \Gamma |- t\downarrow
    ------------------------------------------------------
                    \Gamma |- A[t/x]


where  t\downarrow  stand for "t defined".

What I meant with my remark is that if one allows partial terms then one need
not have subtypes.

Best, Thomas

PS Fourman and Scott exploit higher order aspects already at first order level
because \tilde{A} is a subobject of P(A) , namely the subsingletons.

Dear Esteemed Category Theorists,

I have written the following paper for the
few people in the world who dread/hate category theory.
(I have been told such people exist. Perhaps you know of
some.) The paper takes an idea of Lawvere and puts
it into a language of sets and functions. Many examples are
given to show how one scheme can describe numerous diverse
phenomena.
The paper should be readable by any undergraduate with a
discrete math course. No category theory is used in the paper
but the spirit of category theory is employed throughout.

Enjoy,
Noson Yanofsky
===============================

A Universal Approach to Self-Referential
Paradoxes, Incompleteness and Fixed Points

Abstract:
Following F. William Lawvere, we show that many
self-referential paradoxes, incompleteness theorems
and fixed point theorems fall out of the same
simple scheme. We demonstrate these similarities
by showing how this simple scheme encompasses the
semantic paradoxes, and how they arise as diagonal
arguments and fixed point theorems in logic,
computability theory, complexity theory and formal

Thanks, Jean. As an assiduous student of CWM, I was aware of this and will
always wonder why Mac Lane didn't just make the point explicit in his first
edition in 1971. The only thing left to realize is that the category of
commutative squares which you mention is a subcategory of a product category and thus
has a couple of projection functors on it which can be used to follow a functor
to get the domain and codomain functors of the natural transformation, so that
this version of naturality is much more neatly packaged than the usual
diagram. I believe that there is a worker named John Baez (deep apologies for any
naive and unforgivable errors here) who says that Mac Lane claimed to be
interested not in functoriality so much as naturality when he was coinventing
category theory; I wonder when and if he realized that naturality is a brand of
functoriality. It would seem that this realization would come very early. In
general, if one fixes an argument in a bifunctor, the resulting function is a fully
extended intertwining function, and I believe that your point is that every
natural transformation arises in this way. So already naturality is an artifact
of functoriality. Mitchell notices much of this in his 1965 book.

Hello,

   I have been reading up on the Curry-Howard
isomorphism. In the last chapter of "Conceptual
Mathematics" Lawvevre and Schanuel say that the
logical connectives are completely analogous to
categorical operations x, map object and +. Is this an
oblique reference to the Curry-Howard isomorphism?

Thank you for your quick answer.
I am not sure to understand it quite well. I must confess that I =
consider myself much more as a differential geometer than as a =
"categoricist", so that I am not at all well informed about categorical =
literature. In fact I am often considered as a dissident in both fields, =
since my general philosophy is :
-first that there is a lot of interesting things to do in Geometry using =
categories, an idea with which unfortunately most geometers, save =
Ehresmann, disagree ;
- secund that most of the classical tools developed by category =
theorists, including Ehresmann, are not the best adapted for that =
purpose, and I tried to develop some alternative tools (which indeed =
most people ignore).
It is not the place here to say more on that subject.=20
About the precise point in discussion the main object of my letter was =
to emphasize the secund aspect of the definition (functor from I x A to =
B or more symmetrically to I x B), which seems less familiar (is it =
written somewhere ?) than the first one, and in my opinion the simplest =
and the most useful (at least for my personal use). For each arrow f of =
A from a to a', the image of  I x {a, f, a'}, which may also be regarded =
as an image of I x I, gives immediately a commutative square in A and =
its diagonal (3 x 3 =3D 9 arrows including the unit ones), where one =
reads immediately all the useful aspects of the data, displayed in a =
perfectly geometric and symmetric way, in contrast with the usual =
definitions, in which the two functors and the naturality arrow seem to =
play quite unsymmetrical roles. (Of course all of this is so perfectly =
obvious that I am convinced that plenty of people have noticed this, but =
I must confess that I have never read (nor heared) it, though in my =
opinion it is the best way of describing a natural transformation.)=20
I think also than it would be often useful to consider more frequently =
the obvious canonical structure of double category on a product category =
and especially on I x A, and I x I.

A definition of normal subcrossed module was given by Kathy Norrie in
her thesis, (see the references to her work in two papers in the April,
2003, issue of Applied Categorical Structures). Of course crossed modules
are equivalent to cat^1-groups, (G,s,t), so it is a nice exercise to do
the translation.  The expected answer is (H,s',t') such that H is normal
in G and invariant under s,t.

However categorical groups are different to cat^1-groups, so it is a nice
exercise to solve this problem. It would also be good to characterise
groupoid objects internal to categorical groups, since these
should generalise the congruences for those objects, and hopefully lead to
a definition of free groupoid in categorical groups, and so to notions
of free resolutions.

For cat^1-groups (and crossed modules) there is a nice notion of induced
object (see papers by Brown and Wensley in TAC, for example) which is
required to compute the 2-type of a mapping cone induced on classifying
spaces by a morphism of groups.

Best regards

Ronnie

PREPRINT ANNOUNCEMENT

Algebraic theories in monoidal categories
Luca Mauri

Abstract. We define a monoidal semantics for algebraic theories. The basis for
the definition is provided by the analysis of the structural rules in the
term calculus of algebraic languages. Models are described both explicitly,
in a form that generalises the usual definition in sets; and from a
category-theoretical point of view, as monoidal functors on suitable
classifying categories. The semantics obtained includes as special cases both
the semantics of ordinary algebraic theories in Cartesian categories, and the
semantics of operads and multicategories over sets.

The article is in PDF format (~250 KB, 26 pages) and can be be downloaded
using either of the following:

        "http://128.6.62.2/~mauri/Algebraic theories in monoidal categories"
        "http://128.6.62.2/~mauri/atmc.pdf" (older browsers)

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

Is anything known about the following variation on a Galois
connection?

Given domains X and A with partial orders, f:X->A and g:A->X
constitute a *Galois connection* if the following four conditions
hold

	(1)  x <= y   implies   f(x) <= f(y)
	(2)  a <= b   implies   g(a) <= g(b)
	(3)  x <= g(f(x))
	(4)  f(g(a)) <= a

(This is equivalent to saying f(x) <= a iff x <= g(a).)

The same functions constitute a *twisted Galois connection* if
we have conditions (1)-(3) and also

	(4')  a <= f(g(a))

Both Galois connections and twisted Galois connections compose.
If f:X->A, g:A->X and h:A->Z, k:Z->A consitute a (twisted) Galois
connection, then so do f;h:X->Z, k;g:Z->X.

Is there anything in the literature about twisted Galois connections
or the corresponding notion of a twisted adjoint, perhaps under
a different name?  Many thanks,  -- P

I have no idea what else is out there, but Sonnenschein once mentioned
the following paper to me:

An Axiomatic Characterization of the Price Mechanism
Hugo Sonnenschein
Econometrica, Vol. 42, No. 3. (May, 1974), pp. 425-434.

As of three years ago, I think that he was unaware of any other
category-theoretic economics papers.

Is there a suitable first isomorphism theorem in category theoretic lan=
guage? One barrier for me seems to be the correct notion of an image. W=
hat seems best right now would be that given f:X->Y, ker(coker f) =3D c=
oker ( ker f). Here the left hand side would represent im f, and the ri=
ght hand side X/kerf. If this is the right notion, what are the necessa=
ry conditions on the category for it to hold?

I'm not really answering your question, instead addressing the "if".

One of the classic examples of the isomorphism theorems is for rings,
and the category of rings (with unit) has neither kernels nor cokernels.
There are ways around that limitation in this case, such as:
* Don't require rings to have units; or
* Analyse any specific f in a category of X-modules.

But more importantly, I think that much of the point of the theorem
is that the image is a purely set-theoretic notion,
definable without reference to the algebraic properties of f.
In the category of sets, the image is (of course)
not realisable as the kernel of the cokernel,
but it does exist as the equaliser of the cokernel pair.

It seems to me that the essence of the isomorphism theorem
is that the forgetful functor from algebras to sets
not only preserves limits (which we all know)
but also preserves images and coimages (defined as above),
even though it does *not* preserve coequalisers or cokernel pairs.
The classical form of the theorem is simply a reflection
of an inability to speak explicitly about
functors' preserving categorical constructions.

Let me just add to this reply (which is certainly one valid answer to
the question) the comment that I sent privately to the questioner that
exactness is sufficient for the FIT to be meaningful.

AIMS AND SCOPE


Rewriting logic (RL) is a natural model of computation and an expressive
semantic framework for concurrency, parallelism, communication and
interaction. It can be used for specifying a wide range of systems and
languages in various application fields. It also has good properties as a
metalogical framework for representing logics. In recent years, several
languages based on RL (ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been designed
and implemented. The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers
with a common interest in RL and its applications, and to give them the
opportunity to present their recent works, discuss future research
directions, and exchange ideas.

The topics of the workshop comprise, but are not limited to,

* foundations and models of RL;
* languages based on RL, including implementation issues;
* RL as a logical framework;
* RL as a semantic framework, including applications of RL to
   - object-oriented systems,
   - concurrent and/or parallel systems,
   - interactive, distributed, open ended and mobile systems,
   - specification of languages and systems;
* extensions of RL, including
   - real-time and probabilistic extensions,
   - tile logic,
   - rewriting approaches to behavioral specifications;
* verification techniques for RL specifications, including
   - equational and coherence methods, and
   - verification of properties expressed in modal and temporal logics;
* comparisons of RL with existing formalisms having analogous aims,
  including
   - rho-calculus,
   - structural operational semantics,
   - concurrency calculi,
   - dynamic algebras.

topology, category theory, and differential geometry.

In addition to plenary lectures of interest to the entire Conference
audience, there will also be shorter contributed talks in parallel
sessions.  Anyone interested in giving such a talk should contact one of
the organizers.

The meeting will begin with an evening reception on Friday, November 7,
and end on Sunday afternoon.  A more detailed notice  will be mailed later
this summer.  Information will also be available at the Union College
Mathematics Department website (www.math.union.edu) in August.

Union College is centrally located in New York's capital district about 10
miles from the Albany International Airport, easily accessible by train
from NYC, and just 3 to 4 hours by car from NYC, Boston, and Montreal.

We hope to see you in November!

   At the 1963 Model Theory conference in Berkeley, I pointed out
that an interlocking system of adjoints occurring in set theory and
type theory has also as a very special example the one arising in
the logic of parts. In Eilenberg and Kelly's 1965 pioneering paper on
closed categories, part of my result was cited and it came to be known as
the statement that Heyting algebras are cartesian closed categories.
In my papers "Adjointness in Foundations"(submitted December 15th
1967), "Equality in Hyperdoctrines...", and "Diagonal Arguments...",
I tried to clarify these and related matters. I became aware at some point
that Haskell Curry in one of his books had informally pointed out earlier
the possible importance of this as an analogy. In the late 1960s, Bill
Howard, a student of Mac Lane, began circulating his results which were
finally published in 1980; Howard's paper could be described as containing
an oblique reference to the closed category theorems.

   The term "isomorphism" which has emerged in the literature is
rather misleading since the map in question is bijective at best at the
level of subjective presentations, rather than at the level of objective
algebras. That is to say, a symbolic presentation of a particular Heyting
algebra can always be construed in many ways as an image of a
presentation of a cartesian closed category, but there is the additional
draconian rule of inference which says that any two maps with a given
domain and codomain are equal. I tried to give a more accurate description
of this situation by referring to "an adjunction" rather than to an
isomorphism in my paper

 "Adjointness in and Among Bi-categories" Logic and Algebra, Lecture Notes
in Pure and Applied Mathematics, vol. 180, pp 181-189, edited by A. Ursini
and P. Agliano', Marcel Dekker, 1996.

In fact, as recent papers of Adamek,Lawvere,& Rosicky, and also of
Pedicchio & Wood, have exploited, such forgetful functors do preserve
all coequalizers of pairs which admit a reflexivity in the category; the
preservation of images is a consequence.

Dear categorists,

My Ph.D. dissertation, entitled `Dendrotopic Sets for Weak
Infinity-Categories', and a preliminary version of my paper
`Dendrotopic Sets' can now be downloaded from the web-page

   www.math.yorku.ca/Who/Grads/palm .

The content of the two works is summarized below, where they are
referred to as [A] and [B] respectively.

Best regards

Thorsten Palm


----------------

In his unpublished paper [1], Makkai defined a notion of _weak
infinity-category_ (under the name `multitopic omega-category'). The
underlying geometric structures, called _multitopic sets_, are
described in the three-part paper [2]. Makkai takes a weak
infinity-category to be a multitopic set with the mere property that
_compositions_ exist, which are defined as equivalences of certain
_coslice_ objects.

[A] gives a definition of weak infinity-categories equivalent to
Makkai's. While this definition falls into the same two stages, it is
considerably shorter and more elementary in each of them. The
description of the underlying geometric structures, called
_dendrotopic sets_ here, is done purely combinatorially (whereas [2]
uses the algebraic machinery of multicategories). A coslice object
comes in two guises, in both of which it is a dendrotopic set with
mild extra structure in the form of a dendrotopic map (whereas in [1]
it is a model for a new signature for Makkai's first-order logic with
dependent sorts).

[A] also presents an alternative method of introducing composition to
a dendrotopic set. Here one has to impose the extra structure of a
_universality system_: a subset that behaves in such a way that each
member can be thought of as a universal arrow. The main theorem of [A]
states that a dendrotopic set containing a universality system is a
Makkai weak infinity-category.

The concept of a dendrotopic set is defined at a more leisurely
pace in [B], where the equivalence to the concept of a multitopic
set is, indirectly, established.

Dear All

This is an announcement about a forthcoming research position at Bangor.

 The full announcement will appear on the web at : www.jobs.ac.uk within
the next few days.  The post is for 10 months only as the funding is for a
Pilot project and one of the tasks for the Research Assistant will be to
help in the preparation of an extended proposal.

Please draw it to the attention of  any suitable candidates.

Thanks

Tim Porter

PS. for people outside the U.K. If you don't know North Wales, it is a
beautiful area of the U.K. and the School Of Informatics is very near the
sea and the mountains!!!!

...................
UNIVERSITY  OF  WALES,  BANGOR

SCHOOL  OF  INFORMATICS
MATHEMATICS  DIVISION

Research  Officer
(Fractafolds, their geometry and topology)

Salary:  =A318,265 -  =A320,311 (on R&A Grade 1A) p.a.

Applications are invited for the above Leverhulme funded Pilot Project
post available for a period of 10 months.

Based in the Mathematics Division of the School of Informatics, you will
work on the problem of identifying a class of topological spaces that bear
something of the same relationship to certain well structured fractal
spaces as manifolds bear to Euclidean spaces.  This is a pilot project to
evaluate various candidate classes of spaces for =91fractafold=92 status.
The candidate spaces are fractal, but also are, in various different ways
=91homogeneously fractal=92.  The test for success will be indications
that a possible fractal analogue of differential geometry can be applied
to the study of these spaces.  Thus you will study the various classes of
candidate spaces to see if the development of such a =91differential
geometry=92 on fractals impo= ses
extra conditions on them or distinguishes between the different
candidate
classes.

Dependent on the success of this initial testing, it is hoped that a
full-scale project lasting a further two years will be awarded.  One of
your tasks will be to assist the project coordinator in the preparation of
full grant applications.

You should possess a strong mathematical background (PhD) with research
experience in one or more of the following areas:  fractals;  algebraic,
geometric or differential topology;  areas of analysis, or differential
geometry;  category theory;  or certain relevant areas of mathematical
physics (finite approximation theory, discrete differential manifolds,
etc.) or theoretical computer science (digital topology, constructive
analysis, etc.).

Application forms and further particulars should be obtained by
