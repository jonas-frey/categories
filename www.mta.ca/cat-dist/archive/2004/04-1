The future of Mathematics at Bangor

This future is still in doubt. I have had to prepare my own web site giving
information on this at

http://mysite.freeserve.com/maths_at_bangor

We would like to thank all those who wrote, since these letters gave a
tremendous boost to morale. I hope they also gave food for thought to the
authorities at the University of Wales, Bangor. They are also of interest
for the general issues some of them raise, and I hope to use this url to
bring out these and further issues. Perhaps more will be clear by the end of
January.

I hope those who wrote in are happy for their letters to appear in this way.
As I am going on holiday from the afternoon of January 4 till January 12, I
can do nothing more till I get back.

Some of you might like to ask for further information as suggested.

Best wishes and thanks from all of us.

Ronnie Brown

The workshop is held in conjunction with

                ETAPS 2004 (7th European Joint Conferences on Theory
                Theory and Practice of Software, March 27- April 4,2004)
                http://www.lsi.upc.es/etaps04/


AIMS AND SCOPE

During the last few years, it is becoming increasingly clear that a
great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition systems,
automata, process calculi and class-based systems can be captured uniformly
as  coalgebras. Coalgebra is developing into a field of its own interest
presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a growing field of applications
and interactions with various other fields such as reactive and interactive
system theory, object oriented and concurrent programming, formal system
specification, modal logic, dynamical systems, control systems, category
theory, algebra, analysis, etc. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its
applications.

 The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
   - the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
     approaches);
   - coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
     languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
   - coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
   - coalgebras and data types;
   - (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
     bisimulations or invariants);
   - coalgebras and algebras;
   - coalgebraic specification and verification;
   - coalgebras and (modal) logic;
   - coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid
      systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, Genova, Grenoble, and Warsaw. The proceedings appeared as
"Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS)", Volumes 11,
19, 33, 41, 65.1 and 82.1. Selected papers have been/are being published in
Theoretical Computer Science, Theoretical Informatics and
Applications, and Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.

You can get an idea of the types of papers presented at previous meetings
by looking at the tables of content of the above ENTCS volumes from these
meetings. They are available via the ENTCS page

CALL FOR PAPERS
AMAST 2004: 10th International Conference on
Algebraic Methodology And Software Technology
http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/events/amast2004/
****** Paper Submissions: 26th January 2004 ******
---------------------------------------------

AMAST 2004
July 12th - 16th, 2004
Stirling, Scotland, UK.

SPEAKERS
--------
* Roland Backhouse (Nottingham)
* Don Batory (Texas)
* Michel Bidoit (CNRS)
* Muffy Calder (Glasgow)
* Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen)
* JJ Meyer (Utrecht)

The major goal of the AMAST Conferences is to promote research that may
lead to the setting of software technology on a firm, mathematical
basis. This goal is achieved by a large international cooperation with
contributions from both academia and industry. The virtues of a software
technology developed on a mathematical basis have been envisioned as
being capable of providing software that is (a) correct, and the
correctness can be proved mathematically, (b) safe, so that it can be
used in the implementation of critical systems, (c) portable, i.e.,
independent of computing platforms and language generations, and (d)
evolutionary, i.e., it is self-adaptable and evolves with the problem
domain.

CO-LOCATED EVENTS
-----------------
AMAST will be co-located with MPC (Mathematics of Program Construction) and
ARTS (AMAST Real Time workshop).

TOPICS
------
As in previous years, we will invite papers reporting original research
on setting software technology on a firm mathematical basis. We expect
two kinds of submissions for this conference: technical papers and
system demonstrations. Of particular interest is research on using
algebraic, logic, and other formalisms suitable as foundations for
software technology, as well as software technologies developed by means
of logic and algebraic methodologies. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to, the following:

SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY:

    * systems software technology
    * application software technology
    * concurrent and reactive systems
    * formal methods in industrial software development
    * formal techniques for software requirements, design
    * evolutionary software/adaptive systems

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY:

    * logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms
    * constraint programming and concurrency
    * program verification and transformation
    * programming calculi
    * specification languages and tools
    * formal specification and development case studies

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS:

    * logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra
    * algebraic foundations for languages and systems, coinduction
    * theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning
    * logics of programs

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers):

    * software development environments
    * support for correct software development
    * system support for reuse
    * tools for prototyping
    * component based software development tools
    * validation and verification
    * computer algebra systems
    * theorem proving systems


PUBLICATION
-----------
As in the past, the proceedings of AMAST 2004 will be published by
Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

We invite prospective authors to submit electronically previously
unpublished papers of high quality. Submissions should not have been
published and should not be under consideration for publication
elsewhere.  Papers must be no longer than 15 pages (6 pages for
system demonstrations) and should be prepared using LaTeX and the
LNCS style that can be downloaded from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

Please send a fully self-contained PostScript file to
amast@cs.stir.ac.uk. If for any reason it is impossible to submit
a paper electronically, authors should send six copies of their
submission to the program chair at the address below. All papers
will be refereed by the programme committee, and will be judged based
on their significance, technical merit, and relevance to the
conference. Papers should be received by January 19, 2004.

Address for non-electronic submissions:
Charles Rattray

A new and an old preprint available.

The new preprint is: "Envelopes - notion and definiteness",
Aarhus Preprint Series No. 12 (2003),
http://www.imf.au.dk/publications/matppt/2003/12.pdf

Abstract: We examine critically some of the existing descriptions of the
envelope of a 1-parameter family of surfaces in 3-space. Using the
formalism of Synthetic Differential Geometry, the characteristic curves
(which make up the envelope) can be described as intersections of 1st order
neighbour surfaces. In the classical literature, such a description is
presented as having "heuristic" value, only.


The old preprint is: "Postulated colimits and left exactness of
Kan-extensions",
Aarhus Preprint Series 1989/90 No. 9. It has never been published, but due
to some recent interest in the results, I have digitalized this preprint;
it can be obtained from
http://home.imf.au.dk/kock/postulated.pdf


My Home Page has been improved, and contains now links AND short abstracts
for other of my recent articles, including the 2002 version of "Algebra of
Principal Fibre Bundles, and Connections"

---------------------------------------------------------------------

New PhD Positions (DEADLINE 15 February 2004! See "How to apply" below)

           Department of Computing Science,
     Chalmers University of Technology & G=F6teborg University
             Gothenburg, Sweden
            http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/

The Department has about 80 researchers, half being faculty members
and half PhD students. Our focus is on programming logic, type theory,
functional programming, formal methods, distributed and concurrent
systems, security, algorithms, bioinformatics, interaction design, and
language technology, but research is not restricted to these topics.
For more information, see http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research.

PhD positions are for 5 years. There is no tuition fee. A PhD position
is a regular job with social benefits; the salary amounts currently to
about 20600 SEK per month in the first year (the exact amount depends
on teaching duties, usually 20% of your time).

Knowledge of Swedish is not a prerequisite for application. English is
our working language for research. Both Swedish and English are used
in undergraduate courses.  Half of our researchers and PhD students
are native Swedes; the rest come from more than 20 different
countries.

Applicants must have a very good undergraduate degree in Computing
Science or in a related subject with a strong Computing Science
component. They must also have a strong, documented interest in doing
research.

You may even apply if you have not yet completed your degree, but
expect to do so by 1 September 2004. You are also invited to apply for
our new International Master's Programme in Dependable Computer
Systems, which can help you to obtain the necessary qualification, if
you do not yet have it (see http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Education/dcs/).

The School especially welcomes female applicants.

How to apply
------------

First, immediately register your intention to apply using the
electronic application form on the WWW via

  http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~reiner/PhD/phd-04-en.thtml

The full application should contain

  1 A letter of application, listing specific research interests
  2 A curriculum vitae
  3 Attested copies of degrees and other certificates
  4 Copies of relevant work, for example dissertations or
    articles, that you have authored or co-authored
  5 A description of:
    a previous teaching experience, documented
    b previous PhD studies, also in other subjects;
      state financial support obtained for these, if any
    c previous work experience
  6 Letters of recommendation from your teachers or employers

*** You MUST include Letters of Recommendation:
    we typically get over 100 apps, and it is
    simple not feasible for us to request individual letters ***

If you have financial support of your own (industry job, grant, etc.),
please state this fact clearly. It will increase your chances to be
accepted considerably, because you need not compete for the limited
number of fully financed positions.

The reference number of this job opportunity is 1/2004.

Send your full application (paper mail - application by email cannot
be accepted) to

  Department of Computing Science
  School of Computer Science and Engineering
  Chalmers University of Technology
  412 96 Gothenburg
  Sweden

to arrive by 15 February 2004.  You will know the result of your
application by 1 May 2004.

Dear all,

I wish you an happy new year 2004. Here are two announcements:

One new preprint:

Title: S-homotopy as an analogue of homotopy of spaces

Abstract:  We check that there exists a structure of model category on the
category of flows whose weak equivalences are the S-homotopy equivalences.
This model structure is simplicial, but not topological.

Url: ArXiv math.AT/0401033 or http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~gaucher/
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One new version of another preprint:

Title: Homotopy branching space and weak dihomotopy

Comments: new results about globular complexes added ; one technical proof
posponed to the appendix

Url: ArXiv math.AT/0304112 or http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~gaucher/

Inequilogical spaces, directed homology and noncommutative geometry
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 494 (2004), 22 p.

Abstract.
   We introduce a preordered version of D. Scott's equilogical spaces,
called *inequilogical spaces*, as a possible setting for Directed Algebraic
Topology. The new structure can also express 'formal quotients' of spaces,
which are not topological spaces and are of interest in noncommutative
geometry, with finer results than the ones obtained with equilogical
spaces, in a previous paper.
   This setting is compared with other structures which have been recently
used for Directed Algebraic Topology: spaces equipped with an order, or a
local order, or distinguished paths or distinguished cubes.

Hello Cat Community,

   Is the internal language of a topos E capable of
expressing metamathematical statements like "arrow J
is a subobject of the object X"?

Kind regards, Bill Halchin

        Comparing cartesian closed categories of
           (core) compactly generated spaces

      Martin Escardo, Jimmie Lawson and Alex Simpson

  It is well known that, although the category of topological
  spaces is not cartesian closed, it possesses many cartesian
  closed full subcategories, e.g.: (i) compactly generated
  Hausdorff spaces; (ii) quotients of locally compact Hausdorff
  spaces, which form a larger category; (iii) quotients of locally
  compact spaces without separation axiom, which form an even
  larger one; (iv) quotients of core compact spaces, which is at
  least as large as the previous; (v) sequential spaces, which are
  strictly included in (ii); and (vi) quotients of countably based
  spaces, which are strictly included in the category (v).

  We give a simple and uniform proof of cartesian closedness for
  many categories of topological spaces, including (ii)-(v), and
  implicitly (i), and we also give a self-contained proof that (vi)
  is cartesian closed. Our main aim, however, is to compare the
  categories (i)-(vi), and others like them.

  When restricted to Hausdorff spaces, (ii)-(iv) collapse to (i);
  and most non-Hausdorff spaces of interest, such as those which
  occur in domain theory, are already in (ii). Regarding the
  cartesian closed structure, finite products coincide in (i)-(vi).
  Function spaces are characterized as coreflections of both the
  Isbell and natural topologies. In general, the function spaces
  differ between the categories, but those of (vi) coincide with
  those in any of the larger categories (ii)-(v). Finally, the
  topologies of the spaces in the categories (i)-(iv) are analysed
  in terms of Lawson duality.

A van Kampen theorem for the homotopy double groupoid of a Hausdorff space

Summary:

We show that the homotopy double groupoid of a Hausdorff space defined by
the authors in a previous paper satisfies a version of the van Kampen
theorem, and so is a suitable tool for non abelian, 2-dimensional,
local-to-global problems.
The methods are analogous to those developed by Brown and Higgins for
similar theorems for other higher homotopy groupoids.

There is a detailed discussion of commutative cubes in a double category
with connections, and a proof of the key result that any composition of
commutative cubes is commutative.

Dear Colleagues,

Belated best wishes for 2004!

A substantially revised (and improved ;-) version of my CTCS02 paper
"A monadic approach to polycategories" is available on my WEB-page:

http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/TI-INFO/koslowj/RESEARCH/Moapp.ps.gz

The abstact is appended below.

-- Juergen Koslowski


%%  Abstract for: A monadic approach to polycategories

  Polycategories should form a rather natural generalization of
  multicategories: besides the domains also the codomains of morphisms
  are allowed to be strings of objects.  But while small
  multicategories can be elegantly characterized as monoids in a
  bicategory of set-spans with free set-monoids as domains, no
  such description of small polycategories seems to have been known so
  far.

  To address this problem, we first investigate distributive laws in
  the sense of Beck between cartesian monads S and T on a category X
  with pullbacks.  Some ot these can serve as tools for constructing
  new bicategories of S-T-spans over X, and monoids in such
  bicategories should be viewed as S-T-categories.  We identify a
  class of ``super-cartesian'' distributive laws that indeed produce
  such bicategories in a straightforward manner.  However, if S and T
  coincide with the free monoid monad (_)^* on set, there is no
  distributive law to get this construction off the ground.

  Since polycategories display a high degree of symmetry, a more
  symmetric substitute for distributive laws would be desirable.  If
  we decompose (_)^* into the free semigroup monad and the exception
  monad, a relation on (_)^{**} can be defined by means of three
  super-cartesian distributive laws that still allows us to construct
  a bicategory of (_)^*-}(_)^*-spans.  Its monoids turn out to be
  precisely the small planar polycategories.  General polycategories,
  as introduced by Szabo, require a different construction and a span
  instead of a relation.  However, only the notion of planar
  polycategory admits a 2-dimensional generalization, where objects
  are replaced by typed 1-cells.  The resulting ``fc polycategories''
  have essentially the same characterization as planar polycategories,
  but over the base grph rather than set.  In view of other
  shortcomings of Szabo's general concept this suggests that the
  planar variant of polycategories may be the ``correct''
  generalization of multicategories.

  One of the three distributive laws used in the construction above
  behaves like a ``complementation'' on the free semigroup monad and
  seems to be new.  We identify its algebras as associative double
  semigroups.  In fact, the free such structure on a set B can be
  extended from B^{++} to an associative double monoid structure on
  B^{**}.

  We then turn to the fundamental question, which spans between TS and
  ST correctly generalize (super-cartesian) distributive laws and
  provide an essentially associative composition for S-T-spans over X
  with canonical units.  This contrasts with Elisabeth Burroni's
  approach [BurroniE73], who weakened the notion of associativity for
  her notion of D-categories in order to encompass the non-cartesian
  power-set monad.  Our definition of (super-cartesian) generalized
  distributive law is best formulated in the fc-multicategory of
  spans and morphisms in [X,X]; this clarifies the notion of
  (super-cartesian) distributive law and justifies the added
  generality.

  Finally, we show how by first quotienting the bicategory X-spn the
  constructions outlined above can be used even for weakly cartesian
  monads .  In particular this applies to the free commutative monoid
  monad, which fails to be cartesian.  We than adapt the construction
  for planar polycategories to obtain symmetric polycategories in a
  similar fashion.

category-theoretic aspects of the following:

coalgebras and computing
concurrent and distributed systems
constructive mathematics
declarative programming and term rewriting
domain theory and topology
foundations of computer security
linear logic
modal and temporal logics
models of computation
program logics, data refinement, and specification
programming language semantics
type theory

Previous meetings have been held in Guildford (Surrey), Edinburgh (twice),

SUMMER SCHOOL

Inspired by the success of the graduate student preconference of CTCS'02 in
Ottawa, the CTCS of this year will have a similar event: A summer school
from August 9-11. The goal is to prepare students - both graduate and
undergraduate, with basic knowledge of category theory - for CTCS, through
mini-courses in the basic areas underlying some of the fields of the
conference. The school will offer the following  mini-courses (5 lectures):

      * Stone Duality, Coalgebras, and Modal Logic (Lecturer: Alexander
Kurz)
      * Game Semantics (Lecturer: Guy McCusker)
      * Operational Semantics (Lecturer: Pawel Sobocinski)
      * Categorical Models for Concurrency (Lecturer: Thomas Hildebrandt)


CMCIM WORKSHOP (new)

In between the summer school and the CTCS conference, August 11th,
there will be a half-day workshop on Categorical Methods in
Concurrency, Interaction and Mobility. The workshop has previously
been held in connection with CONCUR 2002 and CONCUR 2003.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts (less than 5 pages),
presenting recent results, challenges or work in progress. There will

                     NASSLLI04

        June 21-25, UCLA, Los Angeles

    (North American Summer School in Logic, Language
        and Information 2004)

        Last CALL for PROPOSALS
                Deadline: January 31, 2004

The third NASSLLI (after a successful start with NASSLLI02 in
Stanford and NASSLLI03 in Bloomington) will be held at UCLA,
June 21 - 25, 2004. The summer school will consist of a number
of courses and workshops, selected on the basis of the proposals.
Proposals are invited that present interdisciplinary work
between the areas of logic, linguistics, computer science,
philosophy and artificial intelligence, though work in just one
area is within the scope of the summer school if it can be
applied in other fields.

Submission Details:
Submissions should indicate
1) person(s) and affiliation
2) type of event (one week course or workshop, 2 hours a day)
3) an outline of the course up to 500 words
4) an indication of whether special equipment is needed to
    teach that course (beamer, computer ...)
5) a statement about the instructor's experience in teaching
    in interdisciplinary settings
6) expected costs (whether you want to be paid hotel and/or travel,
    or whether you are able to find funding)

Final Material:
We expect material for the actual courses at least *one month*
ahead of the conference if hardcopies of any material are to be
made available by us.

Financial Details:
A course may be taught by one or two persons. Conference fees are
waived for all instructors. However, we are only able to pay for
the full travel and expenses of one instructor per course. If two
persons are lecturing, they may share a lump sum paid for both.
Workshops are more complicated, and a proposal for a workshop
should include a plan to obtain some outside funding for the
speakers.

Deadline for submission:
January 31, 2004

          ETAPS 2005: CALL FOR SATELLITE EVENT PROPOSALS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

    ETAPS 2005

    European Joint Conferences on
    Theory And Practice of Software

    2-10 April 2005
    Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom

    http://www.etaps05.inf.ed.ac.uk

-- ABOUT ETAPS --

The European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
(ETAPS) is the primary European forum for academic and industrial
researchers working on topics relating to Software Science. ETAPS
is an annual event which takes place in Europe each spring since
1998. The eighth meeting, ETAPS 2005, will take place 2-10 April
2005 in Edinburgh, Scotland, hosted by the University of
Edinburgh.

The main conferences of ETAPS are:

- FOSSACS: Foundations of Software Science and Computation
Structures
- FASE: Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering
- ESOP: European Symposium on Programming
- CC: International Conference on Compiler Construction
- TACAS: Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis
of Systems

These conferences will take place 4-8 April 2005.

-- SATELLITE EVENTS --

The ETAPS 2005 Organizing Committee invites proposals for
Satellite Events that will complement the main ETAPS conferences.
They should fall within the scope of ETAPS. This encompasses all
aspects of the system development process, including
specification, design, implementation, analysis and improvement,
as well as the languages, methodologies and tools which support
these activities, covering a spectrum from practically-motivated
theory to soundly-based practice. Satellite Events provide an
opportunity to discuss and report on emerging research
approaches and practical experience relevant to theory and
practice of software.

ETAPS 2005 Satellite Events will be held immediately before and
after the main conferences, on 2-3 and 9-10 April 2005.

-- SUBMISSION OF SATELLITE EVENT PROPOSALS --

Researchers and practitioners wishing to organise Satellite
Events are invited to submit proposals in ASCII, PDF or
Postscript format by e-mail to the Satellite Events Chair,
Massimo Felici, massimo.felici@ed.ac.uk

A proposal should not exceed two pages and should include:

- Satellite Event name / acronym
- the names and contact information of the organizers
- the preferred period: 2-3 or 9-10 April
- the duration of the workshop: one-day or two-day event
- 120-word description of the workshop topic for later use in
publicity material
- a brief explanation of the workshop topic and its relevance to
ETAPS
- a schedule for paper submission, notification of acceptance,
and final versions (which should be no later than 18 February
2005)
- expected number of participants
- any other relevant information, e.g., event format, invited
speakers, publication policy, demo sessions, special space
requirements, etc.

The proposals will be evaluated by the ETAPS 2005 organizing
committee on the basis of their assessed benefit for prospective
participants to ETAPS 2005. The titles and brief information
about accepted Satellite Events will be included in the ETAPS
2005 web site, call for papers and call for participation.

Satellite Events organizers will be responsible for
- producing the event's call for papers and call for
participations
- publicising the event through specialist mailing lists etc.
to complement publicity for ETAPS as a whole
- hosting and maintaining a web site for the event
- reviewing and making acceptance decisions on submitted papers
- producing the event proceedings, if any; facilities for
printing will be made available by the ETAPS organizers
- scheduling workshop activities in consultation with the local
organizers

Prospective organizers may wish to consult the satellite events,
as examples, of ETAPS 2004: http://www.lsi.upc.es/etaps04/
and ETAPS 2003: http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/etaps03/

                       FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

                 Nineteenth Annual IEEE Symposium on
                LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (LICS 2004)

               July  14th - 17th, 2004, Turku, Finland
              http://www.lfcs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/lics/


The LICS Symposium is an annual international forum on theoretical and
practical topics in computer science that relate to logic in a broad
sense.  We invite submissions on that theme.  Suggested, but not
exclusive, topics of interest for submissions include: automata
theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,
concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,
constructive mathematics, database theory, domain theory, finite model
theory, proof theory, formal aspects of program analysis, formal
methods, hybrid systems, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic,
logical aspects of computational complexity, logics in artificial
intelligence, logical representation of knowledge, logics of programs,
logic programming, modal and temporal logics, model checking,
programming language semantics, reasoning about security, rewriting,
specifications, type systems and type theory, and verification.


Important Dates:
Authors are required to submit electronically a paper title and a
short abstract of about 100 words before submitting the extended
abstract of the paper.

 Titles & Short Abstracts Due : January 26, 2004
 Extended Abstracts Due       : February 2, 2004
 Author Notification          : March 27, 2004
 Camera-ready Papers Due      : April 25, 2004

All deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be considered.
Detailed information about electronic paper submission are
available from the LICS website.

Submission Instructions:
Extended abstracts must be submitted electronically in the IEEE
Proceedings two-column camera-ready format.  Each abstract must be in
English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee
to assess the merits of the paper. It should begin with a succinct
statement of the issues, a summary of the main results, and a brief
explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference and
to computer science, all phrased for the non-specialist.  Technical
development directed to the specialist should follow. References and
comparisons with related work should be included.  Extended abstracts
may be no longer than 10 pages including references, and must be
formatted in the IEEE Proceedings two-column camera-ready style (IEEE
style files are accessible from the LICS website).  If necessary,
detailed proofs of technical results can be included in a
clearly-labelled appendix in the same two-column format following the
10-page extended abstract. This material may be read at the discretion
of the program committee.  Extended abstracts not conforming to the
above requirements concerning format and length may be rejected
without further consideration.  The results must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of
other symposia or workshops.  All authors of accepted papers will be
expected to sign copyright release forms.  One author of each accepted
paper will be expected to present it at the conference.


Short Presentations:
LICS 2004 will have a session of short (5--10 minutes) presentations.
This session is intended for descriptions of work in progress, student
projects, and relevant research being published elsewhere; other brief
communications may be acceptable. Submissions for these presentations,
in the form of short abstracts (1 or 2 pages long), should be entered
at the LICS 2004 submission site between March 27th and April 4th,
2004.  Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by April
17th, 2004.


Kleene Award for Best Student Paper:
An award in honor of the late S.C. Kleene will be given for the best
student paper, as judged by the program committee.  For a submission
to be eligible, the research presented in the paper must have been
carried out while all authors were full-time students.  The program
committee may decline to make the award or may split it among several
papers.

Affiliated Workshops:
As in previous years, there will be a number of workshops affiliated
with LICS 2004; information will be posted at the LICS website.

INTRODUCTION
Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal
basis for the study and development of applications and
systems in Artificial Intelligence=2E With the depth and maturity
of formalisms, methodologies and logic-based systems today,
this claim is stronger than ever=2E
The European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (or
Journ=E9es Europ=E9ennes sur la Logique en Intelligence
Artificielle - JELIA) began back in 1988, as a workshop, in
response to the need for a European forum for the discussion
of emerging work in this field=2E Since then, JELIA has been
organised biennially, with English as official language, and with
proceedings published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in
Artificial Intelligence=2E Previous meetings took place in Roscoff,
France (1988), Amsterdam, Netherlands (1990), Berlin,
Germany (1992), York, U=2EK=2E (1994), =C9vora, Portugal (1996),
Dagstuhl, Germany (1998), M=E1laga, Spain (2000) and Cosenza,
Italy (2002)=2E
The increasing interest in this forum, its international level
with growing participation from researchers outside Europe,
and the overall technical quality, has turned JELIA into a major
biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to
artificial intelligence=2E

                      CALL FOR PAPERS


                         ICGT 2004

                 2nd International Conference
                   on Graph Transformation

           Roma (Italy), September 28 - October 2, 2004


The second International Conference on Graph Transformation ICGT 2004,
along with several satellite events, will be held in Roma at the end
of September 2004. It follows the first ICGT 2002 (Barcelona, October
2002) and a series of six international workshops on graph
transformation with applications in computer science held from 1978 to
1998 in Europe and the USA. The conference takes place under the
auspices of EATCS, EASST, and IFIP WG 1.3.  The proceedings will
appear in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series by
Springer-Verlag.
The conference is co-located with IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages
and Human Centric Computing (VL/HCC) September 26-29, 2004.


Scope.  Graphical structures of various kinds (like graphs, diagrams,
visual sentences and others) are very useful to describe complex
structures and systems in a direct and intuitive way. These structures
are often augmented by formalisms which add to the static description
a further dimension modelling the evolution of systems via any kind of
transformation of such graphical structures. The field of Graph
Transformation is concerned with the theory, applications and
implementation issues of all these formalisms.

The theory is strongly related to areas such as graph theory and graph
algorithms, formal language and parsing theory, theory of concurrency
and distributed systems, formal specification and verification, logic
and semantics. The application areas include all those fields of
Computer Science, Information Processing, Engineering and Natural
Sciences.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following.

On the more theoretical side:

- General models of graph transformation
- Node-, edge-, and hyperedge replacement graph grammars
- Concurrency, distribution, and formal semantics
- Term graph rewriting
- Network computing
- High-level replacement systems
- Hierarchical graphs and decompositions of graphs
- Logic expression of graph transformation properties
- Graph theoretical properties of graph languages
- Geometrical and topological aspects of graph transformation
- Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages
- Analysis of graph transformation systems
- Structuring and modularization concepts
- Semantics of UML and other visual modelling techniques

On the more applied side:

- Specification languages
- Implementation of programming languages
- Design of visual programming environments
- Massively parallel computing
- Bioinformatics
- Software engineering and modular systems
- Development of meta CASE tools
- Software architecture
- Information security
- Visual languages
- Bio-computing
- Actor systems and Petri nets
- Rule- and knowledge-based systems
- Pattern generation and picture processing
- Pattern matching
- Tool support
- Graph exchange formats
- Layout algorithms

Dear categorists,

this is to announce the availability of my book

   Joachim Kock
   Frobenius algebras and 2D topological quantum field theories
   LMSST 59, Cambridge (see http://books.cambridge.org/0521832675.htm).

It's a rather long account of the 'folk theorem' that 2D topological
quantum field theories are the same thing as commutative Frobenius
algebras, as well as the more general fact that the category of oriented =
2D
cobordisms is (equivalent to) the free symmetric monoidal category on a
commutative Frobenius object.

The novelty is mostly the idea of explaining all this to undergraduates,
using it as an 'excuse' for doing category theory.  In fact, the book can
as well be seen as an introduction to monoidal categories and categorical
viewpoints, and aims also at giving the young reader an impression of uni=
ty
in mathematics, with a very close interplay between algebra and topology.

For the expert readership of this mailing list, perhaps the amount of
details presented in the book will be boring at times, but in any case I
think you will enjoy the more than 200 figures, before passing on the boo=
k
to your students...

Cheers,
Joachim.
