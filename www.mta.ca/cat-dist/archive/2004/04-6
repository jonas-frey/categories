A preprint of a paper entitled

"A comonadic account of behavioural covarieties of coalgebras"

is available for downloading as a pdf file from

www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~rob

Rob Goldblatt


ABSTRACT
A class $K$ of coalgebras for an endofunctor $T:\Set\to\Set$ is a
\textit{behavioural covariety}
if it is closed under disjoint unions and images of bisimulation
relations (hence closed under
images and domains of coalgebraic morphisms, including subcoalgebras).
$K$ may be thought of as
the class of all coalgebras that satisfy some computationally
significant property. In any logical system suitable for specifying
properties of state-transition systems in the Hennessy-Milner style,
each formula will define a class of models that is a behavioural
variety.

Assume that the forgetful functor on $T$-coalgebras has a right
adjoint, providing for
the construction of cofree coalgebras, and let $\G^T$ be the comonad
arising from this
adjunction. Then we show that behavioural covarieties $K$ are
(isomorphic to) the Eilenberg-Moore categories of coalgebras for
certain comonads $\G^K$ naturally associated with $\G^T$. These are
called \textit{pure subcomonads} of $\G^T$, and a categorical
characterization of them is given,
involving a pullback condition on the naturality squares of a
transformation from $\G^K$ to $\G^T$.

We show that  there is a bijective correspondence between behavioural
covarieties of $T$-coalgebras and isomorphism classes of pure
subcomonads of $\G^T$.

What about "r" (pronounced "rev"), denoting 2*pi, in the archaic but still
widely understood phrase "33 rpm record"?

A shame the Greeks chose pi rather than rev, for I think the latter is
more fundamental.

This is to advertise the monograph

        "Synthetic topology of data types and classical spaces"

    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/papers/entcs87.pdf (or dvi or ps)

which will appear soon in volume 83 of ENTCS.

NB. (1) For those of you who attended my PSSL talk in Cambridge: The
topos-theoretic treatment of synthetic topology has not been included
here. (2) This monograph supersedes a preliminary version which was
previously available from my web page.

Martin Escardo

Summary (not as in the monograph)

This monograph consists of three parts divided in 6+5+2 chapters.

Part II (topology of classical spaces) applies the exponential law for
function spaces, with the aid of the Sierpinski space, to develop the
core of classical topology in a transparent (and constructive)
way. Mathematicians can start from this part, and even confine their
attention to it.

Part I (topology of data types) emulates the second and stands on its
own. It starts from the well known ideas that (1) the Sierpinski space
plays the role a data type of results of semidecisions or
observations, and (2) the notion of continuous map has that of
computable or programmable map as a computational counterpart. The
development of the synthetic topology of data types offered in this
part is operational rather than denotational. This is to emphasize
that the topology is there, even in the case of sequential programming
languages, independently of which denotational model one favours (if
any).

Part III starts by unifying the first and the second, again following
well known ideas, and then develops further applications to
computation, this time with the aid of denotational semantics.  In
particular, the Tychonoff theorem for countably many factors is
invoked to establish termination of a certain program (in the
simply-typed lambda calculus with natural numbers and fixed-point
recursion). In turn, termination of the program implies the Tychonoff
theorem for countably many second countable compact spaces.

                  http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/rdp05/tlca/


The TLCA series of conferences serves as a forum for presenting original
research results that are broadly relevant to the theory and applications
of typed lambda calculi and related systems. The following list of topics
is non-exhaustive:

   * Typed and untyped lambda-calculi as models of computation.
   * Proof-theory: Natural deduction, sequent calculi, cut elimination
     and normalization. Propositions as types, linear logic and proof nets.
   * Types: Subtypes, dependent types, type inference, polymorphism,
     types for security.
   * Semantics: Denotational semantics, game semantics, realizability,
     categorical models.
   * Programming languages: Foundations of functional and object-oriented
     programming, proof search, logic programming, type checking.
   * Implementation: Abstract machines, parallel execution, optimal
     reduction, program optimization.
   * Computer-aided reasoning.

The programme of TLCA'05 will consist of three invited talks and about 25
papers selected from original contributions. Accepted papers will be published
as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

I don't have access to a decent library at the moment, and I can't
afford a copy of the Elephant myself, so can anyone let me know:

In the category of toposes and geometric morphisms, under what
conditions is coproduct stable under pullback?

Any reasonable conditions on the toposes or the morphisms would be
helpful, but the more general, the better.
Thanks,

Barney.

Answer: always. Let f:E-->S+S' be a morphism of toposes. Identify S+S'
with the product of the categories S and S'. Then in S+S' the terminal
object (1,1) is a coproduct (1,0)+(0,1). Now apply the inverse image
functor f* to obtain a decomposition 1=X_1+X_2 of the terminal object 1
in E. By extensivity of E, then, the category E is equivalent to the
product E/X_1 x E/X_2; in other words, the topos E is the coproduct
of the toposes E/X_1 and E/X_2. (Where E/X_1 and E/X_2 are of course
the pullbacks along f of the injections S-->S+S' and S'-->S+S'.)

This argument is contained in

Marta Bunge & Stephen Lack, Van Kampen theorems for toposes, Adv. Math.
179:291-317, 2003.

where it is seen as part of the fact that the 2-category of toposes
is extensive.

Here's an abstract:

   Neural Networks, Knowledge, and Cognition: A Mathematical Semantic Model
   Based upon Category Theory, by M. J. Healy and T. P. Caudell

   Category theory can be applied to mathematically model the semantics of
   cognitive neural systems.  We discuss semantics as a hierarchy of
   concepts, or symbolic descriptions of items sensed and represented in
   the connection weights distributed throughout a neural network.  The
   hierarchy expresses subconcept relationships, and in a neural network
   it becomes represented incrementally through a Hebbian-like learning
   process.  The categorical semantic model described here explains the
   learning process as the derivation of colimits and limits in a concept
   category.  It explains the representation of the concept hierarchy in a
   neural network at each stage of learning as a system of functors and
   natural transformations, expressing knowledge coherence across the
   regions of a multi-regional network equipped with multiple sensors.
   The model yields design principles that constrain neural network designs
   capable of the most important aspects of cognitive behavior.

Please let me know right away if there are any problems.  I'll warmly
receive any questions or comments.

A 7-page paper entitled

Filtered colimits in the effective topos

can be downloaded from:

http://www.math.uu.nl/people/jvoosten/effcolim.ps.gz

Abstract: we are concerned with the problem whether there
is a small full dense subcategory in the effective topos
(which would give a nice embedding of Eff into a sheaf
topos).
Since this topos has enough projectives, we may assume that
such a category consists of the \lambda-small projectives
for some cardinal \lambda.
Basically, there are two theorems:
1. For \lambda regular, uncountable: the \lambda -small
   projectives are dense, precisely if the constant objects
   functor \nabla :Sets --> Eff preserves
   \lambda-filtered colimits.
2. \nabla : Sets --> Eff does not preserve \omega _1-filtered
   colimits (hence, by 1., the countable projectives are
   not dense).

Hello,

Two quick questions:

a) It is well known that there is no vertical
composition of dinatural transformations.
How about horizontal composition?

i.e. Given
S,S':C^op x C---->B
T,T':C^op x C ----> B^op
U,U':B^op x B --->A
\alpha: S--->S' dinat
\alpha': T--->T' dinat
and
\beta: U--->U' dinat

is there a \beta \circ (\alpha',\alpha) and is it dinat?
It should be. But I can not seem to find the right definition.

How about if we restrict to a nice category of moduals for a nice algebra
over a nice field? Does that help?

I was hoping that the category of small categories, functors and
dinat transformations
should be a graph-category (a category enriched over graphs) but
am having a hard time
finding what the composition is. Did someone write on these
things?


b) Also, I was wondering if anyone ever wrote about
quasi-dinatural transformations. Those
are dinats where the target category is a 2-category and the
hexagon commutes up to a
two cell. They show up in something I am working on. But they are
very painful. Has anyone
worked on such things?


Any thoughts?

All the best,
Noson Yanofsky

Hello,

   Does anybody know of a Grothendieck biography? For
me many times it is helpful to read a bio to the
historical development of a person's work.

Thanks in advance, Bill Halchin

In general, the naive horizontal merging of dinaturals fails to be
dinatural.  This is discussed in the article "Functorial
Polymorphism" by Bainbridge, Freyd, Scedrov and me (Theoretical Computer
Science 1990, pp. 35-64).

Several counterexamples  are given there.

For example, in a cartesian closed category of domains or CPO's, consider
a dinatural family Y_A:  A^A --> A (e.g. in domains, let Y_A = the least
fixed point operator).  If you were able to compose this with the
"polymorphic identity" dinat id_A: 1---> A^A (i.e. a dinat from
constant functor 1 to (-) ==> (-)  where  id_A = the transpose of the
identity on A),  then the category would be degenerate (proved in BFSS,
Appendix A.4).

Of course, if the middle diamond (of an attempted merging of two dinat
families) is a pullback or pushout, then merging works. (see BFSS, Fact
1.2).

Re vertical merging, some things can be said quite generally: e.g BFSS,
Propn. 1.3.

For various generalizations, see Peter Freyd's paper "Structural
Polymorphism" (in TCS, 1993, pp.107-129).  Soloviev has also discussed
compositionality of dinats in several articles in JPAA.

Don't know of any "standard biography", though you could check out some
links on-line (the Triples home page lists the following:

http://www.fermentmagazine.org/rands/recoltes1.html
http://www.grothendieck-circle.org/
http://modular.fas.harvard.edu/sga/
http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~maltsin/groth/Derivateurs.html

(though the last two are reprints of papers etc)).  In addition, a French
publication "Bourbaki" (pub by Pour La Science - the French edition of
Scientific American) mentions him as part of that group - and has a rather
nice photo of him and his child.

Good luck!
