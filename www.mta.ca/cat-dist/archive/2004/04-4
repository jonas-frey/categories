I haven't yet digested the rest of Freyd's post, but all of the above,
including the notation x << y, the connection with collapsing maximal
Boolean intervals, the "historical" connection with Cantor, and a lot
more, can be found in a series of papers of Harold Simmons:

    H. Simmons, "The Cantor-Bendixson analysis of a frame", Seminaire
    de mathematique pure,  Rapport no. 92, Institut de Mathematique
    Pure, Universite Catholique de Louvain, January 1980.

    H. Simmons, "An algebraic version of Cantor-Bendixson analysis",
    in Categorial Aspects of Toplogy and Analysis, pp. 310-323,
    Springer LNM 915, 1982.

    H. Simmons, "Near-discreteness of modules and spaces as measured
    by Gabriel and Cantor", J. Pure and Appl. Alg. 56 (1989), 119-162.

    H. Simmons, "Separating the discrete from the continuous by
    iterating derivatives", Bull. Soc. Math. Belg. 41 (1989), 417-463.

The operation Freyd is calling s (and the associated relation <<)
arose in connection with the so-called Reflection Problem for Frames,
namely to characterize those frames that have a reflection into the
category of complete Boolean algebras.  When such reflections exist,
they can be found by iterating the functor A |-> N(A), which freely
complements the elements of A (and is also the frame of nuclei on A,
ordered pointwise), until it "terminates":

    A -> N(A) -> N^2(A) -> ... -> N^a(A) -> ...  (a in ORD).

(These maps are all both mono and epi and are components of natural
transformations between iterates of N).  A basic result here is that
N(A) is Boolean iff x << sx for all x in A.  The general reflection
problem remains open.

Dear Peter,

this story about ``infinity without infinity axiom'' is a bit confusing from
a (traditional) ``logical point of view''. Is the following reformulation in
accordance with what you mean?

In intutionistic higher order arithmetic (HAH), i.e. the logic of toposes
with NNO, it is consistent to assume that N is a subobject of P^2(Om). Even
more it is consistent to assume (as explained in the last section of part D
of the Elephant) that N is (isomorphic to) the orbit Orb(Phi) arising from
the Phi : P^2(Om) -> P^2(Om) whose least fixpoint is K(Om) \in P^2(Om) (the
Kuratowski finite subsets of Om). In a logical formula one would formulate
this as

          (InF)     Phi has no fixpoint in Orb((Phi)

where InF stands for ``Infinity `a la Freyd''. Evidently HAH does not prove
(InF) because it is inconsistent with classical HAH. But, of course, in
HAH + InF  one can construct a NNO as a subobject of P^2(Om). In other words
T/InF has a NNO (where T is the free topos without arithmetic).

For me HOL + InF (where HOL is *pure* higher order intuit.logic) looks like
a strengthening of HAH which is inconsistent with classical logic rather than
``getting infinity out of pure logic'' (as the logicists were aiming at).

Of course, you get more than mere consistency of HOL + InF because you have
that  Gamma(Orb(Phi))  is actually the rig of natural numbers in Set (where
Gamma = T(1,-) : T -> Set) but inside T one hasn't access to this nice fact
and, therefore, cannot really make use of it.

There arises the question to which extent HOL + InF (or equivalently HAH + InF)
is conservative over HAH. Is it the case that every formula of HA (i.e.
intuit. first order arithmetic) is provable already in HAH whenever it is
provable in HAH + InF?  Clearly, w.r.t. higher order arithmetic formulas
HAH + Inf is not conservative over HAH because InF is not provable in HAH.
But, of course, one might ask whether HAH + InF is conservative over HAH
w.r.t. 2nd order formulas of arithmetic. (These are a good measure because
up to some (admittedly somewhat nasty) coding a fair amount of analysis is
expressible in this fragment.) There is no end to questions like these
because one might also ask whether HAH + InF is conservative over HAH w.r.t.
formulas of HA^\omega, i.e. first order intuit. logic over G\"odel's T.
(HA^\omega is a typical system employed by people doing constructive analysis.)

But first things first. Does it follow from your result(s) whether HAH + InF
is conservative over HAH w.r.t. first order arithmetic formulas?

Best, Thomas

Dear Colleagues,
  This is to remind you that April 1 is the last day to submit a
title and abstract for a contributed talk at this year's MFPS
meeting. The meeting will be held on the campus of Carnegie Mellon
University from May 23 to May 26. There are a number of special
events planned, including six special sessions, each with a plenary
lecture by a leading researcher. The meeting is co-located with
the annual Association of Symbolic Logic meeting, which will take
place from May 19 through midday, May 23. Finally, there will be
a very special event on the evening of May 22. Cliff Jones
(Newcastle), John McCarthy (Stanford), John Reynolds (CMU) and
Dana Scott (CMU) will participate in discussions and reminiscences
about how the area of programming languages arose and how it has
evolved over the years. Please plan to attend the meeting, and
submit a title and abstract for a contributed talk if you wish
to present one. The available slots will be allocated on a first come,
first served basis. You can find instructions about how to submit a
title and abstract, as well as detailed information about the MFPS
meeting and a link to the online registration form at the MFPS XX URL

RESEARCH POSTIONS FOR DOCTORAL STUDENTS
Call for expressions of interest

Applicants sought in discrete mathematics

The Tampere Graduate School in Information Science and Engineering (TISE),
a graduate school affiliated with the Tampere University of Technology
(TUT) and the University of Tampere, expects to have research position
openings for doctoral students. The positions are renewable for up to four
years. Applications require faculty support from a TISE-affiliated
university. For general information see www.cs.tut.fi/tise/.

The Institute of Mathematics at TUT is interested in supporting TISE
applications in the area of discrete mathematics and theoretical computer
science, broadly conceived as including relevant areas of algebra, in
particular of categorical algebra, as well as of geometry and other
subjects. Within the spectrum of priorities represented in TISE and the
Institute of Mathematics at TUT, the emphasis of the present call for
expressions of interest is on theoretical rather than applied research and
on structural rather than algorithmic aspects of discrete mathematics.

TISE expects to issue a call for formal applications in or around
September 2004, and positions would be available starting January 2005. At
the present time expressions of interest are invited in the areas indicated,
to be sent to the undersigned, in order to explore the possibility of faculty
support.

The sine qua non prerequisite, in addition to general TISE requirements,
is authorship of an independent research paper in mathematics (other than
co-authored papers), of publishable content, whether actually published or
unpublished. Please transmit the relevant material only by postal mail.
Informal enquiries are welcome.

                  SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

   Workshop on Logics for Resources, Processes, and Programs

           (affiliated with LICS 2004 and ICALP 2004)

                   July 13, 2004, Turku, Finland

         Web page: http://www.loria.fr/~galmiche/LRPP04.html

===================================================================

***NEW***

- New submission deadline : April 24, 2004.

- There will be a Special Issue of the Journal of Logic and
Computation Semantics Corner after the workshop (subject to
the usual JLC refereeing standards).

===================================================================

A one day workshop on Logics for Resources, Processes, and Programs
will be held in July 2004 in conjunction with
LICS 2004 (http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/als/lics/lics04/) and
ICALP 2004 (http://www.math.utu.fi/ICALP04/) conferences in Turku,
Finland. The organizers and co-chairmen are Didier Galmiche, Peter
O'Hearn and David Pym.
Hardcopies of the preliminary proceedings will be distributed at the
workshop and a Special Issue of a Journal on these topics is expected
after the workshop.

TOPICS

The notion of resource is a basic one in many fields, but it appears
as central in computer science.  Various logics, typically involving
substructural  connectives, have been proposed in order to provide a
logical analysis of this  notion from different viewpoints. Examples
include linear logic (number-of-uses reading), the bunched
implications logic (sharing interpretations),  so-called separation
and spatial logics (pointer logic and local reasoning, logics for
concurrency, logics for data structures such as trees). Logics  such
as these, which may include  a wide range of modalities and
domain-specific operators, allow the description of properties of
systems, of process calculi, and of programs, and so provide bases
for specification and theorem-proving tools.

The objective of the workshop to provide a forum for discussion
between researchers interested in logics of resources (from
foundations to related calculi and applications) and researchers
interested in languages and methods for specification of mobile,
distributed, concurrent systems and their verification.

Topics of interest, in this context, include but are not restricted
to the following:

- Logics for resources: semantics and proof theory;
- Process calculi, concurrency, resource-distribution;
- Reasoning about programs and systems;
- Extensions of logics, e.g. with modalities;
- Languages of assertions, languages based on resource logics
(query languages, pointers, trees, and graphs) and reasoning;
- Theorem proving and model checking in resource logics:
  decision procedures, strategies, complexity results.

SUBMISSIONS

Researchers interested in presenting their works are invited to send
an extended abstract (up to 10 pages) by e-mail submissions of
Postscript files to D. Galmiche (Didier.Galmiche@loria.fr) before
April 24, 2004. Papers will be reviewed by peers, typically members of
the Programme Committee.
The cover page should include a return mailing address and, if
possible, an electronic mail address and a fax number.
Additional information will be available through WWW address:

FIRST GRADUATE STUDENT SUMMER SCHOOL, August 9-11.

Inspired by the success of the graduate student preconference of
CTCS'02 in Ottawa, the CTCS of this year will have a graduate student
summer school from August 9-11, sponsored by the FIRST graduate school
(www.first.dk).  The goal is to prepare students (with basic knowledge
of category theory) for CTCS, through mini-courses in the basic areas
underlying some of the fields of the conference. The school will offer
the following mini-courses (5 lectures each):

    * Coalgebras, Modal Logic and Stone Duality (Lecturer: Alexander Kurz=
)
    * Game Semantics (Lecturer: Guy McCusker)
    * Operational Semantics (Lecturer: Pawel Sobocinski)
    * Categorical Models for Concurrency (Lecturer: Thomas Hildebrandt)

The program for the summer school can be found at:
http://www.itu.dk/research/theory/ctcs2004/summerschool.html

Registration Deadline: July 1st.


CMCIM WORKSHOP, August 11.

In between the summer school and the CTCS conference, August 11th,
there will be a half-day workshop on Categorical Methods in
Concurrency, Interaction and Mobility. The workshop has previously
been held in connection with CONCUR 2002 and CONCUR 2003.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts (less than 5 pages),
presenting recent results, challenges or work in progress. There will
be no formal proceedings of the workshop, informal proceedings will be
distributed at the workshop. Thus, accepted material may be published
elsewhere at a later date.

Workshop participation is *free*, but requires registration.

Registration is done by sending an email to hilde@itu.dk, containing
`CMCIM2004-registration' in the subject, and your full name and
institution in the body.

Submissions should be sent as PostScript files to: hilde@itu.dk,
containing `CMCIM-submission' in the subject, and in the body the full
names of the author(s), title, and a text-only abstract.

ACCOMODATION OPTIONS

We have pre-booked a number of rooms for the conference and negotiated
a special rate for CTCS'04 participants in a number of hotels,
conveniently situated in the center of Copenhagen, but close to the
metro that takes you to the ITU in a few minutes. Please note that you
must make a final reservation for one of these rooms prior to July 1st
in order to benefit from the pre-booking and the special rates.

Cheaper accomodation is possible at a nearby youth hostel during the
summer school and conference. Book before May 15th to be sure to get a
room.

NEWS

Welcome to the first number of CP News, an initiative of the CP organizing
committee. We aim to provide a comprehensive summary of important news in
the area of constraint programming. The newsletter will be published quarterly
on 1st January, 1st April, 1st July, 1st October. Please email the relevant
editor with any news, event, report or profile you want published. To
subscribe, please visit http://www.math.unipd.it/cp-online/register


The CP organizing committee recently decided that CP-2005 will be held
in Sitges (near Barcelona) October 1st to 5th 2005. The conference will
be co-located with ICLP. Pedro Meseguer and Javier Larrosa will be local
chairs. Peter van Beek will be the program chair. The local organizers
have already arranged for an Annular Solar Eclipse to take place in Spain
during the conference.

The CP organizing committee also decided that CP-2006 will be held in
Nantes in 2006. Eric Monfroy and Frederic Benhamou will be the local chairs.

Each year, the CP community has the opportunity to elect two new members
to serve on the CP organizing committe. The committee consists of 10 members:
6 elected members, and 4 members drawn from the current and past local and
program chairs. If you wish to stand in this year's election, please send
your name and a short election statement to the Secretary of the Organizing
Committee, Toby Walsh (tw@4c.ucc.ie) by 1st June 2004. The electronic
elections will be held over the summer and the results announced at CP-2004.

Finally, don't forget. April 19th is the deadline to apply for the
CP 2004 Doctoral Programme .This is a forum held during the CP conference
to give PhD students visibility and an opportunity to discuss research and
career objectives with established researchers. More details at

REPORTS

Eighth International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics.
Program Chairs: Fahiem Bacchus and Peter van Beek. 4-6 January 2004
http://rutcor.rutgers.edu/~amai/aimath04/
The online newsletter contains a full report about this conference, which
featured sessions on constraints, preferences, satisfiability, portfolio
design, and game theory. http://www.math.unipd.it/cp-online/newsletter

PROFILES

The Nantes CP community is composed of researchers from two institutions:
-the CoCoA group (Continuous Constraints and Applications) of the
 University of Nantes (http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/lina/)
-the CD group (Discrete Constraints) of the Ecole des Mines de Nantes
 (http://www.emn.fr/)
These two themes are grouped together in the new CNRS common research
structure: the LINA. All together, this amounts to 13 faculties.
Our main goal is to develop techniques, languages, and tools for
discrete and continuous constraints. A longer profile of the activities
of the Nantes CP community can be found in the online newsletter.

The following article (7 pages) is available:

"Are operads algebraic theories?"

I exhibit a pair of non-symmetric operads that, although not themselves
isomorphic, induce isomorphic monads. The existence of such a pair implies
that if 'algebraic theory' is understood as meaning 'monad', operads
cannot be regarded as algebraic theories of a special kind.

Perhaps it is worth mentioning that in the ring of smooth reals R the
sequence a_k = 2^(-k) is Cauchy but has many "limits" because every
infinitesimal dx satisfies the condition "dx is the limit of a_k".
This shows that R is not Cauchy complete, not because limits of Cauchy
sequences are missing but because there are too many.

I once thought the above observation implied there can be no isometric
embedding of a Cauchy-complete field (e.g. the Dedekind reals) into R,
but now I am not convinced anymore.

Dear Categorists -

Some of you may enjoy this paper.  It's written for philosophers
of physics, so I take it a bit easy on the category theory, but
it does explain why I think the *-category of Hilbert spaces and
bounded linear operators is more important in physics than the
mere category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators.

Best,
jb

Quantum Quandaries: A Category-Theoretic Perspective

John C. Baez

To appear in _Structural Foundations of Quantum Gravity_,
eds. Steven French, Dean Rickles and Juha Saatsi, Oxford U. Press.

Abstract:

General relativity may seem very different from quantum theory, but work
on quantum gravity has revealed a deep analogy between the two.  General
relativity makes heavy use of the category nCob, whose objects are
(n-1)-dimensional manifolds representing "space" and whose morphisms
are n-dimensional cobordisms representing "spacetime".  Quantum theory
makes heavy use of the category Hilb, whose objects are Hilbert spaces
used to describe "states", and whose morphisms are bounded linear operators
used to describe "processes".  Moreover, the categories nCob and Hilb
resemble each other far more than either resembles Set, the category
whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions. In particular,
both Hilb and nCob but not Set are *-categories with a noncartesian
monoidal structure.  We show how this accounts for many of the famously
puzzling features of quantum theory: the failure of local realism, the
impossibility of duplicating quantum information, and so on.  We argue
that these features only seem puzzling when we try to treat Hilb as
analogous to Set rather than nCob, so that quantum theory will make
more sense when regarded as part of a theory of spacetime.

Good morning -- very, what with not just one but two very interesting
papers, from Tom Leinster and John Baez.

The following from John's abstract got my immediate attention:

>We argue that these features only seem puzzling when we try to treat Hilb
>as analogous to Set rather than nCob, so that quantum theory will make more
>sense when regarded as part of a theory of spacetime.

This calls for an immediate response.  I've argued elsewhere (perhaps not
sufficiently forcefully?) that Set is _very_ analogous to Hilb, _as part
of a *-category_.

The easily made mistake with Set is to view it as an autonomous category
in its own right (ok, so that's not a mistake in many contexts, but it is
when proposing to incorporate Set into a Theory of Everything).

A much better view is Girard's (which he applies to logic, but logic is, or
should be, a reflection of reality).  Girard starts out with a *-autonomous
universe (of propositions if doing logic, of objects if doing mathematics).
He obtains comonoids (intuitionistic logic if doing logic, sets or related
objects forming a CCC if doing mathematics) by finding them in a smaller
cartesian closed retract of the big universe, via bang, of-course.  (One can
in fact have a hierarchy of bangs, with the bigger bangs delivering dyadic,
..., n-adic comonoids and the smaller ones delivering posets, sets, finite
sets, finite sets of even cardinality, etc.)

This view of intuitionistic logic as a fragment of the bigger linear logic,
and of comonoid objects such as sets as a fragment of a bigger mathematical
universe, has the following benefits.


1.  It locates signature in the object.

Traditionally signature is determined by context.  Typical contexts are a
theory such as the theories of groups, vector spaces, Boolean algebras, etc.,
or a category such as the categories of any of these.  The signature thus
resides not in the objects but in the theories or categories of those objects.

Instead I propose to view all structure of an object, including its
signature, as an intrinsic property of that object independently of what
signature and structure other objects in the same universe might have.
This then permits dispensing with either theories or categories, at least
in their role as specifiers of either signature or structure.

To this end, organize each object A as a set of subjects, a set of predicates,
and an inference rule for taking A out of the loop in order to get straight
to the truth about the structure of A.  The only context needed is a tensor
unit I and its dual \Omega.

  Subjects: the arrows I->A
  Predicates: the arrows A->\Omega
  Rule: The compositions I->\Omega that bypass A, taking it out of the loop

This is a way of looking at Chu(Set,\Omega).  A Chu space (A,r,X) is a set
A of subjects, a set X of predicates, and a rule r:AxX -> \Omega giving the
value r(a,x) of predicate x at subject a directly.  A Chu space has no
other signature or structure.

The Chu construction embeds any autonomous category V with pullbacks
autonomously into the *-autonomous category Chu(V,k), via an arbitrary
selection of object k of V.  Chu(Set,\Omega) embeds Set autonomously---no
need to abandon the autonomous structure on Set, and it is located in the
broader context of a universe whose properties can be considered "puzzling
features" in John's sense.

While this simple representation might not seem capable of accommodating
much structure, an impressively wide variety of structures for objects
are achievable with it.  For example, the structure of a Hilbert space,
as Lafont and Streicher point out, is representable as a Chu space simpy by
taking \Omega to be the set of complex numbers, without committing \Omega
to any particular properties of or operations on the complex numbers,
simply taking it to be a pure set.  (Actually L&S only embed Vct, but
Hilb is easily embedded as well simply by disallowing a few predicates in
their Vct embedding; also they don't actually say "Chu" and "*-autonomous,"
but they could have.)

Chu(Set,\Omega) embeds Set autonomously into the same *-autonomous universe
that also embeds Hilb.  Any difference between sets and Hilbert spaces is
internal to those objects, as opposed to being determined by context as
done traditionally.



2.  It furnishes a strikingly simple explanation for the "puzzling features"
John alludes to.

Once the place of Set in the grander scheme of things is seen, these "puzzling
features" that are traditionally accounted for in terms of Hilbert spaces
can really be seen as having a more fundamental origin: structure.

(As a slight digression on whether it is fair to characterize sets as
really being devoid of structure, certainly their *elements* are discretely
organized, but their *predicates* are highly organized.  The discreteness is
really a result of emphasizing the elements over the predicates; the same
object viewed from the dual perspective interchanging these is heavily
structured!)

Granted Hilbert spaces give rise to puzzling features, but complete
semilattices give rise to essentially the same puzzling features.  It is
not Hilbert spaces or complete semilattices that are doing this, it is the
much broader notion that *structure* is doing this.  Hilbert spaces are
just structured objects; so are complete semilattices; so are sets.

My views on the role of structure in creating the strangeness of quantum
mechanics appeared in an early form in 1992 in "Linear Logic for Generalized
Quantum Mechanics," without Chu spaces however, available as

  http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/ql.pdf

>From the abstract: "In this extension [of quantum reasoning] the uncertainty
tradeoff [of complementary or dual quantities] emerges via the structure
veil."  The paper argues that the basis for Heisenberg uncertainty is the
structure veil as an unavoidable phenomenon on one side of the duality or
the other attributable to Stone duality, not just qualitatively but even
quantitatively to some extent.

Shortly thereafter I realized that Chu spaces was the perfect framework for
these ideas, and described the idea at the 1992 Cosener's House (Abingdon)
meeting on domain theory and games, where I characterized Chu(Set,K) as
"A Theory of Everything dual to a Model of Everything."  Subsequent papers
further developed the theme, e.g. "Rational Mechanics and Natural Mathematics"
(TEMPUS'94 notes), "Chu Spaces: Automata with Quantum Aspects" (PhysComp'94),
and "The Stone Gamut" (LICS'95).  In these more recent papers I tightened
up the quantitative aspect of structural uncertainty result by furnishing
every Chu space with its own "Planck's constant" defined as the reciprocal
of the area of the Chu space, which works beautifully!

I've largely neglected this QM relationship lately, partly due to competing
interests, but also from a sense that, for whatever reason, the idea
simply was not taking hold.  Something was wrong: the idea, the audience,
the timing, the exposition, ...  I knew neither what to fix nor how fix it.
If I ever find out I'll certainly be more than happy to write further on the
notion of quantum mechanics as the reflection in nature of pure structure,
as opposed to the conventional wisdom that ties it to specific structures
such as Hilbert space.

If anyone would like to argue against this, i.e. that pure structure is *not*
a good basis for quantum mechanics, the title "A Critique of Pure Structure"
has been taken only in the context of "The Limits of Rationality and Culture
in the Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism."


Anyway, on to point 3:

3.  It saves mathematics from Cantor's paradise.

In the *-autonomous view of Set as part of something bigger, a set A has
not just elements but also predicates.  Whereas the elements are structured
discretely, the predicates are structured logically, e.g. as a Boolean
algebra.  Forming the power set of A as \Omega^A or A-o\Omega means not
the production of an exponentially larger set, but instead the swapping
of the elements and predicates of A.  It is natural to want to repeat this
as \Omega^\Omega^A or (A-o\Omega)-o\Omega, but (as I mentioned in a post a
couple of weeks ago), as long as one remembers that power sets are heavily
structured then one simply recovers the original set A after the second swap.
"Doubly exponential" then has its involutory connotation as in logic rather
than its hugeness connotation as in set theory or combinatorics.

We all want to go to paradise eventually, some just sooner than others.
Combinatorialists and others sometimes want these huge numbers now.  This is
accomplished with bang.  Replacing the Boolean algebra B having 2^n elements
and n predicates (aka ultrafilters) with !B leaves the elements unchanged
while greatly increasing the number of predicates from n to 2^2^n, a double
whammy right there with one bang!  (This assumes \Omega=2 and Set bang;
other choices of \Omega and bang will give different cardinalities but the
general idea remains the same.)

One should measure combinatorial growth neither by the number of iterations
of exponentiation (which is an involution), nor by the number of bangs (which
is idempotent at least for little chu), but by the number of *alternations*
of exponentiation and bang.


Apropos of the "hierarchy of bangs" mentioned above, I'll be talking next
month in X'ian about using comonoids to generalize CPOs so that they work
more like logic.  CPOs are designed for the passage from A to A-and-B,
whereas logic caters not only for that passage but also the other direction,
from A to A-or-B.  The CCC of comonoids addresses both directions, and
moreover symmetrically.

I would *love* to know whether all T1 comonoids are discrete.  This question
applied to the special case of DCPOs is positively answered as an obvious
consequence of how one topologizes DCPOs, and the same holds for Lamarche's
larger CCC of "casuistries."  Neither of these enjoys the above-mentioned
up-down symmetry of logic however.  For the yet larger CCC of comonoids,
where this symmetry kicks in, the question seems to be dauntingly difficult,
and I've been posing it to people for eight years.  A year ago I decided
it was high time to offer some sort of bounty on the problem, currently at
$2,000, see http://thue.stanford.edu/puzzle.html for more details.

*********************************************************************
ABSTRACT:
We develop a theory of weak omega categories that will be accessible to
anyone who is familiar with the language of categories and functors and who has
encountered the definition of a strict 2-category.

The most remarkable feature of this theory is its simplicity. We build upon
an idea due to Jaques Penon by defining a weak omega category to be a span of
omega magmas with certain properties. (An omega magma is a reflexive, globular
set with a system of partially defined, binary composition operations which
respects the globular structure.)

Categories, bicategories, strict omega categories and Penon's weak omega
categories are all instances of our weak omega categories. We offer a heuristic
argument to justify the claim that Batanin's weak omega categories also fit into
our framework.

We show that the Baez-Dolan stabilization hypothesis is a direct consequence
of our definition of weak omega categories.

We define a natural notion of a psuedo-functor between weak omega categories
and show that it includes the classical notion of a homomorphism between
bicategories. In any weak omega category the operation of composition with a fixed
1-cell defines such a psuedo-functor.

Finally, we define a notion of weak equivalence between weak omega categories
which generalizes the standard definition of an equivalence between ordinary
categories.

Hi Vaughan,

> This view of intuitionistic logic as a fragment of the bigger linear logic,

is widely held but I don't agree with it.

A model of (propositional) intuitionistic logic is a bicartesian closed
category.  (I'm assuming we want to model proofs, not just provability.)

But a model of linear logic doesn't, as far as I'm aware, give rise to a
bicartesian closed category.

So there's no translation (at the level of proofs, rather than
provability) from intuitionistic logic to linear logic.

Paul

Hi, Paul,


>> This view of intuitionistic logic as a fragment of the bigger linear logic,
>is widely held but I don't agree with it.

What's to disagree with?  Girard's ! admits bicartesian models.

>But a model of linear logic doesn't, as far as I'm aware, give rise to a
>bicartesian closed category.

"Give rise to"?

Granted the LL axioms don't stipulate that the image of bang be bicartesian
(have sum in addition to product), but neither do they disallow it.  The
interpretations of ! encountered in LL applications tend to be bicartesian
closed, in particular the one that my message was all about, namely Set.

>So there's no translation (at the level of proofs, rather than
>provability) from intuitionistic logic to linear logic.

Perhaps so, but then that's your problem, you're the one who's insisting on
a different definition of "intuitionistic" from the one Girard had in mind
when he axiomatized !.  If he'd wanted bicartesian closed, the axioms for
! would have said so.  Since you're the one who wants it, the responsibility
for axiomatizing !  accordingly is yours, not Girard's.

The map from Euler reals to Dedekind reals is not injective

(1) The rig of uppercuts in Q serves as value-space for metrics;
call it the Dedekind reals for short.
(Mapping a ring to the Dedekind reals would only hit two-sided
cuts, but that is a separate issue. If Q denotes the nonnegative
rationals, then the term "arithmetic reals" would be justified, but for
the issue addressed here, Q might as well be "the constant reals"
coming from a lower topos).

(2) Euler affirmed that a real should be determined as a ratio
between infinitesimals. Adopting a rational definition of "ratios",
and conservatively interpreting the appropriate space T of
infinitesimals as the representing object for the tangent-bundle
functor, I call Euler reals the part R of the function-space T^T that
preserves the base point.
(T is regarded as given as a reflection of physical experience, so
not every topos has one. R typically has a unique addition
compatible with the obvious multiplication. If we define D as the
part of R of square 0, the Kock-Lawvere axiom would require that
there exist units of time, i.e., isomorphisms  T->D, or equivalently
certain non-unique semigroup structures on T itself (in contrast
with the canonical multiplication on our R)).

(3) Philosophically, the Euler reals serve not only to parameterize
motion but also to provide a means to express a cause of motion;
the cause operates at each single time, as is reflected in the fact
that T has a unique point. By contrast, the Dedekind reals serve to
measure, by Q-approximations, the changes resulting from motion
between pairs of times. Measuring, like photographing, kills the
particular motion; thus the map from Euler reals to Dedekind
reals, should not be expected to be injective. That map needs to
be understood in any smooth topos of interest,.
    (a) Of course, measuring can still derive information, perhaps
even enough information, about the causes of motion too: we can
pass to another moving quantity, e.g. velocity via a speedometer,
and then measure that via rational approximation. There is an
analogy with algebraic topology: pizero is a very crude measure of
a space, it would seem, but as Sammy liked to point out, if you
apply an appropriate geometrical  endofunctor first, then pizero can
deliver lots of useful information.)
(b) Any given object in a smooth topos will induce a function
presheaf on finite-dimensional varieties; since continuous
functions are not usually smooth functions, it is unlikely that the
Dedekind reals (even two-sided) will be included in R.)

(4) However, an inclusion Q->R of constants is to be expected; it
forms one ingredient for constructing the map under discussion.
The other ingredient is an ordering on R, inducing in the obvious
way the map from R to parts of Q. Several treatments of SDG
postulate such an ordering, but it always seems to turn out that the
ordering is not anti-symmetric (in particular that any closed interval
is closed under the addition of infinitesimals), illustrating the
non-injectivity of the map.
(In some cases there seem to be ways to construct the ordering
"synthetically", i.e., by categorical operations, such as
pizero(Aut(T)), applied ultimately to the object T.)

I hope this will suggest some clarification of the questions raised
by  Thomas and Andrej.

Hello,

   Is Goldblatt's notion of a bundle just a degenerate
case of a sheaf with the topology being the discrete
topology?

I have managed to post my paper "Omega Categories I" on the math archive:

http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.CT/0404216

A number of small changes have been made as compared with the undated version
of the paper which many of you have: spelling errors and some notational
errors have been corrected, the diagram associated with the definition of omega
pseudo-functor on page 36 has been corrected, section 9.3 has been shortened and
strengthened while a new but obvious result has been added to section 9.5

Dear everyone, I have a question about terminology:

  What would you call a regular category in which every object has an
  essentially small category of quotients (the full subcategory of the
  coslice category consisting of regular epis)?

I suppose "well-copowered"/"cowellpowered" refers to _all_ epis?

Ivar Rummelhoff correctly observes that "cowellpowered" connotes  the
(essential) smallness of the set of ALL epimorphisms with a given domain.
It is reasonable to use "weakly cowellpowered" for the corresponding
smallness of the set of STRONG epimorphisms; and these coincide with the
regular epimorphisms in his case of a regular category. In situations more
general than this, one had better explain one's meaning in unambiguous
words.

                    LAST CALL FOR PAPERS


                         ICGT 2004

                 2nd International Conference
                   on Graph Transformation

           Roma (Italy), September 28 - October 2, 2004


The second International Conference on Graph Transformation ICGT 2004,
along with several satellite events, will be held in Roma at the end
of September 2004. It follows the first ICGT 2002 (Barcelona, October
2002) and a series of six international workshops on graph
transformation with applications in computer science held from 1978 to
1998 in Europe and the USA. The conference takes place under the
auspices of EATCS, EASST, and IFIP WG 1.3.  The proceedings will
appear in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series by
Springer-Verlag.
The conference is co-located with IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages
and Human Centric Computing (VL/HCC) September 26-29, 2004.


Scope.  Graphical structures of various kinds (like graphs, diagrams,
visual sentences and others) are very useful to describe complex
structures and systems in a direct and intuitive way. These structures
are often augmented by formalisms which add to the static description
a further dimension modelling the evolution of systems via any kind of
transformation of such graphical structures. The field of Graph
Transformation is concerned with the theory, applications and
implementation issues of all these formalisms.

The theory is strongly related to areas such as graph theory and graph
algorithms, formal language and parsing theory, theory of concurrency
and distributed systems, formal specification and verification, logic
and semantics. The application areas include all those fields of
Computer Science, Information Processing, Engineering and Natural
Sciences where static and dynamic modeling by graphical structures and
graph transformations, respectively, play an important role.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following.

On the more theoretical side:

- General models of graph transformation
- Node-, edge-, and hyperedge replacement graph grammars
- Concurrency, distribution, and formal semantics
- Term graph rewriting
- Network computing
- High-level replacement systems
- Hierarchical graphs and decompositions of graphs
- Logic expression of graph transformation properties
- Graph theoretical properties of graph languages
- Geometrical and topological aspects of graph transformation
- Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages
- Analysis of graph transformation systems
- Structuring and modularization concepts
- Semantics of UML and other visual modelling techniques

On the more applied side:

- Specification languages
- Implementation of programming languages
- Design of visual programming environments
- Massively parallel computing
- Bioinformatics
- Software engineering and modular systems
- Development of meta CASE tools
- Software architecture
- Information security
- Visual languages
- Bio-computing
- Actor systems and Petri nets
- Rule- and knowledge-based systems
- Pattern generation and picture processing
- Pattern matching
- Tool support
- Graph exchange formats
- Layout algorithms

                             Sixth workshop on
                     Geometric and Topological Methods
                  in Concurrency and Distributed Computing

                                 GETCO 2004

   Affiliated with DISC 2004

   Venue: Amsterdam, the Netherlands

   Conference dates:
   DISC: 4-8 October 2004
   GETCO: 4 October 2004

                              Call for Papers

Scope

   The main mathematical disciplines that have been used in computer
   science are discrete mathematics (especially graph theory and ordered
   structures), logics (mostly proof theory for all kinds of logics,
   classical, intuitionistic, modal etc.) and category theory (cartesian
   closed categories, topoi etc.). General Topology has also been used
   for instance in denotational semantics, with relations to ordered
   structures in particular.

   Recently, ideas and notions from mainstream "geometric" topology and
   algebraic topology have entered the scene in Concurrency Theory and
   Distributed Systems Theory (some of them based on older ideas). They
   have been applied in particular to problems dealing with coordination
   of multi-processor and distributed systems (see the historical
   note ). Among those are techniques borrowed from algebraic and
   geometric topology: Simplicial techniques have led to new theoretical
   bounds for coordination problems. Higher dimensional automata have
   been modelled as cubical complexes with a partial order reflecting the
   time flows, and their homotopy properties allow to reason about a
   system's global behaviour.

   The GETCO workshops aim at bringing together researchers from both the
   mathematical (geometry, topology, algebraic topology etc.) and
   computer scientific side (concurrency theorists, semanticians,
   algorithmicians, researchers in distributed systems etc.) with an
   active interest in these or related developments.

   Topics include (but are not limited to):
     * Algorithmics for Concurrent or Distributed Systems
     * Fault-tolerant Protocols for Distributed Systems
     * Semantics
     * Concurrency Theory
     * Model-checking
     * Abstract Interpretation
     * Geometric/Topological models
     * Applications of algebraic topology
     * Category theory

Paper submission

   Submissions to the workshop may be of two forms:
     * Short abstracts: up to 4 pages, in format A4, typeset 11 points
     * Full papers: up to 12 pages, in format A4, typeset 11 points
       (excluding bibliography and technical appendices)

   Both forms of submission should include a separate page with the
   following information: title, author(s), corresponding author, contact
   information and a 12-15 lines summary. Simultaneous submission to
   other conferences or journals is only allowed for short abstracts.

   Electronic submission is strongly encouraged. The paper or abstract
   should be sent by e-mail in the form of a postscript file to both the
   addresses raussen@math.aau.dk and haucourt@cea.fr. The
   accompanying page should be sent in a separate email message. If
   surface mail has to be used, then 3 copies of the paper/abstract

Colin had asked about cohomology theory for not necessarily Grothendieck
toposes.

A specific question concerning topos cohomology is the following:

Does every geometric morphism have right-derived functors on abelian
objects?

In principle, this would not require enough injectives
since the universal property requested does not involve any specific
kind of resolution.

I think not. In my new Foreword to Abelian Categories on TAC
(www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/3/foreword.pdf), specifically in
the comments about pages 131-132, I recall the description of a locally
small topos in which  Ext(A,B)  wants to have proper classes as values.

Dear UACTers,

Luca Aceto asked me yesterday, in the context of results of his about
theories of parallel composition, about conditions for a finitely based
theory to remain so after removal of any operation.

It occurred to me that his question could be usefully formulated in terms
of a suitable notion of basis convexity.  Call a theory *basis convex*
when its axiom rank (minimum size of axiomatization, e.g. fewest axioms
in the case of equational theories) is no smaller than that of any theory
it conservatively extends.  Useful variants or extensions would involve
cardinality conditions or restrictions, e.g. only allowing limit ordinals
for axiom rank in order to immunize the notion against mere finite increases
in rank.

This seems like a simple and natural notion.  For example the equational
theory of regular expressions, viewed as a monotonic fixpoint logic with
a conjunction ab, a disjunction a+b, and a fixpoint operator *, is not
finitely based (Redko 1964, Conway 1971), but its conservative extension
with (nonmonotonic) implication x->y is, proved by borrowing Tarski and
Ng's axiom (x\x)* < x\x for their system RAT, RA with transitive closure.
Had this adjective occurred to me (slaps forehead with flat of hand) when I
wrote this up for JELIA'90, not only could whole sentences have been shrunk
down to just this adjective, the result could have been title of the paper:
"The Theory of Conditional Regular Expressions is Not Basis Convex."

Does this concept exist already?  If so what is known about it, e.g.
necessary or sufficient conditions?  And does it relate to other convexity
notions such as what Joyal calls softness and the Nelson-Oppen-Shostak
theorem-proving crowd calls convexity?  This is the condition:

    if a&b -> cvd is in the theory,
    then so is one of a -> c, a -> d, b -> c, or b -> d.

(In the classical case with a,b,c,d literals it is enough to require just
a&b -> c or a&b -> d, true for Nelson-Oppen but not for Joyal.)

Orthomodularity might be another candidate for some kind of nonconvexity
(concavity?), by analogy with regular expressions -- neither metrical
completeness of inner product spaces (Goldblatt, JSL 1984) nor transitive
closure of binary relations as respective associated dual notions are
elementary, a phenomenon that could conceivably play a role in basis
convexity.

(I won't promise to pass on specific questions at question time, but I'd be
happy to try to condense suggested questions into one or two suitable ones

the actual talk.  Always hard to know what to ask in advance of hearing

Dept. of Mathematics Colloquium

Thursday April 22, 4:15 PM, Room 380:380W

Speaker: Solomon Feferman, Stanford

Title: What foundations for category theory?

Abstract.  Naive category theory leads to certain constructions such as
"the category of all categories" and "the category of all functors between
two given categories", that border on inconsistency and necessitate
consideration of foundations for the subject.  Even applications of
category theory to homological algebra, for example, raise problems.
Two kinds of set-theoretical foundations for category theory have been
proposed by Mac Lane and Grothendieck, but each has its drawbacks.
In this talk I will describe a more logically sophisticated
set-theoretical foundation that improves on these by means of
reflective universes.

Tea in advance, Bldg. 380 2nd floor lounge.

Subject: categories: Geometry of 2x2 real matrices
Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca

I'm writing about applications to commonplace physics phenomena of "the other
4D Clifford algebra", namely R(2), the 2x2 real matrices.  (The quaternions
H of course being the prototype to which this is "the other".  The only
other Clifford algebras this size or smaller are smaller, namely R, C,
and the hyperbolic plane, call it J since we've already deducted H on line 3.)

(If anyone actually knows of such applications I'm all ears.)

Since a good many categorists are (were?) primarily motivated by geometry,
and particularly algebraic topology, I'm hoping this is a good place to
ask the following.

The geometry of the quaternions, certainly for its vector part (zero real
part), seems clear enough, namely that of ordinary Euclidean 3-space.
If x,y are unit vectors with 1,x,y,xy linearly independent then x,y,xy is a
right-handed coordinate system.  (But is there a coherent notion of handedness
for a triple like i,1,j or j,k,1 and if so what's it good for?  Should 3D
subspaces that include the real axis be considered simply connected with a
flat Euclidean metric like the physical 3D vector space spanned by i,j,k?
Does 360 degree rotation work the same there as in the vector subspace?)

Whereas the geometry of the quaternions feels like 3-space plus a perceptual
axis (or something like that), the geometry of R(2) feels more like the
four walls of a room.  The hands of clocks on the north and south walls
rotate through circular angles while those on the east and west walls
rotate through hyperbolic angles.  Clocks not parallel to some wall seem
to rotate through both kinds of angles simultaneously, at relative rates
that depend on the angle to the walls.  (This is the general idea but when
I try to flesh out the details too intuitively I find myself injecting too
much Euclidean geometry at first.)

In the Erlangen spirit I'm trying to come to grips with the geometrical
invariants for R(2).  The metrical invariants are more or less clear enough.
(That said, computing the geodesics seems painful---is there a simple
distillation that isn't equivalent to being dragged through the calculus of
variations?  An elementary guide to the Lie algebra for R(2) would be great.
I actually need to calculate those circular-to-hyperbolic angle ratios as
smoothly varying quantities along geodesics so any software that does this
could be very insightful.)

Where I'm running into serious trouble is with the topological invariants.
For example what's supposed to happen near the light cone?

For quaternions the only choices for the light cone (depending on what
you're using quaternions for) are x^2 = y^2+v^2+w^2 and x^2+y^2+v^2+w^2=0.
The former is a real cone, the vector part (x=0) of which is just the origin,
while the latter (the roots of the Euclidean squared norm for the quaternions)
is the origin regardless of the real part.

R(2) moves y^2 (y being a measure of asymmetry, 0 for symmetric matrices) over
to the other side, making the choices x^2+y^2=v^2+w^2 and x^2+y^2+v^2+w^2=0.
While the second hasn't changed, the first becomes y^2=v^2+w^2 when x=0.
Now what?  For example what are the pros and cons of compactly topologizing
the unit sphere y^2+v^2+w^2 <= 1 (not <) when you want to treat the cone
y^2=v^2+w^2 as unreachable from points on either side of it within that
sphere other than through the origin?  What is the physical significance
if any of a path through the origin?

One can always improvise answers but this is a time-consuming and unreliable
process that is greatly inferior to working out of a well-debugged cookbook.

An account of the topology of R(2) addressed to us Bears of Little Brain
would be very helpful.  Everything I've found to date about getting from
quaternions to other Clifford algebras goes straight to arbitrary Clifford
algebras over arbitrary fields, which is about as useful as telling kids
that ice cream comes from dairy farms -- academically interesting but
operationally useless when you just want one ice cream.

Title: Flow does not model flows up to weak dihomotopy

Abstract: We prove that the category of flows cannot be the underlying
category of a model category whose corresponding homotopy types are
the flows up to weak dihomotopy. Some hints are given to overcome this
problem. In particular, a new approach of dihomotopy involving
simplicial presheaves over an appropriate small category is
proposed. This small category is obtained by taking a full subcategory
of a locally presentable version of the category of flows.

Having thought about this consistency issue for the "category of
all categories" from time to time over the years, I had not seen any
satisfactory resolution save that of resolving to stop worrying about it.
But then Sol's talk was advertised for this Thursday, renewing my interest.

One thing was clear: the "category" of all categories is in fact the
2-category 1-CAT (or just CAT) of all categories.  There is no reason
to expect every 2-category to show up in the category of all 1-categories
(though all the large 2-discrete ones will, where "large" is the cardinality
bound for categories).

Furthermore the category n-CAT of all n-categories had to be bigger than any
n-category, since n-categories had no evident property letting one circumvent
Russell's paradox differently from the case n=0 where one concludes that Set
is bigger than any set.  But (n-1)-CAT is an n-category.  Hence we *must*
have a strict hierarchy.

But how much bigger?  Well, certainly an exponential gap between n-CAT and
(n+1)-CAT (meaning the latter being at least the power set of the former)
suffices to dispose of Russell's paradox.

Can one reliably do better and just take *any* strictly increasing
sequence of cardinals?  I'm not sure how one would argue that.
But in any event the cardinals scattered in between the beth numbers
beth_0,beth_1,beth_2,... constituting Cantor's beanstalk are merely nematodes
on the beanstalk produced by the Cohen nematode factory, and it's not clear
to me what additional benefit derives from basing the spacing of the n-CAT
hierarchy on artificially manufactured nematodes.

This is all the more clear when one considers that exponential gaps are
to inaccessible cardinals as nuclear radii are to intergalactic space.
A billion of them, or even epsilon_0 of them, are no more than the layers
creating the iridescence in a butterfly wing.  These are tiny gaps, and it
is pointless trying to shrink them down based on fictional entities if they
can't be shrunk all the way to zero.

It may be distressing that one can't take all n-CAT's to be uniformly the
same size.  But a rate of growth just sufficient to ward off Russell's
paradox is so tiny in the grand scheme of things axiomatized via ZFC,
Grothendieck, or whoever, that one can practically think of them that way.

I can understand that not everyone necessarily cares about cardinality
issues, considering it unhealthy to take them too seriously or examine
them too closely.  Among those on this list that do care, is the above
attitude reasonable?  If so, can it be further elaborated and improved?
If not, what is wrong with it?

                         CALL FOR PAPERS
   9th European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence
                             JELIA'04
                Lisbon, Portugal, September 27-30
             http://centria.di.fct.unl.pt/~jelia2004
       Submission deadline: May 9th (abstracts due May 6th)
/------------------------------------------------------------------/

INTRODUCTION
Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal
basis for the study and development of applications and
systems in Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity
of formalisms, methodologies and logic-based systems today,
this claim is stronger than ever.
The European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (or
Journ=E9es Europ=E9ennes sur la Logique en Intelligence
Artificielle - JELIA) began back in 1988, as a workshop, in
response to the need for a European forum for the discussion
of emerging work in this field. Since then, JELIA has been
organised biennially, with English as official language, and with
proceedings published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in
Artificial Intelligence. Previous meetings took place in Roscoff,
France (1988), Amsterdam, Netherlands (1990), Berlin,
Germany (1992), York, U.K. (1994), =C9vora, Portugal (1996),
Dagstuhl, Germany (1998), M=E1laga, Spain (2000) and Cosenza,
Italy (2002).
The increasing interest in this forum, its international level
with growing participation from researchers outside Europe,
and the overall technical quality, has turned JELIA into a major
biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to
artificial intelligence.

AIM AND SCOPE
The aim of the 9th European Conference on Logics in Artificial
Intelligence, JELIA'04, is to bring together active researchers

Encouraged by the lack of objections to my previous message about why
Russell's Paradox should not be a big deal, I had a shot at shrinking the
position I spelled out there down to one paragraph, as follows.

------------
We shall axiomatize certain 1-categories using 2-categories.  We avoid
Russell's paradox by treating any aggregation of $n$-categories as an
$(n+1)$-category, and allowing for the possibility that the
$(n+1)$-category
$n$-$\CAT$ of all $n$-categories might be exponentially larger than any of
its members.  We impose no other size constraints besides the obvious
one of keeping things small enough to remain consistent.  Sets are defined
as usual as 0-categories and categories as 1-categories.
------------

While I'm happy to field objections like "too flippant", I'm more concerned as
to whether there are any technical flaws, and to a lesser extent philosophical
or religious concerns.  (I would not want to be held responsible for guns
being brought to the next UACT meeting if ever there is one.)

Makkai and Pare address the same issue in AMS CM 104 (Accessible Categories)
with a hierarchy of Grothendieck universes (three, since they like me stop at
2-categories for the application at hand).

Now the Grothendieck hierarchy is stepped through via ZF rather than Z, with
Fraenkel's Replacement axiom doing the heavy hitting.  This creates gaps
mind-bogglingly larger than my teensy exponential gaps above.  The general
idea seems to be that these gaps ought to be large enough to take care of
Russell while still not running headlong into inconsistency.  However gaps
this large do entail a certain amount of finger-crossing, and one might
question the logic of hitting Russell with a nuclear weapon that might send
some fallout your way when a harmless little tack-hammer will take him out.

One objection I can readily imagine to the above is that I've conflated
the n-category hierarchy with Russell's proposal for a ramified types
hierarchy.  I would disagree with that.  All I have done is to insist
on two things that seem to me to be independent.

1.  I have proposed to call aggregations of n-categories (n+1)-categories.
Now morphisms between n-categories are n-functors, and where there are
n-functors there are n-natural transformations, so this is hardly a bold
proposal.

2.  *Some* gap is needed between n-CAT and (n+1)-CAT, starting with the
requirement that Set be bigger than any set.  Russell's paradox is no
respecter of n, applying just as effectively to an (n+1)-category of
n-categories as it does to a 1-category of sets.

Certainly I have juxtaposed 1 and 2, but that is not the same thing as
conflating them.  Their mere juxtaposition provides sufficient armor
against both Russell's paradox and the Icarus risk of flying too close to
an inconsistently large cardinal.

The "prior art" for dealing with these issues has given rise to the adjectives
"small", "large," "superlarge", etc. and the nouns "set" and "class."
A good test for any revolution is the amount of blood it needs to shed.
The following definitions are aimed at minimal upheaval through maximum
compatibility with the status quo.

* An object is n-small when it belongs to an n-category.

* Small = 1-small, large = 2-small, superlarge = 3-small, etc.

* A set is a discrete 1-category.

* A class is a discrete n-category for unspecified n.

Hopefully Sol Feferman will give an even simpler solution in his talk
tomorrow.

i think the question of foundations needs to be considered together with
the meta-question: why working mathematicians don't care for foundations?

a trivial part of the answer is that it's a matter of taste: some people
organize their diet following the pyramid of "so much fruit so much
vegetables so much meat", other people smoke and drink coffee and eat
chocolate.

the less trivial part of the answer is that the world of working
mathematics is not built on top of a static foundation. the questions
and the meta-questions are asked together. categories are foundations of
categories.

russell's paradox and hilbert's idea that math should have a static
foundation are old. a lot has happened. sets are not so rigid any more.
starting from models of untyped lambda calculus, people built all kinds
of reflective universes, even containing small complete categories. the
category of small categories can probably be a small 2-category in such
a universe.

the set of all sets can hardly be a set because of the variance, but i
think that the set of all sets of sets can be a set in some models.

Just for the record, the change I requested was from "discrete
1-category" to just "0-category" without the "discrete" (being redundant).

And this is the line in question:

Just to check, the word "discrete" here is redundant, right?
You just put it in to contrast with the next line, where it's necessary:

>* A class is a discrete n-category for unspecified n.

very simple anwer:

foundations is just an area within mathematics

the working mathemeticians who care about foundations are those who work
in foundations

why do not ask the question:

"why working mathematicians don't care for ring theory?"

well, because we think that those who work in ring theory are working
mathematicians

but there are a lot who do not work in ring theory, and do not care
either

for foundations it is the same thing

why we give foundations a different status ?

I'm not entirely sure I follow what Vaughan's project is here, so this
may come out as a non sequitur, but:  Surely, from time to time,
categorists must care about genuinely ultra-first-order notions, such as
(say) the metric completeness of the real numbers?  To me the natural
way of getting such notions right is to make sure that each of your
universes is closed under the (true) powerset operation.  That would
require the cardinality of your universes to be, at least, strong limit
cardinals.

Having them closed under ranges of functions also seems natural enough;
at that point you need inaccessibles.

It's by no means clear that inaccessibles are sufficient.  What happens

At some point I'll try to collect my thoughts on Sol Feferman's Thursday
lecture on his alternative to Grothendieck universes, which he objected to
as entailing an infinity of inaccessible cardinals.  (What was Grothendieck's
view of inaccessible cardinals vis a vis his universes?)

During the lecture it struck me that his approach was quite like Robinson's
approach to infinitesimals, in that it constructed lots of models of what
was needed, took the common theory, then constructed a single model from
the many, using techniques of Vaught and others to avoid losing too much
of the common spirit of the many guided by the common theory (not sure if
that captures the idea completely faithfully, but it's something like that).

Thus distracted, I found myself wondering yet again why the d^2 = 0 property
was so difficult for an infinitesimal d.  Having been mulling over the
quaternions lately, it seemed to me there was something of an analogy there,
some property so built into our very psyche that we can't let go of it.
Hamilton finally dropped commutativity, along with any reservations he
might have harbored about vandalizing stone bridges in his own town.

For the quaternions, d^2 = 0 implies d = 0, so this doesn't help.  However the
quaternions have a sibling algebra, just as noncommutative, and of exactly
the same vector space dimension (in fact the only Clifford such, i.e. the
only other real 4D vector space for which ij+ji=0 for all orthogonal vectors
i,j having no real component), that is even better known than the quaternions
(imagine that).

Namely the Clifford algebra of 2x2 real matrices, as a 4D real vector space,
made an algebra with matrix multiplication.

Why not model d as the matrix
0 1
0 0?

This is a perfectly good quantity, adding and scaling just like any
real, e.g. 2d =
0 2
0 0.

And obviously d^2 = 0.

Standard reals x would have the form

x 0
0 x

1+d would therefore be

1 1
0 1

(1+d)^2 then becomes

1 2
0 1

as common sense would indicate.

The determinant of d being 0, one can't divide by it.  But who in their
right mind would want to divide by a quantity infinitesimally close to zero?
Obviously that's going to produce an infinitely large quantity; if you want
to do that, why not just go ahead and divide by zero itself?  As Douglas
Adams pointed out, you may think the store down the road is a fair way away,
but other galaxies are even further away.  To a nematode they're all far away.

On the other hand
1 2
0 1
has a perfectly good reciprocal, namely
1 -2
0 1
again as suggested by common sense.

So the proposal is to base calculus on a field-like object that is a field
in the large, but zero divide errors set in when one gets infinitesimally
close to zero.  Basically what happens with IEEE floating point arithmetic,
but modeled with 2x2 real matrices rather than 64-bit numbers.

Oh, but what about the noncommutativity of 2x2 matrices, might that mess
something up?

Actually no, this two-dimensional algebra consisting of matrices of the form
a b
0 a
is commutative.  So only the zero divisors really close to 0 constitute
any departure at all from the field axioms.

The diagonal element a is the standard real part and the off-diagonal
element b in the upper right gives the infinitesimal displacement.

So we have a real commutative associative algebra of refined numbers,
having a real part and an infinitesimal part, whose only zero divisors are
the infinitesimals.  We don't *have* to think of them as matrices because
we can just write its elements as x+yd by analogy with x+iy, where d is
the above matrix representing the prototypical infinitesimal.  The square
of i is -1, and the square of d is 0.

Moreover x and y in x+yd can be complex.  We then have numbers x+iy+ud+ivd,
which can parsed as either refined complex numbers, namely complex numbers
with refined coefficients x+ud+i(y+vd), or complex refined numbers, namely
refined numbers with complex coefficients x+iy+(u+iv)d.  This is still a
real associative algebra, which through force of habit people will no doubt
want to call a complex commutative associative algebra, but it could just
as legitimately be called a refined associative algebra.

Ok, what about commutative?  Well, the complex numbers are commutative and
the refined numbers are commutative, so how could refining complex numbers
make any difference?

Well, the reason I wrote x+yd rather than x+dy is that, even though the
*natural* thing to do is to make i commute with d, if instead we make
id+di=0, the defining condition for Clifford algebras, then we can fit the
whole thing into 2x2 *real* matrices!

Here I'm using the following 2x2 real matrices for i and d respectively:

(0 -1) (0 1)
(1  0) (0 0)

But now notice that the matrices for 1,i,d,id form a basis for all the
2x2 matrices.  In fact *any* 2x2 matrix [[a,b],[c,d]] can be decomposed as

(d -c) + (a-d b+c)
(c  d)   ( 0   0 )

(I'd appreciate feedback from anyone for whom the above doesn't typeset
readably.)

So to read an arbitary 2x2 real matrix as a refined complex number, take the
bottom row reversed as the complex part and the departure of the top row from
the usual matrix representation of complex numbers as the infinitesimal part,
taking care to get both signs right.

How did I notice this?  Simple.  I knew (i) that id+di=0 would make it a
Clifford algebra, (ii) there are only two 4D Clifford algebras, and (iii) d^2
= 0 -> d = 0 in the quaternions.  This narrows things down to the 2x2 real
matrices, there are no other associative algebras with these properties.
Getting the above decomposition was then just a matter of solving some
trivial linear equations.

This is so simple, and the infinitesimals have been worried at for so long,
that this *has* to be known already.  But then it would really bug me to
have been the last to learn about it -- why wasn't I told, as they say?

Correction to my suggestion id+di = 0.  Don't do it.  id = di is fine
as it stands for refined complex numbers, which should be represented in
C(2) = 2x2 complex matrices (embeddable in R(4) - 4x4 real matrices)
as the obvious extension of the refined reals x+yd.

I shouldn't have been so smug about 4D Clifford algebras, this algebra of
refined complex numbers doesn't satisfy d^4 = 1, needed if d is to be a
Clifford generator.

And in fact although di =
1 0
0 0
we have id =
0 0
0 1
(I should have checked that more carefully.)

I thought about trying to make the infinitesimals points on the "light cone"
of R(2) (the singular matrices) but couldn't get that to work.  So 2x2
complex matrices with id = di is the best I could think of.  This works
for modeling the refined complex numbers (barring any other errors), but
with nothing left to motivate  id+di = 0.

The representation x+iy+dv+idw is fine, with idw = diw = wid etc., all is
commutative.  (I was hoping too hard for the excitement of noncommutativity,
this is boringly noninteractive as it stands.)

I'm told that Bell's "microlinear calculus" in his 1998 book on infinitesimals
is equivalent to the matrix approach I suggested, so that was not new after
all, other than perhaps its formulation in terms of 2x2 matrices.

On the other hand it is apparently mixed in with Bell's strongly
intuitionistic outlook, whereas it would seem intuitively that something
so simple as a model of d^2 = 0 should transcend whether one is working
intuitionistically or classically.  A more classical version of Bell's account
might be of interest (perhaps to relatively few people on the categories
mailing list though, which seems to have a strongly intuitionistic slant).

Meanwhile I received the April issue of Mathematics Magazine just now, and it
has an article on pp. 118-129 on "Geometry of Generalized Complex Numbers"
by Anthony and Joseph Harkin.  The microlinear calculus, under the names
"Study product" and "parabolic complex numbers," apparently dates back
to Study's 1903 book Geometrie der Dynamen.  The Harkins associate i^2 =
-1,0,1 with respectively Ordinary (i.e. complex) product, Study product,
and Clifford product (though Clifford algebras include ordinary product as
well, the quaternions being a Clifford algebra).

The article makes no mention of infinitesimals, and it would be interesting to
try to find the appropriate infinitesimal interpretations of the geometric
properties of the parabolic complex plane.

One approach I very much like to infinitesimals that I haven't seen in the
nonstandard analysis/infinitesimal literature (but would certainly appreciate
pointers) is one that does all the work with what one might call finitesimals.
A finitesimal h is just a positive real that you plan one day to reduce to
zero, and thus organize everything around it to that end.

Polynomials in R[x] of degree d form a (d+1)-dimensional vector space.
The usual basis for this space is the d+1 monomials x^i for i in 0..d.
However if one fixes h > 0 and takes the basis to be 1, x, x(x-h),
x(x-h)(x-2h),... then Boole's difference calculus works essentially
identically to the infinitesimal calculus for polynomials represented in
the monomial basis.  Since h is a free variable throughout the development,
one can do all the work first and then drive h to 0 uniformly everywhere
at the end.  Expressions such as x^i (Knuth writes an underbar under the i
and calls it "x to the falling i") mention h only implicitly and hence don't
change (as symbolic expressions) as h changes, though their numerical values
at any given x change.  The Stirling numbers of the first and second kind,
organized as matrices, constitute linear transformations from the bases
for h=1 to h=0 and back again, respectively.

I've looked from time to time at how one might extend this to exponentials
and logarithms, but have never been satisfied with the results.  It would be
nice to know how to deal exactly with exp(it) for nonzero h.  If this were
possible it might give an even nicer constructive treatment of infinitesimals
than the others, and one that didn't care at all whether one was classically
or intuitionistically inclined.

Yes, which was why I formulated the exponential gap only as a lower bound.
The idea was that if you needed more, take it.

In retrospect I should have included the Russell paradox, viewed
constructively as a set factory rather than mysteriously as a bogeyman
under the bed, as something one might or might not need for some purpose,
e.g. as a successor function.  This reclassification (as a shift only in my
personal outlook) prompts me to withdraw my suggestion (made as much for
my benefit as anyone's but as such good to bounce off people) of imposing
any lower bound at all on size of gaps between successive n-CAT categories.

Size can certainly be an issue, whether involving rates of growth of functions
on the integers, or large cardinals.  In their CM104 book, Makkai and Pare
treat the first order model theory (as opposed to first order logic) of
accessible categories, where the goal is to characterize the behavior of
categories independently of their size as far as possible, and where not
possible to characterize the dependencies on size.  Such an enterprise is
not ordinary mathematics but foundations, and as such is *about* these gaps.
Their results (presumably with the help of a consultant) should allow those
on the consuming side of foundations, i.e. those doing ordinary mathematics
(if there really is such a thing), to judge for themselves whether a given
construction is in danger of colliding with a size paradox.  One would hope
that a few simple rules of thumb would minimize dependence on consultants,
though it did not seem to me that CM104 was organized with that economy
clearly in mind; this might be corrected with a short cheat sheet as an
addendum.

Not all paradoxes concern size.  The liar paradox and the
division-by-infinitesimal paradoxes can be turned into size paradoxes via
a suitable encoding, but they are not intrinsically size-related; well,
in the case of infinitesimals, not large sizes anyway.

Perhaps it just reflects my old-fashioned upbringing, but the foundational
role intended for CM104 is way clearer to me than any of the several topos
texts currently scattered around my desk.  Not with regard to the definitions,
examples, and (to the extent I understand their motivation) the theorems
of topos theory.  The elementary definition of a topos is crystal clear
(not to mention incredibly beautiful), as are the basic examples of toposes.

Where I run into problems is in placing topos theory as a foundation beside
say accessible categories.  I can go repeatedly through the topos texts
and just not get it.  Is there some finely honed sentence or paragraph that
explains this relationship?

I get the feeling there should be a sentence or paragraph to the effect that
one brings size under control (or makes it a non-issue) by passing from the
external logic of accessible categories to the internal logic of toposes.
Is some such clear and succinct story (not necessarily that one since it
might be totally wrong) told somewhere?  If so, one could deal with idiots
like me who rant about size as an issue by pointing them at that story,
by way of indicating how to stop worrying about inaccessible cardinals
by embracing someone else's internal logic (and making it one's own?).
Or whatever the story actually is.

What about Remark 7.1.14 in Paul Taylor's Practical Mathematics, for example?
Is this tangential, on point, or core?  What about the preface to Borceux'
Volume 3?  Does Peter Johnstone's nonconstructive theorem "There exists
an elephant" in his preface have a succinctly summarized constructive
counterpart somewhere, a sort of sharply focused photo of an elephant taken
from 50 feet away?  (Actually I suppose a sharply focused photo of a real
elephant would have very close to the same number of megabytes of data as
in the two volumes, so maybe I mean an elephant icon.)

Or is this all just a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the real
goals of topos theory, with the truth being that there is ultimately no
way mathematicians can avoid large cardinals if they expect to be able to
prove certain theorems, even those of an ostensibly combinatorial flavor?
This is certainly the sermon that Harvey Friedman has been preaching for
a number of years; is Harvey wrong about this?

There seem to be some sunglasses and rose-colored glasses lying around but
I can't tell who they belong to.  Surely they're not all mine.

After calculating the group extensions of Z+Z by Z, with constant action, I
am curious whether the groups have any more natural form than I found.  I
mean extension of Z+Z by Z in this sense, as a sequence of groups where E
need not be commutative:

    0 --> Z --> E --> Z+Z --> 0

and the kernel is in the center of E.

The form I found is parametrized by the integers this way:  For any integer
c, the group E_c has triples of integers (i,,j,k) as elements and the
multiplication rule is coordinate-wise addition plus an extra bit in the
first coordinate.

(i,,j,k).(q,r,s) =  ( (i+j+c.(kr)), j+r, k+s)

When c=0 this is commutative and is just the coproduct Z+Z+Z.  In any group
E_c, the element (c,0,0) is the commutator of (0,0,1) and (0,1,0).  The
Baer sum of extensions corresponds to addition of the parameters c as
integers.  So I understand the group of extensions.  Of course I understood
it before I calculated it, since it is the second cohomology group of the
torus.  That is why I tried the algebraic calculation.

But is there a natural way to think about each group E_c, for non-zero
values of c?  Do these groups appear in any other natural way?

thanks, colin

Well, you're not alone in thinking that way.  This was the basis for
Robinson's invention of nonstandard analysis: the belief that a/b has to
be defined for all nonzero b in order to make infinitesimals nonparadoxical.

Instead of formulating division a/b as an operation, go back to its motivating
formulation as a system in search of a solution, in this case the system
consisting of the one linear equation a = bx in one unknown.

Had the system been one of ordinary or partial differential equations,
there would be no argument that the solution space could turn out quite
oddly shaped.

Now when a and b are reals the solution space is a rectangle: only the
column indexed by b=0 is undefined.  This remains true when a and b are
extended to the complex numbers, or even to the quaternions.

But if you extend the domain to the algebra R(2) of 2x2 real matrices,
the columns indexed by singular matrices now lose some of their entries.
But not all, and so the solution space ceases to be rectangular.

Robinson believed that the way to make infinitesimals safe for analysis was
to make the solution space for a = bx rectangular.  Today's logicians are
magicians with logic: if logic indicates the impossibility of a rectangular
solution space, no need to abandon that goal, just bend logic until the
solution space does become rectangular.  The students will bend with you,
at least those who've approached nonstandard analysis with the proper
upbeat spirit about how much simpler analysis becomes when infinitesimals
can be objectified.  Power tools are wonderful.

To answer your question (or comment), in the system of refined numbers I
described, if b is infinitesimal and nonzero, a = bx is solvable if and only
if a is infinitesimal.  The division table is no longer rectangular.  So what?

One might grumble that a = bx can't have an infinitesimal part when a and
b are both infinitesimals, but in the simple cases that's a plus.  In more
complicated cases, 2x2 matrices aren't enough, you need nxn matrices,
with distance of nonzero entries from the diagonal measuring the degree
of their infinitesimality (if that's a word).  In this case d^n = 0 only
for higher n's.

After thinking along those lines for a bit more the other day, I decided
that even though I liked this approach better than throwing ultrafilters at
it, it still wasn't as good as doing analysis in Boole's finite difference
calculus with h remaining unbound throughout, the approach I'd used since the
early 1970's.  That approach has the great advantage of being able to use the
same analysis in classical and quantum physics by setting h=0 to interpret a
result classically and setting it to Planck's constant to interpret the same
result quantumly.  As a case in point, the same integration formulas can
deliver areas under smooth curves and discrete summations of e.g. n^3, the
latter with h=1. (I already wrote a bit about that two or three messages ago.)

The right power tools are even more wonderful.

Anyone who's subscribed to this list long enough knows that I've been
sufficiently bothered by the disjunction "Sets or categories" as to pester
the list with my botherment periodically.  I bothered the FOM mailing list
with the same question for some years, with rather less civilized responses
on occasion -- that was quite a wild list for a while, but Martin Davis
seems to have done a good job of stabilizing it, too late unfortunately for
those of us who found the repartee counterproductive and moved on before
his administration.

My pestering is not so much to make a nuisance of myself as to get a
satisfactory answer.  So far the answers, on either side, have struck me
as entailing a certain acceptance of the local lore and wisdom bordering
on religion.

I would like to propose a middle ground on which set theorists and
category theorists can meet amicably.  The middle ground is expressed by
the proposition O=H, that objects and homobjects are of the same type.

One of "mathematics" or "short" is defined by the proposition that all
short definitions have been made, all short questions asked already, and
all short theorems either previously proved or now famous open problems.

Before pursuing this line of thought any further I'd like to ask whether
O=H is short in the above sense.  Has it been brought up before, and if so
what are the prevailing views on it?

Try the Heisenberg group of upper triangular matrices with 1's on the
diagonal and the integers i,j,k in the upper non diagonal entries.

1   k   i
0   1   j
0   0   1

This should give the case c=1, but your formula is not quite correct as the
RHS does not involve q.

Should it be q + j + c.(kr)?

===================================================================
                           CoLoPS 2004

                     International Workshop on

            COnstraint & LOgic Programming in Security

             December 5-11th, 2004 - Saint-Malo, France
                  Satellite Workshop to ICLP 2004
====================================================================

Scope of the workshop:

Due to its practical relevance and complexity, the study of security
has become a serious challenge involving several disciplines of
computer science. A noteworthy aspect is that in several instances
this study has used directly or indirectly tools and techniques from
(Concurrent) Constraint Programming and (Linear) Logic
Programming. For example, constraint solving has successfully been
used for verifying security protocols, and several process algebras
for modelling cryptographic protocols (e.g., recent variants of the
spi calculus, SPL) have remarkable similarities with Concurrent
Constraint Programming. Also (Linear) Logic Programming has been used
as a framework for security protocols, and one of its central notions,
unification, has been used for the symbolic execution of cryptographic
calculi.

CoLoPS aims at getting a broader perspective on the role of Constraint
and Logic Programming in the study of security. Topics of interest
include (but are not restricted to) frameworks for security using
algorithms, verification techniques, process algebras or programming
languages, with a Constraint or Logic Programming flavor.

On reflection this is not so simple in the case when b in a/b is
infinitesimal.  First, noting that R(2) is noncommutative, the requirement
should be phrased as two equations, a = bx and a = xb to prevent multiple
solutions whose diagonal is not constant.

But while this duplication then determines a unique real part (the diagonal),
the two equations fail to pin down the infinitesimal part (the upper right
entry).  That's the sort of thing that happens with matrices of less than
full rank.

When there is no solution, certainly a/b should be considered undefined.
But when there are multiple solutions, the question arises as to whether to
punt completely (as with 0/0) or do something creative such as setting the
undefined infinitesimal part to 0 (as with the ratio of two infinitesimals).

One test is whether the "dominant" term is fixed, but this breaks down
for 0/b.

A better test would be to use the rank of b to decide how much of the
quotient a/b to ignore---if b has rank 1 (a nonzero infinitesimal) then
ignore the infinitesimal part of a/b.

---------------

One virtue of Robinson's approach is its universality with respect to all
first-order definable functions; this however is not sufficient to compensate
for its more counterintuitive aspects.  Now that I'm starting to see that
the zero-divisor approach is less easily managed than I'd first thought,
I'm not so sold on it either at this point (but maybe all its difficulties
have been overcome somewhere...?).

Meanwhile I remain convinced that Boole's finite difference approach to
handling infinitesimals is superior (recall the trick here: setting h=0
instead of some positive quantity like 1 or Planck's constant introduces no
artificial singularities with Boole's method).  His 1860 *A Treatise on the
Calculus of Finite Differences," substantially revised by J.F. Moulton for
the 1872 edition after Boole's death, is 336 pages of inspired analysis.
(You can get second hand copies for $10 from Amazon; my very second hand
copy has "F.S. Curry, Trin. Coll., Feb. 1881" written on the inside cover.)

The preface to the first edition starts out,

"In the following exposition of the Calculus of Finite Differences,
particular attention has been paid to the connexion of its methods with
those of the Differential Calculus---a connexion which in some instances
involves far more than a merely formal analogy.

Indeed the work is in some measure designed as a sequel to my *Treatise
on Differential Equations*.  And it has been composed on the same plan."

An updated version of this book incorporating the greatly matured perspective
on linear algebra since then could be a worthwhile project for someone
interested in improving on the existing explications of infinitesimals as
real objects.  While Boole's system beats the current crop hands down in
principle (in my view anyway), in outlook it is showing its age.

Category theory creatively applied might also help.  I confess to having no
idea how intuitionistic logic could be brought to bear effectively though.
I can see that not cancelling certain double negations might preserve certain
nuances that convey certain constructively motivated notions, but to my
untrained eye these come across as nuances with a capital N when their
contribution is assessed in the larger picture of alternative approaches
to constructivizing infinitesimals.  That makes me either a beer guzzler
at a wine tasting or the owner of a screwdriver in a room full of hammer
owners depending on one's outlook.  :)

The name "Heisenberg" hints that anyone with a physics bone
in their body can't resist thinking about this sort of extension
in terms of quantum mechanics.   In this context, the constant
that parametrizes the central extension, which Colin and Ronnie
are calling "c", is called "Planck's constant", or "hbar" for short.

The original Heisenberg groups were the central extensions of R^2
by U(1) (the unit complex numbers).  To get these, we represent
any element (a,b) in R^2 as a unitary operator on L^2(R):

U(a,b) = exp(iaq + ibp)

where q and p are the self-adjoint "position" and "momentum" operators
on L^2(R):

q = multiplication by x
p = -i hbar d/dx

These unitary operators U(a,b) fail to commute because

[p,q] = - i hbar

so the group they generate is not R^2, except in the "classical"
case where hbar = 0.  Instead, they generate a group of operators
that is a central extension of R^2 by U(1).

We get all the central extensions of R^2 by U(1) this way.
Central extensions of R^2 by R work similarly; you get one
for each real number hbar.

Apparently central extensions of Z^2 by Z also work similarly!

Best,
jb

Part of this idea is implicit in the usual algebraic geometry treatment
of infinitesimals as nilpotents.  In addition to the usual "point", such
that complex functions on this space form the commutative ring C, algebraic
geometers like to think about the "point with nth-order nilpotent fuzz",
such that complex functions on this space form the commutative ring
C[d]/<d^n = 0>.   They visualize this as a space slightly bigger than
a point: just big enough to tell the difference between the function 0
and the function whose first n-1 derivatives equal zero!

To deal with this sort of "space" in a precise way, someone like Grothendieck
invented the category of affine schemes, which is just the opposite of the
category of commutative rings.  But affine schemes are happier as part of a
larger category of schemes... and thus topos theory was brought kicking
and screaming into the world.  To see how this led to a really nice treatment
of infinitesimals, see:

F. William Lawvere, Outline of synthetic differential geometry, available
at http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/downloadlist.html

or

Anders Kock, Synthetic Differential Geometry, Cambridge U. Press,
Cambridge, 1981.

But, it's also tempting to embed the commutative ring C[d]/<d^n = 0> into
the noncommutative ring of nxn complex matrices, by letting d be a
slightly off-diagonal matrix, like this:

0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0                    (in the case n = 4)
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0

(Vaughan is considering the case n = 2.)  And this is more like how
Alain Connes thinks of infinitesimals: as part of the bigger world of
noncommutative geometry!

I'm looking for language advice on dealing with the following "St. Ives"
problem, as a 2-categorical down-sizing of the 4-categorical original.

I have a 2-category CAT^{\pm} (arising from a 2-monad C\pm1 analogous to
the monad X+1) that is disconnected in the sense that it is representable
as a sum of connected 2-categories.  Each summand has homcats that are
similarly disconnected, being representable as a sum of connected homcats.

If I take a summand 2-category, and from each of its homcats coherently
take a summand 1-category, I end up with a 2-category with an initial and
a final category serving as respectively the syntax and the semantics of
a certain 2-theory (of linearly distributive but not self-dual categories
of dually typed objects, but that's another story I'm hoping Myles Tierney
will like better than the Chu story).

I don't think it's caused by my doing anything wrong--the situation appears
to have arisen naturally and I've found no way of making it go away.

Has this situation arisen before?  If so, what is the proposed terminology
for this kind of finality and its associated uniqueness?  If not, I'm happy
to make up my own conventions, but I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.

I've often come across such central extensions when studying various
topics in algebra.  For reasons which are obvious from the messages of
Ronnie Brown and John Baez, I've been calling such extensions "Heisenberg
extensions".

The general construction is the following: Let  A  and  C  be abelian
groups, and  f:AxA ----> C  be bilinear.  Then  f  is a  2-cocycle for the
trivial action of  A  on  C, and the corresponding central extension has
the form  E = CxA  with composition law given by the usual formula:
(c,a)(c',a') = (c+c'+f(a,a'), a+a').  The classes of such extensions form
a subgroup of the group of all classes of central extensions of  A  by  C,
but in general is not the whole group.  If  C  is uniquely divisible by
2,
then these extensions have the property that they split over every cyclic
subgroup of  A.

The analogous construction for finite group schemes plays a role in
certain questions in Galois theory and related matters; see, e.g., my
paper, "On a variant of the Witt and Brauer groups", in "Brauer Groups
(Evanston 1975)", Springer LNM 549 (pp 148-187).  Also, relatively free
groups for certain varieties of nilpotent groups of class  2  can be
constructed as Heisenberg extensions.  In particular, the integral
Heisenberg group is the  2-generator relatively free group for the variety
of all nilpotent groups of class 2.

After calculating the group extensions of Z+Z by Z, with constant action,
I am curious whether the groups have any more natural form than I found.
I mean extension of Z+Z by Z in this sense, as a sequence of groups where
E need not be commutative:

    0 --> Z --> E --> Z+Z --> 0

and the kernel is in the center of E.

The form I found is parametrized by the integers this way:  For any
integer c, the group E_c has triples of integers (i,,j,k) as elements and
the multiplication rule is coordinate-wise addition plus an extra bit in
the first coordinate.

(i,,j,k).(q,r,s) =  ( (i+j+c.(kr)), j+r, k+s)

When c=0 this is commutative and is just the coproduct Z+Z+Z.  In any
group E_c, the element (c,0,0) is the commutator of (0,0,1) and (0,1,0).
The Baer sum of extensions corresponds to addition of the parameters c as
integers.  So I understand the group of extensions.  Of course I
understood it before I calculated it, since it is the second cohomology
group of the torus.  That is why I tried the algebraic calculation.

But is there a natural way to think about each group E_c, for non-zero
values of c?  Do these groups appear in any other natural way?

thanks, colin
