Arithmetic Universes and Abstract Stone Duality  --  Paul Taylor
            www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pt/ASD

(a) Inside every model of Abstract Stone Duality lies an Arithmetic Universe
(b) Every Arithmetic Universe is embedded in a model of Abstract Stone Duality.

The first is the title of a new draft paper, available from the web
page above, on which your comments are invited.  I haven't written up
the second, but the essence of the argument follows below.

The "embedding" in question is (up to equivalence) as exactly the
full subcategory of overt discrete objects.

ABSTRACT of (a):
    The first paper published on Abstract Stone Duality showed that
    the overt discrete objects (those admitting  exists  and  equality
    internally) form a pretopos, ie admit finite limits, stable disjoint
    coproducts and stable effective quotients of equivalence relations.

    Using an N-indexed least fixed point axiom, here we show that this
    full subcategory is an arithmetic universe, having a free semilattice
    (KX, "collection of Kuratowski-finite subsets") and a free monoid
    (List X, "collection of lists") on any overt discrete object.

    Each finite subset is represented by its pair ([], <>) of modal
    operators (although a tight correspondence with these depends
    on a stronger Scott-continuity axiom).  Topologically, such subsets
    are both compact and open and also involve proper open maps.
    In applications of ASD this can eliminate lists in favour of
    a continuation-passing interpretation.

The three aspects of the paper to which I would like to draw your
attention are:

    The use of modal operators is related to the three powerdomains
    (in particular to the Plotkin or convex one) in domain theory.
    The construction itself is a domain-theoretic one, as the object KX
    is constructed by means of an idempotent that is the solution of
    a fixed point equation.  A novel induction principle is needed
    to prove the modal laws from the fixed point equation.

    The final section shows how KX is a "finite powerset" in that it
    classifies Kuratowski-finite subsets or compact open subspaces of X.
    More generally, maps Gamma->KX correspond to open relations
    U subset Gamma x X for which U->Gamma is proper.

    As this paper is the first serious use of internal induction and
    recursion in ASD, it forced me to reconsider the definition of the
    natural numbers object in this category without arbitrary equalisers
    (cf my message to "categories" on 4 November).  Proof-theoretically,
    this means that the judgements in the ASD lambda-calculus must allow
    equations as well as assignments of types to variables as
    hypotheses.  Topologically, this may provide a way of extending ASD
    from locally compact locales to all locales (but as several previous
    attempts to do this have failed, I'm making no promises here).

THE CONVERSE (b) - embedding a given AU in a model of ASD.

There are numerous constructions and characterisations of categories of
domains using "bases", "information systems", "approximable relations"
etc., most notably that in Dana Scott's 1982 "Domains for Denotational
Semantics" that defined what have since become known as Scott domains.

In these, each domain is encoded as a set of tokens, possibly with
other structure such as a closure condition, and each continuous
function is encoded as a relation between tokens.

Although these constructions were almost invariably presented in very
concrete language with "set" meaning "set", the categorically astute
observer will notice that they need far less than full set theory in
the metalanguage. In fact they require
 - cartesian products (products)
 - sets of solutions of equations (equalisers)
 - disjoint unions (extensivity - stable disjoint coproducts)
 - relations considered as a notion of function
     (regularity - stable image factorisation)
 - relations considered as a notion of equality
     (exactness - stable effective quotients of equivalence relations)
 - definition by description and
 - recursion over lists (free monoids),
where the formal categorical names are given in brackets for the various
notions that are to be found in a first year "Discrete Math" course.

All but the last define a PRETOPOS, and including the last we have
an ARITHMETIC UNIVERSE (AU).

One way to construct a model of ASD around an AU would be as the
category of "abstract bases" and "abstract matrices" defined in my
paper "Computably based locally compact spaces".  (My abstract bases
are similar to the "strong proximity lattices" used by Achim Jung
and others to characterise stably locally compact spaces.)

However, such a construction would be rather difficult - and
unnecessarily so, as "Subspaces in ASD" already provides a general way
of adding the monadic property to a given category that has powers of
an object Sigma.

All we need, therefore, is a category in which the given AU embeds
as a full subcategory, in which there are powers of an object Sigma.

In classical terms, a suitable such category would be that of disjoint
unions of algebraic lattices, with Scott-continuous maps.  For
convenience, we call such a disjoint union a "predomain".

An "information system" construction would encode a predomain as a
family of sets of tokens, each set being equipped with a finitary
closure relation.  The members of the family correspond to the
components of the disjoint union. A "family of sets" can be encoded in
an AU as a single morphism, and a relation as a subobject.  The
morphisms are "approximable relations", which are also encoded as
subobjects.

This category has finite products and stable disjoint coproducts, and
the given AU is embedded as a full subcategory: an object N of the AU
becomes the predomain encoded as the N-indexed family of empty sets
(the morphism 0->N).  Sigma is encoded as the family consisting of a
single singleton (the morphism 1->1). The exponential Sigma^X exists
for any predomain X, encoded as the family whose one member is the set
of finite sets of tokens of X - this is where the free semilattice
comes in.

One striking but actually very simple property of this category
of predomains is that Sigma classifies subobjects in the AU:

    U ----> 1
    v  |    |
    |---    | top
    |   |
    v   v
    N ----> Sigma

That is, Sigma has exactly the defining property of a subobject
classifier (Omega), as if the AU were an elementary topos - except
that the object Sigma belongs to the larger category of predomains,
not to the given AU.  This property is achieved by the same sleight of
hand that often makes category theory so powerful - we may encode
objects and morphisms of a category as we please, in this case as
subobjects (it would be better to say monomorphisms) of a given category.

Besides having powers of Sigma and embedding the AU exactly as its
full subcategory of overt discrete objects, the category of predomains
obeys the Phoa principle, its morphisms are all Scott continuous and
its objects are Sigma-split subspaces of Sigma^N.  Its "monadic
completion" (using "Subspaces in ASD") is therefore exactly the
kind of category that is discussed in "Computably based locally
compact spaces".

In particular, no new overt discrete objects are added by these
constructions: the given AU is embedded (up to equivalence) as
exactly the full subcategory of overt discrete objects.


It seems to me that the "equivalence" between AUs and ASD that is
established by these two results should be very significant.  Andre'
Joyal originally introduced AUs because they are the minimal natural
categorical structure in which one can form the free internal thing of
the same kind.  Since any AU can be embedded in a model of ASD, we can
use domain theoretic methods (of which my new paper is a clumsy simple
example) to construct free internal algebras (including free
categories) and cofree internal coalgebras.  The semantics of WHILE
programs given in "first order" terms using coequalisers in Section
6.4 of "Practical Foundations" is really the same thing as the better
known "higher order" domain-theoretic fixed point semantics. On the
other hand, we may construct the free internal AU as a subcategory of
the free internal model of ASD.

UNIVERSITY OF DURHAM

DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE

4 Lecturer Posts

Up to 4 appointments will be made at the level of Lecturer.  It is
expected that applicants will range from young researchers who have just
completed their PhDs through to established academics with
internationally-leading research profiles.  Common to all appointments
will be a high quality research portfolio or demonstrable potential of
such.  All positions are tenable from 1st September 2004 or from a
mutually acceptable date thereafter.

Further particulars can be obtained from the University's jobs pages at:

https://jobs.dur.ac.uk/home.asp

The Department of Computer Science has recently appointed 8 new members
of academic staff, 7 of whom are due to arrive in Durham in summer 2004
and 1 at a later date (see http://www.durham.ac.uk/computer.science for
more details).  This second phase of our recruitment will take the
number of full-time permanent academic staff up to 20, with the
intention being to increase this number to 25 by 2006.

The appointments will be split across the 2 research groups, which are
Theoretical Computer Science, and Software Engineering and Distributed
Systems. 2 Lectureships will support the new Professor of Computer
Science, Professor Hajo Broersma, and 2 Lectureships will support the
Software Engineering and Distributed Systems research group.

As regards the 2 Lectureships in Theoretical Computer Science,
applications are welcomed from candidates with research interests
ranging across the subject, but applications are particularly encouraged
from candidates with research interests in: algorithmic graph theory;
computational complexity; graph theory and combinatorics; communications
networks; and probabilistic and randomised algorithms.

As regards the 2 Lectureships in Software Engineering and Distributed
Computing, applications are welcomed from candidates whose research
interests lie within the broad area covered by these subjects. However,
applicants with research interests in visualisation and distributed
architectures as they relate to e-Science or in inter-disciplinary
applications are particular welcome.

Applicants unsure as to whether their research expertise falls under
that described above are encouraged to informally contact Professor Iain
Stewart who can provide advice and guidance.

As mentioned earlier, the first phase of our reorganisation commenced
with the advertisement of positions in October 2003.  Given that about 7
months have elapsed since then and previous applicants personal details
may have changed considerably in that time, previous applicants for the
positions advertised in October 2003 are encouraged to re-apply if they
feel that their situation merits it.  Again, any previous applicants who
are undecided should contact Professor Iain Stewart for advice and guidance.

Further details on the University of Durham can be found via the
web-pages at http://www.durham.ac.uk, and on the Department of Computer
Science via the web-pages at http://www.durham.ac.uk/computer.science.

Informal enquiries about any of the positions may be made to Professor
Iain Stewart: telephone +44 (0)191 3341720; e-mail
i.a.stewart@durham.ac.uk.

Hello,

   What relation if any is there
between game semantics and game theory a la von
Neumann/Nash? Also what is relationship between game
theory in model theory and von Neumann/Nash game
theory?

Kind regards, Bill Halchin

Bill --

One difference is that von Neumann/Nash games typically assume a payoff
(a reward or loss) to participants upon termination of the game, whereas
the abstract games discussed in game semantics usually do not assume
this.  Players in the latter either just win or lose, or the game is
drawn, at termination; there is no other reward to the players.

Accordingly,  the games of game semantics are closer in spirit and
design to the dialogue games studied and played by philosophers since at
least the time of Aristotle, and which now form the basis for design of
computer interaction protocols.   Presumably the reseach funding
agencies who sponsored Aristotle's research will be pleased that it is,
at long last, being exploited commercially!

That is a nice point. In consequence, so far as I know, no one is
interested in `mixed strategies' for games in set theory or
semantics.  There is no sense to the `average/expected payoff' for a
randomized strategy as there is no payoff.  Mixed strategies are the focus
of most economic and such uses of game theory.  The usual question is how
to find optimal mixed strategies when there is no winning one.

The usual question for games in set theory or semantics is just whether one
player has a winning strategy.  That is the only question in the uses I
know of.

    Although it seems that three-player generalizations of the latter
type of games may need something more nuanced than just "win" or "lose"
to ensure that there is not a situation in which a player who cannot
himself win may make an arbitrary choice of which other player does so.
One obvious solution is to declare a "winner" and  "loser" [who has to
pay the winner, wash the winner's car, or whatever], and (for
instance,in a Nim-type game) to declare that the player due to play
immediately after the winner is the loser. It is then not a matter of
indifference to any player how the game turns out.

    However, there are wheels within wheels: for in a game that is not
completely trivial [a trivial game would be like Nim with N piles of
size 1, in which there are no bad moves] there is the possibility that
the player who is due to come in second if everybody plays to maximize
their immediate position may choose to "throw" the game, moving to third
place and putting the erstwhile loser into the lead. This would be an
irrational play on its own, but in combination with a pact for the new
leader to throw the game in turn, both conspirators would end up ahead
of their original positions. The question now is - is there honor among
hustlers? Will the original loser renege? Can the pact be enforced?

    This lands us fair and square in the middle of the von Neumann/Nash
kind of game theory.  What if anything this says about generalizations
of game sematics I do not know.

    John H. Conway told me when I was a graduate student that this area was
under active investigation by somebody or other, but I haven't heard of
anything that came of it.

This is to announce the publication of the following book

Truly yours

Francis Borceux and Dominique Bourn



Mal'cev, Protomodular, Homological and Semi-Abelian Categories
--------------------------------------------------------------
by Francis Borceux and Dominique Bourn

Mathematics and its Applications, volume 566, 2004
Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Boston, London
ISBN 1-4020-1961-0


The purpose of the book is to take stock of the situation concerning
Algebra via Category Theory in the last fifteen years, where the new and
synthetic notions of Mal'cev, protomodular, homological and semi-abelian
categories emerged. These notions force attention on the fibration of
points and allow a unified treatment of the main algebraic: homological
lemmas, Noether isomorphisms, commutator theory.

The book gives full importance to examples and makes strong connections
with Universal Algebra. One of its aims is to allow appreciating how
productive the essential categorical constraint is: knowing an object,
not from inside via its elements, but from outside via its relations
with its environment.

The book is intended to be a powerful tool in the hands of researchers
in category theory, homology theory and universal algebra, as well as a
textbook for graduate courses on these topics.

The table of contents is the following:

Peter May and another colleague have kindly pointed out to me that section 6
of my paper "Omega Categories I" is complete rubbish. In that section I
claimed to offer a simple proof of the Baez-Dolan stabilization conjecture but
clearly I have completely misunderstood the substance of that conjecture.

I expect to have more to say on this subject another day but meantime will be
content with the observation that the rest of the paper is independent of the
seriously flawed section 6.

I offer my apology to those who were mislead or confused by that section of
the paper and would like to thank Peter et. al. for their interest and help.

CALL FOR PAPERS


Logic, Games and Philosophy: Foundational Perspectives

Prague International Colloquium

www.flu.cas.cz/Logica/Aconf/col2004.html

Organised by
Department of Logic, Institute of Philosophy, Academy of Sciences of the
Czech Republic, and

Department of Philosophy, University of Helsinki

28 September =E2=80=93 1 October 2004, Prague, Czech Republic


SYNOPSIS

Games, like logics, are tools for investigating the world, language, and
their relationship. Semantic, dialogic, evolutionary, interrogative,
argumentative, and pragmatic methods have been included into the toolkit.
Following the recent increase in investment on games and game-theoretic
methods in logic, language, computation and communication, we still need =
a
better understanding of the possibilities of forming converging
methodologies underlying these diverse contemporary currents. The purpose=
 of
the Prague Conference on Logic, Games and Philosophy: Foundational
Perspectives is to explore the interfaces between logic and games with th=
e
eye on philosophical, methodological and foundational issues.


Preference is given to papers that make a definite contribution to
philosophical, methodological and foundational issues underlying
game-theoretic approaches to logical, computational or linguistic researc=
h,
including relevant historical and philosophical issues on the Theory of
Games itself.

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

* Wittgenstein, C. S. Peirce
* Language Games
* Game-Theoretic Semantics
* Dialogue Games
* Interrogative Games/Philosophy of Science
* Evolutionary Games
* Diachronicity/Semantic-Pragmatic Change
* Game-Theoretic Methods in Logic, Language, Computation, Communication

Among the invited speakers of the colloquium are Mathieu Marion (Qu=C3=A9=
bec =C3
Montr=C3=A9al), Shahid Rahman (Lille 3), Gabriel Sandu (Helsinki), Wim Ve=
ldman
(Nijmegen).

Potential contributors are asked to submit a two page (including referenc=
es)
abstract; the deadline is 15 June 2004. Abstracts are to be submitted by
e-mail (preferably as PDF, PS or MS Word files) prepared for anonymous
reviewing. (To prevent problems caused by e-mail failures, the receipt of
every abstract will be confirmed within one week.) Notification of
acceptance will be distributed by 15 July 2004. Contributed papers are
scheduled for approx. 40 minutes (including discussion).

Please direct your abstracts to: lanna@site.cas.cz

The proceedings of the Prague International Colloquium will be offered to
Kluwer Academic Publishers for inclusion in their series Logic, Epistemol=
ogy
and the Unity of Science (the papers will be reviewed).

Professorships, Readerships, Lectureships, Tutorships.
======================================================
The department of computer science at Swansea (Wales, UK) is
currently advertising academic positions at all levels.
We hope expecially to expand our groups in visual
computing and in logic/theoretical computer
science.

Our department was rated 5 in the last research assessment exericse.
It has a strong group in logic and
theoretical computer science which is amongst the biggest in
UK. The members of that group are Ulrich Berger (proof theory,
computability theory, type theory),  Phil Grant (artificial
intelligence), Andy Gimblett (algebraic specification),
Neal Harman (hardware verification, models of computation,
algebraic specification), Oliver Kullmann (satisfiability problems),
Markus Michelbrink (category theory, proof theory, type theory),
Faron Moller (automata theory, modal and temporal logic),
Markus Roggenbach (algebraic specification), Monika Seisenberger
(proof theory, type theory, computability theory),
Anton Setzer (proof theory, type theory) and
John Tucker (algebraic specification, algebraic methods,
computability theory). We have as well strong links to the
mathematics department, with Roger Hindley (lambda-calculus) and
Jiang-Lun Wu (nonstandard analysis).

The deadline for application is 25 June 2004 (I have been
signalled that late applications might still be acceptable).
The official advertisements can be found at
http://www.jobs.ac.uk/jobfiles/IS433.html and

                              UNIF 2004
               18th International Workshop on Unification
                  July 4-5, 2004, Cork,  Ireland
                      Affiliated with IJCAR'04

         http://www.faculty.iu-bremen.de/mkohlhase/event/unif04/


UNIF is the main international meeting on unification. Unification is
concerned with the problem of identifying given terms, either
syntactically or modulo a given logical theory. Syntactic unification
is the basic operation of most automated reasoning systems, and
unification modulo theories can be used, for instance, to build in
special equational theories into theorem provers.

The aim of UNIF 2004, as that of the previous meetings, is to to bring
together people interested in unification, present recent (even
unfinished) work, and discuss new ideas and trends in unification and
related fields. In particular, it is intended to offer a good
opportunity for young researches and researchers working in related
areas to get an overview of the current state of the art in
unification theory and get in contact with the experts in the field.

                    Call for Papers

           Structural Operational Semantics

       http://www.cs.auc.dk/~luca/SOS-WORKSHOP/

          A Satellite Workshop of CONCUR 2004
        30 August, 2004, London, United Kingdom


Structural operational semantics (SOS) provides a framework
for giving operational semantics to programming and specification
languages.  A growing number of programming languages from
commercial and academic spheres have been given usable semantic
descriptions by means of structural operational semantics.
Because of its intuitive appeal and flexibility, structural
operational semantics has found considerable application in
the study of the semantics of concurrent processes.  Moreover,
it is becoming a viable alternative to denotational semantics
in the static analysis of programs, and in proving compiler
correctness.

Recently, structural operational semantics has been successfully
applied as a formal tool to establish results that hold for classes
of process description languages. This has allowed for
the generalization of well-known results in the field of process
algebra, and for the development of a meta-theory for process calculi
based on the realization that many of the results in this field
only depend upon general semantic properties of language constructs.

The proposed SOS workshop aims to be a forum for researchers,
students and practitioners interested in new developments and
directions for future investigation in the field of structural
operational semantics. One of the specific goals of the workshop is
to establish synergies between the concurrency and programming
language communities working on the theory and practice of SOS.

The workshop will also mark the publication of a special issue of
the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming, devoted to SOS.
Together with original research papers on SOS, this special issue
will feature a definitive version of Gordon Plotkin's 1981 DAIMI memo
on SOS, together with a piece by Plotkin on the origins of SOS.

Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

    * programming languages
    * process algebras
    * higher-order formalisms
    * rule formats for operational specifications
    * meaning of operational specifications
    * comparisons between denotational, axiomatic and SOS
    * compositionality of modal logics with respect to
      operational specifications
    * congruence with respect to behavioural equivalences
    * conservative extensions
    * derivation of proof rules from operational specifications
    * software tools that automate, or are based on, SOS

Papers reporting on applications of SOS to software engineering and
other areas of computer science are welcome.

Paper submission:

We solicit unpublished papers reporting on original research on
the general theme of SOS. Prospective authors are invited to submit
a pdf or postscript file with their extended abstract, whose length
should not exceed 15 pages, by email to all of the co-chairs at their
respective email addresses. The email message with the submission
should also include, in plain text, contact information for
the author(s), together with the title and abstract of the submission.
Submissions are to be received by Sunday, 6 June, 2004. Authors will
be notified of acceptance by Wednesday, 30 June, 2004. Submissions
from the PC members are allowed.

Proceedings:

Preliminary proceedings containing the abstracts of the talks will be
published as a volume in the BRICS Notes Series, and will be available
at the meeting. The final proceedings of the workshop will appear as
a volume in the ENTCS series.

If the quality and quantity of the submissions warrant it, the co-chairs
plan to arrange a special issue of an archival journal devoted to full
versions of selected papers from the workshop.

Important Dates:

    * Submission: Sunday 6 June 2004
    * Notification: Wednesday 30 June 2004
    * Final version: Friday July 16 2004

An adjunction has a functorial mono-epi factorization, so natural to be
likely well known. I would like to have a *reference* for this.

Let   F -| G,  where  F: X --> A  and  G: A --> X.  Then our adjunction
has an obvious factorisation through the isomorphic comma categories:

   W = (F | A) = (X | G)

using the full coreflective embedding of  X  in  W,  and the full
reflective embedding of  A  in  W.

W  might be called the 'graph' of the adjunction; or has it been called
differently?

R. Pare and myself, we have used a similar result for double categories,
for a colax double functor left adjoint to a lax one: Thm. 3.7 in 'Adjoints
for double categories', to appear in 'Cahiers'. But I need now the result
for ordinary categories, for applications to directed homotopy.

Best regards

The following preprint is available:

M. Grandis,
The shape of a category up to directed homotopy,
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 509 (May 2004), 44 p.

Abstract.  This work is a contribution to a recent field, Directed
Algebraic Topology. Categories which appear as fundamental categories of
'directed structures', e.g. ordered topological spaces, have to be studied
up to appropriate notions of directed homotopy equivalence, wider than
ordinary equivalence of categories.

   Here we introduce 'past' and 'future equivalences' of categories - sort
of symmetric versions of an adjunction - and use them and their
combinations to get 'directed models' of a category; in the simplest case,
these are the join of the least full reflective and the least full
coreflective subcategory.

MSC: 55Pxx, 18A40, 68Q85.

Keywords: homotopy theory, adjunctions, reflective subcategories, directed
algebraic topology, fundamental category, concurrent processes .

Hi,

I was teaching some students recently that there are 2 kinds of inductive
definition of a set:

(a) By giving an "ambient" set A, and a family of relations A^{n}-->A.
This defines the least subset of A closed under all these relations, i.e.
the least prefixed point of the monotone endofunction on powerset(A)
mapping each subset B to the set of all elements related to B.

(b) By giving a signature.  This defines the initial algebra for (the
endofunctor on Set determined by) the signature.

I also wanted to treat the countably infinitary case, so (a) could allow
relations A^{omega}-->A, and (b) could allow operations of arity omega.
And I wanted to further generalize both (a) and (b) to the many-sorted
setting.  (Though in (a), the many-sorted situation can be reduced to the
single-sorted one by taking the sum of the ambient sets.)

-----------------------

I then proceeded to ask them: how do we know that (a) the least prefixed
point and (b) the initial algebra exist?

For (a) I gave 3 proofs:

(i) take the intersection of all such subsets of A

(ii) start from the empty set, and iteratively apply the monotone
endofunction on the powerset of A that maps C to the set of all elements
related to elements of C, taking unions at countable limit ordinals and
terminating at the first uncountable limit

(iii) take the set of elements of A for which there exists at least one
wellfounded prooftree.

For (b) I gave 2 proofs:

(i) start from the empty set, and iteratively apply the signature, taking
colimits at countable limit ordinals and terminating at the first
uncountable limit

(ii) take the set of all wellfounded operation-trees.

And all these 5 proofs adapt to the coinductive setting, except that
(a)(ii) and (b)(i) terminate already at omega.  However, coinduction was
not covered in the course.

---------------------------------------

I thought that (a)(iii) and (b)(ii) were actually the most important
constructions to teach the students, since they describe our basic
intuition.  But they require an appropriate definition of "tree".  In
(b)(ii), an operation-tree can be thought of a strategy for the following
game:

- Player picks an operation c_0 from the signature,

- Opponent picks an index i_0 in the arity of c_0

- Player picks an operation c_1 from the signature

etc.  And, as we know, there are several equivalent ways of defining
strategy.  I just picked one of them: a prefix-closed set sigma of
Opponent-awaiting plays

          c_0 i_0 c_1 i_1 ... c_n

subject (in this setting) to the constraint that any Player-awaiting play

          c_0 i_0 c_1 i_ 1 ... c_{n-1} i_{n-1}

which is consistent with sigma (i.e. every Opponent-awaiting prefix is in
sigma) has a unique one-place extension in sigma.  With this definition of
operation-tree, it was easy to complete proof (b)(ii).  And (a)(iii) is
similar, except that Player moves by supplying an operation together with
a tuple of A-elements.

My question is: where do these tree proofs appear in the literature?
Surely something so basic must appear somewhere?  The best I could find,
for (b), was to build a set of "terms" as a subset of an ambient set of
strings (they could be strings of operations, parentheses and commas, or
just strings of operations).  But it is quite unnecessary to use any
ambient set for (b), and, besides, that method would not work for the
infinitary or coinductive cases.

Some of what Paul Levy asked about --- building initial lagebras as sets
of well-founded trees --- is in an old paper of mine,

Words, free algebras, and coequalizers (Fund. Math. 117 (1983) 117--160),

but even then the idea certainly wasn't new.  That paper was concerned
(partly) with what happens in varieties of algebras with infinitary
operations --- so there are identities to be imposed on the terms.  As a
result, even the existence of free algebras with countable-ary operations
depends on the axiom of choice.

I have encountered a situation in which I have two categories C, D which
are related by a pair of adjoint functors L from C to D and R from D to
C.  Also, there is a cotriple S on C and a cotriple T on D.  Finally, there
is a natural isomorphism f from RT to SR.  It seems that if a couple of
diagrams relating f to the structure maps of the cotriples commute, then
there is an induced adjoint pair relating the two coalgebra categories.  Is
this, or something similar to it, in the literature in some easily
referenced place?

Thanks,
Gaunce

Dear all, I am pleased to advert a paper that has been for (too)long
in limbo. I eventually put the paper on the math archive  in march

http://arXiv.org/abs/math.CT/0403164

I acknowledge F. Borceux that suggested me a major improvement.
This work was first presented in Amiens in Nov. 03. and at the last
PSSL in Cambridge (Thank you all for your feedback).

Here is a short abstract.

The notion of P-flatness  and Q-acessibility are introduced
where the prameters P and Q stand for family of indexes in the
sense of Borceux-Kelly. The following points are proved.
Fixing a family P of indexes and Q denoting the family of
P-flat indexes:
- for a small category A, a presheaf on A is P-flat if and only
if it is a Q-colimit of representables.
- The full subcategory of the category of presheaves on a small A
generated by P-flat presheaves is the free Q-cocompletion of A.
Conversely Q-accessible categories occur as categories of P-flat
presheaves on small A's.

This correspondence yields meaningful internal description
for free-Q-cocomplete objects for suitable Q's. For instance
Lawvere's Cauchy-complete categories are exactly the full
subcategories of P0-flat presheaves on small A's for P0 the
family of ALL indexes.
Remarkably this theory of accessibility extends to the enriched context
(the only constraint on the base V is that it should be sym. & closed).
Actually it is very likely that the whole theory might be developed
in a 2-category with a Yoneda structure.
Other completions by means of P-flat preshaves may be considered.
For instance one obtains this way completions of metric spaces in terms
of asymmetric Cauchy-filters. One also retrieves the algebraic  completions
of partial orders.

Best regards to you all,
Vincent.

Although I cannot be sure, this looks an awful lot like an adjoint triple.
I think Charles and I had a section of TTT on this.  It was certainly not
new with us and may have even been in Harry Appelgate's thesis back around
40 years ago.

This situation has been encountered since at least 1970 by various
categorists, including myself.  A relevant paper is:
  D. Pumpl\"un, Eine Bemerkung \"uber Monaden und adjungierte Funktoren,
  Math. Annalen 185, 329-337 (1970).
If Gaunce's two commuting diagrams are the usual ones, then his
conjecture is correct.  Observe that in this situation, we have not just
a pair but a quadruple of dual categories, replacing C and D by their
duals, or inverting the direction of arrows, or both.

This may just be a "folk theorem", but it should have been published by
someone, somewhere, and I would also like to have an easily accessible
reference, or references.

See (for the dual situation) an old paper of mine:

Adjoint lifting theorems for categories of algebras, Bull London Math.
Soc. 7 (1975), 294--297.

I should say (before others say it for me) that this was not the first
place the result appeared: it (and much more) was in the famous
unpublished (and largely unwritten) thesis of Bill Butler. But Gaunce
asked for a published reference.

International Masters Program in COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC

The International Center for Computational Logic at the Technische
Universitaet Dresden is offering a two-year study program, in English,
leading to a master of science (M.Sc.)  in computer science.  This is a
joint program with the Universidade Nova de Lisboa and the Technische
Universitaet Wien.

Courses focus on logic and constraint programming, artificial
intelligence, knowledge representation and reasoning, type theory, model
theory, proof theory, equational reasoning, databases, natural language
processing, planning and formal methods, among others.

The tuition fees are waived.  At the end of the programme a research
master thesis has to be prepared.

Prerequisites are a good knowledge of the basics of logic, and
familiarity with mathematical reasoning.  Knowledge of foundations of
artificial intelligence and logic programming is desirable.  It is
indispensable being fluent in English; German is not necessary at all,
but there are facilities for studying it if desired.  A bachelor in
Computer Science, or equivalent degree, is required by the beginning of
courses, in October 2004.

Dresden, on the river Elbe, is one of the most important art cities of
Germany.  The economy is growing rapidly and Dresden is a top high-tech
centre.  AMD built the most modern chip factory in Europe, Infineon
Technologies, Siemens and many other companies invest here.  The
possibilities of getting a job after the master are excellent.  The
University is very well equipped and the teachers/students ratio is
close to 1.  International contacts make it easy for interested students
to continue pursuing a career in research.

Deadline for applications is June 15, 2004, but applications are
processed as they come.  To apply, please send all the relevant
documents by post to the address below.  Further information is on the
web at <http://www.cl.inf.tu-dresden.de/compulog/>.  Paper information
material is available on request.

Please give this message broad distribution.

This paper may also be relevant (again in the dual situation, with monads):

   Jean-Pierre Meyer "Induced functors on categories of algebras",
Mathematische Zeitschrift 142 (1975) 1-14.

This relaxes the condition that it should be a natural isomorphism
between RT and SR. Instead it has a monad functor from (D,T) to (C,S)
and a left adjoint monad opfunctor. It constructs an adjoint pair of
functors between the algebra categories. However, it does assume that
one of the algebra categories has coequalizers.

For monad functors and opfunctors see

   Ross Street "The formal theory of monads", Journal of Pure and
Applied Algebra 2 (1972) 149-168.

                        University of British Columbia
                             Vancouver, Canada

   This conference will be held on the University of British Columbia
campus. It will begin with a reception at 6pm on Sunday July 18, 2004, and
will end at 1pm on Saturday July 24, 2004. All those interested in
category theory and its applications are welcome.

Information about deadlines for abstracts, registration and accommodation
may be found at the end of this letter as well as on the conference website
http://www.pims.math.ca/science/2004/CT04

If you think that you will attend or may attend, and have not previously
made any indication of this to the organizer, then please send a note to
johnm@math.ubc.ca with the words "will attend" or "may attend", as
appropriate. The issue involved here is whether the PIMS new lecture
room can be used for the talks or whether something bigger will have
to be booked.

Some important deadlines are as follows:

Abstracts - May 31, 2004. If you would like to give a talk at the
conference, then please send in a short abstract of length about
half a page but not longer than one page. Please submit this on
the form from the conference website

http://www.pims.math.ca/science/2004/CT04/abstracts.html

Due to the potentially large number of submissions it may not be possible
to reserve a place on the program for all those who submit an abstract.

Registration Deposit or Early Registration payment - May 31, 2004
Please see the website

http://www.pims.math.ca/science/2004/CT04/registration.html

It is possible to make payment by bank transfer in addition to the option
of payment by cheque. Details of the address and account number can be
supplied on request.

Accommodation - June 18, 2004. After this date the block of rooms
reserved for CT04 will be released to the general public, although
reservations can still be made if space is available. Early booking is
recommended, especially for those with accompanying persons.

Extra spaces for the excursion or banquet for accompanying persons -
June 30, 2004. The opening reception, excursion and banquet for delegates
is included in the conference fee as well as morning and afternoon coffee
breaks, lecture room rentals and other miscellaneous conference expenses.
Accommodation and meals are not included in the fee.

              Affiliated with LICS 2004

     http://quasar.mathstat.uottawa.ca/~selinger/qpl2004/

                * * *

  Registration for this workshop is now available, please see below
  for registration information and a list of talks.

OVERVIEW:

  The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working
  on mathematical formalisms and programming languages for quantum
  computing. In the last few years, there has been a growing interest
  in logical tools, languages, and semantical methods for analyzing
  quantum computation. These foundational approaches complement the
  more mainstream research in quantum computation which emphasizes
  algorithms and complexity theory.

  Possible topics include the syntax and semantics of quantum
  programming languages, new paradigms for quantum programming,
  specification of quantum algorithms, higher-order quantum
  computation, quantum data types, reversible computation, axiomatic
  approaches to quantum computation, concurrent and distributed
  quantum computation, compilation of quantum programs, semantical
  methods in quantum information theory, and categorical models for
  quantum computation.

  The first workshop in this series was held June 15-16, 2003, in
  Ottawa, Canada.

REGISTRATION:

  Registration and local arrangements will be handled through the
  LICS 2004 main conference (http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/als/lics/lics04/).
  There will be a small fee for attending the workshop, which will
  cover lunch, coffee, and the informal proceedings.

In seventh or eighth grade -- a long time ago -- , I learned the name
"goldener Schnitt" (golden ratio, ratio aurea) for the positive solution
of the equation x^2 = x + 1.  Recently, I read an article, I forgot
where, discussing this number and using \phi as the "accepted symbol"
for it.  The old name was never mentioned.

So far, I have only met three real or complex numbers with universally
accepted one-letter symbols:  \pi, e, i.  Have I missed something?

An abstract of my proposed talk for next month's CT04 at
UBC Vancouver has just been put up at

http://fej.math.wes.home.att.net/CT04-Abstract.htm .

My talks at Union College, Bangalore, and Calcutta last November,
December, and January, respectively, are abstracted in the item

http://b.mikolajewska.home.att.net/text/SIPRfejAbstrct.htm ,

which also provides links to two browser-optimized versions
(one for Netscape, one for MSIE; I hope that other browsers
will find that at least one of these renders acceptably) of
a uniform write-up of what I had to say at those events.

Comments, suggestions, errata, broken HTML?
Please call these all to my attention.
Thanks.

Here's a related reference: the appendix of

C.Hermida and B.Jacobs, Structural Induction and Coinduction in a
fibrational setting, Information and Computation 145(2) 107-152,1998.

stablishes the suitable 2-functoriality of categories of (co)algebras
for endofunctors as inserters (which does not follow straightforwardly
from their weighted limit formulation) and the more or less immediate
corollaries of induced adjoints, without any coequalisers or additional
structure. It is remarkably simple but fairly useful.

The result (and the argument) extends literally to the case of
Eilenberg-Moore algebras for monads: using the (old) notion of morphism
of monads from (a), given a pseudo-morphism of monads (f,\theta):M -> N
(where \theta is iso), if f has a right adjoint g, adjoint transposition
of \theta yields (g,\theta'):N -> M right adjoint to (f,\theta) in Mnd
(b), and 2-functoriality of algebras yields the desired adjunction
between the categories of algebras (commuting with the forgetful
functors, of course). Once again, no structure is required on the
categories involved.

PS: There is a more liberal notion of 2-cell for Mnd, essentially
arising from internal category theory, but I don't know its impact in
the above adjoint results.

[note from moderator: several replies were received on this item - which
is admittedly off-topic; they are digested below.]

There are a number of books on the subject  - or on the related Fibonacci
numbers - which call it "the golden ratio", "the golden number", "the divine
proportion", as well as phi.  (Check out Amazon for example.)  I think the
name isn't as "fixed" as pi, e, or i, but it's pretty standard, within a
small orbit.  (Maple doesn't know it - unlike Pi!)

Actually, in a sense, i isn't as standard as pi or e - at least in
engineering circles, some prefer J (or j).  (I've never seen a
*mathematical* writer use J though - anyone?)

Of course there are lots of non-real, non-complex, numbers with universally
accepted one-letter symbols.  (omega ... do you allow subscripts?)  But real
or complex?  (And presumably not constants from physics ...)  No others
spring to mind, though I'm willing to bet that 5 minutes after I hit "send"
one will do so!  Close?  There are a few, like the Euler constant gamma
(lim_{n->\infty} (sum_{k=1}^n 1/k - ln n), but I suspect most mathematicians
would have to look such cases up, so they hardly qualify.  (I only know
about gamma because it came up in conversation this past semester at work!)

I have no idea if you've missed something, but at least in the English
speaking world \phi as the name for the golden ratio has indeed become the
"accepted symbol".  Asking Google about 'phi number "golden ratio"' produced
8120 pages containing all of those.  This includes, for example,

A biography of the number phi:
The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi: The World's Most Astonishing Number
Mario Livio
Broadway Books, 320 pp, $24.95

I don't know if the use of \phi for the golden ratio is common in other
languages, but I suspect the pervasive effect of the English usage has had its
effect.

    As a generalization: "Golden ratio" is used by geometers being
informal, autodidacts, historians, popular math writers, and crackpots.

    $\phi$ is used by popular math writers, autodidacts, and the better
class of crackpots.

    $\tau$ is used by most mathematicians.

    A not-entirely-correct analogy:

    golden ratio:$\phi$:\tau$ :: blue vitriol : copper sulphate: copper(II)
sulphate pentahydrate

Going by today's final arbiter of the universal, Google switches into
calculator mode when queried for "e", "phi" and "pi" (delivering for
each its numerical value to 8 decimal places -- it also names "phi" as
"the golden ratio"). Google does not switch into calculator mode for
"gamma" or "i" but it does for "1*gamma" (naming it as "1 * Euler's
constant") and "1*i" (with no name). If you're willing to count
dimensioned numbers then it also recognizes (and names) "c", "h", "k",
and "u" if, in each case, you preface it with "1*".

If you go beyond single letters then who knows? A few I've found are
"1*au", "1*googol" and "1*mark twain". (Alas, Google has not yet
learned to recognize "1*millihelen".)

I don't know what this has to do with categories, but it gives me
the chance to recycle some trivia I recently learned.  This number
1.618... is widely called phi, but also Phi - and also tau.   It was
named Phi after the Greek sculptor Phidias, who helped design the Parthenon.
But it was named this only in 1914, in a book called The Curves of Life,
by the artist Theodore Cook.  And it was Cook who first started calling
1.618... the golden ratio!  Before him, 0.618... was called the golden
ratio.  Cook dubbed this number "phi", the lower-case baby brother of Phi.

In fact, the whole "golden" terminology can only be traced back to 1826,
when it showed up in a footnote to a book by one Martin Ohm, brother
of Georg Ohm, the guy with the law about resistors.  Before then, a lot
of people called 1/G the "Divine Proportion".  And the guy who started
that was Luca Pacioli, a pal of Leonardo da Vinci who translated Euclid's
Elements.  In 1509, Pacioli published a 3-volume text entitled Divina
Proportione, advertising the virtues of this number.

Sure - the Euler-Mascheroni constant,

gamma = 0.5772156649015...

      = lim_{n->infinity} (integral_1^n dx/x) - (1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/n)

See:

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Euler-MascheroniConstant.html

By the way, engineers often call i "j".

Best,
jb

[and one more...]

In reply to the question from Oswald Wyler <owyler@suscom-maine.net>
let me quote from Donald E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming
(1968, 1973), Section 1.2.8:

The number $\phi$ itself has a very interesting history.  Euclid
called it the "extreme and mean ratio"; the ratio of A to B
is the ratio of (A+B) to A, if the ratio of A to B is $\phi$.
Renaissance writers called it the "divine proportion"; and in the
last century it has commonly been called the "golden ratio".  In
the art world, the ratio of $\phi$ to 1 is said to be the most
pleasing proportion aesthetically, and this opinion is confirmed
from the standpoint of computer programming aesthetics as well.
For the story of $\phi$, see the excellent article "The Golden
Section, Phyllotaxis, and Whythoff's Game", by H.S.M. Coxeter,
Scripta Math. 19 (1953), 135-143, and see also Chapter 8 of
The 2nd Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions,
by Martin Gardner (New York:  Simon and Schuster, 1961).
