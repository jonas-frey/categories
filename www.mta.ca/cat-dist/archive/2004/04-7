I do not think that anyone has written a biography of AG, but he has
written an autobiography, called Recoltes et semailles (Reapings and
Sowings--the order is intentionally backwards).  It is not publicly
available (not published) but someone has, I understand, done a Russian
translation that is.  There is also a (very) partial English translation
that is an ongoing project that requires money to proceed.  Thus if you
want to read it, you have to send cash to the translator, Roy Lisker.  See
his web page, http://www.fermentmagazine.org/, for more details.  I cannot
vouch for the quality of the translation, but I disagree with him on how
to translate the title. I think he called it Harvests and Sowings, which
clanks on my ear.  He says his French is better than mine, which I won't
argue, but my wife agrees with me and she is a professional French to
English translator.  Besides we are not arguing over the meaning, but the
best sounding English.  Be that as it may, it is the best you can do
unless you can read it in Russian (which I assume from your name you can).
Sorry, I don't know a source for that.

There's a category problem already at this point.  Dinats don't go between
functors F,G:C->D, they go between sesquifunctors F:C^op x C->D and differ
from n.t.'s of that type by only being defined on the diagonal of C^op x C.
The off-diagonal and non-identity-morphism entries in F,G only participate
in the dinaturality condition, not in the transformation itself.

>a) It is well known that there is no vertical
>composition of dinatural transformations.
>How about horizontal composition?

Before you can compose dinats horizontally you have to be able to compose
the sesquifunctors they bridge.  I don't know how others do this, but if I
had to compose G:D^op x D -> E with F:C^op x C -> D, my inclination would
be to restrict the evident composite G(F(a,b),F(c,d)) to a=d, b=c (i.e.
where the variances match up).  That is, GoF:C^op x C -> E is defined by
G(F(c,c'),F(c',c)) on object pairs (c',c) of C^op x C, with the expected
extension to morphism pairs (f',f) where f':c'->d' in C^op (i.e.
f':d'->c' in C) and f:c->d in C, namely

  G(F(f,f'),F(f',f)): G(F(c,c'),F(c',c)) -> G(F(d,d'),F(d',d)).

With that (or some) choice of sesquifunctor composition one can then ask
about horizontal composition tos where s:F->F', t:G->G'.  How would you
whisker a dinatural on the left, i.e. apply the whisker G:D^op x D->E
on the left to the dinat s:F->F' on the right where F,F':C^op x C->D?
For natural transformations, G is just a functor G:D->E, so this is just a
matter of applying G pointwise to each s_c.  For dinaturals however, G is
a sesquifunctor.  What do you want a sesquifunctor to do to a morphism s_c?
Maybe there's some span-like thing one can do here but I don't see it.

For dinaturals, vertical composition may turn out to be easier than
horizontal, in that it at least makes sense provided one solves the
shape-matching problem somehow.  In doing so one also solves another
problem, that dinaturality is too weak a condition, typically admitting
transformations on the internal hom that aren't Church numerals (Pare & Roman,
JPAA 128 33-92 for Set, Pratt, TCS 294:3, bottom of p461, for Chu(Set,K) and
chu(Set,K) which awkwardly seem to need different treatments).  Mike Barr
has a notion of strong dinatural (unpublished?), and the notion of binary
(more generally n-ary) logical transformation also works well here when
definable on the category of interest.

I'm pretty sure there is no book length biography, but there is some
information at:

http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/biographic.php

which is really the information from www.grothendieck-circle.org which appears
to be off-line at the moment.

People may like to look at the Spectator article:

http://www.lewrockwell.com/spectator/spec262.html

I thought Recollte et Semaille translated as `Reaping and sowing'?

He was a great correspondent in the 1980s, and we have a mass of letters
which will be transferred to an archive in good hands in due course (my
administrative matters have got too much at present). This correspondence
is relevant to Pursuing Stacks, which was written in English as a response
to our correspondence in English, which he describes in `Esquisse d'un
programme' (EdP) as `a baton rompu' (ranging over this and that). In fact
EdP is available in French and English translation in books by Pierre
Lochack and Leila Schneps (LMS Lecture notes series). Pursuing Stacks was
to have been volume 1 of a series on `The long march towards Galois
theory', written in a new informal style, as in Pursuing Stacks, where the
thought is open to view. I suspect that writing R&S distracted him from
this aim.

I expect to explain the correspondence which led to Pursuing Stacks being
sent to me, and Larry Breen, and then circulated from Bangor,  in 1983, but
have not yet got round to it.

In any case, Pursuing Stacks seems to be increasingly influential, as does
EdP.

There is a `canonical' choice of composition for such `sesquifunctors'
(what follows is presumably folklore and written up somewhere).

Consider the category SDCat of *self-dual* categories: objects are
categories C, equipped with a duality c: C -> C^op (with c^op c = id),
and morphisms F: (C,c) -> (D,d) are functors F:C -> D such that F^op c =
d F. The forgetful SDCat -> Cat admits both adjoints (and SDCat is
actually both monadic and comonadic over Cat): the right adjoint takes a
category A to (A^op x A, s) where s is the switch isomorphism (the
second projection \pi' : A^op x A -> A is the counit of the
adjunction).  We thus get a comonad G on Cat, and sesquifunctors are the
morphisms of the resulting Kleisli category Cat_G, which tells us how to
compose G:D^op x D -> E with F:C^op x C -> D. The composite is G(F^op s,
F)\delta, which agrees indeed with the formula above. (This is  of
course the composite in SDCat via the adjunction)

The counterexamples mentioned in P. Scott's posting concern the lack of
a well-defined *vertical* composition of dinaturals. If one persists on
endowing them with such a composite, one possible approach is to accept
the partiality of this composition and work with *paracategories*.
Pushing this simple idea to its logical conclusion leads to a decent
enough basic theory, which allows to make sense of the fact that `dinats
into a ccc form a cartesian-closed paracat'. See

Hermida, C; Mateus, P.
Paracategories. II. Adjunctions, fibrations and examples from
probabilistic automata theory.
Theoret. Comput. Sci. 311 (2004), no. 1-3, 71--103.

(also available at my homepage  http://maggie.cs.queensu.ca/chermida)

Making a 2-dimensional structure with dinats, using their partial
vertical composition, leads to consider enrichment over ParCat (the
cartesian closed category of paracategories). But whiskering (and
therefore *horizontal* composition) is bound to be a partial operation
as well, so one has to broaden/weaken ParCat to accommodate this fact.
Ultimately, the kind of composite required in Yanosfky's posting:

S,S':C^op x C---->B  T,T':C^op x C ----> B^op U,U':B^op x B --->A
\alpha: S--->S' dinat \alpha': T--->T' dinat \beta: U--->U' dinat
-------------------------------------------------------------------
\beta \circ (\alpha',\alpha)

suggests a *partial multicategory* structure (as introduced in the
article above), with homs in ParCat.

For a philosophy article I need one or two comprehensive references to
categorical logic, especially emphasizing the array of doctrines.  I mean,
from algebraic theories to left exact theories to coherent theories and such.

I have hundreds of references.  I need one or two.  Very quick surveys are
fine for this, even preferable.  What is there?

An old but still useful reference is Kock & Reyes' article in the Handbook of
Mathematical Logic (of course, for a mid-70's paper, it's a bit dated by
now!).  Phil Scott has written some more recent ones, including "Some
Aspects of Categories in Computer Science (Survey Article on Categorical
Logic)" and "Category Theory for Linear Logicians" (with R. Blute),
available on his website (he can provide the pub refs).

Nason Yanofsky asked a question about composition of dinatural
transformations, and there have been a number of replies - but none
giving the reference I should have expected, namely [S.Eilenberg and
G.M.Kelly, A generalization of the functorial calculus,, J.Algebra 3
(1966), 366 - 375] .

What Sammy and I  were concerned with were such families as  the
evaluationn e_A,B : [A,B] o A --> B , where o is a tensor product and [
, ] is an internal hom. Here e_A,B is natural in B in the usual sense;
it is also natural, in our extended sense, in the variable A, which
appears twice on one side of the arrow, but with two opposite variances.
Similar for d_A,B : A --> [B, AoB]. In certain circumstances one can
compose such "natural transformations" to form new ones:one example is
the composite

                  AoB ---------> [B, AoB] o B ----------> AoB
                             d_A,B o B                     e_B, AoB

which is in fact the identity natural transformation.

Sammy and I gave a general treatment in the article above. Later, others
generalised our "extended naturals" to get the notion of dinatural
transformation. Since these do not compose except in some very special
cases, I find them to be of limited interest.   In contrast, I find that
I still use the Eilenberg-Kellycalculus from time to time.

Max Kelly.

NEW JOURNAL----NEW JOURNAL----NEW JOURNAL----NEW JOURNAL----NEW JOURNAL

-------------------------EXCUSE MULTIPLE COPIES-----------------------




L O G I C A L   M E T H O D S    I N   C O M P U T E R   S C I E N C E


Dear Colleague:

We are writing to inform you about a new open-access, online, refereed
journal: "Logical Methods in Computer Science". As an open-access
publication, the journal will be freely available on the web. This new
journal will be devoted to all theoretical and practical topics in
computer science related to logic in a broad sense.  You can find the
homepage at

        http://www.lmcs-online.org

The journal will open to submissions on September 1, 2004.

It will be published under the auspices of The International Federation
for Computational Logic: http://www.colognet.org/IFCoLog/.
The journal will technically be published as an overlay of the Computing
Research Repository (CoRR), see http://arxiv.org/archive/cs/intro.html.

On the homepage you find a flier and a leaflet containing the basic
information about the new journal. We would appreciate your posting
and distributing the information, and encouraging potential authors to
submit to Logical Methods in Computer Science.

You may have heard about the various developments in the past couple of
years in regard to the Open Access movement, see, e.g.,:

       http://www.zim.mpg.de/openaccess-berlin/berlindeclaration.html
       http://www.plos.org/
       http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm

and the link

     "Landscape..."

at the jornal website. The open-access idea is that knowledge,
including scientific knowledge, should be widely and readily available
to society, in a stable and long-term form. The Internet and electronic
publishing provides an evident means to that end. Not unrelated are
concerns arising from the increasingly high prices charged commercially.

There are already a few open-access journals in Computer Science, e.g.:

        http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/
        http://www.jair.org/ and
        http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/jmlr/.


We are convinced that now is the time to start one in our area of logic
and computer science.

Yours Sincerely,

Jiri Adamek,
Gordon D. Plotkin,
Dana S. Scott
and
Moshe Y. Vardi

      [Apologies for multiple copies of this announcement]

                   CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


                         ICGT 2004

                 2nd International Conference
                   on Graph Transformation

           Roma (Italy), September 28 - October 2, 2004


The second International Conference on Graph Transformation ICGT 2004,
along with several satellite events, will be held in Roma at the end
of September 2004. It follows the first ICGT 2002 (Barcelona, October
2002) and a series of six international workshops on graph
transformation with applications in computer science held from 1978 to
1998 in Europe and the USA. The conference takes place under the
auspices of EATCS, EASST, and IFIP WG 1.3.
The proceedings will appear in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
series by Springer-Verlag.
The conference is co-located with IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages
and Human Centric Computing (VL/HCC), September 26-29, 2004, allowing
its participants to have a closer look at this important, related
field.


Scope.

Graphical structures of various kinds (like graphs, diagrams, visual
sentences and others) are very useful to describe complex structures
and systems in a direct and intuitive way. These structures are often
augmented by formalisms which add to the static description a further
dimension modelling the evolution of systems via any kind of
transformation of such graphical structures. The field of Graph
Transformation is concerned with the theory, applications and
implementation issues of all these formalisms.
The theory is strongly related to areas such as graph theory and graph
algorithms, formal language and parsing theory, theory of concurrency
and distributed systems, formal specification and verification, logic
and semantics. The application areas include all those fields of
Computer Science, Information Processing, Engineering and Natural
Sciences where static and dynamic modeling by graphical structures and
graph transformations, respectively, play an important role.

  My translation of Harvests and Sowings (Alexandre's
own notion of how the title should be translated by
the way)is in fact available for free from my website.
I just stopped doing the translation after the
Introduction and Preface because I didn't have time to
continue it unless there was some money to pay for it.
   However, at <http://www.grothendieck-circle.org>,
there are dozens of pages of biographical material
about AG, his mother and his father. Every now and
then Leila Schneps adds to it.
  Incidentally, I've finally found the time to edit
and revise the Ferment series "Quest for
Grothendieck". It was hastily put together in 1989 and
needs considerable work to bring it up to book
quality. I estimate that the work  will take about a
year .Roy L.

Recent communications about Grothendieck's "Recoltes et semelles" refer
to the partial translation by Roy Lisker - but none, as far as I recall,
gives an electronic reference to the French original. Is it not
available in this form?

                        DOMAINS VII

             Darmstadt, August 29 - September 2, 2004



The WORKSHOP DOMAINS series is aimed at computer scientists and
mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
foundations of computation. It focuses on domains, their applications
and related topics.

The series was conceived and first realised by Klaus Keimel in
Darmstadt in 1994. This seventh workshop returns to Darmstadt on
the occasion of his 65th birthday.


LOCATION

The Workshop will take place at Technische Universitaet Darmstadt
located in the centre of the city of Darmstadt:

       Hochschulstrasse 1 (Altes Hauptgebaeude)
       Room S1 03/123

See:   www.tu-darmstadt.de/lageplaene/

To reiterate what I said in my original posting on the subject: No.  A
Russian translation does exist, but the original does not.  And Roy's very
small beginning is the only one available in English AFAIK.

Let me take this opportunity to describe the experience I had trying to
get permission from Grothendieck.  Some made the suggestion that TAC
reprint the Tohoku paper.  I had recently met one Jean Malgoire (not
Magloire, incidentally) who claimed to be the unique mathematician who is
in communication with Grothendieck.  I started by writing the editors of
Tohoku since in my experience these rights were kept by the journal.  They
told me that the rights were held by Grothendieck.  So I wrote to
Malgoire.  He replied that it was so unlikely that Grothendieck would
agree that he would not ask him.  Later someone told me that in fact,
Malgoire had full authority as Grothendieck's literary executor.  I don't
know if this in fact true, but even so he may well have felt that going
against Grothendieck's known wishes was inadvisable (although he could
have explained that to me, instead, apparently, of lying).  So I assume
that Grothendieck didn't want the original posted.  By the way, the third
word of the title is "semailles" (sowings, not seeds).

  The Grothendieck discussion has moved a bit far from the main reason
  for this list but, if I may, a couple of points:

  First -- in answer to Max's query -- Roy Lisker tells me that almost
  all of Grothendieck's autobiography in the original French has been
  transcribed onto www.grothendieck-circle.org.

  Second, who is Roy Lisker? I've valued him as a resource for over 40
  years. He was a student at Penn and a few years later I was a
  character witness in his trial for draft-card burning. Yep. And he
  served a 6 month sentence.

  Among other mathematicians who support his efforts are Lou Kauffman
  and Mike Barr (Mike has known him longer than I have). Take a look
  at www.fermentmagazine.org. First you might want to read:


                              Commonweal

                           Stop the Presses

                          by Richard Alleva

I enter the Russell Public Library of Middletown, Connecticut, just
around the corner from Wesleyan University. Walking past the
circulation desk, I turn left and enter a publisher's office.

No, wait, it's not a publisher's office but the library's reference
department. But, behold, in one corner, publishing is indeed in
progress. Crouched over a computer keyboard is a middle-aged man with
a pate appropriately monkish and a face appropriately gnomic, for like
any good writer he coaxes his thoughts onto the page with the humble
intensity of a monk decorating a manuscript or the greedy intensity of
a gnome counting his gold. He has slipped his complete works onto some
disks which he carries to and from the library. With the aid of a
benevolent library computer technician, he has installed a wide
variety of typefonts on the hard drive which not only he but any other
library patron can employ (thereby making our writer not only the
beneficiary but the benefactor of the library), and once he has
written at least a couple of drafts in longhand, he chooses the most
appropriate font for the story or essay in progress, types it, revises
again and again until satisfied, prints, photocopies, turns the
results over to a bindery, and winds up with the latest of several
handsome booklets with blue or purple or red covers, puckishly
decorated by their author. Presto, a twenty-first-century descendant
of the Elizabethan chapbook.

The contents? Modern variations of Greek and Indian myths, "cynical"
(but actually quite poignant) Christmas stories, short fiction about
Americans in Paris in the 1960s, factual reports on scientific
conferences, ruminations on the state of current academia, horror
stories of the homeless, book reviews, farces, musings on the latest
developments in physics, and one of the most unsparing and tacitly
poignant autobiographies I have ever read.

Whose autobiography? That of Roy Lisker, onetime math prodigy,
ex-wandering musician, contributor to JeanPaul Sartre's Les Temps
Modernes, and local character in a succession of places (mostly
university communities), political protestor and prankster, and
indefatigable self-publisher.

Unless you are Noam Chomsky or historian Howard Zinn or composers
Milton Babbitt and John Harbison or one of the other subscribers to
Lisker's monthly publication, Ferment, you will have to take my word
for it that Roy is worth reading for the way he can make a fictional
character as rooted in the real world as the subject of a New Yorker
profile, while endowing a real-life academic with the fabulousness of
a character in Dickens. If there were any literary justice in the
world, Linker's story, "Sam, The Messiah Man," about a violinist who
devotes his entire career to perfecting the violin passages of a
Handel oratorio, would be as renowned as Borges's fable about another
artistic specialist, "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote." But what
really concerns me here is to point out how tenaciously Lisker reverts
to the seemingly outmoded notion of the writer as local character and
streetcorner vendor of news, satire, and fantasy. To be sure, Lisker
has been conventionally published (his academic satire, Getting That
Meal Ticket, was published in Paris by Rend Juliard in 1972), but he
now confines his energies to using his private printing press in the
Russell Library, hawking his wares on the Wesleyan campus, giving
readings at local bookstores, and mailing his publications to
subscribers who are all over the country because Roy, in his youth,
had been all over the country befriending and bugging people while
enacting his role of academic-mathematician- wandering minstrel.

Hello Cat Community,


    I would like a clear exposition of the relationship between
quantifiers and their corresponding adjoints (so I can understand this
relationship). In particular, I would to understand how Lawvere came to
this insight. Which book, publication. etc. will best help me to
understand this very important relationship?

Dear Colleagues,

This is to inform you that a small website has been created for the
purpose of collecting and distributing research devoted to algebraic
set theory.  Following on the Joyal & Moerdijk monograph by the same
name, people in several different locations have begun pursuing
related research.  It is hoped that linking these efforts will
encourage collaboration and make it easier for those new to the field
to gain easy access.

The site is located at:

http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/ast/

We hope to make more of the papers listed in the bibliography
available on the site soon, and to augment the listings with brief
descriptions.  Please contact me or "webmaster" Michael Warren
<mwarren@andrew.cmu.edu> if you would like to have your name,
homepage, and/or research listed.

See (some of) you in Vancouver!

Steve Awodey

Dear categorists,

The category of ordinary MLL proof nets (where an object is a term,
and a morphism X -> Y is a cut-free proof net for |- X^, Y) is the
free unitless *-autonomous category generated by the literals.

Does the corresponding result hold for MALL? The Hughes-van Glabeek
notion of MALL proof net has the ring of truth about it, and indeed
they claim to have proven (theorem 4.22) that "two cut-free MALL
proofs translate to the same proof net iff they can be converted into
each other by a series of rule commutations". Of course the category
of MALL proof nets is a unitless *-autonomous category with binary
products and coproducts, but nowhere (to my knowledge) is it described
as the *free* such category.

Is that because it isn't, or merely because it isn't (yet) known to be?
Enlightenment will be much appreciated.

Yours,
Robin

Does anyone here know the origin of the "Whitehead conjecture"?  I mean the
one saying every group G with Ext(G,Z)=0 is free.  Did Whitehead himself
consider this, or did it arise by generalizing his ideas?  Did he expect it
to be true, or just wonder about it?

best, Colin

The proceedings of the conference held in September 2002 at the Fields
Institute in Toronto are now available with the AMS. The 570-page volume
is entitled "Galois Theory, Hopf Algebras, and Semiabelian Categories"
(edited by George Janelidze, Bodo Pareigis, and Walter Tholen). See

http://www.ams.org/bookstore?fn=20&arg1=whatsnew&item=FIC-43

for more information.

A much smaller collection of papers especially devoted to categorical
descent theory will appear (hopefully later this year) as an issue of
"Applied Categorical Structures" (Kluwer).

This isn't definitive, but I think it is approximately correct.  The
connection between Ext(G,Z)=0 and G being free seems to have first appeared as
a reformulation by Henri Cartan of a result of Karl Stein which arose from his
work on the "second Cousin problem" in several complex variables.  The
reference to the paper and review is:

@article {MR13:224f,
    AUTHOR = {Stein, Karl},
     TITLE = {Analytische {F}unktionen mehrerer komplexer {V}er\"anderlichen
              zu vorgegebenen {P}eriodizit\"atsmoduln und das zweite
              {C}ousinsche {P}roblem},
   JOURNAL = {Math. Ann.},
    VOLUME = {123},
      YEAR = {1951},
     PAGES = {201--222},
   MRCLASS = {30.0X},
  MRNUMBER = {13,224f},
MRREVIEWER = {H. Cartan},
}

Whitehead appears to have first posed the question (it doesn't seem to have
been a conjecture) at a conference in Warsaw in 1952.  The Whitehead problem
seems to have been first published by A. Ehrenfeucht in 1955:

@article {MR16:994b,
    AUTHOR = {Ehrenfeucht, A.},
     TITLE = {On a problem of {J}. {H}. {C}. {W}hitehead concerning
              {A}belian groups},
   JOURNAL = {Bull. Acad. Polon. Sci. Cl. III.},
    VOLUME = {3},
      YEAR = {1955},
     PAGES = {127--128},
   MRCLASS = {20.0X},
  MRNUMBER = {16,994b},
MRREVIEWER = {P. A. Smith},
}

Fifteen months ago I announced to the list that my book,

   Higher Operads, Higher Categories,

was available on the web.  It is now out in traditional form too, in
the blue-green LMS Lecture Note Series (Cambridge University Press).
Details of both versions can be found at

   http://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~tl/book.html

The free web version will remain available permanently.

Those of you who came to my talk at CT04 will know that there is a
mistake on the front cover: take out your blue-green Tippex and paint
over the words "Edited by".

I've recently come across the following curious little result.  I know
how to prove it and have a use for it, but my question is: can anyone
supply a wider context or explanation?

The result is that the limit in Set of any diagram

   ... ---> S_3 ---> S_2 ---> S_1

of finite nonempty sets is nonempty.  Note that finiteness cannot be
dropped: for instance, take each S_n to be the natural numbers and
each map to be addition of 1.

Thanks,
Tom

I'm not sure whether this counts as an explanation, but it's certainly a
wider context: the result is a special case of the fact that a
(cofiltered) inverse limit of locales and proper maps maps properly to
each of the vertices of the diagram. See C3.2.11 in the Elephant, and
also C1.1.12. (And note that the result fails for spaces: thus a key part
of the argument in the finite case is that the inverse limit in Loc is
a spatial locale.)

It is purely a property of compactness.  Take the product of compact
spaces.  The condition of an element of the product being in the limit is
the conjunction of infinitely many conditions each of which says that two
coordinates agree and if it is a chain (or, in fact, an inverse filtered
diagram) of non-empty compact sets, each of those finitely many conditions
defines a closed non-empty subset with the finite intersection property.

So the general context is that an inverse filtered limit of non-empty
compact Hausdorff spaces is non-empty.  Although I don't seem to have used
Hausdorffness, it is required to show those sets are closed.  And without
it, you could get the example Tom described using the trivial topology,
which is certainly compact.  I guess you could use the finite complement
topology to get a T1 counterexample.

I asked for an explanation of the following result:

>
>    ... ---> S_3 ---> S_2 ---> S_1
>
> of finite nonempty sets is nonempty

Thanks very much to all who replied.  I'll summarize some of the points
made to me in private replies:

1. This is called Koenig's Lemma, and is usually stated in the form
   "any finitely-branching infinite tree contains an infinite
   (positively oriented) path".

2. This also follows from a general result in topology by regarding
   each S_n as a discrete space.  The general result is that any
   "suitably-shaped" limit of nonempty compact Hausdorff spaces is
   nonempty.  For Bourbaki (General Topology), "suitably-shaped" means
   indexed by a directed poset.  More generally still, it could be any
   componentwise cofiltered limit, i.e. any limit for which each
   connected-component of the indexing category I is cofiltered (or
   equivalently, every finite connected diagram in I admits a cone).

   The proof of the general topological result specializes to give a
   nice topological proof of Koenig.  For each n, let V_n be the
   subset of the product \prod_n S_n consisting of those sequences
   whose first n terms are compatible; then \lim_n S_n is the
   intersection of the (V_n)s.  But with the discrete topology on each
   S_n, Tychonoff says that \prod_n S_n is compact, and (V_n) is a
   nested sequence of nonempty closed subsets so has nonempty
   intersection.

Tom,
   The classical context I know is that in the category of compact
Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps, limits exist, and are non-empty
if each component space is non-empty. This uses the Axiom of Choice
(and the Tychonoff Theorem) to show that the product of the component
spaces $S_i$ is non-empty and compact. The generalization just embeds
Set in Top by regarding sets as discrete spaces, so all sets are
locally compact, and the compact sets are exactly the finite ones.
   The limit can be defined as the family
   $ L = \{ (s_i) \mid p_ji(s_j) = s_i, for i \leq j \in I\}. $
This limit is then the filtered intersection of the sets
   $T_F = \prod_{i \not\in F} S_i \times \{(s_i)_{i \in F} \mid
p_{ji}(s_j) = s_i, i \leq j \in F\},$
where $F\subseteq I$ is finite. The Axiom of Choice implies $F,
\prod_{i \not\in F} S_i$ is non-empty, and it's easy to show that
$\{(s_i)_{i \in F} \mid p_{ji}(s_j) = s_i, i \leq j \in F\}$ is
non-empty since $F$ is finite, so $T_F$ is non-empty. Since the bonding
maps $p_{ji} \colon S_j \to S_i$ are continuous, the set $T_F$ is
closed, so it's a non-empty closed subset of the compact Hausdorff
space $\prod_i S_i$. Since the family is filtered, its intersection is
non-empty.
   This generalization also suggests why the sets have to be finite -
limits of non-empty locally compact spaces and continuous maps can be
empty, because the limit object may be empty. Indeed, the same
construction as given above defines the limit object L, but L may be
empty because the filtered intersection of a family of closed,
non-empty subsets of a locally compact space may be empty.
   Best regards,
   Mike

This seems to me to be equivalent to Koenig's lemma: every infinite,
finitely branching tree has an infinite branch. The set of vertices is
the disjoint union of all the S_n, and there is an edge from (a,i) to
(b,i+1) if f_i(b)=a. Conversely, let S_n be the set of vertices at
depth n. -- Peter
