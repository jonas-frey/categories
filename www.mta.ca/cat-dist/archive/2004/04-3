I'm surprised no-one seems to have mentioned John Hobby's METAPOST
language. This is a mostly declarative language, with the capability of
solving linear equations. (So you can, for example, express that one item
appears halfway between two others, and that relationship will be
maintained as either endpoint moves.) It also integrates beautifully with
LaTeX. If you're neither a Picasso nor a Mondriaan, but you like writing
programs, I would have said this was the tool for you. Should come with
any decent TeX distribution.

Dear Categorists -

I've attempted to improve my web version of "week202" based on
Steve Schanuel's comments.  Here's the next issue, which contains
two different constructions by Robin Houston, both of which give a
"golden object" - i.e. an object G in some rig category, equipped
with an isomorphism between G and G^2 + 1.

Best,
jb

This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics - Week 203
John Baez

Last week I posed this puzzle: to find a "Golden Object".

A couple days ago I got a wonderful solution from Robin Houston, a computer
science grad student at the University of Manchester.  So, I want to say a
bit more about the golden number, then describe his solution, and then
describe how he found it.

Supposedly the Greeks thought the most beautiful rectangle was one such
that when you chop a square off one end, you're left with a rectangle
of the same shape.  If your original rectangle was 1 unit across and G
units long, after you chop a 1-by-1 square off the end you're left with
a rectangle that's G-1 units across and 1 unit long:

                                   G
                     .........................
                     .             .         .
                     .             .         .
                     .             .         .
                     .             .         .
                   1 .             .         . 1
                     .             .         .
                     .             .         .
                     .      1      .  G-1    .
                     .........................


So, to make the proportions of the little rectangle the same as those of
the big one, you want

"1 is to G as G-1 is to 1"

or in other words:

1/G = G - 1

or after a little algebra,

G^2 = G + 1

so that

G = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = 1.618033988749894848204586834365...

while

                1/G = 0.618033988749894848204586834365...

and

                G^2 = 2.618033988749894848204586834365...

(At this point I usually tell my undergraduates that the pattern
continues like this, with G^3 = 3.618... and so on - just to see if
they'll believe anything I say.)

These days, the number G is called the Golden Number, the Golden Ratio,
or the Golden Section.  It's often denoted by the Greek letter Phi,
after the Greek sculptor Phidias.  Phidias helped design the Parthenon -
and supposedly packed it full of golden rectangles, to make it as
beautiful as possible.

The golden number is a great favorite among amateur mathematicians, because
it has a flashy sort of charm.  You can find it all over the place if you
look hard enough - and if you look too hard, you'll find it even in places
where it's not.   It's the ratio of the diagonal to the side of a regular
pentagon!  If you like the number 5, you'll be glad to know that

            5 + sqrt(5)
  G = sqrt[-------------]
            5 - sqrt(5)

If you don't, maybe you'd prefer this:

  G = exp(arcsinh(1/2))

My favorite formulas for the golden number are

  G = sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + sqrt(1 + ...

and the continued fraction:

                   1
  G =    1  +  ---------
                1 +    1
                    --------
                    1 +  1
                        -------
                        1 +  1
                            ------
                            1 + 1
                               ----
                               1 + 1
                                  ----
                                     .
                                       .
                                         .

These follow from the equations G^2 = G + 1 and G = 1 + 1/G, respectively.
If you chop off the continued fraction for G at any point, you'll see that
G is also the limit of the ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers.   See
"week190" for a very different proof of this fact.

However, don't be fooled!  The charm of the golden number tends to attract
kooks and the gullible - hence the term "fool's gold".  You have to be
careful about anything you read about this number.  In particular, if you
think ancient Greeks ran around in togas philosophizing about the "golden
ratio" and calling it "Phi", you're wrong.  This number was named Phi
after Phidias only in 1914, in a book called _The Curves of Life_ by the
artist Theodore Cook.  And, it was Cook who first started calling 1.618...
the golden ratio.  Before him, 0.618... was called the golden ratio!  Cook
dubbed this number "phi", the lower-case baby brother of Phi.

In fact, the whole "golden" terminology can only be traced back to 1826,
when it showed up in a footnote to a book by one Martin Ohm, brother of
Georg Ohm, the guy with the law about resistors.  Before then, a lot of
people called 1/G the "Divine Proportion".  And the guy who started
*that* was Luca Pacioli, a pal of Leonardo da Vinci who translated Euclid's
Elements.  In 1509, Pacioli published a 3-volume text entitled Divina
Proportione, advertising the virtues of this number.  Some people think
da Vinci used the divine proportion in the composition of his paintings.
If so, perhaps he got the idea from Pacioli.

Maybe Pacioli is to blame for the modern fascination with the golden
ratio; it seems hard to trace it back to Greece.  These days you can buy
books and magazines about "Elliot Wave Theory", a method for making money
on the stock market using patterns related to the golden number.  Or, if
you're more spiritually inclined, you can go to workshops on "Sacred
Geometry" featuring talks about the healing powers of the golden ratio.
But Greek texts seem remarkably quiet about this number.

The first recorded hint of it is Proposition 11 in Book II of Euclid's
"Elements".  It also shows up elsewhere in Euclid, especially Proposition
30 of Book VI, where the task is "to cut a given finite straight line in
extreme and mean ratio", meaning a ratio A:B such that

A:B::(A+B):A                (i.e., "A is to B as A+B is to A")

This is later used in Proposition 17 of Book XIII to construct
the pentagonal face of a regular dodecahedron.

Of course, Euclid wasn't the first to do all these things; he just wrote
them up in a nice textbook.  By now it's impossible to tell who discovered
the golden ratio and just what the Greeks thought about it.  For a sane
and detailed look at the history of the golden ratio, try this:

1) J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson, The Golden Ratio,
http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Golden_ratio.html

While I'm at it, I should point out that you that Theodore Cook's
book introducing the notation "Phi" is still in print:

2) The Curves of Life: Being an Account of Spiral Formations and Their
Application to Growth in Nature, to Science, and to Art: with Special
Reference to the Manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci, Dover Publications,
New York, 1979.

If you want to see what Euclid said about the golden ratio, you can
also pick up a cheap copy of the Elements from Dover - but it's probably
quicker to go online.  There are a number of good places to find Euclid's
Elements online these days.

Topologists know David Joyce as the inventor of the "quandle" - an
algebraic structure that captures most of the information in a knot.
Now he's writing a high-tech edition of Euclid, complete with Java applets:

3) David E. Joyce's edition of Euclid's Elements,
http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/toc.html

Joyce is carrying on a noble tradition: back in 1847, Oliver Byrne did
a wonderful edition of Euclid complete with lots of beautiful color
pictures and even some pop-up models.  You can see this online at
the Digital Mathematics Archive:

4) Oliver Byrne's edition of Euclid's Elements, online at the Digital
Mathematics Archive, http://www.sunsite.ubc.ca/DigitalMathArchive/

The most famous scholarly English translation of Euclid was done by
Sir Thomas Heath in 1908.  You can find it together with an edition
in Greek and a nearly infinite supply of other classical texts at
the Perseus Digital Library:

5) Thomas L. Heath's edition of Euclid's Elements, online at
The Perseus Digital Library, http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/

But I'm digressing!  My main point was that while G = (1 + sqrt(5))/2
is a neat number, it's a lot easier to find nuts raving about it on the
net than to find truly interesting mathematics associated with it - or
even interesting references to it in Greek mathematics!  The cynic might
conclude that the charm of this number is purely superficial.  However,
that would be premature.

First of all, there's a certain sense in which G is "the most irrational
number".  To get the best rational approximations to a number you use its
continued fraction expansion.  For G, this converges as slowly as possible,
since it's made of all 1's:

                   1
     G =  1  +  ---------
                1 +    1
                    --------
                    1 +  1
                        -------
                        1 +  1
                            ------
                            1 + 1
                               ----
                               1 + 1
                                  ----
                                     .
                                       .
                                         .

We can make this more precise.  For any number x there's a constant
c(x) that says how hard it is to approximate x by rational numbers,
given by

        lim inf      |x - p/q|   = c(x)/q^2
      q -> infinity

where q ranges over integers, and p is an integer chosen to minimize
|x - p/q|.   This constant is as big as possible when x is the golden
ratio!

It'd be ironic if the famously "rational" Greeks, who according to legend
even drowned the guy who proved sqrt(2) was irrational, chose the most
irrational number as the proportions of their most beautiful rectangle!
But, it wouldn't be a coincidence.  Their obsession with ratios and
proportions led them to ponder the situation where A:B::(A+B):A,
and this proportion instantly implies that A and B are incommensurable,
since if you assume A and B are integers and try to find their greatest
common divisor using Euclid's algorithm, you get stuck in an infinite loop.
Euclid even mentions this idea in Proposition 2 of Book X:

 If, when the less of two unequal magnitudes is continually subtracted
 in turn from the greater that which is left never measures the one
 before it, then the two magnitudes are incommensurable.

He doesn't explicitly come out and apply it to what we now call the golden
ratio - but how could he not have made the connection?  For more info on
the Greek use of continued fractions and the Euclidean algorithm, check
out the chapter on "antihyphairetic ratio theory" in this book:

6) D. H. Fowler, The Mathematics of Plato's Academy: A New Reconstruction,
Oxford U. Press, Oxford, 1987.

Anyway, it's actually important in physics that the golden number is so
poorly approximated by rationals.   This fact shows up in the Kolmogorov-
Arnold-Moser theorem, or "KAM theorem", which deals with small perturbations
of completely integrable Hamiltonian systems.  Crudely speaking, these are
classical mechanics problems that have as many conserved quantities as
possible.  These are the ones that tend to show up in textbooks, like the
harmonic oscillator and the gravitational 2-body problem.   The reason is
that you can solve such problems if you can do a bunch of integrals - hence
the term "completely integrable".

The cool thing about a completely integrable system is that time evolution
carries states of the system along paths that wrap around tori.  Suppose
it takes n numbers to describe the position of your system.  Then it also
takes n numbers to describe its momentum, so the space of states is
2n-dimensional.  But if the system has n different conserved quantities -
that's basically the maximum allowed - the space of states will be foliated
by n-dimensional tori.  Any state that starts on one of these tori will
stay on it forever!  It will march round and round, tracing out a kind of
spiral path that may or may not ever get back to where it started.

Things are pretty simple when n = 1, since a 1-dimensional torus is a
circle, so the state *has* to loop around to where it started.  For example,
when you have a pendulum swinging back and forth, its position and momentum
trace out a loop as time passes.

When n is bigger, things get trickier.  For example, when you have n
pendulums swinging back and forth, their motion is periodic if the
ratios of their frequencies are rational numbers.

This is how it works for any completely integrable system.  For any torus,
there's an n-tuple of numbers describing the frequency with which paths on
this torus wind around in each of the n directions.  If the ratios of these
frequencies are all rational, paths on this torus trace out periodic orbits.
Otherwise, they don't!

KAM theory says what happens when you perturb such a system a little.
It won't usually be completely integrable anymore.   Interestingly, the
tori with rational frequency ratios tend to fall apart due to resonance
effects.  Instead of periodic orbits, we get chaotic motions instead.
But the "irrational" tori are more stable.  And, the "more irrational" the
frequency ratios for a torus are, the bigger a perturbation it takes to
disrupt it!  Thus, the most stable tori tend to have frequency ratios
involving the golden number.  As we increase the perturbation, the last
torus to die is called a "golden torus".

You can actually *watch* tori breaking into chaotic dust if you check out
the applet illustrating the "standard map" on this website:

7) Takashi Kanamaru and J. Michael T. Thompson, Introduction to Chaos
and Nonlinear Dynamics,
http://www.sekine-lab.ei.tuat.ac.jp/~kanamaru/Chaos/e/Standard/

The "standard map" is a certain dynamical system that's good for
illustrating this effect.  You won't actually see 2d tori, just
1d cross-sections of them - but it's pretty fun.  For more details,
try this:

8) M. Tabor, Chaos and Integrability in Nonlinear Dynamics: An Introduction,
Wiley, New York, 1989.

In short, the golden number is the best frequency ratio for avoiding
resonance!

Some audiophiles even say this means the best shaped room for listening
to music is one with proportions 1:G:G^2.  I leave it to you to find the
flaw in this claim.   For more dubious claims, check out the ad for expensive
speaker cables at the end of this article.

KAM theory is definitely cool, but we shouldn't rest content with this
when skeptics ask if the golden number is all it's cracked up to be.
I figure it's part of our job as mathematicians to keep on discovering
mind-blowing facts about the golden number.  A small part, but part:
we shouldn't give up the field to amateurs!

Penrose has done his share.  His "Penrose tiles" take crucial advantage
of the self-similarity embodied by the golden number to create nonperiodic
tilings of the plane.  This helped spawn a nice little industry, the study
of "quasicrystals" with 5-fold symmetry.  Here's a good introduction for
mathematicians:

9) Andre Katz, A short introduction to quasicrystallography, in From
Number Theory to Physics, eds. M. Waldschmit et al, Springer, Berlin,
1992, pp. 496-537.

By the way, this same book has some nice stuff on the role of the
golden number in KAM theory and the theory of iterated maps from
the circle to itself:

10) Predrag Cvitanovic, Circle maps: irrationally winding, in From
Number Theory to Physics, eds. M. Waldschmit et al, Springer, Berlin,
1992, pp. 631-658.

11) Jean-Christophe Yoccoz, Introduction to small divisors problems,
in From Number Theory to Physics, eds. M. Waldschmit et al, Springer,
Berlin, 1992, pp. 659-679.

Conway and Sloane are also pulling their weight.  Starting from the
relation between the golden ratio, the isosahedron, and the 4-dimensional
big brother of the icosahedron (the "600-cell"), they've described how
to construct the coolest lattices in 8 and 24 dimensions using "icosians" -
which are certain quaternions built using the golden ratio.   I discussed
this circle of ideas in "week20", "week59" and "week155".

But if you want some really scary formulas involving the golden ratio,
Ramanujan is the one to go to.  Check these out:


           1
      --------------
       1 +  exp(-2pi)
           -------------
            1 + exp(-4pi)       =  exp(2pi/5) [sqrt(G sqrt(5)) - G]
                ------------
                 1 + exp(-6pi)
                     -----------
                      1 + exp(-8pi)
                          ---------
                                 .
                                   .
                                     .

and


   1 +  exp(-2pi sqrt(5))
       -------------------
        1 + exp(-4pi sqrt(5))
            -----------------
             1 + exp(-6pi sqrt(5))
                 ------------------
                  1 + exp(-8pi sqrt(5))
                      ------------------
                              .
                                .
                                  .





                               sqrt(5)
=  exp(2pi/5) [ ------------------------------------- - G]
                1 + [5^{3/4} (G - 1)^{5/2} - 1]^{1/5}


These are special cases of a monstrosity called the Rogers-Ramanujan
continued fraction, which is a kind of "q-deformation" of the continued
fraction for the golden ratio.  For details, start here:

12) Eric W. Weisstein, Rogers-Ramanujan Continued Fraction,
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rogers-RamanujanContinuedFraction.html

The golden number also shows up in the theory of quantum groups.
I talked about this in "week22" so I won't explain it again here.
But, I can't resist mentioning that Freedman, Larsen and Wang have
subsequently shown that a certain topological quantum field theory
called Chern-Simons theory, built using the quantum group SU_q(2),
can serve as a universal quantum computer when the parameter q is a
fifth root of unity.  And, this is exactly the case where the spin-1/2
representation of SU_q(2) has quantum dimension equal to the golden number!

13) Michael Freedman, Michael Larsen, Zhenghan Wang,
A modular functor which is universal for quantum computation,
available at quant-ph/0001108.

But don't get the wrong idea: it's not that some magic feature of the
golden number is required to build a universal quantum computer!  It's
just that the 5 seems to be the *smallest* number n such that SU_q(2)
Chern-Simons theory is computationally universal when q is an nth root of 1.

That's pretty much everything I know about the golden number.  So now,
what about this "Golden Object" puzzle?

Basically, the problem was to find an object that acts like the golden
number.  The golden number has G = G^2 + 1, so we want to find
a object G equipped with a nice isomorphism between G and G^2 + 1.

If G is just a set, this means we want a nice one-to-one correspondence
between pairs of elements of G, and elements of G together with one other
It doesn't matter what that other thing is, so let's call it "@".

(You may be wondering about the word "nice".  The point is, the problem
is too easy if we don't demand that the solution be nice in some way -
some way that I don't feel like making precise.)

Here's Robin Houston's answer:

Define a "bit" to be either 0 or 1.  Define a "golden tree" to be a
(planar) binary tree with leaves labelled by 0, 1, or *, where every
node has at most one bit-child.  For example:

              /\   is a golden tree, but   /\   is not.
             /\ 1                         /\ *
            0  *                         0  1

Let G be the set of golden trees.  We define an isomorphism

f: G^2 -> G + {@}

as follows.  First we define f(X, Y) when both X and Y are golden
trees with just one node, this node being labelled by a bit.  We
can identify such a tree with a bit, and doing this we set

f(0, 0) = 0
f(0, 1) = 1
f(1, 0) = *
f(1, 1) = @

In the remaining case, where the golden trees X and Y are not just bits,
we set

f(X, Y) = /\
         X  Y

There are different ways to show this function f is a one-to-one
correspondence, but the best way is to see how Houston came up with
this answer!  He didn't just pull it out of a hat; he tackled the
problem systematically, and that's why his solution counts as "nice".

It's easy to find a set S equipped with an isomorphism

S = P(S)

where P is some polynomial with natural number coefficients.  You
just use the fixed-point principle described in "week108".  Namely,
you start with the empty set, keep hitting it with P forever, and take
a kind of limit.  This is how I built the set of binary trees last week,
as a solution of T = T^2 + 1.

The problem is that the isomorphism we seek now:

G^2 = G + 1                               (1)

is not of this form.  So, what Houston does is to make a substitution:

G = H + 2

Given this, we'd get (1) if we had

H^2 + 4H + 4 = H + 3                      (2)

and we'd get (2) if we had

H^2 + 4H + 1 = H                          (3)

which is of the desired form.

We can rewrite (3) as

H = 1 + H^2 + 2H + H2

and in English this says "an element of H is either a *, or
a pair consisting of two guys that are either bits or elements
of H - but not both bits".  So, a guy in H is a golden tree!
But, if it has just one node, that node can only be labelled
by a *, not a 0 or 1.  This means there are precisely 2 golden trees
not in H.  So, G = H + 2 is the set of all golden trees, and our
calculation above gives an isomorphism G^2 = G + 1.

Voila!

Note that to derive (3) from (1) we need to subtract, which in general
is not allowed in this game.  Here we are subtracting constants, and
Houston says that's allowed by the "Garsia-Milne involution theorem".
I don't know this theorem, so I'll make a note to myself to learn it.
But luckily, we don't really need it here: we only need to derive (1)
from (3), and that involves addition, so it's fine.

Part of what makes Houston's solution "nice" is that it suggests a
general method for turning polynomial equations into recursive definitions
of the form S = P(S).  Another nice thing is that his trick delivers
a structure type G(X) that reduces to G when X = 1.  To get this, first
use the fixed-point method to construct a structure type H(X) with an
isomorphism

H(X) = (H(X) + X)^2 + 2H(X)

Then, define

G(X) = H(X) + X + 1

and note that this gives

G(X)^2 = G(X) + X

which reduces to G^2 = G + 1 when X = 1.

As if this weren't enough, Houston also gave another solution to the
puzzle.  He showed that James Propp's proposed Golden Object, described
last week, really is a Golden Object!  Maybe Propp already knew this,
but I sure didn't.

The idea of the proof is pretty general.  Suppose we've got a category
that's a "2-rig" in the sense of "week191".  And, suppose we've got an
object X equipped with an isomorphism

X = 1 + 2X                                (4)

so that X acts like "-1".  For example, following Schanuel and Propp,
we can take the category of "sigma-polytopes" and let X be the open
interval: then isomorphism (4) says

(0,1) = (0,1/2) + {1/2} + (1/2,1)

Or, following Houston, we can take the category of sets and let X be
the set of finite bit-strings.  Then (4) says "a finite bit-string is
either the empty bit-string, or a bit followed by a finite bit-string".
The relation between these two examples is puzzling to me - if anyone
understands it, let me know!  But anyway, either one works.

Now let G be the object of "binary trees with X-labelled leaves":

G = X + X^2 + 2X^3 + 5X^4 + 14X^5 + 42X^6 + ...

where the coefficients are Catalan numbers.  Let's show that G is a
Golden Object.  To do this, we'll use (4) and this isomorphism:

G = G^2 + X                               (5)

which says "a binary tree with X-labelled leaves is a pair of such
trees, or a degenerate tree with just one X-labelled node".  The formula
for G involving Catalan numbers is really just the fixed-point solution
to this!

Here is Houston's fiendishly clever argument.  Suppose Z is any type
equipped with an isomorphism

Z = Z' + X

for some Z'.  Then

Z + X + 1 = Z' + 2X + 1
          = Z' + X
          = Z

This applies to Z = G^2, since

G^2 = (X + G^2)^2 = (2X + 1 + G^2)^2

has a X term in it when you multiply it out, so it's of the form Z' + X.
Therefore we have an isomorphism

G^2 = G^2 + X + 1

But we also have an isomorphism G + 1 = G^2 + X + 1 by (5).  Composing
these, we get our isomorphism

G^2 = G + 1.

Golden!  I'll stop here.

Quote of the week:

"As a high-end cable manufacturer, Cardas Audio strives to address every
detail of cable and conductor construction, no matter how small.  An
elegant solution deals with quality, not quantity.  Cable geometry problems
are resolved in the cable's design, not after the fact with filters.  George
Cardas received U.S. Patent Number 4,628,151 for creating Golden Section
Stranding Audio Cable.  It is truly unique.  George introduced the concept
of Golden Section Stranding to high-end audio, but the Golden Ratio,
1.6180339887... : 1, is as old as nature itself.  The Golden Ratio is the
mathematical proportion nature uses to shape leaves and sea shells, insects
and people, hurricanes and galaxies, and the heart of musical scales and
chords.  "Discovered" by the Greeks, but used by the Egyptians in the Great
Pyramid centuries before, man has employed the Golden Ratio to create his
most beautiful and naturally pleasing works of art and architecture." -

Greetings to all the readers. I am studying category theory
on my own and I did not succeed in finding an answer to
the following question.
Colimits can be defined in terms of universal arrows:
the colimit of a functor F: S -> C is the universal arrow,
in the category C^S, from F to the diagonal functor
D: C -> C^S. Can we also define universal arrows in
terms of colimits? If yes, how?

Thank you very much
Pietro Braione

The Editors are in the process of preparing a number of TAC Reprints that
will consist of a number of papers by Peter Freyd that were circulated but
never published.  The papers will be individually refereed and when ready
this number will appear. In the meantime, as papers are approved they will
be posted temporarily at

ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr/abcat/

The first such paper has now been posted under the name homotopy.pdf.
It is the one that shows that the homotopy category is not concrete.

Categorification is a bit like quantization:  it isn't a construction so much
as a desideratum for a relationship between one thing and another (in the
case of categorification an (n+1)-categorical structure and an n-categorical
structure; in the case of quantization a quantum mechanical system and
a classical mechanical system).

Categorification wants to find a higher-dimensional categorical structure
corresponding to a lower-dimensional one by weakening equations to
natural isomorphisms and imposing new, sensible, coherence conditions.
In general, for the original purpose for which it was proposed--constructions
of TQFT's and models of quantum gravity--one wants the highest categorical
level to have a linear structure (hence Baez wanting tensor product
and a sum it distributes over, rather than cartesian product and coproduct).
Specific lower-dimensional categories with structure are 'categorified' by
finding a higher-dimensional category with the new structure which 'lies over'
the lower dimensional one in the way an additive monoidal category lies
over its Grothendieck rig.

For instance any (k-linear) monoidal category with monoid of isomorphism
classes M is a categorification of M, and more generally (k-linear) monoidal
categories are a categorification of monoids.

A simple example shows why it is not a construction:  commutative monoids
(as rather special categories with one object) admit two different
categorifications:  symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal
categories (each regarded as a kind of bicategory with one object).
There is a good argument for regarding braided monoidal categories
as the 'correct' categorification:  the Eckmann-Hilton theorem ('a group
in GROUPS is an abelian group'  or, really as the proof shows, 'a monoid
in MONOIDS is a commutative monoid') 'categorifies' to: A monoidal category
in MONCAT is a braided monoidal category.

               Apologies to those who receive multiple copies of this
announcement

Dear Colleagues,
  This is the Second Announcement of the Twentieth Workshop on the
Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics and a Call for
Participation at the meeting. MFPS 20 will be held on the campus of
Carnegie Mellon University from May 23 through May 26 of this year. The
meeting will be co-located with the Annual Meeting of the Association of
Symbolic Logic, which will take place at CMU from May 19 through midday,
May 23. MFPS 20 will feature invited lectures by:
  o Christel Baier (Bonn)
  o Radha Jagadeesan (DePaul)
  o Pat Lincoln (SRI)
  o Luke Ong (Oxford)
  o Dana Scott (CMU)
  o Alex Simpson (Edinbrgh)
Each invited talk will have an accompanying special session focusing on
the topic of the plenary talk, and featuring talks by a number of
leading researchers in the area.
  Noting that this is the 20th anniversary of MFPS, we are planning a
panel discussion for one evening of the meeting. Details about this will
be forthcoming later.
  Slots for contributed talks are available for those who wish to
contribute a talk These slots will be allocated on a first come, first
serve basis. If you are interested in giving a talk at the meeting, send
an email to mfps@math.tulane.edu with the title and abstract. Also
indicate if the talk would be appropriate for one of the special
sessions. The deadline for submitting a title and abstract is April 1,
2004.
  We anticipate support from the US Office of Naval Research, and a
portion of that support is reserved to help defray the expenses of
women, minorities and graduate students to attend the meeting. If you
need some support to attend the meeting and are a member of one of these
groups, please send an email to mfps@math.tulane.edu describing your
needs. Because these funds are limited, we are unable to underwrite the
full cost of participation at the meeting, so we expect requests that
address a portion of the costs.
  To access more details about the meeting, please point your browser at
http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps20.htm where you also will find a
link to the Registration Page for the conference. The latter contains
information about hotel accommodations in addition to a registration
form that can be submitted online.
  MFPS 20 is collaborating with ASL to encourage participants to attend
both meetings. In particular, participants at MFPS 20 will have access
to the ASL meetings on Saturday, May 22. A link the to the ASL meeting
information is accessible on the MFPS Home Page.
  MFPS is organized by Achim Jung (Birmingham), Stephen Brookes (CMU),
Catherine Meadows (NRL), Michael Mislove (Tulane) and Prakash Panangaden
(McGill).

A fair question.  I attended John's Coimbra lectures on this stuff in 1999
but a lot of it leaked out afterwards.  If I had to guess I'd say he was
categorifying the free monoid on one generator to make it a monoidal category,
but then how did the monoid end up as coproduct and the generator as the
final object?  One suspects some free association there---John, how *do*
you make that connection?

With regard to categorification in general, sets seem to play a central
role in at least one development of category theory.  The homobjects of
"ordinary" categories are homsets.  (In that sense I guess "ordinary" must
entail "locally small.")  2-categories are what you get if instead you let
them be homcats, suitably elaborated.

Going in the other direction, if you take homsets to be vacuous, not
in the sense that they are empty but rather that they are all the same,
then you get sets.  One more step in that direction makes everything look
the same, which may have something to do with the Maharishi Yogi hiring
category theorists for the math dept. of his university in Fairfield, Iowa.
(When I spoke last with the MY's "Minister of World Health," an MD who like
Ross Street was a classmate of mine but eight years earlier starting in 1957,
the entire conversation seemed to be largely a skirting of the minefield
of the sameness of everything, which may subconsciously have been behind my
obscure reply to Peter Freyd's posting a while back about unique existence
going back to Descartes, where I tried to one-up him by claiming it went
*much* further back.)

Categorification isn't the only way to get to 2-categories, which can be
understood instead in terms of the interchange law as a two-dimensional
associativity principle.  However John has got a lot of mileage out of
the categorification approach, which one can't begrudge in an era where
mileage and minutes are as integral to a balanced life as one's checkbook.
(Q: How many minutes in a month?  A: Depends on your plan.)

Quite right.  I would add to this "and satisfying the expected equations."
The "nasty sets" of which Steve speaks fail to satisy such expected
equations as 2^2^X ~ X.  (The power set of a set is a Boolean algebra,
for heaven's sake.  Why on earth forget that structure prior to taking the
second exponentiation?  Set theorists seem to think that they can simply
forget structure without paying for it, but in the real world it costs
kT/2 joules per element of X to forget that structure.  If set theorists
aren't willing to pay real-world prices in their modeling, why should we
taxpayers pay them real-world salaries?  Large cardinals are a figment of
their overactive imaginations, and the solution to consistency concerns is
not to go there.)

    I was unable to understand John Baez' golden object problem, nor his
description of the solutions. He refuses to tell us what 'nice' means,
but let me at least propose that to be 'tolerable' a solution must be an
object in a category, and John doesn't tell us what category is involved
in either of the solutions; at least I couldn't find a specification of
the objects, nor the maps, so I found the descriptions 'intolerable', in
the technical sense defined above. He is very generous, allowing one to
use a category with both plus and times as extra monoidal structures.
(Does anyone know an example of interest in which the plus is not
coproduct?) This freedom is unnecessary; a little algebra plus Robbie
Gates' theorem provides a solution G to  G^2=G+1 which satisfies no
additional equations, in an extensive category (with coproduct as plus,
cartesian product as times).
    Briefly, here it is. A primitive fifth root of unity z is a root of
the polynomial 1+X+X^2+X^3+X^4, hence satisfies 1+z+z^2+z^3+z^4+z=z,
which is of the 'fixed point' form p(z)=z with p in N[X] and p(0) not
0. Gates' theorem then says that the free distributive category
containing an object Z and an isomorphism from p(Z) to Z is extensive,
and its Burnside rig B (of isomorphism classes of objects) is, as one
would hope, N[X]/(p(X)=X); that is, Z satisfies no unexpected
equations. Since the degree of p is greater than 1, an easy general
theorem tells us (from the joint injectivity of the Euler and dimension
homomorphisms) that two polynomials agree at the object Z if and only if
either they are the same polynomial or both are non-constant and they
agree at the number z.Now the 'algebra':  the golden number is 1+z+z^4.
So G=1+Z+Z^4 satisfies G^2=G+1, as desired. It satisfies no
unexpected equations, because the relation X^2=X+1 reduces any
polynomial in N[X] to a linear polynomial, and these reduced forms have
distinct Euler characteristics, i.e. differ at z. Thus the homomorphism
from N[X]/(X^2=X+1) to B (sending X to G) is injective, and that's all
I wanted.
    Since in the category of sets, any nasty old infinite set satisfies
the golden equation and many others, I have taken the liberty of
interpreting  'nice' to mean at least 'satisfying no unexpected
equations'. One could ask for more; the construction above has produced
a distributive, but not extensive, category whose Burnside rig is
N[X]/(X^2=X+1), the full subcategory with objects polynomials in G.
(If it were extensive, it would be closed under taking summands, but
every object in the larger category is a summand of G.) I don't know
whether there is an extensive category with N[X]/(X^2=X+1) as its full
Burnside rig; perhaps one or both of the examples John mentioned would
do, if I knew what they were.
    While I'm airing my confusions, can anyone tell me what

exanple, 'categorifying' natural numbers to get finite sets, seems to me
rather 'remembering the finite sets and maps which gave rise to natural

Here are two examples that I've come across previously of rig categories
in which the plus is not coproduct:

(i) the category of finite sets and bijections, with + and x inherited
from the category of sets;

(ii) discrete rig categories, which are of course the same thing as
rigs.

If you *do* allow yourself the freedom to use any rig category then an
even simpler solution exists, also satisfying no additional equations:
just take the rig freely generated by an element G satisfying G^2 = G +
1 and regard it as a discrete rig category.

I'd interpret "nice" differently.  (Apart from anything else, the
trivial example in my previous paragraph would otherwise make the golden
object problem uninteresting.)  "Nice" as I understand it is not a
precise term - at least, I don't know how to make it precise.  Maybe I
can explain my interpretation by analogy with the equation T = 1 + T^2.
A nice solution T would be the set of finite, binary, planar trees
together with the usual isomorphism T -~-> 1 + T^2; a nasty solution
would be a random infinite set T with a random isomorphism to 1 + T^2.
(Both these solutions are in the rig category Set with its standard +
and x.)  I regard the first solution as nice because I can see some
combinatorial content to it (and maybe, at the back of my mind, because
it has a constructive feel), and the second as nasty because I can't.
I'm not certain what I think of the solution given by the set of
not-necessarily-finite binary planar trees (nice?), or by the set of
binary planar trees of cardinality at most aleph_5 (probably nasty).

Maybe the finding of a "nice" solution is similar in spirit to the
finding of a "concrete interpretation" of a combinatorial identity.  As
an extremely simple example, consider the identity saying that each
entry in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two above it,

   (n+1 choose r) = (n choose r-1) + (n choose r).

This is a doddle to prove, but all the same you'd be missing something
if you didn't know the standard "concrete interpretation": choosing r
objects out of n+1 objects amounts to EITHER choosing the first one and
then choosing r-1 of the remaining n OR ... .  Even if the challenge of
finding a "nice solution" or "concrete interpretation" isn't made
precise, I think there is a shared sense of what would count as an
answer, and finding an answer is in general not straightforward.

Best wishes,
Tom

The University of Glasgow is hiring four Lecturers in Mathematics.  Some
of these appointments may be at the Senior Lecturer level.  Details are
at

http://www.jobs.ac.uk/jobfiles/PK506.html

As I only started here myself in October, maybe I can say some things
that will be useful to people thinking of applying.  I've found the
department a very pleasant place to be.  As well as Richard Steiner and
me in category theory, there are a lot of algebraists (one of the
largest algebra groups in the UK), a good bunch of topologists and
geometers, and (best of all) a lot of interaction between the different
groups.  For example, last term there was a study group/"working
seminar" on model categories run by the algebraic topologists.  There
are plenty of people around with whom a category theorist can have a
meaningful mathematical conversation, and I've yet to meet anyone here
who makes me feel like an alien (as sometimes happens).  So despite
there not being a large category theory group as such (yet), I've felt
no sense of intellectual isolation.  And as you can see from the rate
we're hiring, there's a lot of fresh blood coming in.

Glasgow is the fourth-oldest university in the UK, after St Andrew's and
two places whose names I forget.  Glasgow was 1990 European city of
culture, 1999 UK city of architecture and design, and 2003 European
capital of sport.  I am told that we also have the tallest cinema in
Europe.

If you want any further information then feel free to get in touch.

Dear Categorists -

Sorry to take a while to respond.  People at UCR have been unable to
receive posts on the category theory mailing list, due to problems with
our internet connection.

I'd asked for some nice examples of an object G in a rig category
equipped with an isomorphism from G to G^2 + 1.  Steve Schanuel replied:

>I was unable to understand John Baez' golden object problem, nor his
>description of the solutions.  He refuses to tell us what 'nice' means, [...]

The problem was deliberately open-ended, but you seem to have
understood it perfectly, since you've given a nice solution,
including a precise specification of what you consider "nice".

Let me repeat the two solutions given by Robin Houston:

1) The first solution works in any rig category having an object H
equipped with an isomorphism to H^2 + 4H + 1.  The solution is to take

G = H + 2.

I described how Houston uses the isomorphism H -> H^2 + 4H + 1 to
construct an isomorphism G^2 -> G + 1.

What's nice about this is that it reduces a problem that's not
obviously of fixed-point form to one that is.

2) Houston's second solution works in any monoidal cocomplete category,
tensor product distributing over colimits, that contains an object X
equipped with an isomorphism to 2X + 1.  The solution is to let G be
the object of "binary planar rooted trees with X-labelled leaves", i.e.

G = X + X^2 + 2X^3 + 5X^4 + 14X^5 + 42X^6 + ...

where the coefficients are Catalan numbers.  He uses the obvious
isomorphism G -> G^2 + X to construct an isomorphism G^2 -> G + 1.

What's nice about this is that it shows Propp's originally proposed
golden object really is one: just take the category of sigma-polytopes
with its cartesian product, and let X be the open interval!  And,
it makes precise the sense in which the alternating sum of Catalan
numbers equals the golden ratio.

Steve writes:

>I don't know whether there is an extensive category with N[X]/(X^2=X+1)
>as its full Burnside rig; perhaps one or both of the examples John
>mentioned would do, if I knew what they were.

I think example 1) does the job if we take the free distributive
category on an object H equipped with an isomorphism to H^2 + 4H + 1.
Right?

Steve also writes:

>He is very generous, allowing one to use a category with both plus
>and times as extra monoidal structures.  (Does anyone know an example
>of interest in which the plus is not coproduct?)  This freedom is
>unnecessary [...]

It's unnecessary, but handy: I think there's also an golden object in
the rig category of reps of quantum SU(2) at a suitable value of q.
Here the tensor product is not cartesian.

In the lingo of quantum group theory, this object has "quantum dimension"
equal to the golden number.  It's interesting how such nonintegral but
algebraic "dimensions" show up naturally in quantum group theory,
just as nonintegral but algebraic "cardinalities" show up in the theory
of distributive categories.

I don't know any golden objects in rig categories where the plus is
not coproduct, and I agree that such rig categories arise less often
than those where times is not product.  But, if you use the obvious
way of making the groupoid of finite sets into a rig category, + isn't
coproduct, nor is x product.

You're right: categorification is not a systematic process!
I explained this idea back in "week121", and also in my paper
"Categorification", at http://www.arXiv.org/abs/math.QA/9802029.
Here's what I said.

 If one studies categorification one soon discovers an amazing fact: many
 deep-sounding results in mathematics are just categorifications of facts
 we learned in high school!  There is a good reason for this.  All along,
 we have been unwittingly `decategorifying' mathematics by pretending
 that categories are just sets.  We `decategorify' a category by
 forgetting about the morphisms and pretending that isomorphic objects
 are equal.  We are left with a mere set: the set of isomorphism classes
 of objects.

 To understand this, the following parable may be useful.  Long ago, when
 shepherds wanted to see if two herds of sheep were isomorphic, they
 would look for an explicit isomorphism.  In other words, they would line
 up both herds and try to match each sheep in one herd with a sheep in
 the other.  But one day, along came a shepherd who invented
 decategorification.  She realized one could take each herd and `count'
 it, setting up an isomorphism between it and some set of `numbers',
 which were nonsense words like `one, two, three, ...' specially
 designed for this purpose.  By comparing the resulting numbers, she
 could show that two herds were isomorphic without explicitly
 establishing an isomorphism!  In short, by decategorifying the category
 of finite sets, the set of natural numbers was invented.

 According to this parable, decategorification started out as a stroke
 of mathematical genius.  Only later did it become a matter of dumb
 habit, which we are now struggling to overcome by means of
 categorification.  While the historical reality is far more
 complicated, categorification really has led to tremendous progress
 in mathematics during the 20th century.  For example, Noether
 revolutionized algebraic topology by emphasizing the importance of
 homology groups.  Previous work had focused on Betti numbers, which
 are just the dimensions of the rational homology groups.  As with
 taking the cardinality of a set, taking the dimension of a vector
 space is a process of decategorification, since two vector spaces are
 isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.  Noether noted
 that if we work with homology groups rather than Betti numbers, we can
 solve more problems, because we obtain invariants not only of spaces,
 but also of maps.

 In modern language, the nth rational homology is a *functor* defined
 on the *category* of topological spaces, while the nth Betti number is
 a mere *function*, defined on the *set* of isomorphism classes of
 topological spaces.  Of course, this way of stating Noether's insight
 is anachronistic, since it came before category theory.  Indeed, it
 was in Eilenberg and Mac Lane's subsequent work on homology that
 category theory was born!

 Decategorification is a straightforward process which typically
 destroys information about the situation at hand.  Categorification,
 being an attempt to recover this lost information, is inevitably
 fraught with difficulties.

I hope it's clearer now.

Best,
jb

It should have been "from G^2 to G + 1".

I will answer you in a Popperian key:  Large cardinals are falsifiable,
and are not yet falsified.  They may in fact be figments of our imaginations,
but then why do they keep on *working*?  Could be just a coincidence -- but
so could all other observation; that way lies the nullification of science
in general.

It's an illusion, by the way, to think that you can be rid of concerns about
consistency by dumping large cardinals, that you can thus achieve a priori
justification for apodictic certainty.  That doesn't exist even for the
natural numbers; Ed Nelson is quite right on this point.

As to the question of taxpayer funding, I will not attempt to justify
it (I'm a libertarian in politics), but will merely note that many
taxpayers probably feel that way about *all* pure mathematics.

Dear Vaughan,

I like it!

But there's still the question of just what structure the power set has.
Constructively it's not a Boolean algebra in general, though it is a frame.

And is it even a set? You can in fact only say that by removing the
structure, which is exactly what you told the set-theorists not to do.
And in this instance it's arguable. Topos theorists say it is a set,
predicative type theorists say it isn't.

Part of the structure of the power "set" is topological - the Scott
topology, with the inclusion order as its specialization order. But to
formalize it as topological space, point-set + topological structure,
you again have to forget structure in order to get a point-set. Taking
this seriously generally brings you to point-free topology in some form
or other.

Steve Vickers.

I have just put on the web two papers that explore constructive localic
(and also topos) aspects of Lawvere's generalized metric spaces (see TAC
Reprints 1, "Metric spaces, generalized logic and closed categories").
My papers are:

   "Localic completion of generalized metric spaces I"
   "Localic completion of generalized metric spaces II: Powerlocales"

They can both be found through

   http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/README.html

Lawvere describes generalized metric spaces as categories enriched over
the extended half line [0, infinity]. I replace this enrichment category
by a locale with the same points, and show how to obtain a completion as
a locale. Topos aspects include a proof that the generic localic
completion is an opfibration in the 2-category of grothendieck toposes.

My second paper shows how the powerlocales of the localic completions
are themselves also localic completions, and uses this to analyse
questions of compactness.

 From a computer science point of view, both the first "nice" solution
(finite binary trees) and the second "nice?" solution (possibly
non-finite
binary trees) are canonical, in the sense that the first is the carrier
of the
initial algebra for the endofunctor 1+X^2 on Set,  while the second is
the
carrier of its final coalgebra.

All the best,
Pawel.

aspects of the following:

* Coalgebras and computing
* Concurrent and distributed systems
* Constructive mathematics
* Declarative programming and term rewriting
* Domain theory and topology
* Foundations of computer security
* Linear logic
* Modal and temporal logics
* Models of computation
* Program logics, data refinement, and specification

FIRST GRADUATE STUDENT SUMMER SCHOOL, August 9-11.

Inspired by the success of the graduate student preconference of
CTCS'02 in Ottawa, the CTCS of this year will have a graduate student
summer school from August 9-11, sponsored by the FIRST graduate school
(www.first.dk).  The goal is to prepare students (with basic knowledge
of category theory) for CTCS, through mini-courses in the basic areas
underlying some of the fields of the conference. The school will offer
the following mini-courses (5 lectures each):

    * Coalgebras, Modal Logic and Stone Duality (Lecturer: Alexander Kurz)
    * Game Semantics (Lecturer: Guy McCusker)
    * Operational Semantics (Lecturer: Pawel Sobocinski)
    * Categorical Models for Concurrency (Lecturer: Thomas Hildebrandt)

Registration Deadline: July 1st.


CMCIM WORKSHOP, August 11.

In between the summer school and the CTCS conference, August 11th,
there will be a half-day workshop on Categorical Methods in
Concurrency, Interaction and Mobility. The workshop has previously
been held in connection with CONCUR 2002 and CONCUR 2003.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts (less than 5 pages),
presenting recent results, challenges or work in progress. There will
be no formal proceedings of the workshop, informal proceedings will be
distributed at the workshop. Thus, accepted material may be published
elsewhere at a later date.

Workshop participation is *free*, but requires registration.

Registration is done by sending an email to hilde@itu.dk, containing
`CMCIM2004-registration' in the subject, and your full name and
institution in the body.

Submissions should be sent as PostScript files to: hilde@itu.dk,
containing `CMCIM-submission' in the subject, and in the body the full
names of the author(s), title, and a text-only abstract.

Workshop Organizers:

  Thomas Hildebrandt
  Alexander Kurz


CMCIM Workshop Registration Deadline: July 1st.
CMCIM Workshop Submission Deadline: June 21th.

I've got to do some publicity for funding agencies on a grant I have
that uses Kan extensions. I've been told that they like pictures (as
opposed to diagrams). So, does anyone have a picture of Daniel Kan?

I tried his web page but it is rather minimal and without an email
address

The hopf archive has a couple:

This one has (left to right) Bill Singer, George Whitehead, Dan Kan
and someone else that looks familiar.  It's from 1980 at Cornell.

  http://hopf.math.purdue.edu/pictures/kan.gif

This one has Charles Rezk and Dan Kan.  1995 or 1996, MIT:

  http://hopf.math.purdue.edu/pictures-95-96/mit/resk-kan.jpg

It you write to Clarence Wilkerson (the maintainer of hopf,
wilker at math purdue edu) or to Phil Hirschhorn (close friend
of Kan's, sees him daily, psh at math mit edu) you might be
able to dig up better pictures.

I would like some references to model structures on the category of
toposes/locales (thinking of them as generalized spaces), perhaps even
the category of internal toposes of a given (boolean?) topos. What I
know of is about model structures on the category of simplicial objects
in a topos.

Along the same lines, does it make sense to ask about ``internally
simplicial objects'' in a topos with an NNO (i.e., do such toposes have an
internal category that looks like the category of internally ``finite sets
with linear order and order preserving maps'')?

Call for Papers for CONCUR 2004

CONCUR 2004, the 15th International Conference on Concurrency Theory,
takes place at the Royal Society, London, Tuesday 31 August - Friday 3
September 2004. As well as the main event, we will also hold many
workshops on Monday 30th August and Saturday 4th February, as detailed
below.  Further information is available at the conference's web site

                   http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/concur2004

Important dates
       Submission: Friday 9 April 2004 (submission is now open)
       Notification: Monday 31 May 2004
       Final version: Tuesday 15 June 2004

The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers and students in order to advance the theory of
concurrency, and promote its applications. Interest in this topic is
continuously growing, as a consequence of the importance and ubiquity
of concurrent systems and their applications, and of the scientific
relevance of their foundations.

Submissions are solicited in all areas of semantics, logics and
verification techniques for concurrent systems. Principal topics
include (but are not limited to): - Basic models and logics of
concurrent and distributed computation (such as process algebras,
Petri nets, domain theoretic or game theoretic models, modal and
temporal logics).  - Specialized or enriched models (such as circuits,
synchronous systems, real time and hybrid systems, stochastic systems,
data bases, mobile and migrating systems, parametric protocols,
security protocols).  - Related verification techniques and tools
(such as state-space exploration, model-checking, synthesis,
abstraction, automated deduction, testing).  - Related programming
models (such as distributed, constraints or object oriented, graph
rewriting, as well as associated type systems, static analyses,
abstract machines, and environments).

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract not exceeding 15
pages electronically via the web submission form at the conference's
web site.  Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee
for inclusion in the proceedings, which will be published by
Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
series. Papers must contain original contributions, be clearly
written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison with
related work.  Simultaneous submissions to other conferences are not
allowed.

There will be a special issue of the journal Theoretical Computer
Science associated with Concur 2004.

Thanks to Christopher Townsend and Carsten Butz for help on cohomology in
an elementary topos.  It seems the general theory is not much advanced
beyond what it was in Johnstone 1977.

My question came out of a conversation with algebraic geometers several
years ago, which I have taken up again lately.  Deligne, for example,
describes toposes as one of Grothendieck's great ideas (one of
Grothendieck's four "idees maitresses").  But for him and many other
geometers their value lies in organizing cohomology.  Insofar as
Grothendieck toposes support a simple general theory of cohomology, and
elementary toposes do not, these people find only Grothendieck toposes
interesting.

Certainly there is a lot to say for elementary topos theory even from that
perspective:  The elementary topos axioms organize the theory of
Grothendieck toposes.  Elementary toposes have some cohomology theory
though not so simple and general.  And elementary toposes have other
roles.

What interests me, now, is how far elementary topos theory helps with
cohomology per se.

One approach is to notice:  The elementary theory of "a topos whose
Abelian groups have enough injectives" supports a considerable general
theory of cohomology via injective resolutions.  But I have not worked out
how far it really goes.  (People with foundational interests will notice
the exact result depends on whether and how this theory works with
infinite complexes.  There are various approaches depending on what you
mean by "elementary".)


This raises my first technical question:

SGA 4 proves inverse image functors preserve flat modules, but the
transparent proof assumes enough points (Exp. V Prop. 1.7).  Deligne gives
a far from transparent proof, for all (Grothendieck) toposes, in an
appendix on "local inductive limits".  He urges the reader "to avoid, as a
matter of principle, reading this appendix".  Is the result proved more
simply somewhere?  Do "local inductive limits" survive today in some form?
In short, can we follow Deligne's advice on not reading this appendix, and
still prove his result?  I have made no progress on the appendix yet, as
the opening definition is full of typos.  If there is a cleaner exposition
I'd rather start with that.

The second question:

The IHES version of SGA 4 gives a faulty proof that, in every
(Grothendieck) topos, rings admit a standard kind of resolution over any
cover by tensoring with a resolution of the integers.  This is Prop. 1.4
of Expose V.  The Springer-Verlag version corrects the mistake by proving
the result only when the topos has enough points (Prop 1.11 Exp. V).
Johnstone 1977 recovers the theorem for the case of a presheaf topos
(Lemma 8.2)  which is the case of interest and easily extends to any topos
with enough points.

Is that version optimal, in some easy to prove sense?  Is there an easy
example of a ring in a Grothendieck topos where the resolution
fails?           Is it known to be optimal in any sense?

best, Colin

Is the full subcategory of finite objects in the stable category
equivalent, as a triangulated category, to a full subcategory of the
derived category of an abelian category?  Can the abelian category be
chosen to be symmetric monoidal and so that S^0 corresponds to a
resolution of the unit object?

I am looking for any kind of result concerning the following question.

Consider a space X and an element x \in H^*(X;Z_2).
Take M(X,K;x) path component of x in the space of maps
M(X,K) where K is a suitable generalized
Eilenberg-MacLane space.

Question:
Is the evaluation map ev : M(X,K;x) \times X \rightarrow K
either a fibration or a cofibration?
What about it when X is a Thom space, x its thom class and K = K(Z_2,n)?

Thank you for your help.

Yours faithfully

Deligne's proof that inverse image functors preserve flat modules is to
internalize the Govorov-Lazard proof that a module is flat iff it is a
projective colimit of finite free modules, and to show inverse image
functors preserve these internalized colimits (SGA 4, Springer-Verlag
edition, Exp. V appendix).

The classical proof (say, Eisenbud COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA appendix 6, theorem
A6.6) looks good for topos logic though I admit I have not worked through
internalizing it.  Also, I have still not fought through the definitions in
Deligne's appendix to SGA 4.  I would still appreciate any reference to a
cleaner treatment if anyone knows one.  It seems likely that Deligne's
"local inductive limits" are internal colimits in the modern sense but I
have not read the thing closely enough yet to really say that.

This seems to me a strikingly sophisticated lifting of a theorem, from SET
to any topos, for 1972.  The current methods for routine lifting were just
being created over here in elementary topos theory at that time.  I believe
Deligne did not know of that.  Or am I making too much of this proof?  I'd
appreciate any historical reflections on relations between such lifting in
the Grothendieck school, and methods of elementary topos theory.

Dear category theorists,

My book "Call-By-Push-Value" has been published by Kluwer in the "Semantic
Structures in Computation" bookseries

http://www.wkap.nl/prod/b/1-4020-1730-8

- and I hope it will be of interest to many people on this list.
Although it is based on my PhD thesis, subsequent research has led to a
great deal of simplification.  In particular, the categorical structure of
the programming language - an adjunction between values and stacks - is
now completely apparent.

Here's the blurb:

Call-By-Push-Value
A Functional/Imperative Synthesis

"Call-by-push-value is a programming language paradigm that, surprisingly,
breaks down the call-by-value and call-by-name paradigms into simple
primitives. This monograph, written for graduate students and researchers,
exposes the call-by-push-value structure underlying a remarkable range of
semantics, including operational semantics, domains, possible worlds,
continuations and games.

"After introducing basic ideas using domain semantics and a stack machine,
the book is layered to appeal to readers in a variety of fields. One
strand treats semantics of store, culminating in a possible world model
for general storage cells. Another "implements" call-by-push-value by
translating it into the Jump-With-Argument continuation language, enabling
an account of pointer game semantics that explains its arenas, pointers
and question/answer labelling in concrete computational terms. Yet another
gives a categorical picture of call-by-push-value: an adjunction between
values and stacks.

"Incorporating recent simplifications, this is a key text for anyone
interested in lambda-calculus, programming language foundations or
applications of category theory."

Please feel free to email me, either about the book or about the subject!

Regards
Paul

The purpose of the CTCS conference series is the advancement of the
foundations of computing using the tools of category theory.  Previous
meetings have been held in Guildford (Surrey), Edinburgh (twice),
Manchester, Paris, Amsterdam, Cambridge, S. Margherita Ligure
(Genova), and Ottawa.

The emphasis is upon applications of category theory, but it is
recognized that the area is highly interdisciplinary. Typical topics
of interest include, but are not limited to, category-theoretic
aspects of the following:

* Coalgebras and computing
* Concurrent and distributed systems
* Constructive mathematics
* Declarative programming and term rewriting
* Domain theory and topology
* Foundations of computer security
* Linear logic
* Modal and temporal logics
* Models of computation
* Program logics, data refinement, and specification
* Programming language semantics
* Type theory

The proceedings of the conference will be published as a special issue
of ENTCS (Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science).

CTCS'02 in Ottawa, the CTCS of this year will have a graduate student
summer school from August 9-11, sponsored by the FIRST graduate school
(www.first.dk).  The goal is to prepare students (with basic knowledge
of category theory) for CTCS, through mini-courses in the basic areas
underlying some of the fields of the conference. The school will offer
the following mini-courses (5 lectures each):

    * Coalgebras, Modal Logic and Stone Duality (Lecturer: Alexander Kurz)
    * Game Semantics (Lecturer: Guy McCusker)
    * Operational Semantics (Lecturer: Pawel Sobocinski)
    * Categorical Models for Concurrency (Lecturer: Thomas Hildebrandt)

Registration Deadline: July 1st.


CMCIM WORKSHOP, August 11.

In between the summer school and the CTCS conference, August 11th,
there will be a half-day workshop on Categorical Methods in
Concurrency, Interaction and Mobility. The workshop has previously
been held in connection with CONCUR 2002 and CONCUR 2003.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts (less than 5 pages),
presenting recent results, challenges or work in progress. There will
be no formal proceedings of the workshop, informal proceedings will be
distributed at the workshop. Thus, accepted material may be published
elsewhere at a later date.

Workshop participation is *free*, but requires registration.

Registration is done by sending an email to hilde@itu.dk, containing
`CMCIM2004-registration' in the subject, and your full name and
institution in the body.

Submissions should be sent as PostScript files to: hilde@itu.dk,
containing `CMCIM-submission' in the subject, and in the body the full
names of the author(s), title, and a text-only abstract.

Workshop Organizers:

  Thomas Hildebrandt
  Alexander Kurz


CMCIM Workshop Registration Deadline: July 1st.
CMCIM Workshop Submission Deadline: June 21th.

Dear colleagues,

relative to what I sent last month, the following announcement has
been updated in three places, marked "*** NEW ***" below. Best wishes,
-- Peter


            SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

     2nd International Workshop on Quantum Programming Languages
                  (QPL2004)

           July 12-13, 2004, Turku, Finland
              Affiliated with LICS 2004

     http://quasar.mathstat.uottawa.ca/~selinger/qpl2004/

                * * *

  The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working
  on mathematical formalisms and programming languages for quantum
  computing. In the last few years, there has been a growing interest
  in logical tools, languages, and semantical methods for analyzing
  quantum computation. These foundational approaches complement the
  more mainstream research in quantum computation which emphasizes
  algorithms and complexity theory.

  Possible topics include the syntax and semantics of quantum
  programming languages, new paradigms for quantum programming,
  specification of quantum algorithms, higher-order quantum
  computation, quantum data types, reversible computation, axiomatic
  approaches to quantum computation, concurrent and distributed
  quantum computation, compilation of quantum programs, semantical
  methods in quantum information theory, and categorical models for
  quantum computation.

  The first workshop in this series was held June 15-16, 2003, in
  Ottawa, Canada.

INVITED SPEAKER: *** NEW ***

  Richard Jozsa (Bristol)

PROGRAM COMMITTEE: *** NEW ***

  Samson Abramsky (Oxford)
  Prakash Panangaden (McGill)
  Peter Selinger (Ottawa)

  talk should submit a one-page abstract (or a full paper up to 12
  pages, if available) by April 25 to selinger@mathstat.uottawa.ca
  (please put "workshop submission" in the subject line).  Authors of
  accepted abstracts or papers will be encouraged to submit a full
  version (subject to a page limit, details to be announced) for
  inclusion in the informal workshop proceedings (to be distributed at
  the workshop) by June 7. There will also be a special issue of the
  journal MSCS devoted to the workshop, see below.

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS ISSUE OF MSCS: *** NEW ***

            Announcement and Call for Abstracts


                        DOMAINS VII

             Darmstadt, August 29 - September 1


The WORKSHOP DOMAINS series is aimed at computer scientists and
mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
foundations of computation. It focusses on domains, their applications
and related topics.

The series was conceived and first realised by Klaus Keimel in
Darmstadt in 1994. This seventh workshop returns to Darmstadt on
the occasion of his 65th birthday.


The following have declared their intention to participate:

P.-L. Curien  Univerity Paris 7
Yu.L. Ershov  Sib. Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, Novosibirsk
J.D. Lawson   Louisiana State University
M. Mislove    Tulane University
J.-E. Pin     University Paris 7
D.S. Scott    Carnegie Mellon University

SCOPE

Domain Theory has had applications to programming language semantics
and logics (lambda calculus, PCF, LCF), recursion theory, general
topology, topological algebra and analysis.

As such Domain Theory is highly interdisciplinary. Part of the
workshop will be devoted to the study of Continuous Phenomena in
Computer Science, one of the themes of the APPLIED SEMANTICS II
Network. Topics of interaction with Domain Theory for this workshop
include, but are not limited to

  computation over the reals and other classical spaces
  probabilistic computation
  topology / locale theory
  constructive mathematics and its semantics
  computability theory
  program semantics
  program logics
  lambda calculus
  models of sequential computation


LOCATION

The Workshop will take place at Technische Universitaet Darmstadt
located in the center of the city of Darmstadt.


WORKSHOP SCHEDULE

August 29 is the arrival day. There will be a barbecue in the
afternoon or a dinner in the evening. The talks will take place from
9 a.m on Monday, August 30, until 5 p.m. on Wednesday, September 1.


PARTICIPATION

If you would like to participate in this workshop as we hope, please
let us know:

     email:  domains7@mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de

Please indicate whether you would like to give a talk.


SUBMISSION of ABSTRACTS

One page abstracts should be submitted to

         domains7@mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de

Shortly after an abstract is submitted (usually one or two weeks), the authors
will be notified by the programme committee. Abstracts will be dealt with on
a first come/first served basis.

Submit as soon as possible, DEADLINE   30 June 2004


ACCOMODATION

Hello,

    This question is a little bit afield; however, it is still tied in
with intuitionistic logic. On my Linux machine, I have a screensaver that
is a three-dimensional of a Cantor set. A Cantor set has prescription or
algorithm as to how we "calculate" or build it. Question: From a
constructivist viewpoint though, can we ever realize the actual object
which is infinite?

Regards, Bill Halchin

The question is: "From a constructivist viewpoint though, can we ever
realize the actual object which is infinite?"

Unless you specialize to decidable objects (excluded middle for
equality) then there is no easy way to _avoid_ infinite objects.

One may get a hint of this from the following example: in the category
of  N-sets (sets with a distinguished self-map) let  A  be the
two-element set in which the distinguished self-map has a unique
fixed point. In Cats and Allegories (1.925) we point out that  A^A,
the object of self-maps of  A, falls apart as a coproduct (disjoint
union) of continuously many  N-sets. Hence if one takes the set of
equivalence classes of  A^A, where the equivalence relation is the
double-negation of equality, one obtains a discrete set (it has
trivial N-action) whose cardinality is the continuum.

But that's just a hint.

Consider the following theorem for topoi. Let  T  be the initial
object in the category of topoi and logical morphisms. _No axiom of
infinity._ Let  1  be the terminator in  T.  Let  Omega  be its power
object. Let  P  be  Omega^Omega, the object of self-maps on  Omega.
There's a subobject, M, of  P  on which we may define the structure of
a rig (a ring without negation) that mimics the natural numbers. In
particular the set of global sections, that is, maps from  1  to  M
with its inherited rig structure, is isomorphic to the standard natural
numbers.

Because the global sections can be misleading in an arbitrary topos
it's worth pointing out that  M  mimics the natural numbers even from
an internal point of view. For instance given any pair of polynomials,
f(x_1,...,x_n), g(x_1,...,x_n)  with natural-number coefficients the
the first-order sentence

  \exists_{x_1,...,x_n\in M}   f(x_1,...,x_n) = g(x_1,...,x_n)

is satisfied in  T  iff it is satisfied in the standard natural
numbers.

An elaboration of this argument allows us to construct a topos-object
in  T  whose topos of global sections is isomorphic to the free topos
with natural-numbers-object. And, as for  M, an equation in the theory
of topoi is internally true for this internal topos iff it is true for
the free topos with NNO.

Lest one think I'm butting up against the consistency proof, the truth
value in  T  of  0 = 1  in  M  is not totally false. (That is, M  is
"somewhat inconsistent" from the internal point of view.) From the
external point of view, though, the two maps from the terminator to  M
that name  0  and  1  are not equal (from the internal point of view
their equalizer is non-trivial). In particular we can find  f,g  so
that the first-order sentence above has no standard solutions but is
not totally false in  T.

The slogan: once you've given up excluded middle there's no gain in
giving up the axiom of infinity.

Recently I was asking myself what is the relation between the arithmetical
(Dedekind) reals in a topos and a ring R satisfying the usual SDG axioms
(i.e. at least the Kock-Lawvere) axiom.

>From the few things I know about models of SDG it seems to me as if in the
usual sheaf models (over a site Loc of `loci') the Dedekind reals form a
subring of R = y(\Re) (where \Re is the locus corresponding to the reals).
As long as one considers just presheaves that's clear as the Dedekind reals
are given by \Delta(\Re).
Probably taking sheaves that situation isn't changed dramatically?

So my impression is that in the usual sheaf models of SDG the real line R
carries the structure of an algebra over the Dedekind reals. However, I don't
see how to construct such an embedding of Dedekind reals into R based only
on the usual axioms of SDG. Of course, when given an order on R and R is
assumed as a Q-algebra then one has a good candidate for a function from R
to R_D sending x \in R to {q \in Q | q.1 \leq x}. But how to define purely
logically an embedding of R_D into R remains mysterious (to me).

I am fully aware of the fact that my question is a bit `against the strain'
of SDG but we know that both kinds of reals do coexist in topos models.
But is this coexistence only peaceful or rather more collaborative?

I am certain that people must have thought about this but I couldn't find
anything at the usual places where to look. So I would be grateful for
comments (on the correctness of my above speculations) or pointers to
existing literature or folklore.

Best, Thomas Streicher

I wrote:

  [I]n the category  of  N-sets (sets with a distinguished self-map)
  let  A  be the two-element set in which the distinguished self-map
  has a unique fixed point....A^A, the object of self-maps of  A,
  falls apart as a coproduct (disjoint union) of continuously many
  N-sets. Hence if one takes the set of equivalence classes of  A^A,
  where the equivalence relation is the double-negation of equality,
  one obtains a discrete set (it has trivial N-action) whose
  cardinality is the continuum.

It's more complicated. One obtains a disjoint union of "cycles", that
is, objects of the form  Z/nZ  where the distinguished self-map is
addition by  1. For each  n > 0  there are only a finite number of
copies of  Z/nZ. The number of copies of  Z = Z/0Z  is uncountable.

Postscript:

The sequence of numbers of copies of each finite cycle is, of course,
guaranteed to be in Neil Sloan's "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer
Sequences", but we didn't have that. Instead in 1.925 of Cats &
Alligators we gave a ridiculous -- but both correct and unimprovable
-- formula for that finite number. Preceding it was a sentence that
begins "Bearing in mind that, as far as we know, this is computation
for its own sake". Anyway, you can find the same formula at

      mathworld.wolfram.com/IrreduciblePolynomial.html

under the name  L_q(n)  (with  q = 2).

With the exception of the zero'th value (in our case it's
2^{\Aleph_0}, for Lyndon words it's 1) here's what Sloan has to say:

-------------------------------------------------

CONCUR 2004, the 15th International Conference on Concurrency Theory,
takes place at the Royal Society, London, Tuesday 31 August - Friday 3
September 2004. As well as the main event, we will also hold many
workshops on Monday 30th August and Saturday 4th February, as detailed
below.  Further information is available at the conference's web site

                  http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/concur2004

Important dates
      Submission: Friday 9 April 2004
      Notification: Monday 31 May 2004
      Final version: Tuesday 15 June 2004

The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers and students in order to advance the theory of
concurrency, and promote its applications. Interest in this topic is
continuously growing, as a consequence of the importance and ubiquity
of concurrent systems and their applications, and of the scientific
relevance of their foundations.

Submissions are solicited in all areas of semantics, logics and
verification techniques for concurrent systems. Principal topics
include (but are not limited to): - Basic models and logics of
concurrent and distributed computation (such as process algebras,
Petri nets, domain theoretic or game theoretic models, modal and
temporal logics).  - Specialized or enriched models (such as circuits,
synchronous systems, real time and hybrid systems, stochastic systems,
data bases, mobile and migrating systems, parametric protocols,
security protocols).  - Related verification techniques and tools
(such as state-space exploration, model-checking, synthesis,
abstraction, automated deduction, testing).  - Related programming
models (such as distributed, constraints or object oriented, graph
rewriting, as well as associated type systems, static analyses,
abstract machines, and environments).

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract not exceeding 15
pages electronically via the web submission form at the conference's
web site.  Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee
for inclusion in the proceedings, which will be published by
Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
series. Papers must contain original contributions, be clearly
written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison with
related work.  Simultaneous submissions to other conferences are not
allowed.

There will be a special issue of the journal Theoretical Computer
Science associated with Concur 2004.

Let  *T*  be the topos freely generated by its constants (a few
postings ago I called it the initial object in the category of topoi
and logical morphisms), let  Omega  be its subobject classifier and
let  P  denote  Omega^Omega. I wrote:

  There's a subobject, M, of  P  on which we may define the structure
  of a rig (a ring without negation) that mimics the natural numbers.
  In particular the set of global sections, that is, maps from  1  to
  M  with its inherited rig structure, is isomorphic to the standard
  natural numbers...

  [Moreover we may] construct a topos-object in  *T*  whose topos of
  global sections is isomorphic to the free topos with NNO. And, as
  for  M, an equation in the theory of topoi is internally true for
  this internal topos iff it is true for the free topos with NNO.

It occurs to me that the proofs I have in mind rest on at least three
considerations that may not be well known. (I have no idea about other
proofs.)

The first consideration stems from curiosity about the complete
algebraic theory of  Omega. In particular, what are its unary
operators? Some would phrase that: What are the "modalities" implicit
in higher-order intuitionistic logic?

There's a particular operator that keeps popping up for me.

In an arbitrary heyting algebra define  x << y  to mean that not only
is  x  less than or equal to  y, but the value of  y -> x  is as small
as it can be, that is, y -> x = x. In a complete heyting algebra
define an order-preserving, inflationary unary operation  s  by

                       sx =  inf{ y | x << y }.

E.g.: on a linearly ordered set if { y | x < y } has a least element
then that's what  sx  is. If there is no smallest element above  x,
then  sx = x (even without the completeness hypothesis). In
particular, note, there no assertion that  x << sx.

The subobject classifier in an elementary topos is complete in the
relevant sense: s  is definable. A quick description of the
construction to follow is that we're going to turn  s  into the
successor operation on an NNO.

DIVERSION: The definition I just gave is the first I came across. The
next incarnation for me was when I wanted a measure of the failure of
booleaness. In any topos, *A*, there's a largest subterminator  B
with the property that the slice category  *A*/B  is boolean. But
given any subterminator, U, we have its "closed sheaves", *A*_(U), the
full subcat of objects  A  such that  AxU --> U  is an iso. (This is a
subcategory of sheaves for a Lawvere-Tierney topology. Starting with
a space  X  then  Sheaves(X)_(U)  may be identified with  Sheaves(U'),
where  U'  denotes the complement of U.)  Note that the lattice of
subterminators in  *A*_(U)  is isomorphic to the interval of
subterminators in  *A*  from  U  up. We can define BU  to be the
largest subterminator in  *A*_(U)  such that  *A*_(U)/BU  is boolean.
The interval of subterminators in  *A*  from  U  up to  BU  is boolean
and in the relevant internal sense, BU  is the largest such
subterminator. We can, of course, translate this all to a unary
operation on  Omega.

It's the same operator  s.

When one specializes this to a space  X  it becomes historically
familiar if we dualize it it to a deflationary operator on closed
subsets. It's the operation that removes isolated points. The very
operation that got Cantor started. Hence the word "historically".

END OF DIVERSION

Back to  *T*: in the monoid  Omega^Omega  define  C  to be the
submonoid generated by  s. We're going to use  0 : 1 --> C  to denote
the name of the identity element (you might think of it as  s^0) and
we're going to use  suc : C -> C  to denote the function that sends an
element  x  to  sx.

It's easy to verify that the necessary and sufficient condition for
C,0,suc  to be an NNO is that -- in the internal sense -- it has no
fixed points. The argument works for any one-generator partially-
ordered monoid whose identity element is below the generator. Let  E
be the equalizer of  1, suc : C --> C. I'm saying that  C,0,suc  is an
NNO iff  E  is empty.

Let  V  be the negation of the image of  E --> 1. It is the largest
subterminator such that  C,0,suc  becomes an NNO in the slice category
*T*/V.

Now for the nice part. The sconing argument tells us that  V, as is
the case for any non-trivial negation, is an indecomposable projective
-- that is, the covariant functor represented by  V  is an exact
functor. And that means that  1  is an indecomposable projective in
the slice category  *T*/V. The "global-section" functor from  *T*/V
to  *Sets*  is exact. Hence (by my first theorem in this subject) it
preserves the NNO and all the definable structure thereon.

I advertised an object, not in a slice category but in  *T*. So define
M = C^V. Then it is easily verified that the global sections of  M
as defined in  *T*  are naturally isomorphic to the global sections
of  C/V  as defined in  *T*/V.

Since it has an NNO we can construct all sorts of things in  *T*/V.
We'll settle here for the free-topos-object-with-NNO. That is, there
is an object  T  in  *T*/V  with a binary partial operation that
serves as the free topos with NNO in  *T*/V. Since the global-section
functor is exact we know that it preserves free structures in great
generality (part of lore of exact functors between topoi). In
particular it carries  T  to a standard free topos with NNO .And,
finally, we know that  T^V  has that same last property as an object
in  *T*.

(Better, actually, is to take  T  to be the free topos on one object.
Every finitely presented topos is a slice thereof -- including the
free-topos-with-NNO.)

Surely this is all too easy. Yeah. I skipped over something. My point
about negations being indecomposable projectives requires them to be
non-trivial. (The covariant functor represented by  0  is not exact;
it does not preserve the coterminator.) That is, we need to show that
V  is not  0. But for that it suffices (given the defining universal
property for  *T*) to show in at least one topos that the recipe for
V  yields something nontrivial. Equivalently, we need a topos in which
V = 1. The most easily named example is the topos of  N-sets, or as I
described it a few postings ago, the topos of sets with distinguished
self-maps. This topos is two-valued, that is, Sub(1)  has just two
elements and that can be an advantage. (We know that we must show that
suc : C --> C  has no fixed points.) In fact, I find it easier to work
in the slice category  (*Sets*^N)/N. (There is, anyway, a faithful
representation of  *Sets*^N  into  (*Sets*^N)/N.) The category
(*Sets*^N)/N  is equivalent to the category of covariant set-valued
functors on the poset also denoted  N. The advantage here is just the
opposite: (*Sets*^N)/N  is generated by its non-zero subterminators
and they're all indecomposable projectives.

DIVERSION: When I first finished writing this piece I noticed for the
first time that there's a historically much better example. Take the
category of sheaves on the reals (or for that matter, any space of
geometric interest). Then follow in Cantor's footsteps.

FOOTNOTE:

One variation worth mentioning. Instead of taking  C  as the submonoid
generated by  s  take it to be the smallest up-closed submonoid, that
is, this new version of  C  will be closed with respect to sups. This
C  is trying to be a big ordinal number. Indeed, following just the
path first taken by Cantor we can find Grothendieck topoi where  C
looks like an arbitrarily large initial section of ordinals.

In the free topos with NNO this  C  seems to be none other than the
ordinal (in some relevant sense) of all recursively enumerable
ordinals.
