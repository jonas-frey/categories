             The LINEAR International Summer School

                 (Linear Logic and Applications)

                 August 30 to September 7, 2000

        Hotel Terra Nostra, S.Miguel, Azores, Portugal


The Linear TMR research network (http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/LINEAR) is
proud to announce its first International Summer School on Linear
Logic and Applications.

The school is directed to everyone doing postgraduate work in
Computer Science or Mathematics with an interest in the field
of Formal Logic and its applications.

The school lasts one week and comprises both lectures and
thematic sessions. The lectures are in the tradition of summer
schools and cover one topic, from basic material to more advanced
issues. The topics and lecturers are the following:

      Samson Abramsky --- Game Semantics
      Jean-Yves Girard -- Linear Logic and Ludics
      Stefano Guerrini -- Proof-Nets and Lambda-Calculus
      Yves Lafont ------- Phase Semantics and Decision Problems
      Phil Scott -------- Category Theory and Concrete Models

The thematic sessions will cover state-of-the-art research in Linear
Logic. Each session has an organiser responsible for inviting speakers
who will talk about their work. The themes and organisers are the
following:

      Andrea Asperti ---- Applications
      Vincent Danos ----- Proof Theory
      Thomas Ehrhard ---- Semantics
      Glynn Winskel ----- Concurrency

The school will be held in the island of S.Miguel, Azores, amid
luxurious vegetation and hot water springs. The entrance to the mythic
kingdom of the Atlantis is believed to be located near Hotel Terra
Nostra, some say at the bottom of its famous red and hot water swimming
pool...

Detailed information and application forms are available at

      http://linear.di.fc.ul.pt

Foundational Methods in Computer Science


JUNE 1st - 4th, 2000


The Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia, in
cooperation with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is
hosting the Foundational Methods in Computer Science workshop from
June 1 to June 4, 2000, on the University of British Columbia Campus
in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.

The workshop is an informal meeting to bring together researchers in
mathematics and computer science with a focus on the applications of
category theory in computer science.

The reception in the evening of June 1, 2000, at Walter Gage Towers, is
followed by a day of tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to category
theory, followed by a day and a half of research talks. There will be a
few invited presentations, but the majority of the talks are solicited
from the participants. Student participation is particularly encouraged
at FMCS.

Bonjour,



In Kapranov & Voevodsky, "Combinatorial-geometric aspects of 
polycategory theory : pasting scheme and higher bruhat orders", 
Cahiers de topologie et géométrie différentielle catégoriques, 
Vol XXXII-1 (1991), the authors discuss the problem of the
existence of the "derived pasting scheme" of a composable pasting
scheme.

I would like to know please what have been done on this subject
since 1991 ?

    Last Fall I asked the Algebraic Topology and Category mailing lists
what was known about model category structures on Cat, the category of
small categories. For those who are interested, what follows is a
summary of what I found. It is, I'm sure, incomplete, and I apologize to
anyone whose work I have slighted or missed entirely.

    The interest and the problem stem from the observation that the
nerve functor N induces an equivalence between Cat and the category of
simplicial sets, after inverting weak equivalences. The weak
equivalences in Cat are, by definition, those maps that become weak
equivalences on applying N. This result can be found in the following
two sources (but goes back further, to at least Gabriel & Zisman):

Thomason, Homotopy colimits in Cat, with applications to algebraic
K-theory and loop space theory, Dissertation, Princeton, 1977.

Latch, The uniqueness of homology for the category of small categories,
J. Pure Appl. Algebra 9, 221-237 (1977).

    Unfortunately, the left adjoint for N, which is the "categorical
realization" functor c, does not give the inverse equivalence. Although
the counit cN -> 1 is an isomorphism, the unit 1 -> Nc is far from being
a weak equivalence. A related problem is that, if C is a small category,
then NC is fibrant iff C is a groupoid. This raises the question: Is
there an adjoint pair of functors (L,R): SimpSet -> Cat and a model
category structure on Cat with the weak equivalences as above, such that
(L,R) induces an adjoint pair of equivalences between the Quillen
homotopy categories (i.e., (L,R) is a Quillen equivalence)?
    Thomason gave an affirmative answer in

Thomason, Cat as a closed model category, Cahiers Topologie Geom.
Differentielle Categoriques XXI, 305-324 (1980).

    This followed an attempt by Golasinski in a 1978 preprint which
appeared in print as

Golasinksi, Homotopies of small categories, Fund. Math. CXIV, 209-217
(1981).

    Golasinski's proposed structure failed to satisfy the factorization
axiom, but does lead to a closed model category on the category of
pro-objects in Cat, as shown in

Golasinski, On closed models on the precategory of small categories and
simplicial schemes, Uspekhi Mat. Nauk 39, 239--240 (1984) (Russian,
translated in Russian Math. Surveys 39, 275-276 (1984)).

    More recently, Heggie defined a class of cofibrations in Cat, in

Heggie, Homotopy cofibrations in CAT, Cahiers Topologie Geom.
Differentielle Categoriques XXXIII, 291-313 (1992).

I haven't had time to compare them, but at first glance these
cofibrations appear closely related to Thomason's, if not identical. I
also recommend two other papers by Heggie:

Heggie, The left derived tensor product of CAT-valued diagrams, Cahiers
Topologie Geom. Differentielle Categoriques XXXIII, 33-53 (1992).

Heggie, Homotopy colimits in presheaf categories, Cahiers Topologie
Geom. Differentielle Categoriques XXXIV, 13-36 (1993).

    The upshot of all this is that Thomason's is still the only model
category structure known (or, at least, published) on Cat making it
equivalent to the category of simplicial sets.
    Besides an aesthetic objection to Thomason's model category
structure, I have a practical one: Thomason uses the second subdivision
followed by categorical realization as the functor going from simplicial
sets to small categories inducing the equivalence of homotopy
categories. This functor does not preserve products, as does categorical
realization by itself. For various reasons it would be really nice to
have a functor that does preserve products and is the left adjoint in a
Quillen equivalence. I throw this out as a problem I'd like to work on
myself, when I get time. If anyone has any thoughts about it, I'd be
happy to hear them.

    There were other references I came across, answering related but
different questions. For example, there is a short, unpublished 1996
manuscript by Charles Rezk giving a very nice model structure on Cat in
which the weak equivalences are the equivalences of categories (this was
probably folklore for quite a while). There has also been quite a lot of
work on model category structures for n-categories and related gadgets;
however, when restricted to ordinary categories this work generally
gives the homotopy equivalence between the category of simplicial
1-types and the category of small groupoids.

Dear All,

Next September I am organising a small workshop at Bangor on Orbifolds,
Groupoids and their Applications. I include an announcement giving some
more details.  We hope to provide an oportunity to bridge the gap between
the categorical(mostly topos theoretic and sheaf theoretic) aspects and
the applications (including crystallographic topology, geoemtric group
theory etc.).

Best wishes,

Tim

                                Workshop on
                   Orbifolds, Groupoids, and their Applications




                                Announcement

                     Workshop Organiser : Prof Tim Porter

There will be an informal open workshop at the University of Wales Bangor f=
rom
11th - 17th September, 2000, on the interplay between orbifolds and groupoi=
ds,
together with the application of orbifold methods to problems in
crystallography, geometric group theory and equivariant algebraic
topology. The aim of the Workshop is to provide a venue for the exchange of
information on different aspects of the area and to encourage collaboration
across the different subject specialisms that are involved. Some time will =
be
set aside for examination of the problems where existing techniques seem no=
t to be adequate.=20

The workshop is in part to celebrate the work on groupoids, their theory an=
d
applications, by Ronnie Brown who has recently retired from a full time pro=
fessorship a
t Bangor. It will also form part of his (belated) 65 birthday celebrations!=
=20

The workshop will be informal. Although there will be some survey talks, it=
 is
hoped that the main work will be concentrated on the future in `discussion
mode' rather than lecture, (so participants are encouraged to interrupt!!!)=
 We
hope that questions such as to the interpretation of homotopy theoretic
information on orbifold, the applicability of current algebraic - topologic=
al
techniques to problems in `crystallographic topology' and the link between
orbifolds and sheaf theory will be addressed. The background of the
participants is from various subject areas (crystallography, geometric grou=
p theory,=20
category theory etc.) and one task is to find a common language where
everyone has a moderate chance of understanding and communicating their
questions. There may be some need for quick sketches of background
assumptions, theory etc and because of this sessions are likely to be of
variable length and the timetable will be (by necessity) flexible.=20

At present the list of participants includes:=20

      R.Brown (Groupoids and their applications)=20
      A. Haefliger (Geometric group theory, groupoids and geometry)=20
      C. Johnson (Crystallographic Topology)=20
      I. Moerdijk (Category Theory, orbifolds and toposes)=20
      D. Pronk (Sheaves on orbifolds)=20

Various U.K. researchers in differentiable groupoids, equivariant homotopy =
and its a
pplications and related areas are also expected.=20

Additional participants are very welcome.=20

Accommodation is likely to be in the student village (en-suite facilities) =
at a short=20
distance (5 to 10 minutes walk) from the Mathematics building. (Further
information about accommodation in and abound Bangor is available.)=20

A small registration fee of =A320 is requested to cover the cost of a works=
hop dinner a
nd daily coffee/tea etc. We will be seeking some financial support from
various organisations so may be able to give limited help to some participa=
nts
(priority would be given to postgraduates).=20

There will be some space for a display of preprints/ offprints and `posters=
'.=20

If you are interested in attending the workshop, contact me by e-mail: t.po=
rter@bangor.ac.uk=20
in the first instance. For further information check the workshop home page=

        CATS 2001  -  Computing: The Australasian Theory Symposium

                        
Computing: The Australasian Theory Symposium (CATS) is the premier
theoretical computer science conference in Australasia.  It is held
annually as part of Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW).  CATS
2001 will be the seventh in the series.  The symposium will consist of
invited speakers and research paper presentations.


DATE AND LOCATION

CATS 2001 will be held over two days during Australasian Computer
Science Week.  ACSW 2001 will take place at Bond University, Gold
Coast, Queensland, Australia, from 29th January to 2nd February 2001.


SCOPE

CATS covers all aspects of theoretical computer science.  Some
representative, but not exclusive, topics include the following:
- logic, reasoning and verification
- formal specification techniques and program semantics
- formal development methods, program refinement, synthesis and
  transformation
- concurrent, parallel and distributed system theory
- theory of algorithms and data structures
- complexity and computability
- automata, number and category theory
- tools for automated reasoning, and program analysis and development


KEYNOTE ADDRESSES

Prof Mathai Joseph, Tata Research Development and Design Centre, Pune,
  India
Prof Carroll Morgan, Software Engineering Research Group, Department of
  Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales


CALL FOR PAPERS

Research paper submissions to CATS 2001 should be prepared according
to the formatting requirements below and sent to the Programme Chair,
to arrive no later than August 4, 2000.  Submissions must be original
work, not published or submitted elsewhere.  All submissions will be
refereed.


PROCEEDINGS

The proceedings of CATS 2001 will be published by Elsevier Science in
their series Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.  ENTCS
is an electronic series associated with the journal Theoretical
Computer Science, and published by Elsevier Science B. V.
(Institutions subscribing to TCS can access full papers in ENTCS
on-line.)  ENTCS offers rapid, worldwide dissemination of research
results, an absence of page limits, and long-term accessibility
through the electronic archives that Elsevier maintains.  (The
proceedings of last year's CATS 2000 conference appeared as ENTCS
Volume 31.)  A hardcopy preliminary proceedings will be provided to
conference attendees.

Authors of selected papers from the CATS 2001 proceedings will be
invited to submit extended versions of their papers to a Special Issue
of the journal Theoretical Computer Science.


FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

To ensure a uniform format for papers, all submissions to CATS 2001
must be prepared in LaTeX using the ENTCS macros.  Papers in other
formats cannot be accepted.  Further information is available via the
ENTCS home page: http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs/.  (Follow the
links for "Instructions for Submissions" and "Technical
Requirements".)  Complete papers should be e-mailed as PostScript
files, preferably as MIME attachments.

Although there is no strict page limit on submissions to CATS 2001,
authors are strongly encouraged to be as concise as possible.  Papers
between 10 and 15 pages are considered ideal.  If necessary,
definitions and proofs not essential to understanding the paper should
be relegated to appendices to appear only in the electronic version.


CALL FOR POSTERS

A poster session will be arranged to give CATS attendees the
opportunity to give informal presentations of their work.  Expressions
of interest, briefly outlining the poster's topic, should be e-mailed
to the Programme Chair by November 10, 2000.


IMPORTANT DATES

Friday 4 August 2000: Deadline for submissions
Friday 6 October 2000: Notification of acceptance
Friday 27 October 2000: Final versions of accepted papers due
Friday 10 November 2000: Deadline for author registrations

I have a CTCS99 paper ``On the semantics of message passing processes'' at
http://theory.doc.ic.ac.uk/~le which may be relevant. As the title
suggests, it looks at categorical semantics for a CSP-like language with
assignment. It is related to the work mentioned by Robin and Dusko. Also,
the conclusions of my thesis discusses representing process networks as
diagrams in a category of processes. This might be related to your comment
above.

                           FORMAL METHODS EUROPE

                                   FME 2001
            "Formal Methods for Increasing Software Productivity"

                   International Symposium and Tutorials

                           12-16 March 2001
                 Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, Germany

              (http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/top/fme2001)


                           Call for Submissions
                           ********************

FME 2001 is the tenth in a series of symposia organised by Formal Methods
Europe, an independent association whose aim is to stimulate the use of,
and research on, formal methods for software development.  These symposia
have been notably successful in bringing together a community of users,
researchers, and developers of precise mathematical methods for software
development.

The theme of FME 2001 is Formal Methods for Increasing Software Productivity.
This theme recognizes that formal methods have the potential to do more for
industrial software development than enhance software quality--they can also
increase productivity at many different points in the software life-cycle.
The symposium committee is particularly interested in papers on the use of
formal methods to increase productivity, for example on:

 * Codifying domain knowledge
 * Re-using components
 * Automatically generating code and/or documentation
 * Improving the efficiency of software testing
 * Enhancing analysis techniques for validation and verification
 * Exploiting commonalities within product families
 * Improving the maintainability and modifiability of software
 * Empirical studies of effects on productivity

SCOPE

The scope of the symposium, as always in its distinguished history, also
includes all other aspects of the use of formal methods, for development
of software in all application areas.  The scope of the symposium covers
the entire range from fundamental theory of description and reasoning
to particulars of practice and experience.

In addition to presentations of submitted papers, the symposium will also
offer tutorials, workshops, invited speakers, and tool demonstrations.

PAPERS

The symposium committee solicits full-length papers in two broad categories:

1. Use of formal methods, including reports on industrial use, substantial
   case studies, comparisons among methods, education, and technology transfer.
2. Development of formal methods, including motivating factors, theoretical
   foundations, extensions, manual procedures, and tool support.

Authors are requested to mention the category (1 or 2) of their papers when
they submit.

Full papers should be submitted in Postscript or PDF format by E-mail to reach
fme2001sub@di.uminho.pt by 25th August, 2000.

There are no fixed page limits on submissions but authors are warned that
papers exceeding twenty A4 pages will be regarded as long, and that the
content must justify the length.

TUTORIALS

Tutorials will be held on 12-13th March.  Each tutorial will last one-half or
one day.  Proposals for tutorials are welcome, and should be directed to
the programme chairs.

WORKSHOPS

Proposals for parallel workshops are welcome, and should be directed to
the programme chairs.

TOOL DEMONSTRATIONS

Tool demonstrations will take place during the symposium, with the
opportunity for presentations to be made about each tool. Proposals for
tool demonstrations are welcome and should be made to the organising chairs,
with whom provision of necessary computing facilities should be discussed.

Dear Mathematicians

Our colleague Max Kelly turns 70 on 5 June 2000.  To commemorate this 
milestone, and in recognition of Max's significant contribution to 
mathematics (especially category theory), there will be a special 
volume of the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra dedicated him. The 
appropriateness of this Journal is clear as Max has been on the 
editorial board since its inception.

The Editors for this special volume will be Aurelio Carboni 
(representing the regular editorial board), George Janelidze and me 
(as guest editors).

We hereby call for submission of papers. We would like those of you 
have published with Max, worked with him, used his results, or simply 
respected his work, to consider contributing a research article.  The 
standards of the Journal will be upheld by the usual refereeing 
procedure.

	****The deadline for submission is 28 November 2000.****

Please send your article to one of the editors:

Is there a binary product in the category of sets and functions that is
"strictly associative", i.e.

A x (B x C) = (A x B) x C   and
the associativity isomorphisms are equal to the identity?

Thanks.

	I don't know who invented the "vertical bar-arrow" notation 
but I do have a pretty good idea of how and why it caught on, and it 
is related to the rise of category theory where the use of arrows 
proliferates and a real need arises for some notational distinction 
between using an arrow to denote a mapping X--->F(X) as, for example, 
the value at an object X of a natural transformation from the the 
identity functor to some endofunctor F and the correspondence 
X--->F(X) which defines the functor itself.
	In the early sixties, Grothendieck started using a "very 
wiggly arrow"  X~~~>F(X) to denote the correspondence (curiously, 
always drawn in by hand--not with repeated "~" on the typewriter) and 
this notation caught on, at least with those who studied with him at 
that time, and even survives today (e.g., in Mike Artin's recent and 
beautiful "undergraduate" text, Algebra). Moreover, in the early 
seventies, seeing those very noticeable wiggles in a book or paper 
immediately provoked attention ("What the hell is that?") and made 
the book or paper look "very up to date" (or,more derisively, "very 
trendy"). Undergraduate Calculus texts had already been using arrows 
(" x--->3x+5" instead of "y=3x+5" ) not only to try to  convey the 
idea of a mapping but also to look "very up to date". Being told that 
the "correct" notation for this was now "x~~~>3x+5", publishers were 
faced with the very expensive problem (in those days before Tex) of 
re-typesetting their heretofore trivially revised ("just mix up the 
exercise problem numbers and correct a few misprints") 5th and 6th 
editions with a 7th edition in which every every arrow "--->" would 
have to be replaced by " ~~~>" if the text were to remain "up to 
date".
  	Someone--I wish I knew whom-- had the authority and the 
temerity to suggest that " x|--> 3x+5" would be a less intrusive and 
certainly less expensive solution to both the logical and the 
economic problem. It caught on almost immediately and survives to 
this day. The "very wiggly arrow" would still be a pretty good 
notation to indicate a " lax" or pseudo-functor, but as far as I can 
see, it hasn't been adopted even for that purpose. It does survive 
(if somewhat diminutively) as "\leadsto" in the "arrow and pointers" 
math fonts of Tex.

suggest that " x|--> 3x+5" would be a less intrusive and certainly less
expensive solution to both the logical and the economic problem. It
caught on almost immediately and survives to this day. The "very wiggly
arrow" would still be a pretty good notation to indicate a " lax" or
pseudo-functor, but as far as I can see, it hasn't been adopted even
for that purpose. It does survive (if somewhat diminutively) as
"\leadsto" in the "arrow and pointers" math fonts of Tex.

Categorically speaking this question is undecidable.  The question has
different answers for equivalent copies of Set.

Isbell points out (reported in CTWM, end of VII-1) that if Set (or any
subcategory thereof containing a countably infinite set) is skeletal,
on-the-nose associativity is impossible.

Stacy Finkelstein in her thesis (or at least in a talk on Tau Categories
that I recall as being based on her thesis) gave a subcategory of Set
consisting of ordinals up to w^w and their (order-ignoring) functions
with an on-the-nose product.

In the course of the discussion following my question of 3/11/96 to this
list about the relative ease of defining set membership and composition
in terms of each other, I posted a similar construction (on 3/14/96) for
the whole of Set (more precisely, for a subcategory of Set consisting of
those sets that can be well-ordered, more precisely yet Ord(inals) and
their (order-ignoring) functions).  (I learned about Stacy's construction
shortly thereafter.)

These latter versions of Set are of course not skeletal by virtue of
distinct ordinals (w, w+1, etc.) being isomorphic, necessary by Isbell's
observation.

Whereas my set-membership question and its subsequent lengthy discussion
were I gather appreciated by many, the reactions to the on-the-nose
product I posted as part of it varied from indifference to outright
hostility.  On reflection these reactions, coming from category theorists,
are entirely consistent with the categorical undecidability of whether
Set admits on-the-nose product.

I think this is obvious from the fact that the theory of presheaves over C
is many sorted, essentially algebraic (a finite limit theory), with a sort
for each object of C and a unary operator for each morphism. Then finitely
presentable in the categorical sense is the same as finitely presentable in
the algebraic sense, which is equivalent to being a finite colimit of free
cyclic (i.e. one generator) algebras. In the case of presheaves, Yoneda's
lemma says precisely that the free algebra on a generator of sort X (object
of C) is the representable presheaf for X.

I have exploited some of these facts in a paper with my PhD student Gillian
Hill, "Presheaves as configured specifications". It develops a language for
specifying systems by components with sharing.

The answer is yes if you're willing to use a lot of choice. Perhaps 
the quickest construction is to assume a well-ordering on the universe
with the property that  x < y  whenever  x \in  y. Then define the
pair  l:AxB --> A, r:AxB --> B  by stipulating that  AxB  is a von
Neumann ordinal "lexicagraphically ordered" by  l  and  r, that is,

          (lx < ly)  or  (lx = ly  and  rx < ry)
whenever
          (x \in  y)  and  (y \in  AxB).

I gave a construction using the axiom of choice. Well, we can do
better. Fix on an ordered-pair construction, say Weiner's, and denote 
its values as  <x,y>. Let  l  be the left-coordinate function, r the
right-coordinate function. 

Fix on a sequence of finite ordinals, say von Neumann's. Define,
inductively, an n-TUPLE as something of the form  <x,y>  where  y  is
a (n-1)-tuple if  n>1  else any old set if  n=1. (There are no 
0-tuples.) Note that the same set can be an n-tuple for any number of
values for  n. But if  x  is an  n-tuple and we are given  n  then
each of it's  n  coordinates is well-defined:

        x_1 = lx
        x_2 = l(rx)
...
    x_{n-1} = l(r(r(...r(rx)...)))
        x_n = r(r(r(...r(rx)...)))

where there are  i-1  applications of  r  used for  x_i, one 
application of  l  used for  x_i  if  i<n  and no application of  l
used for  x_n.

A trick of this construction of binary products is that we define 
products twice. Given  n  sets  a_1, a_2,...,a_n  define their n-fold
PRE-PRODUCT as the set of pairs of the form  <x,n>  where  x  is an  
n-tuple such that  x_i \in  a_i  each relevant  i.

If two sets  x  and  y  arise as pre-products, that is, if there are
positive ordinals  m  and  n  and  sets  a_1, a_2,..., a_m, b_1, b_2,
...,b_n  such that  x  is the pre-product of the  a's  and  y  is the
product of the  b's, then we define their PRODUCT as the (m+n)-fold 
pre-product of  a_1, a_2,..., a_m, b_1, b_2,...,b_n.

Define  F(x) =  x  if  x  is a pre-product else { <y,1> | y \in x}.
Define the product of arbitrary  x  and  y  as the product of  F(x)
and  F(y).

Once again let me respond to Kai Bruennler's query:

  Is there a binary product in the category of sets and functions 
  that is "strictly associative", i.e.
  A x (B x C) = (A x B) x C   and
  the associativity isomorphisms are equal to the identity?

With the axiom of choice it's possible to construct such a product for
most categories that arise in nature. The needed condition (besides
having finite products) is that each isomorphism class be large enough
to accommodate the construction in the next sentence.

Given a category with a binary products let  O  be its objects and  O*
the finite strings of objects and choose a bijection  P:O* --> O  that
sends a string to a product thereof. (The condition, therefore, 
reduces to the condition that each isomorphism class be at least as 
large as the class of finite strings whose product is in that 
isomorphism class.)

Define a new binary product on objects by taking  

  P<A_1, A_2,..., A_m>  x  P<B_1, B_2,..., B_n>  =
                             P<A_1, A_2,..., A_m, B_1, B_2,..., B_n>.

As written, this construction does not work for the category of sets.
The problem is the empty set. The construction, though, continues to
work if the bijection condition is understood only for those strings
whose products are non-empty. The same trick works for any category 
with strict initial object.

Note that  1 x A  =  A  =  A x 1  where  1  denotes  P<>.

             The LINEAR International Summer School

                 (Linear Logic and Applications)

                 August 30 to September 7, 2000

        Hotel Terra Nostra, S.Miguel, Azores, Portugal


The Linear TMR research network (http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/LINEAR) is
proud to announce its first International Summer School on Linear
Logic and Applications.

The school is directed to everyone doing postgraduate work in
Computer Science or Mathematics with an interest in the field
of Formal Logic and its applications.

The school lasts one week and comprises both lectures and
thematic sessions. The lectures are in the tradition of summer
schools and cover one topic, from basic material to more advanced
issues. The topics and lecturers are the following:

      Samson Abramsky --- Game Semantics
      Jean-Yves Girard -- Linear Logic and Ludics
      Stefano Guerrini -- Proof-Nets and Lambda-Calculus
      Yves Lafont ------- Phase Semantics and Decision Problems
      Phil Scott -------- Category Theory and Concrete Models

The thematic sessions will cover state-of-the-art research in Linear
Logic. Each session has an organiser responsible for inviting speakers
who will talk about their work. The themes and organisers are the
following:

      Andrea Asperti ---- Applications
      Vincent Danos ----- Proof Theory
      Thomas Ehrhard ---- Semantics
      Glynn Winskel ----- Concurrency

The school will be held in the island of S.Miguel, Azores, amid
luxurious vegetation and hot water springs. The entrance to the mythic
kingdom of the Atlantis is believed to be located near Hotel Terra
Nostra, some say at the bottom of its famous red and hot water swimming
pool...

Detailed information and application forms are available at

==========================================================================

GENERAL INFORMATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IFIP TCS2000 is the first International Conference on Theoretical Computer 
Science organized by IFIP TC1 on Foundations of Computer Science, and it 
consists of two tracks: TRACK (1) on Algorithms, Complexity and Models of 
Computation, and TRACK (2) on Logic, Semantics, Specification, and 
Verification. The conference proceedings will be published as a volume
of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag.

IFIP TCS2000 will be held on the campus of Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.
The invited talks and contributed talks will be presented at the Aoba 
Memorial Building and Engineering Conference Hall, Faculty of Engineering 
located on the Aoba Hill about 3 km west of downtown Sendai. The conference
welcome reception and banquet will be held at Sendai Tokyu Hotel, located 
at downtown Sendai.

Please, register and make reservations by returning the completed form 
by email and fax, following the instructions below.
There will also be on-site registration at:
   * Sendai Tokyu Hotel, 15:00 - 20:00, August 16
   * Aoba Memorial Bldg., Tohoku Univ., 9:00 - 17:00 on August 17 - 19.

Transportation

Conference participants arriving at the new Tokyo International (Narita) 
Airport are advised to take the JR Narita Express train from Narita Airport
to Tokyo Station. 
Then, take the Yamabiko super express train of Tohoku Shinkansen (Tohoku 
Bullet Train) to Sendai from Tokyo Station. The Yamabiko runs every 20 - 30
min. and takes about 2 hours from Tokyo to Sendai. Making reservation at 
Narita Station for the Yamabiko is recommended, since it will be the summer
tourist season. 
Those arriving at the new Osaka International Airport (Kansai Airport) can
fly to Sendai Airport, and take Limousine Bus service to Sendai Station. 
The bus takes about 30 min. to go from the Airport to Sendai Station. You 
can also take a shuttle bus service from Kansai Airport to the Osaka-Itami 
Airport to fly from there to Sendai Airport. Alternatively, you can take a 
local train from the Kansai Airport to JR Shin Osaka Station, then take the
Tokaido Shinkansen from Osaka to Tokyo Station and change at Tokyo Station 
to Tohoku Shinkansen. 
Some details on transportation will be available on the TCS2000 Web page, at
        http://tcs2000.ito.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/tcs2000/
Note: 
(1) In Japan, mid-August is the busiest tourist time during summer, 
    including domestic and international flights. 
(2) No flight service is available from Narita to Sendai Airport, since the
    train service is convenient. There is another train service from Narita
    Airport to downtown Tokyo (Ueno) by Skyliner of the Keisei-Narita Line.
    At Ueno you can take the Yamabiko super express of Tohoku Shinkansen to
    Sendai, but you have to walk about 10 min. from Keisei-Ueno Station to 
    JR Ueno Station to take Tohoku Shinkansen.
(3) If you are going to travel in Japan by JR lines before/after the IFIP 
    TCS2000 conference, it will be convenient and economical to get a JR 
    PASS before your departure. Contact your travel agent for more 
    information on JR PASS (Japan Rail Pass).

Hotels

Two hotels are arranged to offer special discount rates to IFIP TCS2000 
participants: Sendai Tokyu Hotel and Sendai Washington Hotel. They are 
1.2 km west of Sendai Station and about 800 Yen by taxi from the station. 
These hotels are located within 5 min. walk from each other. The conference
welcome reception and banquet will be held at Sendai Tokyu Hotel.

Sendai and Climate

Sendai is the largest city in the northern part of the Honshu Island of 
Japan, with a population of about a million. The City is known in Japan 
as "City of Trees". Sendai is a modern, safe city with a temperate climate 
blessed by four distinct seasons; even in mid August it is quite seldom 
that the highest temperature exceeds 30 C (86 F). 
Usually, the weather in mid August would be mostly sunny with temperatures
ranging from 20 C (68 F) to 30 C (86 F), and rain, if any, would rarely be
heavy.
Note: Average temperatures in August at Sendai, Tokyo and Osaka are about 
      23.5 C, 26.5 C and 27.5, respectively.

 SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

 AMS Regional Meeting #957 in Toronto, September 22 - 24,
 Special Session on Applied Categorical Structures

Thanks to everybody who responded to our first announcement. With 19 talks
scheduled we have already exhausted the time slots available to us and are not
able to accommodate any further talks, unless we receive cancellations in the
very near future. Here is the current list of speakers:

 Steve Awodey, David Benson, Lars Birkedal, Marta Bunge, Robin Cockett, Jack
 Duskin, Marco Grandis, Andre Joyal, Jim Lambek, Bill Lawvere, James Madden,
 Michael Makkai, M.M. Mawanda, Bob Pare, Nico Pumpluen, Jiri Rosicky, Myles
 Tierney, Enrico Vitale, and Richard Wood.

All talks are 25-minute talks. Speakers are asked to provide us with the titles
of their talks by June 15. Furthermore, speakers must provide abstracts, to be
sent directly to the AMS, in accordance with AMS regulations, via web, email or
hard copy. The absolute deadline for receipt of abstracts by the AMS is July
14. We shall give further details in a subsequent mailing to speakers.

 Here is the block schedule for the Session:

 Friday, September 22,   8pm: Welcome Party for all participants in the Session
 Saturday, September 23, 9-11:30 am (5 talks)
                         3-5:30 pm  (5 talks)
 Sunday, September 24,   9-11:30 am (5 talks)
                         2-4 pm     (4 talks)

A detailed schedule will be contained in our final announcement, to be
communicated at the beginning of September.
All other relevant information (accommodation, fees, other sessions, invited
addresses) will be published in a forthcoming issue of the Notices of the AMS.
Please follow the registration/reservation procedures given there. We regret
not to be able to assist you with that. In making travel arrangements, please
note particularly that the Session will continue until 4 pm Sunday afternoon.

While the list of speakers is by necessity very limited, there is no limit to
the number of participants! We hope to see you in Toronto in the (very early)
fall.

1 - Scope

FTP 2000 (First-Order Theorem Proving), July 3-5, is the third in a
series of workshops intended to focus effort on First-Order Theorem
Proving as a core theme of Automated Deduction, and to provide a forum
for presentation of very recent work and discussion of research in
progress.

TABLEAUX 2000, July 4-7, is a continuation of international meetings
on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods held
since 1992.  The conference brings together researchers interested in
all aspects - theoretical foundations, implementation techniques,
systems development and applications - of the mechanization of
reasoning with tableaux and related methods.

FTP 2000 is held in conjunction with TABLEAUX 2000. The FTP 2000 and
TABLEAUX 2000 sessions will be partly in series, partly shared and
partly in parallel.

An intuitionistic version (in the sense of topos logic) of Tarski's
fixed-point theorem, by Dmitri Pataraia, was discussed in this list
some years ago. (I think it was presented in the PSSL in November
1997, but I didn't attend that.)

I've written a paper that uses this, and I would like to cite it
appropriately. Does anyone know if it has been published? (I didn't
find anything in MathSciNet or Zentralblatt MATH.)

(Maybe someone knows his e-mail address? I failed to find his
whereabouts using search engines.)

Thanks.

LOCATION AND SIGHTSEEING TOURS

    Georgia is the ancient country situated between Black and Caspian seas,
the Caucasus  and Turkey. It is the country of the Golden Fleece, the myth of
Argonauts, Jason and Medea, and Prometheus, chained to the Caucasus mountains.
Tbilisi - capital of Georgia - has more than 1 million in habitant. It is
situated some 100-150 km to the south of main Caucasus ridge, in the
beautiful valley of the river Mtkvari, surrounded by the green slopes of the
Caucasus spurs. The city has a long (1500 year old) history and abounds in
historical and cultural memorials. Georgia is famous for its high quality
wines, exquisite cuisine and cordial hospitality.

The main site of the Symposium, Tbilisi State University, is the chief
centre of education in the country, and has several outstanding scholars
in science, art and politics among its graduates.

During the School there will be an excursion over the famous Georgian
Military Road, which leads us through the  ancient capital of Georgia -
Mtskheta, with its abundant architectural and historical monuments - and
which brings us across the main ridge of the Caucasus by the Cross Pass.
The destination of the envisaged trip is the  mountain resort Kazbegi
with its Trinity Church situated on the top of high peak facing the second
mountain (after Elbrus), the peak of the Caucasus - Mkinvarcveri
(Glacier - mountain).


 TRAVEL INFORMATION

Tbilisi can only be reached  by air. If there are no direct trip between your
point of departure and Tbilisi, the most convenient connections are via
Istambul, Frankfurt or Moscow.

Dear Experts in Category Theory,

I am very interested in the following problem.
Let us consider the category Cat of small categories. I need for a "topology"
on Morph(Cat) (i.e., the functors between small categories), with the
following property:
For each u in Morph(Cat) and each D in Ob(Cat) there exist 
			v
		C------------>D
in Morph(Cat), a functor F:Cat----->Cat  with F(u) = v, and two "open
neighbourhoods" U and V of u and v, respectively, such that F (acting on
Morph(Cat)) is a "homeomorphism" between U and V.
I would be very grateful to you for any related comment.
With my best regards, I remain
Truly Yours
Adrian Duma.

Dear Colleagues,

I would like to announce three Lectureships in Computer Science, which
may be of interest to CATEGORIES and TYPES readers. 

Leicester has a research group working in Categories and Semantics
which includes Simon Ambler, Neil Ghani, Vincent Schmitt, Nobuko
Yoshida and myself.  Current research areas include Operational
Semantics, Mechanized Reasoning, Categorical Models of Programming
Languages including Concurrency, Categorical Term Rewriting, and
Enriched Category Theory.

These areas are directly or indirectly connected with the theory and
practice of categories and types.

Roy Crole.

Thanks to all of you who replied to my query. Dito Pataraia has kindly
sent me a copy of his manuscript.

Here are the details of the short note I've written based on that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
On the nuclear reflection of a prenucleus  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  There are at least three ways of obtaining the nuclear reflection of
  a prenucleus. We describe a fourth, based on an intuitionistic
  version of Tarski's fixed-point theorem due to Pataraia. As an
  illustration of the technique, we offer a simple intuitionistic
  proof of Johnstone's localic version of the Hofmann-Mislove theorem,
  which says that the compact fitted sublocales of any locale are in
  order-reversing bijection with the Scott open filters of opens.
