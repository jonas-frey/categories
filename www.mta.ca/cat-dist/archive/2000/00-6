  Bourse de doctorat à l'INRIA Sophia Antipolis
                Projet Lemme

le projet Lemme de l'INRIA Sophia Antipolis propose une bourse de
doctorat centrée sur les méthodes formelles basées sur Coq et sur la
description de langages de programmation adaptés aux cartes à puces.
Cette thèse s'intègrera dans le cadre d'une collaboration avec GemPlus,
entreprise à la pointe du développement des cartes à puces, Les
techniques étudiées devront permettre de développer des vérificateurs
de byte-code formellement certifiés pour des langages approximant le
langage JavaCard.  L'objectif à terme est de fournir un vérificateur
de byte-code entièrement prouvé correct pour le langage JavaCard tel
qu'il est défini par JavaSun.

L'étudiant travaillant avec cette bourse doctorale aura l'occasion
d'approfondir ses compétences dans un domaine à l'intersection des
domaines théoriques les plus ambitieux de la logique et de
l'informatique fondamentale et des champs d'applications les plus
dynamiques de l'évolution récente des technologies de l'information et 
de la communication (authentification, sécurité sur les réseaux,
commerce électronique...).

Les candidats intéressés devront envoyer un curriculum vitae et une
lettre de motivation à Yves Bertot (Yves.Bertot@sophia.inria.fr).

==================

In a collaboration with GemPlus, a leading company in the realm of
smartcards, the Lemme Project at INRIA Sophia Antipolis proposes a
PhD. grant centered around formal methods based on the Coq proof
system and the description of programming languages adapted to
smartcards.  The studied techniques should make it possible to develop 
formally certified bytecode verifiers for languages close to
JavaCard.  The long term objective is to provide a fully formalized
bytecode verifier for the whole JavaCard language.

The student working on this topic will have the opportunity to
strengthen her or his competence in a domain at the frontier between
theoretical computer science and the most recent and exciting
evolution of information and communication technology.

Applications should be sent with a curriculum vitae to Yves Bertot
(Yves.Bertot@sophia.inria.fr).

Nostra, S.Miguel, Azores, Portugal The Linear TMR research network
(http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/LINEAR) is proud to announce its first
International Summer School on Linear  Logic and Applications. The
school is directed to everyone doing postgraduate work in  Computer
Science or Mathematics with an interest in the field  of Formal Logic
and its applications. The school lasts one week and comprises both
lectures and  thematic sessions. The lectures are in the tradition of
summer  schools and cover one topic, from basic material to more
advanced  issues. The topics and lecturers are the following:
Samson Abramsky --- Game Semantics       Jean-Yves Girard -- Linear
Logic and Ludics       Stefano Guerrini -- Proof-Nets and
Lambda-Calculus       Yves Lafont ------- Phase Semantics and Decision
Problems       Phil Scott -------- Category Theory and Concrete Models
The thematic sessions will cover state-of-the-art research in  Linear
Logic. Each session has an organiser responsible for  inviting speakers
who will talk about their work. The themes  and organisers are the
following:       Andrea Asperti ---- Applications       Vincent Danos
----- Proof Theory       Thomas Ehrhard ---- Semantics       Glynn
Winskel ----- Concurrency The school will be held in the island of
S.Miguel, Azores, amid  luxurious vegetation and hot water springs. The
entrance to the  mythic kingdom of the Atlantis is believed to be
located near  Hotel Terra Nostra, some say at the bottom of its famous
red and  hot water swimming pool... Detailed information and application
forms are available at       http://linear.di.fc.ul.pt Don't forget to

The symmetric frame of a sup-lattice L is the frame freely generated by L
with sups being preserved in the presentation. Classically (ie, with the
truth value object being 2) it is easy to show that the injection of
generators is 1-1. Does anyone know whether this also holds in an
arbitrary topos?

Thanks,

                     Non-Artin Gluing in Recursion Theory
                   and Lifting in the Abstract Stone Duality

                       for "Category Theory 2000", Como

                  http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/author/TaylorP

    The analogy between `open' and `recursively enumerable' sets has long
    been a mainstay of theoretical computer science, but the traditional
    axiomatisation of general topology involving arbitrary unions is an
    obstacle to the formal unification of these disciplines.
    
    In particular, whilst Artin showed how to glue an open subspace
    to its closed complement using a comma square of frames, we give
    a diagonalisation argument to show that this representation fails for
    any recursively enumerable subset of $\mathbb N$ that is not decidable.
    
    Abstract Stone Duality is a re-axiomatisation based on the monadic
    adjunction between the dual categories of `frames' and `spaces'. Despite
    the failure of Artin gluing, we show in this formulation that the lift
    or scone, constructed using a comma square, still provides the classifier
    for partial maps with open domain of definition.  As the axiomatisation
    is not given in terms of finite intersections and arbitrary unions,
    a careful study of the modular law is needed to prove this.

I would very much like to receive comments and references to relevant work on
 *  Artin gluing and the partial map classifier FOR LOCALES (not toposes),
 *  modular lattices and the (Goursat?) equation  ab=bab  for idempotents.

I will be preparing an abridged version for the Como proceedings during the
last week in June, and submitting the paper to "Theory and Applications of
Categories" at the same time.

The first paper on "Abstract Stone Duality" has been with the TAC referees
for nearly a year.  Both can be found linked from my Hypatia page.

such persons will amount to $120 (excursion, banquet,
reprints, etc.). They could be comfortably
accommodated at Georgian families (with two meals) -
$40 per day.


LOCATION AND SIGHTSEEING TOURS

Georgia is the ancient country situated between Black
and Caspian seas, Caucasus Mountains and Turkey. This
is the country of Golden Fleece, myth of Argonauts,
Jason and Medea, Promethee, chained to the Caucasus
mountains.

Tbilisi - capital of Georgia - has more than 1 million
in habitant. It is situated some 100-150 km to the
south of main Caucasus ridge, in the beautiful valley
of the river Mtkvari, surrounded by the green slopes
of the Caucasus spurs. The city has a long (1500 year)
history and abounds in historical and cultural
memorials. Georgia is famous for its high quality
wines, exquisite cuisine and cordial hospitality.

The main site of the Symposium, Tbilisi state
University, is the chief centre of education in the
country, and has several outstanding scholars in
science, art and politics among its graduates.

As a route of excursion is chosen the Georgian
Military Road going via ancient capital of Georgia -
Mtskheta, with its abundant architectural and
historical monuments, crossing the main ridge of
Caucasus by the Cross Pass and reaching the final
point of supposed trip - mountain resort Kazbegi with
its Trinity Church situated on the top of high peak
facing the second
(after Elbrus) mountain - peak of Caucasus - 
Mkinvarcveri (Glacier - mountain).

TRAVEL INFORMATION

The only real way of arrival in Tbilisi is by air. If
direct flight from the point of your departure does
not exist, the preferable ways are via Istambul,
Frankfurt or Moscow.

I am wondering if anyone can give references for three remarks Wesley Phoa
makes in the chapter on fibrations of his paper "An introduction to
fibrations, topos theory, the effective topos and modest sets".  


1. Essentially Algebraic Theories

In the footnote on page 7 Phoa comments: 
	"[fibrations] are the models for a first-order, 'essentially
algebraic' theory".

I'm not quite sure what he means here, and this sounds like it must be a
standard and well known connection.  I'd be glad of a reference.


2. Splitting Fibrations

At the bottom of page 14 Phoa observes: 
	"Every fibration .. is equivalent to a split fibration (there is an
elegant proof due to John Power).  However, it's not clear how to extend
this result to more complicated structures.  This is the coherence problem
..."

Now I know that any fibration is equivalent to a split fibration via the
"fibred Yoneda lemma" (Borceux, "Handbook of Categorical Algebra 2", 8.2.7
and Jacobs, "Categorical Logic and Type Theory"), but I don't think that's
the only splitting available, and I'm not sure that this correspondence
helps very with coherence questions.
	I am aware of another, different, equivalent splitting, and I wonder
if there are any references.  In particular, can anyone guess what reference
by John Power Phoa was referring to?
	In particular, I'd be very interested in any other observations on
the "coherence problem".

3. Generalising the Definition

In the footnote on page 12, in reference to the definition of a fibration,
Phoa says: 
	"If one really wants to take .. 2-categorical issues seriously, one
needs .. a more sophisticated definition of 'fibration'."

I can make some promising looking guesses.  Any references?


Many thanks.

At this point, I think your best bet is to get a copy of Bart Jacobs
excellent book "Categorical Logic and Type Theory" - which (in spite
of its title?) is all about fibrations (and logic and type theory -
actually I think it is well-titled, though you might not have guessed
it was what you needed from the title).  (There is a review of this
book on my web page, link below.)

I think I can provide some meaningful answers to these questions, but of
course, one should always take such (throwaway) remarks in an informal
exposition with a pinch of black pepper.

Fibrations as finite-limit theories: This follows from the analysis in
[S], that exhibits fibrations as (adjoint) pseudo-algebras in any 2-category
with comma-objects. In particular, for any category B with pullbacks, the
2-category Cat(B) of internal categories in B admits them.

Split fibrations: Since fibrations are pseudo-algebras, it follows from Power's

coherence theorem [P] (which applies in this situation) that every fibration is

equivalent (over its base category) to a split one. The construction there does

not appeal to Yoneda. Yet, given that fibrations are actually properties, that
is adjoint pseudo-algebras, one can give a neat explicit description of the
associated split one as follows:

Given p:E->B, consider the free fibration over it, E/p -> B. The unit
\eta: E -> E/p takes X |-> X,id_(pX). The right adjoint r: E/p -> E amounts to
a choice of cartesian lifting: (Y,u:I->pY) |-> u*(Y). Thus we get a comonad
\eta o r: E/p -> E/p. The resulting Kleisli category (E/p)_(\eta r) is fibred
over B and gives the corresponding split fibration. The equivalence is given by
the composite E -\eta-> E/p -J-> (E/p)_(\eta r).

The above construction is a special case of the theory in [H], specially
section 11. The paper and the references there in provide further material on
coherence.

Generalised fibrations: The only meaningful generalisation (in the categorical
context) proposed so far in the literature is that of [S1], fibrations "up to
equivalence". However I can see no impediment whatsoever at taking 2-category
theory seriously with the standard (Grothendieck) notion of fibration, so I
cannot guess what the author means.

Does anyone know of any cases where Category Theory (morphisms, functors &
all that) has helped solve an unsolved problem?

That is, a problem in some other branch of math, posed without reference to
categorical ideas, and previously unsolved, that was first solved via
Category T.

I realize that CT provides a unifying framework for many seemingly disparate
ideas in math, and that is a fine thing of course; but I was just wondering
if it had this problem-solving capability.

TIA for any helpful responses.

I have a paper with Loday on calculating the third homotopy group of a
suspension of a K(G,1)

51. (with J.-L. LODAY), ``Van Kampen theorems for diagrams of spaces'',
{\em Topology} 26
(1987) 311-334. 

in terms of a new tensor product of non abelian groups. It would not be a
sensible task to rewrite the paper without category theory (considered as a
unifying principle, as a mode for efficient calculation in certain
algebraic structures,  and as a supplier of new algebraic structures). 

To go further back (and higher, of course) Grothendieck's extension of the
Riemann-Roch Theorem uses category theory explicitly. In the 1950's people
were trying to give algebraic proofs of this theorem, when AG came up with
an algebraic proof of a vast generalisation. Then there is the categorical
background to the proof of the Weil conjectures ....

But the question is misplaced - in the early part of the 20th century, I
expect some would ask if set theory was really necessary for a confirmed
problem solver! The history of maths shows that maths greatest contribution
to science, culture and technology has been in terms of expressive power,
to give a language for intuitions which enables exact description,
calculation, deduction. (Exam question: discuss the last statement, with an
emphasis on particular examples!) It also allows for the *formulation* of
new problems, which perhaps cause old interests to lapse as people perceive
there are more exciting things to do. It is a narrow view to regard
`important maths' as necessarily that which solves well known problems, and
so leave evaluation as akin to a sports league table: how old is the
problem? who has worked on it? etc, etc. The progress of maths is much more
complicated and interesting than that! It won't help the public image of
maths if it is seen that mathematicians believe the most important aspect
of their subject is a (to the public) bizarre set of problems which seem to
interest no one else. 

However, it is important that these questions be asked, together with
questions on modes for evaluating `good maths'. As AG remarked in a letter,
maths was held back for centuries for lack of the `trivial' concept of
zero! For more discussion, look at 

http://www.bangor.ac.uk/ma/CPM/cdbooklet/knots-m.html
                                         knots2.html

So let the debate be broadened and continued!

Ronnie Brown

(will someone please forward this to the newsgroup?)

PS I am trying to trace a combinatorics problem solved in the 1950s using
categories of paths, and which was at the time held up as the sort category
theory could not do! Maybe my memory is failing! But the question put on
the newsgroup is an old war horse!

I'm looking for definitions of (the weak 2-dimensional analogues of 1-)
products and coproducts for bicategories, and also adjoints. In his 1967
article "Introduction to Bicategories, Part I" Benabou promises to treat
biadjoints in a sequel, but I gather this was never published. Gray treats a
notion of "quasi-adjointness" in "Formal Category Theory"; is this accepted as
the "right" generalization?

Pointers to definitions of these concepts in one of the approaches to weak
n-categories would be welcome as well.

Computer Scientist, Biologist, Philosopher Win Kyoto Prizes

   Japan's Inamori Foundation on Friday named a computer scientist, a
   biologist, and a philosopher as this year's winners of the Kyoto
   Prizes, which are awarded annually to honor individuals who contribute
   to the scientific, cultural, or spiritual betterment of society.
   
   The winners will receive a special certificate and 50-million yen
   (approximately $477,000) at a ceremony in Kyoto on November 10.
   
   The winners and their achievements cited by the foundation, are:
   
     * Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare, a professor emeritus of computer
       science at the University of Oxford, in Britain, for "pioneering
       and fundamental contributions to software science."
     * Walter Jacob Gehring, a professor of developmental biology at the
       University of Basel, in Switzerland, for his "discovery of
       conserved developmental mechanisms."
     * Paul Ricoeur, a professor emeritus of philosophy at the University
       of Paris, in France, and at the University of Chicago, for "an
       imposing construct of hermeneutic phenomenology that embraces a
       new concept of ethics."

SCOPE

Both deduction systems and computer algebra systems are receiving
growing attention from industry and academia. On the one hand,
mathematical software systems have been commercially very
successful. Their use is now wide-spread in industry, education, and
scientific contexts. On the other hand, the use of formal methods in
hardware and software development has made deduction systems
indispensable not least because of the complexity and sheer size of
the reasoning tasks involved.  As many application domains fall
outside the scope of existing deduction systems and computer algebra
systems, there is still need for improvement and in particular need
for the integration of computer algebra and deduction systems.

The symposium is intended for researchers and developers interested in
combining the reasoning capabilities of deduction systems and the
computational power of computer algebra systems.


TOPICS 

Topics of interest for the symposium include all aspects related to the
combination of deduction systems and computer algebra systems. We
explicitly encourage submissions of results from applications and case
studies where such integration results are particularly important.


FORMAT

The symposium will feature invited talks, contributed presentations
with ample time for discussion, and a panel session.

Consistent with the tradition of the symposium as a lively forum for
discussing controversial ideas, we expect and encourage contributed
talks to present work in progress, rather than polished final results.


CONFERENCE LOCATION

CALCULEMUS 2000 will be held at St Andrews University, Scotland's
oldest university.  Visitors to St Andrews will discover a city full
of charm and historical interest, and golfers will be delighted by the
many famous and challenging golf courses in the area.  Travel
information can be found as

Dear colleagues,

a  preprint

M.Batanin, "On the Penon method of weakening of algebraic structures"
is available on

http://www.math.mq.edu.au/~mbatanin/papers.html



 I consider a generalization of the Penon approach to the definition
of weak $n$-category and compare his definition with mine.
I also correct one construction from my earlier paper about computads.

Regards,

Michael.

As is well-known, given a topos Y then the maps f: X -> Y targeted at it are
equivalent to toposes in the generalized universe of sets corresponding to
Y. Hence there is a correspondence between properties of maps and
constructive properties of toposes.

Unfortunately, they often have different names. For instance, in "Proper
maps of toposes", Moerdijk and Vermeulen have -

   compact (for toposes) vs. proper (for maps)
   strongly compact vs. tidy
   Stone vs. entire
   compact Hausdorff vs. separated (a.k.a. proper)

Furthermore, sometimes f is genuinely to be thought of as a map, with X and
Y toposes over some base topos B, and the properties can be relativized to
B. For instance, Moerdijk and Vermeulen define "proper relative to B", and
then "proper" unqualified means "proper relative to the target (Y)". More
names can arise from this; for instance, "proper relative to 1" has been
called - at least for locales - "semiproper", "perfect" or even "proper".

Does anyone have suggestions of systematic terminology - other than
systematically calling everything "proper" - that avoids this proliferation
of names?
