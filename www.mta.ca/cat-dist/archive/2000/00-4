Has anyone seen this before, or can anyone give a principled
explanation.  Begin with the following observation. Suppose
       del            del
  ... -----> (C_n,d) -----> (C_{n-1},d) ---> ... ---> (C_0,d) --> 0
 is a chain complex of differential abelian groups, except that we
assume d.del = -del.d.  Suppose (C_n,d) is exact for each n. Let C be
the direct sum of the C_n with boundary given by the matrix
          (   d     0     0   ...    )
          (  del    d     0   ...    )
          (   0    del    d   ...    )
          (   .     .     .   .      )
          (   .     .     .    .     )
          (   .     .     .     .    )
 The finite truncations F^n = C_0 +...+ C_n are readily
shown to be exact:  F^0 = C_0 is by hypothesis and there is an exact
sequence     0 --> F^{n-1} --> F^n --> C_n --> 0.  AB5 now shows that
the direct limit, which is C, is exact.

Of course, this is going to be false for a category, such as compact
abelian groups, that is not AB5.  Except it is true.  Using duality, we
can translate it to the following statement for abelian groups.  Suppose
       del            del
  ... <----- (C_n,d) <----- (C_{n-1},d) <--- ... <--- (C_0,d) <-- 0
 is a cochain complex of differential abelian groups, except that we
assume d.del = -del.d.  Suppose (C_n,d) is exact for each n. Let C be
the direct product of the C_n with boundary given by the matrix
          (   d    del    0   ...    )
          (   0     d    del  ...    )
          (   0     0     d   ...    )
          (   .     .     .   .      )
          (   .     .     .    .     )
          (   .     .     .     .    )
 then C is exact.  The proof is by using elements and although AB4 (at
least countable) is clearly a necessary condition for this (it is the
case that all the del's are 0), it sure doesn't look sufficient.

BTW, both are false if you change direct sum to product in the first or
product to sum in the second.

A day after I sent my previous note, I realized the (or an) answer.  In
fact, I seem to have discovered a new infinite exactness condition that
is between AB4 and AB5 and, inevitably, I call AB4.5.  So far I know
only that it is implied by AB5, implies AB4 and, since module categories
satisfy both AB5 and AB4.5*, it is definitely weaker than AB5.  I do
not, at this time, know that it is stronger than AB4.

Here is how it works.  Call a poset superdirected if it is directed and
all down segments are finite.  The natural numbers is one example and
the set of finite subsets of any set is another.  If I is superdirected,
A an abelian category and F,G:  I --> A are two diagrams, say that a
natural transformation alpha:  F --> G is supernatural (OK, suggestions
for better names welcome) if for any i in I, the following:  Look at the
diagram consisting of all the Fj for j =< i and all the Gj for j < i.
The arrows in the diagram are all the alpha j, for j =< i, as well as
all the arrows from the restrictions of F and G. The diagram has a
cocone to Gi and that cocone is monic (meaning the natural map from the
colimit to Gi is monic) for each i in I, call alpha supernatural.  Now
the condition is that whenever alpha is supernatural, the induced colim
F --> colim G is monic.

To see that this implies AB4, suppose for all x in X, A_x >--> B_x.  Let
I consist of all the finite subsets of X.  For i in I, let Fi be the
direct sum of all the A_x, x in i and Gi be the direct sum of the
correspnding B_x.  The supernaturality is satisfied and hence the sum of
the A_x maps monically to the sum of the B_x.

The application to my question comes as follows.  To recall, I am
supposing that
       del            del
  ... -----> (C_n,d) -----> (C_{n-1},d) ---> ... ---> (C_0,d) --> 0
 is a chain complex of differential abelian groups, except that we
assume d.del = -del.d.  Suppose (C_n,d) is exact for each n. Let C be
the direct sum of the C_n with boundary given by the matrix
          (   d     0     0   ...    )
          (  del    d     0   ...    )
          (   0    del    d   ...    )
          (   .     .     .   .      )
          (   .     .     .    .     )
          (   .     .     .     .    )
 The finite truncations F^n = C_0 +...+ C_n are readily
shown to be exact:  F^0 = C_0 is by hypothesis and there is an exact
sequence     0 --> F^{n-1} --> F^n --> C_n --> 0.  Thus each F^n is
exact.  Now let Z^n and B^n be the kernel and image, resp. of the
boundary operator on F^n. Then the rows of
       0 ----> Z^n -------> F^n -------> B^n ----> 0
                |            |            |
                |            |            |
                |            |            |
                v            v            v
       0 --> Z^{n+1} ---> F^{n+1} ---> B^{n+1} --> 0
 Since the right hand vertical arrow is monic, it follows that the left
hand square is a pullback, which in turn implies that the induced map
F^n +_{Z^n} Z^{n+1} ---> F^{n+1} is monic.  Taking colimits, and using
this Ab4.5 condition together with the right exactness of
colimits implies that 0 --> colim Z^n --> C --> B --> 0 is exact, so
that Z = colim Z^n and then B^n = Z^n for all n implies B = Z.

As for AB4.5* on module categories (for which it is sufficient to prove
it for Ab), it is a bit complicated notationally for this medium, but
not hard.  The point is that when you try to construct an element in the
inverse limit, the crucial thing is that you can do it one index at a
time and no choice you make at an earlier stage ever has to be changed
at a later one, so you can just continue.  Of course, AC is involved.
This might a way to find a category that satisfies AB4*, but not AB4.5*;
the trouble is that AC is also used to show AB4*.

Of course, Peter is correct below, since Gi is not part of the diagram
(although Fi is).

One more thing.  The reason that B^n --> B^{n+1} is monic (which is
crucial) is that they are subgroups of F^n and F^{n+1} resp.

One thing I found curious is that in any commutative diagram with exact
rows

         0 ----> A -----> B -----> C -----> 0
                 |        |        |
                 |        |        |
                 |        |        |
                 v        v        v
         0 ----> A' ----> B' ----> C' ----> 0
 
if C ---> C ' is monic, then so is A' +_A B ---> B'.  Well it turns out
that there is an exact sequence

    0 ---> ker (C --> C') ---> A' +_A B ---> B' 

I don't see this as coming from the snake lemma, but who knows.

 The first inequality below should be  j < i?

The arrows in the diagram are all the alpha j, for j =< i, as well as
all the arrows from the restrictions of F and G. The diagram has a
cocone to Gi and that cocone is monic (meaning the natural map from the
colimit to Gi is monic) for each i in I, call alpha supernatural.  Now
the condition is that whenever alpha is supernatural, the induced colim
F --> colim G is monic.

Brief Abstract:
In this paper we describe a deductive system for categories with finite
products and coproducts, prove decidability of equality of morphisms
via cut elimination, and prove a "Whitman theorem" for the free such
categories over arbitrary base categories.  This result provides a nice
illustration of some basic techniques in categorical proof theory, and
also seems to have slipped past unproved in previous work in this field.

Notes:
Since this material might seem rather close to the sort of categorical
proof theory done in the past 2-3 decades, we feel we ought to point
out some features which distinguish it from what others have done.
Some comments concerning its novelty might help the reader attune
himself to some points that otherwise might slip past unnoticed.

We present a correspondence between the doctrine of categories with
finite sums and products (without any assumption of distributivity),
and a "Lambek style" deductive system. But note that unlike the work
of Joyal's on the bicompletion of categories, our construction of the
free category does not use an inductive chain of constructions,
alternating between completions and cocompletions.  In this finite
case, it is natural do both finite completions (but only for sums and
products) in one step.  Our proof of cut elimination and
Church--Rosser does not make sense without finiteness however.  A
comment: decidability for categories with finite sums and products
seems a result that we ought not to have overlooked all this time, but
we cannot find any reference to this in the literature.  Of course,
comments are welcome.

Next, unlike the related work on categories with finite products (or
sums, but not both), with or without cartesian closedness, we cannot
rely only on directed rewrites ("reductions") but must also make
essential use of two-way rewrites (which we might call "equations").
Hence we need to use the theory of reduction systems modulo equations;
in particular, we need to strengthen an old result of Huet's in this
connection.  Our use of such systems to provide a decision procedure
for the equality of derivations is not particularly common in
categorical cut elimination, but it was a key ingredient in our
earlier work on linearly distributive categories and *-autonomous
categories [BCST]. Its reappearance here in a slightly different guise
is one of the highlights of the present paper, we think.  Finally, we
drawn the reader's attention to the fact that in setting up the
equivalence relation for the category induced by the deductive system,
we need not assume the categorical axioms of identity (apart from
atomic instances) and associativity - these follow from the cut
elimination process. This is not unusual in working with free logics,
but may be somewhat less familiar to the reader in the present case of
logic over an arbitrary category.  Small points individually, but
together they give this result a slightly different flavour from its
long-familiar relations.

   The IFIP WG 1.7 on "Theoretical Foundations of Security Analysis and
   Design" has been recently established to investigate the theoretical
   foundations of security, discovering and promoting new areas of
   application of theoretical techniques in computer security and supporting
   the systematic use of formal techniques in the development of security
   related applications.  The members of WG will hold their annual workshop
   as an open event to which all researchers working on the theory of
   computer security are invited.
   The program will encourage discussions by all attendees, both during and
   after scheduled presentations on participants' ongoing work.  Extended
   abstracts of work presented at the Workshop will be collected and
   distributed to the participants; no proceedings are foreseen for this
   year's workshop.

POSSIBLE TOPICS FOR SUBMITTED PAPERS:
   Researchers are invited to submit abstracts of original work on topics in
   the spirit of the workshop.  Possible topics for submitted papers
   include, but are not limited to:
   - formal definition and verification of the various aspects of security:
     confidentiality, integrity, authentication and availability;
   - new theoretically-based techniques for the formal analysis and design
     of cryptographic protocols and their manifold applications (e.g.,
     electronic commerce);
   - information flow modelling and its application to the theory of
     confidentiality policies, composition of systems, and covert channel
     analysis;
   - formal techniques for the analysis and verification of mobile code;
   - formal analysis and design for prevention of denial of service.

The file ab45.zip, that includes both the dvi and ps version, is now
available at ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr.  It is a preliminary version
because I want to investigate if the condition is really stronger than
AB4.  The following consideration raises the possibility that it might not
be.  One place to look to distinguish AB4* from AB4.5* might be in the
abelian groups of a topos.  But in order for the abelian groups of a topos
to satisfy AB4*, you need AC (in the topos).  But AC implies dependent
choice and then it looks like you have AB4.5*, which really is just like
dependent choice.

                    Final CALL FOR PAPERS
          

                    LICS'2000 Workshop on

               Chu Spaces: Theory and Applications

          Sunday, June 25, 2000, Santa Barbara, California

              http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vdp/chu.html

          ****Submission deadline: April,25, 2000****

A Chu space is a related pair of complementary objects.
Besides having intrinsic interest in their own right, Chu spaces
have found applications to concurrent processes, information flow,
linear logic, proof theory, and universal categories.  The workshop is
concerned with the theory and applications of Chu spaces, as well as
related structures such as the Dialectica construction and double glueing.

The workshop will bring together computer scientists, mathematicians,
logicians, philosophers, and other interested parties to discuss the
development of the subject with regard to its foundations, applications,
prospects, and directions for future work.  Work in the subject is
currently fragmented across several areas: category theory, traditional
model theory, concurrency, and the semantics of programming languages,
and such a workshop can contribute to the coordination and possibly even
some unification of these efforts.

Suggested topics for presentation and discussion include but are by no
means limited to new results about Chu spaces and related structures;
their applications to various areas such as concurrency, games, proof
theory, etc.; and their implications for foundations and philosophy of
computation, mathematics, physics, and other disciplines.

The workshop will be held on Sunday, June 25, 2000 at Santa Barbara,
California, as an adjunct to the International Conference on Logic in
Computer Science (LICS'2000), June 26-29 at the same location as per
http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/libkin/lics/index.html.

Papers within the scope of the workshop are solicited, and may be either
work in progress or more mature work.  Submission should be in the form
of an extended abstract of at most 10 pages, in postscript format, mailed
electronically to paiva@parc.xerox.com.  Submissions will be evaluated
by a committee selected by the organizers, and the full version of
accepted papers will be printed in a proceedings available at the start
of the workshop.

Important dates:

    Extended abstract:          April 25, 2000
    Notification of acceptance: May 15, 2000
    Proceedings version:        June 9, 2000

The workshop will be one full day and is open to all interested
researchers.

Realizability: A Historical Essay
http://www.math.uu.nl/publications/preprints/1131.ps.gz

Abstract: historical survey on Realizability. Focuses on
notions of realizability used in the study of metamathematics of
arithmetical theories, and topos-theoretic developments.
Bibliography contains 96 items.24 pages

Lars Birkedal and Jaap van Oosten
Relative and Modified Relative Realizability
http://www.math.uu.nl/publications/preprints/1146.ps.gz

Abstract: We approach `relative realizability' from an abstract point
of view, studying internal partial combinatory algebras in an
arbitrary topos E. Let RT(E,A) denote the standard realizability
topos over E w.r.t. A.
We define the notion of `elementary subobject'
in a topos; if, for two internal pca's A and B in E, there is
an embedding which maps A as elementary subobject into B, there
is a local geometric morphism from RT(E,B) to RT(E,A).
Next we study the situation where an internal topology j is given;
we have a tripos over E using only the j-closed subobjects of A,
giving a topos RTj(E,A). RTj(E,A) is a subtopos of RT(E,A) and we
have a pullback diagram of toposes:

  Sh_j(E)--->RTj(E,A)
    |           |
    |           |
    V           V
    E   ---->  RT(E,A)

If A--> B is an embedding with A elementary subobject of B, the local
geometric morphism restricts to a local geometric morphism:
RTj(E,B)-->RTj(E,A)
Moreover if A --> B is a j-dense embedding, there is a logical functor
(a filter-quotient situation): RTj(E,A) --> RTj(E,B).
If j is an open topology, the inclusion RTj(E,A)-->RT(E,A) is open
too, and it makes sense to consider its closed complement; we call this
the modified relative realizability topos Mj(E,A) w.r.t. A and j.
We have an automatic pullback diagram

  Sh_k(E)---->Mj(E,A)
    |           |
    |           |
    V           V
    E  ---->  RT(E,A)

where k denotes the closed complement of j.
In a section `Examples' we show that our treatment generalizes former
definitions of relative realizability (in Awodey, Birkedal, Scott) and
modified realizability.

Hello,

In his 1974 paper Osius showed that there are enough transitive objects
in the initial topos to define a naive set theory. He then goes on the
assume his topoi are well-pointedness and produces a characterisation of
the category of sets in terms familiar to set theorists. I'm wondering
whether anyone has produced an axiomatic set theory from Osius' naive
set theory which characterises the initial topos.

Elwood Wilkins reminds us that...

Gerhard Osius's work was significant in 1974 as one of the ways in which
it was shown that toposes do the same thing as set theory.   In fact Osius's
is, so far as I am aware, the only work that discusses *set* theory -
Benabou, Joyal, Mitchell, Lawvere etc showed that toposes do the same thing
as some form of *type* theory.  Of course, it is the latter that
mathematicians actually use when they claim to be using set theory
as foundations, but set theory - epsilontics as Lawvere calls it - is of
some interest in the study of very high powered induction.

Peter Johnstone included a precis of Osius's paper in his book "Topos Theory"
(Academic Press, 1977). Apart from that, I was unable to track down anything
that built significantly on it.  Indeed,  Osius himself didn't seem very
interested when I wrote to him about it (he now does statistics).

The successor to this paper would therefore seem to be my
     "Intuitionistic Sets and Ordinals", J. Symbolic Logic, 61 (1996) 705--744
This develops, in a symbolic way, the notions of "transitive set" and
"ordinal" in the sense of a carrier equipped with an extensional well founded
relation.  Several qualitatively different notions of ordinal arise
intuitionistically.  I also pick up on Osius's set theory and pose some
questions that suggest ways of adapting it to Grothendieck toposes in general.

What remains of considerable interest (once we have agreed that set theory
is wrong, wrong, wrong) is Osius's categorical notion of recursion.

The equation       f(x)  =   r( { f(y) | y in [=element_of] x } )

he writes as the (3=1, not 2=2) commutative square

                            P(f)
  { y | y in x }   P(X)  --------->   P(A)
       ^            ^                  |
       |            |                  |
       |            |                  |
       |            |                  | r
       |            |                  |
       |            |                  |
       -            |        f         v
       x            X  ------------->  A

which we may of course generalise to a "homomorphism" from any P-coalgebra
to any P-algebra, where indeed P may be any functor instead of the covariant
powerset functor.  The coalgebra admits recursion by definition if there is
exactly one such "homomorphism" to any algebra whatever.

The exercises in Chapter VI of my book "Practical Foundations of Mathematics"
(Cambridge University Press, 1999) explore applications of the commutative
square to recursive functional programs.
      http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations/html/s6e.html

Osius's 3+1 square is about RECURSION - defining functions or programs -
but I have also considered INDUCTION - proving theorems - categorically.

Again this is a property ("well foundedness") of coalgebras.  See Section 6.3
      http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations/html/s63.html
of the book, or my unfinished paper "Towards a Unified Treatment of Induction"
(also known as "On the General Recursion Theorem") which you can get from
my Hypatia page
      http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/author/TaylorP

The final section of the book (s96.html) sketches the way in which this
categorical notion of ordinal can be used to define transfinite iterates of
a functor (for example, internally in a topos).   I hope to use this to
develop categorical notions of the Axiom of Replacement.

Osius showed that well-pointed topoi do essentially the same thing as set theory.
I have yet to find any adequate analogy between what elementary topoi in general
do and set theory. The problem being, as far as I can see, that classical set
theory finds it very difficult to describe the rather more subtle behaviour
occurring in the initial topos. Whence the standard set theoretic account of
topos logic includes the assumption that bound variables denote, which make the
semantics of elementary topoi almost identical to those of well-pointed ones (for
instance every proper subtype of 1 is treated as though it is empty!).

In practice this is true, but not if they're interested in actually studying the
foundations of maths. My (set minded) colleagues point out (quite forcibly) that
unless something is expressible in ZF (say) then they find it hard to accept, a
view that appears to be widespread in the theoretical end of computer science.
Now I have the practical problem of convincing people that what I do
constructively is better than what they do with their "bound variables denote"
assumptions, and an axiomatic set theory equivalent to the initial topos would
make this much easier: they could go away contentedly believing that I'm really
doing set theory (while I can be happy with the knowledge that they're doing
typed theory).

There are potential applications to category theory from producing a set theory.
For instance one might speculate that this set theory could replace the rather
cumbersome Freyd cover in the proof of the constructive properties of the initial
topos. A host of other speculations can be formulated ...

Dear categoricians,

Is there any formalization of process algebras in term of categories? I
would be interested in giving an computational, multi-process semantics
to certain graphs, and I thought it could be done in terms of a functor
to a process category (if this concept exists...)
Is there any literature about this?
Thank you for your help,

Another few papers which may be of interest are:

"Constructing process categories"
J.R,B. Cockett (me!) & D.A. Spooner
TCS 177 (1997) 73-109

"Categories for syncrony and asynchrony"
J.R,B. Cockett & D.A. Spooner
Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science I (1995) 495-520

These papers explore the "combinatorial" representation of processes 
using span categories.  In particular they give an account of
Abramsky's program to model processes (based on a CCS style 
presentation) using span categories.

around 1995, i had two papers about "convenient categories for process
calculus" and one about "categorical logic of concurrency and
interaction". the simplest way to get them is probably on hypatia, or from
my web page http://www.kestrel.edu/HTML/people/pavlovic/ i am not sure to
which extent is this what you are looking for, but it is surely related.
later samson abramsky and i figured how to deal with process categories
much better, but most of it was never written up. an initial account was

Here's a paper that might be of interest to some category theorists,
although it's actually aimed at a general audience, and secretly tries
to get them interested in categories.  Later we'll write a more technical
paper about Feynman diagrams and `stuff operators'.

>From Finite Sets to Feynman Diagrams
John C. Baez and James Dolan

To appear in "Mathematics Unlimited - 2001 and Beyond",
eds. Bjorn Engquist and Wilfried Schmid, Springer Verlag.

Abstract: `Categorification' is the process of replacing equations by
isomorphisms.  We describe some of the ways a thoroughgoing emphasis on
categorification can simplify and unify mathematics.  We begin with
elementary arithmetic, where the category of finite sets serves as a
categorified version of the set of natural numbers, with disjoint union
and Cartesian product playing the role of addition and multiplication.
We sketch how categorifying the integers leads naturally to the infinite
loop space Omega^infinity S^infinity, and how categorifying the positive
rationals leads naturally to a notion of the `homotopy cardinality' of a
tame space.  Then we show how categorifying formal power series leads to
Joyal's `especes des structures', or `structure types'.  We also
describe a useful generalization of structure types called `stuff
types'.  There is an inner product of stuff types that makes the
category of stuff types into a categorified version of the Hilbert space
of the quantized harmonic oscillator.  We conclude by sketching how this
idea gives a nice explanation of the combinatorics of Feynman diagrams.

UNIVERSITY OF AARHUS

DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE


A tenured position as associate professor in the area of Logic in
Computer Science, i.e. computational logic in a broad sense, is
available at the Department of Computer Science, starting August 1,
2000. Ideally we seek applicants who as well as exhibiting a broad and
impressive knowledge of Logic applicable in Computer Science, are able
to support and encourage Logic on a broad front within the department.
As a minimum requirement, applicants must have documented scientific
qualifications within the area (equivalent to a PhD plus at least 2-3
years additional research and teaching).

The Department conducts research and teaching in theoretical as well as
experimental computer science. The staff is close to 200 people,
including 25 full or associate professors, and 50 PhD students. The
number of M.Sc. students is approximately 500. The position is intended
to strengthen the Department's existing research group in Theoretical
Computer Science, and will be associated with Research Centre BRICS
(http:www.brics.dk/).

Applicants must submit a curriculum vitae, a description of scientific
accomplishments, future research plans and participation in research
programmes, a description of  teaching experience, a list of
publications (all in 4 copies), and 3 copies of publications  to be
considered in the evaluation.

The Faculty refers  to the Ministerial Order No. 650 of 31.8.1998 on the
appointment of  teaching and research staff at the universities under
the Ministry of Research and Information Technology.

Applications should be addressed to The Faculty of Science, University
of Aarhus, Ny Munkegade, Building 520, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark, and
marked  212/5-189

The deadline for receipt of all applications is May 10, 2000, at 12,00.

For more information, please contact the head of the department Kurt
Jensen (e-mail: kjensen@daimi.au.dk. Phone: +45 8942 5612) or consult
the Web pages: http://www.daimi.au.dk/

In section 5 of his Esquisse d'un Programme, in connection 
with tame topology, Grothendieck says he was able to convince 
himself that a formalism of devissage had some meaning in 
the context of topoi, via a suitable notion of "canonical 
tubular neighborhood of a subtopos" in an ambient topos. 

Has anyone besides Grothendieck pursued this idea? 

Thanks, 

Todd
