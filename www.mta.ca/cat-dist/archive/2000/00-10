J.J.M.M. Rutten
Behavioural differential equations: a coinductive calculus of 
streams, automata, and power series
Technical Report SEN-R0023, CWI, Amsterdam, 2000.

Abstract:
Streams, (automata and) languages, and formal power series
are viewed coalgebraically.  In summary, this amounts to 
supplying these sets with a deterministic automaton structure,
which has the universal property of being final. 
Finality then forms the basis for both definitions
and proofs by coinduction, the coalgebraic counterpart
of induction. Coinductive definitions take the shape of what we have 
called behavioural differential equations, after Brzozowski's 
notion of input derivative. A calculus is developed for 
coinductive reasoning about all of the afore mentioned structures,
closely resembling (and at times generalising aspects of) calculus
from classical analysis.

(This report combines and extends earlier papers
on automata and languages (CONCUR '98) and
formal power series (ICALP '99).)

The following manuscripts are available on request, or can be downloaded in 
postscript form from
http://www.aucegypt.edu/schools/sse/maths/Staff/Hebert/HebertHomePage.htm


On abstract data types presented by multiequations
J.Adamek, M Hebert, J.Rosicky.

Abstract:
Equational presentation of abstract data types is generalized to presentation 
by multiequations, i.e., exclusive-or's of equations, in order to capture 
parametric data types such as array or set. Multiinitial-algebra semantics for 
such data types is introduced. Classes of algebras described by multiequations 
are characterized.


Uncountable orthogonality is a closure property
M.Hebert, J.Rosicky

Abstract:
We show that, for lambda-orthogonality classes in locally lambda-presentable 
categories coincide with full subcategories closed under limits and 
lambda-directed colimits. This comes as a surprise, since the statement is 
known to be false for lambda = omega.


More on orthogonality in locally presentable categories
M. Hebert, J. Adamek and J. Rosicky

Abstract:
A new solution of the orthogonal subcategory problem in locally presentable 
categories is exhibited, substantially different from the classical one of 
Gabriel and Ulmer.
It has various applications: we use it to characterize omega-orthogonality 
classes in locally finitely presentable categories, i.e., the full 
subcategories orthogonal to a set of morphisms the domains and codomains of 
which are finitely presentable. We also use it to find a sufficient condition 
for reflectivity of subcategories of accessible categories. And finally, we 
describe categories of fractions in all small, finitely complete categories.


Lambda*-injectivity + special lambda-compactness =  lambda-injectivity
Michel Hébert

Abstract:
J.Rosicky, J.Adamek and F.Borceux recently showed that lambda-injectivity 
classes in locally presentable categories are precisely the classes closed 
under products, lambda-filtered colimits and lambda-pure subobjects. We 
present a simpler and more conceptual proof of this result, obtaining it as a 
consequence of our characterization of lambda-injectivity classes (JPAA 129 
(1998) 143-147) and of an infinitary compactness result.

            Keltic Lodge, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada


Sponsored by the Technical Committee on Security and Privacy
of the IEEE Computer Society

This workshop series brings together researchers in computer science
to examine foundational issues in computer security. For background
information about the workshop, and an html version of this Call for
Papers, see the CSFW home page http://www.csl.sri.com/csfw/csfw14/

This year the workshop will be in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada.

We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories.  Both papers
and panel proposals are welcome.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to: 

access control       authentication        data and system integrity
database security    network security      distributed systems security
anonymity            intrusion detection   security for mobile computing
security protocols   security models       decidability issues
privacy              executable content    formal methods for security
information flow

The proceedings are published by the IEEE Computer Society and will be
available at the workshop.  Selected papers will be invited for
submission to the Journal of Computer Security.

Instructions for Participants 
-----------------------------

Submission is open to anyone.  Workshop attendance is limited to about
40 participants.  Submitted papers must not substantially overlap
papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted
to a journal or a conference with a proceedings.  Papers should be at
most 20 pages excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices
(using 11-point font, single column format, and reasonable margins on
8.5"x11" paper), and at most 25 pages total.  The page limit will be
strictly adhered to.  Committee members are not required to read the
appendices, and so the paper should be intelligible without them.
Proposals for panels should be no longer than five pages in length and
should include possible panelists and an indication of which of those
panelists have confirmed participation.  

To submit a paper, send to s.schneider@rhbnc.ac.uk a plain ASCII text
email containing the title and abstract of your paper, the authors'
names, email and postal addresses, phone and fax numbers, and
identification of the contact author.  To the same message, attach
your submission (as a MIME attachment) in PDF or portable postscript
format.  Do not send files formatted for word processing
packages (e.g., Microsoft Word or WordPerfect files).  

Submissions received after the submission deadline or failing to
conform to the guidelines above risk rejection without consideration
of their merits.  Where possible all further communications to authors
will be via email.  If for some reason you cannot conform to these
submission guidelines, please contact the program chair at 
s.schneider@rhbnc.ac.uk.

Workshop Location
-----------------

The workshop will be held at the Keltic Lodge in beautiful Cape
Breton, Nova Scotia.  Located on a narrow peninsula on the Atlantic
Ocean, the Lodge's comfortable rooms offer breathtaking views of the
rugged shore, vibrant in sunny days and majestic when shrouded in
mist.  Activities on the premises include tennis, swimming in the
heated pool, golf, and mountain biking.  The picturesque fishing
villages along the scenic Cabot Trail offer opportunities to get
acquainted with the local lifestyle and also to embark in such
activities as ocean swimming, whale watching, and sea kayaking.
Moose, bears and other wildlife are often seen while hiking and
camping in the surrounding Cape Breton Highlands National Park.  Cape
Breton also hosts the final home of Alexander Graham Bell and the
station from which Guglielmo Marconi transmitted the first recorded
East-bound radio signal across the Atlantic.

The Keltic Lodge is 4 hours by car from Halifax International Airport
along a magnificent drive.  There are direct flights between Halifax
and numerous European and American cities.  Sydney Regional Airport is
1 1/2 hours by car from the Keltic Lodge and has flights every 2 hours
to Halifax.  People attending LICS 2001 in Boston may also consider
the ferry between Portland, ME and Yarmouth, NS.  More travel
information can be found from the CSFW website.

This is a correction to the talk I gave in Toronto on the 24th of
September. In the definition of "principal computad" (on page 8 of the
slides, for those who have copies of the slides) a clause was omitted. The
definition should read as follows (clause (c) was missing):

	The computad A is *principal* if (a) A is finite, (b) there is a
unique indeterminate of maximal dimension in A, say x; and (c) there is no
proper subcomputad of A containing x.

I add that there was another error in the slides, although it was caught
during the talk and corrected on the projected slide (but not on the
copies). On page 11 of the slides, "fibration" should be "trivial
fibration".

   New book! 
   G. Stefanescu, Network Algebra, 
   Springer-Verlag, London/Berlin/...

   Network Algebra considers the algebraic study of networks
   and their behaviour. It contains general results on the
   algebraic theory of networks, recent results on the
   algebraic theory of models for parallel programs, as well as
   results on the algebraic theory of classical control
   structures. The results are presented in a unified framework
   of the calculus of flownomials, leading to a sound
   understanding of the algebraic fundamentals of the network
   theory. Network Algebra will be of interest to anyone
   interested in network theory or its applications and
   provides them with the results needed to put their work on a
   firm basis. Graduate students will also find the material
   within this book useful for their studies.

I have just posted two papers to ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr.  The first
is:
 mackey
     M. Barr and H. Kleisli, On Mackey topologies in topological abelian
     groups.  Submitted to TAC.

The main result can be described as follows:  Let C be a full subcategory
of topological abelian groups that includes the circle group T and closed
under subobjects and projects.  For a group A, let A^ denote the abstract
group of all its characters, that is continuous homomorphisms to the
circle. If A is an object of C, say that A' has a compatible topology if
it has the same elements and the same characters are A and say that A' has
a Mackey topology if it has the finest compatible topology.  Say that C
has Mackey coreflections if the inclusion of the full subcategory of
Mackey groups has a right adjoint.  Then we show, among other things, that
the existence of Mackey coreflections is equivalent to the injectivity of
the circle in C and then the Mackey category is equivalent to chu(Ab,T).



The second is:
 tvs
     On *-autonomous categories of topological vector spaces.  To appear
     in Cahiers de Topologie et Geometrie Differentielle Categorique.
 
The main result here is that the category of Mackey spaces (defined
similarly in terms of continuous linear functionals and proved by Mackey
to be coreflective) among the locally convex TV spaces is equivalent to
chu(Vect,K), where K is the field of scalars (either R or C) and is
therefore *-autonomous.  Another fact adduced is that--unusually--
chu(Vect,K) is a *-autonomous subcategory of Chu(Vect,K).  



Sometime in the next week or so, I will be posting 
derfun
Effaceable resolutions and derived functors.  Submitted to HHA.

It is well known that to define the derived functors, say, of Tor, it is
sufficient to use flat resolutions.  The usual proofs of this fact use the
existence of projective resolutions to do this.  For example, to infer
functoriality, you use the possibility of lifting resolutions.  Suppose,
for example, you are in a category of modules over a sheaf of rings in a
topos.  Generally, there are no projectives (save 0), but the sheaves
associated to representable functors are flat.  More generally, suppose
that T: A --> C is a right exact functor between abelian categories.  Call
an object E T-effaceable if whenever 0 --> A --> B --> E -->0 is exact,
then TA --> TB is monic.  Assume as a hypothesis that the kernel of an
epimorphism between eeffaceables is effaceable and that every object is
the target of an epimorphism from an effaceable.  Then derived functors
are definable using effaceable resolutions.

was turned, the next year, into a international conference.  LACL'96 
and'97 have both been held in Nancy (France).  LACL'98 has been held 
in Grenoble (France).  Selected papers from LACL'95 appear in a special
issue of Journal of Logic Language and Information, 7(4), 1998.
The proceedings of LACL'96 and 97 appear as volumes 1328 and 1582
of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence.  The proceedings of LACL'98
are in press with the same series.


SCOPE

Typical topics include, but are not limited to:

   Categorial grammars, Categorial type logics, Compositionality, 
   Discourse representation theory, Dynamics, Feature Logics, 
   Formal language theory, Game-theoretical semantics, Grammatical 
   inference, Learning theory, Linear logical frameworks, Minimalism, 
   Modal logics, Montague semantics, Parsing as deduction, Proof-
   theoretic approaches, Situation semantics and situation theory,
   Type-theoretic approaches.


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Authors are invited to submit a full paper not exceeding 15 standard 
A4 or US quarto pages.  The paper should allow the Programme 
Committee to assess the merits of the work.  In particular, 
references and comparisons with related work should be included. 
Submission of material already published or submitted to other
conferences with published proceedings is not allowed.

Electronic submission is highly recommended.  A postscript version
of the paper should be sent as an e-mail to:

	Announcement and Call for Papers
                  MFPS XVII

         Seventeenth Conference on the
          Mathematical Foundations of
             Programming Semantics

              Aarhus University
               Aarhus, Denmark
            May 24 - May 27, 2001

Partially Supported by BRICS and the US Office of Naval Research

The Seventeenth Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics will take place on the campus of Aarhus
University in Aarhus, Denmark from May 24 to May 27, 2001. The MFPS
conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic and
computer science which are related to the semantics of programming
languages. The series particularly has stressed providing a forum
where both mathematicians and computer scientists can meet and
exchange ideas about problems of common interest. We also encourage
participation by researchers in neighboring areas, since we strive to
maintain breadth in the scope of the series.

The invited speakers for MFPS 17 include:
          Olivier Danvy  (Aarhus)
            Neil Jones  (DIKU)
            Kim Larsen  (Aalborg)
       Prakash Panangaden  (McGill)
            Jan Rutten  (CWI)
           Glynn Winskel  (Cambridge)

In addition to the invited talks, there will be three special
sessions.  The first will honor Neil Jones for his contributions to
theoretical computer science; it is being organized by Olivier Danvy
and David Schmidt (Kansas State).

The second will be a special session on model-checking, and it is
being organized by Rance Cleaveland (Stony Brook) and Kim Larsen.

The final special session will be on security, and it is being
organized by Catherine Meadows (NRL).

The remainder of the program will consist of papers selected from
submissions we receive in response to this Call for Papers.

The Organizing Committee for MFPS consists of Stephen Brookes (CMU),
Michael Main (Colorado), Austin Melton (Kent State University),
Michael Mislove (Tulane) and David Schmidt (Kansas State).  The
Co-chairs for MFPS XVII are Olivier Danvy, Michael Mislove and David
Schmidt.

The Program Committee Co-chairs for the meeting are Stephen Brookes
and Michael Mislove. The Program Committee also includes:
   Lars Birkedal (ITU)
   Rance Cleaveland (Stony Brook)
   Marcelo Fiore (Sussex)
   Matthew Hennessy (Sussex)
   Alan Jeffrey (DePaul)
   Achim Jung (Birmingham)
   Gavin Lowe (Oxford)
   Catherine Meadows (NRL)
   Peter O'Hearn (Queen Mary and Westfield)
   Susan Older (Syracuse)
   Dusko Pavlovic (Kestrel Institute)
   Uday Reddy (Birmingham)
   Giuseppe Rosolini (Genoa)
   Davide Sangiorgi (Inria - Sophia Antipolis)
   Andre Scedrov (Penn)
Submissions must be extended abstracts of 12 pages or less. They
should be in the form either of a PostScript file that can print on
any PostScript printer, or a pdf file. In particular, submissions
should use the US letter size format, as opposed to the European A4
size.

Submissions can be sent by email to mfps@math.tulane.edu 
The Deadline for Submissions is January 5, 2001

Information about decisions will be available by February 15, 2001, at
which time a list of accepted papers will be posted.

As with MFPS XI, MFPS XIII and MFPS XV, the Proceedings of the
conference will be published as a volume of the Electronic Notes in
Theoretical Computer Science. For information about this series,
access the URL http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs.

General inquiries about MFPS XVII can be addressed to
mfps@math.tulane.edu.

In addition to supporting the conference overall, the support provided
by the Office of Naval Research makes funds available to help offset
expenses of graduate students. Women and minorities also are
encouraged to inquire about possible support to attend the meeting.

               Registration Information
Detailed information about registration and accommodations will be
available on February 15, 2001, when the list of papers accepted for
the meeting is posted.

In brief:  If a structure has no nontrivial substructures, you can prove a
property P is true of everything in the structure by proving that the elements
with property P form a nonempty substructure.  Take the structure to be N with
the unary operation of successor and you get induction.  Now say that in the
opposite category:  If a structure has no nontrivial congruences, you can prove
that two objects are equal if they are equivalent under any congruence.  (You
can define "definition by coinduction" by a similar dualization.)  This has
found many applications in computer science (where the congruence is
bisimulation).  See J.J.M.M. Rutten, Universal coalgebra: a theory of systems.

The principle of induction says that initial algebras have no
non-trivial subalgebras.  Consider N, the initial successor algebra.
A subobject S of N is a subalgebra just in case there is a structure
map
s: S+1 -> S
such that the inclusion S -> N is a homomorphism.  This is just the
usual condition that 0 is in S and if n is in S, then so is its
successor.  Induction says that any such subalgebra exhausts the set
N.

Coinduction says, dually, that the final coalgebra has no non-trivial
quotients.  (To see that this is "really" a dual principle, we would
interpret "subalgebra" above as a regular subobject in the category of
algebras.)  However, the principle is usually stated in terms of
relations on a coalgebra, rather than quotients.  In these terms, the
principle of coinduction says: Any relation on <F,f> in the category
of coalgebras is a subrelation of equality.

Note: I stated the principles of induction/coinduction above for the
initial algebra/final coalgebra, resp.  However, just as induction
holds for any quotient of the initial algebra, coinduction holds for
any (regular) subcoalgebra of the final coalgebra.

I'm not sure what you're looking for in relation to NNOs.  An NNO is
the same as an initial algebra for the successor functor (assuming
that our category has coproducts).  The structure map N + 1 -> N is
given by [s,0], where s is the successor.  The final coalgebra for
successor is easily described (say, in Set):  It is the NNO with a
point adjoined for "infinity".  The structure map pred:F -> F + 1 fixes
infinity, takes n+1 to n and takes 0 to * (the element in 1 -- a kind
of "error condition").

As far as co-recursion goes, yes, there is a meaningful principle.
Namely, given any coalgebra <A,a>, there is a unique coalgebra
homomorphism from <A,a> to <F,f>.  Thus, for any set S together with a
function t:S -> S+1, there is a unique map h:S -> N u {infinity} such
that 
(1) if t(s) = *, then h(s) = 0
(2) else, h(t(s)) = h(s) - 1 (where infinity - 1 = infinity)
In other words, h here takes an element s to the least n such that
t^n(s) = *, if defined.  If, for all n, t^n(s) != *, then h(s) =
infinity.

I'll defer on the question of what the appropriate internal language
is.

As far as how coinduction is used to prove theorems: To show two
elements of the final coalgebra are equal, it suffices to find a
coalgebraic relation relating the elements.

Hendrik's suggestion (that you find Jacobs and Rutten's paper) is a
good one, but I hope these comments help until then.

Dear GT and AGT Subscribers

The attached letter is being widely mailed to topologists.  It
announces the launching of a new journal (Algebraic and Geometric
Topology) published by Geometry and Topology Publications.  Please
help to publicise this journal by circulating the letter as widely as
possible.

The letter is given as a text file, as a LaTeX file and as a
PostScript file:

Fellow Topologists:

This letter announces the launching of a new international journal,
"Algebraic & Geometric Topology" (AGT). It is intended that this new
journal cover all of topology, broadly defined. Papers will be fully
refereed,  in the traditional manner and using standards which are
well-known in our field. Immediately after they are accepted for
publication, they will be published electronically. At the end of each
calendar year, that year's papers will be published in a paper volume,
which will be sold to the libraries at cost.  AGT is an ``independent
journal", i.e. a journal established by and run by mathematicians, with
the cooperation of commercial publishers who will handle the printing and
distribution of the paper version. 

The range of interests of AGT is defined by its Editorial
Board. It has two Editors-in-Chief, Bob Oliver for Algebraic Topology
and Marty Scharlemann for Geometric Topology.  The other members of the
Editorial Board are Selman Akbulut, Joan Birman, Ruth Charney, Fred Cohen,
Alexander Dranishnikov, John Etnyre, Mario Eudave-Mu\~noz, David Fried,
John Greenlees, Ian Hambleton, Hans-Werner Henn, Kathryn Hess, Stefan
Jackowski, Akio Kawauchi, Goro Nishida, Tomotada Ohtsuki, Fr\'ed\'eric
Paulin, Andrew Ranicki, Justin Roberts, Michah Sageev, Peter Scott, Ulrike
Tillmann, Vladimir Turaev, Shicheng Wang.   The Managing Editors (in
charge of publishing) are Colin Rourke and Brian Sanderson.  Manuscripts
may be submitted to any Editor, including the Editors-in-Chief (but not
the Managing Editors).  For details about the
mathematical interests of the members of the Editorial Board and for
instructions on the submission of manuscripts, visit our web site at 

		http://www.maths.warwick.ac.uk/agt/ 

As most of you probably know, the underlying reason for independent
journals  is that most of the commercial journals specializing in topology
have priced themselves beyond the reach of our libraries. AGT intends to
compete directly for the stronger papers in Topology and Its Applications,
K-Theory, Geometria Dedicata, Topology  and The Journal of Knot Theory and
its Ramifications. The 1999 prices for those journals range between $.45
and $.92/page, plus varying supplements (which are difficult to pin down
because they depend upon complex arrangements) for the electronic
version. On the other hand, we anticipate that AGT will cost about
$.10/page for the printed version and zero for the electronic version. The
issue of journal prices was the main reason for the founding of GTP, a
non-profit making publication enterprise specializing in electronic
publications. It is based in the Mathematics Department of the University
of Warwick at Coventry, UK, and it will publish the electronic versions of
Algebraic & Geometric Topology and its sister journal Geometry & Topology. 

This raises the immediate question: how is the new journal Algebraic &
Geometric Topology} related to the existing journal Geometry
& Topology? They are distinct competing journals owned by the same parent
organization, just as {\it Springer-Verlag} publishes competing graduate
textbooks in topology.  Each has its own editorial board. The mathematical
interests and tastes of the board members naturally shape the
journal.  These interests have some overlap, and many areas of
non-overlap.   Algebraic & Geometric Topology aims to be more inclusive
than Geometry & Topology, and it intends to concentrate more specifically
on topology. It will set its own standards as it evolves, with those
standards determined in part by the competing journals which we named
explicitly above. For many years topologists have had a choice of
commercial journals. Now they will also have a choice among independent
journals. 

Endorsement by SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources
Coalition) has been requested and is pending. If we receive it, we
anticipate that subscriptions to the paper version will come in from a
broad selection of research libraries. Negotiations with publishers
for printing the paper version are underway. We anticipate
that they will be completed well before we have enough papers for our
first volume.  Archiving will be handled through the arXiv (at either
arXiv.org or xxx.lanl.gov), a free service which appears to us to be
sound and reliable. Note that we use the arXiv solely as an extra layer of
security (in case for some unknown reason the files stored electronically
at Warwick University are lost). The papers which are stored in the arXiv
will carry the AGT logo and will say, very clearly, ``Published in
Algebraic & Geometric Topology". They therefore cannot be confused with
preprints.

We solicit your submissions, and your assistance in encouraging your
library to provide convenient browsing access to AGT. We
hope that you will find this new journal as exciting as we do, and will
express that feeling by sending us your papers, contributing your
expertise as a referee when we call on you, and by telling your students
and colleagues about AGT. 

Sincerely,

Bob Oliver, Marty Scharlemann (for the Editorial Board of AGT)
and Joan Birman, John Jones, Rob Kirby,  Haynes Miller, Colin Rourke,
Brian Sanderson (Executive Committee of GTP)

Al Vilcius asks:

and most people reply along the lines of:

but wouldn't it be nice to keep the standard definition of
induction, which says that the equations

    f(0) = c
    f(n+1) = g(f(n))

determine a unique f, given c and g? this is the definition that
most first year students study, and many programmers use every
day, usually without the slightest idea about subalgebras, or
triviality. do we really gain anything by replacing this simple
scheme by the higher-order statement about all subalgebras? ok,
we do get the appearance of symmetry between induction and
coinduction. but is the higher-order statement about quotients
really the friendliest form of coinduction, suitable to be taken
as the definition?

i think barwise and moss somewhere describe coinduction as
*induction without the base case*. the coinduction principle
says that the equation

    X = a.X + bc.X

determines a unique CCS-process, or a unique {a,b,c}-labelled
hyperset. it also guarantees that the integral equation

    E(x) = 1 + \int_0^x E dt

has a unique solution. (note that this is equivalent to the
differential equation

    E(0) = 1
    E = E'

where the initial condition gives the base case for the power
series solution. so the no-base-case slogan is just a matter of
form? but note that  E' = E, and more generally E' = h(E), for
an analytic h, identifies two *infinite* streams, and is not a
mere inductive step up the stream.)

in any case, i contend that the practice of coinduction
primarily consists of solving *guarded equations*, like the two
above --- surely if you count the areas where people extensively
use coinduction, without calling it by name, viz math analysis.

((it is true that computer scientists became aware of
coinduction while working out the bisimulations etc, which is
why the quotients came in light. but now it seems that the
bisimulations were just the way to construct final coalgebras;
whereas the coinduction, in analogy with the induction, should
be a practically useful logical principle, available over the
*given* final coalgebras.))

anyway, the heart of the matter probably lies in peter aczel's
insight that the statement

     * V ---> PV is a final coalgebra for P = (finite) powerset
functor

equivalently means that

    * every accessible pointed graph has a unique decoration in
V.

presenting the graph definitions as systems of guarded equations
(like in barwise and moss' book "vicious circles"), the above
equivalence generalizes to the statement that

    * V --d--> FV is a final coalgebra for F

iff

    * every system of guarded equations over V has a unique
solution.

where the notion of guarded is determined by F and d. this is,
of course, just barwise and moss' solution lemma, lifted to F.
or more succinctly : **V is a final fixpoint iff each guarded
operation g:V-->V has a unique fixpoint**

this, of course, supports the view that ***coinduction is
solving guarded equations***...

i was hoping to say more, but will have to leave it for later,
and post this hoping to motivate discussion.

unguardedly yours,
-- dusko pavlovic

PS i have a great appreciation for jan rutten's work on
coinduction, but it seems to me that the title of *universal
coalgebra* is a bit exaggerated. universal algebra does not
dualize. by design, it is meant to be model theory of algebraic
theories. what would be the "coalgebraic theories", leading to
coalgebras as their models? what would their functorial
semantics look like?  (implicitly, these questions are already
in manes' book.)

and then, moving from coalgebraic theories to comonads, like
from algebraic theories to monads, should presumably yield an
HSP-like characterization for the categories of (comonad)
coalgebras. but coalgebras for a comonad over a topos usually
form just another topos.

i may be missing something essential here, but then i do stand
to be corrected.

I'm afraid that I've never quite understood the notion of guarded
equations, so I cannot comment on much of what you wrote below without
some more time and more thought.  Let me make a few introductory
comments and perhaps I can say more later.

I have always considered the statement regarding existence of a unique
function f to be the principle of recursion.  The principle of
induction is, in my mind, the weaker principle that says that if a
property holds of 0 and is closed under successor, then it holds of N.
I identify "properties" with subobjects here.  In terms of
homomorphisms, this is equivalent to the "uniqueness part" of
initiality (assuming that our category has some epi-mono factorization
property, I suppose).

One may question whether it's appropriate to take the principle of
induction to apply to all properties or only those properties which
are definable in some sense -- I guess you've done as much when you
refer to the "higher-order statement" above.  I'm not sure to what
extent my use of all subalgebras differs from your quantification over
all g and c in the statement of recursion above, however.

When we separate the properties of induction and recursion in the way
I mention above, by the way, then (conceptually) induction is a
property of those algebras A in which each element is picked out by a
(not necessarily unique) term of our language.  I.e., those A for
which there is an epi from the initial algebra to A.  Hence, induction
in my sense is weaker than recursion (induction in your sense).

Regarding whether a statement about quotients is really the
"friendliest form" of coinduction, I'll have to agree that it is not,
if one's aim is to describe coinduction as it is commonly used.  I
chose to describe it in the terms above because these terms make clear
the "co" in "coinduction".

I did gloss over details that ensure the equivalence of the "familiar
principle" of coinduction and the principle regarding quotients.  If
the base category has kernel pairs of coequalizers and G preserves
weak pullbacks, then a G-coalgebra A has no non-trivial quotients iff the
equality relation is the largest coalgebraic relation on A (I hope
I've got that right).  Inasmuch as the principle I called coinduction
is not always equivalent to the familiar principle, I was being a bit
misleading.  However, I think it is the right approach if one's goal
is to explain the relationship between induction and coinduction.

I'm not sure that the principle regarding the equality relation is
what you'd call coinduction, however.  I think that the principle you
have in mind is what I'd call "corecursion".  Analogous to the
distinction between recursion and induction, I omit the existence part
of finality in what I call "coinduction" and I use the uniqueness
part.

But, there *are* such characterizations of categories of coalgebras,
if I understand your point.  Namely, a full subcategory of coalgebras
is closed under coproducts, codomains of epis and domains of regular
monos iff it is the class of coalgebras satisfying a "coequation" --
given, here, some boundedness conditions on the functor so that things
work out well.  For brevity's sake, and because you're likely familiar
with this result, I'll omit details on what a coequation is and how
it's satisfied.

By the way, about that last statement regarding coalgebras "usually"
forming a topos:  Doesn't one need that the endofunctor preserve
pullbacks, or am I missing something?

Hi all,

although I cannot say much on coinduction itself, I would like to mention
one possible point of view on "universal coalgebra" commented on by Dusko at
the end of his message:

I would say that, although there is no straightforward dualization, there
might be a "hidden" one. In my opinion, comonads can sometimes play the role
of "strengtheners" or "enrichers" for monads, so that while monads can be
viewed as a "substrate for structure", comonads are "substrate for
semantics".

Rather than trying to give sense to this vague phrase, let me give three
illustrations.

-1-
S. Kobayashi,
Monad as modality.
Theoret. Comput. Sci. 175 (1997), no. 1, 29--74.

The starting point in that paper is the monad semantics by Moggi.
It seems that for computer-scientific purposes strength of the monad is too
restrictive a requirement, and the author modifies the semantics by assuming
strength of the monad *only*with* respect*to*a*comonad*. This means that the
monad and comonad distribute in such a way that the monad descends to a
strong monad on the category of coalgebras over the comonad. Under the
Curry-Howard correspondence this yields an interesting intuitionistic
version of the modal system S4. A realizability interpretation is also
given.

-2-
Freyd, Yetter, Lawvere, Kock, Reyes and others have studied "atoms", or
infinitesimal objects - objects I in a cartesian closed category with the
property that the exponentiation functor I->(_) has a right adjoint. This
induces a monad, which cannot be strong in a nontrivial way, just as in the
previous example. There is a "largest possible" subcategory over which it is
strong, namely the category of I-discrete objects, i.e. those objects X for
which the adjunction unit from X to I->X is iso. In good cases the inclusion
of this subcategory is comonadic. As Bill pointed out, one might view
Cantor's idea of set theory as a case of this: the universe of sets is the
largest - necessarily "discrete" - part of "analysis" over which the latter
can be "enriched" (well, this is awfully inaccurate, sorry -- consider it as
a metaphor).

-3-
In differential homotopical algebra, there was developed a notion of torsor
(principal homogeneous object) which works in a non-cartesian monoidal
category. This notion requires not just a (right) action of a monoid M on an
object P, but also a "cartesianizer" in form of a left coaction of a
comonoid C on P which commutes with the action, and is principal in an
appropriate sense. It turns out that the monoid and the comonoid enter in an
entirely symmetric way. In the monoidal category of differential graded
modules over a commutative ring, principal C-M-objects are classified by
s.c. twisting cochains from C to M. Moreover in that category, for a monoid
M there is a universal choice of P and C given by the Eilenberg-Mac Lane bar
construction, and for a comonoid C there is a universal choice of P and M,
given by the Adams' cobar construction. I would be grateful for a reference
to a version of these for general monads/comonads.

Regards,
Mamuka

1.  Is there a variety embedding coinduction?

Jesse Hughes distinguishes induction from recursion in terms of natural
numbers.  For him induction is Peano's mathematical induction, while
recursion is the uniqueness of the map from the (unique up to a unique
isomorphism) initial algebra to an arbitrary algebra.

To me induction is on the one hand a slightly more general notion, yet on
the other sufficiently tractable that it can be axiomatized equationally
when suitably expressed, as I'll now describe.  In particular there
exists a variety embedding induction, meaning one in which an induction
principle holds.  Whether the additional generality makes induction
equal to recursion is another story.

The context in which all this arose, namely answers to Al Vilcius'
question about coinduction, naturally prompts the question, is there a
variety embedding coinduction, to which I'll return at the end.

2.  Nature of Induction

Suppose, somewhere out there in the universe, a world exists where
kicking a nonworking TV set always leaves it in its nonworking state.
Then in that world (certainly not ours), it is surely the case that
repeated kicking can do no better.

The general principle here is that if performing a certain action on
a system cannot under any circumstance destroy a certain property of
that system, then neither can _repeatedly_ performing that action on
that system.

I submit that this is the essence of induction, of which mathematical
induction is just an instance.

This principle may be expressed more logically as

        PQ  |- P
        -------            (IND)
        PQ* |- P

The premise is that Q preserves P.  That is, if first P and then
afterwards Q, it follows that P.

The conclusion is that Q* preserves P.  That is, if first P and then
afterwards Q repeatedly, it follows that P.  Here we understand Q*
as the reflexive transitive closure of Q, in the spirit of Kleene's
regular expressions, which we take to denote the performance of Q zero
or more times.

By itself (IND) serves only to bound Q* from above, which would allow
us to satisfy (IND) with Q* = 0 for all Q.  We may bound Q* from below
by adding that Q* is a closure of Q, namely Q <= Q*, and is transitive
--- Q*Q* <= Q* --- and reflexive --- 1 <= Q*.  These additional
conditions make Q* the least reflexive transitive element greater or
equal to Q (proved below), thereby uniquely determining it.

3.  Equational Expression of Induction

The earliest description to my knowledge of a finitely based variety
embedding an induction principle is Tarski and Ng's RAT [1] (1977).
(The second is DALG, dynamic algebras, which I described two years later
[2] (1979), independently of [1], which I did not learn about until 1989.)
The following, based on [3] (1990), generalizes the Boolean setting for
RAT to residuated semirings.  Others who have worked on finitely based
varieties embedding induction include Kozen, Bloom, and Esik, to name
just a few.

Take as the ambient variety that of semirings with unit.  The signature
is 2-2-0-0, notated (X, ., +, 0, 1).  The equations are:

1.  (X,+,0) is a semilattice with unit: + is associative (1), commutative
(2), and idempotent (3), with identity 0 (4).

2.  (X,.,1) is a monoid:  . is associative (5), with identity 1 (6,7).

3.  Distributivity:
        x.(y+z) = x.y + x.y              (8)
        (x+y).z = x.z + y.z              (9)

(Distributivity could be weakened to monotonicity for our purposes,
but since (RR) and (LR) below force it anyway we may as well put it in
here to justify calling this a semiring.)

We make the following abbreviations.

        xy for x.y
        x <= y for x+y = y (inequations are expressible equationally)
        x |- y for x <= y (i.e. for x+y = y), to look more logical

The induction principle IND may then be understood as being about such
a semiring expanded with a unary operation *.

Thus far the signature has constants 0 and 1, binary operations + and
., and a unary operation *, amounting to Kleene's language of regular
expressions.  The addition of two further binary operations, suitably
axiomatized equationally, permits a purely equational expression of
the foregoing.

The desired language expansion adds right and left residuation, x\y and
x/y (of which just the first suffices for our immediate purposes).

              PQ <= R iff Q <= P\R (right residuation)     (RR)
                      iff P <= R/Q (left residuation)      (LR)

These axioms, recognizable in this forum of course as making P\ and
/P the polarities of a Galois connection or posetal adjunction, serve
to define P\Q and Q/P uniquely in terms of the semiring operations.
In particular they force P\Q (resp. Q/P) to be the greatest, i.e. weakest,
element satisfying P(P\Q) <= Q (resp. (Q/P)P <= Q).

If we interpret PQ logically as a noncommutative conjunction P _then_ Q,
then P\Q, or P -> Q, may be understood logically as "if previously P, then R".
Similarly Q/P, or Q <- P, becomes "Q provided eventually P".  One way of
looking at this is that we are furnishing the signature with internal
conditionals in order to express the external conditionals in (IND),
(RR), and (LR) purely equationally.

(RR) and (LR) serve not merely to axiomatize residuation but to define
it, in the sense that for any given semiring there exists at most one
interpretation of right residuation satisfying (RR).  Hence (RR) serves
(a) to pick out those semirings having exactly one such interpretation,
and (b) to enforce that interpretation.  Similarly for (LR).

The nonequational definition of residuation given by (RR) and (LR)
has the following equipollent equational expression (exercise):

        P\(Q+R) = P\Q + P\R               (10)
        P(P\Q) <= Q <= P\(PQ)             (11)
        (P+Q)/R = P/R + Q/R               (12)
        (Q/P)P <= Q <= (QP)/P             (13)

(Actually (10) and (12) are overkill, it suffices to state that P\Q
and Q/P are monotone in Q, viz. P\Q <= P\(Q+R) and similarly for Q/P.
Also left residuation along with (LR), (12), and (13) are redundant for
the purposes of the present story.)

Three more equations complete the promised variety.

        1 + P*P* + P <= P*                (14)
        P* <= (P+Q)*                      (15)
        (P\P)* <= P\P                     (16) (induction, equationally) [1]

Equation (14) says that P* is a reflexive transitive element greater or
equal to P.

Equation (15) merely asserts the monotonicity of *.

Equation (16) is the equational expression of induction.  It is
equivalent to

        P(P\P)* <= P                      (16')

That is, the repeated action of P\P preserves P.

The interest in P\P is first of all that it preserves P, i.e.

        P(P\P) <= P

as an immediate consequence (by (RR)) of P\P <= P\P; and second that
it is the weakest (greatest) preserver of P, since if PQ <= P then
Q <= P\P (by (RR)).

This makes (16') the instance of induction in which the preserver of P
happens to be P\P.

But since P\P is the _weakest_ preserver of P, we can now obtain the
general (nonequational) induction principle, namely from PQ <= P infer
PQ* <= P, from this specific equationally expressible instance of it, viz.

        PQ  <= P
        Q   <= P\P          by (RR)
        Q*  <= (P\P)*       by (15) (monotonicity of *)
        PQ* <= P(P\P)*      by (9) (additivity of P. implies its monotonicity)
            <= P            by (16')

That is, the induction principle (IND) holds in the variety axiomatized by
(1)-(16).

More than this however, the unary operation * is uniquely determined
by (14)-(16) by virtue of P* being the least (hence unique) reflexive
transitive element of the semiring greater or equal to P.  To see this,
consider any reflexive transitive X.  By transitivity XX <= X so X <=
X\X, whence X* <= (X\X)* <= X\X.  Hence XX* <= X.  Concatenating X* on the
right of each side of 1 <= X yields X* <= XX* <= X.  Now suppose P <= X.
Then P* <= X* <= X, making P* the least reflexive transitive element >= P.

The residuals are of course uniquely determined by (10)-(13).  So any
semiring can be expanded with residuation and star so as to satisfy
(10)-(16) in at most one way.  That is, those seven equations not only
single out those semirings admitting such an expansion but serve to fully
define pre- and post-implication as well as reflexive transitive closure,
entirely in terms of the given semiring.

Given the well-known difficulties of defining the natural numbers using
Peano's mathematical induction, or by any other first order means, it is
a pleasant change to see an ostensibly intractable operation such as P*
pinned down exactly in this way, and even more pleasant that it is all
done purely equationally.

4.  Back to the question

We may now reword the original question in the light of the foregoing.

To what variety can one similarly associate suitable operations fully
defined equationally so as to include an equationally expressed principal
of coinduction?

This doesn't look like what I had in mind, exactly.  Peano's
mathematical induction was meant as an example of induction, not the
whole meaning of induction.  I stated induction in terms of natural
numbers only to continue Dusko's example.  I'm afraid that I was a bit
vague in what exactly induction is in my previous post.

I say that a G-algebra A satisfies the principle of induction just in
case every mono G-homomorphism into A is an isomorphism.  If our base
category has equalizers, then A satisfies the principle of induction
just in case, for every algebra B, there is at most one homomorphism 
A -> B.  So induction is the uniqueness part of initiality.

What's recursion, then?  As far as I'm concerned, recursion is just
initiality.  I.e., an algebra A satisfies the principle of definition
by recursion just in case it is the initial algebra.  (Why not take
recursion to be just the existence part?  I haven't seen much use for
just the existence part and it also doesn't fit well with conventional
usage.)  Clearly, on this view, the principle of recursion implies the
principle of induction, but the converse is not the case.

I hope that my idea of induction is a bit clearer.  I really must
learn to write more precisely.

> can anyone explain coinduction?
> in what sense it dual to induction?

We've heard some very erudite answers to these questions. I
don't know the questioner's background, but here is a
different answer, in case it helps.

In the algebraic approach to functional programming, an
initial datatype of a functor F is a datatype T and an
operation in : F T -> T for which the equation in h

  h . in = f . F h

has a unique solution for given f. We write "fold_F f" for
that unique solution, so

  h = fold_F f  <=>  h . in = f . F h

This is an inductive definition of fold, and the above
equivalence (the "universal property for fold") encapsulates
proof by structural induction.

(For example, when F X = 1+X, then T is N, the naturals. The
injection in : 1+N->N is the coproduct morphism [0,1+].
Folds on naturals are functions of the form

  fold_{1+} [z,s] 0     = z
  fold_{1+} [z,s] (1+n) = s (fold_{1+} [z,s] n)

To prove that a predicate p holds for every natural n is
equivalent to proving that the function p : N -> Bool is
equal to the function alwaystrue : N -> Bool that always
returns true. Now alwaystrue is a fold,

  alwaystrue = fold_{1+} [true,step]
    where step true = true

Therefore, to prove that p holds for every natural, we can
use the universal property:

      predicate p holds of every natural
  <=>
      p = alwaystrue
  <=>
      p = fold_{1+} [true,step]
  <=>
      p . [0,1+] = [true,step] . id+p
  <=>
      p(0) = true  and  p(1+n) = step(p(n))
  <=>
      p(0) = true  and  (p(1+n) = true when p(n) = true)

which is the usual principle of mathematical induction.)

Dually, a final datatype of a functor F is a datatype T and
an operation out : T -> F T for which the equation in h

  out . h = F h . f

has a unique solution for given f. We write "unfold_F f" for
that unique solution, so

  h = unfold_F f  <=>  out . h = F h . f

This is a coinductive definition of unfold, and the above
equivalence (the "universal property for unfold")
encapsulates proof by structural coinduction.

> how is it used to prove theorems?

Exactly the same way. For example, the datatype Stream A of
streams of A's is the final datatype of the functor taking X
to A x X. An example of an unfold for this type is the
function iterate, for which

  iterate f x = [ x, f x, f (f x), f (f (f x)), ... ]

defined by

  iterate f = unfold_{A x} <id,f>

One might expect that

  iterate f . f = Stream f . iterate f

and the proof of this fact is a straightforward application
of the universal property of unfold (that is, a proof by
coinduction).

I believe the original post asked what coalgebras might be good for.
Dusko Pavlovic already talked about examples of coinduction in
analysis. Let me mention two examples from constructive mathematics.
They are both examples of final coalgebras for polynomial functors.

A polynomial functor P_f with signature f: B --> A is a functor of the
form

   P_f(X) = \sum_{a \in A} X^{f^{*} a}

where \sum is a dependent sum, and f^{*} is the inverse image of f.
For the purposes of this post you can think of a polynomial functor as 
one of the form

   P(X) = C_0 + C_1 x X^{N_1} + ... + C_k x X^{N_k}

where C_0, ..., C_k and N_0, ..., N_k are (constant) objects.

Suppose we are in a constructive setting (a variant of Martin-Lof type
theory, effective topos, a PER model, ...) in which every polynomial
functor has a final coalgebra.



Example 1:

In constructive mathematics _spreads_ and _fans_ play an important
role. They are examples of final coalgebras. For example, a fan is a
finitely branching tree (can be infinite!) in which the nodes are
labeled with natural numbers. The space of all fans FAN satisfies the
identity

  FAN = N + N x FAN + N x FAN^2 + N x FAN^3 + ...
      = sum_{k \in N} N x FAN^k

it is the final coalgebra for the polynomial functor

  P(X) = \sum_{k \in N} N x FAN^k

I find this presentation conceptually cleaner than the usual encoding
of spreads as sets of Goedel codes of finite sequences of natural
numbers (of course, this presentation requires a richer type theory).
Also, this definition is easily adapted to fans and spreads labeled by
elements of any set A (just replace N x FAN^k with A x FAN^k), and of
any branching type.

By the way, FAN is isomorphic to N^N, and N^N is the final coalgebra
for the functor P(X) = N x X.


Example 2:

The initial algebra for P(X) = 1 + X is the set of natural numbers.

The final coalgebra N^+ for this functor is best thought of as the
one-point compactification of the natural numbers, as it consists of
the natural numbers together with one extra point "at infinity". In
classical set theory, this is no different from natural numbers, but
in a constructive setting the point at infinity is not isolated. If
one wants to prove anything interesting about N^+, just about the only
way to do it is to use coinduction and corecursion. It's a good
exercise.

This is neat because we get a one-point compactification of N without
any reference to topology.

If we compute N^+ in PER(D), where D is some topological model of the
untyped lambda calculus, such as P(omega) or the universal Scott
domain, we get _precisely_ the one-point compactification of natural
numbers.

In the effective topos N^+ can be described as an equivalence relation
on partial recursive functions, where two such functions are
equivalent if, and only if, they terminate in the same number of steps
(when applied to some fixed input) or they diverge. The divergent
functions represent the point at infinity, and those terminating in
exactly k steps represent the number k.

the recursion schema, as defined by godel in 1930, is a bit  stronger: g is
allowed to depend on n, not only on f(n).

in a topos, this principle is equivalent with the above schema. and the
schema itself, of course, just means that [0,s] : 1+N --> N is initial: any
algebra [c,g] : 1+X --> X induces a unique homomorphism f : N-->X. using the
exponents, we do recursion.

as i said last time, induction and recursion have been in heavy use for so
long, that they really don't leave much space for redefining, even for the
sake of symmetry with coinduction and corecursion.

This is to announce that a pre-print is available at
http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/user/jesse/papers/CoBirkhoff.ps.gz.
Dusko's recent post regarding coinduction raises a question that is
answered in this paper.  Namely, what is the dual to Birkhoff's HSP
theorem?

Title: The Coalgebraic Dual of Birkhoff's Variety Theorem
Authors: Steve Awodey and Jesse Hughes
Abstract: 

   We prove an abstract dual of Birkhoff's variety theorem for
   categories $\E_\Gamma$ of coalgebras, given suitable assumptions on
   the underlying category $\E$ and suitable $\map\Gamma\E\E$.  We
   also discuss covarieties closed under bisimulations and show that
   they are definable by a trivial kind of coequation -- namely, over
   one ``color''.  We end with an example of a covariety which is
   \emph{not} closed under bisimulations.

   This research is part of the Logic of Types and Computation project
   (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/LTC/) at Carnegie Mellon University
   under the direction of Dana Scott.

Yes, I overlooked that point. But, is that principle any stronger than
the principle you called induction?  I think it isn't, given products
in our category.  

Let N be the initial successor algebra.  Let c be in X and 
g:N x X -> X. To define a function f such that
f(0) = c
f(n+1) = g(n,f(n)),
I just have to cook up the appropriate structure map for N x X.  I
think that
<s o p_1,g> + <0,c>: (N x X) + 1 -> N x X
does it (p_1 is the projection map).  Let <k,f>: N -> N x X be the
unique function guaranteed by initiality.  One can show that f
satisfies the equations above.  (Along the way, one shows that k is
the identity.)

(To add other parameters, one needs exponentials.  For instance,
given
h:A -> X
g:A x N x X -> X
to show that there is a unique f such that
f(a,0) = h(a)
f(a,n+1) = g(a,n,f(a,n))
requires a structure map for (X x N)^A, if I'm not mistaken.)

This shows that Godel's principle of recursion is equivalent to the
statement "N is an initial algebra".  I.e., it is equivalent to the
statement that there is a unique f such that
f(0) = c
f(n+1) = g(f(n)).

I am confused by this statement.  My principle of induction for
successor algebras [0_X,s_X]:1+X -> X is this: For all subsets P of X,
if 0_X is in P and P is closed under s_X, then P = X.  (Categorically,
an algebra satisfies the principle of induction if it contains no
proper subalgebras.)

Consider the successor algebra X={x}, with the evident structure map 
[0_X,s_X]:1+X -> X.  
Surely, for every subset P of X, if 0_X is in P and P is closed under
s_X, then P = X.  In other words, the algebra X satisfies the principle
of induction in the sense that I gave.  This seems to contradict the
equivalence you mention.  What am I overlooking?

I quite agree, but I didn't redefine induction, as far as I am
concerned.  I learned that induction was the proof principle as I
stated it and that recursion is the principle regarding the definition
of functions many years ago.  I think that our disagreement in
definitions is a disagreement that one will find elsewhere in the
literature.  I also suppose that the term coinduction (as I use it)
arose from the definition of induction that I offered.

Are others unfamiliar with the distinction between induction and
recursion as I drew it?  I assumed it was a more or less conventional
distinction.  If my use is really idiosyncratic, then I'd be happy to
drop it.

hi.

almost a year after peter freyd posted his version of the coalgebra of
real numbers (henceforth coreals), i finally tried to cash in on my
initial excitement with it, and spec out the coinductive programs for
addition and multiplication. however, i must report that i am a bit stuck.
since i am also guilty of not having tried to work this out in time, i'll
try to refresh things (at least for myself) by reporting in some detail.

the reason why i was excited, as i think i explained at the time, was that
peter seemed to be able to define the algebraic operations on his coreals
by a relatively simple *stream* coinduction. for the coreals vaughan pratt
and i had previously constructed, i only knew how to do this using the
*conway games*, ie cuts, which appeared to be the most inefficient way
imaginable.

let me clarify the context a little, and why any of this matters. first of
all, why another presentation of reals, when there are already so many
deep and beautiful presentations, left behind the centuries of analysis?
well, in spite of all that math, the CS students still learn that real
numbers must be truncated, because they are infinite, whereas the
computers are finite. as if computers are more finite than our heads, or
smaller than our calculus textbooks. so the task is to find a presentation
of the "real reals" suitable for computers. and the hypothesis is that
coinduction allows such presentations. and indeed, we have several
different coinductive implementations of the datatype of reals, and it has
also been shown that a lot of what people do in differential calculus
yields to coinduction.

but the problem is that coalgebraically implemented reals offer some
resistance to algebra: adding and multiplying computable reals may not be
computable. if each real number is represented irredundantly, say by a
unique stream of digits, then there will be numbers for which the entire
infinite streams of digits will need to be consumed before the first digit
of their sum, or product, can be determined. this observation is due to
brouwer, and has been mentioned in this thread several times, in one form
or another.

in any case, in order to implement coreal algebra, besides a
real coalgebra R, we also need a *redundant numeration system*,
a surjection

    D^N --->> R

mapping to each number the streams of D-digits representing it
(plus some structure saying this).

the coalgebras vaughan and i had constructed represent each number by a
unique stream, and didn't seem to have good numeration systems. (now i
think at least two of them have decent *generalized* numerations --- later
more.)

in contrast, peter's coalgebra represented reals as equivalence
classes of streams, and thus came equipped with natural
numerations! true, they were never mentioned explicitly,
probably because XvX was viewed as a subobject of XxX, in order
to allow splitting X--->XvX as a pair <d,u>. but viewing XvX as
the quotient of X+X = 2xX displays the final coalgebra I of XvX
as the quotient of the final coalgebra 2^N of 2xX. hence the
numeration

    2^N --->> I

corresponding to the standard binary expansion. of course, this
system is not fully redundant (i think andrej bauer pointed this

out), but the transition to the signed binary expansion

    3^N --->> I

where 3 = {-1,0,1}, is almost as well known... (ok, i only
learned of it from martin escardo's thesis, but the real
aritmeticists surely know all about it.)

in any case, it seemed reasonable to expect that freyd's elegant

derivations lift to the redundant numerations, viz the streams
lurking at the intuitive background of all constructions.

and indeed, the midpoint operation lifts to a coinductive
definition on 3^N. but nothing beyond that point works for me.
in particular, i don't know how to construct from the closed
interval *with a numeration system* a *coalgebra* of all reals,
*with the corresponding numeration*. neither of the reflection
of midpoint algebras in abelian groups, nor the extension of the
"yoneda" embedding of the interval in its endomorphism monoid
extends to the numeration systems. how do you enrich the
structure of abelian group by a numeration system? what should
the midpoint algebra homomorphisms lift on the attached
numerations?

the alternative that i keep pushing are the conway coreals.

the finite and infinite lists of 1 and -1 yield an irredundant
representation of the real line, extended with the infinity on
both ends. to get the real number corresponding to a list, sum
up the initial 1s or -1s, until the sign changes. this is the
integer part of the number. after that point, sum up the entries
of the list divided by increasing powers of 2. this is, of
course, gonshor's version of surreal numbers.

it is a retract of the conway's version. but conway's games can
be viewed as {L,R}-labelled hypersets. so they form a final
coalgebra. the addition, and the multiplication arise as
*eminently* coinductive operations. the addition happens to be
defined by a coalgebra similar to the one defining the product
of analytic functions, and the asynchronous product of
processes. conway's definitions of all algebraic operations are
very nice examples of coinductive programming.

the idea is now to use gonshor's version as the real coalgebra,
and conway's version as a generalized numeration system: instead
of streams of digits, use {L,R}-labelled graphs, viz hypersets.
gonshor's numbers correspond to the minimal representatives of
conway's numbers, so they embed canonically; whereas conway's
*simplicity theorem* yields the retraction.

in practice, given two real numbers, say to add, and the desired
precision of the result, you replace them by sufficiently small
binary intervals, ie the simplest binary numbers contained.
these lift to finite conway games, and easily add. finding the
simplest form is trivial. i am not sure whether i am missing
something, but with this approximation part, the algorithm does
not seem inefficient at all any more.

originally, this story was invented for the coalgebra of
alternating dyadics, which has appeared in my paper with vaughan
pratt. but alternating dyadics are easily seen to be just a
version of gonshor's representation. and just like alternating
dyadics/gonshor reals embed in conway's games, our coalgebra of
continued fractions embeds in contorted fractions, mentioned by
peter johnstone... one would expect that that numeration system
might be still a bit more efficient, or less inefficient, though
i didn't look at the details at all...

happy halloween,
