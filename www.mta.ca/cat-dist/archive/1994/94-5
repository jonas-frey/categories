Subject: translation traps

From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

The exchange over that Latin illustrates  very clearly the danger of
relying on cognates when translating.  Had someone been translating
from Latin to,  say Swahili,  and translated  mathematicae to whatever
the Swahili word is for mathematics, he would have to be considered to
have made an error in translation.  I am reminded of a rather odd
mistranslation in the English translation of GAuss' Disquisitiones
in which Gauss is said to have claimed that previous mathematicians 
have proved it (quadratic reciprocity, no less) by induction but he
(Gauss) was giving the first demonstration by infinite descent.
Of course, it was a mistranslation to translate probare by prove and
inductio by induction (although that is partly because mathematical
induction is a rather specialized use of the word even in English).
Of course, Gauss was claiming that others had tried it on a lot of
numbers, while he was giving the first correct proof, by that
form of mathematical induction called infinite descent.

Subject: Confused about Cartesian closed categories.

Date: Tue, 03 May 94 15:21:32 +0100
From: Justin K Pearson <jkp@ukc.ac.uk>

This is all very simple stuff, which I should have worked out a long time ago.
What is the correct definition of a Cartesian closed category?
Some books seem to say that a CCC has a finite limits plus
the relevant conditions to give you exponitails. 
While other books seem to define it as finite products plus exponitails.
Am I reading all these books wrong (I always thought it was all finite limits
so I might of systimacitally misread lots of books since). 
Or can you get finite limits from finite products (but where do you get
the equalisers form?)

Justin Pearson

I am afraid that different authors make different asssumptions.  I guess
the minimum you want is finite products (except that a C-monoid is
sometimes defined as a CCC with one object, so it has only finite
non-empty products), while others will want finite limits.  They are
definitely different, no doubt of that and the complexity of the
computations in the initial CCC of those types is different too, so the
difference is important.  There is an open question of some interest:
can an FP CCC with NNO be embedded into an FL CCC with NNO in a way
that preserves the NNO.  I conjecture that it cannot, but if it
could, that would have some interesting consequences.

Justin Pearson asks what is the "correct" definition of Cartesian closed
category. 

I would say that the definition most commonly used is that a category C
is a cartesian closed category (ccc) if it has specified terminal
object, binary products, and exponentials for each pair of objects.

This means that there is a (natural and) precise correspondence between
cccs, and equational theories with unit type, binary products and
function types.

What is potentially confusing is that a Cartesian category is often
taken to mean a category with finite limits (binary products and
equalisers) because Descartes's work involved equationally defined
subsets. For this reason it might be best to call cccs (def. as having
finite products and exponentials) by a different name, say exponential
categories---but here "best" is clearly of dubious meaning !

Just as Eilenberg's "co-six" category (all sets / or all finite sets /
of cardinality other than  6 ) provides an example of a closed category
that's not (but is almost) cartesian closed, so what one might call
"co-five" (all sets / or all finite sets / of cardinality other than  5 )
provides an example of a cartesian closed category (in the second sense)
not having all equalizers (so not finitely complete).

For some purposes one cares not a fig about the presence/absence of
finite limits (other than products, of course) -- for other purposes
one cares a lot.

[Of course almost any prime could have been used in place of the prime  5 .]

From: Steven Vickers <sjv@doc.ic.ac.uk>

>What is the correct definition of a Cartesian closed category?

MacLane ("Categories for the Working Mathematician") and many other
standard texts do not assume equalizers in a CCC, nor in a Cartesian
category.

If your interest in CCCs is that they provide categorical models for the
typed lambda calculus, then you don't need equalizers (see Lambek and
Scott, "Intro. to Higher Order Categorical Logic"), and many of the
standard examples in computer science don't have them.

I can recall only one case of the other usage, where CCCs have all finite
limits, and even there it was explained as a nonstandard convention.

Freyd and Scedrov ("Categories - Allegories") define "Cartesian" to mean
having all finite limits. Obviously one associates Cartesian coordinates
with finite products, but they point out that Descartes was also concerned
with equationally defined subsets, and those are equalizers. They avoid the
phrase "Cartesian closed category".

If you want my personal opinion, it's that neither CCCs nor - despite the
force of Freyd and Scedrov's comment - Cartesian categories are exected to
have limits other than finite products.

(Correction to an earlier posting - sorry)

I wrongly stated that MacLane in Categories for Working Mathematicians
defines Cartesian categories to be those that have finite products. He
doesn't define the term at all. However, his Cartesian closed categories
are indeed categories with finite products and exponentials.

Thanks to Roy Crole for pointing this out.

Lift monad

I have made my 1992 prepint  on the lift monad on posets 
available by ftp. It describes some properties of the monad 
which to a poset freely adjoins suprema for subsets with at 
most one element (if the logic is boolean, this means just: 
adjoining a bottom element).

The file (LaTeX) is called lif.tex, and may be picked up by 
anonymous ftp in the directory papers/Kock at the site

It is identical to Aarhus Preprint Series 1992, No.22,

Subject: oriented singular homology 

Date: Thu, 12 May 94 13:14:49 EDT
From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

A couple months ago, I inquired if anyone knew anything about oriented
singular homology.  Not receiving any replies, I worked on the question
myself.  The answer is in the abstract below.

Let C_n denote the nth singular chain functor on the category of
topological spaces.  Viewing C_n as the free abelian group on the
functor represented by Delta_n = {(t_0,...,t_n) | t_i >= 0 and t_0 +
... + t_n = 1}, it is clear there is a right action of the
permutation group Sigma_{n+1} by composition.  Let U_n be the set of
all sigma p - sgn(p) sigma for sigma a singular n-simplex and p a
permutation.  Let V_n consist of U_n together with all simplexes
sigma such that sigma = sigma p for some transposition p and let W_n
consist of U_n together with all simplexes sigma such that sigma =
sigma p for some odd permutation p.  Then U, V and W are
subcomplexes and all the maps in C --> C/U --> C/V --> C/W are
homtopy equivalences (with natural transformations for the homotopy
inverses as well as the homotopies themselves.  The proof uses the
original cotriple cyclic models theorem that Jon Beck and I proved
in 1965.

Subject: Stone duality 

Date: Mon, 23 May 1994 19:15:39 +0200 (MET DST)
From: Paul Johnson <johnson@karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

One aspect of Stone duality is the representation of each 
Boolean algebra as a subset B -> P(X)
(for some set X)
which is closed under the set-theoretic Boolean operations on P(X).

My guess is that this result persists over an arbitrary Boolean
topos E, provided one assumes there are enough prime ideals, ie.
that for each Boolean algebra B over V,
the subobject X -> E(B,Omega) consisting of lattice homomorphisms
is (in some sense) large enough???

Cheers, PBJ.

ABSTRACTS OF COURSES:

     Pratt:  "Chu Spaces: Complementarity and Uncertainty in Rational
              Mechanics"
"Rational mechanics" captures mind-body duality for autonomous agents in
essentially the same way that quantum mechanics captures momentum-position
duality for physical systems, with Chu spaces in place of Hilbert spaces.
Chu spaces expose a Heisenberg-like uncertainty principle as a previously
unnoticed yet prominent feature of Stone duality.
                         ---------------
     Venema:  "Boolean Algebras with Operators & Modal Logic"
Formalisms related to Modal Logic play an important role in theoretical
computer science:  think of examples like epistemic logic, dynamic logic
or relational algebra.  Such formalisms can be treated in a nice algebraic
way via the theory of Boolean Algebras with Operators (BAOs).  The course
will be centered around two themes: (1) the duality between BAOs and
Relational (Kripke) Structures, and (2) modal/algebraic languages to
describe these structures. We will review some important and elegant
theorems, like automatic completeness results for a large class of logics.
                         ---------------
     Nemeti and Andreka:  "Algebras of Relations of Various Ranks &
                           their Applications"
Theories of relations (binary ones, ternary relations, n-ary ones etc.)
play an essential role both in Computer Science and in Logic.  Besides
quantifier logics, they are important for e.g. logics of the dynamic trend,
resource-sensitive logics, substractural logics, logics of actions etc.
We will study algebras whose elements are relations.  Research in this
area has been going on for 140 years, hence its theory is powerful and
profoundly applicable.  The goal of the course is to make rich theory
accessible, to provide insight into why and how it works, and to highlight
the main directions in which it is "moving".
                         ---------------
     Workshop given by young researchers:  "Decidability issues and logics
                                            related to the dynamic trend"
The workshop will consist of talks given by young researchers from the
Logic School centered around Amsterdam and Budapest.  The topics will be
related to those of the main courses.  A tentative list is: decidability
issues (decision problems for Boolean algebras with operators, relation
algebras and algebras of relations of higher ranks), decidability of
logics of the dynamic trend, positive results on the finitization problem
(e.g. on the search for powerful algebras of relations forming a finitely
axiomatizable equational class), the connection between algebraic logic
and logic.  This list is more likely to expand than shrink.
The purpose of these talks is to focus on new results and provide the
audience with open problems which might be rewarding to work on.
The speakers of the workshop will be Viktor Gyuris, Agnes Kurucz,
Maarten Marx, Szabolcs Mikulas and Andras Simon.

Subject: Name change 

Date: Tue, 31 May 94 10:31:02 BST
From: John Power <ajp@dcs.ed.ac.uk>


Dear Colleagues,
		In the early 70's, Dana Scott founded the "Peripatetic
Seminar on Sheaves and Logic", and it has thrived. However, recently,
several new people in related areas, in particular Computer Science,
have been put off by the title: they say they know nothing about
sheaves, so assumed the seminar would not interest them.
	So at the latest meeting, this weekend, we discussed a possible
name change (and implicitly a precise formulation of the subject of
the seminar). It was agreed to hold a competition for a new name. Dana
agreed to adjudicate, and is offering a bottle of Scotch to the winner:
he reserves the right to withdraw the offer if no entry impresses
him.
	Evidently, a new name should reflect the interests of all
people we would like to attract, including sheaf theorists, but also
people in related parts of Computer Science and Physics.
	Please send all entries to me; I will collate them, and forward
them to Dana. It would be best to have a decision before the next
seminar is announced, probably late in summer.
	Best wishes,
		John Power.
