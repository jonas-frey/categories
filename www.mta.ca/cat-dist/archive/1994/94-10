Subject: ??? coherent , T_{0} => sober ??? 

Date: Sat, 1 Oct 1994 05:23:38 +0100
From: Maria Joao Frade <mjf@di.uminho.pt>

Dear Group,

I would be very greatful if someone could help me to make clear the following 
situation  (doubt) :


In article "Domain Theory in Logical Form" (1991) S. Abramsky says
(definition 2.3.2) that

   a space X is coherent if the \Omega(X) is a coherent local

and in theorem 2.3.3 (iii) he writes 

	  CohSp \simeq CohLoc \simeq DLat^{op}

where CohSp is the category of coherent T_{0} spaces, and continuous
maps which preserve compact-open subsets under inverse image.


But, in Johnstone's book "Stone Spaces" (1982) it is written (II.3.4)
that 

    a space X is coherent if it is sober and \Omega(X) is a coherent local

and in the corollary (Stone's representation theorem for distributive
lattices) he writes 
    
    The category DLat is dual to the category CohSp of coherent spaces
    and coherent maps between them.


>From the above definitions and results, I wonder if the following
result is true:
    If the space X is T_{0} and \Omega(X) is a coherent local
    then the space X is sober
   
I have looked around and I didn't find that result. Am I
misunderstanding something ?


I'm finishing my MSc. thesis on "Behavior and State" and for the
work I'm developing a result like the above would be very helpful.
So, I would be very greatful if you could help me.


Thanks in advance for time and trouble,

	Maria Joao Frade

The standard definitions of coherent - or spectral - space (e.g. Hochster's
in Trans AMS 142, 1969) clearly include sobriety as part of the definition
(in Hochster: every closed irreducible subspace has a generic point), and
that "T_0 + Omega X coherent" is insufficient.

For a counterexample, let D be the Kahn domain of finite and infinite bit
streams (i.e. order is prefix order, topology is Scott), and let D' be the
subspace formed by removing a single infinite point. The inclusion D' -> D
gives an isomorphism between Omega D' and Omega D, which is coherent, and
D' is T_0. However, D' is not sober, because it lacks the point that was
taken out.

I think therefore that Samson's Defn 2.3.2 ought to be modified to include
sobriety as part of the definition, and that Theorem 2.3.3 needs mild
rewording (e.g. delete "T_0"). Apart from that, I'd be very surprised if
there's anything else in the whole paper that has to be changed as a
result.

I'm afraid this was a slip of the pen on my part. I should have included
sobriety in the definition of coherent space (and then omitted T_0 in
2.3.3(iii)).

This is what comes of trying to be ``helpful'' ...
I included this material as general background only. Theorem 2.3.3 is
never used in the remainder of the paper.

Subject: query of M.J.Frade 

Date: Mon, 3 Oct 94 14:27:29 -0500
From: James Madden <madden@marais.math.lsu.edu>

In response to Maria Joao Frade <mjf@di.uminho.pt>, I believe the  
following is true:

Let $X$ be an infinite space with the cofinite topology, i.e.,  
$U\subseteq X$ is open if and only if $U$ is empty or the complement  
of $U$ is finite.  This space is ${\bf T}_0$---${\bf T}_1$,  
even---but it is not sober, since $X$ is irreducible closed, but $X$  
is not the closure of any point.  (You can make $X$ into a coherent  
space by adding a generic point for $X$.)

$\Omega(X)$ is coherent.  It is isomorphic to ${\rm Idl}(L)$, where  
$L$ is the lattice of all $\{0,1}\}$-valued functions on $X$ that are  
$1$  except at finitely many points.

This paper contains the work of Moez Alimohamed, a mathematics graduate 
student at the University of Pennsylvania who died tragically on August 29th.
Lambda definability is characterized in categorical models of simply typed 
lambda calculus with type variables.  A category-theoretic framework known 
as glueing or sconing is used to extend the Jung-Tiuryn characterization of 
lambda definability in Henkin models for the simply typed lambda calculus 
first to ccc models, and then to categorical models of the calculus with 
type variables.

This is certainly the primary reference. Unfortunately there were problems 
with Burroni's original proof that {toposes + logical morphisms} is 
monadic over GRAPH. These are dealt with in 

E.J. Dubuc and G.M. Kelly. "A presentation of topoi as algebraic relative to 
categories or graphs", Journal of Algebra (81), 1983, 420-433. 

There is also a certain amount of material on the example of toposes in 

J. Lambek and P.J. Scott. "Introduction to Higher Order Categorical Logic", 
CUP, 1986. 

I suppose the main point of graphical algebras is that they give a syntax 
for describing any category finitarily monadic over GRAPH as a category of 
"algebras". A proof of that was known to Kelly at a quite early stage, but 
can be recovered from the general machinery in 

G.M. Kelly and A.J. Power. "Adjunctions whose units are coequalizers, and 
presentations of finitary enriched monads", Jounal of Pure and Applied 
Algebra 89 (1993), 163-179

There is also an account in my survey:

Subject: A query about quantales 

Date: Mon, 17 Oct 1994 14:52:11 +0100 (BST)
From: Francois Lamarche <gfl@doc.ic.ac.uk>

Has anyone every considered the following class of quantales?  If  *  is
the tensor and I its unit, the additional axiom

u*v = I   implies  u=v=I

holds.  If anybody has used them how are they called? Actually I am
interested in the ones among them that are also commutative and where I
is a dualizing element.  In other words they are a specific class of
Girard quantales.  There is an interesting subclass of them:  look at
the following list of multiplication tables.

 *| I  1 -1    *| I  1  0 -1    *| I  2  1 -1 -2
-----------   --------------    ----------------
 I| I  1 -1    I| I  1  0 -1    I| I  2  1 -1 -2
 1| 1  1 -1    1| 1  1  0 -1    2| 2  2  1 -1 -2
-1|-1 -1 -1    0| 0  0 -1 -1    1| 1  1  1 -2 -2
              -1|-1 -1 -1 -1   -1|-1 -1 -2 -2 -2
                               -2|-2 -2 -2 -2 -2

It is easy to see this generalizes for any set of the form

{ I, n,n-1,...,1,0,-1,...,-(n-1),-n }  or
{ I, n,n-1,...,1,  -1,...,-(n-1),-n }.

The slogan is "take the table for inf in the total ordering given by the
writing order and overwrite the lower right triangle with -n".  The
dualizing operator is multiplication by -1 (keeping I fixed, natch). It
suffices to say what is the set of elements >= 1 to define the order on
the quantale, and it is always {n,I}.  Thus the Hasse diagrams look like
     
      1     1          2
      |    / \        / \
      I   0   I      1   \
      |    \ /       |    I     ...
     -1    -1       -1   /
                      \ /
                      -2

This can be generalized even further:  given a complete lattice with 
an involution  (-)~ : A^{op} -> A ,  on the set A+{I} define *
as follows:

            /  a        if  b = I,   ( b if a = I )
a*b    =   <   bottom   if  a =< b~ 
            \  a inf b  if  a not =< b~

Here as before the set of elements >= I is {top, I}
Have these ever been considered?  Do they have a name?

----- End Included Message -----


The subject of graphical algebras is highly interesting (to my taste !) but 
rather controversial : there have been many mathematical misunderstandings and many 
quarrels about who did what and when. Here are the main lines of my account of 
the subject. 

In my opinion the fundamental notion is that of an algebraic functor in the sense
of Coppey : this definition of algebricity is of a very intuitive and elementary
nature and is for me THE definition of algebricity. The corresponding framework was 
introduced in [Coppey72] and is also described in [Coppey-Lair85]. An algebraic
functor need not have a left adjoint. In fact U is monadic iff U is algebraic and 
has a left adjoint ! However an algebraic functor "with rank" is monadic. Now a
category of graphical algebras in the sense of Burroni is exactly a category C 
with an algebraic functor C -> Graph. A controversial question (between Coppey 
and Burroni !) is : are graphical algebras of any special importance ?
The only partial answer I can give is about the use of categories in computer 
science : I have never seen any computer scientist make use of the fact that a
given type of structured categories (say c.c.c.'s) is algebraic over graphs. What
is really used is the algebraicity over "graphs with formal constructors" (some 
kind of generalized sketches). The problem is that many sources that use that kind of 
algebricity refer to Burroni's graphical algebras which is completely misleading :   
for example the book [Lambek-Scott86] and the paper [Coquand-Ehrard87]. 

Categories with specified (co)limits of a given kind are algebraic over categories :
this is a classical result by Lair ([Lair75] or [Lair79]). In some cases 
((co)products, (co)equalizers) they are also algebraic over graphs : see [Burroni81]
and [Coppey-Lair85]. Cartesian closed categories as well as elementary topoi are 
also algebraic over graphs : the history of these results is not simple and 
involves at least [Burroni81], [Dubuc-Kelly83], [MacDonald-Stone84] and [Ageron91]. 
An interesting example is that of Peano-Lawvere categories. It follows from general 
reasons that they are algebraic over categories; Burroni raised the question : are they
algebraic over graphs - it was solved negatively in [Coppey-Lair85].

Much more could be said on that subject, e.g. the link between algebricity and 
sketchability but this message is already too long. I refer to [Ageron91] for a
synthetic introduction and to [Coppey-Lair85] for more.

Dear categories,

In ``Stone spaces'', Johnstone notes that the assumption that
every coherent locale is spatial is equivalent to the 
prime ideal theorem for distributive lattices.

Is it generally agreed that the assumption that the spatial
part of every coherent locale has coherent topology is
also equivalent to the above two axioms?

In a hopeless reply to  my own querie,
it seems (after one sleepless night)
less and less likely that (C) ==> (B).

Ironically, since the trivial locale is coherent (and spatial),
for a coherent locale A to have a non-coherent spatial part,
it must have a point.

Conversely, axiom (C) still appears quite strong,
and I mean for tangible reasons:
For example, (C) holds iff the passage from coherent spaces
to distributive lattices has a left adjoint in coherent maps,
thus identifying what I would call the 
``constructively-spatial'' distributive
lattices as reflective in all.

But might (C) hold without assuming any choice???
Apparently, most of this battle can be fought at the
level of Boolean algebras, but the reductions I have
yet to have sorted out.


Cheers, PBJ.

I don't know a reference, but I know that very few colimits exist.
For example, the sum of two non-zero spaces cannot exist for you can
give the direct sum of the normed spaces either the sup or euclidean
norm and these would both have to embed isometrically in the sum,
which is clearly impossible.  Clearly coequalizers are likewise
precluded.  It seems possible that filtered colimits might make it;
you would take the ordinary colimit as inner product spaces and
complete.  I don't offhand see what can go wrong with that.

From: "John G. Stell" <john@cs.keele.ac.uk>


What results of the form  `A sub-X of a free X is free' are known?
I am aware of groups, magmas (= set with binary operation), and
modules over a principal ideal domain. I'd be interested to hear of 
structures for which this is either known to be true, or examples
where it fails.

{\Large\bf Announcement 56$^{\mbox{\small\bf th}}$ PSSL}
\end{center}

The 56$^{\mbox{\scriptsize th}}$ {\em Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic}
will be held in the weekend of 3 and 4 December at the University of Aarhus, Denmark. As usual, we welcome talks on topics in logic, category theory
and related areas in mathematics and computer science. Please publicize this meeting amongst your colleagues.

At the time of the meeting, Ieke Moerdijk is in Aarhus as a guest of the
Mathematics Department.

The meeting will be jointly sponsored by the Mathematics department and the
research centre BRICS (Basic Research In Computer Science), so no fees are
to be expected.

There are two airports serving Aarhus: Tirstrup (Aarhus airport), which is
about 50 kilometres from the city and has a good bus connection to it, and
Billund, which lies about 100 kilometres from Aarhus and has connection by
bus (directly) or bus to Vejle and train from there (in some instances, the
latter connection is quicker). Further details, also about accomodation, will
follow. As we try to arrange relatively cheap accomodation in student houses,
it will be appreciated if attendants register as soon as possible.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: XY-pic version 2.12 released... 

Date: Tue, 25 Oct 1994 13:17:10 +0100
From: kris@diku.dk

Dear category theorist,

This is to announce yet another BUG FIX release of my DIAGRAM DRAWING
PACKAGE, XY-pic: version 2.12.  It fixes the following user visible
bugs in version 2.11:

* No conflict with `AMS-LaTeX' version 1.2 (SEE BELOW).

* No conflict with Karl Berry's `eplain' (SEE BELOW).

* Curves with explicit control are now right [Sjoerd Crans].

* Directional vectors no longer invalidate the Xy-state [Luc van Eycken].

* Tips on zero-sized turns no longer reversed [Jorge Almeida].

* Curves no longer overlap the surrounding text.

* Numerous documentation fixes in the Reference Manual.

* Short steep segments now placed correctly [thanks, Ross].

I am sorry to announce this very interim version which is necessary
because of a change in an internal function of AMS-LaTeX [sic].  Thus

      ** PLEASE UPDATE TO VERSION 2.12 IF YOU USE AMS-LaTeX ***

The release of the `real' version 3 (no longer in beta-test) is
imminent so you need not update otherwise unless any of the other bugs
have bothered you (or you desperately need one of the additions
described below).

There is ONE IMPORTANT CHANGE in the v3 extensions of this version:
the \arrow command has been renamed to \ar in order to make diagrams
more concise and avoid conflict with Karl Berry's `eplain', however,
using the `v2' compatibility option will still define \arrow (as well
as \stop and \merge that are also in conflict with existing names on
some systems).

				- o -

One extension and one feature have been added with this release:

* \xyoption{cmtip} allows the use of arrow tips that resemble those
  of D. Knuth's Computer Modern and Computer Concrete fonts.

* \xyoption{poly} supports drawing of regular polygons (by Ross Moore).

Version 3 will also have a special input mode for `knots and links'.

				- o -

Xy-pic can be retrieved by anonymous ftp from

  ftp.diku.dk : 	/diku/users/kris/TeX/
  ftp.mpce.mq.edu.au :	/pub/maths/TeX/

(see the README file as to the exact location below that), from

  CTAN :		/tex-archive/macros/generic/diagrams/xypic

and also through the World Wide Web (see below).

				- o -

NEWS: there is now a World Wide Web HOME PAGE for Xy-pic in

  <URL: http://www.diku.dk/users/kris/Xy-pic.html>

which includes pointers to the sources as well as some TUTORIAL PAPERS
on Xy-pic:

* K.Rose: Xy-pic and Notation for Categorical Diagrams.

* R.Moore: Typesetting Neural Nets with Xy-pic.

(for people without WWW access these are also available on the ftp
servers in files xy/papers/ecct-94.ps and xy/papers/NeuralNets.ps).

				- o -

In the hope that you will like the new things,
						Kristoffer Rose

Subject: are local homemorphism part of a factorization system 

Date: Thu, 27 Oct 94 16:27:20 +0100
From: Thomas Streicher <streiche@informatik.uni-muenchen.de>

Does anyone know whether in the category  Geom  of toposes and  
geometric morphism the local homemorphisms form the mono part of a  
factorization system ?
Or is that at least the case in the luff subcategory where one has  
only essential geomtric morphism whose leftmost adjoint preserves  
pullbacks. Has this latter category ever been srudied ?

It is true for abelian groups, but is false for both monoids and
commutative monoids.  The free (commutative) monoid on one element x
has a submonoid consisting of 1,x^3,x^5,x^6 and all x^n for n > 7
is not free.  Throwing away 1, you get counter-examples for
semigroups and commutative semigroups.  By taking the free abelian 
group on this example, you get counter-examples for rings and
commutative rings.  I am sure that it is a fairly rare occurrence.

There is certainly a good bit more known than in Michael's response. The
varieties in which subalgebras of free algebras are free are called Schreier
varieties. A paper of mine in the early 70's -- Epimorphisms and dominions, V,
probably in Alg. Univ. -- answered someone's question (Sabbagh?): Is every
Schreier variety balanced? I remember the answer was No. John Isbell

From: Peter Freyd <pjf@saul.cis.upenn.edu>

John Stell asked when to expect subobjects of free objects to be free
and observed that such is the case for modules over prinicpal ideal
domains. For commutative rings that's the only case: if every ideal is
free as a module then the ring is a PID.

He points out that subalgebras of free algebras are free if the theory
consists of just one binary operation and no equations. Isn't that the
case for any equationless theory?
