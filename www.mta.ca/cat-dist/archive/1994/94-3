			TEACHING FORMAL METHODS
               	     CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOP


			   SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

			    Hamilton College
			      Clinton, N.Y.
			  July 30 - Aug 5, 1994
 

                      	       sponsored by
               	      The National Science Foundation



THE PURPOSE OF THE WORKSHOP is to develop modules and materials for  
teaching formal methods in an undergraduate setting. Participants  
will be asked to submit a module or position paper which they have  
developed. While the particular form and length of the module is left  
unspecified,  modules should contain both expository material and  
exercises or labs. 


TOPICS for the modules may include(but are not limited to)

    --  Propositional/ Predicate Calculus , with applications to
        assertions/pre- and post-conditions
    --  Loops and Invariants
    --  Category Theory
    --  Algorithm Design
    --  Hardware Specification/Design/Verification
    --  Parallel Constructs (eg. CSP, Hoare semantics)
    --  Operational Semantics
    --  Formal Methods with OOP
    --  Applications of Mathematica


THE WORKSHOP itself will be devoted to the presentation, discussion  
and revision of participant modules. We also anticipate inviting  
several keynote speakers. After the workshop, participants will be  
asked to submit full revised versions of their modules for  
incorporation into a collection for dissemination to computer science  
educators.  Three of the principal investigators for the project,  
Philip Mulry (Colgate University), Doug Troeger(CUNY) and Henry
Walker(Grinnell College), will be responsible for editing the  
collection of materials with a view towards publication in the near  
future.  We plan to have a followup workshop in the summer of 1995,  
in conjunction with the working group in Object Oriented Computing,  
to evaluate the results to date and further disseminate the materials  
developed.  Participants will be encouraged to use draft versions of  
the modules in their teaching for evaluation.

AN NSF GRANT will partially cover travel, room and board costs for  
the workshop. Participants will receive a stipend of $150 for their  
participation in the workshop and an additional $150 after submission  
of their revised module.

THERE MAY BE LIMITED FUNDS to support attendance by individuals who
want to become involved with the project but do not have a module to  
submit at this time.  Please write to inquire.

TO APPLY:  Send an  abstract of your module or position paper and a  
brief resume including your experience with formal methods to:

			Philip Mulry
			Formal Methods Workshop
     			Computer Science Department             

     			Colgate University
     			13 Oak Drive
     			Hamilton, New York 13346               

			email:fmworkshop@cs.colgate.edu
	

ABSTRACTS should be no more than 5 pages in length, be clearly  
written, and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee  
to assess the merits of the module. The preferred mode of submission  
is via email.  The preferred abstract format is latex.  Submission of  
abstracts should be received by March 20, 1994 by the program chair.   
This is a firm deadline, late submissions will not be considered.   
Participants will be notified of acceptance by April 1, 1994.   
Accepted modules (in a specified format) will be due
July 1, 1994. A final revised module will be due November 1, 1994.

Subject: XY-pic v.2.7: Graphs and diagrams in TeX RELEASED! 

Date: Tue, 8 Mar 1994 21:11:11 +1000
From: Kristoffer Rose <kris@zeus.mpce.mq.edu.au>
Reply to: kris@diku.dk

Dear XY-pic current, former, and potential XY-pic interestees,

This is to announce the release of a new version of my DIAGRAM DRAWING
PACKAGE, XY-pic: version 2.7.  The release is slightly overdue (16
months late, in fact) but this is due to the ABUNDANCY OF NEW FEATURES
in the package.

Below I have attached the TRAILER of the package that gives some more
details and explains how to obtain it.

If you have lost interest in XY-pic then I apologise; otherwise I hope
that you'll find it worth the wait!

Regards,
	 Kristoffer Rose (.signature at the end below)

======================================================================
TRAILER: ANNOUNCING THE XY-pic version 2.7 DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE
======================================================================

XY-pic is a package for typesetting a variety of graphs and diagrams
within TeX that works with most formats (including LaTeX 2.09, LaTeX2e
in compatibility mode, AMS-LaTeX, AMS-TeX, and plain TeX).

XY-pic version 2.7 has been a long time underway because it is a MAJOR
REWRITE of XY-pic.  The reason is that the version 2.6 code has been
reorganised into a kernel and several orthogonal modules to make the
development of XY-pic 3 possible while maintaining backwards
compatibility.  Therefore

* version 2.7 is a BETA TEST release in the sense that it is likely to
  contain bugs in both documentation and code!  If you are a version
  2.6 user then PLEASE TEST this release with your existing diagrams
  and REPORT PROBLEMS you encounter to the author: the intention is to
  maintain full backwards compatibility but I need feed-back from
  users in order to achieve this goal (see the `Incompatibilities'
  appendix in the User's Guide for some known problems)!

* version 2.7 is an ALPHA TEST and RFC release of the forthcoming
  XY-pic version 3 being developed by myself in collaboration with
  Ross Moore while visiting Macquarie U, Sydney, until May 1994.  It
  will add special modes for convenient specification of at least the
  following high-level diagram types Generalised trees, Planar graphs,
  Commutative diagrams with 2-cells, and String and braid diagrams, as
  well as provide special output drivers for at least PostScript
  (eliminating the need for special fonts in this case).  If you wish
  to peek at the kind of diagrams we are working on then take a look
  at the files available for ftp at ftp.mpce.mq.edu.au in
  /pub/maths/tex/Quantum (and trough my WWW hyperlink cited below).

The package will also be provided as a LaTeX2e and LaTeX3 `package' as
soon as the guidelines for how to do this are available to the author.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 2.7 FEATURES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

XY-pic version 2.7 provides two modes of specifying drawings:

* A matrix-like mode where the dimensions of the drawing are
  automatically computed by aligning diagram entries in rows and
  columns (this is also the `version 2 compatibility mode').

* A general `turtle graphic' drawing language for specifying graphs
  with objects and connections between them in a manner independent of
  orientation.

Both modes support the following specific features:

+ Positions can be given in variety of formats (extendable) including
  user defined coordinates (x,y) and relative to previous positions,
  objects, object edges, and points on connections.

+ Objects may be circular or rectangular (more shapes can be added)
  and adjusted in several ways.

+ Large library of objects with mnemonic names.

+ Objects that orient themself along a connection when placed relative
  to it, e.g., `\dir{|-}' is like \vdash but thus oriented.

+ Includes circle segments and arbitrary TeX text.

+ Connections are aligned between the reference points of objects but
  start and end on the edges.

+ Any object can be used to build a connection (using `diagonal
  filling'); library objects provide common line types.

+ Special notation for drawing arrows with tail, stem, and head build
  from any object(s).  Special support for arrows that cross each
  other, arrows that `go by' other entries, combined arrows, and
  arrows with n/8 bends.

+ Library of frames.

If you wish to check out the facilities (using a 300 dpi PostScript
printer), then you can print the file `xyguide.ps' that contains a
preformatted version of the User's Guide.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
AVAILABILTY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

XY-pic is available by anonymous ftp from at least the following sites:

  ftp.diku.dk : 	/diku/users/kris/TeX/xy27run.tar.Z
  ftp.mpce.mq.edu.au :	/pub/maths/TeX/xy27run.tar.Z

The same locations also contains manuals formatted for printing on
300dpi PostScript printers in `xyguide.ps.Z' and `xyrefer.ps.Z' and a
special distribution for Textures (by ross@mpce.mq.edu.au) in
`xy27mac.sit.hqx'; check out the README files!

You can also use my WWW hyperlink cited below to retrieve the package.

Please note that XY-pic is `copyleft' under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the end of the TRAILER.  I hope you will enjoy XY-pic!

Dear Colleagues:
   Cambridge University Press is going into the 4th printing
of our book "Introduction to Higher Order Categorical Logic"
by Jim Lambek and me, and have asked us for any typos
(major rewrites are not possible, alas).
       If anyone knows of typos (there were many
in the first printing, due to CUP error, most were corrected
by the 3rd paperback)  we would appreciate hearing about it.
You can write to me (Phil Scott) at the address below.
    Thanks in advance,

Subject: term rewriting and sesqui-categories 

Date: Fri, 11 Mar 1994 11:18:20 +0000 (GMT)
From: "John G. Stell" <john@cs.keele.ac.uk>


The following paper is available by anonymous ftp.

        MODELLING TERM-REWRITING SYSTEMS BY SESQUI-CATEGORIES.

                               Abstract

    It is well-known that a term rewriting system gives rise to a 2-category
    in which the objects are finite sets of variables, the morphisms are 
    substitutions, and the 2-cells are rewrites. This paper demonstrates that
    a generalization of a 2-category, called a sesqui-category, is a more
    appropriate categorical model for a term rewriting system.  This is
    principally because, unlike the case of a 2-category, the sesqui-category
    associated to a term rewriting system supports a notion of length on its 
    2-cells.  This notion of length is used in developing definitions of local
    confluence and critical pair in the context of an arbitrary sesqui-category
    with length and certain additional structure. The relationship between
    these abstract definitions and their usual term rewriting counterparts is
    established. This provides some evidence that sesqui-categories may be an
    appropriate vehicle for an abstract theory of rewriting capable of handling
    critical pairs.

The first-order properties of a Grothendieck topos include all of
first-order arithmetic, hence there can not be a complete
axiomization.

From: Bob Rosebrugh

Mike Barr has mentioned that a large mail alias list is maintained on the
triples machine at McGill, and that anyone is free to use it. For example,
I can be reached by sending mail to
rosebrugh@triples.math.mcgill.ca

The triples list contains several hundred names of interest to readers of
categories. Like Vaughan Pratt's structures directory, the triples list
uses surnames, with single initials where necessary as in asmith, bsmith.

Subject: holomorph 

Date: Wed, 16 Mar 94 10:42:28 +0100
From: Pierre Ageron <Pierre.Ageron@univ-caen.fr>



   Thank you to all people who contributed to the discussion about Cantor-
Bernstein. I learnt many interesting things, although what I had I mind was 
rather the general categorical structure underlying the proof. A similar 
question could be asked about the "elementary" proof of the following theorem :
if there is an injection from A to B, then there is injection from 2A to 2B.


Another question. The construction of the holomorph of a group is well-known :

Hol(G) = G x Aut(G) .

Similar constructions can be done for graphs, categories, sketches, ...
Has anyone seen anything about that ? 

                      Pierre Ageron

Subject: holomorph 

Date: Thu, 17 Mar 1994 08:37:35 +0000
From: "Prof R. Brown" <mas010@bangor.ac.uk>

In reply to Pierre Ageron's question:

A nice way to regard the holomorph is as follows. The category (groups) is 
embedded in the category Gd=(groupoids), which is cartesian closed. So Gd 
has an internal endomorphism and also automorphism object AUT(-) (the 
maximal internal subgroup object of END(-)). So if G is a group, then AUT(G) 
is a group-groupoid, also known as a cat^1-group. As a group it is 
isomorphic to the holomorph of G. (See for example, J Shrimpton, JPAA 72 
(1991) 303-318 for background.) Under the correspondence between 
group-groupoids and crossed modules, the holomorph of G corresponds to the 
crossed module G--> Aut(G) given by the inner automorphism map. Shrimpton 
gets an analogous crossed module Q(\Gamma) --> Aut(\Gamma) when \Gamma is a 
directed graph, and this has an associated group-groupoid, which can be 
called the holomorph of \Gamma. 

So the holomorph should be regarded as simply the internal automorphism 
object (in the appropriate category). If the objects don't form a cartesian 
closed category to start with, then something must be done about it (like 
turning groups into groupoids). 

Maybe you can only form a monoidal closed category. Then you have problems 
with group objects. See Brown and Gilbert Proc London Math Soc (3) 59 (1989) 
51-73 for an example of what can be done (in this case with the category of 
crossed modules, where the cartesian closed structure is not the really 
interesting one). 

The area is interesting, in view of the widespread use of groups in maths 
and science.  What are and what should be "groups"? If S is a structure, how 
can and should Aut(S) be structured?

From: Clemens Cap <cap@ifi.unizh.ch>
   
   I have two questions, which I hope, someone has the answer or a pointer
   where I could obtain some hints:
   
   
   Question 1:
   
     Let C be a CCC, which not necessarily is a free CCC. Is there a reasonable
     way of typing C ?
   
     More precisely: If X is an object in a (not necessarily free) Cartesian
     closed category, is it possible to tell, whether X is of the form
     Y => Z or of the form Y x Z, with suitably chosen Y and Z ?
   
     The problem I have is the following: Assume D is a free CCC constructed 
     over a set of constants. Now identify some of the objects in D to yield
     the not-free CCC C. Now we could think of a situation, where an object
     in C is of the form U x V and at the same time of the form W => R.
     On the other hand, the restrictions on the identifications of D-objects,
     which come from the requirement, that C again is a CCC, could prevent
     that an object in C could have two possible forms.
   
   
   Question 2:
   
     What about the same problem in a symmetric monoidal closed category ?
     Here things are a bit more complicated, since the bifunctor x no longer
     is a product and there are no decomposing projection morphisms.
     In fact, an object which has the form A x (B x C) could be 
     indistingusihable or even identical to an object of the form (A x B) x C.
     
     What is known here ?
     Can an object at the same time be of the form U x V and of the form
     W => x ?? And what about identifications of products due to assoviativity
     commutativity and neutrality ?
   
   
   Please reply to cap@ifi.unizh.ch.
   
   THANX A LOT FOR YOUR HELP.

       Can an object at the same time be of the form U x V and of the form
       W => x ??

Yes, since it is possible for these to have the same cardinality
(e.g., cpo's).

Subject: question of Clemens Cap 

Date: Sat, 19 Mar 94 16:20:21 EST
From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.Math.McGill.CA>
 
A propos question 1, there is always the example of a Scott monoid
which is a CCC with one object D such that (necessarily) D = D x D =
D ==> D.  Ok, it is not quite a CCC, since it lacks an empty
product, but add one so you have two objects 1 and D with the above
properties.

This answers question 2 too, but in addition, Beck showed over 20
years ago that any monoidal category with a coherent associativity
isomorphism is equivalent, as a monoidal category, to a strictly
associative one.

From: Edmund Robinson <edmundr@cogs.susx.ac.uk>

Dear Prof Cap,

I just wanted to reinforce the replies of Mitchell and Barr. In any 
Heyting algebra (cartesian closed poset) there is a great deal of 
redundancy. In particular, 1 x U = U = 1 => U. And in Set, 
0 x U = 0 = V => 0 for any non-empty V, since the empty-set is unique. 
These are cartesian-closed, and hence a fortiori, monoidal closed, but 
they are rather semantic models. 

If you are thinking of presentations of categories as cartesian closed/ 
symmetric monoidal closed subject to certain equations, then I do not 
know of any work on syntactic criteria for the equations which would 
prevent the kind of identification you ask about. This is because a 
category theorist would never write an equation between objects. Instead 
they would introduce two maps between the objects (often one at least is 
pre-existing) and specify that they are inverse isomorphisms. This is 
not only more in line with "the spirit of category theory", but actually
gives you more information, since it tells you how the two structures 
on the objects are related. In your case, it would tell you, for example, 
just how a function could be looked at as an ordered pair. A simple 
equality of objects will not do this. 

best wishes

Subject: oriented homology

From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.Math.McGill.CA>

It is clear that the symmetric group on n + 1 letters acts on the 
nth singular chain group by permuting the arguments of a simplex.
Suppose we divide out that action by identifying p(sigma) with
sgn(p).sigma for each permutation p.  This gives a quotient of the
singular chain complex.  Is it known if it is equivalent to it?
The standard argument in the simplicial case seems to break down
because two simplexes can have the same vertices without being
the same.

There is going to be a new edition of CTCS (hooray!!) that incorporates

time to let us know.  Please compare against the list that appears
in my ftp directory on this computer under the name ctcsupd.tex before
sending to us.  

It will a soft cover edition and may not include the solutions
since it is intended as a student edition.  Although it seems there
will be some hard cover copies bound too.

                       First Announcement

We are pleased to announce a summer school concentrating on

        ALGEBRAIC LOGIC AND THE METHODOLOGY OF APPLYING IT,

                   July 11-17, 1994, Budapest,

which is part of the

                 TEMPUS Summer School series for
       Algebraic And Categorial Methods In Computer Science.

This will be the third one in the above mentioned series of summer
schools, attached to the TEMPUS project entitled "Algebraic and
Categorial Methods in Computer Science".  The summer school is
sponsored by the European Community TEMPUS office.

Planned courses include:

     Willem BLOK and Don PIGOZZI:  General Algebraic Logic

     Vaughan PRATT:  Chu Spaces: Theory and Applications

     Yde VENEMA:  Boolean Algebras with Operators

     Istvan NEMETI and Hajnal ANDREKA:  Algebras of Relations of
                              Various Ranks & their Applications

     Decidability issues and logics related to the dynamic trend
                          (workshop given by young researchers).

(For the time being, Yde Venema accepted our invitation only
tentatively.)

We plan to have classes from 10-12 in the mornings and 14-17 in the
afternoons from Monday to Friday and 10-12 on Saturday.

ACCOMMODATION:  In double bedrooms in Summer Hotel Hill, for 14 DM/day.
The lectures will be in the same building.  25m swimming pool and
several other sport facilities will be available.

MEALS:  Continental breakfast is available for 4 DM/day.  Lunch is
available for 5,3 DM/day.

About 60 hardcopies of a 33 page preprint entitled

"The category of representations of the general linear groups
over a finite field"

by Andre Joyal and myself has just come back from the Macquarie
University printer. It is Macquarie Math Report # 93-141 (Dec 1993);
a full treatment of the subject of Section 4 of our paper
"Braided tensor categories" Advances in Math 102 (1993) 20-78.
Since this is a categorical treatment of a fairly specialized topic,
I do not intend to conduct a general mailing of the Report. However,
if you would like a copy, I'll send one if you email me at
<street@mpce.mq.edu.au> and provide your precise postal address.
I believe Andre is having some hardcopies made at UQAM.
[The paper is stored in computers at UQAM & Macquarie and can be
sent via email, but requires my kinky software to decode.]

Peter Selinger, a student here at Penn, observes that the category of
topological spaces and local homeomorphisms fails to be complete only
because it fails to have a terminator. That is, every  _non-empty_
small diagram has a limit. Who knows a reference for this?
