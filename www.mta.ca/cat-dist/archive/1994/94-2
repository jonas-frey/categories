 In the category of chain algebras, this has been well studied
 the point being that the inverse (up to homotpy) of a 
 multiplicative homotopy equivalence is generally NOT
 mutiplicative
 the new category is known as

 and has an extensive literature

Subject: Is *Loc* regular? 

Date: Wed, 2 Feb 1994 11:21:42 +0100
From: Todd Wilson <Todd.Wilson@risc.uni-linz.ac.at>

I have been wondering lately whether every regular monomorphism of the  
category of frames is universal (= pushout stable).  But it is not hard to  
see (using, e.g., Kelly's "Monomorphisms, epimorphisms, and pull-backs"  
J.Austr.Math.Soc. 9, 1969) that this is equivalent to the question of  
whether the category of locales is a regular category.  Does anyone have an  
answer to this question?

Subject: categories of graphs 

Date: Fri, 04 Feb 1994 14:24:26 +0000
From: "Prof R. Brown" <mas010@bangor.ac.uk>

We are starting to follow up the work of John Shrimpton' Bangor thesis, 
whose aim was the application of categorical methods in group theory, and 
was partially published as "Some groups related to the symmetry of a 
directed graph" JPAA 72 (1991) 303-318, and would be grateful for 
information on publications in this area. We know of the paper by Bumby and 
Latch, Internat J Math Sci 9 (1986) 1-16, P Ribenboim Algebraic structures 
on graphs, Alg. Univ. 16 (1983) 105-123; Bill Lawvere, Qualitative 
distictions between some toposes of generalized graphs, Cont. Math. 92, 
261-299, (1989)
and would be grateful for further information. The aim of the project is to 
use categorical methods to give insight into combinatorial problems, 
constructions and questions.

A further aim was to understand Grothendieck's notion of "Teichmuller 
groupoid" referred to in "Pursuing stacks", in the sense that if what he 
asserted could be done was actually written up for surfaces, one should also 
be able to do it for graphs, (or vice versa),  and so obtain presentations 
of a "symmetry groupoid" of a graph from some decomposition into smaller 
pieces. I have no idea how to do this. Grothendieck's observation in this 
area is quoted in my survey "From groups to groupoids" Bull London Math Soc. 
19 (1987) 113-134. Part of this programme is "what should be the symmetry 
object of a given structure?". New answers should be of general interest, 
for obvious reasons. 

Shrimpton's work showed that these questions lead to that of, for example, 
inner automorphism of a directed graph, and the interpretation of this in 
graph theoretic terms. There should be more in this area.

Subject: Re: cantor-bernstein 

Date: Sat, 12 Feb 94 16:35:35 GMT
From: Dusko Pavlovic <dp5@doc.ic.ac.uk>

Hi. I was away for a while and read the postings from the last couple
of months only now. Hence this delayed reaction on Peter Freyd's
comments from January on the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem.

 > I trust that CSB holds for any boolean topos. (Anyone want to confirm?)

The other way around, the validity of CSB in a topos ALMOST implies
that the topos is boolean. "Almost" means a slightly stronger version
needs to be considered:

	(CSB*) if f:A->B and g:B->A are monics
	       then there is an iso h:A->B 
			such that for every x in A holds
			h(x) = f(x) or h(x) = g^{-1}(x)

The usual set-theoretical proof of CSB (which goes through in boolean
toposes) actually yields (CSB*). In return, (CSB*) implies
booleanness. We assume that every topos has an object of natural
numbers.

PROPOSITION. A topos is boolean if and only if it satisfies (CSB*).

PROOF of the "if" part: Let X be a subobject of Y. We use (CSB*) to
construct its complement. Define
	A = YxN 
	B = X+(YxN)

(where N is the object of natural numbers). Let f:A-->B be the
inclusion, and g:B-->A the unique arrow which maps X into the first
copy of Y in A, while it takes the copies of Y contained in B into the
second one, the third one and so on. (Formally, g is defined using the
universal property of coproducts, and the structure of N.) It is clear
that both f and g are monics.

By (CSB*), there is a bijection h:A-->B with h(x)=f(x) or
h(x)=g^{-1}(x). This means that the union of
	C = {z | h(z)=f(z)} and
	D = {z | h(z)=g^{-1}(z)}
covers A. On the other hand, the definitions of f and g imply that C
and D are disjoint. So they are complements in A. By pulling back C and D
along the inclusion of Y iso Yx{0} in A, we get two complementary
subobjects of Y. The claim is now that the intersection (pullback) X'
of D and Yx{0} is isomorphic to X -- so that the intersection of C and
Yx{0} yields the complement of X in Y.

First of all, each element <y,n> of D must surely be in the image of
g. Thus, if <y,0> is in D, then y must be in X. So X' is contained in
Xx{0}. The other way around, since h(C) is contained in f(C), the
intersection in B of X and h(C) must be empty. Therefore, X must be
contained in h(D): indeed, h is an iso, and the direct images h(C) and
h(D) must be complementary in B. But h(D) is contained in
g^{-1}(D). So X is in g^{-1}(D), i.e. g(X) is in D. Hence, Xx{0}=g(X)
is contained in X'.

	Regards to all,
	Dusko

Nice theorem from Dusko Pavlovic. But there's a better one:

 If a topos with  NNO  is  CSB  then it's boolean (where  CSB  means:
    if two objects be retracts of each other they are 
    necessarily isomorphic).

Let  _A_  be a topos with  NNO, N. Let  D  be its object that
 "classifies dense subobjects", that is, the object with a
distinguished point  t:1 -> D  such that for every double-negation
dense subobject  A' -> A  there is a unique map  A -> D  such that
 A' -> A  is the inverse image of  t:1 -> D.  (We may construct  D  as
the double-negation closure of the  t  in  Omega.)

It suffices to show that  D  is isomorphic to  1.

CSB  implies that  1 + N x D   and  N x D  are isomorphic.  Let   
1 + N x D  ->  N x D  be an isomorphism.  Preceding by the injection 
of  1  and following by the projection onto  N  we obtain
1 ->  1 + N x D  ->  N x D  -> N   which yields a countable 
partitioning of  1, that is, an (internally definable) sequence of
pairwise-disjoint subobjects whose union is  1.  Let  U  be an
arbitrary one of these subobjects. It suffices to show that the slice
topos,  *A*/U,  is boolean.  Without loss of generality, then, we may
assume that  U = 1, that is, we may assume that the map 
1 ->  1 + N x D  ->  N x D  -> N  is itself the inclusion map of a 
complemented subobject of  N.  Restated: the isomorphism carries the
complemented copy of  1  in  1 + N x D  to a complemented copy of  D
in  N x D  forcing  D  to have a complemented copy of  1.  It is left 
as an exercise to see that the only way that  D  can have a
complemented copy of  1  is if it is that copy of  1.

Can we remove the need for  NNO?  Nope. Let  M  be any finite monoid. 
The category of finite  M-sets is a topos.  Every endomorphism monoid
is finite, hence every monic (or epic) endo is an auto and  CSB  more
than holds.

Alright. The exercise goes as follows: suppose that  s:1 -> D  names a
complemented subobject.  Let  V  be the complemented subterminator
obtained by intersecting  s  and  t  and let  W  be its complement.
In  *A*/W  we have that  s  and  t  name disjoint subobjects but  t
names a dense subobject of  D  hence  W = 0. Because  V = 1  we have
s = t  naming an object both dense and complemented hence entire.

  Locally Presentable and Accessible Categories
 
  J.Adamek, J.Rosicky

Cambridge University Press
London Mathematical Society Lecture Notes Series 189
ISBN 0 521 42261 2
330 pp.

Abstract: The concepts of a locally presentable category and an accessible
category have turned out to be useful in formulating connections between 
universal algebra, model theory, logic and computer science. The aim of this
book is to provide an exposition of both the theory and the applications
of these categories at a level accessible to graduate students.
   Firstly the properties of lambda-presentable objects, locally
lambda-presentable categories, and lambda-accessible categories are
discussed in detail, and the equivalence of accessible and sketchable
categories is proved. The authors go on to study categories of algebras
and prove that Freyd's essentially algebraic categories are precisely
the locally presentable categories.  In the final chapters they treat some 
topics in model theory and some set theoretical aspects.

Contents: 0. Preliminaries, 1. Locally presentable categories, 2. Accessible
categories, 3. Algebraic categories, 4. Injectivity classes, 5. Categories
of models, 6. Vopenka's principle, Appendix: Large cardinals, Open problems.
