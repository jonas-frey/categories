In my last posting I had written:

 Peter Selinger, a student here at Penn, observes that the category of
 topological spaces and local homeomorphisms fails to be complete only
 because it fails to have a terminator. That is, every _non-empty_
 small diagram has a limit. Who knows a reference for this?

What I didn't realize is that he was correcting an error in
"Categories, Allegories." On page 50 (1.461) we wrote that the
category in question fails to have binary products. Wrong.

I'm concluding that this was not known before. It's a nice example of
a product that's very much not preserved by the forgetful functor. The
product of the space of rational numbers with itself is uncountably
large. (And for every infinite cardinal there's a space whose product
with itself has the next power-cardinal as its size.)

		PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC
		55th Meeting---Preliminary Announcement

The 55th meeting of the seminar will be held at the University of
Edinburgh's Computer Science Department over the weekend of 28-29
May 1994.  As usual, we welcome talks near the triple point
linking category theory, geometry and logic.  

We will send further information on the location of the seminar, along
with local travel details, on receipt of registration forms.  A list
of guest houses/hotels available from lme@dcs.ed.ac.uk on request.  It
is easiest for us if UK participants make their own arrangements for
accommodation, but we will be happy to try and help anyone who has any
difficulties.  Edinburgh, as one of the world's prettiest cities, is a
tourist haven in summer, so it would be advisable to secure
accommodation well in advance.

Subject: Re: local homeomorphisms 

Date: Wed, 6 Apr 1994 13:33:00 -0400 (EDT)
From: D_FELDMAN@UNHH.UNH.EDU



Allow me please to muse on Peter Freyd's two postings concerning  observations
of Peter Selinger and himself on the category of topological spaces and local
homeomorphisms.

Is the product of  X_1  and  X_2 identical to the etale space of the
sheaf that associates to an open set  U  of  X_1 all the local homeomorphisms
from  U  to  X_2?  Of course if this is right, then the roles of X_1 and
X_2 can be reversed.  Indeed, both etale spaces consist of germs of 
homeomorphisms between X_1 and X_2.

The advantage of taking this point of view, besides that fact that perhaps
the sheaf is easier to thing about than its etale space, is that it 
suggests persuing a more general construction.  In a sense that I don't
yet know how to make precise,  X_1 x X_2 is a schizophrenic object because
it lives in both toposes of sheaves, over X_1 and X_2, and it is in some
sense the universal such schizophrenic object.  So my question is, can
this be made precise so that one could ask for a universal schizophrenic
given any two toposes.  My guess is that the analogous construction
given the topos of M_1-sets and M_2-sets, M_1 and M_2 being monoids,
would be to construct the free product  M_1 * M_2, which also lives
naturally in both categories.  Moreover all M_1 * M_2-sets live in
both categories, just as all sheaves over X_1 x X_2 induce sheaves over
X_1 and over X_2.  

I don't know much about toposes.  Is there already some well-known
construction that fits the bill?

Would the category of topological spaces and partial local homeomorphisms
be complete?  I mean, partial maps which are local homeomorphism on
their locus of definition.

Preliminary Announcement:

Third Annual Workshop on
Foundational Methods in Computer Science
A workshop on applications of categories in compouter science

Dates:  June 3-5, 1994

Location: University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B. C.

Overview:
This will be the third year of the workshop on foundational methods  
in computer science.  It is an "informal, even casual", workshop  
bringing together mathematicians and computer scientists with an  
interest in category theory and its applications to computer science.

The workshop will have approximately the same format as last year,  
with a one day tutorial on June 3 and short research presentations on  
June 4 and 5.  There will not be a formal proceedings.

Guests:
We are still in the process of contacting distinguished visitors and  
guests.

Participation:
People wishing to participate should send me email at   
fmcs@math.ubc.ca.  We hope to encourage the participation of  
researchers at all levels in this workshop, including graduate  
students.

Fees:
I have made arrangements for accomodations on the UBC campus.  The  
budget has not  been completed so I don't  yet have a registration  
fee calculated.  I hope to keep  the fees to an absolute minimum.

An application for dormitory accomodation  as well as the amount of   
registration fee will come in a further communication.

LOCATION
========
The Conference is being hosted by the Conservatoire National des Arts
et Metiers (CNAM) and will be part of its Bicentennial celebration.
CNAM is a well-known engineering school where professionals are taught
by professionals.  It houses the famous Musee National Des Arts et
Techniques, and is located at 292 Rue Saint Martin in the old center
of Paris, on the right bank of the river Seine.  It is walking
distance from Les Halles, the Centre National d'Art et de Culture
Georges-Pompidou (Beaubourg), the Hotel de Ville (City Hall) and the
cathedral Notre-Dame de Paris.  The nearest Metro station is Arts et
Metiers.

Paris normally enjoys pleasant summer weather in early July.  Days are
warm, but nights may be cool.  For general information on Paris,
contact the Paris Tourist Information Office, 127 Champs Elysees,
75008 Paris, phone number 33 (1) 49 52 53 54.


RECEPTIONS
==========
A Welcome Reception will be held on Sunday evening (17:00-19:00) in a
gallery of CNAM.  The Conference Banquet will be held in the palace
housing the Senate, the upper chamber of the French Parliament.  The
palace was built in the beginning of the 17th century for Marie de
Medicis, widow of King Henry IV.  It is located in the well-known
Jardins du Luxembourg.  To reserve a place at the banquet, the
appropriate column on the registration form must be marked; a banquet
reservation on site will not be possible.


LOCAL ARRANGEMENTS
==================
Lunches are at the participants' own expense.  Participants may eat in
cafes and restaurants in CNAM's vicinity.  Telephone messages will be
delivered to participants during breaks.  Access to email will be
possible from CNAM.

The organizers cannot be held liable to conference participants for
injury, damage or loss of their personal property. It is suggested
that participants make their own insurance arrangements.


REGISTRATION DESK
=================
A registration and information desk located at the conference site
will operate on Sunday, July 3, from 15:00 to 18:00, and on the
remaining conference days from 8:00 to 18:00.


TRAVEL
======
Paris has two airports, Roissy-Charles de Gaulle, 30km north of
Paris, and Orly, 20km south of Paris.  A frequent Air France bus
service goes from Roissy to Place Charles de Gaulle-Etoile or Porte
Maillot in central Paris (the cost is about 48FF); from Orly the bus
goes to Invalides and stops on demand at Montparnasse (32FF).  There
is also train service.  From Roissy, the RER B line goes to Gare du
Nord or Chatelet; from Orly, the Orlyval goes to Antony where there
is a connection to the RER B (32FF).  A taxi from Orly to central
Paris costs about 150FF; from Roissy, 200FF.

The Metro offers a convenient way to get around the city.  Each trip
(with unlimited transfers) costs one ticket.  Tickets can be bought
individually, but a carnet of 10 is more practical.  RER lines
to the suburbs connect with the Metro and cost more.  Both Metro
and RER tickets can be purchased from ticket booths or machines.

A 40-45% discount may be obtained from AIR INTER for French domestic
blue and white flights, depending on the days of departure.  A voucher
can be requested on the registration form.

Participants requiring a visa for entry into France are strongly
advised to make their application in their home countries at least two
months prior to departure date.

From: kock@mi.aau.dk

Re: local homeomorphisms, and etendues

Comment on Feldman's description of binary products in the 
category of spaces and local homeomorphisms.

The product of an object X with itself is always the (object 
of arrows of) a groupoid, usually a rather uninteresting one. 
But in the category of spaces and local homeomorphisms, it is 
a very interesting groupoid, usually denoted \Gamma X (the 
pseudogroup of (germs of) local automorphisms of X, considered 
by Haefliger (and others?) back in the 1950's. It is also a 
groupoid in the category of spaces and all continuous maps, 
since pull-backs are preserved by the forgetful functor.

For similar reasons, X times Y is  a principal bundle over 
the groupoid \Gamma X (acting from the left), and \Gamma Y 
(acting from the right).

Similar considerations apply in the category of locales. The 
corresponding localic groupoids were in essence considered by 
Ehresmann in "Gattungen von lokalen Strukturen", under the 
name of _local_ groupoids. I presented an expose about this, 
and its relatinship to etendue theory at the PSSL in Sussex in 
March, and the manuscript I circulated, may be picked up by 
ftp from theory.doc.ic.ac.uk, directory papers/Kock. It is 
called sussex.dvi.

	Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation
			    WoLLIC '94
			July 28--30, 1994
			  Recife, Brazil

A Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation, will be held
in Recife, on the northeastern coast of Brazil, from 28th to 30th July 1994.
Contributions are invited in the form of one page (300 words) abstract in all
areas related to logic, language, information and computation, including: pure
logical systems, proof theory, model theory, type theory, constructive
mathematics, lambda and combinatorial calculi, program logic and program
semantics, nonclassical logics, nonmonotonic logic, logic and language,
discourse representation, logic and AI, automated deduction, foundations of
logic programming, logic and computation, and logic engineering.

There will be a number of guest speakers, including some who are already part
of the advanced seminars of the parallel event (see below):
J. Barwise (Indiana), J. Cunha (Porto), J. Fiadeiro (Lisbon),
D. Gabbay (London), J. Lambek (McGill), T. Maibaum (London).
Four others have confirmed their participation: N. da Costa (Sao Paulo),
H. J. Ohlbach (Saarbruecken), U. Reyle (Stuttgart), K. Segerberg (Uppsala).

Submission: One page abstracts (preferably by e-mail to the address
*** wollic94@di.ufpe.br ***) must be RECEIVED by **MAY 15, 1994**.
Authors will be notified of acceptance by June 5, 1994.  WoLLIC '94 is
sponsored by the Interest Group in Pure and Applied Logics (IGPL) and The
European Foundation for Logic, Language and Information (FoLLI).  Abstracts from
members of the IGPL will be published in the Bulletin of the IGPL
(ISSN 0945-9103) as part of the meeting report.  Selected contributed papers
will be invited for submission to a special issue of the Bulletin.

The Workshop will be part of a bigger event being held in Recife during the last
week of July 1994: the (Brazilian) IXth School of Computing, a large biennial
event in computer science in the context of Latin America.  As some of the
invited speakers for the Workshop will be giving advanced seminars (in the form
of short courses) on logic and computation in the School, the Workshop will
benefit from the fact that the School will attract a fair number of young
researchers and students in computer science from all over Latin America.
(The School is expected to have an audience of approx. 600 participants.)

The location: Recife is the capital of the sun belt coast in the northeast
of Brazil, just 8 degrees below Equator, bathed by 250+ days of sun/year (i.e. 
Caribbean-like climate).  City population is around 2.5 million and the life
style is quite relaxed.  Recife is over 450 years old, has a number of
interesting architectural samples of Portuguese colonial times (esp. XVII and
XVIII centuries), and is neighbour to picturesque Olinda, whose architectural
heritage is protected by UNESCO.

It turns out that despite my doubts, we did get the grant from the
province that we had applied for and it seems we can support one postdoc.
I forgot to check what the salary is, but it is probably in the vicinity
of $30K and can be topped up a bit with some teaching, which the chairman
says is still available.  We have two applications already and I will
consider others.  Please send an application and two letters of reference
to me if you are interested.  I will be away from April 21 to May 1, so let
me say that the letters should be in my hand by May 1.  Fax and email accepted.
The fax number is (514) 398-3800 and my name should be on it.

Date: Thu, 14 Apr 94 17:03:10 BST
From: Dusko Pavlovic <pavlovic@doc.ic.ac.uk>

In the last couple of weeks, I kept catching myself in --- uhm ---
philosophical discussions re. category theory. They were a bit hectic,
and didn't get very far... You know, for most mathematicians,
philosophy is a no-go area; one takes care not to get too
involved. But category theorists seem to be driven to it,
somehow. (Sometimes, at least.)

Anyway, hoping for comments from more experienced people, and
apologizing to those who don't want to be bothered, I would like to
put forward a couple of themes that keep coming back to me.

The starting point for one of those discussions was my paper Maps
II. Why is that simple characterisation so complicated in details?
Doesn't that mean that the setting is wrong? In a more extreme and
less serious form, I've heard a similar objection to somebody else's
work: "It is too complicated to be of interest".

Yes, category theory is the discipline of conceptual mathematics: it
helps us extract the relevant structure and discard the
contingent. "Mental hygiene" is a nice metaphor. Categories provide
means for analyzing complex situations into conceptual parts. In a
sense, they embody the first commandment of the Cartesian Method:
DIVIDE. They are tools of understanding --- so they should at least be
transparent and easy to understand themselves, shouldn't they?

But they are not. The complexity issue arises on a rather general
plan. For instance, in a recent issue of the Advances in Mathematics,
in the review of our 1991 Montreal proceedings, Gian-Carlo Rota says
that it's good that categories are still alive and well, but suggests
that all those papers should be written in two versions --- the second
one for people who might need some encouragement before "swallowing
this morass of definitions". I don't suppose you need to hear the more
extreme and less serious objections this time. Everybody knows that
most mathematicians think of category theory just as their yoga
instructors, their grandmothers and so on think of mathematics: it's
complicated and useless. Of course, yoga instructors are less likely
to be right about maths than mathematicians about categories; and
those objections to my work are probably right, at least to some
extent. So I am not trying to transform a criticism of me into a
criticism of the State. They are quite different --- but somehow
analogous, and I am trying to understand what lies behind. Is the
complexity phenomenon just subjective (and more so in the narrower
part of the telescope) or not? I mean, does the morass arise just from
our wrong settings and overly complicated proofs --- feeding people's
prejudice --- or is there more to it?

Well, I think there is often less! I want to argue for the possibility
that morass is at some places a natural state of ground, AND not
always bad or dangerous. But let me try to put this in less extreme
and more serious terms. (OK, I won't use this figure any more.)

Categories are about understanding. Understanding is a process in
time; but when it is achieved, it can often be summarized in a moment,
captured by a picture. For instance, the periodic system of
elements. In category theory, instead of wandering among equations, we
draw a diagram to see what happens. Even for a hardest theorem, one
often finds a crucial point or two, which can be retained in our
mind's eye. Then we say we understand.

Sometimes, however, understanding is essentially dynamical, and cannot
be fixed. You may understand topology, but you can hardly survey it in
a glimpse, compress it into a single idea. Or take natural language:
we understand sentences as they go, without memorizing them or trying
to capture the structure. In the morass of language, we move like
centipedes, not worrying which leg comes after the 32nd.

In mathematics and exact sciences, one tends to be sceptical towards
this dialectical kind of understanding. The imperative of logical
certainty seems to preclude it. "Clare et distincte", commanded
Cartesius, and his voice still resounds very clearly.  Mathematics
takes good care not to become a natural language! Things should be
cristal clear. Even a philosopher like me gets this. But when I look
at our concrete mathematics --- there are all those strange phenomena,
more and more of them, leading people to question the feasibility of
the current criteria of logical certainty.

Every month, an important new result is announced, with a proof that
either just computers can check, or less than 7 people around the
globe can hope to understand. Many of these proofs come with gaps ---
but then there is this new branch of computational proof theory which
measures how economic it is to allow such gaps. To a pure pure
mathematician, this is ultimate horror, although it is perhaps better
than the current practice of judging the validity of proofs by the
concensus of experts. (However, some rather serious people argue that
this practice cannot and should not be abolished: Deligne, Thomas
Kuhn.) Experts usually agree whether a gap is easy to be filled or
not, but for that long sought result about packing spheres like
cannonballs, achieved three years ago by Hsiang (I think), the experts
have not been able decide if there is a gap or not. Two equally large
groups are still arguing that there is and that there ain't.

So what can category theory hope for in this heavy-weight world of
gaps and cannonballs? Not only in the granting sense, but also ---
forgive me --- philosophically? Of course, I don't know the
answer. What I wanted to say is that category theory might be some
kind of a natural language, whether we like it or not. Hence the
morass. But, like sentences in natural language, complicated
categorical derivations are usually "simpler than they look", say
I. Children make and understand long sentences, without being able to
capture their structure. Laws of objective dialectics take care that
they don't get lost in the morass. (Otherwise, they could never be
careful enough anyway.) A very distinct experience that I had in
categorical proof theory: derivations get lengthy, sometimes scary;
you get surprised every once in a while --- but in the end, things
always turn out to be tame and natural. I wish more people would visit
the area.

Simplicity, hygiene and logical certainty are, of course, good things
when you can afford them, but "some books would be shorter if they
were not so short", wrote Kant in the foreword of his first
Critique. (Young Wittgenstein did not listen, and wrote that very
hygienic book of his, which ended up in silence.) Ata ny rate, we
should pay more attention to the dialectical contents of our science,
as Lawvere and MacLane have been saying for a long time, more or less
explicitly. This becomes even more important now, when it has become
clear that the dream of powerful, problem-solving category theory
won't come true. Complexities are not all due to a lack of category
theory, and cannot be conceptualized away. We should not try to
simplify the world, but... (But perhpaps I shouldn't philosophize it
too much either.)

From: David Yetter <dyetter@math.ksu.edu>

A few brief thoughts on Dusko's discussion:

	First, almost all definitions in mathematics when done from the
ground up are hopelessly complex.  Ask your skeptical friends to define
a continuous real-valued function on a topological space from first
principles (for them, I suppose, from axiomatic set-theory alone).

	The only reason real numbers (pairs of subsets of the set of
equivalence classes of formal ratios of formal differences of things
satisfying the Peano axioms, modulo... and satisfying.... ) don't give 
the same impression is that we are used to them and have consequently
forgotten the formal definition and the proceed to use only the properties.

	One way of making progress in mathematical understanding, indeed
the way most congenial to categorists, is to get the definitions right
so that one can forget the morass of quantifiers in the definition, and use
only the essential properties of the objects under consideration.
(Deep results, though, usually come from doing this, then briefly returning
to the less abstract level to pull out an unexpected relation between the
more abstract and the more concrete: e.g. the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem,
or Shum's freeness result for framed tangles.)

	It has been a persistent problem for category theory that we are
interested in foundational questions (which most mathematicians abhor), and
have not made it generally understood that we are really doing a kind 
of algebra (albeit a kind of algebra so potent that it can be applied to 
foundations).

	You might therefore turn aside much criticism by pointing out
that category theory is no longer abstract in the sense of having no
really interesting concrete examples:  the work of Joyal/Street, 
Freyd/Yetter, Shum, Turaev, Reshtikhin, Majid, Lyubashenko, (the physicists)
Moore/Seiberg, Kapranov/Voevodsky, and Fisher (to name but a few) are
full of remarkable categories (with additional structure requiring yet
more complex definitions!) with intimate connections to low-dimensional
topology and Hopf algebra theory.  Similarly, coming from the more
foundational uses of category theory, the realizability topos is surely one
of the most beautiful objects anywhere. (Indeed, topoi in general are
quite beautiful.)

	Dusko Pavlovic raises some interesting points - I just want to 
comment quickly on a couple of them. Firstly, it may be that (like those
annoying "semiconvergent" series in numerical analysis), attempts to
clarify something pass through a point of maximum simplicity after which
they get worse again.  Given all the indications that we can't have the 
kind of foundations that were once sought after (Goedel and All That), 
perhaps we are just looking for that point?
	The other comment addresses the idea that children use complex
grammatical structures without completely understanding them. Sure they
do - but they don't always use them *correctly*. Neither, of course, do
adults.  The trouble with mathematics is that unlike most of what we use
natural language for, its groundrules don't (despite certain recent articles)
permit statements on the 'well, it's mostly right and everybody knows what
I mean' level.   Most natural language usage jumps out of the system all
the time... which gets into the AI debate. In mathematics, the medium is much
closer to being the message.
	We try not to get into situations similar to the old chestnut
"Time flies like an arrow, while fruit flies like a banana." , supposed by
some to show that computers can't parse English. (I'm not sure that it does,
any more than if I say 'Professor Smith is visiting next week' and you
don't know whether to ask 'Is he?' or 'Is she?' , that shows that *you* 
don't know how to parse English...)  But natural languages do, because in
"natural" situations there is something outside the linguistic universe that
can be referred to usefully.

Dusko Pavlovic offers, in passing, several descriptions of category
theory:

  Yes, category theory is the discipline of conceptual mathematics: it
  helps us extract the relevant structure and discard the contingent.

  Categories provide means for analyzing complex situations into
  conceptual parts.

  Categories are about understanding. 

We know how to respond to students who tell us that they understand
the material but can't do the problems. So how does one respond to
this? I would suggest that any branch of mathematics is justified
finally only because it allows us to prove things previously
unprovable.

If we were restricted to doing things we understand I don't think we
would have gotten very far. Indeed, the most conspicuous function of
mathematics I know is that it allows us to do things we don't yet
understand. In my experience the feeling of understanding doesn't come
until after the problems are solved. And sometimes long after.

I think there are strong cases to be made for the presence of
categories in mathemamatics (beginning at least with the Adams
operations). And I think there are good cases to made even for the
_theory_ of categories in mathematics. But -- something none of us
expected -- the best cases to be made for the theory of categories are
not in mathematics but in applied areas. It is there that we are
finding the refutation of Dusko's sad assertion "now when it has
become clear that the dream of powerful, problem-solving category
theory won't come true."

introduction to categories in computer science.  We would 
like one that is self-contained in that it contains definitions 
and, if appropriate, examples for all categorical terms 
including those specialized to computer science.  We're looking 
primarily at applications in specification-based software 
synthesis, and design synthesis in general.

I do not remember the notion in Grothendieck's work, but the term 
princial fibration was extensively used with simplicial sets. the theory 
is very pretty and can be found in the survey by Curtis in Adv. in 
Maths. 6 (1971) 107 - 209.  Given the close connections between 
Simplicial sets and category theory this may provide a solution to your

The Latin of Peter Freyd's quotation from Diocletian may be translated:

To teach and exercise the art of geometry is in the public interest; the

The point, surely, is that in those days "mathematics" meant "astrology".
See Augustine, in The City of God, if I recall correctly. In the twelfth
century "Play of Daniel", as performed at Beauvais, when the writing on the

A propos the Diocletian quote, I support Max Kelly and John Isbell :

I do not like to jump in with both feet without seeing the locus and
its context, but I would say that the sense is

 "Surveying is generally acknowledged to be a social benefit but 
  astrology is everywhere taken to be pernicious"

"Geometria" at this time would have military overtones - design of
fortifications, disposal of forces over terrain etc. "Mathematicus"
almost certainly means "astrologer" or "soothsayer". Astrology was
not respectable, being seen as a vulgar oriental import. Two centuries
earlier, Juvenal in his sixth satire (line 562) says

 "Nemo mathematicus genium indemnatus habebit"

(No astrologer gets a reputation until he is convicted)

a line which the Diocletian quote could well be referring back to.

Sorry if this is a disappointment - but a nice quote anyhow!

Appearances might be misleading.  What precisely were the 
meanings of "geometria" and "mathematica" in Diocletian times?
I suspect that "geometria" encompassed what we would call the 
whole of mathematics as known then, while "mathematica" was a
branch of sorcery (benign as well as malign, ie. both white 
and black) that involved much high-fallutin' twiddling of 
symbols, mysterious diagrams and geometric figures, and such --
thus a kind of formalized abstract magick.  (Some recent 
literature on uses of category theory in computer science in 
general and in AI in particular would be basic manuals, as it 
were, for those mathematically inclined sorcerers.  They could 
use them quite effectively even if they would not understand what
it's all about, since they could always pretend they do, and they 
were masters of illusionism.)

Can somebody tell whether this is a good enough guess?

the reversion  r: I -> I  and the interchange  s: I^2 -> I^2  of the
standard topological case. Our study is mostly concerned with the Puppe
sequence of a map f and its comparison with the sequence of iterated
homotopy cokernels of f. As an application, the homotopy structure of
cochain algebras is studied in the present frame, through the cubical
co-monad of the path functor P and the left adjoint cylinder functor I.

This paper is a sequel of 
(*) "Cubical monads and their symmetries",
whose abstract appeared in "CATEGORIES", Mon, 4 Oct 1993.
