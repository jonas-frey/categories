***************************************************************************

With this posting the originating machine for categories changes (to
nimble.mta.ca [138.73.1.253].) It is hoped that the change will be
seamless, but please bear with us if there are some short-term glitches.
There is NO CHANGE in address for the list, nor in the
categories-request@mta.ca alias which should now be working. The only
changes you should notice are in the `From:' and `To:' fields of a
posting: 
- the `From:' field will now read `categories <cat-dist@mta.ca>'; 
- the `To:' field will now read `categories <categories@mta.ca>' (and not
your  personal address as has been the case.)

You may also note some other changes in the mail-header as you receive it.

This is a good time to remind you that a direct reply to a message from
categories goes to the list, NOT the originator of the message. Thus it
will be posted unless the moderator clearly understands a different
intent. 

Please inform me of any problems you experience. The usual routine
distribution follows. ( ... and Happy New Year to all.)

This is the routine distribution for the categories mailing list. It is the
file routine.dist in pub/categories at sun1.mta.ca and was last updated on
January 2, 1994.

Subscribers should note that the From: field of a categories posting is
categories <cat-dist@mta.ca> 
(this is different from some other mailing lists, and Usenet newsgroups.)
Thus if you reply directly to a posting it will be redirected to the
entire list (unless another intention is clearly detected by the
moderator). 

Administrative items (address changes etc.) can be sent to
categories-request@mta.ca 
or directly to the moderator. Usually, items of this sort sent to
categories@mta.ca will not be posted. 

The archives of postings on categories are held at the ftp site 
sun1.mta.ca        (138.73.16.12)
in the directory pub/categories. This is a Unix system.

The postings are filed in yearly subdirectories called 90, 91 etc. 
Within those subdirectories there are monthly files, and an annual list of
dates and subjects of postings.

In the pub/categories directory there is also a file called ftp.sites with 
information about ftp sites holding files of interest to subscribers. Several
TeX diagram macro packages are in the subdirectory macro. Information about
ftp sites with holdings of interest is solicited.

If you need detailed instructions on how to use ftp, ask anyone knowledgable 
about the Internet at your site, or write to me.

Dear Sir:

As much as I enjoyed reading ``The death of proof'' by John Hogan [October 
1993], I feel I should take exception to the statement attributed to Thurston
that Godel's incompleteness theorem implies that ``it is impossible to 
codify mathematics.''  This may be the view accepted by most mathematicians, 
and perhaps by Godel himself, but it depends on the assumption, implicit 
in Godel's argument, that the universe of mathematics (by this I mean 
whatever is described by the language of mathematics) obeys the following 
principle:  if a formula A(x) becomes true when x is replaced by a 
numeral S ... S0 (successor of ... successor of zero), then the universal 
statement `for all numbers x, A(x)' is true.  This principle is indeed
accepted by most mathematicians, but not by intuitionists, followers of 
L.E.J. Brouwer, who believe in the truth of the universal statement only if 
the special instances can be seen to be true in a way that is uniform as 
regards the number of times the successor symbol S appears.  How can such 
an intuitively evident principle fail to hold?  Well, intuitionists do accept
the following modified principle:  if the existential statement `for some 
number x, B(x)' is true, then some special instance B(S ... S0) must 
be true.  This looks very much like the principle they rejected, but the two 
principles are only equivalent according to the rules of classical, not 
intuitionistic, logic.

So, what is the universe of mathematics?  If we take the language of 
mathematics to be some form of intuitionistic type theory, we would hope 
that, among the models 
of this language, there is a preferred one, call it the 
universe of mathematics. Indeed, such a model can be constructed from the 
language itself, and it satisfies the above principle in its modified form.
That it does not satisfy the original principle is, in fact, what Godel
proved.  For classical type theory, no one has yet constructed a preferred
model, or any model for that matter, although many such models can be shown
to exist in the classical, but not intuitionistic, sense of ``existence.''

From: street@macadam.mpce.mq.edu.au

Dear CATEGORIES

Many of our kind colleagues have been concerned for the safety
of Sydney category theorists. I have had many enquiries by email
and phone.

We are all safe and without loss of personal property, to the best
of my knowledge. 

The fires have been the worst in New South Wales post european
settlement, as far as the area covered and number of fire fronts
at one time. Because of the remarkable efforts of the fire fighters
(many voluntary, from all over Australia & even some from New Zealand),
the death toll was kept down to around 5, including 2 fire fighters,
and there were 180 houses lost. Of course, there were many injuries
and other property losses. The Royal National Park south of Sydney
was 95% burnt; much will begin to regenerate with the next rain, but
many animals are dead and the rainforest regions will take 250 years
to return to the state they were in last week. The fire is still not
dead.

Last Thursday during lunch with Todd Trimble (our new Research Fellow
from Rutgers) at the Macquarie University Union we saw the beginning
of the fire in Lane Cove National Park. This was responsible for
the loss of many homes around South Turramurra, West Pymble, West 
Killara and West Pymble. During lunch with Todd on the Friday, helicopters
began taking water from a small lake near the Union building to
dump on the fire. Macquarie Centre (a nearby shopping mall) was 
evacuated on Friday evening as was the Graduate School of Management;
but these were all saved. The Kuring-gai Campus of the University of
Technology, Sydney, in Lindfield had considerable fire damage (my
wife, Margery, has done various courses there). Our Head of
School, the number theorist Alf van der Poorten, was one small block 
away from destroyed houses and bushland. This fire is essentially dead now.

The fire in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney rages on out of control,
but the efforts to save settlements by backburning and fire fighting have
mostly succeeded.

The fire in Kuring-gai National Park north of Sydney has charged back
and forth with the wind. It destroyed houses on the Pittwater 
Penninsula on Saturday during the westerly winds then headed back
south west with the change of wind on Sunday. Margery was working
Sunday afternoon at Belrose Library; as soon as she arrived (by a
non-standard route because of road closures just north of Max Kelly's
house on Mona Vale Road), Belrose hit the news as the centre of
activity. Luckily it stayed north of the Library. But the northern
parts of St Ives (Max's suburb), Turramurra (my suburb) and Wahroonga
(Bob Walter's suburb - Bob is in Milan, however) were warned to
prepare for evacuation. A large nursing home was evacuated. Cooler
conditions saved the day. The fire is still active. 

Yesterday there was some rain which hampered backburning efforts a
bit; it was not enough to put out fires, but the overcast conditions
and increased humidity helped. Today is still fairly cool (31 degrees
C predicted maximum for Sydney) and more humid.

Throughout it all, life goes on. In fact, life began. Another beautiful
daughter (9lb 12oz), Florence, arrived 'midst the flames on Friday for 
Dominic and Sally Verity.

Other personal news: Bart Jacobs is visiting Macquarie. His wife, Joke,
was here, but left last Friday returning to Utrecht. Awaiting her at
Amsterdam airport were reporters seeking news of the fires. Joke was
on Netherlands National TV. Also, Mike Johnson's student, Richard
Buckland is building a house in a little part of the Hawkesbury
River (north of Sydney) with only access by boat. Foundations, and
floorboards were in place. Last weekend he was going to put up
walls, and a lot of wood was at the site. He made several attempts
to visit the site over the weekend but was turned back. The good
news is that everything is untouched by fire, although it had gone
close.

Today (Tuesday) is now quite hazy and smokey. Hotter weather is
predicted. We are told not to become complacent.

Finally, I thought you might find of interest the following letter to 
the newspaper written by my (22 years old tomorrow) son, Arthur:

Sydney 2001}

\opening{Dear Editor,}

In the wake of the bushfires I was intrigued to see the media performing its
usual post-crisis contortions in an attempt to find people to blame for
the destruction.
I can't help but feel that no matter how much we backburn
and no matter how draconian the penalties for flicking cigarette butts out
car windows, bushfires are inevitable and always have been.
As was mentioned by the {\em Herald} recently, Captain Cook was
flabbergasted by the number of fires he saw raging up and down the east
coast of Australia.

Therefore I propose that, rather than blaming individuals and dare I say
the greenies, we should blame our forebears for imposing on this
`continent of fire' a foreign culture not suited to the conditions.
Instead of concreting over the last of our urban bushland, which no doubt
some development-motivated doom-mongers will be advocating,
the housing developments at the fringes of Sydney should be built to
withstand the worst of our bushfires. Perhaps they could be built largely
underground, which would also provide a cheap form of temperature control.
Who knows, if it were to catch on, the resulting unique
architecture could help to forge the Australian identity of the 21st
century.

\closing{Yours sincerely,}
\end{letter}

In the category of chain complexes (over some abelian category)
it is clear that if you identify homotopic arrows, you will also
invert homotopy equivalences.  Does anyone know if the converse is 
true?  If you invert homotopy equivalences, do you wind up identifying
homotopic arrows?  What if you replace homotopy by homology?  Does
inverting maps that induce isomorphism on homology have the effect of
identifying maps that induce the same map on homology?

This message concerns the idea that one could carry out the
usual construction in classical logic of formulas, terms,
theories, interpretations, and so on in a suitable category that
has recursion.  Formulas, terms and proofs are all inductively
defined, after all.  For example, one might have an object of
formulas that is the solution of a recursion problem and an
arrow "interpretation" (also the solution of a recursion
equation) from that object to a category object.

I believe I recently saw a paper that does something like this,
but I can't remember it and can't find it.  Although I saw it
recently, it may not be a recent paper; I believe I came across
it in the process of accumulating papers for my outline of
sketches.

Anyone know of any work like this?

Strictly epic families (of morphisms with common codomain) are used in
SGA4. I used them again in my paper with Reinhard Boerger in the Cahiers
(vol 32, 1991, pp257ff) which contains exact definitions and a bit of
discussion. In the case of singleton families, these are regular epis
in the sense of Gabriel-Ulmer and of Kelly.
I hope that this answers Thomas Streicher's question.

It is, to my knowledge standard and is identical to extremal epi or
extremal epimorphic family.  For one, it means it factors through no
proper subobject of the codomain.  For a family, all with the same
codomain, it means there is no proper subobject of the codomain
that factors all of them.  In a regular category, a strict epi is
regular.  In a wide complete category (every class of subobjects has
an intersection), a strict epi is in a certain sense a composite
of a class of regular epis.  You may need cokernel pairs to do that.
I don't know any such simple characterization for families.

Hmm, not quite sure, but in the book "Category Theory, An Introduction" by
H. Herrlich and G. Strecker there is a definition of strict mono in the
exercises. 

According to this text a strict  monomorphism is a morphism $f$ such that:
whenever $h$ is a morphism with the property that for all morphisms
$r$ and $s$, $r\circ f= s\circ f$ implies that $r\circ h=s\circ h$, then
there exists a unique morphism $k$ such that $h=f\circ k$. Probably you get
a strict epi if you modify the condition according to the property of
epimorphisms being righ-cancellable instead of left-cancellable.

There was no reference to "strict monomorphic family" :(

 I am very much in favor of constructive logic in the sense of proof in
lieu of truth.  This replaces truth-valued entailments, that is,
implication as a preordering of propositions, with set-valued
entailments, that is, implication as homsets whose elements are
interpreted as proofs, or moves in a space of perspectives.  This
branch of logic is a rich application area for category theory, whose
cartesian closed fragment is nicely developed in Jim and Phil's book.

 To the same degree, I am opposed to the mysticism implicit in the
traditional "it may sound the same but it's provably different" defense
of propositional intuitionism.  Goedel defused this argument along
lines that can be made quite pragmatic as follows.

 Intuitionistic arithmetic is just classical arithmetic with some
"surely"'s strategically placed in the wording of some theorems, where
"surely" abbreviates "not not".  Real-world customers of mathematics
pay no attention to these "surely"'s, for the simple reason that, while
they know full well what to do with the theorems, they have no idea to
what use to put the "surely"'s.  No engineering project has ever been
made one whit more hazardous by casual neglect of "surely"'s appearing
in its intuitionistically correct arithmetic.  Deriving those theorems
classically yields no more than what can be obtained by treating all
the "surely"'s in the intuitionistic derivations as noise words to be
ignored.

 From the point of view of correctness then, "surely" is merely harmless.

 From a computational point of view a marginally more concrete statement
is possible.  Dropping "surely" from pure propositional logic reduces
the computational complexity of its satisfiability problem from
PSPACE-complete (Statman) to NP-complete (Cook).  Thus "surely," and
hence intuitionism in the permitted-middle sense, does nothing to
render the propositional content of an argument any easier to follow,
and may well make it harder.

 If Jim has something more constructive in mind than this, e.g. along
the lines of categorial logic, it would be nice to understand the
details.  In a suitable setting for example, it may be possible to
imbue "surely" with enough real-world significance to change the
practical import of arithmetic statements using it.

 I maintain that any defense of this brand of intuitionism can be
clarified, and hence made more convincing, by phrasing it as a
raison-d'etre for "surely," or double negation, which, as Goedel was
the first to see, conveniently localizes the significance of
intuitionism by presenting it as an expansion of the language of
classical logic with a unary operator.

In reply to Mike Barr's question, think of a cylinder generating the 
homotopy.  The inclusions into the two ends are homotopy equivalences. 
(There are various cylinders possible; one due to Kleisi some years 
back.) Invert the homotopy equivalences and homotopic maps become 
identified.  This was discussed in detail and more generality in 
Grothendieck's Pursuing Stacks.

Happy New Year to all and sundry,

-Does anybody know what is meant by "strict epi" or "strict epimorphic  
-family" ?
-Maybe it's standard but I couldn't find it in any book available to  
-me !

-Thomas Streicher

 For a category which has fiber products the definition looks as follows
(there are LATEX notations below). 
 A family of morphisms $\{f_i:X_i\rightarrow Y\}$ in a category $C$ is
called a stric epimorphic family if for any object $Z$ in $C$ the 
set $Hom(X,Z)$ is the equalizer of the maps $\prod_i
Hom(X_i,Z)\rightarrow \prod_{i,j} Hom(X_i\times_Y X_j,Z)$ induced by the
projections. 
 If $C$ does not have fiber products one has in the definition above to
replace $X_i\times_Y X_j$ by the fiber product of the corresponding
representable functors and to consider morphisms in the category of
functors from $C^{op}$ to $Sets$ (taking $Z$ to be a representable
functor).

 A more sophisticated way to say the same thing is to say that a strict
epimorphic family is a covering family in the canonical topology on $C$.
All this should be in SGA4 and the definition for categories with fiber
products should be in SGA1.

-In the category of chain complexes (over some abelian category)
-it is clear that if you identify homotopic arrows, you will also
-invert homotopy equivalences.  Does anyone know if the converse is 
-true?  If you invert homotopy equivalences, do you wind up identifying
-homotopic arrows?  What if you replace homotopy by homology?  Does
-inverting maps that induce isomorphism on homology have the effect of
-identifying maps that induce the same map on homology?

-Michael


 The answer to the first question I guess is positive (and we do not
need the original category to be abelian - just additive). The proof should
look as follows. Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism which is homotopic
to zero. We have to show that it is zero in the category localized with
respect to homotopy equivalences. It follows from the fact that it can
be factorized through the cone of the identity morphism $X\rightarrow X$
which is homotopy equivalent to zero.
The answer to the second one is most definitely negative. In fact the
statement is true if and only if the original abelian category is
semi-simple. The localization with respect to "homological equivalences"
i.e. quasi-isomorphisms is the derived category. Any extension in the
original abelian category gives us a morphism in the derived one which
is zero on (co)homology.

From: Axel Poigne <poigne@gmd.de>

I yesterday attended a talk about fuzzy logic (I know this to be
``degoutant'', but...) where a ``Lukaciewicz norm'' was discussed as a
t-norm. 

If I recollect correctly, a t-norm is a has a binary operator _\wedge_
which is associative, commutative, and monotonic, the latter being a
mystery, the order being due to the real interval [0,1]. Moreover it seems
that a negation \neg is assumed to exist, since an operator \vee is
defined by de Morgan law. Quite clearly, min determines a norm as well as
the multiplication. It seems to be an assumption that negation is always
\neg a = 1-a. 

Now the Lukaciewicz norm is of the form a \wedge b = min{a + b, 1}. As
consequence, a \vee b = max{a + b - 1, 0}. This norm satisfies a \wegde
\neg a = 0 and a \vee \neg a = 1, but \vee and \wedge are not
distributive, which is true for the other norms. (I hope this to be a
correct recollection of what I heard)

Trying to make head and tail of this, I wonder whether one really should
say that one has a lower semi-lattice for the order, or even an Heyting
algebra (in fact the \sqcap and \bigsqcup is about in all the arguments),
and just add a binary monotonic, etc operator _ \otimes _ (replacing the
\wedge in the t-norm). This structure rather looks like a quantale (units
are available as well). I have no idea how negation fits the picture, but
it reminds me of classical linear logic. 

Does this ring a bell ? I am just puzzled, having no idea about fuzzy
logic, and little knowlege about linear logic. I know that Michael Barr
has written a paper on Fuzzy sets as toposes but he uses only geometric
logic, meaning a Heyting algebra. 


Axel

A related question : these people seem to use \bigsqcup in general to
compute suprema. It appears to be more consistent to use \bigoplus on
occasions. How would this be defined in linear logic ? (Sorry, my linear
logic is very poor)

This is an appeal for help to my friends and acquaintances on
CATEGORIES:

I have been enlisted to give a talk on "Fuzzy vs. Probability
Theory" to an audience in finance whose backgrounds include
applied mathematics, physics, engineering, and finance.  The
audience is not familiar with categories, no less toposes, which
means that subtleties such as adding fuzzy equality to yield
variable sets (sheaves) would be lost.  Nevertheless, they are
intrigued by the "fuzzy stuff" that is currently popular.

My predicament is then to choose between:

(1) torturing my conscience by giving an insubstantial and
    superficial talk on memberships vs distribution functions;

(2) torturing the underlying mathematics into layman's prose.

I am hoping that some of the learned readers of CATEGORIES may
have already performed torture # 2 in a humane fashion (either in
public or in private) and have some material and/or suggestions
on how best to commit this heinous act.

My preferred approach would be a la M. Barr via variable sets and
sheaves, combined with the description of fuzzy and probabilistic
algebraic theories given by E. Manes.  I am already aware of many
other fine (and some not so fine) works on fuzzy  sets and fuzzy
logic, however, I don't know how to make these understandable to
non-categorists.  I may well have to resort to torture # 1, but
would like to avoid doing so if possible.

All comments and suggestions, either privately to me at
vilcius@clid.yorku.ca or publicly on CATEGORIES, on how I could
have my "coffee crisp" would be most welcome.

Thank you ............................... Al Vilcius, Toronto

I wonder whether the following trivial observation is generally known  
:

a category  C  with finite products is WEAKLY CARTESIAN CLOSED  iff   
for all objects  A , B  in  C  the functor  C( _ x A , B) is a  
retract of a representable functor.

(The embedding part of the retraction gives a choice of functional  
abstraction which is stable under substitution) and the projection  
part gives evaluation).

Especially this entails that if  C  has splitting of idempotents then  
the notions of cartesian closedness and weakly cartesian closedness  
are equivalent.


I don't think that the remark above is a deep insight !!
BUT usually people refer to the quite heavy machinery of Hayashi's  
semifunctors when they speak about the categorical semantics of typed  
lambda calculus without eta-rule.

Pierre Ageron asked (way back on 1 Dec):

  The statement and the AC-free proof of Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein's theorem
  have obviously some categorical content. Has this been already investigated ?

The property, when it holds, is an important property on the category. It is,
however, a rare property. 

There are, as usual, different ways to interpret the property in general
categories. I would opt for the following:

CANTOR-SCHROEDER-BERNSTEIN PROPERTY: If two objects be retracts of each other 
they are necessarily isomorphic.

I trust that CSB holds for any boolean topos. (Anyone want to confirm?)

Kaplansky in his booklet on infinite abelian groups pointed out that CSB holds
in the category of countable torsion abelian groups (as a consequence of the
Ulm invariants). He raised it as one of three test problems for advances in
the theory of abelian groups. Does CSB continue to hold, for example,  if
countablility is dropped? (Kaplansky did not, of course, talk about retracts.
He talked about two groups appearing as direct summands of each other.)
Someone found a counterexample in the latter 50's. (Anybody know who?)

If  _A_  and  _B_  are categories, _A_  a retract of  _B_, it is routine that
a counterexample for CSB in  _A_  is transported to a countexample in  _B_.
_Abelian_Groups_  is a retract of  _Topological_Spaces_ (via Moore spaces and
homology) hence there are a pair of spaces which appear as retracts of each
other but are different enough to have different homology groups. That fact
became better known in the late 50's than the fact about abelian groups. (And 
in the late 50's it was damned difficult to explain why it should be viewed
as a trivial corollary.)

There's a stronger property: if two objects be retracts of each other the 
retraction maps are isomorphisms.

The two most immediate examples are the categories of finite sets and of
finite dimensional vectors spaces.  But note that any category that is 
locally finite (i.e. all hom-sets are finite)--or any linear category that
is locally finite dimensional--immediately inherits the property. By moving
to a 2-category setting one may state the obvious general theorem of 
which these are special cases.

I am not sure if any of this should be viewed as having "categorical content."

best thoughts,
  peter

Does anyone know a syntactic criterion for the existence of a natural
transformation join : TTA -> TA for a given endofunction T built from
+, *, -> ?

There is a well-known (correct me if I'm wrong) syntactic criterion
for covariance which determines whether T can be extended to an
endofunctor.  Can this criterion be extended to the existence of join?

Also, does anyone know a reference for the covariance criterion?

One thing to say is that I did not write a paper on fuzzy sets as toposes,
but someone named Eytan did.  I wrote a paper on fuzzy sets as non-toposes
and it differs from Eytan's in being correct.  On the other hand, fuzzy
sets are a quasi topos, which means they do have a first order logic.  
That said, it has to admitted that the first order logic is probably not
what they really had in mind as fuzzy logic and what they did have in
mind (using operators like truncated sum and negations like - minus is
closer to linear logic than to classical, even intuitionistic classical,
logic.  I once started to write a paper on this, but have not completed
it it; maybe one day I will.  And, BTW, Andy Pitts, unbeknownst to me,
also once wrote a paper on fuzzy sets as a non-topos.  His is also correct.

I have a related predicament.  I'm an industrial mathematician with a 
need to learn what I can as soon as possible about a mathematical 
background for fuzzy logic.  I am also furiously learning what I can 
about category theory and logic in connection with some work in formal 
methods for software engineering and machine learning (neural networks).  
So I really need to find an appropriate, no-nonsense (i.e., mathematical) 
formalism that meets all these requirements; given that, I can afford to 
invest considerable effort learning it.  My current choice is to study 
categorical or category-related theories, and am currently reading up 
on Steven Vickers' work on topological systems as well as Goguen and 
Burstalls' work on institutions.  If anybody has information that might 
help, or could elaborate on your reply to Al Vilcius so that a categorical 
novice might understand as well, I would be most grateful.  I did study 
topology and algebra in grad school many years ago.

From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.Math.McGill.CA>

There have been two apparently quite different categorical versions of
acyclic models.  The first, as found for example in Barr-Beck, COCA,
1966, says that if K = {Kn}, augmented over K(-1) and similarly L were
chain complex functors and G is a cotriple such that (Kn)epsilon:  (Kn)G
--> Kn has a natural splitting when n >= 0 and if the complex LG -->
L(-1)G --> 0 has a natural contracting homotopy, then any natural
transformation K(-1) --> L(-1) can be extended to a unique up to
homotopy map K --> L. In many cases the required naturality is too hard
to verify (or false) and so a second form of the theorem is used.  Here
we simply suppose that the complex (Kn)G* --> Kn --> 0 is acyclic (an
easy consequence of the splitting above), that LG --> L(-1)G --> 0 is
acyclic and that K(-1) is isomorphic to L(-1) and conclude that H(K) is
isomorphic to H(L).  (Kn)G* stands for the standard powers-of-G
resolution coming from eps.  This version is easy to apply, but suffers
from three defects.  First, it works only in the case of isomorphism,
not arbitrary maps.  Second, it does not in itself give naturality,
although that could probably be remedied by using a category of
relations.  Third, and probably most important, it gives no uniqueness.
This means, for example, that although you can use it (in conjunction
with an argument involving simplicial subdivision) to show that singular
and simplicial homology of triangulated spaces are isomorphic, you
cannot show this way that the isomorphism is induced by the inclusion of
the simplicial chains into the singular ones.
 
I have recently discovered a version of acyclic models that repairs all
three defects.  Moreover, it gives a single proof of both forms as well
as third form involving what I will call weak homotopy equivalence.
(This is not a Quillen model category in general, although there would
appear to be considerable overlap.)  Let C be the category of
chain complexes of functors from some category X to an abelian category
A.  Say that an arrow K --> L in C is a weak homotopy equivalence if for
each object x of X, Kx --> Lx is a homotopy equivalence (has a homotopy
inverse and homotopies, etc., but not assumed natural).  Let Sigma stand
for one of the classes:
 
(a) homotopy equivalences
 
(b) weak homotopy equivalences
 
(c) homology isomorphisms
 
and let D denote the category of fractions gotten from C by inverting
Sigma.  Let (G,eps) be a pair consisting of an endofunctor on X and a
natural transformation G --> Id.  Say that the augmented object K -->
K(-1) --> 0 of C is Sigma-trivial if the 0 endomorphism is in Sigma.
Say that the object K of C is G presentable (w.r. to Sigma) if for each
n >= 0, the chain complex (Kn)G* --> Kn --> 0 is Sigma-trivial and K is
G acyclic (w.r. to Sigma) if KG --> K(-1)G --> 0 is Sigma-trivial.  Then
 
Theorem: If K is G presentable and L is G acyclic, both w.r. to Sigma,
then any natural transformation K(-1) --> L(-1) can be extended in D to
an arrow, unique in D, K --> L.
 
In case (a), this is the theorem of Barr-Beck, 1966 and in case (c),
this repairs the three defects cited above, while case (b) appears to be
genuinely new.
 
The proof is embarrassingly easy.  Consider the diagram
                  (alpha K)G*      K(eps*)
         K(-1)G* <----------- KG* ---------> K
            |
            |
            |
            |
            v     (alpha L)G*      L(eps*)
         L(-1)G* <----------- LG* ---------> L
alpha K and alpha L are the augmentation arrows.  The G-presentability
implies that K(eps*) is in Sigma and the G-acyclicity that (alpha L)G*
is.  When these are inverted, we get the desired map K --> L as the
composite.  A paper on the subject will be posted in the usual ftp
location within a week or two.

One additional example and you don't even need retracts.  In the category
of finitely generated modules over a commutative ring, all epis are
isos.  As a result, if you have epis in both directions, they are
isos.  So the dual category category is S-B.  This is fairly
easy if the ring has ACC, but there is a trick that works for any
ring to reduce it to that case.  Since f.d. vector spaces are self-dual,
this example encompasses that one.

I cannot say about "generally known", but..

this property it is quoted as one of the elementary characterizations of wCCC
in a paper of mine (Categorical Models for non-extensional lambda-calculi,
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science (1992), vol 2, pag 327--357).

The paper, which has a definite didactic pace, discusses also the
case where there is only an epy natural transformation from C(_,A=>B) to 
C( _ x A , B), which gives models of typed, non extensional, Combinatory
Logic; and it gives conditions on the existence of models of
type-free lambda-calculus as reflexive objects in wCCCs.

Yes, this is the "degenerate" case of a semi-adjunction between a functor G
and a semi-functor F: the semi-isomorphism 

	     D(F(-), ...) \cong_{s} C(-, G(...))

becomes a retraction (see [1], also [2]).

However, if the products of your typed lambda calculus also do not satisfy
the eta-rule, the semi-isomorphism above does not degenerate, and it is 
less obvious how to give a simple characterization without semi-functors (apart
from saying that the Karoubi envelope of the category is Cartesian closed).

In my thesis "Structure des logiques et logique des structures", I tried (very 
shortly) to understand what the algebraic and categorical counterparts of 
fuzzy logic are. 
There are different proposals in the literature, the reason is that there
are plenty of interesting operations on the interval [0,1] and that it is very 
difficult  to tell which ones are relevant for fuzzy logic. The most general 
axiomatization was given by Rene Guitart in his 1979 thesis (or a  1982
paper in the Cahiers). He considered complete ordered abelian monoids (in 
their 1990 book, Barr and Wells restricted to complete Heyting algebras).
I observed that every complete ordered abelian monoid has a canonical 
Lafont algebra structure: this means that (this) fuzzy logic is the extension
of intuitionistic linear logic with infinitary versions of the additive
connectives "plus" and "with".
Guitart defined the notion of "algebraic universe": essentially a category
equipped with a monad P looking like the monad of subsets on Ens (I mean 
Set !). This notion subsumes the notion of elementary topos and allows
to give higher order semantics for logics other than intuitionistic logic.
In the case of fuzzy logic, the point is that every complete ordered abelian 
monoid defines such a structure on Ens. The Kleisli category of P is the 
category of fuzzy relations. All this is explained in my thesis using 
the notations of linear logic. 
All that framework gives Tarskian semantics for (propositional or 
higher order) fuzzy logic. It is not clear whether there are Heytingian
semantics for fuzzy logic, i.e. a proof theory. The difficulty is that
every small complete category is a poset (but this result by Freyd uses
AC, so hope remains...)

This is about the opposite of category theory. I'm going to give
a soft proof of something and ask how to get the hard proof.  All
of this because of Mike Barr's note about modules of commutative rings.

Let  M  be a finitely presented module over a commutative ring  R
and  f:M -> M  an epimorphic endomorphism.  We will show that
f is necessarily an isomorphism.  First specialize to the case that
R is Noetherian.  The kernels of the powers of  f  form an ascending
chain of submodules of  M, hence must stabalize.  That is, there
                                        k+1        k           k+1
is a natural number  k  such that  Ker(f   )= Ker(f ). Since  f    is
epi, it is a cokernel for its kernel and there must exist  g:M -> M
            k+1     k
such that  f   g = f .  (I'm composing maps in the diagramatic order.)
Using for the second time that  f  is epi we may cancel to obtain
fg = 1.  Since  fgf = f1  we cancel once more (using that  f  is epi
for the third time) to obtain  gf = 1.

Now, let  r  and  n  be natural numbers and  
                     r      n   
                    R  ->  R  ->  M  -> O

an exact sequence. There must be an  rxn  matrix  K, an  rxr  matrix  
A'  an  nxn  matrix  A, another  nxn  matrix  B, and an  nxr  matrix  
C such that  
                KA = A'K
                BA + CK  =  I.        (K  describes the map
       r      n                                                      n
from  R  to  R  that defines  M,  A  describes the endomorphism on  R
                                                      r
that "lifts"  f,  A'  describes the endomorphsim on  R . Since  f  is
              n+r        n 
epi the map  R      ->  R     obtained by stacking  A  and  K  is also
                                         n     n+r
epi, hence it has a left-inverse  (B,C):R  -> R  .)

Specialize to the case that  R  is the the "generic ring",
that is the ring generated by the  2nn+2nr+rr  entries of  K,A,A',B,C
with  nr+nn  equations. We may infer that there is an
rxr  matrix  X  and an  nxr  matrix  Y  such that  
        KB = XK
        AB + YK = I.
The entries of  X  and  Y  are necessarily given by polynomials in
the generating "variables" and the last two matrix equations must 
result in  rr+nr  equations that are direct consequences of the 
nr+nn  defining equations.  Hence the original theorem works for any
finitely presented module over any commutative ring.

Now for the hard part: what are these polynomials?  In the case  n = 1
its easy (and reveals quickly the need for commutativity).
Try it for  n=2, r=1. Given:
  ac+be = ga
  ad+bf = gb
  hc+ie+la = 1
  hd+if+lb = 0
  jc+ke+ma = 0
  jd+kf+mb = 1
find, for a start, a polynomial on these variables, x,  such that
  ah+bj = xa
  ai+bk = xb.

I will try to recall the argument (on-line).
Given an epi-endomorphism f, look at the ascending chain ker(f),
ker(f^2), ker(f^3),....  In the noetherian case, this stabilizes so
that ker(f^n) = ker(f^{n+1}).  Assume thatn is as small as possible,
so that ker(f^{n-1}) < ker(f^n).  Choose an element x in the ker of
f^n, not in the lesser one.  x = f(y) for some y, since f is onto.
0 = f^n(x) = f^{n+1}(y), so that 0 = f^{n}(y) = f^{n-1}(x), a
contradiction.  That takes care of the noetherian case and doesn't
even use commutativity, it would seem.  For the general case,
suppose R is the ring, M the module, f: M --> M the endomorphism and
x an element with f(x) = 0.  Now pick a set of generators for M, say
y_1,...,y_n.  What you have to do is to find a suitable finite
subset of R, with just the right elements in it to express all the
f(y_i), x and at least one preimage of each y_i as linear
combinations of the y_i using coefficients from that subset.  Now
let S be the subring of R generated by that finite set of elements
and N be the least S-submodule of M containing all the y_i.  If I
have left anything required out of S, add that too.  Anyway, S is
noetherian (this does use commutativity, I believe) and f induces a
counter-example on N.

I believe this argument is due to one of the Rutgers people like
Faith or Osofsky, but I am far from certain of that.  It will be
true for PI rings if affine PI rings have acc on left ideals.  For
commutative rings it is essentially the Hilbert basis theorem.

I've done quite a lot of work on categories of fuzzy sets.  The main paper 
is in the volume edited by H\"ohle and Rodabaugh referred to earlier.

Barr is correst that fuzzy sets form a quasitopos, but the logic of that
quasitopos is that of the underlying set category, hence not interesting 
as a place to do fuzzy mathematics.  The fuzzy connectives come from a 
second monoidal closed structure obtainable from, for example, the t-norms
usually referred to in the fuzzy literature.  This gives a very satisfactory
logic if one uses what I called unballanced subobjects (the map involved is
both monic and epic).  There is a weak representor for these subobjects 
(representation is not unique though there is an ordering on maps which
allows a canonical choice of representative to be made) allowing an internal
representation of a large fragment of higher order fuzzy logic.  

I have a more recent paper (to appear in the proceedings of the 1992 Linz 
seminar, being published by Kluwer sometime later this year) in which I look at categories of fuzzy sets with values in a Quantale or Projectale.  That paper is
available from me by e-mail (I don't have ftp facilities available).  It
includes a characterization of categories of fuzzy sets in terms of the 
representability of the logic and the property of being topological over 
Sets.

I think this would traditionally be described as a "finite discrete
opfibration (over Bij)". The functors corresponding to condition (i)
are discrete opfibrations, and the finite comes from condition (ii).
Neither of these uses any special property of Bij (such as the fact
that it is a groupoid). It might be more modern to use "cofibration"
instead of "opfibration". See Barr & Wells "Toposes, Triples and
Theories" p231 ex [OPF] for more conventional definitions, and perhaps
Benabou "Fibred categories and the foundations of naive category
theory" (J. Symbolic Logic (50) No. 1, 1985, 10-37) for more of an
indication of why these sorts of structures are so common.

Another way of looking at the structure would be to turn it around and 
say that you have a functor G: Bij -> FiniteSet given on objects by 
G(t) = F^{-1}(t). 

best wishes,
Edmund Robinson

For human readers (and after all, is this message _ever_ going to be
presented to a Latex interpreter?) most of the $'s and \'s here are not
only completely unnecessary, but, worse, a positive barrier to
understanding.

I would expect - but this is something that can be put to the test - that
even people completely familiar with Latex would find it easier to read the
following version. It certainly involves less typing.

>    (ii) For t in Bij, F^{-1}(t) is an (effectively

(I have ignored the puzzle of whether {\bf ...} is mathematically
meaningful - in the original $S$ turns into ${\bf S}$. If it _is_
mathematically meaningful, then in Latex it should be macroized.)

Steve Vickers.

p.s. Having rephrased the question, I still don't know the answer - sorry.

With regard to the remarks of Barr and Freyd on surjective endomorphisms
of finitely generated modules:  I haven't digested those remarks, but here
is a slick proof of the result, communicated to me years ago by Bill
Waterhouse (instead of reduction to the Noetherian case, it uses
localization):

It is enough to prove bijectivity at all localizations, so we can assume
that the commutative ring A is local with maximal ideal m.  Given a
surjective endomorphism f of a finitely generated A-module M, let F be a
finitely generated free A-module mapping onto M so that the mapping
induces an isomorphism  F/mF ----> M/mM.  Let  K = Ker(F ---> M).  f then
lifts to an endomorphism g of F, which is an isomorphism because it is
so mod m.  Then g(K) is contained in K, and to prove f is bijective we
need only show g'(K) is likewise contained in K (with g' the inverse of g).
But g satisfies its characteristic polynomial, which has invertible constant
term det(g) (up to sign); thus g' is a polynomial in g and so maps K into
itself.

I haven't seen this proof in the literature.  However, the following
related reference might be of interest: M. Orzech, L. Ribes, "Residual
finiteness and the Hopf property in rings", J. Algebra 15 (1970), 81-88.

Sincerely,
Steve Chase

I certainly agree with Steve's point. But I would go further:

 Define a ?????? to be a pair (*S*, F) consisting of a category  *S*  and

 a functor  F  from  *S*  to  *Bij*  , the category of finite

 sets and bijections, satisfying -

     (i) If  F(S ) = T  and  f:T -> T' , then there exists a

 unique object  S'  in  *S*  and a unique morphism

 g: S -> S'  such that  F(g) = f.

    (ii) For  T   in  *Bij*,  F (T)  is an (effectively

 computable) finite set.

But: I must confess that I also experience a little "heartsink" when I 
see a list of addresses as long as that above.

best thoughts, 
  peter

Yes, I certainly do, and much prefer the "humanized" alternative:

Thank you to all those who responded, including those who pointed
out my e-faux pas.  Incidently,  the complaint about  S  versus {\bf S}
alerted me to a typo in a paper under preparation (these should have
been the same) and so I am especially grateful for that.
