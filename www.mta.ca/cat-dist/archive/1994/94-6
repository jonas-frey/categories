Subject: limits and colimits of enriched categories 

Date: Tue, 31 May 94 22:31:33 PDT
From: john baez <baez@ucrmath.UCR.EDU>

In Kelly's book on enriched category theory, he seems to claim
that it would be easy to prove that if K is a symmetric monoidal
closed category in which all small diagrams have limits and colimits,
then in the category of small K-categories it is also true that
all small diagrams have limits and colimits, but he does not
actually prove this.  Does anyone know a reference for a proof
of this fact?

Subject: Name change for PSSL? 

Date: Thu, 2 Jun 94 10:33:00 BST
From: John Power <ajp@dcs.ed.ac.uk>


Dear Colleagues,
		I have been inundated with mail about a proposed
name change for the "Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic".
I would like to make two points:

1 several people seem to be pressing a "reply" button and
thereby communicating their response with the rest of the world. I
suggest you send them only to me unless you specifically want
them distributed worldwide: I will acknowledge receipt of each,
and I am collecting them all to pass to Dana in due course for
a decision.

2 so far, the great majority of replies want to retain the current
name. I humbly submit that some may not be taking the concern
sufficiently seriously. I organized the last meeting, and some
intelligent, very interesting people in closely related areas felt the
meeting would be irrelevant to them because of the name. Of those, I
convinced some to attend, but even then, they did so skeptically.
Others evidently thought I misrepresented the nature of the meeting
and did not come. Presumably, others did not attend but did not tell
me their concerns.  It seems to me that it is of fundamental
importance that such a seminar welcome new intelligent interesting
people in closely related areas: so if we are not to change the name, I
suggest people send alternative suggestions to resolve the problem.

	All the best,
		John.

I would like to go on record as suggesting the same name for the PSSL.
I think "logic" covers a lot of ground and don't like the idea of
replacing part of a name on the grounds that it will "put some people
off". Personally I think "sheaves" in the general context it is used
in the name of the seminar is relevant to computer science.

Ross is too modest, the theorem he proves there is a tad stronger: if K
has all J-limits for a small diagram J then so does K-Cat.  K should be
symmetric monoidal but need not be closed and needs no limits or
colimits beyond those implied by the existence of all J-limits.

I see that Casley has answered the query of Baez on the completeness
and cocompleteness of V-Cat by giving the reference to the Betti, Carboni,
Strret, Walters paper "Variation through enrichment" in JPAA 29 (1983),
109-127. That is a fine reference, and everyone should read that paper;
but it was of course not my reason for believing the result at the time of
writing my book, published in 1982 but available earlier as a preprint.
The result that V-Cat is complete and cocomplete when V is so is much
older, and is due to Harvey Wolff, J.Pure Appl. Algebra 4 (1974), 123-135.
The paper of Betti et al. does indeed mention this reference - but some y
younger colleagues may be unaware of the details of Wolff's contribution.

I would have thought that the standard reference to the cocompleteness
of V-Cat was
	Harvey Wolff, V-cat and V-graph, J. Pure and Applied Alg, 
	4(1974) 123-135.

He shows that if V is cocomplete, then so is V-cat, by showing that
V-cat is monadic over V-graph, that V-graph is cocomplete and then 
quoting a result of Linton in
	F. E. J. Linton, Coequalizers in categories of algebras, in
	Lecture Notes in Math. 80, Springer-Verlag 1969, 75-90.

His main application is the existence of localizations in the V case.

Wolff assumes that V is a symmetric monoidal closed category. The existence
of the free functor from V-graph to V-cat requires that tensor commute
with coproducts, and the existence of coequalizers in V-cat seems to
require that tensor commute with coequalizers, so closedness apparently
is essential, at least for this form of the argument. He doesn't say
anything about the existence of limits in V-cat.

Subject: New release of XY-pic diagram drawing macros 

Date: Thu, 9 Jun 1994 17:42:43 +0200
From: kris@diku.dk

Dear fellow diagram drawers and TeX users!

This is to announce the release of a new version of my DIAGRAM DRAWING
PACKAGE, XY-pic: version 2.9.  In particular this version represents
the stage where XY-pic 3 has left ALPHA test (and entered BETA
confidence test) and the kernel should be stable.

The release is mainly a BUG FIX RELEASE fixing several problems
reported in version 2.7 and 2.8 by users; in addition it ADDS THESE
NEW FEATURES:

* The speed of diagram typesetting has been increased back closer to
  the version 2.6 speed, faster for very large diagrams.

* The set up of the style of \arrow command must now be clearly
  marked.

* It is possible to `compile' large diagrams (with some restrictions)
  to a file such that retypesetting is faster still.

* Options can now be loaded safely in any order.

* The bug that required removal of \\ before \enddiagram has been
  fixed.

* The PostScript backend by Ross Moore has been greatly enhanced and
  now supports varying line thickness, colour, rotation, and scaling.

* There is a new feature by Ross Moore: \xyoption{2cell} loads special
  commands typesetting pairs and triples of curved arrows like
  categorical two-cells.

Below I have attached the TRAILER of the package that gives some more
details and explains how to obtain it; the version packaged specially
for the Apple Macintosh by Ross Moore will be available shortly.

Regards,
	 Kristoffer Rose		(.signature at end of TRAILER)

======================================================================
TRAILER: ANNOUNCING the XY-pic version 2.9 DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE
======================================================================

XY-pic is a package for typesetting a variety of graphs and diagrams
within TeX that works with most formats (including LaTeX 2.09, LaTeX2e,
AMS-LaTeX, AMS-TeX, and plain TeX).  In particular XY-pic is provided
as a LaTeX2e `package'.

NOTE: version 2.9 is a final BETA CONFIDENCE TEST release of XY-pic 3
in the sense that it is likely to contain minor bugs in both
documentation and code but should be stable.  If you are a user of an
earlier version of XY-pic then PLEASE TEST this release with your
existing diagrams and REPORT PROBLEMS you encounter to the authors!

The intention remains to maintain full backwards compatibility with
XY-pic 2 but we need feed-back from users in order to achieve this
goal (see `The future and backwards compatibility' in the User's Guide
for the unavoidable exceptions).

Version 2.9 is the final result of the effort this springs to outline
XY-pic 3 in collaboration with Ross Moore while visiting Macquarie U,
Sydney: The package has been restructured and extended into a kernel
and several orthogonal modules and is now ready for the implementation
of several independent `specialist' modes for convenient typesetting
of Graphs and Trees, 2-cells, String and braid diagrams, etc. (some
are already under construction).

Below I discuss the main features of XY-pic and how it is available.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 2.9 FEATURES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

XY-pic version 2.9 provides two modes of specifying drawings:

* A matrix-like mode where the dimensions of the drawing are
  automatically computed by aligning diagram entries in rows and
  columns (this is also the `version 2 compatibility mode').

* A general `turtle graphic' drawing language for specifying graphs
  with objects and connections between them in a manner independent of
  orientation.

Both modes support the following specific features:

+ Positions can be given in variety of formats (extendable) including
  user defined coordinates (x,y) and relative to previous positions,
  objects, object edges, and points on connections.

+ Objects may be circular or rectangular (more shapes can be added)
  and adjusted in several ways.

+ Large library of objects with mnemonic names.

+ Objects that orient themself along a connection when placed relative
  to it, e.g., `\dir{|-}' is like \vdash but thus oriented; new such
  objects can be defined in a convenient way.

+ Includes circle segments and arbitrary TeX text.

+ Connections are aligned between the reference points of objects but
  start and end on the edges.

+ Any object can be used to build a connection (using `diagonal
  filling'); library objects provide common line types.

+ Special notation for drawing arrows with tail, stem, and head build
  from any object(s).  Special support for arrows that cross each
  other, arrows that `go by' other entries, combined arrows, and
  arrows with n/8 bends.

+ Library of frames.

+ NEW: Special notation for rotation, scaling, colour, and line
  thickness.  The correct typesetting of these features requires a
  backend that supports it (i.e., PostScript) but even when PostScript
  is not available XY-pic tries to approximate what is requested.

+ Output can use PostScript for drawing (several \special formats are
  supported: dvips, dvitops, Textures, and OzTeX -- more are being
  added continuously: contact Ross Moore <ross@mpce.mq.edu.au> for the
  current list).  Notation for inclusion of literal PostScript.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
AVAILABILTY

XY-pic can be retrieved by anonymous ftp from at least the following
locations (given as `site : directory'):

                         Call for Papers

	        The Second ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on 
	       STATE in Programming Languages (SIPL)

                            Jan 22, 1995
                           San Francisco
                  Held in conjunction with POPL '95

Programming languages have been state-based since their inception.
After a period of relative unpopularity, when research focused on
declarative languages, interest in the treatment of state has been
renewed.  Research is increasingly devoted to finding a symbiotic
relationship between the semantic foundations of declarative languages
and the pragmatic handling of state in more conventional languages.
This workshop brings together researchers from various areas,
interested in the common issues of state manipulation in high-level
programming languages.

The first workshop in this series (SIPL '93) was held in Copenhagen in
conjunction with FPCA '93.  The proceedings are available as a Yale
technical report YALEU/DCS/RR-968.  A special issue of the Journal of
Lisp and Symbolic Computation is being published as a follow-up to 
SIPL '93. 

Submissions are invited for the second workshop to be held in
conjunction with POPL '95 in San Francisco.

The workshop addresses the fundamental issues of expressing,
manipulating, and reasoning about state in high-level programming
languages.  The range of topics includes operational and denotational
models of state, assignment and references, semantics of object-
oriented programming, calculi of state and methods to reason about
state.  Novel methods for expressing and controlling state-
manipulation such as linear type systems, effect systems, and monads
are also of interest.  Formal presentations of results, research in
progress, tutorials, and topical discussions are among the possible
venues for interaction.

Dear CATEGORY THEORY COMMUNITY,

[You are on my XY-pic user list because you have once written to me
 about XY-pic.  If you do wish to receive news about XY-pic (or get
 this message twice) then I apologise and ask you to tell me so by
 sending an E-mail to kris@diku.dk.  And now the NEWS:]

This is to announce a BUG FIX release of my DIAGRAM DRAWING PACKAGE,
XY-pic: version 2.10.  It fixes the following user visible bugs in
version 2.9:

* Very high of wide labels were not placed correctly on diagonal
  arrows by the `arrow' feature and in compatibility mode (thanks to
  Clemens Beckstein for finding this).

* Colouring of labels (using the `color' extension) now works!

I'm sorry for releasing so soon after the last release but the bugs
were classed `important'.

Please retrieve the new version by anonymous ftp from

  ftp.diku.dk : 	/diku/users/kris/TeX
  ftp.mpce.mq.edu.au :	/pub/maths/TeX

or the CTAN `macros/generic/diagrams/xypic' mirror which will be up to
date in a day or so.

Subject: McCarty = Eff

Recently in a discussion with J. Lipton there came up the question  
whether the full and faithful embedding of D. McCarty's realisability  
model of IZF into the effective topos  Eff   is actually an  
equivalence. More concretely that means whether any object of the  
effective topos is really isomorphic to an object of the McCarty  
topos. I think the problem is highly nontrivial as the equality  
predicate on an object of the McCarty topos is derived form its  
inductive presentation.
I would be pleased in any comments. Thanks in advance,

The publishers have just informed informed me that the above book has been 
out of print since sept, 1993, that no stock is available, and that the 
copyright reverts to me.

I would consider getting some loose page copies printed and sold if this 
seemed economic, and/or if for example there was a desire to use part or all 
for course adoption. For the latter I could supply a top copy and allow for 
copying to students at a moderate fee per student. Offers welcomed. The aim

                        Synopsis

This thesis is an investigation into axiomatic categorical domain 
theory as needed for the denotational semantics of deterministic 
programming languages. 

To provide a direct semantic treatment of non-terminating computations,
we make partiality the core of our theory. Thus, we focus on categories
of partial maps. We study representability of partial maps and show its
equivalence with classifiability. We observe that, once partiality is 
taken as primitive, a notion of approximation may be derived. In fact, 
two notions of approximation, contextual approximation and 
specialisation, based on testing and observing partial maps are 
considered and shown to coincide. Further we characterise when the 
approximation relation between partial maps is domain-theoretic in the 
(technical) sense that the category of partial maps Cpo-enriches with 
respect to it.

Concerning the semantics of type constructors in categories of partial 
maps, we present a characterisation of colimits of diagrams of total 
maps; study order-enriched partial cartesian closure; and provide 
conditions to guarantee the existence of the limits needed to solve 
recursive type equations. Concerning the semantics of recursive types, 
we motivate the study of enriched algebraic compactness and make it the
central concept when interpreting recursive types. We establish the 
fundamental property of algebraically compact categories, namely that 
recursive types on them admit canonical interpretations, and show that
in algebraically compact categories recursive types reduce to inductive
types. Special attention is paid to Cpo-algebraic compactness, leading 
to the identification of a 2-category of kinds with very strong closure
properties. 

As an application of the theory developed, enriched categorical models 
of the metalanguage FPC (a type theory with sums, products, 
exponentials and recursive types) are defined and two abstract examples
of models, including domain-theoretic models, are axiomatised. Further,
FPC is considered as a programming language with a call-by-value 
operational semantics and a denotational semantics defined on top of a 
categorical model. Operational and denotational semantics are related 
via a computational soundness result. The interpretation of FPC 
expressions in domain-theoretic Poset-models is observed to be 
representation-independent. And, to culminate, a computational adequacy
result for an axiomatisation of absolute non-trivial domain-theoretic 
models is proved.

ABSTRACTS OF COURSES:

Willem Blok and Don Pigozzi:
                         GENERAL ALGEBRAIC LOGIC

"General algebraic logic" can be characterized as the process of reducing
logical deduction, in its broadest sense, to equational logic, the
particularly simple form of logical deduction that underlies most of modern
algebra.  In these lectures we investigate the precise method by which this
reduction can be either completely or partially effected.  We show how this
leads to close connections between logical systems and suitable classes of
algebras, enriched with a predicate when the reduction is only partial.
We outline the theory of algebraization in a very general context,
illustrating the ideas with numerous examples.  Having isolated a precise
notion of algebraizable logic, we show how it provides the proper framework
for studying algebraic equivalents of metalogical properties as, for
example, the property of "possessing a deduction theorem".

Vaughan Pratt:
    CHU SPACES: COMPLEMENTARITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN RATIONAL MECHANICS

"Rational mechanics" captures mind-body duality for autonomous agents in
essentially the same way that quantum mechanics captures momentum-position
duality for physical systems, with Chu spaces in place of Hilbert spaces.
Chu spaces expose a Heisenberg-like uncertainty principle as a previously
unnoticed yet prominent feature of Stone duality.
                         ---------------
Yde Venema:
           BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS WITH OPERATORS & MODAL LOGIC

Formalisms related to Modal Logic play an important role in theoretical
computer science:  think of examples like epistemic logic, dynamic logic
or relational algebra.  Such formalisms can be treated in a nice algebraic
way via the theory of Boolean Algebras with Operators (BAO's).  The course
will be centered around two themes: (1) the duality between BAO's and
Relational (Kripke) Structures, and (2) modal/algebraic languages to
describe these structures. We will review some important and elegant
theorems, like automatic completeness results for a large class of logics.
                         ---------------
Istvan Nemeti and Hajnal Andreka:
     ALGEBRAS OF RELATIONS OF VARIOUS RANKS & THEIR APPLICATIONS

Theories of relations (binary ones, ternary relations, n-ary ones etc.)
play an essential role both in Computer Science and in Logic.  Besides
quantifier logics, they are important for e.g. logics of the dynamic trend,
resource-sensitive logics, substructural logics, logics of actions etc.
We will study algebras whose elements are relations.  Research in this
area has been going on for 140 years, hence its theory is powerful and
profoundly applicable.  The goal of the course is to make this rich theory
accessible, to provide insight into why and how it works, and to highlight
the main directions in which it is "moving".
                         ---------------
Agnes Kurucz and Ildiko Sain:
                   UNIVERSAL ALGEBRA TUTORIAL

Algebras, subalgebras, homomorphisms, congruences, Cartesian products.
Subdirect decomposition, simple and subdirectly irreducible algebras.
Birkhoff's subdirect decomposition theorem.  Ultraproducts, Los theorem.
Birkhoff's variety characterization theorem, quasi-variety characterization
theorem.  Discriminator varieties.
We will give only a brief survey of the above broad material, concentrating
on theorems frequently used in algebraic logic.  Theorems will be stated
and explained but usually not proved.  A detailed lecture notes containing
full proofs will accompany the lectures.
                         ---------------
ABSTRACT OF TALK:

Antonino Salibra (joint work with Don Pigozzi):
              THE ABSTRACT VARIABLE-BINDING CALCULUS

In this talk we illustrate how the algebraizations of classical and
nonclassical logics fit into a general framework of variable-binding and
variable-substitution that includes such diverse variable-binding
operations as lambda abstraction, definite Riemann integration, universal
and existential quantification (in both classical and intuitionistic
logic), and various notions of generalized quantification.  The main
conceptual devices used are the abstract variable-binding calculus
(VB-calculus) and the variety of polyadic VB-algebras.  We show that every
locally finite polyadic VB-algebra is isomorphic to a functional polyadic
VB-algebra that is obtained from some model of the VB-calculus by a natural
coordinatization process.  As an application of this result, we present a
strong completeness theorem for the VB-calculus that specializes to give
a completeness theorem for every VB-theory.  In particular, this result
specializes to a completeness theorem for the familiar formal systems above
specified.
                         ---------------

ABSTRACTS OF WORKSHOP LECTURES:

Viktor Gyuris:
   FINITE SCHEMA AXIOMATIZABLE ALGEBRAIZATION OF FIRST-ORDER LOGIC

The algebraic counterparts of first-order logic obtained so far (e.g.
representable cylindric algebras, representable polyadic algebras,
representable relation algebras) are not axiomatizable even with a finite
schema of equations.  This negative property has lead to serious
difficulties of various kinds.  Here we present an algebraic counterpart
of first-order logic which is axiomatizable by a simple finite schema of
equations.  The key step is to choose the operations suitably on algebras
whose elements are relations of higher ranks.
                         ---------------
Agnes Kurucz:
  DECIDABLE & UNDECIDABLE VARIETIES OF BAO'S AND LOGICS TOUCHED BY THE
                          DYNAMIC TREND

We shall map the landscape of logics of the so called dynamic paradigm from
the point of view of decidability and undecidability.  We will see what
this "map" means for decidability issues about the equational theories of
the algebraic counterparts of these logics.  As a byproduct, we will get
a "systematic" answer to the question "Which varieties of Boolean algebras
with operators are decidable?".  Proof methods will be discussed, too.
                         ---------------
Maarten Marx:
   ARROW LOGICS:  A PARADIGM FOR LOGICS TOUCHED BY THE DYNAMIC TREND

Research in areas such as Computer Science, Linguistics, Artificial
Intelligence and Cognitive Science gave birth to a new paradigm for doing
logic which for brevity we will call the dynamic paradigm.  Logics of this
paradigm include dynamic logic, action logic(s), dynamic semantics,
resource sensitive logics such as linear logic and its fragments and Lambek
Calculus, process logics and algebras, various temporal logics etc.
The theory of Arrow Logics is both  (i) the common backbone of all these
new logics, and  (ii) an explicit formulation of the new paradigm.  One of
the purposes of Arrow Logic is to give insight into the common essence of
all these logics or, in other words, into "what makes them tick".
                         ---------------
Szabolcs Mikulas:
   A TECHNOLOGY FOR OBTAINING WELL-BEHAVED & STRONG ALGEBRA OF RELATIONS

There are many well-investigated and useful logics that do not behave
nicely in certain respects.  Such examples are the undecidability of
classical first-order logic, FOL, incompleteness of its finite variable
fragment, Ln, and the incompleteness and undecidability of the strongest
versions of logics of dynamics and action or resource sensitive logics etc.
Following the ideas of van Benthem and Nemeti, we will discuss how to
"tame" logics so that they behave in a nice way, and at the same time,
remain strong (expressive) or become even stronger.  That is, using the
powerful methods of algebraic logic, we will reformulate several logics
and show that these new versions  (i) have desirable properties such as
completeness, decidability etc., and at the same time  (ii) their
expressive powers remain great or become even greater.
                         ---------------
Szabolcs Mikulas and Andras Simon:
         METHODOLOGY OF APPLYING ALGEBRAIC LOGIC TO LOGIC

This talk aims at improving understandability and usefulness of the
Andreka-Nemeti (AN) lectures as well as the rest of the workshop lectures.
The algebraic investigations in the AN lectures are applied in the workshop
talks, among others, to logics originating from computer science,
linguistics, cognitive science.  The present talk explains the methodology
of these and other applications, putting both the AN lectures and the
workshops in perspective.  We present a methodology of translating purely
logical problems to algebra, then solving them by the strong machinery
available in algebra, and then translating the result back to logic.
The AN lectures as well as the workshops will occasionally refer to the
material covered in the present talk.

ACCOMMODATION:  In double bedrooms for 14 DM/day, or in single bedrooms
for 18 DM/day, in Summer Hotel Hill.  The lectures will be in the same
building.  Address:  Budapest, district XI, Menesi street 5.

MEALS:  Continental breakfast for 4 DM/day, lunch for 5,3 DM/day in Summer
Hotel Hill.  The Drink Bar of Summer Hotel Hill is open from 7 a.m. until
late at night.  Many restaurants are available in the neighborhood of
Summer Hotel Hill.

REGISTRATION:  All participants are requested to register and to pay the
conference fee and charges as appropriate, at the Reception Desk on Sunday,
July 10: 6 p.m. - 10 p.m. or on Monday, July 11: 8 a.m. - 9 a.m. or
12 a.m. - 14 p.m. or 16 p.m. - 18 p.m.  The Reception Desk is located close
to the entrance of Summer Hotel Hill.

REGISTRATION FEE:  120 DM for participants
                    50 DM for accompanying persons.

EXCHANGE OF CURRENCY:  Foreign currency can be brought into Hungary without
restriction and there is no obligation for exchanging currency.  However,
in general, you have to use Hungarian currency (HUF called Forints in
Hungarian) in shops.  Exchange bureaux are available at the airport, in
bigger hotels, in banks and other places.

TRAVEL:  Budapest has two airport terminals, Ferihegy I and Ferihegy II.
>From both terminals you have the same possibilities to come to the center.
   The most convenient way is offered by the Minibus-Service at very
reasonable price.  They take you to any address in Budapest with their
comfortable 8-seaters, for 600 Forints (equivalent to 10 DM) per
person.  Tickets are available at the Airport passenger service counters.
   You can also choose to use buses called "Centrum Airport Service" as well.
These buses leave every 30 minutes to Erzsebet square in central Budapest
for 200 Forints (equivalent to 3,3 DM), from where you can take tram no.49
or no.47 to "Moricz Zsigmond korter", the nearest square to your
accommodation (Summer Hotel Hill, Menesi street 5), which is at 5 minutes
walking distance from the tram station at Moricz Zsigmond korter.
   For using public transportation in Budapest (trams, buses, Metro or
trolley buses), tickets must be purchased in advance, for 25 Forints (0.5 DM)
each trip.  One can buy tickets from slot machines (there are some slot
machines at the airport terminal bus stations), at Metro stations, or from
some of the small shops selling newspaper or tobacco.
