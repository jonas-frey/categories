		Sydney
	17th-19th December, 1994


	PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT

CATS will be open to all aspects of the theory of computer science. It
will provide an opportunity for the scattered community of computing
theorists in Australia and New Zealand to meet and exchange views in
an informal setting. The following people have already expressed an
interest in coming.

Robin Cockett (Calgary)
Eugenio Moggi (Genoa)
Maurice Nivat (France)
Phil Wadler (Glasgow)


The format would be informal, with an easy
balance between lectures and discussions:
registration costs will be kept low.

I have been away and then too busy to examine my mail in detail.  I don't
think I have such a result.  However, it is likely that John Power's
thesis has something on that.  He is in Edinburgh, but is aliased on this
machine[moderator note: `this machine'=`triples.math.mcgill.ca'], so you can
write him here.

Subject: Categorical completeness results for the simply-typed lambda calculus. 

Date: Mon, 04 Jul 94 18:35:50 +0100
From: Alex Simpson <als@dcs.ed.ac.uk>


I would like to know if the results below are folklore. They don't
seem to be, as some recent papers have given lengthy proofs of special
cases. On the other hand, they do follow rather easily from an old result
due to Statman.

The results concern two categorical notions of completeness for
beta-eta conversion relative to the interpretation of the simply-typed
lambda-calculus in cartesian closed categories.


Let C be any CCC (not necessarily with finite limits).

Let I_X be the initial CCC generated by a nonempty set X of objects.

We say that beta-eta conversion has a COMPLETE INTERPRETATION IN C
if there is a faithful CC-functor from I_X to C.

We say that beta-eta conversion is COMPLETE FOR C if the class of all
CC-functors from I_X to C is collectively faithful.

(REMARK. These two definitions do not depend upon X as there is a
faithful CC-functor from C_X to C_1, where 1 is a singleton set.)


EXAMPLES. One category in which beta-eta conversion has a complete
interpretation is the category of sets. (This essentially follows from
Friedman's completeness theorem. The inclusion of product types makes
no significant difference. This latter remark also applies below, e.g.
to the quoted Statman theorem.) It is clear that if beta-eta
conversion has a complete interpretation in any C then it is also
complete for C. The converse does not hold: the category of finite
sets is complete but has no complete interpretation. (That it has no
complete interpretation was observed by Friedman. That it is complete
essentially follows from the Plotkin/Statman finite model theorem.)
Finally, for a trivial example of a C for which beta-eta conversion is
not complete, take C to be any cartesian closed preorder.


The results give necessary and sufficient conditions on C for the
two forms of completeness to hold.

THEOREM 1. Beta-eta conversion has a complete interpretation in C iff
C has an endomorphism all of whose iterates are distinct.

THEOREM 2. Beta-eta conversion is complete for C iff C is not a preorder.


Just some brief comments on the proofs. The stronger result is
Theorem 1. Theorem 2 can be derived from it by showing that if C is
not a preorder then C^omega (the countably infinite power of C) has a
"non-repeating" endomorphism as required by Theorem 1. Theorem 2 can
also be proved by mimicking the full type hierarchy over a finite set
within C, or alternatively by using Statman's characterization of
beta-eta conversion as a maximal congruence relation on closed terms
satisfying "typical ambiguity".

Theorem 1 is proved using a different Statman result. We use sigma to
range over types defined using exponentials and finite products from
one base type, 0. We use L,M,N to range over closed terms in the
simply-typed lambda-calculus with types as above.  We use =be for
beta-eta equality between terms.

Define the type T = (0 -> 0 -> 0) -> (0 ->0).

THEOREM (Statman [1]). For any sigma there is an L of type sigma -> T
such that, for all M, N of type sigma, M =be N iff L(M) =be L(N).

To prove Theorem 1, let a: A --> A be a non-repeating endomorphism
in C. One defines a CC-functor, F, from I_{0} to C by setting:

  F(0) = (A -> A) -> (A -> A).

One can show that F is faithful on the hom-set I_{0}(1,T) (by
encoding binary trees as Church numerals in F(0)). It follows
from Statman's theorem above that F is faithful.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: XY-pic version 2.11 released... 

Date: Tue, 5 Jul 1994 13:45:28 +0200
From: kris@diku.dk

Dear CATEGORY THEORY COMMUNITY,

[Thank you for all the positive replies ... so this time I'll only ask
 those who do NOT wish news about XY-pic or who get it from other
 sources to send me an email saying so :-]

This is to announce yet another BUG FIX release of my DIAGRAM DRAWING
PACKAGE, XY-pic: version 2.11.  It fixes the following user visible
bugs in version 2.10:

* Arrow tips were reversed in a few cases (thanks to Clemens Beckstein
  for finding this (also)).

* Repeated labels on arrows now works.

* The PostScript backend sometimes did curves wrong; this is fixed.

Futhermore it adds a new `Graph Combinator feature' which is specially
designed for enterting diagrams with graph structure.  Please test it
and comment on it.

Please retrieve the new version by anonymous ftp from

  ftp.diku.dk : 	/diku/users/kris/TeX
  ftp.mpce.mq.edu.au :	/pub/maths/TeX

or the CTAN `macros/generic/diagrams/xypic' mirror which will be up to
date in a day or so.


Regards,

Date: Wed, 6 Jul 94 14:25:55 EDT
From: Djordje Cubric <cubric@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

I would like to make ``a point of an empty set'' and say that Friedman's
completeness theorem for typed lambda calculus (with appropriate changes)
implies the completeness result for free cartesian closed categories (as
mentioned in a recent posting of Alex Simpson) provided that one proves
first that in a free ccc all objects have a global support. One way to do
that is to prove the confluence for the appropriate system of reductions.
Some of the recent papers were dealing with these reductions.
One can see that the completeness holds even when the free ccc has also free
arrows among freely generated types.

Friedman's completeness theorem is completeness of beta,eta for
full classical model (i.e., Set). Deductive completeness fails
for Set and for models (interpretations into categories) where
every type (every object named by a type expression) is required
to be non-empty (have a global element). I tried to clarify this
in my book (still to appear). If anyone is seriously interested,
I could email the appropriate sections of the book.

                        University of Cambridge, UK.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


The sixth of the biennial conferences on Category Theory and Computer Science 
is to be held in Cambridge in 1995, in conjunction with the third Cambridge 
Summer Meeting in Category Theory.

The purpose of the conference series is the advancement of the foundations
of computing using the tools of category theory, algebra, geometry and logic.  
Whilst the emphasis is upon applications of category theory, it is recognised 
that the area is highly interdisciplinary and the organising committee welcomes 
submissions in related areas. Topics central to the conference include:

	    Models of computation	       Program logics and specification
	    Type theory and its semantics      Domain theory
	    Linear logic and its applications  Categorical programming

Submissions purely on category theory are also acceptable as long as the
applicability to computing is evident.

Previous meetings have been held in Guildford (Surrey), Edinburgh,
Manchester, Paris and Amsterdam.

It is anticipated that the proceedings will be published by Springer in the
LNCS series.

From: Murray Adelman <murray@zeus.mpce.mq.edu.au>


I have mounted four papers by John Corbett and myself that attempt to
use sheaf theory to interpret Quantum Logic (or our version thereof)
on the Sydney University ftp site.

They are called

Adelman-Corbett.ps ---Long with a lot of expository material for
physicists.

comparison.ps---Attempts to compare Birkhoff and vonNeumann Quantum
logic to the internal logic of the category of sheaves over state
space

newpaper.ps--- Attempts to show how continuous data can become
discrete data via the global sections functor

heidelberg.ps---Derives a formula for interference of particles that
allows more of the configuration of the experiment to be parametrized
than the usual Hilbert Space description.

The union of heidelberg.ps and comparison.ps approximates (and perhaps
supersedes) Adelman-Corbett.ps which is somewhat older.

They can be obtained by anonymous ftp from

Subject: E-M factorization system question 

Date: Mon, 18 Jul 1994 20:35:02 -0700
From: "William H. Rowan" <rowan@crl.com>

I am working on a construction which, given a category with an E-M
factorization system (such as onto-oneone functions in the category of sets
or universal algebras of a given type) provides an embedding

	F:A --> B

where A is the given category, and F embeds A fully into B.  B also has an
E-M factorization system.  However, if a is an object of A, then the e's of
Fa are exactly all filters in the lattice of e's of a in A, and the m's of
Fa are exactly all filters in the lattice of m's of a in A.

The question, of course, is, has this been done by anyone before and if so,
please provide a reference to that work.

Subject: characterization of geometric morphisms of the form Pi_I ?? 

Date: Wed, 20 Jul 94 20:32:52 +0200
From: Thomas Streicher <streiche@informatik.uni-muenchen.de>

I would like to know whether somebody knows of an abstract  
characterization of those geometric morphisms (between elementary  
toposes) which are of the form  Pi_I : E/I -> E  for some I in E ?
My - maybe misleading - intuition is that a topos is a generalized  
locale and the functor  I* : E -> E/I  corresponds to the locale  
morphisms corresponding to open subspace inclusions. 

(If  L  is a locale and  x  is in L  then the mapping   y |-> x inf y   
from  L  to   { z : L |  z  less or equal  x }   is the locale  
morphism corresponding to the open subspace inclusion of the open  
subset given by  x  into the space given by  L).
Maybe it is also wrong to think of a topos simply as generalized  
locale and that the "generalized locale" is given by the fibration   
Sub(E) -> E  and not by the fibration  cod : Map(E) -> E . What I  
know about open geometric morphisms seems to confirm this latter  
viewpoint.
So I am a bit confused and would appreciate any hints !
