Subj:	Lemma on fibrations
From: mxh@dcs.ed.ac.uk
Date: Tue, 1 Dec 92 15:12:49 GMT

I'm looking for a reference for the following lemma on composition of
fibrations 

Let p:E->B and r:B->A be fibrations and D be a subcategory of A->
stable under pullback. If r has indexed products along morphisms in D
and if p has indexed products along all cartesian maps above something
in D then the composition rp has indexed products along D, too and the
Beck-Chevalley condition holds.

Let T : A^op --> Cat be a (pseudo) functor (such as obtained from a fibred
category p : E --> A by taking T(a) to be the fibre of E over a in A).
Suppose that A has pullbacks and that each T(f) : T(a) --> T(b) has an
adjoint. Take a pullback square in A; apply T;  now replace a pair of
opposite sides in the square of functors by their adjoints. There is a
canonical natural transformation in that square.

We say T satisfies the Chevalley-Beck condition when this nat tran is
invertible for all pullback squares.

[See 
Benabou and Roubaud, Monades et descente, CR Acad Sc Paris 270 (1970)
96-98, 
                                and 
Lawvere, Equality in hyperdoctrines & comprehension schema as an adjoint
functor, Proc. Symposia in Pure Math 17 (AMS 1970) 1-14.]

The Chev-Beck cond is part of the requirement that T (as a category varying
over A) should "have small coproducts" in the sense that every pointwise
left kan extension into T, along a functor between small discrete variable
categories, should exist. It is also required that each category T(a)
should have small coproducts and each functor T(f) should preserve them.

> what in the world is the Beck-Chevalley condition?

Bill Lawvere ("Adjointness in Foundations", Dialectica, 23 (1969) 281-296)
observed that

        the quantifiers are the adjoints to substitution

However mere category theory is not sufficient to capture exactly the syntactic
properties of quantification. The Beck-Chevalley condition says that

        you can substitute inside quantifiers.

where the categorical formulation is as Ross Street gave it.
Jean B\'enabou, Robert Seely and others have studied aspects of it in detail.

There is a result which can be used in showing that every algebraic functor
has an adjoint (Lawvere's thesis): 
if V is a cartesian closed category then the pointwise left kan extension k
: A --> V of a finite product preserving functor f : B --> V, along any
functor r : B --> A, is finite product preserving.

[This can be tricky to prove, even for the expert. The only time I remember
Saunders hesitating a bit during his marathon lecturing stint at Bowdoin
College, Maine Summer 1969 was exactly over this point near the end of a
lecture. He was trying to do it from the universal property of kan
extensions. That evening Dubuc and I pointed out that pointwiseness was
essential; by the next lecture Saunders had a proof which I'm sure he would
have found without our comments!] Brian Day's Masters Thesis had a proof in
the appendix. Borceux-Day have something that I have no time to look up in
Bull Austral Math Soc (I think; help anyone?). Max Kelly and Stephen Lack
have done something recently to appear in Appl Cat Structures Vol 1 (Univ
Syd Math Report 92-29).

But what the crumbs is Ross on about in relation to Martin Hofmann's
question, you ask. Well, take V to be Cat, which is cartesian closed. Let p
: E --> B be obtained from f : B --> Cat by the Grothendieck construction.
Then r o p is the fibration constructed from k : A --> Cat.

So, a reference? I'd say "its a variant of the above result on kan extns of
prod pres funcs".

It is also true that Cat is a topos wrt categories enriched over it, and
then left kan extn of a (enriched) left exact functor into Cat is left
exact. [See Kelly's paper in Cahiers on enriched locally presentable
categories.]

No time to give all the detail I'd like.

From: Vaughan Pratt <pratt@coraki.stanford.edu>

This is to announce the availability by anonymous FTP of "Linear Logic
for Generalized Quantum Mechanics," to appear in the forthcoming
proceedings of the recent Physics of Computation Workshop.

ABSTRACT

Quantum logic is static, describing automata having uncertain states
but no state transitions and no Heisenberg uncertainty tradeoff.  We
cast Girard's linear logic in the role of a dynamic quantum logic,
regarded as an extension of quantum logic with time nonstandardly
interpreted over a domain of linear automata and their dual linear
schedules.  In this extension the uncertainty tradeoff emerges via the
``structure veil.'' When VLSI shrinks to where quantum effects are
felt, their computer-aided design systems may benefit from such logics
of computational behavior having a strong connection to quantum
mechanics.

I suppose you want to show
	1) if r and p have enough indexed products, then rp has them;
	2) if r and p satisfy the Beck-Chevalley (what-in-the-world) 
	condition, then rp does
- and then all this relativized with respect to a family of arrows D.
  

ad 1) To construct the indexed products for rp, one needs NOT only
enough indexed products in r and in p, but p must ALSO satisfy a weak
form of the Beck-Chevalley-what-in-the-world condition. (I suppose
the term "indexed products", as used in the query, does not include
this condition - since it is singled out at the end.) The construction
is in my thesis:
	Predicates and Fibrations, Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht 1990,
	prop. II.3.73
I think I had an example of two poset morphisms, which were
fibrations, showing that the indexed products alone do not suffice.

ad 2) A direct derivation of the Beck-Chevalley for the products in rp
from this condition for the products in r and in p - seemed to me
rather involved, because one had to chase those vertical-cartesian
spans - the arrows of the opposite fibration (which is where the
indexed products come about). It was simpler to forget the indexed
products, and use my characterisation of the Beck-Chevalley-world
condition for fibrations in general:
	Categorical interpolation: descent and the
	Beck-Chevalley-world condition without direct images, Springer 
	Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1488  
(The characterisation in this paper is not as simple as it could be,
but I think it can be used.)

	Regards,
	Dusko Pavlovic

P.S. Sorry.

The Chevalley-Beck condition actually deals with bi-fibrations.
Let p : E ---> B be a bi-fibration, and consider a pullback square in the base
category B, say

               f
	A ----------> B
        | _|          |
        |             |
      h |             | g
        |             |
        V             V
        C ----------> D
               k

Probably the most intuitive case is the one of the codomain functor from the
full subcategory of the arrow category Set^2 (where 2 denotes the two-element
chain with 0 < 1) that has all monos as objects to Set. The fibres essentially
are the power sets. It is a trivial exercise to show that it doesn't matter
whether we first take the inverse image under h and then the direct image
under f, or first the direct image under k and then the inverse image under g.

The Chevalley-Beck condition generalizes this pleasant situation to arbitrary
bi-fibrations. Consider a commutative square in E, say

               t
        X ----------> Y
        |             |
        |             |
      u |             | v
        |             |
        V             V
        Z ----------> W
               w

"over" the pullback above, such that u and v are cartesian (this corresponds
to taking inverse images in the simple setting) and w is co-cartesian (this
corresponds to to taking direct images). The Chevalley-Beck condition now
states that t has to be co-cartesian as well.

Other people on the net are better qualified to point out the significance of
this condition. But I'd like to mention that even in the study of categorical
closure operators this type of condition is the *right* one and arises
naturally. This discovery was quite a pleasant surprize for me, after wrestling
with unwieldy other conditions for a while.

I hope this helps!

A look at Lawvere's paper on "Metric spaces, Generalized Logic, and Closed
Categories" might 
help as well.

It is Claude: he used this condition in his seminar on descent in
1964. The fact that it is also a big thing in logic nowadays - it
provides computer scientists with quantifiers - perhaps suggests that
Lawvere (and some German philosophers) might be right about the unity
of the worls.

I am afraid it's worse than that. In Greece, the irony used to be the
essence of the tragedy: the distance which allows public to watch the
bloody clashes of the antagonists, resulting in death and the unity.
In Bosnia, "the tragedy repeats itself" as the reality (not "as a
farce", as the quotation would go) --- stripped of the irony. Instead
of heroic katarsis, there is this fascist "clensing" of the helpless.
And there is no deus ex machina.

I am sorry, I am obvously saying what doesn't belong here, talking
to suppress thoughts perhaps, but there is no irony.

             Linear Logic is nonregressively productive and
         not self-realizable, Nonmonotonic Logic is regressively
               nonproductive and self satisfied.

ABSTRACT: The amazing results quoted in the title are proved.
They have unprecedented and unpredictable consequences such as:

1. Linear logic being  nonregressively productive, no matter how
good a theorem you produce, a harder and better one is waiting out there.

2. Linear logic is never satisfied with itself, which means that
it is an infinite source of new results.

In contrast,

3. Nonmonotonic logic being regressively nonproductive, no matter how
bad a result you produce, there is a worse one waiting out there.

4. This does not matter anyway, since nonmonotonic logic is
self satisfied.

There are other incredible consequences of these results. For example,
the discontinuum hypothesis is independent of NMZF
(nonmonotonic ZF), and Riemann's Hypothesis gives in.

The proof techniques are the most revolutionary aspect of this work.
The main new concept is that of an FBI sheaf. To define an FBI sheaf,
it was necessary to define a variant of Grothendieck topologies,
named undercover agents. Then, an undertopos is like a topos, except
that it has a subobject declassifier. An FBI site is a category with 
undercover agents. FBI sheaves cannot be glued, but they
can be shredded. By iterating sheaf shredding long enough, we
get an FBI sheaf sufficiently small that, it splits (et oui!).
This is why the French say: "Voila le topo(s)".
The most amazing of all is that in fact, using Freyd undercovers
and the fact that A => A is intuitionistically provable, we
get that every FBI sheaf over a big site is nonregressive.
This is because all undercover agents eventually split.
It it then an easy matter to get our fundamental results.
They explain a lot, in particular about funding.


Note from the moderator:

I received (hard)-mail from Kurt W.A.J.H.Y Riellag late last night.
Kurt W.A.J.H.Y Riellag is an illegitimate descendant of the well
known Bourbaki. He has been working on these results for many years
while bottling wine in the caves at Beaune. 
Amazingly enough, Kurt W.A.J.H.Y  Riellag has no diplommas whatsoever,
but he knows his wines (and cheese).

Unfortunately, I learned this morning that Kurt W.A.J.H.Y Riellag
went for his annual retreat at some unknown mountain winery.
This means that someone here at Penn will have to give the
talk if we want to hear it. I did receive a large stack of
wine bottle labels containing the entire paper scribbled on them.

--Jean              And by the way,


              MERRY CHRISTMAS, and  HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!

The next talk after Kurt W.A.J.H.Y Riellag will be on January 18.
Speaker: Ross Street.

Sorry, but I had missed the last page (wine bottle label) of
his letter. 

1. His results also show that
Unconstrained logic deprogramming a is regressively nonproductive and 
self satisfied. 

2. He intended to submit this aper to LICS, but missed the deadline.

3. I was informed by Diaconescu that most of his results are in fact
folklore. Every Roumanian child knows about the undertopos.

From: <cxm7@pop.cwru.edu>

-------------

	I would very much like to read the first two parts of Grothendieck's
_Recoltes et Semailles_, that is:

	Fatuite et Renouvellement

and

	L'Enterrement I, ou la robe de L'Empereur de Chine

	These were already unavailable from the dept at Montpellier
some years ago, when they did send me _l'Enterrement_ II and III
and three smaller volumes.

	There was talk about them being published as a book, but I do
not believe they have been.

	I would be grateful if any one could arrange to lend me a copy
(or sell me one).

                               15 January 1993

The purpose of the symposia is to encourage high-quality research in all
branches of Theoretical Computer Science and to provide an opportunity of
bringing together specialists working actively in the area.

The MFCS'93 symposium will be organized by the Institute of Computer Science
of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Gdansk, Poland.

Principal areas of interest of the symposium include:

  * software specification and development, 
  * parallel and distributed computing, 
  * semantics and logics of programs, 
  * algorithms, complexity and computability,
  * database theory,
  * logic programming,
  * functional programming,
  * other related topics.

The scientific programme will include invited lectures by

  - Krzysztof R. Apt (Amsterdam),
