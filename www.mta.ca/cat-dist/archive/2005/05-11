Just been away so it was interesting to see the correspondence on all this,
in the double case.

It is useful first to have some examples of weak double categories. As
usual, these can come from homotopy theory.

Let A,B be subspaces of a space X. R= Let R_2(X:A,B) be the space of maps
I^2 \to X which map the edges in direction 1 to A and the edges in direction
2 to B (so A,B had better have a non empty intersection). Then we get
partially defined compositions in both directions, but no identities, no
associativity. You can do better by considering `Moore rectangles'. There
are also involutions in each directions, giving -_1, -_2.

It seems hard to get a homotopy double groupoid out of this, unless one of
A,B is contained in the other. However Loday showed that the fundamental
group of R at the constant map does inherit the other 2 structures, giving a
cat^2-group (a double groupoid in groups).

It is a nice exercise to generalise the above to an n-ad (n-subspaces).

Curiously, the interchange law is exactly valid in R_2.

I expect that this law is one of those to go, for certain applications, such
as multiple holonomy, and rewriting. The first could be important for
gravity theory (that would be nice!).

There is a way of handling the first (?) obstruction to the interchange law,
by considering cubical multiple categories with connection as defined in

116. (with F.A. AL-AGL and R. STEINER), `Multiple categories: the
equivalence between a globular and cubical approach', Advances in
Mathematics, 170 (2002) 71-118.

The monoidal closed structure allows for the notion of `cubical algebra'.
i.e. with a monoid structure w.r.t. tensor product. C \otimes C \to C. This
includes a whiskering operation of C_0 on the left and right of C_1, and
also a map say b: C_1 \times C_1 \to C_2, which somehow measures the failure
of the interchange law for the each of the two binary operations which can
be defined on C_1 using whiskering. Such a cubical algebra should (?) be
related to Sjoerd Crans' tesis, but the cubical format could be more
convenient: I have always found that format more useful in several ways than
the globular approach, as multiple compositions are easy to understand, but
the relation between the two, when it exists, is important.

Analogues of the map b occur in braided crossed modules, 2-crossed modules,
automorphisms of crossed modules, ....

In the paper

123. (with I.ICEN), `Towards a 2-dimensional notion of holonomy',
Advances in Math, 178 (2003) 141-175.

we tried to get towards a double groupoid associated with 2-holonomy, but
this now seems naive. We would like a map such as the above b to be involved
with some physical phenomena!
Properties of the globular version may not yet have been written down! But
groupoid/crossed module analogues are in

59.  (with N.D. GILBERT), ``Algebraic models of 3-types and
automorphism  structures for crossed modules'', {\em Proc. London
Math. Soc.} (3) 59 (1989)  51-73.

Given an additive category  *C*, its finite co-completion, R(*C*), may
be constructed as the full subcategory of finitely presented objects
(see footnote for a definition of f.p.) in the category of abelian-
group-valued presheaves on  *C*. The finite completion, L(*C*)  may
therefore be constructed as  (R(*C*`))` (using ` to denote here the
dual category).

Remarkably:
                       R(L(*C*))  =  L(R(*C*))
Moreover:
          It is the free abelian category generated by  *C*.

To be precise, it is an abelian category and every additive functor
from  *C*  to an abelian category extends to an exact functor on
R(L(*C*)), uniquely up to natural equivalence.

(If the target of the additive functor is not abelian then there are
extensions, but not necessarily any that preserve both finite limits
and co-limits.)

If one starts with a one-object additive category -- that is, a ring
-- then its finite co-completion, the category of f.p. presheaves,
is, of course, just the category of f.p. modules (as usually
understood). So the free abelian category generated by a ring, R, may
be constructed as the full category of f.p. covariant abelian-group-
valued functors on the category of f.p. R-modules.

If  R  is commutative (or if it has an anti-involution) then the
freeness means this category of f.p. functors is self-dual.
Moreover:
                    It is a *-autonomous.category.

There are a lot of functors in this category. Besides being closed
under the abelian operations it is closed under composition. (Any
group-valued functor lifts canonically to an R-module-valued functor,
hence composition is defined.) The dual of  Hom(A,--)  is  A * --
(using  *  for tensor product) and the dual of Ext^n (A,--) is
Tor_n (A,--). The dual of a composition  ST  is the composition
of their duals (do not reverse the order of composition).

I found all this when trying recently to simplify the proofs for the
symmetric construction of free abelian categories (Murray Abelian,
Categories Over Additive Ones. J. Pure Appl. Algebra 3 (1973),
103--117). The point of departure was the recognition that free
abelian categories always have enough projectives (and, dually, enough
injectives). Since at least the world's first category theory
conference it has been known that an abelian category with enough
projectives is the finite co-completion of its full subcat of
projectives. (Representations in abelian categories. Proc. Conf.
Categorical Algebra (La Jolla, Calif., 1965) pp. 95--120 Springer, New
York)

Herein is the outline of this alternate approach. I find it hard to
believe that it is new.

We will assume that  *C*  is already additive in the stronger sense,
that is, it has finite direct sums.

For a first-order construction of  R(*C*)  start with the category
of maps in  *C*  (that is, the category of functors from the ordinal
2  to  *C* ) and then reduce by a notion of "homotopy": a map from
A' --> A  to  B' --> B,
                                  a
                               A'--> A

                             f'|     | f

                               B'--> B
                                  b

(all vertical arrows point down) is null-homotopic if a map  A --> B'
can be inserted making the _lower_ of the two triangles commute.

The functor  *C* --> R(*C*)  sends  A  to  O --> A.

A cokernel of the displayed  f-map is constructible as:

                               B' ---> B

                               |       |

                             A + B'--> B

where each map is given by a matrix in which each entry is either 1
or a single letter (b,f), if such fits, else 0.

Given a functor, T, to a finitely co-complete category, define
T(A'--> A)  by choosing a cokernel of  T(A') --> T(A). It is
easy to verify that  T  preserves cokernels.

LEMMA: If  *C*  is finitely complete, then  R(C)  is abelian and
       *C* --> R(*C*) preserves finite limits.

BECAUSE: An additive category is abelian if each map can be factored
as a cokernel (of something) followed by a kernel. The  f-map
displayed map above factors as:
                                  a
                               A'--> A

                               |     | 1

                               P --> A

                               |     | f

                               B'--> B
                                  b

with the lower square is a pullback diagram. It is a good finger-
exercise to see that the upper square is a cokernel of the pullback
square:
                               P'--> P

                               |     |

                               A'--> A

(which being monic is therefore the kernel of the given  f-map) and
the lower square is a kernel of the already mentioned cokernel:

                               B' ---> B

                               |       |

                             A + B'--> B

Finally then, given a functor, T, from a finitely complete  *C*  to an
abelian category it is easy to verify that if  T  preserves finite
limits then the right-exact extension of  T  to  R(*C*)  is not just
right exact but exact.

When  *C*  is finitely complete one may verify that every projective
in  R(*C*)  is isomorphic to an object in the image of  *C* --> R(*C*)
Because that functor preserves kernels we see easily that  R(*C*)  has
global dimension at most two. One may prove that if a free abelian
category has global dimension at most one then it has global dimension
zero. Hence the only global dimensions that can occur are 0 and 2.
(Every abelian category of global dimension zero is a free abelian
category -- of itself. All additive functors therefrom preserve finite
limits and co-limits.)

The dual of the free abelian category generated by  *C*  is
necessarily isomorphic to the free abelian category generated by the
dual of  *C*. Hence (still using ` to denote duals) we have
(R(L(*C*`)))` = R(L(*C*)). But (R(L(*C*`))` = L(L(*C*`)`) = L(R(*C*)).

The *-autonomous structures must wait.

Footnote:

By a FINITELY PRESENTED object in a co-complete category is meant an
object whose corresponding covariant representable functor preserves
filtered co-limits. If  *C*  has finite direct sums then a presheaf
(all presheaves will be understood to be valued in the category of
abelian groups) is f.p. iff it appears as the cokernel of a map
between representables.

Postscript:

Where is the abelianess of the target category being used? If it is
abelian then -- using the notation above -- one can prove that

                T(P') --> T(P) --> Cok(Ta) --> Cok(Tb)

is exact. The extension of  T  is defined so that it preserves the
cokernel of  T(P') --> T(P). One invokes abelianess of the target
to know that it therefore preserves the kernel of  Cok(Ta) --> Cok(Tb).

Hi, category theorists,
 1. In a message to the categories list from 15. jan.1997 (that message can
be seen at http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/catlist/1999/finite-topos) Lawvere
talks about "the ... internal topos ... which parametrizes the decidable
K-finites". Does anyone know what exactly is that internal topos? Is there
some morphism that can be seen as the indexed family of decidable K-finites
(just like the generic cardinal "is" the indexed family of finite cardinals
and can be used to construct the full internal subcategory of finite
cardinals)?
 2. An object Y of a topos is said to have locally a property P if there is
an object Z with global support such that Z*(Y) has the property P. For the
topos of sheaves on a T1-space X (and a property P stable under pullback
along subterminals), I convinced myself that this implies the existence of =
a
covering of X, such that P holds on the restriction of Y to each open set o=
f
the covering. Can this also be proved for schemes or other classes of
topological spaces, maybe with additional conditions on P?
 Thanks a lot!
 Peter

I can't remember exactly what Bill was talking about in that posting.
However, there is no hope of `parametrizing' decidable K-finite objects
by an internal category, unless the ambient topos has a natural number
object (cf. the remarks on pp. 1058-9 of "Sketches of an Elephant"), and
if it does the decidable K-finites are exactly the objects locally
isomorphic to finite cardinals. So I suspect that he was referring to
the internal category of finite cardinals.

Yes, of course -- this is exactly the geometric intuition behind this
use of "locally". One needs to assume that P is stable under arbitrary
pullback (which will certainly be the case if it's expressible in the
internal language of a topos). Then, in any topos generated by
subterminals (in particular, in any topos of sheaves on a space),
every cover Z -->> 1 is dominated by one of the form
\coprod_i U_i -->> 1, where the U_i are a family of subterminals
covering 1 in the classical sense. So P holds locally for Y iff it
holds for the restriction of Y to each member of some cover in
the classical sense.

What I was talking about 15 Jan 1997 was
(not hoping for an axiom of infinity without assuming one, but)

the fact that most of the mathematical uses of the rig N of natural
numbers do not work in a topos, if one interprets that rig to mean the one
characterized by Dedekind recursion.

1. starting with characteristic functions of subobjects, then adding and
multiplying them for various combinatorial calculations
2. applying the least number principle
3. measuring the fiber dimension of a bundle of linear spaces

all require the inf-completion of N, also known as the semicontinuous
natural numbers. It contains the truth-value object omega and is contained
in the semicontinuous reals (themselves indispensible for norming internal
Banach spaces, and constructible simply as one-sided Dedekind cuts).

Yet another way to picture these objects in the case of a Grothendieck
topos E is to consider the sheaf of germs of continuous maps from E to the
appropriate locale : the order topology (not the discrete one) on N, the
order topology (not the interval topology) on nonnegative reals.

Is any more known now as opposed to 9 years ago about the mathematical
applications of finiteness to variable and cohesive sets ? The fact that
K-finiteness is appropriate for some applications and that its theory
resembles the classical theory for constant discrete sets should not
distract us from the achievements of geometers in using coherence,
Notherianness,etc., nor from the fact that our "logic" should serve to
partly guide the learning of also those developments of thought.

				   CALL FOR PAPERS

				    Special Issue on
				  APPLIED SEMANTICS
				       of the
		       Journal of Theoretical Computer Science

	       http://lionel.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/APPSEM05/journal_call.php


We  invite the  submission  of full  papers on  the  topic of  Applied Sema=
ntics,  as
described below,  for publication in  a special issue  of the Journal  of T=
heoretical
Computer Science (TCS).  Papers should  be revised versions of those papers=
 submitted
to and presented at the  APPSEM05 Workshop, Frauenchiemsee, Germany, Septem=
ber 12-15.
However, we  will consider submissions of  papers not presented  there, pro=
vided they
fall into  the scope of  the call and  clearly work out  a novel contributi=
on  to the
field that wasn't mature enough to be presented at the aforementioned works=
hop.

Programming languages  are the basic tools  with which all  applications of=
 computers
are built.   It is important, therefore, that  they should be well  designe=
d and well
implemented. Achieving these goals requires  both a good theoretical unders=
tanding of
programming language designs, and practical skills in the development of hi=
gh quality
compilers. This special issue will cover all these areas and will focus on =
the formal
basis for programming languages.

The general areas covered by this special issue are as follows:

   1. Program structuring: object-oriented programming, modules,
   2. Proof assistants, functional programming, and dependent types,
   3. Program analysis, generation, and configuration,
   4. Specification and verification methods,
   5. Types and type inference in programming,
   6. Games, sequentiality, and abstract machines,
   7. Semantic methods for distributed computing,
   8. Resource models and web data,
   9. Continuous phenomena in Computer Science.
  10. Industrial applications.

This list is non-exclusive, but contributions that do not clearly fall into=
 one of
these topics should carefully work out their relationship.

We particularly invite industrial contributions covering the areas above.  =
This could
mean development  of a novel language,  a novel compiler, program  analysis=
 tools, or
indeed, just a semantic model for a new kind of application.  Again, this l=
ist is not
exclusive and we welcome  papers on any kind of industrial work  which is i=
nformed by
the science  of programming  languages, clearly states  the problem being  =
solved and
elaborates on the main techniques of the above research areas being used to=
 solve it.

Greetings.

I'm hoping to make Osvaldo Acuna-Ortega aware, either directly or through the intervention of some kind reader, that in 5-6 days or so I'll be in Costa Rica for about a week, including San Jose.

There's a six-month lectureship in Glasgow being advertised.  It's for
Jan-June next year, and the closing date is soon (18 Nov).  See

http://www.jobs.ac.uk/jobfiles/PX792.html

We'll be continuing to hire new permanent staff over the next few years,
so if you're interested, this may be a good way of selling yourself.

I would be grateful for advice and background on the following question or
issues, on which I do not know the computer science background.

I have read that rewriting for monoid presentations is relevant to program
specification.

Now at Bangor we have been involved with computing induced actions of
monoids (and categories)
(with Anne Heyworth), `Using rewriting systems to compute
left Kan extensions and induced actions of categories', J.
Symbolic Computation 29 (2000) 5-31.
where there is defined the notion of presentation for the data of a Kan
extension (= induced action).
--------------------------------------
Question: is it reasonable to say that rewriting for such a presentation is
relevant to program specification in which information is also given on the
input to the program?
-----------------------------------------
The intuitive idea is that a program may be very complex, even undecidable,
or inconsistent, but if the input is trivial, or simple, then the output may
be decidable, and simple. Perhaps there are commercial examples of this,
where most users give simple inputs?

Recall that  we get induced actions for monoids when given a morphism u:
M --> N of monoids, an action of M on X, and so get an action of N on a set
u_*(X). A presentation for this involves a presentation for N, and
generators A for M, and the values of these generators in terms of the
presentation of N. If these generators act trivially on X, and u(A)
generates N, then the induced action is on X again, with trivial action of
N.

A recent application of these ideas of induced actions of categories is for
computing double cosets (math.CO/0508391 with Neil Ghani, Anne Heyworth,
Chris Wensley, JSC to appear).

There is one part of your questions that I can comment on:

Consider a Computer Algebra System (ie like Maple or Mathematica).
Almost everything interesting it does in the area of Analysis is
formally undecidable.  This is because zero-equivalence for any
interesting subset of the (constructive) reals is undecidable, and
almost all CAS algorithms to do analysis (integration, solving
equations, limits, simplification, etc) requires many zero-equivalence
tests, amongst many undecidable problems.

Nevertheless, these systems are very powerful, and frequently return
interesting answers to even fairly complex user input.  This is because
most users give ``structured'' input, for which semi-decision procedures
seem to be quite adequate.  Of course, if you happen to know exactly
which semi-decision procedures are being used, you can fool them and get
the system to either go into an infinite loop or give a wrong answer.
But that requires a huge amount of knowledge to do so.  The average user
would be unable to manufacture such examples.

It is very important to note that the distinction is between
``structured'' input and ``generic'' input, rather than between simple
and complex.  In other words, what seems to matter most is the
Kolmogorov Complexity (or in the specification case, the logical
succinctness) of an input.  [See
http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~carette/publications/simplification.pdf for
one approach to this].

There are similar examples in the automated theorem proving world, where
in particular PVS and IMPS can frequently prove theorems which are not a
priori known to be in a decidable subclass.  Here again, a combination
of semi-decision procedures driven by intelligent heuristics seems to be
highly effective.

I have a rather unfortunate experience with "average users" who get
wrong answers from CAS's, namely our undergraduate math majors. In their
first-year analysis course they learn how to compute limits. Invariably,
they are given some limits which Mathematica gets wrong, e.g.:

Limit[((1 + 4 x^2)^(1/4) - (1 + 5 x^2)^(1/5))/(a^(-x^2/2) - Cos[x]),
      x -> 0]

The answer is 0, _except_ when the parameter a equals e, in which case
the answer is 6. Yes, this is a nasty limit pulled out of a hat, but it
is precisely the sort of thing we test our students on. It is rather
disappointing that Mathematica falls into exactly the same sort of trap
as the average student.

Another example is the use of l'Hospital rule, which is used by every
CAS. There is a side condition which is not checked by them, which makes
them give wrong answers. (The side condition is very nasty to check,
namely, whether the zero of a derivative is isolated.)

The situation is even worse when engineers and physicsts use CAS. They
trust them blindly (I suspect). One day they're going to build a nuclear
power plant based on a faulty limit computed by Mathematica or Maple.

I should have been more precise when I spoke of "decision procedures" in
the context of a CAS.  There are many semi-decision procedures for
non-parametric problems.  For parametric problems, these procedures
break down.  The issue is almost always the same: a theorem is applied
without properly checking side-conditions.  Frequently, the issue is one
of zero recognition in the presence of parameters, but there can be more
complex situations, such as the one Andrej points out.

CASes are typically very good at getting good answers at non-parametric
problems, and my comments were aimed mostly at that class.  Computer
Algebra implementers (and I used to be one) are typically very afraid of
combinatorial explosions, as a lot of computer algebra people are
``algorithms'' people.  Their mathematics background was often such that
they prefered a ``generic'' answer quickly than a thorough answer that
was a) a mess, and b) slow to get.  This is, in part, why I am now in
academia, as I want to ``fix'' that.

This is exactly the kind of parameter specialization problem where CAS
designers have ``chosen'' to ignore and return a generic answer.  This
has been documented since at least 1991 in a nice paper in the Bulletin
of the AMS.

I don't know about Mathematica, but Maple does NOT use l'Hospital's
rule.  Almost all limits are computed using one-sided asymptotic series
expansions, as l'Hospital's rule is just not very suitable to
large-scale computations.  If interested, I can provide various
published references to the algorithms involved.

Of course, one still needs to check that the leading term is non-zero.
For the limit above, observe (in Maple):
 > assume(a::real, x::real);
 > f := ((1 + 4*x^2)^(1/4) - (1 + 5*x^2)^(1/5))/(a^(-x^2/2) - cos(x)):
 > normal(series(f, x=0,5));

                             1        2       4
                       - ---------- x~  + O(x~ )
                         ln(a~) - 1


which clearly indicates that a=exp(1) is a problem point.  That the
limit is computed anyways is an instance of choosing the ``generic''
answer [whatever that means].

Engineers and physicists don't use CAS - they use Matlab.  The errors
you get there are both worse and better: worse because numerical
algorithms are so much more prone to giving (silent) nonsense, and
better because Matlab cannot phrase any problems which are parametric!

In Ontario (where I teach to Engineers), an Engineer who used either a
CAS or Matlab in a computation for their safety critical system and did
not check the correctness of the result, would be fully liable for any
ensuing problems on their design.  Thus, theoretically, Professional
Engineers are supposed to given full justifications for the answers of
the tools they use.  In practice, they trust the tools blindly a bit too
often.

Again in Ontario, I have some knowledge of the process used for
safety-critical software in nuclear power plants [I even have some grant
money associated to that].  Tools like Matlab or Maple would not be
allowed to give ``final'' answers, in any step of the process.  But this
is getting just a bit off-topic for the categories mailing-list...

Dear Categorists -

This issue of my column has an introduction to nonabelian cohomology
that some of you might enjoy.  You'll have to skip past some other
stuff to get to it.

Best,

This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics - Week 223
John Baez

This week I'd like to talk about two aspects of higher gauge theory:
p-form electromagnetism and nonabelian cohomology.  Lurking behind both
of these is the mathematics of n-categories, but I'll do my best to hide
that until the end, to build up the suspense.

But first, some cool pictures.  Astronomy is booming these days, and it's
a great way to see beautiful complexity emerging from simple laws in this
wonderful universe of ours.  So, I'd like the freedom to occasionally start
This Week's Finds with some pictures from the skies.  Think of it as an
appetizer before the main course.  Sometimes I'll explicitly relate these
pictures to math and physics; other times not.

Here's Saturn's moon Hyperion, photographed up close by the Cassini probe:

1) Cassini-Huyghens Mission, Hyperion: Odd World,
http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/image-details.cfm?imageID=1762

It seems to be a huge pile of rubble loosely held together by gravity and
heavily cratered by meteor bombardments.

Hyperion is interesting because it's the only known moon that tumbles
chaotically on a short time scale, thanks to its eccentric shape and
gravitational interactions with Saturn and Titan.

This leads to some interesting math.  We can think of Hyperion's angular
momentum vector as a point on a sphere.  If we started out knowing
this point lay inside some small disk, time evolution would warp this disk
into an ever more complicated region as time passed.  This region would
always have the same area, thanks to the wonders of symplectic geometry.
But it would sprout ever more complicated tendrils, with its perimeter
growing by a factor of e about every 100 days or so!

That's chaos for you.

Indeed, only quantum mechanics would stop the intricacy from growing forever,
by blurring it out.  After about 37 years, the area of a typical tendril
would equal Planck's constant.  At this point, classical mechanics would
no longer be accurate.  You'd really need to describe Hyperion's spin
state using quantum theory: for example, a holomorphic section of some
line bundle on the sphere.

Well... at least you would if it weren't for decoherence caused by the
interaction of Hyperion with its environment, for example solar radiation!
For an explanation of how this changes the story, try:

Perspectives on Divine Action, CTNS Publications, Vatican Observatory, 2001.

Here's another great picture:

3) The Hubble Heritage Project, Cat's Eye Nebula - NGC 6543,
http://heritage.stsci.edu/2004/27/index.html

This is a star about the size of the Sun, nearing the end of its life,
emitting pulses of gas and dust.  Astronomers call such a thing a
"planetary nebula", though it has nothing to do with planets.  It's in our
galaxy, about 3000 light years from us.  When it's done shedding its outer
layers, all that's left of this star will be a white dwarf.

Our own Sun will become a planetary nebula in about 6.9 billion years,
after two separate stages of being a red giant - one as it runs out
hydrogen, and one as it runs out of helium.  When the helium is all gone,
the Sun will start to pulsate every 100,000 years, ejecting more and more
mass in each pulse, eventually throwing off all but the hot inner core made
of heavier elements.  The astronomer Bruce Balick has written eloquently
on what this will mean for the Earth:

    Here on Earth, we'll feel the wind of the ejected gases sweeping
    past, slowly at first (a mere 5 miles per second!), and then
    picking up speed as the spasms continue - eventually to reach
    1000 miles per second!!  The remnant Sun will rise as a dot of
    intense light, no larger than Venus, more brilliant than 100
    present Suns, and an intensely hot blue-white color hotter than
    any welder's torch.  Light from the fiendish blue "pinprick"
    will braise the Earth and tear apart its surface molecules and
    atoms.  A new but very thin "atmosphere" of free electrons
    will form as the Earth's surface turns to dust.

So, don't keep procrastinating - enjoy life now!

Now... on to p-form electromagnetism!

In ordinary electromagnetism, the secret star of the show turns out
to be not the electromagnetic field but the "vector potential", A.
At least locally, we can think of this as a 1-form.  A 1-form is just
a gadget that you can integrate along a path and get a number.  In the
case of the vector potential, this number describes the change in
phase that a charged particle acquires as it moves along this path.

The 1-form A gives rise to a 2-form F called the "electromagnetic field".
A 2-form is a gadget you can integrate over a surface and get a
number.  Here's how we get F from A.  Suppose we move a charged particle
around a loop that's the boundary of some surface.   Then the integral
of F over this surface is defined to be the integral of A around the loop!
We summarize this by saying that F is the "exterior derivative" of A,
and writing

F = dA.

F is called the electromagnetic field because... that's what it is!
It contains both the electric and magnetic fields in a single neat
package.  In 4d spacetime, the magnetic field describes the change in
a phase of a charged particle that loops around a surface in the
xy, yz or zx planes.  The electric field describes the change in phase
of a charged particle that loops around a surface in the xt, yt or zt
planes.

If you don't know this stuff, you're missing some of the best fun
life has to offer.  For an easy introduction with lots of gorgeous
pictures, see:

6) Derek Wise, Electricity, magnetism and hypercubes, available at
http://math.ucr.edu/~derek/talks/050916bw.pdf

The idea of p-form electromagnetism is to replace point particles
by strings or higher-dimensional membranes.  To see how this goes,
it's enough to look at 2-form electromagnetism.

In 2-form electromagnetism, the star of the show is a 2-form, A.
As already mentioned, a 2-form is a gadget you can integrate over a
surface and get a number.  In 2-form electromagnetism, this number
describes the change in phase that a charged string acquires as it
moves along, tracing out a surface in spacetime.

The 2-form A gives rise to a 3-form, F.  A 3-form is a gadget
you can integrate over a 3-dimensional region and get a number.
Suppose we move a charged string and let it trace out a surface
that's the boundary of some 3-dimensional region.   Then the integral
of F over this region is defined to be the integral of A over the
surface!  Again we write this as:

F = dA.

So, we're just adding one to the dimensions of things.  This makes it
easy to keep on going.  In fact, for any integer p, we can write down
a generalization of Maxwell's equations.

It goes like this.  We start with a p-form A.  We define a (p+1)-form

F = dA

This automatically implies some of Maxwell's equations:

dF = 0

but the nontrivial Maxwell equations say that

*d*F = J

where * is the Hodge star operator and J is a p-form called the "current",
which is produced by charged matter.

What does this mean, physically?  The idea is that we have charged matter
consisting of (p-1)-dimensional membranes.  These trace out p-dimensional
surfaces in spacetime as time passes.  The current J is a p-form that's
concentrated on these surfaces.  The current affects the A field in a
manner governed by Maxwell's equations.  Conversely, the A field affects
the motion of the membranes.  Classically, we just integrate the A field
over the surface traced out by a membrane and add the result to the
*action* for the membrane.  In the path integral approach to quantum
mechanics, this number gives a change in phase, as already mentioned.

Maxwell's equations and their p-form generalization make sense when
spacetime is any Lorentzian manifold.  However, to get a theory
where initial data determine a unique global solution, we want our
spacetime to be "globally hyperbolic", which means that it has a
"Cauchy surface": roughly, a spacelike surface that any sufficiently
long timelike curve hits precisely once.  To get a good *quantum* theory
of p-form electromagnetism with a Hilbert space of states on which
time evolution acts as unitary operators, we need more: our spacetime
should be "stationary", meaning that it has time translation symmetry.
Otherwise there's no way to define energy and the vacuum state - which
is defined to be the least-energy state.

My student Miguel Carrion-Alvarez tackled an important special case
in his thesis, namely "static" globally hyperbolic spacetimes:

7) Miguel Carrion-Alvarez, Loop quantization versus Fock quantization
of p-form electromagnetism on static spacetimes, available as
math-ph/0412032.

There's a lot of interesting analysis involved, especially when space
(the Cauchy surface) is noncompact.  When it's compact, we can use
"Hodge's theorem" to relate its deRham cohomology to its topology,
and this turns out to be crucial for understanding p-form electromagnetism -
especially issues like the p-form Bohm-Aharonov effect.  When it's
noncompact we need something called "twisted L^2 cohomology" instead,
and Miguel proved a generalization of Hodge's theorem for this.

With the analysis under control, Miguel was able to set up a very
beautiful approach to  "loop quantum electromagnetism" and its p-form
generalization.  Here the idea is to write Maxwell's equations in terms
of the integrals of A around all possible loops in space - or more
generally, over all p-dimensional surfaces.  People interested in loop
quantum gravity should like this.

As you can guess, either from seeing all the "d" operators or seeing all
the buzzwords I'm throwing around, p-form electromagnetism is really just
cohomology incarnated as physics!  My student Derek Wise made this very
precise for a version of the theory where spacetime is *discrete* -
so-called "lattice p-form electromagnetism":

8) Derek Wise, Lattice p-form electromagnetism and chain field
theory, available as gr-qc/0510033.  Version with better graphics
and related material at http://math.ucr.edu/~derek/pform/index.html

In this paper, he shows lattice p-form electromagnetism is a "chain
field theory": something like a topological quantum field theory, but
where what matters is not spacetime itself so much as the cochain
complex of differential forms *on* spacetime, equipped with just enough
extra geometrical structure to write down the p-form version of Maxwell's
equations.

Both Miguel's thesis and Derek's papers are great if you want to learn
lots of math and physics.  I seem to attract students who enjoy explaining
things.

Speaking of which....

Next I want to explain some stuff Danny Stevenson told me at a mall in the
little town of Cabazon while we were recovering from a hike in the desert
followed by pancakes at the Wheel Inn - a roadside restaurant famous for
its enormous statues of dinosaurs.

Danny works on gerbes, stacks, and higher gauge theory.  Last year we
wrote a paper with Alissa Crans and Urs Schreiber constructing 2-groups
(categorified groups) from the math of string theory - more precisely,
from central extensions of loop groups.  Since then I've been spending a
lot of time writing a paper with Urs on higher gauge theory, where we set
up a theory of parallel transport along surfaces.  2-form electromagnetism
is the simplest case of this theory.  Meanwhile, Danny has been thinking
about connections on 2-vector bundles and their relation to the cohomology
of Lie 2-algebras.

This has led him to generalize Schreier theory in some interesting ways.
So, let me tell you about Schreier theory!

Schreier theory is a way to classify short exact sequences of groups.
I'll say what I mean by that in a minute... but what makes Schreier theory
special is that avoids some simplifying assumptions you might have seen
if you've studied short exact sequences before.

Normally people water down their short exact sequences by assuming some
of the groups in question are *abelian*.  This lets them use "cohomology
theory" to do the classification.  See "week210" for a nice book that
takes this approach.

This standard approach is great - I'm not knocking it - but Schreier theory
is more general: it's really a branch of "nonabelian cohomology theory".
It's not all that hard to explain, either.  So, I'll explain it and then
talk about various simplifying assumptions people make.

The goal of Schreier theory is to classify short exact sequences of groups:

1 -> F -> E -> B -> 1

for a given choice of F and B.  "Exact" means that the arrows stand
for homomorphisms and the image of each arrow is the kernel of the next.
Here this just means that F is a normal subgroup of E and B is the quotient
group E/F.  Such a short exact sequence is also called an "extension of B
by F", since E is bigger than B and contains F.  The simplest choice is to
let E be the direct sum of F and B.  Usually there are other more interesting
extensions as well.

To classify these, the trick is to use the analogy between group theory
and topology.

As I explained in "week213", you can think of a group as a watered-down
version of a connected space with a chosen point.  The reason is that
given such a space, we get a group consisting of homotopy classes of
loops based at the chosen point.  This is called the "fundamental group"
of our space.  There's a lot more information in our space than this group.
But pretty much anything you can do for groups, you can do for such spaces.
It's usually harder, but it's completely analogous!

In particular, classifying short exact sequences is a lot like
classifying "fibrations":

1 -> F -> E -> B -> 1

where now the letters stand for connected spaces with a chosen point, and
the arrows stand for continuous maps.   If you're a physicist or geometer
you may prefer fiber bundles to "fibrations" - but luckily, they're so
similar we can ignore the difference in a vague discussion like this.
The idea is basically just that E maps onto B, and sitting over each point
of B we have a copy of F.  We call B the "base space", E the "total space"
and F the "fiber".

If we want to classify such fibrations we can consider carrying the fiber
F around a loop in B and see how it twists around.  For example, if all our
spaces are smooth manifolds, we can pick a connection on the total space
E and see what parallel transport around a loop in the base space B does
to points in the fiber F.  This gives a kind of homomorphism

Omega(B) -> Aut(F)

sending loops in B to invertible maps from F to itself.  And, the cool
thing is: this homomorphism lets us classify the fibration!

Here I say "kind of homomorphism" since Omega(B), the space of loops in B
based at the chosen point, is only "kind of" a topological group: the
group laws only hold up to homotopy.  But let's not worry about this
technicality  - especially since I'm being vague about all sorts of other
equally important issues!

The reason I can get away with not worrying about these issues is that
I'm trying to explain a very robust powerful principle - one that can
easily survive a dose of vagueness that would kill a lesser idea.  Namely,
if B is a connected space with a chosen basepoint,

               FIBRATIONS OVER THE BASE SPACE B WITH FIBER F
                          ARE "THE SAME" AS
         HOMOMORPHISMS SENDING LOOPS IN B TO AUTOMORPHISMS OF F.

This could be called "the basic principle of Galois theory", for reasons
explained in "week213".  There I explained the special case where the
fiber is discrete.  Then our fibration called a "covering space", and
the basic principle of Galois theory boils down to this:

                    COVERING SPACES OVER B WITH FIBER F
                           ARE "THE SAME" AS
    HOMOMORPHISMS FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF B TO AUTOMORPHISMS OF F.

Okay.  Now let's use the same principle to classify extensions of a group
B by a group F:

1 -> F -> E -> B -> 1

The group B here acts like "loops in the base".  But what acts like
"automorphisms of the fiber"?

You might guess it's the group of automorphisms of F.  But, it's
actually the *2-group* of automorphisms of F!

A 2-group is a categorified version of a group where all the usual group
laws hold up to natural isomorphism.  They play a role in higher gauge
theory like that of groups in ordinary gauge theory.  In higher gauge
theory, parallel transport along a path is described by an *object* in
a 2-group, while parallel transport along a path-of-paths is described
by a *morphism*.  In 2-form electromagnetism we use a very simple "abelian"
2-group, which has one object and either the real line or the circle as
morphism.  But there are other more interesting "nonabelian" examples.

If you want to learn more about 2-form electromagnetism from this
perspective, try "week210".  For 2-groups in general, try this paper:

9) John Baez and Aaron Lauda, Higher-dimensional algebra V: 2-groups,
Theory and Applications of Categories 12 (2004), 423-491. Available online at
http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/12/14/12-14abs.html or as math.QA/0307200.

Anyway: it turns out that any group F gives a 2-group AUT(F) where the
objects are automorphisms of F and the morphisms are "conjugations" -
elements of F acting to conjugate one automorphism and yield another.
And, extensions

1 -> F -> E -> B -> 1

are classified by homomorphisms

B -> AUT(F)

where we think of B as a 2-group with only identity morphisms.  More
precisely:

                EXTENSIONS OF THE GROUP B BY THE GROUP F
                            ARE "THE SAME" AS
               HOMOMORPHISMS FROM B TO THE 2-GROUP AUT(F)

It's fun to work out the details, but it's probably not a good use of
our time together grinding through them here.   So, I'll just sketch
how it works.

Starting with our extension

         i     p
1 --> F --> E --> B --> 1

we pick a "section"

                s
            E <-- B

meaning a function with

p(s(b)) = b

for all b in B.  We can find a section because p is onto.  However,
the section usually *isn't* a homomorphism.

Given the section s, we get a function

alpha: B -> Aut(F)

where Aut(F) is the group of automorphisms of F.  Here's how:

alpha(b) f = s(b) f s(b)^{-1}

However, usually alpha *isn't* a homomorphism.

So far this seems a bit sad: functions between groups want to be
homomorphisms.  But, we can measure how much s fails to be a homomorphism
using the function

g: B^2 -> F

given by

g(b,b') = s(bb') s(b')^{-1} s(b)^{-1}

Note that g = 1 iff s is a homomorphism.

We can then use this function g to save alpha.  The sad thing about
alpha is that it's not a homomorphism... but the good thing is, it's
a homomorphism up to conjugation by g!  In other words:

alpha(bb') f = g(b,b') [alpha(b) alpha(b') f] g(b,b')^{-1}

Taken together, alpha and g satisfy some equations ("cocycle conditions")
which say precisely that they form a homomorphism from B to the 2-group
AUT(F).  Conversely, any such homomorphism gives an extension of B by F.

In fact, isomorphism classes of extensions of B by F correspond
in a 1-1 way with isomorphism classes of homorphisms from B to AUT(F).
So, we've classified these extensions!

In fact, something even better is true!  It's evil to "decategorify" by
taking isomorphism classes as we did in the previous paragraph.  To avoid
this, we can form a groupoid whose objects are extensions of B by F, and a
groupoid whose objects are homomorphisms B -> AUT(F).  I'm pretty sure
that if you form these groupoids in the obvious way, they're equivalent.
And that's what this slogan really means:

                EXTENSIONS OF THE GROUP B BY THE GROUP F
                            ARE "THE SAME" AS
               HOMOMORPHISMS FROM B TO THE 2-GROUP AUT(F)

Next, let me say how Schreier theory reduces to more familiar ideas in two
special cases.

People have thought a lot about the special case where F is abelian and
lies in the center of E.  These are called "central extensions".  This
is just the case where alpha = 1.  The set of isomorphism classes of
central extensions is called H^2(B,F) - the "second cohomology" of B
with coefficients in F.

People have also thought about "abelian extensions".  That's an even
more special case where all three groups are abelian.  The set of
isomorphism classes of such extensions is called Ext(B,F).

Since we don't make any simplifying assumptions like this in Schreier
theory, it's part of a subject called "nonabelian cohomology".  It was
actually worked out by Dedecker in the 1960's, based on much earlier
work by Schreier:

10) O. Schreier, Ueber die Erweiterung von Gruppen I, Monatschefte fur
Mathematik and Physick 34 (1926), 165-180.  Ueber die Erweiterung von
Gruppen II, Abh. Math. Sem. Hamburg 4 (1926), 321-346.

11) P. Dedecker, Les foncteuers Ext_Pi, H^2_Pi and H^2_Pi non abeliens,
C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 258 (1964), 4891-4895.

More recently, Schreier theory was pushed one step up the categorical
ladder by Larry Breen.  As far as I can tell, he essentially classified
the extensions of a 2-group B by a 2-group F in terms of homomorphisms
B -> AUT(F), where AUT(F) is the *3-group* of automorphisms of F:

12) Lawrence Breen, Theorie de Schreier superieure, Ann. Sci. Ecole Norm.
Sup. 25 (1992), 465-514.  Also available at
http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?id=ASENS_1992_4_25_5

We can keep pushing Schreier theory upwards like this, but we can also
expand it "sideways" by replacing groups with groupoids.  You should have
been annoyed by how I kept assuming my topological spaces were connected
and equipped with a specified point.   I did this to make them analogous
to groups.  For example, it's only spaces like this for which the fundamental
group is sufficiently powerful to classify covering spaces.  For more general
spaces, we should use the fundamental *groupoid* instead of the fundamental
group.  And, we can set up a Schreier theory for extensions of groupoids:

13) V. Blanco, M. Bullejos and E. Faro, Categorical non abelian cohomology,
and the Schreier theory of groupoids, available as math.CT/0410202.

In fact, these authors note that Grothendieck did something similar
back in 1971: he classified *all* groupoids fibered over a groupoid
B in terms of weak 2-functors from B to Gpd, which is the 2-groupoid of
groupoids!  The point here is that Gpd contains AUT(F) for any fixed
groupoid F:

14) Alexander Grothendieck, Categories fibrees et descente (SGA I),
Lecture Notes in Mathematics 224, Springer, Berlin, 1971.

Having extended the idea "sideways" like this, one can then continue
marching "upwards".  I don't know how much work has been done on this,
but the slogan should be something like this:

                  n-GROUPOIDS FIBERED OVER AN n-GROUPOID B
                             ARE "THE SAME" AS
            WEAK (n+1)-FUNCTORS FROM B TO THE (n+1)-GROUPOID nGpd

Grothendieck also studied this kind of thing with categories replacing
groupoids, so there should also be an n-category version, I think...
but it's more delicate to define "fibrations" for categories than
for groupoids, so I'm a bit scared to state a slogan suitable for
n-categories.

However, I'm not scared to go from n-groupoids to omega-groupoids, which
are basically the same as spaces.  In terms of spaces, the slogan goes
like this:

                        SPACES FIBERED OVER THE SPACE B
                               ARE "THE SAME" AS
                    MAPS FROM B TO THE SPACE OF ALL SPACES

This is how James Dolan taught it to me.  Most mortals are scared of "the
space of all spaces" - both for fear of Russell's paradox, and because we
really need a *space* of all spaces, not just a mere set of them.  To avoid
these terrors, you can water down Jim's slogan by choosing a specific space
F to be the fiber:

                  FIBRATIONS WITH FIBER F OVER THE SPACE B
                             ARE "THE SAME" AS
                MAPS FROM B TO THE CLASSIFYING SPACE OF AUT(F)

where AUT(F) is the topological group of homotopy self-equivalences of F.
The fearsome "space of all spaces" is then the disjoint union of the
classifying spaces of all these topological groups AUT(F).  It's too large
to be a space unless you pass to a larger universe of sets, but otherwise
it's perfectly fine.  Grothendieck invented the notion of a "Grothendieck
universe" for precisely this purpose:

In his posting today, John Baez advertised the slogan:

             FIBRATIONS OVER THE BASE SPACE B WITH FIBER F
                          ARE "THE SAME" AS
         HOMOMORPHISMS SENDING LOOPS IN B TO AUTOMORPHISMS OF F.

He hedged it with a ``dose of vagueness'', but in fact I proved a
completely precise and general version of exactly this result in
``Classifying spaces and fibrations'', Memoirs AMS 155, Jan. 1975. Using
Moore loops on B, LB, one has a topological monoid, and one also has the
topological monoid Aut(F) of homotopy equivalences of $F$. A ``transport''
is a homomorphism of topological monoids from LB to Aut(F).  Allowing F to
vary by a homotopy equivalence, one can define an equivalence relation on
transports such that the equivalence classes are in natural bijective
correspondence with the equivalence classes of `fibrations over the base
space B with fiber F'.  One can generalize the context by allowing fibers
in some nice category and prove the same result.  See opus cit, Theorem
14.2, page 83. That was over 30 years ago, so naturally I wasn't thinking
about categorification, but I would imagine that the methods categorify.


Some questions from more recent work (in progress in fact):

1.  In work on (equivariant, stable) parametrized homotopy theory,
Johann Sigurdsson and I need and develop duality in ``symmetric
bicategories B'', which are not to be confused with the reasonably
standard symmetric monoidal bicategories.  Rather there must be a
prescribed involution on the bicategory B, a pseudo-equivalence t
between  B  and  its opposite bicategory (not completely general:
we find it helpful to require tt = id on 0-cells).  For example, the
standard bicategory whose 0-cells are rings, whose 1-cells R >--> S are
(S,R)-bimodules, and whose 2-cells are maps of bimodules is symmetric;
t takes R to its opposite ring and takes an (S,R)-bimodule to the same
Abelian group regarded as a (tR,tS)-bimodule.  Is there a pre-existing
theory of such bicategories and their duality theory, analogous to
duality theory in symmetric monoidal categories?

2.  The example in 1 is additionally a symmetric monoidal bicategory
under the tensor product over Z, and there is an analogous bicategory
starting with a commutative ground ring replacing Z.  These assemble
nicely into a tricategory of commutative rings, algebras, bimodules,
and maps of bimodules.  Moreover, the bicategory in 1 is actually part
of a pseudo double category with maps of algebras as vertical 1-cells.
Promoting this to the tricategory just mentioned, one has maps of
commutative rings as vertical 1-cells and maps of algebras as
vertical 2-cells.  I don't know a name for the resulting notion,
something like a pseudo triple category.  Here again, what is most
important is duality theory.  Has anybody studied such structures?
There are derived versions of the cited example, and such structures
also appear naturally in our work on parametrized homotopy theory.
Thankfully, we do not (yet) seem to need tetracategories!

Hi,

Can anyone tell me the motivation for the use of the term
"distributors" as a synonym for profunctors/bimodules?  Is there
something being distributed?

Thanks,
Mike

Even more ancient:

Parallel transport in fibre spaces," Bol. Soc. Mat. Mexicana (1968), 68-86.

Unfortunately that's a hard paper to get a hold of

somewhat related is

Associated fibre spaces," Michigan Math. Journal 15 (1968), 457-470.

and at the survey level

 H-spaces and classifying spaces, I-IV", AMS Proc. Symp. Pure Math.
22 (1971), 247-272.

Of course, as you might expect, I describe things in terms of
A_\infty-morphisms
from the space of loops into

Aut(F) of homotopy equivalences of $F$

Now that some of us are comfortable with A_\infty-cats,
categborification should proceed
perhaps with some technical details.

John Baez gave an interesting account of nonabelian cohomology and
extension theory. Here are a few more references with which I have been
involved,  all using crossed complexes and free crossed resolutions:

1) (with P.J. HIGGINS), ``Crossed complexes and non-abelian
extensions'', {\em Category theory proceedings, Gummersbach},
1981, Lecture  Notes in Math. 962 (ed. K.H. Kamps et al, Springer,
Berlin, 1982), pp.  39-50.

This generalises classical Schreier theory to extensions of groupoids.

2)   (with O. MUCUK), ``Covering groups of non-connected
topological  groups revisited'',  {\em Math. Proc. Camb. Phil.
Soc},  115 (1994) 97-110.

This relates the theory of covering topological groups of non connected
topological groups to the classical theory of extensions and
obstructions to a Q-kernel with an invariant in H^3. It uses the
properties of the internal hom in crossed complexes CRS(F,C) , and exact
sequences derived from a fibration C \to D and the induced fibration on
CRS(F, -).

3) (with T. PORTER), ``On the Schreier theory of non-abelian
extensions: generalisations and computations''. {\em Proceedings
Royal Irish Academy} 96A (1996) 213-227.

This establises a generalisation of the Schreier theory in two ways (but
only for groups). One is using coefficients in a crossed module,
following Dedecker's key ideas, as in the references in John's account.
Second it shows how to compute with such extensions

A \to E \to G

in terms of presentations of the group G.  This involves identities
among relations for the presentation, as shown originally by Turing in

Turing, A. 1938. The extensions of a group. {\em Compositio
Mathematica.} {\bf 5 }  357-367

The advantage of this method is that one can actually do sums, even when
the group G may be infinite. The example given by us is G= trefoil group
with two generators x,y and relation x^3=y^2. This presentation has no
identities among relations, and so the calculation is especially simple.
Equivalence of extensions is described in terms of homotopies of
morphisms of crossed complexes, and this relates the ideas to other
forms of homological or homotopical algebra.

An advantage of this approach is the ability to calculate some small
free crossed resolutions of some groups: this is one reason for using
crossed complexes. Note that a convenient monoidal closed structure on
the category of crossed complexes has been explicitly written down, and
this allows convenient calculation and representations of homotopies,
using the `unit interval' groupid, as a crossed complex.

One of the problems I have with the globular approach is the difficulty
of writing down homotopies, and higher homotopies. For example, Ilhan
Icen and I found it difficult to rewrite in terms of group-groupoids the
well known Whitehead theory of automorphisms of crossed modules,
explained for the crossed modules of groupoids case in

(with \.I. \.I\c cen ), `Homotopies and automorphisms of crossed modules
of groupoids', Applied Categorical Structures,  11 (2003) 185-206.

It looks as if it would be better expressed in terms of automorphisms of
2-groupoids: good marks to anyone who writes it down in that way!

One knows such homotopies  of globular infinity groupoids exist because
globular  infinity-groupoids are equivalent to crossed complexes

 (with P.J. HIGGINS), ``The equivalence of $\infty$-groupoids and
crossed  complexes'', {\em Cah. Top. G\'eom. Diff.} 22 (1981) 371-386.

(This paper contains an early definition of a (strict, globular)
infinity category.)

This raises a question: what is the crossed complex associated to the
free globular groupoid on one generator of dimension n? I have a
round-about sketch proof, using also cubical theory, and a van Kampen
theorem,  that it *is* the fundamental crossed complex of the n-globe.
Does anyone have a purely  algebraic proof?

The idea of singular nonabelian cohomology of a space X with
coefficients in a crossed complex C is given in

(with P.J.HIGGINS), ``The classifying space of a crossed complex'',
{\em Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.} 110 (1991) 95-120.

This cohomology is give by [\Pi SX, C], homotopy classes of maps from
the fundamental crossed complex of the singular complex of X, to C.
There is also a Cech version (current work with Jim Glazebrook and Tim
Porter).

An interesting problem is to classify extensions of crossed complexes!

There is an interesting account  of extensions of principal bundles and
transitive Lie groupoids by Androulidakis, developing work of Mackenzie,
at math.DG/0402007 (not using crossed complexes).

I took the liberty of circulating to our Math Dept Andrej Bauer's
message which included the example

>>
>> Limit[((1 + 4 x^2)^(1/4) - (1 + 5 x^2)^(1/5))/(a^(-x^2/2) - Cos[x]),
>>       x -> 0]

In retaliation my colleague Alf van der Poorten commented as below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Ross,

I've long said that "mathematics ain't about getting it right but
about not getting it wrong". Our students of course think that we
teach them methods/algorithms/recipes for getting it right ---
indeed, we often give them partial reward just for seeming to have
started to attempt to use some reasonable way that might possibly
have led them to a correct answer. In that context looking it up or
having a machine look it up (or asking/copying from a wise friend) is
a perfectly fine recipe for maybe getting it right.

The trick is verifying that it is indeed very likely right (or,
occasionally, actually \emph{is} right) and much better yet, noticing
that it is wrong or that there are grounds for suspicion warranting
their consulting a dinkum mathematician to get the good oil.

By the way, the particular limit cited didn't tempt me towards error
at all: Almost automatically I scribbled $(1+4x^2)^{1/4}=1+x^2+\ldots
\,$, and so on, realising a line or so later that I had better warm
up those $\ldots\,$ to $-\frac32x^4+\ldots\,$, and so on. I hadn't
realised that I was checking whether some zero is isolated and am
sorry to learn that I might have been.

Ideally our students will learn from us to see when they've surely
got it wrong and, more subtly, when they might well possibly have got
it wrong ("Yup, it does indeed work for $a=1$ but, oops! Why is there
an unspecified $a$ at all? I'd better phone a mathematician to ask
--- hoping she does something sensible such as reminding me of Taylor
expansions rather than waffling about isolated zeros.").
Unfortunately, as always, distinguishing right from wrong requires
quite a bit of knowledge (both of what's right and of what isn't)
that students are often slow in acquiring.

This brings to mind an interesting (but insufficiently well known)
treatment by I htink) Dennis Johnson of  extensions
A \to E \to G
of topological groups which are also principal bundles

the classification of such extensions fits into an exact sequence

X --> Y  --> Z
where Z classifies the bundle - forgetting the group structure
and  X is the appropriate H^2 classifying split topolgocical
group extensions i.e. A x G as bundles

I don't quite understand who is retaliating for what in the posted comment.

Even though this is not strictly speaking category theory, I will take
the further liberty to tell you the whole story.

The above limit cropped up when I told my students in "Computer Science
I" to bring examples of problems they do in Analysis and Algebra. The
idea was to solve them using Mathematica. Someone bought the above
limit, except that instead of the parameter 'a' he had the constant 'e'
(base of natural logarithm). Now, as it happens, in Mathematica this
constant is written 'E' instead of 'e'. The student of course typed in
'e' which Mathematica took as a "free parameter" and gave the "generic"
answer 0, while the correct answer was 6. It took a while to explain the
whole mess. I suspect the only thing the students learned was that (a)
the limit is stupid, (b) Mathematica is stupid and (c) the teacher is a
pedantic fanatic.

By the way, to see what is going on in the above limit, draw a family of
functions for various values of 'a' approaching and passing through a=e.
All will be clear as you see two "waves" passing through each other.

I guess I am trying to point out that current Computer Alegbra Systems
are very tricky to use _correctly_. In Mathematica's defense it should
be said that it also found a couple of errors where the Analsyis teacher
did not (one involved cancelling "a common factor of b" between b^2 and
sqrt(b^2) for a real parameter b).

In reply to P. May's message.

I do not know of any work on "pseudo triple category".

On the other hand, the pseudo double category  Rng  of rings, =20
homomorphisms and bimodules
is briefly considered in our first work on pseudo double categories, =20
subsection 5.3

    M. Grandis - R. Par=E9, Limits in double categories, Cah. Topol. =20
G=E9om. Diff. Cat=E9g. 40 (1999), 162-220

as a substructure of the  pseudo double category of Ab-categories, Ab-=20=

functors and Ab-profunctors.

As an interesting construction, in this pseudo double category:
- the "tabulator" of a bimodule  u: R -+-> S  (u  is a left-R,  right-=20=

S  bimodule) (i.e., its double limit) can be constructed as a ring of =20=

triangular 2x2 matrices, with "matrix product"

   r  x     r'  x'        rr'   rx'+xs'
         .           =3D
   0  s     0   s'        0       ss'

(with  r. r' in R,  s, s' in S  and  x, x'  in  u).

Tabulators are crucial for double limits, since all of them can be =20
constructed from double products, double equalisers and tabulators.
[  In a bicategory, the tabulator (of the vertical identity of A) is =20
the cotensor  2*A,  and the previous result amounts to the =20
construction of weighted limits, in
   R.H. Street, Limits indexed by category valued 2-functors, J. Pure =20=

Appl. Algebra 8 (1976), 149-181.  ]


Best regards

Thanks to everyone who replied to my email.  The consensus from people
who claim to know (although there were some plausible guesses) is that
the name is by analogy with "distributions" from functional analysis,
which are "generalized functions."  Thus changing "ion" to "or" we get
that "distributors" are "generalized functors."

 It's certainly old, but I mentioned another that may be older:

                    COVERING SPACES OVER B WITH FIBER F
                           ARE "THE SAME" AS
    HOMOMORPHISMS FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF B TO AUTOMORPHISMS OF F.

 although one usually sees this special case (which I didn't bother
 to mention):

                 CONNECTED COVERING SPACES OVER B WITH FIBER F
                            ARE "THE SAME" AS
            TRANSITIVE ACTIONS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF B ON F

 which is usually disguised as follows:

                 CONNECTED COVERING SPACES OVER B
                           ARE "THE SAME" AS
               SUBGROUPS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF B

 Anyway, I wasn't trying to present things in historical order.
 I was trying present them roughly in order of increasing
 "dimension", starting with extensions of groups, then going up to
 2-groups, then expanding out to groupoids, then going up to n-groupoids,
 and finally omega-groupoids... which are the same as homotopy types!

 And here, as usual, the n-category theorists meet up with the
 topologists - and find that the topologists have already done everything
 there is to do with omega-groupoids ... but usually by thinking of
 them of them as *spaces*, rather than omega-groupoids!

 It's sort of like climbing a mountain, surmounting steep cliffs with
 the help of ropes and other equipment, and then finding a Holiday Inn
 on top and realizing there was a 4-lane highway going up the other side.

 So, as usual, the main point of calling homotopy types "omega-groupoids"
 instead of "spaces" is not to reinvent topology, but to see how ideas
 from topology generalize to n-category theory.  Think of spaces as
 omega-groupoids but use those as a springboard for omega-categories -
 or at least n-categories, perhaps just for low values of n if one is
 feeling tired.

 In the case at hand, the omega-groupoidal slogan:

               FIBRATIONS OF OMEGA-GROUPOIDS WITH FIBER F AND BASE B
                               ARE "THE SAME" AS
                       WEAK OMEGA-FUNCTORS FROM B TO AUT(F)

 is just a reformulation of:

                  FIBRATIONS WITH FIBER F OVER THE SPACE B
                             ARE "THE SAME" AS
                 MAPS FROM B TO THE CLASSIFYING SPACE OF AUT(F)

 but it suggests a grandiose generalization:

               FIBRATIONS OF OMEGA-CATEGORIES WITH BASE B
                            ARE "THE SAME" AS
   WEAK OMEGA-FUNCTORS FROM B^{op} TO THE OMEGA-CATEGORY OF OMEGA-CATEGORIES!

 I guess we can thank Grothendieck for making precise and proving a
 version of this with omega replaced by n = 1:

                      FIBRATIONS OF CATEGORIES WITH BASE B
                               ARE "THE SAME" AS
            WEAK 2-FUNCTORS FROM B^{op} TO THE 2-CATEGORY OF CATEGORIES.

 More recently people have been thinking about the n = 2 case, especially
 Claudio Hermida:

 22) Claudio Hermida, Descent on 2-fibrations and strongly 2-regular
 2-categories, Applied Categorical Structures, 12 (2004), 427-459.
 Also available at http://maggie.cs.queensu.ca/chermida/papers/2-descent.pdf

 He states something that hints at this:

                      FIBRATIONS OF 2-CATEGORIES WITH BASE B
                               ARE "THE SAME" AS
         WEAK 3-FUNCTORS FROM B^{op} TO THE WEAK 3-CATEGORY OF 2-CATEGORIES.

 where I'm using B^{op} to mean B with the directions of both 1-morphisms
 and 2-morphisms reversed.

 (Hermida follows tradition and calls this B^{coop} - "op" for reversing
 1-morphisms and "co" for reversing 2-morphisms.  But, it looks like we'll
 be needing to reverse all kinds of morphisms in n-category case, so we'll
 need a short name for that.)

 Best,
 jb

John and anyone else who cares to weigh in,
here are some comments from the purely topological
or rather homtopy theory side:

For both bundles and fibrations (e.g. over a paracompact base), your
last slogan is the oldest:

  FIBRATIONS WITH FIBER F OVER THE SPACE B
                             ARE "THE SAME" AS
                MAPS FROM B TO THE CLASSIFYING SPACE OF AUT(F)

`the same as' referring to homotopy classes

For bundles, Aut(F) now means the structure group of the bundle

This standard approach is great - I'm not knocking it - but Schreier theory
is more general: it's really a branch of "nonabelian cohomology theory".
It's not all that hard to explain, either.  So, I'll explain it and then
talk about various simplifying assumptions people make.

The goal of Schreier theory is to classify short exact sequences of groups:

1 -> F -> E -> B -> 1

for a given choice of F and B.  "Exact" means that the arrows stand
for homomorphisms and the image of each arrow is the kernel of the next.
Here this just means that F is a normal subgroup of E and B is the quotient
group E/F.  Such a short exact sequence is also called an "extension of B
by F", since E is bigger than B and contains F.  The simplest choice is to
let E be the direct sum of F and B.  Usually there are other more
interesting
extensions as well.

To classify these, the trick is to use the analogy between group theory
and topology.

As I explained in "week213", you can think of a group as a watered-down
version of a connected space with a chosen point.  The reason is that
given such a space, we get a group consisting of homotopy classes of
loops based at the chosen point.  This is called the "fundamental group"
of our space.  There's a lot more information in our space than this group.
But pretty much anything you can do for groups, you can do for such spaces.
It's usually harder, but it's completely analogous!

In particular, classifying short exact sequences is a lot like
classifying "fibrations":

1 -> F -> E -> B -> 1

where now the letters stand for connected spaces with a chosen point, and
the arrows stand for continuous maps.   If you're a physicist or geometer
you may prefer fiber bundles to "fibrations" - but luckily, they're so
similar we can ignore the difference in a vague discussion like this.
The idea is basically just that E maps onto B, and sitting over each point
of B we have a copy of F.  We call B the "base space", E the "total space"
and F the "fiber".

If we want to classify such fibrations we can consider carrying the fiber
F around a loop in B and see how it twists around.  For example, if all our
spaces are smooth manifolds, we can pick a connection on the total space
E and see what parallel transport around a loop in the base space B does
to points in the fiber F.  This gives a kind of homomorphism

Omega(B) -> Aut(F)

sending loops in B to invertible maps from F to itself.  And, the cool
thing is: this homomorphism lets us classify the fibration!

Here I say "kind of homomorphism" since Omega(B), the space of loops in B
based at the chosen point, is only "kind of" a topological group: the
group laws only hold up to homotopy.

As Peter May points out, you can use the strict monoid of Moore loops
instead of Poincare's, but kind of homomorphism" still does not mean strict
but rather A-\infty map even though both domain and range are strictly
associative

So intrepreted, the equivalence with B --> Aut F is clear.

If you wnat a strict homomorphism, try using a classical connection -
at least in the smooth case.

 But let's not worry about this
technicality  - especially since I'm being vague about all sorts of other
equally important issues!

The reason I can get away with not worrying about these issues is that
I'm trying to explain a very robust powerful principle - one that can
easily survive a dose of vagueness that would kill a lesser idea.  Namely,
if B is a connected space with a chosen basepoint,

               FIBRATIONS OVER THE BASE SPACE B WITH FIBER F
                          ARE "THE SAME" AS
         HOMOMORPHISMS SENDING LOOPS IN B TO AUTOMORPHISMS OF F.

This could be called "the basic principle of Galois theory", for reasons
explained in "week213".  There I explained the special case where the
fiber is discrete.  Then our fibration called a "covering space", and
the basic principle of Galois theory boils down to this:

                    COVERING SPACES OVER B WITH FIBER F
                           ARE "THE SAME" AS
    HOMOMORPHISMS FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF B TO AUTOMORPHISMS OF F.

Okay.  Now let's use the same principle to classify extensions of a group
B by a group F:

1 -> F -> E -> B -> 1

The group B here acts like "loops in the base".  But what acts like
"automorphisms of the fiber"?

You might guess it's the group of automorphisms of F.  But, it's
actually the *2-group* of automorphisms of F!

A 2-group is a categorified version of a group where all the usual group
laws hold up to natural isomorphism.  They play a role in higher gauge
theory like that of groups in ordinary gauge theory.  In higher gauge
theory, parallel transport along a path is described by an *object* in
a 2-group, while parallel transport along a path-of-paths is described
by a *morphism*.  In 2-form electromagnetism we use a very simple "abelian"
2-group, which has one object and either the real line or the circle as
morphism.  But there are other more interesting "nonabelian" examples.

If you want to learn more about 2-form electromagnetism from this
perspective, try "week210".  For 2-groups in general, try this paper:

9) John Baez and Aaron Lauda, Higher-dimensional algebra V: 2-groups,
Theory and Applications of Categories 12 (2004), 423-491. Available
online at
http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/12/14/12-14abs.html or as math.QA/0307200.

Anyway: it turns out that any group F gives a 2-group AUT(F) where the
objects are automorphisms of F and the morphisms are "conjugations" -

and conjugations correspond to homtopies at the classifying space level

elements of F acting to conjugate one automorphism and yield another.
And, extensions

1 -> F -> E -> B -> 1

are classified by homomorphisms

B -> AUT(F)

where we think of B as a 2-group with only identity morphisms.  More
precisely:

                EXTENSIONS OF THE GROUP B BY THE GROUP F
                            ARE "THE SAME" AS
               HOMOMORPHISMS FROM B TO THE 2-GROUP AUT(F)

It's fun to work out the details, but it's probably not a good use of
our time together grinding through them here.   So, I'll just sketch
how it works.

Starting with our extension

         i     p
1 --> F --> E --> B --> 1

we pick a "section"

                s
            E <-- B

meaning a function with

p(s(b)) = b

for all b in B.  We can find a section because p is onto.  However,
the section usually *isn't* a homomorphism.

Given the section s, we get a function

alpha: B -> Aut(F)

where Aut(F) is the group of automorphisms of F.  Here's how:

alpha(b) f = s(b) f s(b)^{-1}

However, usually alpha *isn't* a homomorphism.

So far this seems a bit sad: functions between groups want to be
homomorphisms.  But, we can measure how much s fails to be a homomorphism
using the function

g: B2 -> F

given by

g(b,b') = s(bb') s(b')^{-1} s(b)^{-1}

Note that g = 1 iff s is a homomorphism.

We can then use this function g to save alpha.  The sad thing about
alpha is that it's not a homomorphism... but the good thing is, it's
a homomorphism up to conjugation by g!  In other words:

alpha(bb') f = g(b,b') [alpha(b) alpha(b') f] g(b,b')^{-1}

Taken together, alpha and g satisfy some equations ("cocycle conditions")
which say precisely that they form a homomorphism from B to the 2-group
AUT(F).  Conversely, any such homomorphism gives an extension of B by F.

In fact, isomorphism classes of extensions of B by F correspond
in a 1-1 way with isomorphism classes of homorphisms from B to AUT(F).
So, we've classified these extensions!

In fact, something even better is true!  It's evil to "decategorify" by
taking isomorphism classes as we did in the previous paragraph.  To avoid
this, we can form a groupoid whose objects are extensions of B by F, and a
groupoid whose objects are homomorphisms B -> AUT(F).  I'm pretty sure
that if you form these groupoids in the obvious way, they're equivalent.
And that's what this slogan really means:

                EXTENSIONS OF THE GROUP B BY THE GROUP F
                            ARE "THE SAME" AS
               HOMOMORPHISMS FROM B TO THE 2-GROUP AUT(F)

Ah, your 2-group must be hiding my homotopies - I'd love to see that

Next, let me say how Schreier theory reduces to more familiar ideas in two
special cases.

People have thought a lot about the special case where F is abelian and
lies in the center of E.  These are called "central extensions".  This
is just the case where alpha = 1.  The set of isomorphism classes of
central extensions is called H2(B,F) - the "second cohomology" of B
with coefficients in F.

People have also thought about "abelian extensions".  That's an even
more special case where all three groups are abelian.  The set of
isomorphism classes of such extensions is called Ext(B,F).

Since we don't make any simplifying assumptions like this in Schreier
theory, it's part of a subject called "nonabelian cohomology".  It was
actually worked out by Dedecker in the 1960's, based on much earlier
work by Schreier:

10) O. Schreier, Ueber die Erweiterung von Gruppen I, Monatschefte fur
Mathematik and Physick 34 (1926), 165-180.  Ueber die Erweiterung von
Gruppen II, Abh. Math. Sem. Hamburg 4 (1926), 321-346.

11) P. Dedecker, Les foncteuers Ext_Pi, H2_Pi and H2_Pi non abeliens,
C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 258 (1964), 4891-4895.

More recently, Schreier theory was pushed one step up the categorical
ladder by Larry Breen.  As far as I can tell, he essentially classified
the extensions of a 2-group B by a 2-group F in terms of homomorphisms
B -> AUT(F), where AUT(F) is the *3-group* of automorphisms of F:

12) Lawrence Breen, Theorie de Schreier superieure, Ann. Sci. Ecole Norm.
Sup. 25 (1992), 465-514.  Also available at
http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?id=ASENS_1992_4_25_5

We can keep pushing Schreier theory upwards like this, but we can also
expand it "sideways" by replacing groups with groupoids.  You should have
been annoyed by how I kept assuming my topological spaces were connected
and equipped with a specified point.   I did this to make them analogous
to groups.  For example, it's only spaces like this for which the
fundamental
group is sufficiently powerful to classify covering spaces.  For more
general
spaces, we should use the fundamental *groupoid* instead of the fundamental
group.  And, we can set up a Schreier theory for extensions of groupoids:

13) V. Blanco, M. Bullejos and E. Faro, Categorical non abelian cohomology,
and the Schreier theory of groupoids, available as math.CT/0410202.

In fact, these authors note that Grothendieck did something similar
back in 1971: he classified *all* groupoids fibered over a groupoid
B in terms of weak 2-functors from B to Gpd, which is the 2-groupoid of
groupoids!  The point here is that Gpd contains AUT(F) for any fixed
groupoid F:

14) Alexander Grothendieck, Categories fibrees et descente (SGA I),
Lecture Notes in Mathematics 224, Springer, Berlin, 1971.

Having extended the idea "sideways" like this, one can then continue
marching "upwards".  I don't know how much work has been done on this,
but the slogan should be something like this:

                  n-GROUPOIDS FIBERED OVER AN n-GROUPOID B
                             ARE "THE SAME" AS
            WEAK (n+1)-FUNCTORS FROM B TO THE (n+1)-GROUPOID nGpd

aha, weak or lax as much above will likely be also

Grothendieck also studied this kind of thing with categories replacing
groupoids, so there should also be an n-category version, I think...
but it's more delicate to define "fibrations" for categories than
for groupoids, so I'm a bit scared to state a slogan suitable for
n-categories.

However, I'm not scared to go from n-groupoids to omega-groupoids, which
are basically the same as spaces.  In terms of spaces, the slogan goes
like this:

                        SPACES FIBERED OVER THE SPACE B
                               ARE "THE SAME" AS
                    MAPS FROM B TO THE SPACE OF ALL SPACES

This is how James Dolan taught it to me.  Most mortals are scared of "the
space of all spaces" - both for fear of Russell's paradox, and because we
really need a *space* of all spaces, not just a mere set of them.  To avoid
these terrors, you can water down Jim's slogan by choosing a specific space
F to be the fiber:

                  FIBRATIONS WITH FIBER F OVER THE SPACE B
                             ARE "THE SAME" AS
                MAPS FROM B TO THE CLASSIFYING SPACE OF AUT(F)

where AUT(F) is the topological group of homotopy self-equivalences of F.
The fearsome "space of all spaces" is then the disjoint union of the
classifying spaces of all these topological groups AUT(F).  It's too large
to be a space unless you pass to a larger universe of sets, but otherwise
it's perfectly fine.  Grothendieck invented the notion of a "Grothendieck
universe" for precisely this purpose:

Dear All,

The 83rd Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will be held on the
weekend of 6-7 May 2006 in Glasgow, Scotland.  Further information will
be circulated closer to the time.

For those unfamiliar with PSSLs, they are a long-running series of
meetings, usually held on a weekend at a university somewhere in Europe.
They are fairly informal, e.g. people sometimes present work in
progress.  The name is a (charming) historical relic: talks cover all
aspects of category theory, not just sheaves and logic.

Tom

Let  R  be a commutative ring. {Footnote: If, instead, R  is a ring
with anti-involution (such as a group-ring) all that is below appears
to still hold.} Let  R-fpmod  be the category of finitely presented
R-modules and let  *F*  be the full category of finitely presented
covariant abelian-group-valued functors on  R-fpmod. A functor is in
*F*  iff it appears in an exact sequence  H^A --> H^B --> T --> O
where the first two objects are representable functors.

It is an easy exercise to see that  *F*  is an exact subcategory of
the ambient functor category, hence an abelian category. For any
f.p.module  A  we will use  A@  to denote the functor that carries
B  to  A@B  (using, here,  @  for $\otimes$). If we choose a
finite-rank free resolution  F --> G --> A --> O  we obtain exact
F@ --> G@ --> A@ --> O.  Since  F@ = H^F, G@ = H^G  and  *F*  is
closed under cokernel formation, we know that  A@  is in  *F*. (I'll
continue to denote isomorphisms here with equality signs.)

Let  I  denote the forgetful functor from  R-fpmod  to the category
of abelian groups. It has two other notations, to wit, H^R  and  R@.

I pointed out in my last note that  *F*  is the free abelian category
generated by  R. (That is, given any abelian category with an object
and an action of  R  thereon there is an exact functor from  *F*  that
carries  I  to the given object, unique up to natural equivalence.)
But I'm not going to use that fact here. (I did use it to learn all
this stuff, though.).

NOTATION: Every group-valued functor from a category of  R-modules,
commutative  R, can be canonically lifted to a module-valued functor.
Given two such functors, S  and  T, we follow the CS tradition of
denoting their composition, "first apply  S  then  T"  as  S;T  (hence
(S;T)(A) = T(S(A)).

For fixed  S  the functor  S;T  is exact in the second variable. (That
property, together with  S:I = S, characterizes this bifunctor; we
don't actually need to define it in terms of composition.)

We will need:

         (H^A);(H^B) = H^{A@B}
and
           (A@);(B@) = (A@B)@

DEFINE:

     [S,T]  is the functor such that sends  A  to the group of natural
     transformations  Hom((H^A;S),T)

Note:  [S,T]  carries right exact sequences in the first variable to
left exact sequences, and preserves left-exactness in the second
variable. We will need the formula

       [H^A,T] = (A@);T

verifiable by evaluating on an arbitrary  B:

   [H^A,T](B)  =  Hom((H^B;H^A),T)  =  Hom(H^{A@B},T)  =
      T(A@B)  =  ((A@);T)(B)

A  couple of things implicit in the definition of  [S,T]  should be
explicated. First:

LEMMA: If  S  and  T  are in  *F*  then so is  S;T.

BECAUSE: If  T  is in  *F*  let  H^A --> H^B --> T --> 0  be
exact. We obtain an exact sequence

              S;H^A --> S;H^B --> S;T --> O

Since  *F*  is closed under cokernel formation it suffices to show
that  S;H^A  is in  *F*  for any f.p. R-module  A. Let  F  and  G  be
finite-rank free modules and  F --> G --> A --> O  exact. Then so is

            O --> S;H^A --> S;H^G --> S;H^F

Since  *F*  is closed under kernel formation it suffices to show that
S;H^F  is in  *F*  for any finite-rank free module  F. But  S;H^F  is
just a finite direct sum of copies of  S  and  *F*  is, of course,
closed under direct sums. []

Second explication:

LEMMA: If  S  and  T  are in  *F*  then so is  [S,T].

BECAUSE: If  S  is in  *F*  let  H^A --> H^B --> S --> 0  be exact. We
obtain an exact sequence

            O --> [S,T] --> [H^B,T] --> [H^A,T]

which we know can be rewritten as

            O --> [S,T] --> (B@);T --> (A@);T

Since  *F*  is closed under kernel formation and composition we're
done. []

DEFINE a  *-FUNCTOR,  S*  as  [S,I].

LEMMA:  The duality functor is exact

BECAUSE: If  S --> T  --> U  is exact then  H^A;S --> H^A;T  --> H^A;U
is exact for every  A. We will obtain, therefore, the exactness of
U*(A) --> S*(A) --> T*(A)  if we know:

LEMMA: The object  I  is injective in  *F*.

BECAUSE: Being a representable functor, I  is, of course, projective
in the ambient functor category, hence in  *F*.

Let
                               O

                               |

                               I

                               |

               H^A --> H^B --> T --> O

be exact (all vertical arrows point down). We seek a retraction for
I --> T. Since  I  is projective we can choose a map  I --> H^B  to
yield a commutative triangle. The fact that  I --> T  is monic says
that
                              O ----> I

                              |       |

                             H^A --> H^B

is a pullback. It is, therefore, the Yoneda-image of a pushout square:

                               B --> A

                               |     |

                               R --> O

Let  O --> K --> B --> A. It is an exercise in abelian categories
that  K --> B --> R  is epi. (The dual exercise is easy in the category
of abelian groups -- which, of course,  suffices.)  We may choose a
retraction  R --> K. The map it induces,  H^B --> H^K --> I, is such
that  H^A --> H^B --> H^K --> I  is a zero-map and we obtain a
factorization  H^B --> I  =  H^B --> T --> I. The map  T --> I  is what
we seek. []

{Footnote: The object I  need not be injective in the ambient functor
category. In the case  R = Z  let  T  be the functor that assigns to a
group its torsion subgroup. If  I  were injective then any endo-
transformation on  T  would extend to an endo-transformation on  I.
But there are uncountably many endo-transformations on  T  and only
countably many on  I  (the ring of endo-transformations on  T  is the
"n-adic" completion of the integers -- it may be constructed as the
product of all the p-adic completions.)}

THEOREM: The  *-functor on is a duality on  *F*.

WE NEED TO SHOW that  S** = S. First note that  I* = I, hence, of
course, I** = I. Second, for any finite-rank free module, F,
(H^F)** = H^F, just because the *-functor is additive. Third, for any
f.p. module  A  let  F  and  G  be finite rank free modules and
F --> G --> A --> O  exact. Then  O --> H^A --> H^G --> H^F  is exact
and is carried to exact  O --> (H^A)** --> H^G --> H^F, hence
(H^A)** = H^A. Finally, for any  T  in  *F*, choose
H^A --> H^B --> T --> O  exact. The **-functor carries it to exact
H^A --> H^B --> T** --> O  Hence  T** = T. []

Note that  (H^A)* =  [H^A,I]  =  (A@);I  =  A@.  Hence  (A@)* = H^A.

SLOGAN:   H^A  and  A@  are dual.

It follows that  A@  is injective in  *F*. (It's a good exercise to
find a direct proof.) And, of course, every object has an injective
resolution (if  H^A --> H^B --> T*--> O is exact then so is
O --> T --> B@ --> A@). Note that an f.p, functor is projective iff
it is representable and, dually, it is injective iff it is of the
form  A@.

{Footnote: The category of f.p. abelian-group-valued sheaves on
R-fpmod, that is, the category of f.p. abelian-group-valued
_contravariant_ functors on  R-fpmod need not have injective
resolutions. In the case that  R = Z  any f.p. functor will carry  Z
to an f.p. abelian group. If  E  is injective in the category of f.p
functors then for any  n > 0  the map  n:Z --> Z  induces monic
H_Z --> H_Z  hence epic  (H_Z,E) --> (H_Z,E). The latter is just
multiplication by  n  on  E(Z), hence  E(Z)  is a divisible group.
But the only divisible finitely generated abelian group is  O, thus
H_Z  can not have an injective extension.}

DEFINE  S@T  =  [S,T*]*.

It follows immediately that this bi-functor on  *F*  is right-exact in
both variables and that it is a commutative with  I  as unit. Note:

        H^A @ H^B   =   H^{A@B}

(which together with the right-exactness characterizes  @).

THEOREM	 *F*  is  *-autonomous.

BECAUSE: The only thing left to prove is

           Hom(S@T,U) = Hom(S,[T,U])

Both sides of this equation carry right-exact sequences in the first
two positions to left-exact sequences in the category of abelian
groups. It therefore suffices to verify the isomorphism when  S = H^A
and  T = H^B:

     Hom(H^A @ H^B, U) = Hom(H^{A@B},U) = U(A@B)

     Hom(H^A,[H^B,U]) = Hom(H^A,[H^B,U]) = ]H^B,U](A) = U(A@B)  []

COR:   [S,T] = [T*,S*]

LEMMA: For S  and  T  in  *F*,  (S;T)* = S*;T*.

BECAUSE: Both  (S;T)*  and  S*;T* are exact in  T. Because every
object in  *F*  is obtainable using finite limits and co-limits
starting with the object  I, it therefore suffices to establish that
(S;I)* = S*;I* and that's immediate. []

COR:  (H^A)@S = [H^A,S*]* = ((A@);S*)* = H^A;S

An interesting adjointness arises:

PROPOSITION: For  S  and  T  in  *F*

       Hom( H^A;S , T )  =  Hom( S , A@;T )

BECAUSE: H^A;S =  S@H^A  and  A@;T  =  [H^A,T].  []

{Footnote: When the compositions are reversed we obtain the routine
adjointness:  Hom( S;A@ , T )  =  Hom( S , T;H^A ).}

COR:  [S,T](A) = Hom(S, A@;T)
         S*(A) = Hom(S,A@).

{Footnote: The last equation is the one I used at Ottawa to compute
S*. If all one knows is that there is a duality on  *F*  such that
(H^A)* = A@  then we may infer
S*(A)  =  Hom(H^A,S*) = Hom(S**,(H^A)*) = Hom(S,A@).}

Recall that a coherent ring is one such that all finitely generated
ideals are finitely presented. It follows that f.p. modules are
closed under finite limits (hence form an exact subcategory).

{Footnote: Clearly Noetherian implies coherent. For a quick separating
example take the group ring of the rationals (usually called
"polynomials with rational exponents"). All finitely generated ideals
are principal. The important non-Noetherian examples arise in
algebraic geometry.}

LEMMA: For f.p. modules over a coherent ring

		 Ext^n(A,-)   and  Tor_n(A,-)  are dual.

BECAUSE: Choose a free resolution

     ...--> F_{n+1} --> F_n -->....--> F_2 --> F_1 --> A --> 0

The  Ext^n(A,--)  functors are obtainable as the homology of the
sequence:

    0 --> H^A --> H^{F_1} --> H^{F_2} --> ...

The  Tor_n(A,--)  functors are obtainable as the homology of the
sequence:

     ... --> (F_2)@ --> (F_1)@ --> A@ --> O.

These complexes are dual. []

It has not escaped my notice that this *-autonomous structure suggests
a possible alternate approach to classical homological algebra. Just
one example: a "connecting homomorphism" between half-exact f.p.
functors  S  and  T  may be identified as an exact sequence of the
form  O --> S --> E --> P --> T --> O  where  E  is injective and  P
is projective and this says that the duality works well with the
notion of satellites and derived functors.

Samson Abramsky, Tom Melham, Oege de Moor and myself have recently
founded the "Centre for Metacomputation" at Oxford. We are looking for
a 4-year senior postdoc to help coordinate the activities of the
centre:

	http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/jobs/platform

Topics of interest include types for quotation or reflection,
termination analysis, compositional model checking of (higher-order)
programs, and games semantics for aspect-orientation. Applications
from readers of this list would be very welcome!

Please bring this opportunity to the attention of anyone who might
be interested; naturally I'd be delighted to discuss the particulars
on an informal basis.


Many thanks,

Dear all,

Considering the well known fact that an equivalence relation R on a
set S gives a groupoid S_R with object set S, and the quotient of S
by R is pi_0(S_R), has anyone done any work on "equivalence
relations" on categories?

Taking the skeleton of a cat is the prototypical example, but what I
had in mind was a more "relative" construction. Given a groupoid
enriched in categories, taking a sort of Pi_1 would give us a
groupoid mod "equivalent morphisms".
There is a smell of relative homotopy about, and I don't know enough
in that area.

I realise there are a couple of levels to this game, as evidenced by
Kapranov and Voevodsky in their paper on 2-cats and the Zamolodchikov
tetrahedron equations - do we take a "skeleton" at one or more
dimensions?

Any pointers appreciated

Dear Friends and Colleagues

A few addenda to the Schreier theory discussion etc. which you might find
interesting. (I am reacting to a message I received via J. Stasheff.)

1) As pointed out by R. Brwon, an approach to non-abelian cohomology
may be phrased in terms of crossed modules.
There is a notion more general than crossed modules, that of
"crossed pair" which I introduced in the paper

Group extensions, crossed pairs, and an eight term exact sequence,
J. reine angew. Math. 321 (1981), 150--172.

Crossed pairs may be used, for example, to explore group extensions, in
particular, to examine differentials in the spectral sequence of a group extension.
I worked this out in the paper

Automorphisms of group extensions and differentials in the
Lyndon--Hochschild--Serre spectral sequence,
J. of  Algebra 72 (1981), 296--334.

I discovered later that the idea of crossed pair was in the literature
before, under the name "pseudo module" in the 50's.


Crossed pairs arise under other circumstances as well,
for example in the Galois theory of Azumaya algebras.
I have known this all my scientific life but never found the time to write
it up properly.


2) I have worked out a rigorous approach to lattice gauge theory
in the paper

Extended moduli spaces, the Kan construction, and lattice gauge theory
Topology 38 (1999), 555--596.

In this paper, I discretize a space of based gauge equivalence classes of
connections in terms of a combinatorial structure, and the resulting
object is a COSIMPLICIAL space. The geometric realization of this space
is G-equivariantly weakly homotopy equivalent to the space of based gauge
equivalence classes of connections, where G refers to the structure group
of the corresponding principal bundle.

On such a space, for example, path integrals are well defined.
As an illustration I worked out a calculation of the Chern-Simons
invariant for lens spaces. The calculation involves identities among
relations, a notion which arises in the structure theory of crossed
modules.


Best regards

Johannes

<pre>Dear Friends and Colleagues

A few addenda to the Schreier theory discussion etc. which you might find
interesting. (I am reacting to a message I received via J. Stasheff.)

1) As pointed out by R. Brwon, an approach to non-abelian cohomology
may be phrased in terms of crossed modules.
There is a notion more general than crossed modules, that of
"crossed pair" which I introduced in the paper

Group extensions, crossed pairs, and an eight term exact sequence,
J. reine angew. Math. 321 (1981), 150--172.

Crossed pairs may be used, for example, to explore group extensions, in
particular, to examine differentials in the spectral sequence of a group extension.
I worked this out in the paper

Automorphisms of group extensions and differentials in the
Lyndon--Hochschild--Serre spectral sequence,
J. of  Algebra 72 (1981), 296--334.

I discovered later that the idea of crossed pair was in the literature
before, under the name "pseudo module" in the 50's.


Crossed pairs arise under other circumstances as well,
for example in the Galois theory of Azumaya algebras.
I have known this all my scientific life but never found the time to write
it up properly.


2) I have worked out a rigorous approach to lattice gauge theory
in the paper

Extended moduli spaces, the Kan construction, and lattice gauge theory
Topology 38 (1999), 555--596.

In this paper, I discretize a space of based gauge equivalence classes of
connections in terms of a combinatorial structure, and the resulting
object is a COSIMPLICIAL space. The geometric realization of this space
is G-equivariantly weakly homotopy equivalent to the space of based gauge
equivalence classes of connections, where G refers to the structure group
of the corresponding principal bundle.

On such a space, for example, path integrals are well defined.
As an illustration I worked out a calculation of the Chern-Simons
invariant for lens spaces. The calculation involves identities among
relations, a notion which arises in the structure theory of crossed
modules.

Is there an accepted terminology for semigroups with many objects, i.e.
gadgets that satisfy the all the axioms satisfied by categories excepting those
which refer to identities ?

Has anybody worked out a theory of internal anafunctors?


On the one hand, there is a notion of internal category,
that is a category internal to some other category,
such as (were these the first?) Ehresmann's differential categories.
There are also (I assume that Ehresmann discussed these too)
internal functors between these internal categories.
In particular, one component of an internal functor from X to Y
is a morphism from the object of objects of X to the object of objects of Y,
just as one component of an ordinary functor from C to D
is a function from the set of objects of C to the set of objects of D.

On the other hand, Marco Makkai has argued that,
if you don't believe in the axiom of choice
(either because you disbelieve or wish to be agnostic),
then you should use anafunctors (possibly always saturated)
instead of functors in general category theory.
In particular, an anafunctor from C to D does *not* necessarily include
a function from the set of objects of C to the set of objects of D
(although such a function does follow from the axiom of choice).

Now, even if you believe in the axiom of choice,
still there are many topoi in which choice does not hold.
Yet Makkai's theory of anafunctors (being constructive)
can be expressed in the internal language of a topos,
so there is automatically a theory of internal anfunctor
between internal categories in an arbitrary topos.
(Arguably, this should be regarded as the right way
to internalise category theory into a topos,
or more generally to treat models of constructive category theory.)

My question, then, is whether anybody has worked this out
in arbitrary categories, or at least more generally than in topoi
(for example, in an arbitrary site).  In particular, has anybody worked out
differentiable anafunctors between differentiable categories
(internal to the category of differentiable spaces)?


I am pretty sure that I know how to do this,
and it will be used in my PhD dissertation.
But I would prefer to give the proper credit,
and even replace as many proofs as possible
with citations to others' papers! ^_^

Here are a couple of pointers for double groupoids
(strict, but with arbitrary side structures) :

1.
Given a double groupoid S, say over groupoids H and V
with common base M, the set of orbits for S over V is a
groupoid over the set of orbits for H over M. This
is set out in \3 of

@ARTICLE{,
    author = {K.~C.~H. Mackenzie},
    title = {Double {L}ie algebroids and second-order geometry, {I}},
    journal = {Adv. Math.},
    volume = 94,
    number = 2,
    pages = {180--239},
    year = 1992,
}

It gives an elegant way of passing from an affinoid to the
corresponding `butterfly diagram' or `Morita equivalence'.

2.
General quotients for a groupoid G can be formulated in terms
of congruences, which in turn are sub double groupoids of
the double groupoid structure on G\times G. This (done with
Philip Higgins) is in \S2.4 of

@book {MR2157566,
     AUTHOR = {Mackenzie, Kirill C. H.},

Subject: categories: Equivalence relations

Dear all,

Considering the well known fact that an equivalence relation R on a
set S gives a groupoid S_R with object set S, and the quotient of S
by R is pi_0(S_R), has anyone done any work on "equivalence
relations" on categories?

Taking the skeleton of a cat is the prototypical example, but what I
had in mind was a more "relative" construction. Given a groupoid
enriched in categories, taking a sort of Pi_1 would give us a
groupoid mod "equivalent morphisms".
There is a smell of relative homotopy about, and I don't know enough
in that area.

I realise there are a couple of levels to this game, as evidenced by
Kapranov and Voevodsky in their paper on 2-cats and the Zamolodchikov
tetrahedron equations - do we take a "skeleton" at one or more
dimensions?

Any pointers appreciated

I think that Isar Stubbe 's thesis treated
those gadgets and he called them "semi-categories".

Koslowski calls these "taxonomies", see e.g. "Monads and interpolads in
bicategories" (TAC vol 3, no 8 (1997)).

Do you  have any examples of such things?  I'd be interested to  know.

Paul





The principal examples I know are all related to the  category of Moore paths
in a topological space X . It turns out to be  convenient not to have any
degenerate paths when making certain constructions,  especially when working with
the higher dimensional versions of these  gadgets. This can be arranged as
follows.

Consider the set of non-identity paths of the Moore category. Define the
domain (respectively, the codomain) of a path f to be  the path of UNIT length
that is constantly f ( 0 ) (resp., constantly  f ( 1 ) ).  Two paths f , g, can
be composed if  codomain g = domain  f and the composite is then the
concatenation ( f followed by g ).  This is a semigroup with many objects, i.e. a
directed graph with an associative  composition law. The multiplication is stricly
associative but there are no  identities or even any idempotents.

I don't like the term "semigroupoids" because it evokes (for me) the notion
of invertibility which I want to avoid.

I know Anders Kock has suggested "fair categories" to describe  category-like
objects in which there are identities unique only "up to  homotopy", but
semigroups with many objects don't have any identities at  all.

The term "near category" occurred to me but I seem to recall this being  used
to describe something else and I can't put my finger on that  reference.

Of course, when the day comes that "higher dimensional algebra" is just
"algebra" maybe semigroups with many objects will just be called semigroups (  and
semigroups with one object called a proper semigroups ?), groupoids  will be
called groups (and groups with one object called proper groups  ?) and
categories will be called monoids (and monoids with one object called  proper
monoids?).

actually set out to demonstrate that non-abelian cohomology
is _not_ needed for the classification.

The standard classification of principal bundles P(M,G) with
M, G given is by nonabelian H^1. My point was that it is at
least equally interesting to classify possible P(M,G) with
not just G prescribed, but the bundle of Lie groups associated
to P through the inner automorphism action. This is variously
called the gauge group bundle or (I think misleadingly) the
adjoint group bundle.

Given M and a bundle of Lie groups B on M, there is an
obstruction class to the existence of a principal bundle
P(M,G) with gauge group bundle B. If such a P exists then
all possible such P are classified in the usual way by abelian
cohomology.

This approach extends in principle to general extensions of
principal bundles.

This approach arose because in the corresponding problem on
the infinitesimal level, it is certainly more natural to
classify transitive Lie algebroids with prescribed adjoint
bundle. (The adjoint bundle of a transitive Lie algebroid is
the kernel of the anchor map. For the Atiyah sequence of a
principal bundle it is the bundle associated to P through the
adjoint representation.)

In addition to I.Stubbe's, there are works by Schroeder, Herrlich-=20
Schroeder and Borceux et al.

Further examples of (topologically enriched) semicategories  are =20
ghizmos called =A8Flows=A8, promoted by Ph.Gaucher (this author crafts =20=

everything from scratch, without any mention of semicategories and =20
enrichment).

Google's not a perfect metric for popularity, but it returns about 350
hits for "semigroupoid", about 10 for "fair category", and none for
"near category" (the one hit it returns is spurious). Wikipedia has an
entry for "semigroupoid" (with the definition you're thinking of) and
nothing on any of the others. Looking at MathSciNet, we find 180 hits
for "semigroupoid", none for "fair category", and one for "near
category". It's worse than that, though, because that paper uses "near
category" to mean something different, namely a category-like object
with identities but without associativity!

All this suggests to me that "semigroupoid" is the standard term, and
certainly it's the only one I've ever heard before. I don't think you
need to worry about implied invertibility: if you know what both a
groupoid and a semigroup are, the term "semigroupoid" strongly suggests
a multi-object structure with associatively-composable arrows, but not
necessarily with identities. At least, it suggests that to me :-)

Hope that helps,

Miles

I wrote in small part:

Several people have pointed out to me that I mean
Michael Makkai here (not to be confused with Marco Mackaay).
^^^^^^^

Since Makkai may read this list (at least, he's posted in the past),
I hope he's not offended!  I apologise.

Well, not quite.  In a taxonomy the identity axiom is not simply
removed, but replaced by a weaker requirement.  Essentially this
says that every morphism factors.  In the corresponding semigroups,
which I would call "interpolative", this can also be formulated as
follows: the multiplication  * : S x S ---> S  is a coequalizer of
S x *  and   * x S .  (This formulation can be lifted to taxonomies
as well.)  It would be interesting to know, whether the gadget that
prompted this question is a taxonomy in this sense.

[By the way, the term "taxonomy" resulted from a misunderstanding
on my part of a remark by Robert Pare and Richard Wood.  It has
since been abbreviated to "taxon".]

The notion of "category without units" also shows up in Azumaya=3D20
theory as studied by Francis Borceux and others.

In my comment on Miles' post which surveyed current terminology I  said:

"The algebra closure in the weak operator topology then defines the
"semigroupoid" C star algbera. Of course this algebra does contain one  idempotent for
each object, but this is a consequence of taking the algebra-  closure of the
set of patial isometries defined by the arrows. "

The last sentence is incorrect. I have to stop associating "... oid" with
invertibility.

	       International Category Theory Conference
			       CT 2006

			June 25 - July 1, 2006
		       White Point, Nova Scotia

	     http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/ct2006/

				* * *

 The International Category Theory Conference (CT) covers all areas of
 pure and applied category theory. Topics of interest include, but are
 not limited to: higher dimensional categories, categorical logic,
 applications of categories in algebra, topology, combinatorics, and
 other areas of mathematics, applications of category theory to
 computer science, physics and other mathematical sciences. Previous
 meetings in this series were held in Vancouver (2004), Como (2000),
 Coimbra (1999), Vancouver (1997), Halifax (1995), Tours (1994), Isle
 of Thorns (1992), Montreal (1991), and Como (1990).

 CT 2006 will be an active research-oriented conference, in something
 of an "Oberwolfach style". The seaside setting will offer more
 opportunities for informal discussion and collaboration in the
 evenings than might be the case in an urban setting. There will also
 be many opportunities for recreational activities.

 All those interested in category theory and its applications are
 welcome.

LOCATION:

 The CT 2006 conference will be held at the White Point Beach Resort
 (http://www.whitepoint.com/). White Point is a seaside resort in Nova
 Scotia (Canada), about 100 minutes' drive from Halifax.

 The conference venue offers a choice of accommodation, both in
 comfortable finished cabins and in "hotel-style" rooms. All meals are
 included in the price of the rooms. (There will be a moderate
 registration fee to cover other conference costs.)

 For more details on accommodations and reservations, as well as
 details of how to get there, please see the conference web page.

TO GIVE A TALK:

 Prospective speakers should submit an abstract of up to one page.
 Abstracts should be sufficiently detailed to allow the scientific
 committee to assess the merits of the work.  Submissions should be in
 plain text, Postscript, or PDF format, and must be sent to
 ct06@mathstat.dal.ca by February 27. Receipt of all submissions will
 be acknowledged by return email. Authors will be notified by March 30
 of the acceptance of their talks.

BOOKING YOUR ROOM

 We would like to stress that, due to the secluded rural location of
 the conference, there are no convenient alternative accommodations.
 White Point Beach Resort has reserved a large block of rooms and
 cottages for us, but cannot hold them indefinitely; if numbers are
 below expectation by late January, they may have to reduce the number
 of rooms reserved. While all the rooms at White Point are very nice,
 there are various different styles; booking early will assure you the
 best choice of accommodation. (Should unforeseen circumstances make
 it impossible for you to attend, you can cancel for a $5 processing
 fee.)

IMPORTANT DEADLINES:

 Feb 27, 2006: submission of abstracts
 Mar 1, 2006: early registration
 Mar 30, 2006: notification of authors
 Apr 20, 2006: registration

  Mike Barr has pointed out that the proof in my last posting of

LEMMA: The object  I = H^R  is injective in  *F*.

  doesn't work. (It was actually the fourth proof I had come up with.
  I wondered why it was so much simpler). So here's one that does work
  (and is just about as simple).

Let
                                      O

                                      |

                                     H^R

                                      |

                      H^A --> H^B --> T --> O

be exact (all vertical arrows point down). We seek a retraction for
H^R --> T. Since  H^R  is projective (as is any representable) we may
choose a map  H^R --> H^B  to yield a commutative triangle. The full
subcategory of representables is closed under finite limits, so let

                             H^C --> H^R

                              |       |

                             H^A --> H^B

be a pullback in  *F* and let

                               B --> A

                               |     |

                               R --> C

be the corresponding pushout in the category of f.p  R-modules. The
map from  H^C  to  T  is the zero map and we use the hypothesis that
H^R --> T  is monic to infer that  H^C --> H^R, hence  R --> C, are
zero maps. Let  O --> K --> B --> A  be exact. It is an exercise in
abelian categories that  R --> C  =  0  implies  K --> B --> R  is
epi. Now (finally using the projectivity of  R) choose a retraction
R --> K. The map  H^A --> H^B --> H^K --> H^R  is of course, a zero
map and we may factor  H^B --> H^K --> H^R  as  H^B --> T --> H^R.
The map   T --> H^R  is easily checked to be the retraction we seek.

Well, it does seem that "semigroupoids" is the preferred terminology.
Searching on this term through the math xxx archive pulls up a number of papers
which study various kinds of C star algebras built on top of  semigroupoids.
The idea is to use the objects of the semigroupoid to index  a basis in a
(separable) Hilbert space and to use the arrows to define partial  isometries of
this Hilbert space in the obvious way. The algebra closure in the  weak operator
topology then defines the "semigroupoid" C star algbera. Of course  this
algebra does contain one idempotent for each object, but this is a  consequence of
taking the algebra- closure of the set of patial isometries  defined by the
arrows.

Perhaps 'semi-category' is the most widely used term.=20

The word 'taxonomy' has also been used (Par=E9, Wood, Ageron), but
Koslowski has used that word for something a bit more complicated
('interpolads in SPAN').

On the other hand, Schroeder has used the word 'semi-category'
for the 'multiplicative graphs' of Ehresmann (some structure where
composition of arrows is not always defined even if their source
and target match).  (Curiously, in a preliminary version of the paper
by Moens, Berni-Canani, and Borceux, 'On regular presheaves and
regular semi-categories', the term 'multiplicative graph' was used
for 'semi-category' -- the final version uses 'semi-category'.)


I would also like to advogate 'semi-monoid' instead of 'semi-group',
and 'semi-monoidal category' for 'monoidal category without unit'.
It seems to be too late at this point to convince operadists to say
'semi-operad' for operads without unit.

In the same spirit I find it convenient to use 'semi-simplicial set'
for presheaves on Delta-mono, but I am told that this is confusing,
since apparently 'semi-simplicial set' meant something else fifty
years ago...

Cheers,
Joachim.

Dear all,

I call a "small semigroup with many objects enriched over the model categ=
ory=20
of compactly generated topological spaces" a "flow" in my work (these obj=
ects=20
are interesting for me only if they are enriched over very particular mod=
el=20
categories satisfying particular properties). The terminology comes from =
the=20
fact that I use them to study the time flow of a higher dimensional autom=
aton=20
(up to directed homotopy).=20

For "taxonomy", I would be very curious to know the origin of the termino=
logy.=20
What does it mean exactly ?

In the paper q-alg/9608025 "Flexible sheaves", Carlos Simpson calls a "(n=
ot=20
necessarily small) semigroup with many objects enriched over the category=
 of=20
topological spaces" a continuous semicategory.=20

I had also seen the word "precategory" but I cannot remember where. Bewar=
e of=20
the fact that the word precategory is also used for categories *with=20
identities* such that the composition law is partially defined : that is =
the=20
fact that the codomain of F is equal to the domain of G is not sufficient=
 for=20
GoF to exist. Once again, I cannot remember where I read this word. The o=
nly=20
thing I remember is that that was a computer-scientific work.

The word "non-unital category" is also used sometime in mathematical pape=
rs.=20

Jacobson coined "rng" for a ring without identity and Bill returned
the favor by proposing "rig" for a ring without negation (at least
Bill's proposal can be pronounced). Alas, "catgory" is the only
approximation for the instant case -- the only one, that is, if you
refuse to count "ctegory" (category without automorphisms).

Seriously though, "semi-category" is the one proposal not needing
explanation. May I suggest that its very obviousness is why it was
avoided.

Actually it is an RA (Relation Algebra) tradition dating back to the
19th century.  In my LICS'92 evening history talk, "Origins of the
Calculus of Binary Relations", http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/ocbr.pdf, I
attributed it as follows.

I still don't know whether RA played any role in the adoption of ; by
Algol 60.  However Algol 60 used ; not as a statement terminator (as in
C or Java) but as an associative infix operator between statements,
suggestive of RA influence.  (Perhaps so as not to overly inconvenience
those who tended to think of semicolon as a terminator anyway, the empty
string was permitted as a statement, inadvertently complicating the task
of generating the language Algol 60 with an unambiguous context-free
grammar.)

Dear All,

One told me very recently that Joyal is writting a book about=20
"quasi-categories". But with a different meaning. A quasi-category is a=20
simplicial set satisfying a condition a little bit weaker than the Kan=20
condition. Morally speaking, two composable arrows have several possible=20
compositions, up to homotopy. I dont know whether Joyal reads this=20
mailing-list ?=20

Dear Categorists -

Here's a new paper:

  http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/higher.pdf
  http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/higher.ps

  John Baez and Urs Schreiber
  Higher Gauge Theory

  Just as gauge theory describes the parallel transport of point
  particles using connections on bundles, higher gauge theory
  describes the parallel transport of 1-dimensional objects (e.g.
  strings) using 2-connections on 2-bundles.  A 2-bundle is a
  categorified version of a bundle: that is, one where the fiber
  is not a manifold but a category with a suitable smooth structure.
  Where gauge theory uses Lie groups and Lie algebras, higher gauge
  theory uses their categorified analogues: Lie 2-groups and Lie
  2-algebras.  We describe a theory of 2-connections on principal
  2-bundles and explain how this is related to Breen and Messing's
  theory of connections on nonabelian gerbes.  The distinctive
  feature of our theory is that a 2-connection allows parallel
  transport along paths and surfaces in a parametrization-independent
  way.  In terms of Breen and Messing's framework, this requires
  that the `fake curvature' must vanish.  In this paper we summarize
  the main results of our theory without proofs.

Fans of Lie groupoids may enjoy the "smooth 2-groupoid" used in this
paper.

Best,
jb

There has been a long discussion on the list=20
about "categories without identities", whatever=20
you decide to call them. And the attention has=20
been brought to axioms which could -- in this=20
more general context -- replace the identity=20
axiom.

I would like to focus on a very striking categorical aspect of this problem.

A (right) module M on a ring R with unit must satisfy the axiom m1=3Dm
=2E.. but what about the case when R does not have a unit ?

Simply dropping the axiom m1=3Dm leaves you with=20
the unpleasant situation where you have two=20
different notions of module, in the case where R=20
has a unit.

Therefore people working in linear algebra have considered the axiom

      the scalar multiplication M@R ---> M is an isomorphism
      (@=3Dtensor product sign)

which is equivalent to the axiom m1=3Dm, when the=20
ring has a unit ... but makes perfect sense when=20
the ring does not have a unit. Such modules are=20
generally called "Taylor regular".

A ring R with unit is simply a one-objet additive=20
category and a right module M on R is simply an=20
additive presheaf M ---> Ab (=3Dthe category of=20
abelian groups).

A ring without unit is thus a "one-object=20
additive category without identity", again=20
whatever you decide to call this.

But what is the analogue of the axiom

      M@R ---> M is an isomorphism

when R is now an arbitrary small (enriched)=20
"category without identities" and M is an=20
arbitrary (enriched) presheaf on it ?

All of us know that to define a (co)limit, we do=20
not need at all to start with an indexing=20
category: an arbitrary graph with arbitrary=20
commutativity conditions works perfectly well. In=20
particular, a "category without identities" is=20
all right. And the same holds in the enriched=20
case, with (co)limits replaced by "weighted=20
(co)limits".

Now every presheaf on a small category is=20
canonically a colimit of representable ones ...=20
but this result depends heavily on the existence=20
of identities ! When you work with a presheaf M=20
on a "category R without identities", you still=20
have a canonical morphism

      canonical colimit of representables ---> R

and you can call M "Taylor regular" when this is=20
an isomorphism. Again in the enriched case,=20
"colimit" means "weighted colimit". This=20
recaptures exactly the case of "Taylor regular=20
modules", when working with Ab-enriched=20
categories.

A sensible axiom to put on a "category R without=20
identities" is the fact that the representable=20
functors are "Taylor regular". (We should=20
certainly call this something else than "Taylor=20
regular", but let me keep this terminology in=20
this message.)

And when R is a "Taylor regular category without identities", the constructi=
on

      presheaf on R |---> corresponding canonical colimit of representables

yields a reflection for the inclusion of Taylor=20
regular presheaves in all presheaves.

A very striking property is the existence of a=20
further (necessarily full and faithful) left=20
adjoint to this reflection. This second inclusion=20
provides in fact an equivalence with the full=20
subcategory of those presheaves which satisfy the=20
Yoneda isomorphism.

This yields thus a nice example of what Bill=20
Lawvere calls the "unity of opposites": the two=20
inclusions identify the category of Taylor=20
regular presheaves with
* on one side, those presheaves which are colimits of representables;
* on the other side, those presheaves which satisfy the Yoneda lemma.
This underlines the pertinence of these "Taylor=20
regular categories without identities".

To my knowledge, the best treatment of these=20
questions is to be found in various papers by=20
Marie-Anne Moens and by Isar Stubbe, in=20
particular in the "Cahiers" and in "TAC".

And very interesting examples occur in functional=20
analysis (the identity on a Hilbert space is a=20
compact operator ... if and only if the space is=20
finite dimensional) and also in the theory of=20
quantales.

  While checking Jacobson's responsibility for "rng" Google directed
  me to www.math.binghamton.edu/alex/Yale_Math_Skit.html where we
  learn a most appropriate pronunciation for the word. And it reminds
  those of us old enough just what we used to be up against.

Script of skit performed at the Yale Math Department Christmas Party
in 1974 by the second year graduate students:

Chico Miraglia, Craig Huneke, Paul Blanchard, Bob Bix, Richard Foote,
Alex Feingold, Monica Baratieri, Dan Coro, John Elton (Piano!), John
M(?).

                          Jacobson Interview

Johnny: Now, please welcome our next guest, the current President of
Categories Anonymous, Mr. Nathan Jacobson. (He enters) Mr. Jacobson,
just what does Categories Anonymous do?

Jacobson: Johnny, our organization was founded to lead the fight
against Categories. This dreaded disease can strike any mathematician,
regardless of age, sex, sponsoring institution, or expected area of
concentration. Categories is now the Number One Killer of Mathematics.
Johnny, did you know that Categories has destroyed more mathematics
than co- and homology combined?

Johnny: No.

Jacobson: Did you know that algebraic geometry used to make some
sense?

Johnny: I didn't know that.

Jacobson: Now all our rings have units. Where did we go rng? I'm
sorry, Johnny, but when something this terrible strikes so close to
home --

Johnny: I understand. But tell me, is there a cure for categories?

Jacobson: Not yet. But if diagnosed early enough, categories can be
controlled; the patient is forced to factor integers into primes and
multiply matrices out until his insanity passes.

Johnny: Can a person examine himself for categories? (Ed McMath looks
himself over)

Jacobson: I'm glad you asked me that. Remember that categories can
strike anyone, any time, any place. So learn the Early Warning Signs
for Categories:
  1. Have you stopped caring whether you understand what you're doing?
  2. Do you like your theorems general but vacuous?
  3. Do you consider yourself a social arrow-chaser?
  4. Do you think of everything as a universal object?

In order to provide a categorical semantics of typed $\lambda$-calculus
without $\eta$-rule Susumu Hayashi used semicategories in

MR0841025 (87i:18005) Hayashi, Susumu
Adjunction of semifunctors: categorical structures
in nonextensional lambda calculus.
Theoret. Comput. Sci. 41 (1985), no. 1, 95--104.

This was later taken up by R.Hoofman in his Thesis on "Nonstable Models
of Linear Logic" (see the first 7 items when you type in "Hoofman, R*"
in Math.Reviews).

However, in my opinion for the purpose of modelling $\lambda\beta$-calculus
it is more natural to use the following kind of structures: (small) categories
\C with finite products such that y(Y)^{y(X)} (taken in Psh(\C)) is a retract
of some y(E).

That would have been my paper with Paulo Mateus "Universal aspects of
probabilistic automata" in MSCS (and also "Monads on composition graphs"
in APCS). We do indeed use the word "precategory" for strucures with
identities, and with a partially defined composition law satisfying the
identity laws (strongly) and the associative law in the sense that
f(gh)=(fg)h holds strongly (or Kleene) provided that both gh and fg are
defined.

Moreover, as pointed out in a previous message, I have used the word
"semicategory" for similar structures, but with a stronger associative
law, requiring that f(gh)=(fg)h are both defined whenever fg and gh are
defined (or slight variations of this). Ehresmann used the term
"multiplicative graph" (and also sometimes "neocategory", I believe) for
structures satisfying the identity law, with no associativity imposed at
all.

Perhaps it has not been sufficiently emphasized that semi-categories and
the like are not really "generalizations" of categories (though formally
they may appear so). Actually they present possibly-useful SPECIAL classes
of categories. That is because we represent one ultimately in an actual
large category (such as sets or abelian groups) and those representations
are indeed representations of a certain ordinary (V-) category, namely the
one freely generated by the given semicategory. The forgetful 2-functor
has a left adjoint, just as does the one from categories to directed
graphs etc. To be a value of such a left adjoint means that the large
category of representations may have special properties, for example it
may unite by a bicontinuous quotient p a pair of subcategories i, j whose
domains are identical but where i, j are themselves opposite in that they
are the respective adjoints to the same p. This is the kind of UIAO that
Francis refers to.

Is there a convincing example showing that it can be useful mathematically
to treat operator ideals (such as compact, nuclear, etc) as
semicategories?

I always believed that Jacobson invented rngs because algebraic practice
(not the dreaded categorists) had convinced him to grudgingly conclude
that after all ideals in rings are ideals but not subrings, whereas the
opposite view is not a convenience but a confusion which denies ideals
their dignity.

Is there a standard name for a square
A ----> B
|       |
|       |
|       |
v       v
C ----> D
in which the canonical map A ---> B x_D C is epic?  I had always called it
a weak pullback, but Peter Freyd claims that that phrase is reserved for
the case that it satisfies the existence, but not necessarily the
uniqueness of the definition of pullback.  In fact, he claims it means
that Hom(E,-) converts it to the kind of square I am talking about.
What is interesting is that in an abelian category, it satisfies
this condition iff it satisfies the dual condition iff the evident
sequence A ---> B x C ---> D is exact.  Putting a zero at the left end
characterizes a genuine pullback and at the other end a pushout.
