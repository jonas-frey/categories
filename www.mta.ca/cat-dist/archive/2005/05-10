I am interested in any stories about the 1969 Summer Institute at
Bowdoin.  Who was there?

In particular,the Reports of the Midwest Category Seminar IV (SLN 137)
has a humor piece written as a ``final exam'' for the Institute.  It is
signed ``Phreilambud.''  Who is this?  I can make it up out of various
people's names, but I don't know who was there.

``Phreilambud'' was written by me, a young student named Lambert who
disappeared, I think, from mathematics and David Eisenbud, now paying
for his sins as head of MSRI (Berkeley).

This is from memory so there could be some inaccuracies.

I first met John Isbell there since I shared office space with him. He
said that he saw no need to get a room since he could just sleep in the
office.

Peter Freyd's daughters babysat my daughter Eleanor, aged 2, and son
Lauchlin, aged 2 months and my first wife Dorinne often spoke with Pam.

Phreilambud included David Eisenbud for sure, and possibly Eilenberg,
Freyd and others.

Yes, I like this symmetric presentation.
____

As to "Notice..." (where you mean ... meet im(d),  of course), I
would add the following.

The condition  dd = 0  is linked with aspects whose relevance is
often ignored.
Without it, many systems of use in homological algebra would loose
any reasonable notion of "canonical isomorphism", and one should be
extremely prudent in working with induced morphisms and Noether
isomorphisms.

Let us start (in Ab, or any abelian category) with a sublattice  L
of subobjects of a given object (necessarily modular) and consider
the subquotients having numerator and denominator in L. Then, the
canonical isomorphisms among these subquotients (induced by the
identity) are closed under composition *if and only if* L is
distributive.

- Within this restriction, being "canonically isomorphic
subquotients" has a precise meaning: there is a well-determined
canonical isomorphism linking them.

- Without this restriction, composing canonical isomorphisms can
yield different isomorphisms between two given subquotients. Working
up to canonical isomorphism, as commonly done in homological algebra,
could easily lead to errors.

(For instance, it is easy to construct such a situation for
subquotiens of  Z^2 (pairs of integers) in Ab - the classical example
of an object whose lattice of subobjects is not distributive.)

Concretely, the main systems of homological algebra giving rise to
spectral sequences (filtered differential object, filtered complex,
exact pairs, double complex) DO produce distributive lattices.
Essentially, the proof is generally based on a crucial Birkoff
theorem: the free modular lattice generated by two chains is
distributive. But all this is no longer true without assuming  dd =
0  (or something similar) in such systems: distributivity would fail.

[[   It is easy to see the role of  dd = 0  in the simplest case, the
filtered differential object.

We have a differential object  (A, d)  equipped with a consistent
filtration  (F_p A),  so that every  d(F_p A)  is contained in  F_p
A.  Then, one can prove that the sublattice of  Sub(A)  generated by
the filtration and closed under d-images and d-preimages  (written
d*)  is generated by two filtrations, the original one and

       0  -> ... d(F_p A) ...  ->   dA  ->  d*0  ->  ...   d*(F_p
A)  ...  ->  A,

using the inclusion  dA -> d*0.    ]]

Zeeman was probably the first to recognise the importance of this fact:

     E.C. Zeeman, On the filtered differential group, Ann. Math. 66
(1957), 557-585.

_____

The theory I am referring to can be seen in three papers of mine:

M.G., On distributive homological algebra, I-III, Cahiers 25 (1984),
259-301; 25 (1984), 353-379; 26 (1985), 169-213.

Recently, Francis Borceux and I have extended part of these results
to a larger setting, including Grp (groups):

F. Borceux - M. Grandis, Jordan-Holder, modularity and distributivity
in non-commutative algebra, Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 474 (Feb
2003).

This is a triviality, but it gives a symmetric definition of homology.
Notice that it defines something even when d.d is not 0.  I guess it

I attended the Bowdoin Summer Seminar as a 2nd year math grad student with
some training in math logic and none in category theory. MacLane gave the
principal lectures (later developed into his CWM) and others (Eilenberg,
Isbell) weighed in with lectures on special topics.  A few points stick in
memory. For instance, Eilenberg lectured on his categorical treatment of
abstract machine theory. At one point he was analyzing the words generated
by a set of symbols A, and he derived that I+A+A^2+... = [I-A]^-1 with such
flourish that a spontaneous applause broke out in the audience. Otherwise,
Eilenberg along with Lawvere and Tierney played poker and smoked cigars with
great relish. In one lecture on some of Linton's results, MacLane presented
a picture of an Australian road sign for the town of "Colinton" which
MacLane said was named after Linton's antipodal dual. Foreign (i.e.,
non-North-American) category theorists were represented by (at least)
Eduardo Dubuc and Sabah Fakir. I don't know about "Phreilambud" but I
suspect the "bud" is from Eisenbud who mentions in his Preface to MacLane's
mathematical autobiography that Bowdoin was the only time he saw "Saunders
and Sammy" together and that all gathered around when they discussed the
origins of the subject one evening after dinner.

These were early days in the so-called 'foundations' debate with set theory
where the latter was represented at Bowdoin by Feferman. I suspect that many
of the arguments expressed in Feferman's 1977 article (which Colin recently
described as "the most sustained critique of categorical foundations to
date" [Phil. Math. 2005]) were hammered out at Bowdoin.

The last session of the seminar was called the "prayer meeting" where
various people were asked to "let their hair down" and talk informally about
the future of CT and foundations. I was the symbolic grad student asked to
say a few words and I was so nervous I don't remember what the others said!
I made a few (certainly elementary and perhaps incoherent) remarks on the
difference between sets as (non-self-participating) universals for a
property in contrast with the (self-participating) universals (UMPs) of CT
which in some sense exemplify the property they represent (ideas developed
years later in an article on "concrete universals" and CT in Erkenntnis
1988).

The final social event was a feast of Maine lobsters at a nearby beach
presided over by MacLane and Dorothy. As we were devouring our lobsters, I
particularly remember MacLane shouting out to all assembled: "Don't eat the
green stuff, don't eat the green stuff!" (a reference to lower part of the
lobster's alimentary canal).

	The "green stuff" is not the lower part of the lobster's alimentary
canal (a barely visible black "string"); it is the lobster's liver.
While the texture & flavor take more getting used to than those of the
white meat, the liver (known   slightly confusingly as "tomalley") is
perfectly wholesome, and should certainly be eaten. So, of course,
should the immature eggs (bright red & known as "coral") if present.

Presumably I was considered North American at the time as the Bowdoin
Seminar came between a postdoc at U Illinois (Champ-Urb) and a assistant
professorship at Tulane. Sammy commented that I began the summer as an
Australian and ended up an all American boy. Sammy was prone to
exaggeration.

I have wonderful memories of that summer:

     Mac  Lane's incredible lectures (every morning -- 2 hours I
     think -- for the whole summer),
     freezing water at the beach although the weather was hot,
     the "pro-seminars" run by new postdocs that were organized after
     Mac Lane's first lecture,
     becoming marooned when the tide came in and Eduardo Dubuc (up to
     his chest in water) carried Joan Machez (sp?) while I supported her
     broken leg in its cast,
     the tall dormitory with 16 bedrooms per level and Sammy at the
     top in the penthouse,
     that clam and lobster bake,

Recently, I advertised a postdoc position on the EPSRC-funded project
"Coalgebras, Modal Logic, Stone Duality".

Additionally, there is now a departmentally funded PhD studentship
(GTA) available. The GTA scheme involves some teaching and runs for 4
years. Unfortunately, the position is probably only of interest to
students with an EU nationality: the university seems to be unwilling to
waive the fees for non-EU nationals.

The topic of the PhD will be in the area of "Coalgebras, Modal Logic,
Stone Duality". Repeating from my previous mail:

>From the point of view of computer science, the project is about
logics for transition systems (coalgbras). From the mathematical point
of view, the project will explore the dualities arising from extending
basic, Stone-type dualities via an algebra-coalgebra duality. This
draws on results and concepts from modal logic, domain theory,
universal algebra and category theory. A background in one (or more)
of the above areas is desirable.

The official announcement and application form is available at (Ref
E2275)

  http://www.le.ac.uk/personnel/jobs/a&r.html

The applications should be submitted no later than 18 October 2005.

If you have any questions please contact me via email.

Best wishes,

Alexander

Dear all,

Some of you may be interested in some recent preprints from us at bangor
http://www.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/public/mathematics/research/preprints/05/05prep.html

HEALTH WARNING
As usual these are still drafts so may change. They even might contain
errors!

 I will put some of them on the Arxiv later on when I have a bit of time.

At my ftp site
ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr/pdffiles
is a note called preservinghomology.pdf that raises (but does not
satisfactorily answer) the question of what it means for an additive
functor between abelian categories to preserve homology.  It does work for
functors that are either right or left exact.  If anyone has solved (or
even looked seriously at the question) I would appreciate hearing from
them.

Hi Colin,

I was there as a freshly minted PhD about to go to my first
academic job at University of Chicago.  What i most vividly
remember was Eilenberg, sitting in the center near the front,
constantly asking smart questions, which did not necessarily
help the speaker; and in particular, of course, i remember
this during my talk on automata and recursion in cartesian
closed categories.  Frankly, i was a bit shocked at the level
of competitiveness that i felt in the institute, no doubt my
naivety showing, after spending laid back years at Berkeley.

                           CMCS 2006

8th International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science
          http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/cmcs06/cmcs06.html

                         Vienna, Austria
                        March 25-27, 2006

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 9th European Joint
Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software ETAPS 2006
                        March 25 - April 2, 2006

Aims and Scope

During the last few years, it has become increasingly clear that a
great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition
systems, automata, process calculi and class-based systems, can be
captured uniformly as coalgebras.  Coalgebra is developing into a
field of its own interest presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a
growing field of applications and interactions with various other
fields such as reactive and interactive system theory, object oriented
and concurrent programming, formal system specification, modal logic,
dynamical systems, control systems, category theory, algebra,
analysis, etc. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its
applications.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

      the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and
      categorical approaches);
      coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for
      programming languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
      coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
      coalgebras and data types;
      (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras
      (with bisimulations or invariants);
      coalgebras and algebras;
      coalgebraic specification and verification;
      coalgebras and (modal) logic;
      coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and
hybrid systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, Genova, Grenoble, Warsaw and Barcelona. The
proceedings appeared as Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer
Science (ENTCS) Volumes 11,19, 33, 41, 65.1, 82.1 and 106. You can get
an idea of the types of papers presented at the meeting by looking at
the tables of contents of the ENTCS volumes from those workshops ENTCS


Location

CMCS 2006 will be held in Vienna on March 25-27, 2006. It will be a
satellite workshop of ETAPS 2006, the European Joint Conferences on
Theory and Practice of Software.


Programme Committee

John Power (chair,Edinburgh), Luis Barbosa (Minho), Neil Ghani
(Nottingham), H. Peter Gumm (Marburg), Marina Lenisa (Udine), Stefan
Milius (Braunschweig), Larry Moss (Bloomington), Jan Rutten
(Amsterdam), Hendrik Tews (Dresden), Tarmo Uustalu (Tallinn), Hiroshi
Watanabe (Osaka).


Keynote Speaker:       Peter O'Hearn (Queen Mary, University of London)

Invited Speakers:      Corina Cirstea (University of Southampton)
                       Alexander Kurz (University of Leicester)



Submissions

Two sorts of submissions will be possible this year:

Papers to be evaluated by the programme committee for inclusion in the
ENTCS proceedings:

These papers must be written using ENTCS style files and be of length
no greater than 20 pages. They must contain original contributions, be
clearly written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison
with related work. If a submission describes software, software tools,
or their use, it should include all source code that is needed to
reproduce the results but is not publicly available. If the additional
material exceeds 5 MB, URL's of publicly available sites should be
provided in the paper.

Short contributions:

These will not be published but will be compiled into a technical
report of the University of Nottingham. They should be no more than
two pages and may describe work in progress, summarise work submitted
to a conference or workshop elsewhere, or in some other way appeal to
the CMCS audience.

Both sorts of submission should be submitted in postscript or pdf form
as attachments to an email to cmcs06@cs.nott.ac.uk.  The email should
include the title, corresponding author, and, for the first kind of
submission, a text-only one-page abstract.

After the workshop, we expect to produce a journal proceedings of
extended versions of selected papers to appear in Theoretical Computer
Science.



Important Dates

 Deadline for submission of regular papers:     January 8, 2006.
 Notification of acceptance of regular papers:  February 6, 2006.
 Final version for the preliminary proceedings: February 13, 2006.


 Deadline for submission of short contributions:      February 28, 2006.
 Notification of acceptance of short contributions:   March 6, 2006.

The final schedule for Octoberfest '05 is now available, and
can be found on the website:

http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~scpsg/Octoberfest05/Octoberfest.final1.htm

As you can see, we have a busy schedule. Rather than having a
banquet, we will provide lunch on both Saturday and Sunday.
Ottawa has many fine restaurants for dinner, and a dining guide
will be provided.

As is traditional for Octoberfest, we have managed to keep costs to
a minimum. Registration will be 25 dollars, and students may attend
for free.

We remind you that if you need parking for the weekend, you must
contact us right away.

Look forward to seeing you all soon,
Rick Blute
Phil Scott

           FM'06: 14TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FORMAL METHODS

                            21 - 27 August 2006
               McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada
                         http://fm06.mcmaster.ca/

                   ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS


FM'06 is the fourteenth in a series of symposia organized by Formal
Methods Europe, http://www.fmeurope.org, an independent association whose
aim is to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for
software development.  The symposia have been notably successful in
bringing together innovators and practitioners in precise mathematical
methods for software development, industrial users as well as
researchers.  Submissions are welcomed in the form of original papers on
research and industrial experience, proposals for workshops and
tutorials, entries for the exhibition of software tools and projects, and
reports on ongoing doctoral work.

FM'06 welcomes all aspects of formal methods research, both theoretical
and practical.  We are particularly interested in the experience of
applying formal methods in practice.  The broad topics of interest of
this conference are:

* Tools for formal methods: tool support and software engineering,
  environments for formal methods.

* Theoretical foundations: specification and modelling, refining, static
  analysis, model-checking, verification, calculation, reusable domain
  theories.

* Formal methods in practice: experience with introducing formal methods
  in industry, case studies.

* Role of formal methods: formal methods in hardware and system design,
  method integration, development process.


TECHNICAL PAPERS
Full papers should be submitted via the web site.  Papers will be
evaluated by the Program Committee according to their originality,
significance, soundness, quality of presentation and relevance with
respect to the main issues of the symposium.  Accepted papers will be
published in the Symposium Proceedings, to appear in Springer's Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series, http://www.springeronline.com/lncs .
Submitted papers should have not been submitted elsewhere for
publication, should be in Springer's format, (see Springer's web site),
and should not exceed 16 pages including appendices.  A prize for the
best technical paper will be awarded at the symposium.

INDUSTRIAL USAGE REPORTS
One day will be dedicated to sharing the experience -- both positive and
negative -- with using formal methods in industrial environments.  The
Industry Day is organized by ForTIA, the Formal Techniques Industry
Association, http://www.fortia.org .  This year's Industry Day
investigates the use of formal methods in security and trust.  Invited
papers on organizational and technical issues will be presented.
Inquiries should be directed to the Industry Day Chairs; see the web site
for details.

WORKSHOPS
We welcome proposals for one-day or one-and-a-half-day workshops related
to FM'06.  In particular, but not exclusively, we encourage proposals for
workshops on various application domains.  Proposals should be directed
to the Workshop Chair.

TUTORIALS
We are soliciting proposals for full-day or half-day tutorials.  The
tutorial contents can be selected from a wide range of topics that
reflect the conference themes and provide clear utility to practitioners.
Each proposal will be evaluated on importance, relevance, timeliness,
audience appeal and past experience and qualification of the instructors.
Proposals should be directed to the Tutorial Chair.

POSTER AND TOOL EXHIBITION
An exhibition of both research projects and commercial tools will
accompany the technical symposium, with the opportunity of holding
scheduled presentations of commercial tools.  Proposals should be
directed to the Poster and Tools Exhibition Chair.

DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM
For the first time, FM'06 will feature a doctoral symposium.  Students
are invited to submit work in progress and to defend it in front of
"friendly examiners".  Participation for students who are accepted will
be subsidized.  Submissions should be directed to the Doctoral Symposium
Chair.

-------------------------EXCUSE MULTIPLE COPIES-----------------------



Dear Colleague:

We are writing to inform you about the progress of the open-access,
online journal "Logical Methods in Computer Science," which has recently
benefited from a freshly designed web site, see:

                 http://www.lmcs-online.org

In the first year of its existence, the journal received 75 submissions:
21 were accepted and 22 declined (the rest are still in the editorial
process). The first issue is complete, and we anticipate
that will be three in all by the end of the calendar year. Our eventual
aim is to publish four issues per year. We also publish Special Issues:
to date, three are in progress, devoted to selected papers from LICS
2004, CAV 2005 and LICS 2005.

The average turn-around from submission to publication has been
7 months. This comprises a thorough refereeing and revision process:
every submission is refereed in the  normal way by two or more
referees, who apply high standards of quality.

We would encourage you to submit your best papers to Logical Methods in
Computer Science, and to encourage your colleagues to do so too.
There is a flier and a leaflet containing basic information about the
new journal on the homepage; we would appreciate your posting
and distributing them, or otherwise publicising the journal. We would
also appreciate any suggestions you may have on how we may improve the
journal.

Yours Sincerely,

Dana S. Scott (editor-in-chief)
Gordon D. Plotkin and Moshe Y. Vardi (managing editors)
Jiri Adamek (executive editor)

Dear Categorists -

If you weaken the notion of 2-category you get the notion of
bicategory.  Has anyone tried to correspondingly weaken the
notion of double category, so that a bicategory is a special
sort of "weak double category" in analogy to the ways in which
a 2-category is a special sort of double category?  Did anyone
succeed?

Best,
jb

Dear all,


This is to announce the Conference

Algebras and Coalgebras, Tools for Geometry, Physics and Computer
Science

to be held in Cairo, Egypt

March 25-30, 2006.

Conference page: http://develop.aucegypt.edu/maths/index.html

The aim of the conference is to gather mathematicians, mathematical
physicists, and computer scientists working in areas closely related
to the theory and applications of algebras and coalgebras. Besides
exchanging information about the traditional applications of algebras
to geometry, physics and computer science in this conference we want
to highlight the usefulness of coalgebraic structures in these
fields. They appear, for example, in quantum group theory, in
symplectic geometry and quantum field theory, in non-commutative
geometry, and in computer science.

Dear John,

The definition of weak (or pseudo) double category is what you would =20
expect, once you know the strict case and the definition of =20
bicategory; think of a "pseudocategory object in Cat". It has =20
probably been in the categorical folklore since quite a while.

You can find it (including the machinery of lax double functors, =20
horizontal and vertical transformations, etc.) in two papers in =20
Cahiers, where part of the general theory of weak double categories =20
has been developed

    M. Grandis - R. Pare, Limits in double categories, Cah. Topol. =20
Geom. Diff. Categ. 40 (1999), 162-220,

    - -, Adjoints for double categories,  Cah. Topol. Geom. Diff. =20
Categ. 45 (2004), 193-240.

Other papers on (weak) double categories, many of them by Bob Pare et =20=

al., are referred to in the articles above.
In book form

    Tom Leinster, Higher operads, higher categories, Cambridge Un. =20
Press 2004,

has Section 5.2, devoted to weak double categories.

At least three parties have done this:

- Bob Pare and collaborators

- at least one Australian of the Sean Carmody/Dominic Verity/Steve Lack
generation (calling them something like "double bicategories")

- me (section 5.2 of book).

There's the question of whether you weaken in just one direction or in
both.  I believe that parties 1 and 3 weaken in just one direction.  But
you write

> in analogy to the ways [*plural!*] in which a 2-category is a special
> sort of double category

so I guess you're after weakening in both directions.

            FM'06: 14TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FORMAL METHODS

                             21 - 27 August 2006
                McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada
                          http://fm06.mcmaster.ca/

                    ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS


FM'06 is the fourteenth in a series of symposia organized by Formal
Methods Europe, http://www.fmeurope.org, an independent association
whose
aim is to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for
software development.  The symposia have been notably successful in
bringing together innovators and practitioners in precise mathematical
methods for software development, industrial users as well as
researchers.  Submissions are welcomed in the form of original papers on
research and industrial experience, proposals for workshops and
tutorials, entries for the exhibition of software tools and projects,
and
reports on ongoing doctoral work.

FM'06 welcomes all aspects of formal methods research, both theoretical
and practical.  We are particularly interested in the experience of
applying formal methods in practice.  The broad topics of interest of
this conference are:

* Tools for formal methods: tool support and software engineering,
   environments for formal methods.

* Theoretical foundations: specification and modelling, refining, static
   analysis, model-checking, verification, calculation, reusable domain
   theories.

* Formal methods in practice: experience with introducing formal methods
   in industry, case studies.

* Role of formal methods: formal methods in hardware and system design,
   method integration, development process.


TECHNICAL PAPERS
Full papers should be submitted via the web site.  Papers will be
evaluated by the Program Committee according to their originality,
significance, soundness, quality of presentation and relevance with
respect to the main issues of the symposium.  Accepted papers will be
published in the Symposium Proceedings, to appear in Springer's Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series, http://www.springeronline.com/lncs .
Submitted papers should have not been submitted elsewhere for
publication, should be in Springer's format, (see Springer's web site),
and should not exceed 16 pages including appendices.  A prize for the
best technical paper will be awarded at the symposium.

INDUSTRIAL USAGE REPORTS
One day will be dedicated to sharing the experience -- both positive and
negative -- with using formal methods in industrial environments.  The
Industry Day is organized by ForTIA, the Formal Techniques Industry
Association, http://www.fortia.org .  This year's Industry Day
investigates the use of formal methods in security and trust.  Invited
papers on organizational and technical issues will be presented.
Inquiries should be directed to the Industry Day Chairs; see the web
site
for details.

WORKSHOPS
We welcome proposals for one-day or one-and-a-half-day workshops related
to FM'06.  In particular, but not exclusively, we encourage proposals
for
workshops on various application domains.  Proposals should be directed
to the Workshop Chair.

TUTORIALS
We are soliciting proposals for full-day or half-day tutorials.  The
tutorial contents can be selected from a wide range of topics that
reflect the conference themes and provide clear utility to
practitioners.
Each proposal will be evaluated on importance, relevance, timeliness,
audience appeal and past experience and qualification of the
instructors.
Proposals should be directed to the Tutorial Chair.

POSTER AND TOOL EXHIBITION
An exhibition of both research projects and commercial tools will
accompany the technical symposium, with the opportunity of holding
scheduled presentations of commercial tools.  Proposals should be
directed to the Poster and Tools Exhibition Chair.

DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM
For the first time, FM'06 will feature a doctoral symposium.  Students
are invited to submit work in progress and to defend it in front of
"friendly examiners".  Participation for students who are accepted will
be subsidized.  Submissions should be directed to the Doctoral Symposium
Chair.

Dear Categorists -

Thanks for all the helpful replies!

Yes, I need weakening in both directions for my particular
application (to quantum gravity, in fact).  So, I need to
get ahold of Dominic Verity's thesis.

Best,

Subject: categories: abelian stuff
Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca
Precedence: bulk

At the recent Ottawa conference I repeated, in passing, something I've
been saying for over 30 years: given a subcategory of an abelian
category the finite bi-closure is, of course, obtainable by
alternately adjoining limits and colimits countably often; remarkably
enough, one need only do two cycles (assuming direct sums that's
kernels, cokernels, kernels, cokernels). The proof is a consequence of
of the construction of free abelian categories. Susan asked me later
if I had ever actually worked out a direct proof. Nope.

But it became apparent to me, thinking about what I had had to say
about free abelian categories that I didn't know 30 years ago, that it
shouldn't take two cycles, just one:


           In the abelian setting, adjoining finite limits
               commutes with adjoining finite colimits.


(No -- for those old enough to remember -- this is not still 1969 and
Ottawa is not Seattle.)

There are some finicky points one must deal with when talking about
images of functors (in the case at hand, functors such as those that
assign kernels to maps), so let me just cut here to a critical little
lemma that says, in effect, "a kernel of a map between cokernels is a
cokernel of a map between kernels:"

LEMMA: In an abelian category an exact diagram of the form (all
       vertical arrows are downwards):

         c
      B --> A --> F --> O

    b |   a |     |

      B'--> A'--> F'--> O
         c'

     may be enlarged to an exact diagram of the form:


            O --> K'--> A + B'+ B --> A + A'

                  |         |           |

            O --> K ----> A + B'------> A'

                  |
         c
      B --> A --> F --> O

    b |   a |     |

      B'--> A'--> F'--> O
         c'

The exactness of  K'--> K --> F --> F' says, precisely, that the
kernel of  F --> F' is the cokernel of  K'--> K.

The middle vertical  K --> F  is  K --> A + B'--> A  --> F  where
A + B'--> A  is the projection map. (For present purposes a projection
map is one given by a matrix in which each entry is  1  if such fits
else  0.)

The two top-right vertical maps are also projection maps.

The two top-right horizontal maps are given (as luck would have it) by
matrices in which each entry is  1  or a single letter (a,b,c,c') if
such fits, else  0.

It's not hard to verify this lemma in the category of abelian groups,
which -- given the exact representation theorem -- suffices for all
abelian categories. As if often the case, the proof of the dual of the
lemma harder in the concrete case:

CO-LEMMA: In an abelian category an exact diagram of the form (all
          vertical arrows are downwards):

                                         c'
                          O --> K'--> A'--> B'

                                |     | a   | b

                          O --> K --> A --> B
                                         c

          may be enlarged to an exact diagram of the form:

                                         c'
                          O --> K'--> A'--> B'

                                |     | a   | b

                          O --> K --> A --> B
                                         c
                                |

          A'------> A + B'----> F --> O

          |           |         |

        A'+ A --> A + B'+ B --> F'--> O


For the record, note that "a kernel of a map between kernels is a
kernel," that is, the same initial exact diagram may be enlarged to a
diagram:with exact rows and exact left column:

                            O

                            |

                     O ---> K''--> A'--> A + B;

                            |      |       |
                                       c'
                     O ---> K'---> A'----> B'

                            |      | a     | b

                     O ---> K ---> A ----> B
                                       c

The two upper-right verticals are projection maps and the upper right
horizontal map is given by a matrix in which each entry is a single
letter (a,c').

Also for the record: the finite bi-completion of an additive
category is not abelian. Start with the additive closure of a single
map  f:A --> B. In the finite bi-completion the canonical map from
Cok(Ker(f))  to  Ker(Cok(f))  will not be an isomorphism. In the
finite _abelian_ finite bi-completion, of course, it must be. (It is
precisely this isomorphism, invoked at the end of the Lemma in the
case  f  =  K --> F, that delivers the commutativity of finite left
and right completions.)

Dear All,

In addition to all comments and references given to John Baez, I would like
to mention MSc Thesis of my student Nelson Martins-Ferreira, and the paper

N. Martins-Ferreira: "Weak categories in additive categories with kernels",
Fields Institute Communications, Vol. 43, 2004, 387-410

(and its references). Nelson uses a notion of an internal weak category in a
2-category there (Page 391, Definition 6) and several related/more special
notions to develop a convenient setting for 2-dimensional "abelianization".
And I would like to use this opportunity to repeat few remarks on the story
of abelianization of categorical structures, which I briefly made in my talk
on CT1995 in Halifax:

(i) It is well known (precise references to be found in various surveys of
Ronnie Brown) for a long time that internal 2-categories in an additive
category A with kernels can be identified with composable pairs (f,g) of
morphisms in A with fg = 0, and that the same is true for n-categories, with
n-sequences instead of pairs. Hence, whenever somebody comes up with, say, a
new notion of a weak n-category, I would ask: what are the internal weak
n-categories in YOUR sense in the category Ab of abelian groups? (Of course
this question is "Yoneda invariant", and so there is no difference between
considering the category Ab and considering an abstract additive category
with kernels here)

(ii) Why do we expect a simple answer to the question above? The point is,
that most of higher categorical structures involve composition/coherence
maps between pullbacks of split epimorphisms - and in the additive case,
using kernels of those morphisms, one presents such pullbacks as direct sums
and the composition/coherence maps as matrices. Therefore I expect an
internal weak n-category in YOUR sense in the category of abelian groups to
be nothing but an additive functor from a fixed finitely generated category
X to Ab. The only question is: what is X?

(iii) There are many examples showing that making comparisons between higher
categorical structures might be highly nontrivial; so why not examining
first what will happen to them in the simple additive/abelian world?
Furthermore, and more generally, if T is a finite limit theory, then the
free-forgetful adjunction between Sets and Ab "induces" an adjunction
between Models(T) = Models(T,Sets) and Models(T,Ab), and the abelianization
(=the left adjoint in that adjunction) Models(T) ---> Models(T,Ab) should
help to study the category Models(T). Note that when T is the theory of
groups, the abelianization functor becomes the usual one, and so it
coincides with the first homology group functor (with coefficients in the
additive group of integers).

Answering the question from (i), one would certainly begin with
bicategories, and, as far as I know, Nelson was the first who has described
internal bicategories in additive categories with kernels, and I gave a talk
on Nelson's work on Australian Category Seminar in March 2002 - before
Nelson himself presented his more general results on the Meeting on Galois
Theory, Hopf Algebras, and Semiabelian Categories at Field Institute
(Toronto, September 2002).

Now results:

As shown by Nelson in the abovementioned paper (Section 5.2), an internal
weak category in Mor(Ab) (=Cat(Ab)) (which is a special case of Nelson's
more general result!) can be identified with a diagram in Ab consisting of
morphisms

d : A_1 ---> A_0, d' : B_1 ---> B_0, k : A_1 ---> B_1, k' : A_0 ---> B_0,

l, r : A_0 ---> A_1, and h : B_0 ---> A_1

with k'd = d'k, kl = kr = 0 and kh = 0. It becomes

(a) a bicategory, if B_1 = 0;
(b) a double category if l = r = 0 and h = 0;
(c) hence, a 2-category if B_1 = 0, l = r = 0 and h = 0.

Nelson also examines what would happen without the coherence conditions, and
then gets much more complicated formulas (See Proposition 6 in his paper).

What Nelson has not done is what Tom Leinster calls "weakening in both
directions". Another temptation is the (non-abelian) group case, hence
generalizing crossed complexes. Let me also mention

S. E. Crans: "Teisi in Ab", Homology, Homotopy and Applications 3, 2001,
87-100,

although I do not know if anyone has considered a "double-" version of
Crans' teisi.
