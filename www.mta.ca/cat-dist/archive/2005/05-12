[note from moderator: the poster is right, this discussion is not relevant
to this list, and this final post is allowed as a response to the previous
post only.]

I feel guilty about prolonging a discussion which is not related to
categories. If the moderator thinks we should take it off line, we can
do so (see the end of this posting). But since the last message was
public and it asked for a reaction, I will reply in the same fashion.

Thank you to Jean Benabou for posting the message by Jacqueline Zizi. I
would like to make a couple of remarks.

First of all, I want it to be clear that Jacqueline and I are on the
same side. I am a big fan of Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). I promote
them at our department and I teach my students how to use them to solve
problems they meet in analysis and algebra. I show them examples from
their analysis class which their teacher solved incorrectly but
Mathematica gets them right.

I shall now also teach them how to compute the limit correctly, thanks
to Jacqueline's suggestion. By the way, there is no need to compute the
power expansion of numerator and denominator separately. You can just
compute Series[...] of the whole thing:

In[42] := Series[((1 + 4*x^2)^(1/4) - (1 + 5*x^2)^(1/5))/
  (a^(-x^2/2) - Cos[x]), {x, 0, 4}] // Simplify

Out[42] = x^2/(1 - Log[a]) + (...) x^4 + O[x^5]

You see immediately that things go wrong when Log[a] = 1 ...

>> But I have the impression that Andrej himself falls in the trap.

I fail to see how I fall in _the_ trap, i.e., that I make the same sort
of mistakes as students and CAS. I surely hope I do not :-) Perhaps, it
was meant that I just made a mistake when I stated:

>> And especially when he says that :
>> " I guess I am trying to point out that current Computer Alegbra
>> Systems are very tricky to use_correctly"

This is an observation about user experience, namely that one cannot
trust CAS 100% without having a lot of expert knowledge about it. You
may have a different experience, but mine is as stated.

I find most of Jacqueline's comments to be explanations about why CAS
are not 100% mathematically correct all the time: they are complex, they
grow with time, etc. This is all true and well, and I am NOT saying that
any CAS which is not 100% correct all the time should be eliminated from
the face of the Earth.

However, I do take issue with the fact that CAS are presented in a
dishonest way. A typical CAS demo does not show you that things can go
wrong. The documentation does NOT state clearly the conditions under
which builtin functions may be used, contrary to what Jacqueline says:

>> The rules for application of the primitives are
>> clearly given in Mathematica, in the "Help" menu.

You make it sound as if a user who reads the help menu for "Limit" will
know that free parameters may sometimes lead to errors. Here is the
complete text of help:

--------
Limit

Limit[expr, x->x_0] finds the limiting value of expr when x approaches x_0.

* Example: Limit[Sin[x]/x, x->0] --> 1.
* Limit[expr, x->x_0, Direction -> 1] computes the limit as x approaches
x_0 from smaller values.
* Limit[expr, x->x_0, Direction -> -1] computes the limit as x
approaches x_0 from larger values.
* Limit returns Interval objects to represent ranges of possible values,
for example at essential singularities.
* Limit returns unevaluated when it encounters functions about which it
has no specific information. Limit therefore makes no explicit
assumptions about symbolic functions.
* See The Mathematica Book: Section 1.5.10 and Section 3.6.8.
* See also: Series, Residue.
* Related package: NumericalMath`NLimit`.
---------

I let the readers judge whether "Limit therefore makes no explicit
assumptions about symbolic functions" makes it clear that using
parameters in limits can cause wrong answers. Additionally, there is no
hint whatsoever that Mathematica will apply l'Hospital rule (or
something equivalent) without checking the side condition for it.

The reason why conditions of correct usage are not stated clearly is
simple: nobody knows them. CAS are so complex and so liberal about which
rule gets applied when that it is next to impossible to write down
precisely when they will work correctly.

I understand that CAS are complex and that we would get nowhere if we
worried about correctness all the time. But the makers of CAS should be
honest about this: CAS do NOT state clearly the conditions under which
they work correctly, therefore it is difficult to know whether they have
given a correct answer. Jacqueline herself wonders about correctness of
the results she gets in her third example at
http://homepage.mac.com/jacquelinezizi/CategoriesQA/.

It is an open problem, as far I can tell, to create a powerful CAS with
perfect control of correctness.

I suggest that we take further discussion off the categories list. One
possible forum is my blog at http://math.andrej.com, where I posted
further examples of how Mathematica gets things wrong at

Does anyone know a reference for

is the nerve of a groupoid
or if anyone observed it earlier?

Le mercredi 30 Novembre 2005 23:24, vous avez =E9crit :

Indeed, at least in my case, a flow must not be viewed as a generalizatio=
n of=20
the notion of small categories. Let me explain a little bit what I am doi=
ng=20
with these objects. I was not very explicit in my previous post. And so t=
he=20
terminology I use is not in "competition".

I want to model HDA, at least those coming from precubical sets. I use a =
set=20
of states X^0 and between each state A and B of the HDA, there is a=20
topological space P_{A,B}X whose elements represent the non-constant=20
execution paths from A to B. The topology of this space models the=20
concurrency of the situation between A and B. And execution paths can be=20
composed with a strictly asssociative law. There does not necessarily exi=
st a=20
loop from a given state A to itself : so P_{A,A}X can be empty. This fact=
 is=20
one reason among several other ones why I remove the identity maps.

Inside this model, I am able to define what is a dihomotopy equivalence. =
The=20
main problem to define dihomotopy is that some contractible parts of "the=
=20
directed spaces of execution paths" must not be contracted. Otherwise in =
the=20
categorical localization, the relevant geometric information is lost. In=20
particular, initial and final states must be unchanged by a dihomotopy=20
equivalence. A very simple example : take two execution paths going from =
one=20
initial state 0 to one final state 1. If contractions in the direction of=
 time=20
are allowed, one finds in the same equivalence class a loop. Some example=
s of=20
unwanted final states are deadlocks of concurrent systems : a deadlock is=
=20
nothing else but a final state from a geometric viewpoint. Flows allow to=
=20
propose a solution of this problem : in fact I introduced this notion of=20
flows on purpose, to make the following solution work.=20

The first kind of dihomotopy equivalence is a morphism f:X->Y such that=20
f^0:X^0->Y^0 is a bijection and such that Pf:PX->PY is a weak homotopy=20
equivalence. It turns out that there is a model structure on Flows whose =
weak=20
equivalences are exactly the preceding kind of morphisms. By imposing the=
=20
condition f^0:X^0->Y^0 bijective, we do not take any risk : nothing is=20
contracted in the direction of time. So no geometric information is lost.=
 But=20
this kind of identification is too rigide ! The second kind of dihomotopy=
=20
equivalence is generated by taking a representative set of inclusions of=20
posets P1\subset P2, where P1 and P2 are finite bounded posets and where =
the=20
inclusions preserve the bottom  element and the top element (which are=20
different by hypothesis in a bounded poset). For example, the inclusion o=
f=20
posets {0<1}\subset{0<A<1} represents the directed segment (going from th=
e=20
initial state 0 to the final state 1) identified with the composition of =
two=20
directed segments. This second kind of dihomotopy equivalence models=20
"refinement of observation". Of course, initial and final states are stil=
l=20
preserved.

The category of flows up to dihomotopy equivalences is between the homoto=
py=20
category of the model structure associated to the first kind of dihomotop=
y=20
equivalence and the homotopy category of the Bousfield localization of th=
e=20
same model structures with respect to the set of Q(P_1\subset P_2) where =
Q is=20
the cofibrant replacement functor. I call the weak equivalences of the=20
Bousfield localization "quasi-dihomotopy". Morally speaking, quasi-dihomo=
topy=20
is like dihomotopy except in non-observable areas of the time flow where =
the=20
topological configuration can changed.

I think that such squares should be called "exact" or =20
"semicartesian" (where cartesian square =3D pb).
They should be viewed as the natural self-dual generalisation of =20
pullback and pushout. They appear whenever one studies categories of =20
relations.

1. In an abelian category, I would prefer "exact", or "Hilton-exact".

Hilton considered such squares (for abelian categories), and proved =20
that an equivalent condition is that this square (of proper =20
morphisms) is "bicommutative" in the category of relations (i.e. it =20
commutes and stays commutative when you reverse two "parallel" arrows =20=

- as relations).

Plainly:   bicartesian square  =3D>  pullback  =3D>  exact;  and dually.

REFERENCE:
P. Hilton, Correspondences and exact squares, in: Proc. Conf. on =20
Categorical Algebra, La Jolla 1965, Springer, pp. 254-271.

2. Studying more general categories of relations, I considered =20
"semicartesian squares"  (f,g, h,k),  defined - in any category - by =20
the following self-dual property (after being commutative, of course):

  Whenever  (f',g', h,k)  and  (f,g, h',k')  commute, also the =20
external square  (f',g', h',k')  commutes

                             B
           f'            f        h          h'
   A'             A                D             D'
           g'          g       k           k'
                            C

(add slanting arrows  f': A' --> B,  f: A --> B,   etc).

- Again: bicartesian square  =3D>  pullback  =3D>  semicartesian,  and =20=

dually.

- If pb's  and/or  po's exist, one can give a lot of equivalent =20
properties; eg:

--  (f,g)  and the pb of  (h,k) have the same po (or the same =20
commutative squares out of them).

- In an abelian category, semicartesian amounts to the previous notion.
- In Set, it characterises again those squares which are =20
bicommutative in Rel.

2-cells), was introduced by Guitart, and called "H-exact", if I =20
remember well (H for Hilton)

This kind of condition occurs in topology as a fibrant square - but where
all the maps are fibrations as is the map A ---> B x_D C . This can be
generalised to cubes. See a paper by R. Steiner on

`Resolutions of spaces by n-cubes of fibrations',  J. London Math. Soc.(2),
34, 169-176, 1986

used to build a complete (strict) algebraic model of homotopy n-types which
allows some computations.

This raises the spectre in algebra of

Resolutions of A by free  crossed n-cubes of A.

to give a more `nonabelian' homological algebra. Of course crossed n-cubes
of A should be equivalent to n-fold groupoids in A. This would presumably
bring in higher versions of nonabelian tensor products in A; a bibliography
of such a tensor, mainly for n=2, has 90 items.

This probably does not help to answer Mike's question on the name!

Peter Freyd's recent posting of the `Categories Anonymous' skit
prompted me to dig out and transcribe an even older skit which
originated with the Chicago Junior Math Club, and which stars
Saunders Mac Lane as the evil villain Chalkfinger. I don't know its
exact date: it should be datable by the reference at the end to
Chalkfinger's visit to Japan, but although Saunders refers to that
visit in his autobiography (p. 297) he doesn't quote the date. The
typescript copy which I have (and which I acquired from Murray
Adelman in 1984) was apparently revised for performance
at the Bowdoin Summer Advanced Seminar in Homological Algebra (again,
I don't know the year). If anyone knows more details of the history
of the skit, I'd be interested to hear them.

SCENE 1

Opening: [Goldfinger theme heard. Jacobson writes on blackboard]

Jacobson: Good evening, welcome to the Junior Math Club's
          presentation of Chalkfinger.

[He is dragged off. A scream is heard offstage,]

[Desk of K, chair for Miss Chestcough]

K:        Miss Chestcough!

Chest:    [cough] Yes?

[Bailout runs in.]

Bailout:  Who coughed?

Chest:    Me, Professor Bailout.

Bailout:  Well, don't let it happen again. [exit]

Chest:    {aside] That was a young right idealist.

K:        Miss Chestcough, see if you can get Agent 00\pi on the red
          telephone.

Chest:    At 8.30 in the morning? Well, I'll try K., but 00\pi is
          always so irrational at this hour. [exits to call]

K:        Hmmm. How does she know that?

[Chestcough returns, after a minute Bond enters]

Bond:     [flirting] Hello, pigeon. Why do I chase around the world
          when there are girls like you at home?

Chest:    [smiles] You'd better go in to see K., but I'll be here
          when you get back.

[Bond crosses to K.'s desk, sits down. K. stares at him for *long*
moment.]

K:        Could you give me an epsilon of your time?

Bond:     Make it epsilon over 2. What's up, Boss?

K:        Well, it's Chalkfinger. He's been at our chalk supply
          again. Why, that man is responsible for most of the world's
          illicit traffic in colored chalk.

Bond:     But what does he use it for?

K:        You won't believe this. He proves theorems about
          categories!

Bond:     [laughs] That's ridiculous! [does double-take] What's a
          category?

K:        Why, don't you know? You're not up with the times, Bond.
          As I understand it, categories arose from Pavlov's
          experiments with dogs. Pavlov trained dogs to expect meat at
          the sound of a bell. Then he took the meat away, but the
          dogs continued to salivate when the bell was rung. Now
          Chalkfinger has taken the meat out of mathematics, but
          mathematicians still salivate at the sound of the bell.

Bond:     Insidious!

K:        You bet. Now I want you to infiltrate their organization.

Bond:     But suppose I don't make the grade?

K:        You'll do it, Yitz. I'm putting my money on Israel Bond.

Bond:     Thank you, sir. I'll try to protect your interest. Say,
          whatever happened to that last case you were working on?

K:        I couldn't get anywhere on it, so I turned it over to a
          graduate student. Now, for your equipment: [they stand up]
          We've prepared for you a white Jaguar complete with left and
          right annihilators, deformation retract and portable pool
          table. Here's the key to the locked stall in the third floor
          john. We'll communicate as usual by leaving messages under
          the seat. Use all the paper you want, and good luck!

[Exeunt -- Alperin and Thompson make first crossing of stage]


SCENE 2

[Students playing chess]

Student 1: Going to the colloquium today? All the big operators from
           Spectrum are going to be there: Big Ziggy, Big Pedro and
           even Big Browser, their [gestures] elliptic operator.

Student 2: Nah, I'm too busy playing chess.

Student 1: Oh, Chalkfinger won't like that.

[long pause -- Chalkfinger enters with Oddprime]

Chalk:     By thunder, you know what can happen to students like
           you? Oddprime! Hat!

[Oddprime throws frisbee, something breaks]

Chalk:     Hah, Oddprime can divide anything. [Bond enters] Welcome
           to our organization, Mr Bond. We're looking forward to
           your course in Hopf algebras. Let me show you around.
           Manishevitz, here, is working on a computer program to
           determine the first odd square.

Manish:    My name is Manishevitz, but you can call me Manishevitz
           if you want.

Bond:      That looks like difficult work.

Manish:    Any child in first grade could do it. It's all a matter
           of gamesmanship.

Chalk:     Good man to talk to, Bond, if you can get through the
           queue at his door. Over there is Filterfish, still trying
           to disprove that the Arabs invented algebra.

Filter:    [whispers] What is the password?

Bond:      Ultra-filter.

Filter:    You must be the man from K.

Bond:      Your image is my kernel, Daddy-O.

Filter:    Exactly.

Chalk:     Mr Bond, do you subscribe to the Dieudonne doctrine or
           the category of vector spaces?

Bond:      Category, shmategory, I don't go for that crap.

Chalk:     Categories crap? The man's a spy! Seize him! [all seize
           him] What do we do with spies?

Manish:    We could boil him to death in Eckhart 312.

Filter:    Or make him teach Math 101.

Chalk:     I know, we'll put him trough the pull-back.

Oddprime:  Heh, heh, heh, through the push-out and the pull-back!

All:       Through the pull-back! [They drag Bond out]

Bond:      You may torture my body, but you'll never annihilate my
           ideals.

[Screams heard offstage, they bring back his unconscious body and
throw it on the floor. Oddprime stands guard. Pussy enters]

Pussy:     Izzy dead?

Oddprime:  No, Izzy just tired.

[Bond rises slowly, shakes himself]

Bond:      Well, hello.

Pussy:     Hi! My name is Pussy Galois.

Bond:      [half-fainting again] Wow, are you ever projective!

Pussy:     Not only that, I'm free.

Bond:      [stands up] I'd like to prove that.

Pussy:     It's been tried before but [sitting down] maybe your
           techniques are better.

Bond:      [joining her] Say, Pussy, how does Chalkfinger smuggle
           his chalk out of the building?

Pussy:     Oh, haven't you ever figured that out? He hides it in his
           baggy pants.

Bond:      Ingenious!

[Alperin and Thompson make second crossing]

Bond:      What in the world?

Pussy:     Oh, they always do that. Come with me: [takes his hand]
           we'll eavesdrop on Chalkfinger's meeting with Spectrum.


SCENE 3

[Ziggy, Pedro and Browser on stage]

Pedro:     What'cha got there, Big Ziggy?

Ziggy:     It's Chalkfinger's latest masterpiece, which I've
           acquired at considerable expense

Pedro:     Let's see: [reads] 'In the beginning Chalkfinger created
           the category and the functor, but the category was void
           and the functor was forgetful. And Chalkfinger said "Let
           there be maps", and there were maps. And Chalkfinger
           called the maps morphisms, and the members of the category
           he called objects, and Chalkfinger thought that was pretty
           good, and so did his friend Sammy. And there was evening
           and there was morning in 1945.'

Ziggy:     This beats analysis.

Browser:   Sounds like a very theological subject. [takes the book]
           'And on the sixth day, Chalkfinger created mathematicians
           and set them to work in the categories' -- oh, surely
           that's going too far!

Pedro:     Shh! Here he comes.

[Chalkfinger and Lin Ton enter]

Chalk:     Gentlemen, meet my Chinese assistant Lin Ton. I never
           understand you analysts, so I've brought along Lin Ton to
           interpret for me.

Lin Ton:   Have you brought the shipment?

Pedro:     Yes, it's all here. [They deposit chalk in a box] We had
           some trouble, though. Bailout keeps destroying the red
           chalk.

Ziggy:     I notice you keep the colored chalk in a separate box.

Lin Ton:   Separate but equal.

Browser:   Maybe we can integrate it while we're here.

Chalk:     You know, I had the strangest dream last night. I dreamed
           that I was surrounded by seven lean sheaves and seven
           flabby sheaves, and the seven lean sheaves came and
           devoured the seven flabby sheaves.

Pedro:     A singular dream!

Ziggy:     I think you need a different kind of analyst.

Browser:   Yeah, now look, Chalkfinger. We've all made our
           deliveries of colored chalk. You promised us that your
           categories would yield us theorems. This is Ext-Tor-tion!

Chalk:     Gentlemen, I wouldn't dream of going back on a promise.
           If you want, I'll give you a theorem apiece; but first I
           will demonstrate my new secret weapon.

Pedro:     Is he on the level?

Ziggy:     I don't know. It's hard to take the measure of the man.

Chalk:     You are about to witness the power of the Grothendieck
           ring! [Pulls out ring]

Lin Ton:   That ring is nil, try this one.

Browser:   With that ring, I thee dread.

Chalk:     You'd better ... [pushing him away] because none of you
           are getting out of here alive! [He runs offstage]

[Hissing noises heard from left and right]

Lin Ton:   Oh no, it's the thermostats!

Ziggy:     Poison gas.

Browser:   [on left] Ahh, I'm being annihilated on the left!

Pedro:     [on right] And I on the right!

[All collapse; Chalkfinger appears in front]

Chalk:     [aside] Hah, a swift death for a Swift Professor.

Bond:      I saw the whole thing, Chalkfinger. Your heinous crimes
           will not go unpunished.

[Chalkfinger trips Bond, they fall, the ring slides away]

Pussy:     The Grothendieck ring -- it's going to explode!

[Explosion noise, chairs overturned, everybody collapses]

[Alperin and Thompson make final crossing, oblivious to everything]

[Bond gets up, brushes himself off]

Bond:      Good thing I'm immune to radical rings!  And so the
           tragic tale fo Chalkfinger comes to its untimely end. The
           explosion of the Grothendieck ring was powerful enough to
           cast Chalkfinger all the way to Japan. Because of this
           affair, K. had to hide out in England for a year, and I've
           earned an extended vacation on the Mediterranean.

These are called "quasi-pullbacks" by Joyal, and they form a class of
"open maps" in the category of squares. The pullbacks form the
corresponding class of etal maps. These two classes are essential for the
development of the theory (etal class and open class in the sense of
Joyal). There are published articles by Joyal and Moerdijk on the
subject.

In reply to M. Barr's posting.

Richard Wood tells me that my posting on this subject, dated 2 =20
December 2005, was unreadable with 'elm' and nearly so with 'pine', =20
due to rich-text marks.
I am reposting it in plain text (hopefully), with a few small =20
additions - and apologies

I think that such squares should be called "exact" or =20
"semicartesian" (where cartesian square =3D pb, cocartesian =3D po).
They should be viewed as the natural self-dual generalisation of =20
pullback and pushout (and their name should be "self-dual", in some =20
way). They appear whenever one studies categories of relations.

1. In an abelian category (where they are chracterised by the exact =20
sequence you have mentioned), I would prefer "exact", or "Hilton-exact".
Hilton considered such squares (for abelian categories), and proved =20
that an equivalent condition is that this square (of proper =20
morphisms) is "bicommutative" in the category of relations (i.e. it =20
commutes and stays commutative when you reverse two "parallel" arrows =20=

- as relations).

Plainly:   bicartesian square  =3D>  pullback  =3D>  exact;  and dually.

REFERENCE:
P. Hilton, Correspondences and exact squares, in: Proc. Conf. on =20
Categorical Algebra, La Jolla 1965, Springer, pp. 254-271.

2. Studying more general categories of relations, I considered =20
"semicartesian squares"  (f,g, h,k),  defined - in any category - as =20
the commutative squares satisfying the following self-dual property:

  Whenever  (f',g', h,k)  and  (f,g, h',k')  commute, also the outer =20
square  (f',g', h',k')  commutes

                          B
         f'           f        h          h'
   A'          A                 D          D'
         g'          g        k          k'
                         C

(add slanting arrows  f': A' --> B,  g': A --> C,  f: A --> B,  etc).

- Again: bicartesian square  =3D>  pullback  =3D>  semicartesian,  and =20=

dually.

- If pb's  and/or  po's exist, there are a lot of equivalent =20
properties; eg:

--  (f,g)  and the pb of  (h,k)  have the same po (or the same =20
commutative squares out of them).

- In an abelian category, semicartesian amounts to the previous notion.
- In Set, it characterises again those squares which are =20
bicommutative in Rel.

3. A 2-dimensional version of this property (actually a STRUCTURE on =20
2-cells), was introduced by Guitart, and called "H-exact", if I =20
remember well (H for Hilton)

Continuation of namings

(1) -  Is there a standard name for the squares where the canonical map=20=

is monic , i.e. the pair of maps A --->B  and  A --->C is jointly =20
monic. I propose semi-pullback

(2)- In most cases the canonical map being epic is not what one really=20=

wants. Of course Joyal assumes the category where the maps live to be a=20=

pre-topos, then it's enough, otherwise one cannot "compose" such=20
squares.  Do we have to rename the squares where the canonical map is a=20=

universal epi, or those where its a universal regular epi?

In view of (1), one would like to say that a square is a pullback iff=20
it is both a quasi and semi pullback

I remember the skit well, because it named my thesis advisor-to-be after
his somewhat oriental looks as Lin Ton.  That puts the skit as the year
Fred spent many months at Chicago which was the year before the Bowdoin
conference on homological algebra which was held in the summer of 1965 as
an NSF summer Advanced Seminar.  It was at the seminar that I first met
Fred and I did not meet him the previous year precisely because he was at
Chicago.

I am writing about matters to do with computation of colimits of a category
X in terms of colimits of a category B when there is a bifibration P: X -->
B.

Terminology already in use is

P is cartesian
P is cocartesian
a lifting of u in B to \phi in X may be cartesian, cocartesian

on the other hand Paul Taylor, following Peter Johnstone, I understand, uses
\phi is prone, supine, instead of cartesian, cocartesian

For the cofibration (?opfibration?) Ob: Groupoids  --> Sets, Philip Higgins
(1971) and I (1968) have previously used  `universal' for cocartesian. In
this situation, I would be happier with say 0-final instead of universal.
But `supine' does not ring a bell with me, and carries  a  pejorative tone.

Maybe for the general situation P: X --> B we could use
P-initial, P-final morphism in X
for cartesian, cocartesian  morphism
which would at least carry some intuition as to the meaning. Comments?

I need to make a decision soon for the revision of my old topology book. Not
much will be changed, and I might leave the old terminology and refer to
more modern uses. However for the book on Nonabelian algebraic topology, I
really do need to use modern terminologym, whatever that is, so it would be
best to be consistent.

I have been looking at Thomas Streicher's notes on fibrations, and at Paul
Taylor's Practical Foundations.

For my interest, see slides of a recent seminar at Oxford

www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/oxford2811105.pdf

called `Induced constructions and their computation'.

This is the 2nd Call for Papers for CMCS 2006




                           CMCS 2006

8th International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science
          http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/cmcs06/cmcs06.html

                         Vienna, Austria
                        March 25-27, 2006

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 9th European Joint
Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software ETAPS 2006
                        March 25 - April 2, 2006

Aims and Scope

During the last few years, it has become increasingly clear that a
great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition
systems, automata, process calculi and class-based systems, can be
captured uniformly as coalgebras.  Coalgebra is developing into a
field of its own interest presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a
growing field of applications and interactions with various other
fields such as reactive and interactive system theory, object oriented
and concurrent programming, formal system specification, modal logic,
dynamical systems, control systems, category theory, algebra,
analysis, etc. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its
applications.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

      the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and
      categorical approaches);
      coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for
      programming languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
      coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
      coalgebras and data types;
      (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras
      (with bisimulations or invariants);
      coalgebras and algebras;
      coalgebraic specification and verification;
      coalgebras and (modal) logic;
      coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and
hybrid systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, Genova, Grenoble, Warsaw and Barcelona. The
proceedings appeared as Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer
Science (ENTCS) Volumes 11,19, 33, 41, 65.1, 82.1 and 106. You can get
an idea of the types of papers presented at the meeting by looking at
the tables of contents of the ENTCS volumes from those workshops ENTCS


Location

CMCS 2006 will be held in Vienna on March 25-27, 2006. It will be a
satellite workshop of ETAPS 2006, the European Joint Conferences on
Theory and Practice of Software.


Programme Committee

John Power (chair,Edinburgh), Luis Barbosa (Minho), Neil Ghani
(Nottingham), H. Peter Gumm (Marburg), Marina Lenisa (Udine), Stefan
Milius (Braunschweig), Larry Moss (Bloomington), Jan Rutten
(Amsterdam), Hendrik Tews (Dresden), Tarmo Uustalu (Tallinn), Hiroshi
Watanabe (Osaka).

Invited Speakers:      Corina Cirstea (University of Southampton)
                       Alexander Kurz (University of Leicester)



Submissions

Two sorts of submissions will be possible this year:

Papers to be evaluated by the programme committee for inclusion in the
ENTCS proceedings:

These papers must be written using ENTCS style files and be of length
no greater than 20 pages. They must contain original contributions, be
clearly written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison
with related work. If a submission describes software, software tools,
or their use, it should include all source code that is needed to
reproduce the results but is not publicly available. If the additional
material exceeds 5 MB, URL's of publicly available sites should be
provided in the paper.

Short contributions:

These will not be published but will be compiled into a technical
report of the University of Nottingham. They should be no more than
two pages and may describe work in progress, summarise work submitted
to a conference or workshop elsewhere, or in some other way appeal to
the CMCS audience.

Both sorts of submission should be submitted in postscript or pdf form
as attachments to an email to cmcs06@cs.nott.ac.uk.  The email should
include the title, corresponding author, and, for the first kind of
submission, a text-only one-page abstract.

After the workshop, we expect to produce a journal proceedings of
extended versions of selected papers to appear in Theoretical Computer
Science.

`Prone' and `supine' were invented by Paul Taylor; I copied them from him,
not the other way round. I'm sorry Ronnie doesn't like them; they seem to
me a very neat way of finding two words that both mean `lying
horizontally' but have an opposite handedness about them.

Jean asks:

  Is there a standard name for the squares where the canonical map
  is monic , i.e. the pair of maps A --->B  and  A --->C is jointly
  monic.

In the early 60s at the annual AMS meeting held at Denver, Eilenberg,
Mac Lane and I sat down to "settle" the terminology. ("Denver One" I
called it.) There were just two things we totally agreed on: "weak" is
the operator on definitions that removes uniqueness conditions and
"partial" the operator that removes existence conditions. So the
answer to Jean's question would be "partial pullback".

As for the other side -- when the pair of maps are jointly epic --
I've seen them called "near-pullbacks" in the theoretical computer
science community. Functors between regular categories that preserve
near-pullbacks are precisely those that preserve "weak tabulations"
of (n-ary) relations.

I do not know the original problem of M. Barr, may be he is really
interested in getting an epimorphism onto the pullback.

However - I apologise for insisting - I think that the important
notion for such squares should be a natural self-dual generalisation
of pullbacks and pushouts, based on commutative squares and nothing
else - so that, in particular, it cannot depend on the variation of
monos or epis one is interested in.

The one I have proposed in that old paper (under the name of
"semicartesian square") is of this kind:

- the square  (f,g; h,k)  commutes, and for every span  (f',g')
which commutes with the cospan  (h,k)  and every cospan  (h',k')
which commutes with the span  (f,g),  the new span and cospan form a
commutative square.

All this comes from the obvious Galois connection between sets of
spans and cospans (in an arbitrary category), derived from the
commutativity relation.

Explicitly, let us start with two fixed objects A, B.  Let  S  be the
set of spans from A to B:

x = (f: C -> A,  g: C -> B)    (for arbitrary C)

and  C  the set of cospans

y = (h: A -> D, k: B  -> D)   (for arbitrary D).

Take their set of parts,  PS  and  PC,  ordered by inclusion, and the
following (contravariant) Galois connection between them (X in PS, Y
in PC):

R(X) = set of cospans which commute with all the spans in X,
L(Y) = set of spans which commute with all the cospans in Y.

Now, a square  (x, y)  (span/cospan) commutes iff  {x} is contained
in  L({y})  iff  {y} is contained in R({x}).
A square  (x, y)  is "semicartesian" (or "exact") iff it satisfies
the stronger, equivalent conditions:

1.  R{x} = RL({y})
2.  L{y} = LR({x}).

How about "sub-pullback"?
since it is a sub-object of the pullback (if there is one).

In my previous message, one should read:

a commutative square with two parallel fibrations in a right proper
model category is a homotopy pullback if and only if the square is exact
with respect to the class of weak equivalences. These special squares
compose because weak equivalences are stable under base change along
fibrations (this is the definition of right proper).

Here's my take on this skit, as filtered through
40 years of ever-more-porous memory:

Lin Ton was Chalkfinger's "Chinese assistant."
I think the Chinese connection came about less because
I looked Chinese, as because (a) I was a somewhat
mysterious figure, doing no teaching (being a 1-year
research associate on one of Saunders' grants), and
(b) my name lent itself to Sinification.

Others spoofed here, aside from me (Lin Ton) and
Saunders (Chalkfinger) were Yitz Herstein (Israel Bond)
and Irving Kaplansky (character forgotten) -- and, I
think, Zygmund and Liulevicius.

One memorable line was Israel Bond's: furious at a magical
ring, supposedly conveying some mysterious powers, for
its uselessness to his purpose at the time, Bond dashes
it to the ground, huffing "Bah! This ring is nil!"

The skit took place towards the end of the academic year
'64-'65, all of which I spent at Chicago. Others there at
that time, surely present at -- perhaps even intimately
involved in -- the performance include Lance Small,
Kathy Edwards, Dan Fife, and my officemate Marty Moskowitz,
all of whom may well recall further details.

I once had a copy of the full script, but have no idea just
where to look to unearth it. Should it turn up, of course,
I'll try to make it available.

Thanks for these comments.

I was mainly investigating the acceptance of these terms by the categorical
community, to decide if I should change for the new edition of my old book.

I agree with Paul's comments to me personally that it is a good idea to
avoid overworked terms (like `universal').

The issue is that for a morphism f: G \to H of groupoids, the notion of
quotient introduced by Philip Higgins, namely if f is full and Ob(f) is
surjective, is fine. The other important notion is that f comes from an
identification of objects, which in Paul's terminology would be supine
(w.r.t. the opfibration Ob: Gpds \to Sets). More vivid would be H is a
0-identification of G, that is the groupoid H is then obtained from G by an
identification of objects. It would tie in with other situations to say that
H is induced from G by Ob(f).

There is a good case for not introducing new words.

On 29 Nov 2005, the Montreal Category seminar hosted a talk by
Jean-Pierre Marquis on the interaction between Kreisel's and Lawvere's views
on category theory as a foundations for mathematics.  It has been suggested
that many on this list who were not able to attend the talk might find its
contents of interest, and so would be interested to know that the slides for
the talk are available on the triples seminar webpage, at

    http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/seminar/

(scroll down to the talk itself - the direct link is

  http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/seminar/Marquis_KreiselLawvere.pdf

if you prefer).  The slides are fairly complete, and give a good idea of the
content of the talk itself.

Here is an abstract of the talk:

Jean-Pierre Marquis
Organization vs foundations: Kreisel, Lawvere and category theory

Abstract: it is well-known that in the nineteen-sixties, Bill Lawvere
proposed that category theory could serve as a foundations for
mathematics and logic.  Only one logician reacted officially: Georg
Kreisel.  In a series of notes, appendices and reviews, Kreisel
developed arguments against categorical foundations. In this talk, I
will take a close look at his arguments, examine whether they are still
convincing and propose that Kreisel's position is still underlying most
of the arguments against categorical foundations heard to this day.

Let me suggest still another terminology:

For this, call a class S of maps in an arbitrary category *(co)stable*
iff S is closed under composition and under (co)base change. Then call a
commutative square *S-exact * (resp. *S-coexact*) iff the induced map to
the pullback (resp. from the pushout) belongs to S. It is then easy to
check that S-(co)exact squares compose for any (co)stable class S (which
I believe is the minimal condition to impose on any reasonable
distinguished class of commutative squares).

In an abelian category, the class M of monos (resp. the class E of epis)
is not only stable (resp. costable) but also costable (resp. stable).
With this terminology, Hilton's exact squares can either be identified
with the E-exact squares or with the M-coexact squares, which explains
why it is a self-dual concept, cf. the first message of Michael Barr and
the last message of Marco Grandis.

In homotopy theory, there is the important concept of a *homotopy
pullback* which is the ``homotopy invariant'' substitute for an
ordinary pullback. For those who are familiar with Quillen model
categories, it is very useful in practice that if a Quillen model
category is *right proper* (i.e. its class of fibrations is stable),
then a commutative square with two parallel fibrations is a homotopy
pullback *if and only if* the square is exact with respect to the class
of trivial fibrations (those fibrations which are also weak
equivalences). There is of course a dual statement for homotopy pushouts
in a left proper Quillen model category.

With best regards,

Clemens Berger.

very good point

i suggest, since we can live with epics, strict(=regular) epis,
universal such, etc etc,

we should have:

quasi-pullback

strict(=regular) quasi pullback

universal quasi-pullback

of course, the useful concept being: "strict universal quasi-pullback"

e.d.

Dear categorists,
some of you might be interested in the following
paper, now available on arXiv
(http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0512194)
"Bipolar spaces"
Claudio Pisani

Abstract:
Some basic features of the simultaneous inclusion of
discrete fibrations and discrete opfibrations on a
category A in the category of categories over A are
studied; in particular, the reflections and the
coreflections of the latter in the former are
considered, along with a negation-complement operator
which, applied to a discrete fibration, gives a
functor with values in discrete opfibrations (and vice
versa) and which turns out to be classical, in that
the strong contraposition law holds.

Such an analysis is developed in an appropriate
conceptual frame that encompasses similar "bipolar"
situations and in which a key role is played by
"cofigures", that is components of products;
e.g. the classicity of the negation-complement operator
corresponds to the fact that discrete opfibrations (or
in general "closed parts") are properly analyzed by
cofigures with shape in discrete fibrations ("open
parts"), that is, that the latter are "coadequate" for
the former, and vice versa.

In this context, a very natural definition of "atom"
is proposed and it is shown that, in the above
situation, the category of atoms reflections is the
Cauchy completion of A.
-----------

Of course, any comment or criticism is welcome. In
particular, I would like to know which facts, apart
from the formalism, sound familiar (e.g., concerning
the coreflection in discrete fibrations).

Best regards

Claudio

Dear Categorists -

Here's the portion of "week224" that deals with category theory.

Happy Holidays to everyone!

Best,

This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics - Week 224
John Baez

This week I want to mention a couple of papers lying on the interface of
physics, topology, and higher-dimensional algebra.  But first, some
astronomy pictures... and a bit about the mathematical physicist Hamilton!

[...]

Now for some mathematical physics that touches on higher-dimensional
algebra.  If you still don't get why topological field theory and
n-categories are so cool, read this thesis:

13) Bruce H. Bartlett, Categorical aspects of topological quantum field
theories, M.Sc. Thesis, Utrecht University, 2005.  Available as
math.QA/0512103.

It's a great explanation of the big picture!  I can't wait to see what
Bartlett does for his Ph.D..

If you're a bit deeper into this stuff, you'll enjoy this:

14) Aaron D. Lauda and Hendryk Pfeiffer, Open-closed strings: two-dimensional
extended TQFTs and Frobenius algebras, available as math.AT/0510664.

This paper gives a purely algebraic description of the topology of
open and closed strings, making precise and proving some famous guesses
due to Moore and Segal, which can be seen here:

15) Greg Moore, Lectures on branes, K-theory and RR charges,
Clay Math Institute Lecture Notes (2002), available at
http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~gmoore/clay1/clay1.html

Lauda and Pfeiffer's paper makes heavy use of Frobenius algebras, developing
more deeply some of the themes I mentioned in "week174".  In a related
piece of work, Lauda has figured out how to *categorify* the concept of a
Frobenius algebra, and has applied this to 3d topology:

16) Aaron Lauda, Frobenius algebras and ambidextrous adjunctions,
available as math.CT/0502550.

Aaron Lauda, Frobenius algebras and planar open string topological field
theories, available as math.QA/0508349.

The basic idea behind all this work is a "periodic table" of categorified
Frobenius algebras, which are related to topology in different dimensions.
For example, in "week174" I explained how Frobenius algebras formalize the
idea of paint drips on a sheet of rubber.  As you move your gaze down a
sheet of rubber covered with drips of paint, you'll notice that drips can
merge:


                      \ \         / /
                       \ \       / /
                        \ \     / /
                         \ \   / /
                          \ \_/ /
                           \   /
                            | |
                            | |
                            | |
                            | |
                            | |

but also split:

                            | |
                            | |
                            | |
                            | |
                            | |
                           / _ \
                          / / \ \
                         / /   \ \
                        / /     \ \
                       / /       \ \
                      / /         \ \

In addition, drips can start:

                            _
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |

but also end:


                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           | |
                           |_|

In a Frobenius algebra, these four pictures correspond to four operations
called "multiplication" (merging), "comultiplication" (splitting), the
"unit" (starting) and the "counit" (ending).  Moreover, these operations
satisfy precisely the relations that you can prove by warping the piece
of rubber and seeing how the pictures change.  For example, there's the
associative law:

            \ \    / /    / /      \ \    \ \    / /
             \ \  / /    / /        \ \    \ \  / /
              \ \/ /    / /          \ \    \ \/ /
               \  /    / /            \ \    \  /
                \ \   / /              \ \   / /
                 \ \_/ /                \ \_/ /
                  \   /                  \   /
                   | |                    | |
                   | |                    | |
                   | |          =         | |
                   | |                    | |
                   | |                    | |
                   | |                    | |
                   | |                    | |
                   | |                    | |

The idea here is that if you draw the picture on the left-hand side on
a sheet of rubber, you can warp the rubber until it looks like the
right-hand side!  There's also the "coassociative law", which is
just an upside-down version of the above picture.   But the most
interesting laws are the "I = N" equation:

               \ \     / /                | |        | |
                \ \   / /                 | |        | |
                 \ \_/ /                  | |        | |
                  \   /                   |  \       | |
                   | |                    |   \      | |
                   | |                    | |\ \     | |
                   | |                    | | \ \    | |
                   | |                    | |  \ \   | |
                   | |          =         | |   \ \  | |
                   | |                    | |    \ \ | |
                   | |                    | |     \ \| |
                   | |                    | |      \   |
                  / _ \                   | |       \  |
                 / / \ \                  | |        | |
                / /   \ \                 | |        | |
               / /     \ \                | |        | |

and its mirror-image version.

So, the concept of Frobenius algebra captures the topology of regions
in the plane!  Aaron Lauda makes this fact into a precise theorem in
his paper on planar open string field theories, and then generalizes it
to consider "categorified" Frobenius algebras where the above equations
are replaced by isomorphisms, which describe the *process* of warping the
sheet of rubber until the left side looks like the right.  You should look
at his paper even if you don't understand the math, because it's full of
cool pictures.

Lauda and Pfeiffer's paper goes still further, by considering these paint
stripes as "open strings", not living in the plane anymore, but zipping
around in some spacetime of high dimension, where they might as well be
abstract 2-manifolds with corners.  Following Moore and Segal, they also
bring "closed strings" into the game, which form a Frobenius algebra of
their own, where the multiplication looks like an upside-down pair of pants:

    O       O
    \ \   / /
     \ \ / /
      \   /
       | |
       | |
       | |
       | |
       | |
        O

These topological closed strings are the subject of Joachim Kock's
book mentioned in "week202"; they correspond to *commutative*
Frobenius algebras.  The fun new stuff comes from letting the open
strings and closed strings interact.

You can read more about Lauda and Pfeiffer's work at Urs Schreiber's
blog:

17) Urs Schreiber, Lauda and Pfeiffer on open-closed topological strings,
http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000680.html

In fact, I recommend Schreiber's blog quite generally to anyone interested
in higher categories and/or the math of string theory!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Addendum:

Here's what Urs Schreiber had to say about Frobenius algebras, modular
tensor categories and string theory:

  John Baez wrote:

  [...] Following Moore and Segal, they also bring "closed strings"

 I would like to make the following general comment on the meaning
 of Frobenius algebras in 2-dimensional quantum field theory.

 Interestingly, _non_-commutative Frobenius algebras
 play a role even for closed strings, and even if the
 worldhseet theory is not purely topological.

 The archetypical example for this is the class of
 2D TFTs invented by Fukuma, Hosono and Kawai.  There
 one has a non-commutative Frobenius algebra which
 describes not the splitting/joining of the entire
 worldsheet, but rather the splitting/joining of
 edges in any one of its dual triangulations.  It is the
 _center_ of (the Morita class of) the noncommutative
 Frobenius algebra decorating dual triangulations
 which is the commutative Frobenius algebra describing
 the closed 2D TFT.

 One might wonder if it has any value to remember
 a non-commutative Frobenius algebra when only its center
 matters (in the closed case).  The point is that the
 details of the non-commutative Frobenius algebra acting
 in the "interior" of the world sheet affects the nature
 of "bulk field insertions" that one can consider
 and hence affects the (available notions of) n-point
 correlators of the theory, for n > 0.

 This aspect, however, is pronounced only when one
 switches from 2D topological field theories to
 conformal ones.

 The fascinating thing is that even 2D "conformal" field
 theories are governed by Frobenius algebras.  The
 difference lies in different categorical internalization.
 The Frobenius algebras relevant for CFT don't live
 in Vect, but in some other (modular) tensor category,
 usually that of representations of some chiral vertex
 operator algebra.  It is that ambient tensor category
 which "knows" if the Frobenius algebra describes a
 topological or a conformal field theory (in 2D) -
 and which one.

 Of course what I am referring to here is the work
 by Fjelstad, Froehlich, Fuchs, Runkel, Schweigert and
 others.  I can recommend their most recent review which
 will appear in the Streetfest proceedings.  It is
 available as math.CT/0512076.

 The main result is, roughly, that given any modular tensor
 category with certain properties, and given any
 (symmetric and special) Frobenius algebra object internal
 to that category, one can construct functions on surfaces
 that satisfy all the properties that one would demand of
 an n-point function of a 2D (conformal) field theory.

 If we define a field theory to be something not given by
 an ill-defined path integral, but something given by
 its set of correlation functions, then this amounts to
 constructing a (conformal) field theory.

 This result is achieved by first defining a somewhat
 involved procedure for generating certain classes of
 functions on marked surfaces, and then proving that
 the functions generated by this procedure do indeed
 satisfy all the required properties.

 In broad terms, the prescription is to choose a dual
 triangulation of the marked worldsheet whose correlation
 function is to be computed, to decorate its edges with
 symmetric special Frobenius algebra objects in some
 modular tensor category, to decorate its vertices by
 product and coproduct morphisms of this algebra, to
 embed the whole thing in a certain 3-manifold in a
 certain way and for every boundary or bulk field
 insertion to add one or two threads labeled by
 simple objects of the tensor category which connect
 edges of the chosen triangulation with the boundary of
 that 3-manifold.  Then you are to hit the resulting
 extended 3-manifold with the functor of a 3D TFT and
 hence obtain a vector in a certain vector space.  This
 vector, finally, is claimed to encode the correlation
 function.

 This procedure is deeply rooted in well-known relations
 between 3-(!)-dimensional topological field theory,
 modular functors and modular tensor categories and
 may seem very natural to people who have thought long
 enough about it.  It is already indicated in Witten's
 paper on the Jone's polynomial, that 3D TFT (Chern-Simons
 field theory in that case) computes conformal blocks
 of conformal field theories on the boundaries of these
 3-manifolds.  To others, like me in the beginning,
 it may seem like a miracle that an involved and
 superficially ad hoc procedure like this has anything
 to do with correlations functions of conformal
 field theory in the end.

 In trying to understand the deeper "meaning" of it all
 I played around with the idea that this prescription
 is really, to some extent at least, the "dual"
 incarnation of the application of a certain 2-functor
 to the worldsheet.  Namely a good part of the rough
 structure appearing here automatically drops out
 when a 2-functor applied to some 2-category of
 surfaces is "locally trivialized".  I claim that
 any local trivialization of a 2-functor on
 some sort of 2-category of surface elements gives
 rise to a dual triangulation of the surface whose
 edges are labeled by (possibly a generalization of)
 a Frobenius algebra object and whose vertices are
 labeled by (possibly a generalization of) product
 and coproduct operations.  There is more data
 in a locally trivialized 2-functor, and it seems to
 correctly reproduce the main structure of bulk field
 insertions as appearing above.  But of course there
 is a limit to what a _2_-functor can know about a
 structure that is inherently 3-dimensional.

 I have begun outlining some of the details that I
 have in mind here:

 http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000697.html

 This has grown out of a description of gerbes with
 connective structure in terms of transport 2-functors.
 Note that in what is called a _bundle_ gerbe we also
 do have a certain product operation playing a
 decisive role.  Bundle gerbes can be understood as
 "pre-trivializations" of 2-functors to Vect:

 http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000686.html

 and the product appearing is one of the Frobenius
 products mentioned above.  For a bundle gerbe the
 coproduct is simply the inverse of the product,
 since this happens to be an isomorphism. The claim
 is that 2-functors to Vect more generally give rise
 to non-trivial Frobenius algebras when locally
 trivialized.

 This is work in progress and will need to be refined.
 I thought I'd mention it here as a comment to John's
 general statements about how Frobenius algebras know
 about 2-dimensional physics.  I am grateful for all
 kinds of comments.

 Here's the paper Urs refers to:

Topological and conformal field theory as Frobenius algebras, available
as math.CT/0512076.

The earliest written testemony I know of is in Seminaire Bourbaki, 19=
61:

  A. Grothendieck, Technique de descente et theoremes d'existence en=
=20
  geometrie algebrique, III: Preschemas quotients.  Seminaire Bourbak=
i=20
  t.12, 1960/61, exp. 212.

In Section 4, categories are characterised as presheaves on Delta tha=
t
take amalgamated sums over [0] to fibre products.  (Delta =3D skeleto=
n of
finite non-empty ordinals).  Groupoids are characterised as presheave=
s on
Phi taking amalgamated sums to fibre products, where Phi is the symme=
tric
version of Delta, i.e. skeleton for non-empty phinite sets and any ma=
ps.
(Delta and Phi are not Grothendieck's notation.)

Also the terminology 'nerve of a category' is usually attributed to
Grothendieck, but it is actually not used in the above Expose'.
(Of course, 'nerve of a covering' goes much further back -- I think t=
o=20
Cech in the 1930s.)

The details probably should have been in SGA1 expose' VII (which was =
never
written), and appeared instead in Section 2 of J. Giraud, Methode de =
la
descente, Bull. Soc. Math. France Mem., 1964.  (Giraud was supposed t=
o
write Expose' VII, but the manuscript got longer and longer, less and=
=20
less geometric, and was delayed for these reasons, and finally he dec=
ided=20
to publish it separately instead.  (He says something like this in th=

introduction to the long memoir.))

The 2006 edition of AMAST (Algebraic Methodology and Software Technology)
has been scheduled to follow CT'06 so that travelling category theorists
with an interest in computer science have time to proceed from Nova Scotia
to Estonia.

AMAST in the past has had some excelent category theoretic papers, and
if you're interested in submitting, the call for papers is below.

Best (and festive!) wishes, Mike.

--------------------------



                          CALL FOR PAPERS

                 11th International Conference on
      Algebraic Methodology and Software Technology, AMAST '06

                       colocated with MPC '06

                Kuressaare, Estonia,  5-8 July 2006


                http://cs.ioc.ee/mpc-amast06/amast/



Background

The major goal of the AMAST conferences is to promote research that
may lead to the setting of software technology on a firm, mathematical
basis. This goal is advanced by a large international cooperation with
contributions from both academia and industry. The virtues of a
software technology developed on a mathematical basis have been
envisioned as being capable of providing software that is (a) correct,
and the correctness can be proved mathematically, (b) safe, so that it
can be used in the implementation of critical systems, (c) portable,
i.e., independent of computing platforms and language generations, and
(d) evolutionary, i.e., it is self-adaptable and evolves with the
problem domain.

The previous conferences were held in Iowa City, Iowa, USA (1989, 1991
and 2000), Twente, The Netherlands (1993), Montreal, Canada (1995),
Munich, Germany (1996), Sydney, Australia (1997), Manaus, Amazonia,
Brazil (1998), Reunion Island, France (2002) and Stirling, UK (2004,
colocated with MPC' 04). The 2006 conference will be held at
Kuressaare, Estonia, colocated with MPC '06.

The conference series has become widely known for disseminating
academic and industrial achievements within the broad AMAST areas
of interest. Through these meetings AMAST has attracted an international
following among researchers and practitioners interested in software
technology, programming methodology and their algebraic and logical
foundations.

work and not be submitted concurrently to another conference with
refereed proceedings. Accepted papers must be presented at the
conference by one of the authors.

All papers will be refereed by the programme committee, and will be
judged based on their significance, technical merit, and relevance
to the conference.


Publication

As in the past the proceedings of AMAST '06 will be published in the
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series of Springer-Verlag.

In the past the best papers from AMAST have been published in a
special issue of the journal Theoretical Computer Science and it
is expected that this practice will be continued for AMAST '06.

I have seen in this mail that the suggestion of Taylor and Johnstone to
replace cartesian and cocartesian maps by prone and supine ones begins to
be accepted. When I first saw that suggestion, I was so amazed that I
thought it was a joke, and not such a good one. I still hope it is no more
than that. But, just in case, and before it is too late, I want to say
that I am very strongly opposed to such changes for many reasons:
linguistic, mathematical, and ethical, which I am ready to explain in
detail if I am asked to do so.

It's funny, but exactly that question of terminology
(prone, supine, etc) came up a few weeks ago in some
joint work with a student here.  I made the same case
to him, almost exactly, that Jean Benabou just made.
And one other objection: I'd like category theory no
longer to be regarded as nonsense in this country ---
it still is in many quarters, as I could easily prove ---
and such terminology is not exactly helpful to the cause!

Peter May

ps: Then again, I don't much like using the overused
words cartesian and cocartesian.

First Call for Papers:

         Structural Operational Semantics 2006

         A Satellite Workshop of CONCUR 2006

         August 26, 2006, Bonn, Germany

         http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~rvg/SOS2006

Aim: Structural operational semantics (SOS) provides a framework
for giving operational semantics to programming and specification
languages. A growing number of programming languages from
commercial and academic spheres have been given usable semantic
descriptions by means of structural operational semantics. Because
of its intuitive appeal and flexibility, structural operational
semantics has found considerable application in the study of the
semantics of concurrent processes. Moreover, it is becoming a
viable alternative to denotational semantics in the static analysis
of programs, and in proving compiler correctness.

Recently, structural operational semantics has been successfully
applied as a formal tool to establish results that hold for classes
of process description languages. This has allowed for the
generalisation of well-known results in the field of process
algebra, and for the development of a meta-theory for process
calculi based on the realization that many of the results in this
field only depend upon general semantic properties of language
constructs.

This workshop aims at being a forum for researchers, students and
practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for
future investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics.
One of the specific goals of the workshop is to establish synergies
between the concurrency and programming language communities working
on the theory and practice of SOS. Moreover, it aims at widening the
knowledge of SOS among postgraduate students and young researchers
worldwide.

Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

  * programming languages
  * process algebras
  * higher-order formalisms
  * rule formats for operational specifications
  * meaning of operational specifications
  * comparisons between denotational, axiomatic and SOS
  * compositionality of modal logics with respect to
    operational specifications
  * congruence with respect to behavioural equivalences
  * conservative extensions
  * derivation of proof rules from operational specifications
  * software tools that automate, or are based on, SOS.

Papers reporting on applications of SOS to software engineering and
other areas of computer science are welcome.

History: The first SOS Workshop took place in August 2004 in London
as one of the satellite workshops of CONCUR 2004, and was attended
by over 30 participants [http://www.cs.aau.dk/~luca/SOS-WORKSHOP/].
The second SOS Workshop occurred in July 2005 in Lisbon as a
satellite workshop of ICALP 2005, and attracted 19 submissions
[http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/SOS2005/].


INVITED SPEAKERS:

  * Robin Milner (Cambridge, UK; joint invited speaker with EXPRESS 2006)

  * Bartek Klin (Sussex, UK)

I very strongly agree with J. Benabou's comments about "prone" and
"supine", and P. May's opinion that "I'd like category theory no longer to
be regarded as nonsense in this country --- it still is in many quarters,
as I could easily prove --- and such terminology is not exactly helpful to
the cause!"

I recall P. Johnstone that he himself named his book  "Elephant Book"
because every body has different version of what a topos is, reflecting
only one of the many aspects of the concept.

Names like "Prone" and "Supine" correspond (with luck) to only one of the
many aspects of the concept of cartesian and its dual (in a sense)
cocartesian.

Also, there is a clear ethical aspect involved when a stablished
terminology that has been historically introduced by particular people
suffers a move to be eliminated and reeplaced by another.

But, coming back to the question above, i am also against the habit to
name a new mathematical concept with words that have a precise meaning in
everyday language (as prone, supine, etc).

Presisely, I do not know what does it mean exactly "Cartesian" (has
something to do with Descartes ...), but I know presisely what it is a
"Cartesian arrow" (in mathematics).

Colorful terminology taken from everyday language is an strong indication
to serious mathematicians that the subject should no be taken seriously
(see for example the claims of  "Catastrofe Theory" as opposed to the
sober "Classification of singularities of C-\infty mappings", and a lot of
similar examples).

As P May points out, "  . . .  such terminology is not exactly helpful to
the cause!".

The meaning of a mathematical concept should be given by the concept
itself, and not by the connotation that its name has in everyday language.

For the revision of my old topology book, I  want to keep the analogies
which the fibrations of categories concept brings out very well - I am
coming (very late!) to the view that this is an important part of
`categories for the working mathematician' (the concept, not necessarily the
book).

In the general topology part of the book, I have final topologies with
respect to a function, and also identification maps, as in Bourbaki.

So (unless anyone can quickly come with anything better) I have decided on
replacing

(a) `universal morphism of groupoids f: G \to H'

as in the current text and Philip Higgins' book, and which uses an overused
word `universal', by

(a') ` f gives H  the final structure with respect to G and Ob(f)'

(b) `under these circumstances, f is a 0-identification morphism if also
Ob(f) is surjective'.

I initially (!) wanted to say `f is a 0-final morphism' instead of  (a') but
Tim pointed out it was initial in an appropriate category!

Another possibility is `H has the induced structure w.r.t Ob(f)', and to use
the res/ind terminology from representation theory and Mackey functors.

Comments on these issues welcome. But the aim is to use terminology which
has associations and emphasises analogies.

The new title will be `Topology and groupoids', which seems better to
reflect the content. It will (all being well) be available as a print and
ebook, with the ebook in color and hyper-reference.

To add to my previous email, I'd like reactions to the following
terminology:

Let P: X \to B be a functor. A morphism u: x \to y in X is  cofinal w.r.t.
P, and y is the P-final object w,r,t u and P , if ... (and here we have the
usual notion of cocartesian).

Dually,  u is coinitial, and x is the initial object w.r.t   u and P if ...
(and here we have the usual notion of cartesian).

In situations where P is understood, we can then talk about cofinal and
coinitial morphisms, and structures or objects or (in my case, groupoids).

An advantage is that the direction of the notion and its dual should be
clear.

If f=P(u), I would then write \bar{f}: x \to f_*(x) in the first case, and
\underline{f}: f^*(y) \to y in the second. I would also call f_*(x) the
object induced by f.  What is a handy name for f^*(y)? The restriction of y
by f?

All these notions occur for modules, crossed modules, ...... and relate to
change of base.

I would be grateful for getting the earliest reference to the fact
that for two small categories T and S the corresponding
functor-categories into Set are equivalent iff  T and S have the same
idempotent (= Cauchy) completion. One can find this in a russian paper:

The result appears in my 1966 thesis ("Categories of Set-valued functors",
U. of Pennsylvania), and in print (with an arbitrary closed category base V
and categories relative to V) in the following 1969 paper, translated into
Russian in 1972.

Jiri asks:

  I would be grateful for getting the earliest reference to the fact
  that for two small categories T and S the corresponding functor-
  categories into Set are equivalent iff T and S have the same
  idempotent (= Cauchy) completion.

The fact that a category and its idempotent completion have equivalent
functor categories was certainly known very early. It does not appear
in the first book on category theory (1964) but the lemma that proves
it, to wit, that idempotent-complete cats form a full reflective
subcategory of the relevant category (COSCANECOF) appears on page 61
(which is 18 pages before any mention of reflective subcats and 48
pages before the first mention of functor categories -- see
www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/3/).

That book was devoted to the additive setting. On page 119 one finds
the additive notion, "amenable", corresponding to the condition of
idempotents splitting. The full subcat of small projectives in the
functor category in the additive setting is dual to the amenable
closure of the domain category -- thus providing an instant proof that
if two cats have equivalent additive functor categories then their
amenable closures are equivalent. The non-additive case is easier: the
full subcat of indecomposable projectives in the category of set-
valued functos is dual to the idempotent completion of the domain
category.

Concerning  Ronnie wanderings about terminology around the word  FINAL,
the following is pertinent:

I am just writing a paper with Luis Espannol where we need to develop (the
basic part of the theory of cartesian and cocartesian arrows) for families

we use the following terminology:

consider a functor  U: C ---> S, then:

1)  a family in C              Z _i ---> X

over                           R_i --->  S   is    FINAL   iff:

given   S ---> T = UY  such that there exists   Z_i --->Y   over
R_i ---> S ---> T (that is,  R_i ---> S ---> T lifts), then there exists a
unique   X ---> Y over   S ---> T (that is,  S ---> T lifts).

For topological spaces this is the usual Bourbaki notion of final
topology.

When U is not understood, we call this  "U-FINAL"

Notice that for single arrows, we have (proved in the SGA on fibered
categories)

            Z ---> X is final     iff            it is cocartesian
                                          and cocartesian  arrows compose



2)  a family in C            Z _i ---> X

over                         R_i --->  S  is  SURJECTIVE   iff:

the family  R_i --->  S  is an strict (or regular) epimorphic family in S


Our aim is to prove under some natural and minimal assumptions:

  Z _i ---> X   is  strict epimorphic     iff    it is  final  surjective

All this is already done

Here the leading examples are the topological spaces  and  the
quasitopological spaces in the sense of Spanier  (and the whole theory of
concrete quasitopoi over S = Sets)

Without taking sides on the prone/supine terminology question, I do have
a strong reaction to the Benabou/May/Dubuc concern that respect for a
field is undermined by its adoption of frivolous terminology.

This may be a valid concern for a young field like category theory, but
for a more mature subject such as physics, a more relevant concern is
the undermining of the ability to poke fun at oneself by the fear of not
being taken seriously.

Has the adoption of frivolous nomenclature for quarks ("strange,"
"charm," "beauty" and even "quark" itself) diminished in any way the
world's respect for quarks and their investigators?

And what of computational topology?  Should we turn a blind eye to
whether Scott is sober, and substitute a more genteel euphemism for his
bottom?

There indeed are drawbacks whenever scientific terms are contrary to the
centuries old tradition not taken from Greek or Latin languages (that,
thanks to their very regular and flexible system of word formation are
so suitable for taxonomies) shared by many cultures. For one thing,
words of existing languages are not in one to one mapping, and then a
term from contemporary language may be not culturally neutral (consider
silly naming wars for transuranium elements).

On the other hand, I stopped using "co-product" after more than one
person with the background in classical languages read it as
"copro-duct".

In a previous mail I said that I was strongly opposed to the=20
replacement of "cartesian" and "co-cartesian" maps by "prone" and=20
"supine" ones for linguistic, mathematical and ethical reasons which I=20=

was ready to explain in detail if I was asked to do so.
I have waited a few days to see what reactions I  would get. So far, my=20=

position has been supported by Peter May and Eduardo Dubuc on ethical=20
and/or linguistic grounds, and Keith Harbaugh has asked me what=20
"ethical"  issue is involved, and more generally to clarify my position=20=

on the mailing list.

Although the ethical issues are for me the most important, I shall=20
postpone them to another mail, if the moderator of this list permits me=20=

to do so, and I shall concentrate to-day on the mathematical an=20
linguistic reasons of my opposition.
I am no linguist, but I am a mathematician, so THE MATHEMATICS WILL=20
COME FIRST, and I would like to make this  text more "palatable" and=20
less "negative" by introducing some genuinely new ideas, which some of=20=

you might find of interest, and which are relevant in this debate.

=A71- DEFINITIONS

Let  P: C ---> B  be a a functor.
1.1-  A map v of C is VERTICAL (forP)   if  P(v) is an identity. I=20
denote by  V(P) or simply V the subcategory of  C which has the same=20
objects as C and as maps the vertical ones.
Every identity is vertical, and if in a commutative triangle in C two=20
of the maps are vertical so is the third.

1.2- Let f be a map f of C. We shall say that f  is :
(i)  CARTESIAN if for every pair (g,b) with g in C , b in B,  and=20
P(g)=3DP(f).b there exists a unique map h in C such that:   P(h)=3Db  =
and =20
g=3Df.h.
(ii)  PRECARTESIAN If the previous condition is satisfied only when b=20
is an identity,
(iii)  HORIZONTAL if every vertical map is orthogonal to f . (that=20
would probably be "prone" in the proposed new terminology)
I shall denote by  K(P), PreK(P) and H(P) the classes of maps of C=20
which are cartesian, precartesian and horizontal, and abbreviate by K,=20=

PreK,  and H  if  P  is fixed.


1.3 - The functor P is a fibration (resp. a PREFIBRATION)  if for every=20=

pair (b,X) where b is a map of B, and X an object of C and=20
P(X)=3DCodom(b)  there exists a cartesian (resp.precartesian) map f: Y=20=

--->X  such that  P(f)=3Db


1.4 - If X is an object of C and  b: J--->P(X)  we denote Pl(b,X) the=20
category of  P-LIFTINGS of b with codomain X with objects the maps f:=20
Y--->X  of C such that  P(f)=3Db, a morphism from f to f': Y'--->X  is a=20=

vertical map  v: Y--->Y'  such that  f.v=3Df' .
I shall say that P is a HOMOTOPY PREFIBRATION if all the categories =20
Pl(b,X) are connected (which of course imply non empty), the motivation=20=

of the name is that any two liftings are "homotopic".

1.5 - Let  P: C --->  B  and  P': C' ---> B  be two functors and  F; C=20=

---> C'  be a functor over B i.e. such that P'.F=3DP. Such an F =
obviously=20
preserves and reflects vertical maps for P and P'. Moreover if f: Y=20
--->X is in Pl(b,X) , F(f): F(Y) ---> F(X) is in P'l(b,F(X))  hence F=20
induces functors
           Fl(b,X): Pl(b,X) --->P'l(b,F(X)) , f  l--->F(f)  , for all=20
"compatible" pairs (b,X)
I shall say that F is a CARTESIAN FUNCTOR if all the functors Fl(b,X)=20
are final. (No assumption is made on  P  or P').

=A72-REMARKS "EN VRAC" ABOUT THESE DEFINITIONS (or, let's do a little =
bit=20
of mathematics!)

2.1- Let P: C --->B be a functor  (we assume NOTHING on P) Then:
(i) Every cartesian map is horizontal i.e. K(P) is contained in H(P).
The converse need not be true, for example if all vertical maps are=20
iso's i.e. all the fibers of P are groupo=EFds, then all maps of C are=20=

horizontal, and "co-horizontal" And one can construct a P where C and B=20=

are finite posets where no map, except of course the identities, is=20
pre-cartesian or pre-cocartesian, let alone cartesian or cocartesian
(ii) THEOREM. If P is a homotopy- prefibration, then cartesian=20
coincides with horizontal, i.e.  H(P)=3DK(p).
(It is not completely trivial)

The definitions 1.4 and 1.5 are genuinely new, and might seem=20
surprising, the following remarks will give a very small idea of what=20
can be done with them

2.2- A cartesian functor preserves precartesian maps :
Because f: Y --->X is in  PreK(P)  iff it is a final object of =20
Pl(P(f),X) , and final functors preserve final objects

However if P and P' are are arbitrary functors such a preservation is=20
not enough to insure that F is cartesian because there might not be=20
"enough" precartesian maps in C. But cartesian functors have so far=20
NEVER been used except between prefibrations, and in that  case our=20
definition coincides with the usual one because we have:

2.3- If P and P' are prefibrations,  F  is cartesian iff  it preserves=20=

precartesian maps.(It suffices in fact that P is a prefibration)

I like to make the following "analogy" : if  S and T are topological=20
spaces a continuous function  f: S --->T preserves convergent=20
sequences, if X is metrisable, this is enough to insure the continuity=20=

of f

2.4 - Cartesian functors are closed under composition, and every=20
equivalence over B is cartesian.
In fact we have much better, namely.

2.5 - If a functor F over B has a left adjoint then F is cartesian

2.6 - Homotopy-prefibrations are stable by composition.
This seems "harmless" and trivial, but it is neither. It is well known=20=

that fibrations are stable by composition, but it is probably a little=20=

less well known, because I have never seen a statement to that effect,=20=

that prefibrations  ARE NOT .

2.7 - Homotopy-prefibrations  (h-p) are special cases of cartesian=20
functors, because P. C --->B  is a h-p iiff it is a cartesian functor:=20=

(C,P) --->(B,IdB).
(This of course is no longer true if h-p is replaced by prefibration or=20=

fibration)
 =46rom this it follows that if  F:(C,P) --->(C',P') is cartesian and  =
P'=20
is a h-p so is  P.

2.8 - An important feature of h-p is that pointwise Kan extensions=20
along such P's can be computed fiberwise. Moreover this property=20
characterizes h-p' s.
In particular such a P is final iff all its fibers are connected, and=20
it is flat iff  it's fibers are cofiltered.
The previous results are special cases of properties true for arbitrary=20=

cartesian functors.


2.9 - REMARK : Homotopy prefibrations are but ONE example of =20
MEANINGFUL generalizations of fibrations. I have considered many=20
others, all with important mathematical examples, here are some: (for a=20=

functor  P: C --->B)
(i) The categories Pl(b,X) are filtered
(ii) Each connected component of such a category has a final object
(iii)  Each connected component is filtered
In (ii) and (ii)  P is not even a homotopy prefibration, but in all=20
these cases the general definition of cartesian functor given in 1.5 =20
is the "correct" one and gives the expected results.


=A73 LINGUISTICO-MATHEMATICAL REMARKS

3.1 - OK, let us try "prone" for "cartesian", what about the=20
precartesian maps, "preprone" ? They have nothing to do with a=20
weakening of orthogonality to V(P), which we shall examine in 3.3. What=20=

about cartesian functors, "prone functors"? What about maps which are=20
both cartesian and cocartesian, such that e.g. the iso's, prone and=20
supine? A very uncomfortable position you'll grant me. I am no acrobat,=20=

I tried it, I hurt my back and stomach, had to stand up, and ended=20
up...vertical!

3.2 - The proposed terminology is based ON A BIG MATHEMATICAL MISTAKE,=20=

namely: confusing cartesian and horizontal, which in general do NOT=20
coincide, as shown in 2.1. Unless of course there no other functors but=20=

fibrations, or if there are, the terminology should not be compatible=20
with them. Well I, and probably other persons, think that there are,=20
know that there are, and that they deserve to be studied, were it only=20=

to have a better understanding of fibrations. In 2.9 I gave a few=20
examples of such functors. If there were ONLY fibrations,  how would=20
one express the fact that a prefibration where all the fibers are=20
groupoids is a fibration?

3.3 - Even for fibrations there are interesting maps which are neither=20=

vertical nor cartesian and that one might want to study. Let me give an=20=

example. Both cartesianness and horizontality assume the existence and=20=

uniqueness of maps satisfying certain conditions. What about those=20
where we drop existence and keep uniqueness.
Following Peter Freyd's suggestion, let me call them=20
quasi-cartesian(QK), and quasi-horizontal(QH),and see what they are. A=20=

map f: Y --->X  is  QK  (rep. QH) iff  for every  parallel pair =20
(g,g'): Z=3D=3D=3D>Y  coequalized by f, if P(g)=3DP(g') (resp.if =
g.v=3Dg'.v for=20
some vertical map v) then g=3Dg'
Even in the case of fibrations, where K=3DH, QK is only contained in QH=20=

but not equal.This can be seen in the most trivial case, where B=3D1, =
and=20
all maps are vertical. A map f is QK iff it is a mono, it is QH iff =20
for every pair of maps (g,g')  WHICH CAN BE EQUALIZED,  fg=3Dfg' implies =
=20
g=3Dg'.
Now if cartesian=3Dprone, QK will have to be "quasi-prone", a strange=20
position again, but never mind. However, how should we call QH ?

3.4- I can speak, read, and write a little bit of English, but I am=20
French and might someday have the preposterous idea to lecture on=20
fibered categories in French.  Of course only in France, and to an=20
audience uniquely composed of french persons. Perhaps MM Taylor and=20
Johnstone, could suggest adequate french translations for prone and=20
supine, which I can't  seem to find. And they should be ready to do the=20=

same thing for German, Italian, Spanish, and many other languages.

No such problems with cartesian of course, because cartesian.... is=20
cartesian  is cartesian is cartesian!

3.5- By now many thousands of pages have been written in various=20
languages using "cartesian", and many hundreds are being prepared, or=20
ready to be published, using the same word. What should be done with=20
all that past or future rubbish, now that we have received THE LIGHT=20
and the WORD(S)?


=A74 TEMPORARY CONCLUSION

I apologize for such a long mail, but I wanted also to show, among=20
other things , that it is possible to handle new and relevant=20
mathematical notions by introducing a SINGLE new word, namely;=20
"homotopy prefibration" , which has a  clear intuitive content, and=20
moreover is easy to translate in most languages.

I have given many arguments to explain my position, and I have many=20
more. But for the moment, I'd like to know the arguments of the persons=20=

in favor of these changes, PRINCIPALLY, of course, those of Paul Taylor=20=

and Peter Johnstone. If it is only the "joke" aspect, I  want to add=20
that I do also like jokes, very much, perhaps not the same as theirs..=20=

I even used to compete with Sammy, who was an expert, about who'd know=20=

some jokes the other didn't.

When this mail was almost completely finished, I found the reaction of=20=

Vaughan Pratt from which I quote:

  "Has the adoption of frivolous nomenclature for quarks ("strange,"
"charm," "beauty" and even "quark" itself) diminished in any way the
world's respect for quarks and their investigators?"

I want to be clear on that matter. I have no objection to "frivolous"=20
naming of NEW concepts by the person or persons who DISCOVERED or=20
INVENTED them. But I object VERY STRONGLY to "renaming" well=20
established concepts, used for more than 40 years by the mathematical=20
community, even if the new names were NOT frivolous, and especially if=20=

such a renaming is made by persons who have made no MAJOR
contribution to the development of the field of FIBERED CATEGORIES.

As a side remark, I have no problem whatsoever to translate in French :=20=

"strange", "charm", "beauty", "quark", "sober" or "bottom". And to be=20
"frivolous", even if it's not so easy in a foreign language,=20
"homotopy's bottom" came ages before Scott's, and "Galois connection"=20
ages before the "french" one.

Since my english is not too good, in particular I knew only "the other"=20=

meaning of "supine",  I'll borrow, a bit freely, from "a good author" I=20=

admire a lot, and remind that:

                Men gave names to many animals
                In the beginning, in the beginning
                Men gave names to many animals
                In the beginning, long time ago.


Best wishes to all, Jean

We should not put everything in the same bag !!

"strange," "charm," "beauty" and even "quark" itself

are beautiful  and poetic names  to refer to objects or concepts which
precisely we do not want to associate any precise meaning in everyday
language, and on the other hand, the objects or concepts are  introduced
whith those names.

"prone/supine"  are all the contrary, they intent to reflect in everyday
language just one aspect of an existing concept which has many, and more
important, they are used in place of a well stablished name.

all this has nothing to do with  "young field" as opposed to "mature
subject"

silly names (if any) in physics would be as bad as in any other subject

do not confuse  things, I found  the  "Scott is sober" an exelent example
of humor that does not undermine respect for the field. Another exelent
example that comes to my mind is M. Barr's "The point of the empty set"

Dear Vaughan, as everybody has a say. Just my views.
I prefer some nomenclature that sounds mathematical,
rather than based on the name of a friend or a private joke.
(may be i don't understand all the jokes ?)
Also in any case one should avoid  renaming existing
concepts, that is just not fair.


Good opportunity to wish happy new year to everybody.

I will second Jean's remarks excerpted above, with a sole exception:  I
have no objection to
the renaming of a well-established concept in honor of the person(s)

first made its importance clear).

Best wishes to all for the new year,
