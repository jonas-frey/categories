        CATEGORY THEORY OCTOBERFEST: FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT
                  McGill University, Montreal
              Saturday-Sunday, October 14-15, 1995


Dear Colleague,

Once again this October the Category Theory Research Center will sponsor
a weekend meeting at McGill University.  This annual event brings
together mathematicians interested in the categorical aspects of logic,
computer science, combinatorics, universal algebra, homological algebra,
topology, analysis, and theoretical physics.

If you wish to speak, please contact Michael Barr as soon as possible.
We particularly wish to encourage advanced students and new PhDs to
use this forum to disseminate their work.  The final schedule of talks be
drawn up the morning of Oct 14.

This being the era of fiscal responsibility, there will be a registration fee
of $40 for faculty, $20 for students.  As well, the university bureaucracy
insists that we have a firm list of participants before the meeting, so
please let us know if you intend to join us by sending a short email to
fox@triples.math.mcgill.ca.

Below you will find a list of hotels and tourist rooms close to McGill.
If you have any further questions, please contact Tom Fox.

Subject: separate continuity 

Date: Fri, 4 Aug 95 15:32:33 EDT
From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

Does anyone know anything about topological spaces for which
the topological spaces for which the topology of separate
continuity on their square coincides with the product topology?
No non-discrete T_1 topology is possible; any order topology
has the property and we have at least one other space and that 
about exhausts our knowledge of the subject.

Subject: Re: separate continuity 

Date: Mon, 14 Aug 95 19:58:55 +0200
From: Reinhold Heckmann <heckmann@cs.uni-sb.de>

Concerning the question
"Which are the spaces X such that the topology of separate continuity
on X x X coincides with the product topology?"
I know of the following result:
for a T0-space X, the following are equivalent:
1) for every T0-space Y,
   the topology of separate continuity coincides with the product topology
   on X x Y,
2) whenever a point x of X is in an open set U of X,
   there are a finite set F and an open set V of X
   such that   x  in  V  subset  up F  subset  U.
   Here, up F  is
   { b in X | b is above some a in F in the specialization preorder }.

To prove 1 => 2, let Y be the space of open sets of X,
where the topology is generated by assuming all neighborhood filters
of points of X as open.

Every continuous dcpo with its Scott topology satisfies condition (2)
with F being a singleton.
There are non-continuous dcpo's which also do;
called quasi- or multi-continuous by some authors.
With T1, up F = F holds.  Thus, the only T1-spaces satisfying (2)
are the discrete spaces.

The above condition (2) probably is only sufficient,
but not necessary for the special case of X x X.
Hence, this is only a partial answer to the original question.

Subject: update to (and correction of) Complexity Doctrines (

Date: Sun, 20 Aug 95 20:39:50 EDT
From: James Otto <otto@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

Dear People,

The following update to (and correction of) my thesis, Complexity
Doctrines, is also linked to (either of)

ftp://triples.math.mcgill.ca/ctrc.html
ftp://triples.math.mcgill.ca/pub/otto/otto.html

Regards, Jim Otto

Update to Complexity Doctrines
J. Otto
August 20, 1995

In this note we

1.  point out an (annoying) error (of ours) in background material on
G"odel's system T, and thus pose an question,

2.  improve the definition of tier 0,

3.  improve the definition (and name) of sketches theories,

4.  reduce presheaves to (Makkai) sketches, and

5.  propose a definition of resolutions.

We thus update the June 13, 1995 version of Complexity Doctrines.
That version is currently linked to

  ftp://triples.math.mcgill.ca/pub/otto/otto.html

By the way, Springer LNCS 953 contains a slightly earlier (with an X
which clearly should be a 1) and abridged version of Chapter 2 of
Complexity Doctrines.

1.  System T

We consider NNO (= natural numbers objects) in SMC (=symmetric
monoidal closed) and CC (= cartesian closed) categories.  Write (as
this is not TeX) * for tensor and I for the unit.  Define -o by _ * X
-| X -o _.  Write S for the category of SMC categories having NNO and
of functors preserving chosen structure, and T for the category of CC
categories having NNO and of functors preserving chosen structure.
With J and K initial categories in S and T and with standard structure
on set (the category of small sets), we have the (unique) S and T
functors j : J --> set and k : K --> set.

Statement 5 of Proposition 1.2.4.1 claims (which we now doubt) that j
and k represent the same numeric functions (= functions between finite
powers of N).  The purported proof of Statement 5 fails (as we finally
saw after kind remarks by P. Scott at the 1995 Category Theory and
Computer Science meeting) as while the diagonal diag : N --> N * N is
definable in J [Par'e Rom'an], it is doubtful that e.g. the diagonal
diag : N -o N --> (N -o) * (N -o N) is definable in J.

As both j and k represent the primitive recursive numeric functions,
they both represent Turing machines modulo how long the machines run.
Thus which numeric functions j and k represent is a matter of how fast
such functions can grow.  It is known [Rose, Subrecursion] that the
(set of) numeric functions represented by k is the extended
Grzegorczyk hierarchy below epsilon_0.  At least a naive attempt to
obtain such growth of numeric functions represented by j fails.  In J
we can define, by commuting diagrams,

        0 * N       s * N
  I * N ----> N * N ----> N * N
    |           |           |
    | l_N       | +         | +
    v           v           v
    N --------> N --------> N

  e_2 = + diag

      0         s
  I ------> N ------> N
  |         |         |
  | id      | e_n+1   | e_n+1
  v         v         v
  I ------> N ------> N
     s 0       e_n

Now we would like to diagonalize the e_n to get beyond primitive
recursion.  But this may be undefinable in J.  However in K, by using
diag : N -o N --> (N -o N) * (N -o N) and now writing _ x X -| X => _
and 1 rather than _ * X -| X -o _ and I, we can define

               0 x (N => N)         s x (N => N)
  1 x (N => N) ------> N x (N => N) ------> N x (N => N)
       |                    |                    |
       | p_1                | p_1, '             | p_1, '
       v                    v                    v
     N => N ---------> (N => N) x N ------> (N => N) x N
            id, s 0 !               p_0, @

      0           s
  1 ------> N --------> N
  |         |           |
  | id      | f         | f
  v         v           v
  1 ----> N => N ---> N => N
     f_2          "

Here _ x X -| X => _ defines @ : (X => Y) x X --> Y terminal in the
comma category (_ x X)/Y and

  e_2 : N --> N
  ------------------
  f_2 : 1 --> N => N

  ' : N x (N => N) --> N
  -------------------------
  " : (N => N) --> (N => N)

  e : N x N --> N
  ----------------
  f : N --> N => N

Further ! is the unique map to 1.  Then we can diagonalize: e diag.

Thus we pose the question

  Which numeric functions are represented by j?

2.  Tier 0

Tier 0 can be defined as the pseudo-equalizer (aka iso-inserter) of

     T
  C ----> C
    ---->
    I !

(with I ! taking objects to the unit I and maps to the identity on I).

3.  Sketches Theories

Sketches theories, formerly sketch theories, are theories of (Makkai
rather than Ehresmann) sketches.

Definition.  With a a cardinal, an a-sketches theory is a category S
such that

1.  S is small,

2.  S is well-founded, and

3.  S has fan-out < a.

Here that S is well-founded is that for all S objects X all chains of
composable non-identity maps starting from X

  X --> --> ...

have finite length.  Note that well-founded implies acyclic (aka
1-way) and skeletal.  Further, S having fan-out < a is that for all S
objects X the cardinality of the set (indeed, cone) of maps starting
from X is < a.  We are mainly interested in the finitary case, which
is when a is countable.

4.  Reducing Presheaves to (Makkai) Sketches.

[Ad'amek Rosick'y] elegantly present the accessible categories, in
various classes, as the full subcategories in categories of presheaves
set^C of the objects [cone] (orthogonal | injective) relative to small
sets A of (cones | maps).  We reduce, by orthogonality, the categories
of presheaves set^C to categories of a-sketches set^S.

Proposition.  Given a small category C there is a 4-sketches theory S
and a (small) set A of finitely presentable set^S maps such that set^C
is equivalent to the full subcategory in set^S of objects orthogonal
to A.

Proof.  As S objects, take the objects and maps of C.  As non-identity
S maps, indexed by the C maps f : X --> Y, take the (formal) maps c_f
: f --> Y, d_f : f --> X.  Define a functor G : S --> C by c_f |-> f,
d_f |-> id_X.  Then G^* : set^C --> set^S by F |-> F G is faithful
full.  We recover the image of G^*, up to equivalence, by defining A
through the following 3 schemes (using notation as in Complexity
Doctrines).  For C maps f : X --> Y

  {! i_f x : f  d_f i_f x = x : X  [x : X]}

For C identity maps j : X --> X

  {c_j a = d_j a : X  [a : j]}

For C compositions

         h
    ------------>
  X ----> Y ----> Z
     f       g

  {c_h c = c_g b : Z
   [d_h c = d_f a : X  c_f a = d_g b : Y  a : f  b: g  c : h]}

QED

5.  Resolutions

Consider a finitary sketches theory S and a (small) set A of finitely
presentable maps in set^S.  Again (as in [Ad'amek Rosick'y]) reduce
orthogonality to injectivity.  (Thus, for non-epi maps a in A, add to
A the a^* : P --> X induced by the push-out of a along a:

      a                a
    ------>          ------>
  |         |      |         |
  | a       |      | a       | id
  v      po v      v         v
    ------> P        ------> X

.)  Roughly following [Makkai], define deductions d as compositions of
push-outs (in set^S) of maps a (thought of as axioms) in A.

We propose defining resolutions as cospans (in set^S)

        |
        |
        v
  ---->
   d

with the left map a deduction.  Then resolutions compose as cospans:

                |
                |
           d'   v
          ---->
        |       |
        |       |
        v    po v
  ---->   ---->
   d

As the initial sketch orthogonal to the (original) A is the colimit of
the diagram of deductions from the empty sketch 0, one may wish to
resolve to 0:

          |
          |
          v
  0 ---->
     d

In a resolution

        X
        |
        | f
        v
  ---->
   d

think of X as a query and of f as a partial answer.

End of note.

Dear Logic/Category Theory Colleagues:

WE WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD CIRCULATE THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE:

The Department of Mathematics, National University, BOGOTA, COLOMBIA
is looking for two full-time positions at the level of associate
professor, in order to push forward its newly formed Ph.D. program in
Mathematics.   
Some of the areas of interest are MATHEMATICAL LOGIC and CATEGORY THEORY.
The most needed subexpertises are categorical logic, non-classical logics
and/or mathematical theory of computation.

Candidates are expected to have their Ph.D., some international 
publications, willingness to supervise Ph.D. thesis, strong commitment
to research and some beginning interest in doing research/teaching in spanish.

Annual salary is expected to be around $25.000 (USA).  Nevertheless, the real 
adcquisitive power of the salary goes beyond its face value.  It 
should be noted that in Bogota, for example, a fair lease of a 3-bedroom 
apartment costs aprox. $600 (USA) monthly.

Candidates should send an e-mail to
      FERNANDO ZALAMEA : fzalamea@bacata.usc.unal.edu.co
with a short resume of their curriculum vitae and a proposal of
activities to be carried on in Colombia (advanced courses/seminars,
plans about future research are encouraged).

FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS WOULD THEN BE SENT TO CANDIDATES
WHO REPLY TO THIS COMMUNICATION.

From: Tracy Combe <tlc@dcs.ed.ac.uk>

 PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC

        59th meeting - Preliminary announcement




The 59th meeting of the seminar will be held at the University of
Edinburgh's Computer Science Department over the weekend of 7-8
October 1995. This particular meeting is dedicated to Peter Freyd in
celebration of his 60th birthday. Peter of course will attend. The
seminar welcomes talks using or addressing category theory or logic,
either explicitly or implicitly, in the study of any aspect of
mathematics or science.

Unusually for this seminar, we hope to publish a proceedings of the
meeting as a special issue of the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra,
dedicated to Peter. Obviously, it is impractical for many scientists
from outside western Europe to attend the meeting, so we expect to
allow submissions to the proceedings by people who cannot attend but
would like to participate.

There are frequent rail and air connections to Edinburgh. We will
send further information on the location of the seminar, along with
local travel details to those who register, a week or so before the
meeting. For accommodation, please either see the department's world
wide web page and make your own arrangements, or submit the enclosed
request form to Tracy Combe, our very efficient secretary.

I would certainly like the vacant Chair to be filled by someone in
a field closely allied with Category Theory. So I am looking for
expressions of interest. Please feel free to contact me by email if
you are interested or have suggestions.

From: Dr. Reinhard Brger  <Reinhard.Boerger@FernUni-Hagen.de>

Dear colleagues and friends, I have the following suggestions for the
revision of the AMS classification scheme:

 - In 18A20 the word "bicategories" should be cancelled because
nowadays itusually has a different meaning. Maybe, bicategories in
the present sense should be included somethere under 18D.

 - In 18A32 facorizations of cones and cocones (or sources and sinks)
with diagonalizaion should be included as well as the orthogonality
relations between objects and morphisms, maybe also injective and
projective objects with respect to some class of morphisms.

 - The formulation "functors commuting with limits" in 18A35 should
be changed to "functors preserving limits" or "preservation of
limits (by functors)"

 - Generators (and cogenerators) should be included somewhere under
18A.

 - Accessible and locally presentable categories should be included
under 18B. Maybe topoi deserve their own section (the topos people
should decide that).
