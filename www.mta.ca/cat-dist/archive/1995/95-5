Date: Thu, 11 May 1995 10:23:31 +0100
From: Andrew Pitts <Andrew.Pitts@cl.cam.ac.uk>

  
  
  		   A Newton Institute Summer School
  
  		 SEMANTICS AND LOGICS OF COMPUTATION
  		  
  			25--29 September 1995
  		   Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK
  
  		      in collaboration with the
  		       ESPRIT CLICS-II project
  
  		     Second Call for Registration
  
  The Summer School on Semantics and Logics of Computation is being held
  as part of a six-month research programme on Semantics of Computation
  at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, a new
  international research centre in Cambridge UK. The Summer School is
  sponsored by the CEC ESPRIT research project "Categorical Logic in
  Computer Science, II" (CLICS-II). The aim is to present a number of
  modern developments in semantics and logics of computation in a way
  that is accessible to graduate-level students. Registrations from
  postgraduate students will be given priority, but applications by
  interested academics and industrialists are also welcomed.

  		      Thierry Coquand (Chalmers)
  	      "Computational content of classical logic"
  			     (4 lectures)
  
  I will give an introduction to the problem of extracting constructive
  content from classical proofs.  This problem has an interesting
  history since it was an important part of Hilbert's program, who
  wanted to "secure" non-constructive parts of mathematics. It has been
  revived recently by the discovery of intringuing connections with some
  concepts in computer science through the work of (among others)
  C. Murthy, M. Parigot (lambda-mu calculus), J.L. Krivine (connection
  with imperative programing), Ph. de Groote (connections with
  exceptions in ML), and S. Berardi (symmetric lambda-calculus). I will
  try to provide both historical and mathematical background to this
  problem and to present concrete examples of non-constructive reasoning
  in mathematics that is constructively problematic. The emphasis will
  be on the proof-theoretical side, but I hope that this course will
  motivate and serve as an introduction to the more recent, computer
  science oriented work cited above (which will be described briefly).
  
  A tentative plan is the following
  
  Lecture 1: negative (double negation) translation, Friedman's
  A-translation. An existential statement provable in PA is provable in
  HA.
  
  Lecture 2: Gentzen's sequent calculus, first consistency proof for
  classical arithmetic. Connection to Novikov's calculus and
  game-theoretic interpretation.
  
  Lecture 3: problem with the combination Axiom of Choice + Excluded
  Middle. How this problem is solved in C. Murthy's thesis. A
  realizability interpretation of the negative translation of the Axiom
  of Choice.
  
  Lecture 4: use of formal topology (constructive theory of locales) for
  extracting constructive content from non-constructive
  proofs. Application to the topological proof of van der Waerden's
  theorem on arithmetical progression.

  		      Martin Hofmann (Edinburgh)
       "Dependent type theory: syntax, semantics, and applications"
  			     (4 lectures)
  
  The aim of this course is to familiarise participants with the use of
  dependent types from the viewpoint of their categorical
  semantics. Dependent types are types depending on values, for instance
  lists of a fixed length (arrays), the type of constructive proofs of a
  fixed proposition, the type of certain algebraic structures over a
  fixed set, etc.  Categorical semantics provides a general framework
  for formulating and verifying interpretations of dependent types.
  
  The course will start with an introduction to theories of dependent
  types covering Martin-Lof's type theory, the Logical Framework,
  and the Calculus of Constructions. Guided by syntactic intuition we
  develop the notion of "categories with families", a simple yet
  sufficiently general notion of categorical semantics, and define the
  interpretation of the syntax therein. We then look at some instances
  such as term models and realisability models and compare to other
  semantic notions, in particular models based on fibrations. Finally,
  we treat some larger applications from Computer Science, such as 
  Paulin-Mohring's method of program extraction from proofs, Moggi's
  work on semantics of modules, and the groupoid interpretation of
  Martin-Lof's type theory.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  			Eugenio Moggi (Genova)
  		"Computational types and applications"
  			     (4 lectures)
  
  The prerequisites for this course are some knowledge of typed lambda
  calculus and equational logic. I will avoid use of domain theory as
  much as possible, because the basic ideas do not rely on it. However,
  the more sophisticated examples will have to make use of it.

  	       Mogens Nielsen & Glynn Winskel (Aarhus)
  		       "Models for concurrency"
  			     (4 lectures)
  		       
  In these lectures we will highlight a selection of the mathematical
  structures used in modelling parallel computation, ranging from
  "interleaving" models like transition systems to models like Petri
  nets and Mazurkiewicz traces, where concurrency is represented more
  explicitly by a form of causal independence.  The presentation is
  unified by casting the models in a category-theoretic framework.
  Category theory is used to provide abstract characterisations of
  constructions like parallel composition, and broadly applicable
  definitions of bisimulation, valid throughout a range of different
  models.  In addition, category theory yields formal means for
  translating between different models.
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  		       Andrew Pitts (Cambridge)
      "Operationally-based theories for proving program properties"
  			     (3 lectures)
  
  The aim of the lectures will be to describe recent advances in
  techniques based on operational semantics for establishing equivalence
  of programs.  The co-inductive characterization of contextual
  equivalence between functional programs in terms of "applicative
  bisimulation" will be presented. The use of co-induction for reasoning
  about lazy datatypes will be illustrated. The extent to which this
  characterization generalizes to "impure" functional languages will be
  discussed.

CT95 Fifth Message

The information about CT95 is now also available on the Web. You can
either point to URL
http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/ct95.html
or access through the categories home page. Links to ascii versions of 
registration forms and regional tourist information are included.

It is also possible to contact Tourism Nova Scotia by e-mail. The address is

nsvisit@fox.nstn.ca

A representative stated the following:

``If people contact us for information, we can forward our Nova Scotia Travel 
Guide. It is approximately 300 pages and it contains information on 
attractions, accommodations, events and things to see and do in all of Nova 
Scotia. We would be pleased to forward information to anyone interested.''

They mean that, upon request by e-mail, they will physically mail you the 
publication. If you plan to spend some time before or after the meeting
seeing Nova Scotia (an excellent idea) then you will find this publication
extremely useful. A further enquiry about road maps produced the following:

``We can also provide maps and package information to anyone interested.
If people let us know what type of information they are looking 
for, we can provide packages containing the best information for them.
If you are hosting a conference, we can also assist with reservations.Suzanne 
Morrison from our office can assist in obtaining room blocks and we can 
actually make reservations on our North American tollfree line to save people 
making long distance calls directly to the hotels.''   

The response time may be a little slow. They probably do not have anybody
dedicated to answering e-mail but some of you may still find the service
more efficient than physical mail. The North American tollfree line is the
one that we mentioned earlier:

1-800-565-0000

The accommodation service in question is quite distinct from the university 
service that was descibed in the third announcement. Concerning university
accommodation for STUDENTS, it should be pointed out that the rate of
$20/nightly, $110/weekly, which was advertised for the Category Theory
Summer School, is available during CT95 too. Students should declare
themselves as such, immediately upon arrival, to obtain this rate.

Re: transportation to Halifax from Halifax Airport
From: Mike Wendt

There are two ways to get from the airport to Halifax: 
BUS. The airport bus departs approximately every half hour from 6am to 12am 
and costs $11 one way, $18 return. The ride takes about thirty five minutes 
and the bus stops at various downtown hotels. Of these, the Lord Nelson and
the Halifax Holiday Inn are closest to the university. From either, the taxi
fare to the university should be about $5.
TAXI. The cost of a taxi from the airport to Halifax is approximately $35.

We propose that if several people arrive on the same flight, they share a
taxi. If you are interested in sharing, please send your flight arrival
information (flight number and arrival time) to:

	      wendt@cs.dal.ca

We will put people in touch with each other. The airport is not large. A 
good place to meet is in the domestic baggage claim area, near the exit
from international arrivals. International passengers must pass through 
customs and go through a door which opens on the domestic baggage claim area.

From: Uffe Engberg <engberg@daimi.aau.dk>



                        Postdoctoral positions at BRICS


There are several postdoctoral positions at BRICS for a period of one to two
years starting this year, 1995.  Applications by researchers are welcome in the
areas of logic, semantics, algorithms and complexity theory.  Applications for
positions should preferably be sent by e-mail and include curriculum vitae and
two or three names of referees for recommendations as well as the referees'
regular mail addresses and, if possible, e-mail addresses (see below).


BRICS, a Centre for Basic Research in Computer Science, is funded by the Danish
National Research Foundation for the period 1994-1999.  Its aim is to establish
in Denmark important areas of basic research in the mathematical foundations of
Computer Science, notably Algorithmics and Mathematical Logic.  The Centre is
to develop these areas as a joint effort between the theoretical-computer-
science groups at Aarhus University and Aalborg University.  The research plan
is based on a committment to develop Algorithmics and Logic integrated with
existing strong activities in Semantics of Computation, using a combination of
long-term efforts and a number of short-term, intensive programmes, within
carefully chosen scientific themes.  Organizationally, BRICS is an autonomous
centre with its own management, and yet with its activities strongly integrated
in the existing infrastructure and student environments at the two
universities.

The scientific planning is the responsibility of the following committee:


        Glynn Winskel, Professor (Aarhus), Director
        Mogens Nielsen, Associate Professor (Aarhus), Codirector

From: scollo@cs.utwente.nl (Pippo Scollo)

Dear Bob,

In view of the frequent (and most welcome!) relevance of contributions
from the forum you moderate to the AMAST newsletter, I would appreciate
it if you could distribute the enclosed information.
  Thank you very much, in advance.
  Regards,
           Pippo
                 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[Please accept my apologies if you receive this message more than once.
                                                             G. Scollo]

  The AMAST newsletter (the acronym stands for Algebraic Methodology
And Software Technology, from the name of a related conference series),
called _AMAST Links_, was started last year as an experiment. This has
made quite good progress so far, and has now reached some sort of
definite shape. Here's some more information about the AMAST newsletter
and the related mailing list.
  _AMAST Links_ is issued monthly and has two forms: plain-text and
hypertext. The plain-text form is distributed by e-mail, while both
forms are made available on the World-Wide Web (WWW) and by anonymous
FTP. In the hypertext form, links to more detailed information, or to
information otherwise related to the announcements, are included when
available.
  If you wish to have a look at individual pages of the latest issue of
_AMAST Links_, or to previous issues, and if you have access to the
WWW, then please open either of the following:

   WWW URL: http://www.cs.utwente.nl/data/amast/links/AL-Index.html
   FTP URL: ftp://ftp.cs.utwente.nl/pub/doc/amast/links/AL-Index.html

whereby you should get to a page which provides you with links to all
the issues of the AMAST newsletter appeared so far.
  A more general index to all the AMAST information maintained on the
WWW- and FTP- servers at the University of Twente (in The Netherlands)
is available at either of the following URL: 

   WWW URL: http://www.cs.utwente.nl/data/amast/Index.html
   FTP URL: ftp://ftp.cs.utwente.nl/pub/doc/amast/Index.html

  If you do not have access to the WWW, you may get a detailed outline
of that information by FTP from

   host: ftp.cs.utwente.nl
   username: anonymous
   (please give your e-mail address as password)
   directory: pub/doc/amast/
   file (plain ASCII text): README

  In addition to the newsletter, AMAST subscribers may receive (if they
wish so) e-mail messages sent to the list by other subscribers. This
communication form is neither direct nor immediate, however. Messages
sent to the list communication address

   amast@cs.utwente.nl

are collected into a digest, which is distributed at a frequency not
higher than fortnightly. Because of the availability of _AMAST Links_
to host announcements and the like, the digest usually has a very
modest size.
  Subscription to _AMAST Links_ and/or to the AMAST e-mail digest is
free of charge, and is obtained by sending a message to the list
management address

   amast-request@cs.utwente.nl

where a subscription option may be specified. The following options are
available:

   S1: (default) full newsletter and e-mail digest,
   S2: full newsletter, but no e-mail digest,
   S3: ToC-only option (no e-mail digest, by default),
   S4: ToC-only option, but with e-mail digest as well.

  In particular, the ToC-only version of each issue of AMAST Links only
contains the first and the last page of that issue, which respectively
list the page titles and the contributors to that issue. The ToC-only
option is thus well-suited for those who wish to receive a low-volume,
summary information by e-mail, and then access the items of interest by
FTP or on the WWW.
  For more information, please send a message to the list information
address

   amast-info@cs.utwente.nl

specifying your request.

Subject: cocomplete toposes having no small set of generators 

From: Thomas Streicher <streicher@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>
Date: Fri, 05 May 1995 16:14:50 MESZ

One possible very concise definition of GROTHENDIECK topos is as an elementary 
topos E  such that 

1) E is locally small
2) E has small sums
3) E has a small set of generators

One knows that a lex category  B  satisfies  1) and 2) iff the global sections
functor  Gamma : B -> Set has a lex left adjoint Delta.
For an elemenatry topos E satisfying 1) and 2) the condition
3) is equivalent to the requirement that any object X of E is a SUBQUOTIENT of
a Delta(I).

Now may question is 

   WHAT IS THE STATUS of LOCALLY SMALL COCOMPLETE ELEMENTARY TOPOSES

Are there natural examples ??

Locally small cocomplete elementary toposes are sufficient for interpreting 
set theory. Can they - maybe -  characterised via this property ?
Do there exist models of set theory giving rise to cocomplete topoi which
don't have a small set of generators ?

The background of my question is that elementary toposes as such don't provide
models of IZF (how should one simulate the Goedel-Bernays-Neumann hierarchy ?).
It would be nice iff cocomplete topoi were the precise analogon of IZF !
But maybe that's hoping too much ?

Grateful for any hints,
Thomas Streicher

What about small G-sets, where G is a LARGE group.  This was the classic
example of an equational category that isn't varietal, that is lacks
free algebras.  A classic example, anyway.

  Abstract
  --------
  
  Shapely types separate data, represented by lists, from shape, or
  structure. This separation supports shape polymorphism, where
  operations are defined for arbitrary shapes, and shapely operations,
  for which the shape of the result is determined by that of the input,
  permitting static shape checking. The shapely types are closed under
  the formation of fixpoints, and hence include the usual algebraic
  types of lists, trees, etc. They also include other standard data
  structures such as arrays, graphs and records.

From: Peter Freyd <pjf@saul.cis.upenn.edu>

Thomas Streicher asks about cocomplete topoi that aren't Grothendieck.
The standard example is as follows: an object is a "base set,"  B,
together with an "operator set,"  C, with an action  a:B x C -> B
such that for every  c:C  it is the case that  \b.abc  is a permutation.
One uses the convention that  abc = b  for all  c  not in  C. (So one
may think of this as a set on which the entire universe acts, the
action "having small support".) Given a second such object  B', C', a',
a map from the first to the second is a function  f:B -> B' such that 
f(abc)  = a'(fb)c  all  b:B  and  c:(C union C'). This yields a topos
and the forgetful functor to the cat of sets is logical (which tells
one how to construct power-sets). 

If one drops the "\b.abc  is a permutation" condition the resulting
cat is not a topos but satisfies the Giraud definition except for
the generating set.

The Fourman interpretation of IZF arising from a cocomplete topos
(I can't find Fourman's paper in MathSci -- look at my paper in the
Mac Lane Festschrift, JPAA Vol 19, 1980) only refers to its
"well-founded part."  One needs "ur elements," that is, one needs
IZFA, to get out of the well-founded part.

The standard example is to be found in 1.96(10) in Cats and
Allegators.

As for the connection with IZF take a look at the Mac Lane
Festschrift, JPAA Vol 19 (1980), for papers by Fourman and me.  
IZF without ur-elements is not enough. One needs IZFA.

For some reason the other day I couldn't find on MathSci Mike's paper
on the connection between cocomplete topoi and Zermelo-Fraenkel. It's
in plain sight:

  AU Fourman, Michael P.
  TI Sheaf models for set theory.
  SO J. Pure Appl. Algebra (Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra) 19
(1980), 91--101.
  DT Journal
  AB ``Set theory'' means Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, with atoms,
formulated in intuitionistic logic. ``Sheaf model'' means an
interpretation in a locally small, complete topos. If A is an object
in such a topos {script}E, the cumulative hierarchy V{sub} alpha (A),
with A as the object of atoms, is defined in the expected way, with
power objects at successor stages and direct limits at limit stages,
and with the membership relation on V{sub} alpha (A) and the embedding
of V{sub} beta (A) in V{sub} alpha (A) for beta < alpha being defined
by induction simultaneously with V{sub} alpha (A). Formulas of set
theory in which all quantifiers are bounded by V{sub} alpha (A)'s have
a well-known interpretation in {script}E, since they are formulas of
the internal logic of {script}E. The completeness and local smallness
of E enable the author to interpret unbounded quantifiers as well. The
truth value of ({all} x) phi (x) is the infimum of the truth values of
the approximations ({all} x{in}V{sub} alpha (A)) phi (x) and
existential quantifiers are handled similarly. The main theorem
asserts that the axioms of set theory, as well as the axioms and rules
of the underlying intuitionistic logic, are correct for this
interpretation; if {script}E is Boolean then classical logic is also
correct. The author gives three sorts of examples; (a) Fraenkel-
Mostowski models, (b) Boolean-valued extensions, and (c) symmetric
extensions. The main novelty here is in (a). If A is a set of atoms, G
a group of permutations of A, {script}F a normal filter of subgroups
of G, and M the associated Fraenkel-Mostowski model, then ordinary
truth in M is the same as the author's interpretation in the
Grothendieck topos {script}E of continuous G- sets, i.e. G-sets each
of whose points has its stabilizer in {script}F. This is true despite
the fact that {script}E is only a part of the (non- Grothendieck)
topos of sets and functions of M. The latter topos, which we also call
M, contains sets on which not G, but only some subgroup in {script}F,
acts. These sets are not objects of {script}E, but they are elements
of such objects (specifically of the V{sub} alpha (A)'s) and so
contribute to the interpretation of set-theoretic formulas.
(Reviewer's remark: M is obtainable from {script}E by making supports
split; it is the direct limit, in the sense of logical morphisms, of
the slice topoi {script}E/(G/H) where H ranges over {script}F. This
sort of construction was used by P. J. Freyd [Bull. Austral. Math.
Soc. 7 (1972) 1 - 76; MR 53#576; corrigenda, ibid. 7 (1972), 467 -
480; MR 54#7571].) In connection with (b), the author mentions the
unpublished result of Higgs that the topos of sets and functions of a
Boolean-valued model V{sup}B is equivalent to the topos of sheaves on
B for the canonical topology, and he indicates that his
interpretation, with A={empty}, coincides with the usual
interpretation in V {sup}B. Finally, he shows that symmetric
extensions can be obtained as the pure part (i.e. A=0) of Boolean
extensions of Fraenkel-Mostowski models. (As far as the reviewer
knows, this approach to symmetric extensions was first used by
P. Vopenka and P. Hajek [Theory of semisets, Academia, Prague, 1972;
MR 56#2824].)

Quillen closed model structures for sheaves,
to appear in {\em Journal Pure Appl. Algebra} 100 (1995).

Abstract:
In this paper I give a general procedure of transferring closed model
structures along adjoint functor pairs. As applications I derive from a
global closed model structure on the category of simplicial sheaves
closed model structures on the category of sheaves of 2-groupoids, the
category of bisimplicial sheaves and the category of simplicial sheaves
of groupoids. Subsequently, the homotopy theories of these categories
are related to the homotopy theory of simplicial sheaves.

Pasting presentations for $\omega$-categories.

Abstract:
The pasting theorem showed that pasting schemes are useful in studying
free $\omega$-categories. It was thought that their inflexibility with
respect to composition and identities prohibited wider use. This is not
the case: there is a way of dealing with identities which makes it
possible to describe $\omega$-categories in terms of generating pasting
schemes and relations between generated pastings, \ie{}, with pasting
presentations. In this paper I develop the necessary machinery for
this. The main result, that the $\omega$-category generated by a
pasting presentation is universal with respect to respectable families
of realizations, is a generalization of the pasting theorem.

Sjoerd E. Crans
Pasting schemes for the monoidal biclosed structure on
$\omega\mbox{-} \bf Cat$.

Abstract:
Using the theory of pasting presentations, developed in the previous
paper, I give a detailed description of the tensor product on
$\omega$-categories, which extends Gray's tensor product on
$2$-categories and which is closely related to Brown-Higgins's tensor
product on $\omega$-groupoids.
Immediate consequences are a general and uniform definition of higher
dimensional lax natural transformations, and a nice and transparent
description of the corresponding internal homs. Further consequences
will be in the development of a theory for weak $n$-categories, since
both tensor products and lax structures are crucial in this.

Subject: The effective topos. 

Date: Mon, 22 May 1995 13:22:11 +0100
From: Justin Pearson <justin@dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk>


Dear All,

A question for people who know about the effective topos.
I'm just feeling my way, so be gentle.

In the effective topos (and any other realizability topos I assume,
but I don't know since I haven't got hold of the tripos paper yet),
one can make internal the combinators S and K. I assume that you
define the functional relations:

        G_s(n,n') = {n'} if Sn = n' \emptyset otherwise.

        G_k(n,n') = {n') if Kn = n' \emptyset otherwise.

(In all this S refers to the combinator S not the successor function).

Now here is the bit I'm not sure about, if we stipulate in a category, 
that there must be an object N with a unique pair of maps S and K such that:
        

         for all x,y    K;x;y = x 
         for all x,y,z  S;x;y;z = x;z;(y;z)


Further every map from N to N can be factored into S and K, and for
good measure that N is actually the natural number object to avoid 
degeneracy. Does this characterize N in the effective topos? and hence
the modest sets? 

Regards

Justin Pearson

           11th ADT Workshop and 8th General Compass Meeting

                September 19 1995 -- September 23 1995

                       2nd Call for Participation

Workshop on Specification of Abstract Data Types and ESPRIT Compass Meeting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The two joint events will take place at Holmenkollen in Oslo.  The
workshop starts just after lunch-time Tuesday September 19, and lasts till
Saturday evening September 23.  Before the workshop a meeting of the IFIP
WG 14.3 (Foundations of Systems Specifications) will be held the same
place starting just after lunch-time Monday September 18.
The workshop will provide an opportunity to meet colleagues, to present
recent and ongoing work and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

The workshop is organised by Olaf Owe and Ole-Johan Dahl from the
University of Oslo, and Magne Haveraaen from the University of Bergen.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
 - algebraic specifications;
 - other approaches to formal specification;
 - specification languages and methods;
 - term rewriting and proof systems;
 - specification development systems (concepts, tools, etc.).
As this is the final COMPASS year we have searched for invited speakers
who may put the area of algebraic methods in a wider perspective, assess
its practical value, and hopefully indicate possible future directions and
links to related areas.  The invited speakers include:
 - E. Astesiano (Universita di Genova, Italy)
 - R. Burstall (University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom)
 - H. Ehrig (Technische Universitdt Berlin, Germany)
 - C.A.R. Hoare (Oxford University, United Kingdom)
 - J. Horning (DEC Systems Research Center, Palo Alto, Ca, USA)
 - B. Krieg-Bruckner (Universitdt Bremen, Germany)
 - P. Lescanne (CRIN, Nancy, France)
In addition there will be many prominent speakers from within the COMPASS
project.

The proceedings, consisting of a selection of the presented talks through
the usual referee process, will be published after the workshop, probably
in the Lecture Notes series of the Springer-Verlag (see e.g. the Recent
Trends in Data Type Specifications series, no. 332, 534, 655, 785, ...).

Please note:
as there is a limited number of slots for talks, REGISTER NOW!
We will accept speakers essentially in the order of arrival date of their
registrations (a corrective mechanism is organised in order to guarantee
visibility to every site).  So if you plan to have a talk please let us
know as soon as possible (communication via e-mail or WWW is suggested).


Location
--------
The workshop will be held at the Soria Moria Conference Center at
Holmenkollen in Oslo, just 12 km from downtown and 14 km from the
airport.  The centre is located on the top of a hill, Voksenkollen, 500 m
above sea level, overlooking the Oslo Fjord. It is bordering "Nordmarka",
the Oslo forest national park, covering a huge area with lakes, forest and
hills.  Whereas September is too early for skiing, it is a good time for
hiking, with trees in fall colours.  For sporty participants we plan a
hiking excursion to an old-fashioned log-cabin serving homemade food.

An alternative excursion will show some of the interesting places in Oslo,
such as the Viking ship museum (with authentic viking ships), the old
stave church, the Vigeland sculpture park, Aker brygge (a fjord-front
shopping and restaurant area with new and old architecture), the Munch
Museum and the Holmenkollen ski jump national monument.

Depending on the number of accompanying persons, and their interests, we
will try to improvise some additional informal sightseeing.  Also, one may
take a suburban train to downtown Oslo in 30 minutes and visit the center
(around Karl Johans gate) with museums, shops, and walking streets, all
close together.

For those interested in seeing more of Norway, such as the famous west
coast fjords, the mountains, or the north of Norway, we will provide
information about trips taking a few days or more. We especially recommend
the Norway-in-a-nutshell trip, which includes the famous train ride from
the mountains down to Flem and a boat tour on the Sognefjord. It is
possible to make this tour starting from Oslo in the morning and returning
to Oslo by night-train, or extend the trip to include a visit to Bergen.


Accommodation
-------------
According to tradition, the workshop is planned on a residential base, so
participants are required to stay at the Soria Moria hotel. It is a modern
hotel with excellent conference facilities, including swimming pool and
sauna.

Normal arrival is expected Tuesday September 19 after lunch, and departure
on Sunday September 24 after breakfast, with the possibility of extending
the stay in both directions. Participants to the IFIP WG 14.3 meeting are
expected to arrive Monday September 18 after lunch.

We have reserved a number of rooms, both single and double, and expect to
be able to accommodate everybody registering {\bf before June 15}.  We
will try to accommodate people registering by July 31, depending on room
availability.

Please note:
the single rooms will be assigned essentially following a FIFO principle;
thus if you want a single room, book it now.


Prices
------
We have an agreement with the hotel for a special price for full board
during the workshop. For a single room this amounts to 880 NOK per day,
and to 620 NOK per day per person in a double room.

For the whole workshop the prices in Norwegian Crowns (NOK) amount to:

                 ! WADT/COMPASS (Tue-Sun)  ! WG14.3/WADT/COMPASS (Mon-Sun)
-----------------+-------------------------+------------------------------
single room      ! 4400 NOK (ca. 530 ECU)  ! 5280 NOK (ca. 640 ECU)
double room, p.p.! 3100 NOK (ca. 375 ECU)  ! 3720 NOK (ca. 450 ECU) 
-----------------+-------------------------+------------------------------

Note that the prices in ECU are obtained at the current rate (which can
be different in September).

As usual a reasonable registration fee will be charged, to cover expenses
like proceedings publication, social events and so on.  The precise amount
has still to be established, depending on the real costs and the funds
that can be raised to cover them, but we expect it to be no more than 200
ECU. Some support may be available for participants from countries with
soft currencies. Applications for support must be received by the
registration deadline.


Travel Information
------------------
The Soria Moria hotel is easily reachable by bus and taxi from downtown
Oslo or directly from the Fornebu Airport in Oslo, with direct flight
connections from most major European cities. Intercontinental travel is
usually via Copenhagen, but some direct connections exist.  The dates for
the events have been chosen so that participants can make use of reduced
airfares (PEX, APEX). There are also direct ferry conections to Kiel and
Copenhagen.


Other information
-----------------
More organisational details will follow, and registered participants will
be kept informed. Updated information will also be available on the
World-Wide Web (WWW) at URL:
                      http://www.ifi.uio.no/~adt95/

    AS THERE IS A LIMITED NUMBER OF PLACES AVAILABLE FOR THE WORKSHOP,

principle; thus if you want a single room, {\em book it now}.


\subsubsection*{Prices}
We have an agreement with the hotel for a special price for full board
during the workshop. For a single room this amounts to 880 NOK per day,
and to 620 NOK per day per person in a double room.

\noindent
For the whole workshop the prices in Norwegian Crowns (NOK) amount to:

double room, p.p. & 3100 NOK ($\approx$ 375 ECU) & 3720 NOK ($\approx$ 450 ECU)  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Note that the prices in ECU are obtained at the current rate (which can
be different in September).
\smallskip

As usual a reasonable registration fee will be charged, to cover expenses
like proceedings publication, social events and so on.  The precise amount
has still to be established, depending on the real costs and the funds
that can be raised to cover them, but we expect it to be no more than 200
ECU. Some support may be available for participants from countries with
{\em soft currencies}. Applications for support must be received by the
registration deadline.


\subsection*{Travel Information}
The Soria Moria hotel is easily reachable by bus and taxi from downtown
Oslo or directly from the Fornebu Airport in Oslo, with direct flight
connections from most major European cities. Intercontinental travel is
usually via Copenhagen, but some direct connections exist.  The dates for
the events have been chosen so that participants can make use of reduced
airfares (PEX, APEX). There are also direct ferry conections to Kiel and
Copenhagen.

\subsection*{Other information}
More organisational details will follow, and registered participants will
be kept informed. Updated information will also be available on the

Subject: question about bounded toposes 

Date: Mon, 22 May 95 19:09:45 +0300
From: Zinovy Diskin <diskin@frame.riga.lv>

Topos theoretic concepts are implicitly in the focus of semantic modeling --
an active subarea of the DataBase research. The corresponding theory
developed in the DB community is a diverse collection of awkward
pseudo-formal constructs, semi-formal correct specifications (whose precise
counterparts are however known in Category Theory long ago), and also deep
insights elaboration of which seems can contribute to CT itself.

In particular, the following categorial construct which I'd call a
{\em bounded power-object}
is extremely useful in DB theory and my question is whether it was
explored by anybody before.

DEFINITION 1.  A category ${\cal C}$ is said to have {\em bounded power-objects}
if any jointly monic pair (relation), f:R-->a, g:R-->B, can be extended to the following
commutative diagram (PDiag):

            B===B     where the square (r,s,n,f) is pull-back
            ^   ^     and (s,e) is jointly monic.
           e|   |
          s |   |
       P<---E   |g
       ^    ^   |
      r|    |n  |
       |    |   |
       A<---R===R
          f

In addition, this augmentation enjoys the following universal property:
for any other similar augmentation of (f,g): (PDiag') with P',E',r' etc
instead of P,E,r etc. there are uniquely determined arrows u1:P-->P' and
u2:E-->E' commuting the entire diagram (PDiag)+(PDiag').
It is easy to prove that bounded power-objects are unique up to isomorphism.

So, given an object B, there is no the universal power-object of the object
B, ${\bf P}B $, but for any relation R=(f,g) with B a domain there is the
R-specific power-object ${\bf P}_{R}B $. Thus, B has many power-objects
indexed by relations to B.
Of course, if ${\cal C}$ is cocomplete they can be joined into the
universal power-object of B but unbounded cocompleteness is just the property
we wish to avoid.

DEFINITION 2. {\em A bounded topos} is a category with finite limits and
finite colimits which has bounded power-objects for all jointly monic pairs
of arrows.
REMARK 1. I do not familiar with Mikkelsen's proof that finite limits and
power-objects imply finite colimits so I do not know  to what extent the
finite colimits condition can be relaxed.
REMARK 2. The concept of bounded topos constitutes a natural universe for
computationally feasible set theory. Indeed, bounded power-sets are tractable
(ie, within the polynomial time computability) in contrast to intractability
of finitary yet unbounded powersets.

QUESTION:  What is known about bounded toposes? What is known about
complexity evaluations of topos-theoretic operations?

CONCLUDING REMARK. The interplay between computational and descriptional complexities
is one of the most nice and exciting hot topics of the modern model theory. It seems that
exploring the interplay between two hierarchies when the descriptional one is
specified in the language of graph-based topos-theoretic operations will be
of equal beaty but simultaneously of a much more immediate practical impact.

Grateful for any comments and remarks,
Zinovy Diskin

From: Peter Freyd <pjf@saul.cis.upenn.edu>

I'm having trouble interpreting the question posed by Justin
Pearson. If  N  is the natural numbers object then it certainly has a
fixed-point-free self-map, which gives me trouble in figuring out
what's meant by "every map from  N  to  N  can be factored into  S 
and  K."

Date: Mon, 22 May 1995 12:50:01 -0700
From: Andrew Ensor <ensor@math.berkeley.edu>

In any category the pullback of a monic is monic, but this does not
hold for epis. However in the category Sets (or in an abelian category)
the pullback of a surjective function is surjective.
Is there another notion of "epi" for categories that is preserved 
by pullbacks, and that is surjectivity in the category Sets?

Subject: Diskin's question 

Date: Tue, 23 May 95 10:01 BST
From: Dr. P.T. Johnstone <P.T.Johnstone@pmms.cam.ac.uk>


I don't have a direct answer to Diskin's question, but here are a few
immediate comments about it.

1.  I'm not happy with the terms `bounded power-objects' and `bounded
topos', because `bounded' has another meaning in topos theory (bounded
geometric morphisms) and I sense that this could lead to confusion. It
seems to me that something like `local power-objects' would be a better
name for the concept Diskin describes ... but of course `local' is also
a word which is already heavily used by topos-theorists.

2.  I presume that the universal property of the bounded/local
power-object, as described by Diskin, is the wrong way round: that is,
one wants (P,E) to be terminal rather than initial in the category of
diagrams of the form (PDiag). (If you ask for an initial object, then
the problem always has a trivial solution: take P = A and E = R.)

3.  Assuming I'm right about (2), then the condition that an object B
has bounded power-objects is equivalent to saying that the functor
Rel(-,B) is multi-representable in the sense of Diers (rather than
representable, as it would be in a topos). There is a considerable
literature (much of it written by Diers, but some by other people
including myself) about multi-representability, multi-limits and the
like; but I don't think any of it addresses the multi-representability
of this particular functor.

4.  I'd find it a lot easier to think about the problem if I had a
simple example of a category (other than a topos) with this property,
on which to test my ideas. Does Diskin (or anyone else) have such an
example?

Effective descent morphisms. (See Carboni, Janelidze, Kelly and Pare, "On
localization and stabilization for factorization systems".) p: A -> B in C
(with finite limits) is effective descent iff the pullback functor between
slice categories, p*: C/B -> C/A, is monadic. In any topos, effective
descent = epi.

  The short answer is that only split epis (those with a right
  inverse) are preserved under pullbacks in "all" categories.

Well, yeah. But there is another short answer. I didn't know how to
answer the original note without sounding stupid. I still don't. But
there have been those who have given names to just those epis that are
preserved under pullback, the most popular being "stable epis." So:

  The short answer is that only stable epis (those preserved by
  pullbacks) are preserved under pullbacks.

Sorry about this. Anyway: split implies stable.

Of course, split epis (= retractions) will answer this if Set has choice.

Date: Wed, 24 May 95 18:41:47 +0300
From: Zinovy Diskin <diskin@frame.riga.lv>

Dear All,

I must  apologize:   the universal property of (PDiag) described
in my previous  definition  of bounded power-object is evidently
not suitable (thanks  to  Peter  Johnstone)  and  terminality of
(P,E) is also not suitable: take for P' a  superobject of  A and
for E'   a  relation  from A' to  B which  is  a  "conservative"
expansion of R -- then there are no canonical arrows from  P' to
P (and from P to P' too).

So, actually the question is open which  universal  property  of
(PDiag) provides  intended semantics of the construction.

From: Justin Pearson <justin@dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk>


Some people have been confused by my question.
This probally reflects a confusion on my part.
There are two seperat parts.
i)In the effective topos, given the internal defn. of S and
K on N. Can every map form N to N be written as arbitary (fintie) words
over S and K.
I.E. given f:N -> N, can f be writen as some word f=S^a;K^b;S^c;K^d ... for
a,b,c,d, ... > 0?

ii) If (i)  is true, then can we turn it around on its head and use it as
a definition of the natural number object N in Eff? But as Rosolini pointed out
there is a problem, do I mean every PARTIAL map can be factored?


Hope this helps, sorry about the confusion, but as I have said it is all
probally due to me.

Regards
Justin Pearson

With respect to the question from Justin Pearson, my point remains.
Since the 1930's it has been the case that if every function from
A  to  A  can be written as a combination of  S's and  K's then
every function from  A  to  A  has a fixed point. (Note the word
"combination" not just the special case thereof, "word".)

From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

It has just come to my attention that my paper, *-Autonomous categories
and linear logic, that appeared in Vol 1 of MSCS got garbled.  Virtually
all occurrences of ^\bot appear to have been changed to ~\bot so that
instead of V^\bot, you get V \bot (with extra space).  The only
exceptions occur when the ^\bot immediately follows a close parenthesis.
I had sent them a TeX file, so there is no excuse for this change, which
was doubtless made by an editorial assistant because they thought they
were improving the paper.  What it does is make it almost impossible to
make sense of.  I am astonished that in five years, nobody brought it to
my attention.  The corrected paper (with one or two cosmetic changes to
kill overfull boxes) is about to be posted on my ftp directory.  Note
also that the theorem numbering scheme has changed, back to what it was
in the original, but they no longer conform to the printed version.
