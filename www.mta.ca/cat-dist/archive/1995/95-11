Proceedings of 59th PSSL dedicated to Peter Freyd


As mentioned in the announcement of the 59th PSSL held in Edinburgh
7-8 October, there will be a proceedings published as a special
issue of the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, dedicated to 
Peter Freyd in celebration of his 60th birthday.
	Since it was only a weekend meeting, it was impractical for
many people who would like to honour Peter to attend. So submissions
are open to everyone.
	The deadline for submissions is 5 February 1996. This specific
date was chosen upon Peter's suggestion as it is the date of his 60th
birthday. 
	Papers should be submitted to me in any form from which I can
make a paper copy: so postscipt files should be fine.  Papers will be
refereed to the usual standards of the Journal of Pure and Applied
Algebra, and any topic within the general remit of the journal is
fine.
	With best wishes to all,
		John Power.

This is to announce a research monograph, 

	First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts, 
	with Application to Category Theory

		by M. Makkai (McGill Univ.)

	(Preliminary version)


                            Abstract


J. Cartmell [2] introduced a syntax of variable types, which I call
dependent sorts, for the purposes of presenting generalized
algebraic theories. Cartmell's syntax was "abstracted from ...
Martin-Lof type theory". I add propositional connectives and
quantification to a simplified version of Cartmell's syntax, to
obtain what I call First-Order Logic with Dependent Sorts (FOLDS).
The simplification consists in the exclusion of operation symbols,
and a severe restriction on the use of equality. Quantification is
subject to the natural restriction that a quantifier "for all  x " 
or "there is  x " cannot be applied if in the resulting formula
there is a free variable whose sort depends on  x . 

An important special case of FOLDS was introduced by G. Blanc [1]
for the purpose of characterizing first-order formulas in the
language of categories that are invariant under equivalence of
categories. P. Freyd's earlier characterization [3], although not
explicitly coached in an instance of FOLDS, is essentially the same
as Blanc's. A. Preller [7] gives an explicit comparison of Blanc's
and Freyd's contexts. The main aim of the present work is to extend
Blanc's and Freyd's characterization from statements about
categories to statements about more complex categorical structures. 

   
A similarity type for structures for FOLDS is given by a one-way
category of sort-forming symbols and relation symbols. One-way
categories were isolated by F. W. Lawvere [4], and were
subsequently shown by him to be relevant for the generalized
sketch-syntax of [5]. 

The basic metatheory of FOLDS is a simple extension of that of
ordinary multisorted first-order logic. There are simply formulated
complete formal systems for both classical and intuitionistic
FOLDS, with Kripke-style completeness for the intuitionistic case.
The systems use entailments-in-contexts as their basic units;
contexts are systems of typings of variables as usual in Martin-
Lof-style systems. We have Gentzen-style systems admitting cut-
elimination. Natural forms of Craig Interpolation and Beth
Definability are true in both classical and intuitionistic FOLDS.
Much of the basic metatheory is done through the formalism of
appropriate fibrations (hyper-doctrines).

The main new concept is a notion of equivalence of structures for
FOLDS. Equivalent structures satisfy the same sentences of FOLDS.
The main general result is that conversely, first order properties
invariant under equivalence are expressible in FOLDS. A stronger
version of the result takes the form of an interpolation theorem.

Two categories are equivalent in the usual sense iff they are
equivalent as structures for FOLDS. This connection between the
categorical concept of equivalence and FOLDS-equivalence persists
for more complex categorical structures such as (1) a diagram of
categories, functors and natural transformations, or (2) a
bicategory, or (3) a diagram of bicategories, etc., if we pass to
"ana"-versions of the concepts of functor, bicategory, etc.; the
latter were introduced in [6]. Every functor, bicategory, etc., has
its so-called saturation, a simply defined saturated anafunctor,
saturated anabicategory, etc., respectively. A property written in
FOLDS of the saturation is a particular, "good", kind of first-
order property of the original.

Applications of the foregoing give syntactical characterizations of
properties invariant under equivalence in the contexts mentioned.
E.g., a first-order property of a variable bicategory is invariant
under biequivalence iff it is expressible in FOLDS as a property of
the saturated anabicategory canonically associated with the given
bicategory.

The book
"Categorical Structure of Closure Operators" by D. Dikranjan and W. Tholen
has appeared in the "Mathematics and Its Applications" series of Kluwer
Academic Publishers (Dordrecht, Boston, London 1995; ISBN 0-7923-3772-7).

Abstract: The book provides a comprehensive categorical theory of closure
operators, with applications to topological and uniform spaces, groups,
R-modules, fields and topological groups, as well as to partially ordered
sets and graphs. In particular, closure operators are used to give
solutions to the epimorphism and cowellpoweredness problem in many
concrete categories. The material is illustrated with many examples and
exercises, and open problems are formulated in order to stimulate further
research.

Subject: local_set_theory 

Date: Mon, 27 Nov 95 11:23:50 MET
From: koslowj@iti.cs.tu-bs.de

The following question concerning the book "Toposes and Local Set
Theories" by J. L. Bell was posed by Markus Michelbrink, a logician
from the University of Hannover.  I am just forwarding it to the list.

[Remark. The book has been reviewed for the Journal of Symbolic Logic by
G. C. Wraith shortly after it appeared.  The reviewer comments on the
author's unfortunate bias towards locally small categories.]

Markus has a problem with the footnote on p. 86.  For a local set theory S,
Bell proceeds to define a category C(S).  The footnote says:

"Strictly speaking, for this to be the case we need also show that the
collection of S-maps between any pair of S-sets forms an (intuitive)
set.  Actually, this follows easily from the assumption made initially
that the collection of function symbols of \cal L of a given signature
forms a set: we leave the proof to the reader."

Markus' argument, why this may not be so obvious, is as follows:

Form a local language \cal L with a proper class of ground type
symbols, and fix two arbitrary ground type symbols A' and B'.  For
every ground type symbol A let there be exactly one function symbol
f_A:PA --> P(A' x B').  The function symbols for any signature then
form a set, namely either the empty set, or a singleton.  Now for 
any ground type symbol A there is a closed term

   f_A({x_A:true})

of type P(A' x B'), and for distinct ground type symbols A,B these
closed terms are distinct.  Hence we have a proper class of closed
terms of type P(A' x B').

Consider the local set theory S that is generated by the proper class
of sequents

   <\emptyset, f_A({x_A:true})\in {x_B':true}^{x_A':true}>

where A is a ground type symbol. [I.e., we require the f_A-image of A to
be a function from A' to B'.] 

S induces an equivalence relation ~S via

   X ~S Y iff |-_S X=Y 

This equivalence relation partitions the class of closed terms \tau of
type P(A' x B') with |-_S \tau \in {x_B':true}^{x_A':true}, i.e.,
those terms which represent functions from A' to B' in S.

Question 1: why should this partition have a *set* of representatives?

Question 2: can there be any distinct ground type sumbols A and B such
that f_A({x_A:true} and f_B({x_B:true} are S-equivalent?

[I hope the ASCII transcriptions and the occasional quasi-TeX are
self-explanatory.  Whoever has access to the book should be able to
follow the argument.]

                         TORONTO SPRING MEETING


We are planning to host a meeting on Category Theory on the weekend of

              April 13/14, 1996, at York University, Toronto.

It is our intention to follow the style of the Montreal Oktoberfest,
although we shall also have a couple of invited speakers. Hence we call
for contributed talks from all areas of mathematics (incl. theoretical
computer science and physics) using category theory, and especially
encourage graduate students to participate. There will be a registration
fee sufficient to cover expenses for the Saturday night dinner. Graduate
students will pay a reduced fee. More detailed information will be given
in the second announcement to be sent in January. Meanwhile, if you have
any questions, please write to

                          yorkcat@mathstat.yorku.ca

We hope to see you here in April!

Subject: adjunction question 

Date: Mon, 27 Nov 1995 11:59:10 -0800 (PST)
From: Andrew Ensor <ensor@math.berkeley.edu>

I was wondering if anyone could provide me with some information on the
following:
  Suppose <F,G,eta,epsilon>:A -> B is an adjunction and let C denote
  the collection of all possible finite horizontal compositions of 
  F,G (as identity natural transformations),eta, and epsilon.
  So, for example the horizontal composite epsilon.F.eta 
  is a natural transformation in C.
  I am interested in knowing more about vertical compositions using members
  of C. For example the vertical composite of epsilon.F with F.eta is
  epsilon.F.eta, and the vertical composite of epsilon.F.G.F with
  epsilon.F.eta.eta is epsilon.epsilon.F.eta.eta.
  Must C be closed under all possible vertical compositions?
Any assistance or reference would be appreciated.
Sincerely,
Andrew Ensor.

Like Gavin Wraith, I commented adversely on Bell's insistence that
categories should be locally small, when I reviewed his book for the
L.M.S. Bulletin (vol.22 (1990), 101--102). But I failed to notice
the point raised by Michelbrink: I believe he has found a genuine
inconsistency in Bell's account of local set theories.

This is in response to Michelbrink's question, posted on the network by 
Koslowski, about the footnote on page 86 of Bell's "Toposes and Local Set 
Theories."  I agree with Michelbrink that the footnote is incorrect, and 
I pointed out the problem in my review of the book for Mathematical 
Reviews (90e:18002 --- see Reviewer's Remark (3) near the end of the 
review).
