                       UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX
            
            RESEARCH FELLOWS IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING

Two Research Fellows are required for a 3-year project entitled
``Foundations for the Integration of Concurrent Distributed and
Functional Computation'', under the direction of Prof. M. Hennessy and
funded by the EPSRC.

The aim of the project is to 

- provide a uniform coherent semantic foundation for concurrent,
distributed and functional behaviour;

- develop proof methodologies for establishing properties of process
descriptions expressed in specification languages using these
paradigms;

- develop prototypes of supporting verification systems.

The project will start on 1/10/95 and salary will be related to the
academic 1A scale. A Ph.D. in Computer Science or Mathematics or
equivalent experience is required. In addition to normal research
duties the successful candidate will be expected to provide some 
assistance to undergraduate teaching.

More details of the project and the conditions of service are available
at ftp://ftp.cogs.sussex.ac.uk/pub/users/matthewh/details.ps.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xy-pic version 3.0 released! 

Date: Fri, 7 Jul 1995 22:59:08 +0200
From: Kristoffer H. Rose <kris@diku.dk>

Dear category theorist,

Please find enclosed a copy of the TRAILER for a new version of Xy-pic.
I hope you will find it useful.

Sincerely,
            Kristoffer H. Rose

======================================================================
      ANNOUNCING the Xy-pic version 3 DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE
======================================================================

This is to announce a MAJOR RELEASE of my DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE:

			       Xy-pic 3.0

In particular most features that have been added since version 2.6 are
now sufficiently stable to leave beta-test.

Xy-pic is a package for typesetting a variety of graphs and diagrams
with TeX.  Xy-pic works with most formats (including LaTeX, AMS-LaTeX,
AMS-TeX, and plain TeX), in particular Xy-pic is provided as a LaTeX2e
`supported package' (following the `CTAN LaTeX2e bundle' standard).

Further details on the package are in the README file of the distribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
				  NEWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic version 3 is a thorough rewrite of the last major version,
version 2 (last version 2 release was release 2.6; several beta-test
releases numbered 2.7-2.12 have been made available to users).  However,
full backwards compatibility is maintained (except for the unavoidable
but fully documented obscure cases).

The package is now structured as a kernel and several orthogonal
modules, in particular there are independent `specialist' modes for
convenient typesetting of components that are structured as graphs,
matrices, polygons, 2-cells, etc.

Finally, version 3 adds the following to what was available in
v2.12/3beta:

* The User's Guide is up to date with v3 features!
* There is a new input mode specially for KNOTS AND LINKS!
* Arbitrary arcs and frames are now properly integtared!
* DVI driver interface greatly simplified!

A few DVI drivers are not quite ready for release which is why this is
v3.0 and there will be a 3.1 including the missing drivers (as well as
the inevitable bug fixes).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
			      AVAILABILITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic can be retrieved through the World Wide Web Xy-pic `home page':

----------------------------------------------------------------------
				CREDITS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic was created by Kristoffer H. Rose, DIKU, U of Copenhagen.  Most
of the rewrite was accomplished in collaboration with Ross Moore while
visiting Macquarie U, Sydney (Jan-May 1994), supported by the Australian
Research Council, Macquarie University, and using donated DEC equipment.

Xy-pic is Copyright (c) 1991-1995 by Kristoffer H. Rose under GNU

			Call for Papers
		Fifth International Conference on
	Algebraic Methodology and Software Technology
	AMAST '96,  July 1-5,  1996,  Munich, Germany

Goals
The major goal of the AMAST Conferences is to put software
development technology on a firm, mathematical foundation.
Particular emphasis is given to algebraic and logical foundations
of software technology.  An eventual goal is to establish  
algebraic and logical methodology as a practically viable and
attractive alternative to the prevailing ad hoc approaches to
software engineering.

Previous meetings of AMAST were held at the University of Iowa
(1989 and 1991), the University of Twente (1993) and Concordia
University in Montreal (1995).  During these meetings, AMAST
has attracted an international spread of researchers and practitioners
interested in software technology, programming methodology and
their algebraic and logical foundations. In addition, the first
day of each conference has been dedicated to Mathematics Education
for Software Engineers.

Following this successful trend, the fifth AMAST International
Conference will be held at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet,
Munich, Germany, from July 1 to July 5, 1996.

Submissions
As in the previous years we invite papers reporting original research
in algebra and logic, suitable as a foundation for software technology,
as well as software technologies developed by means of logic and
algebraic methodologies. A special focus of AMAST 96 will be on
the use of mathematics-based formal methods to give support for
requirement analysis, formal specification, and design in  
industrial software development.
Submissions should not have been published and should not be under
consideration for publication elsewhere.  We also solicit submissions
of system demonstrations showing the improved effectiveness of
software developed on a mathematical basis.  Finally, a special
poster session will be devoted to student research papers.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			
	systems software technology,
	application software technology,
	concurrent and reactive systems, 	
	formal methods in industrial software development,
	formal techniques for software requirements, design.
2. PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY
	logic, functional, and object paradigms,
	constraint programming and concurrency,
	program verification and transformation,
	specification languages and tools,
	formal specification and development case studies.
3. ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS
	logic, category theory, relation algebra,
	algebraic foundations for languages and systems,
	theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning,
	logics of program.
4. SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations)
	software development environments,
	support for correct software development,
	system support for reuse,
	tools for prototyping,
	validation and verification,
	theorem proving systems.

We invite prospective authors to submit 6 copies of previously
unpublished papers of high quality (15 double spaced pages maximum
for papers and 4 double spaced pages maximum for system demo  
proposals) in an area relevant to the conference theme. Papers should  
provide adequate information for the reviewers to assess the
significance and anticipated impact on the foundations of software
technology.

All papers will be refereed by the program committee, and will be
judged based on their significance, technical merit, and relevance
to the conference. All submissions (both papers and system demo 
proposals) must be sent to the program chair at the address below;
papers must be received by November 15, 1995 and system demo
proposals must be received by December 15, 1995.

I would like to find out what work has been done relating to the question 
of "conceptual completeness"  (in the sense of Makkai & Reyes (LNM 611), 
with extention by Pitts (ANAL vol 41) ) for fragments of linear logic or 
other substructural logics.

Results obtained, references and/or information on who is or has worked on 
this problem would be appreciated.

Thanks!
