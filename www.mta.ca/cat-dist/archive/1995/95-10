From: Stephen Chase <chase@math.cornell.edu>

This is a belated reply to the query of John Baez regarding the nerve of
a braided monoidal category.

I'm no expert on these matters and hence may be way off target, but it seems
to me that, for a *symmetric* monoidal category, the appropriate (and most
useful) analogue of the classifying space should be the spectrum whose
homotopy groups yield the algebraic K-theory of the category.  There is a
simplicial version of spectra which should then provide a suitable nerve.
Some of the relevant literature on this is listed below (see especially
[4, Section 5] and [5, pp. 1599-1600]).

[1] D. Grayson, Higher algebraic K-theory II (after D. Quillen), Springer
LNM 551 (1976).

[2] M. Jardine, Supercoherence, J. Pure Appl. Alg. 75 (1991), 103-194.

[3] G. Segal, Categories and cohomology theories, Topology 13 (1974), 293-
312.

[4] R. Thomason, Algebraic K-theory and etale cohomology, Ann. Scient. Ec.

[5] ____________, First quadrant spectral sequences in algebraic K-theory
via homotopy colimits, Comm. in Alg. 19 (1982), 1589-1668.

It is natural to ask whether a stable weak n-category (in the sense of
Section 5 of the recent preprint by Baez and Dolan, "Higher-dimensional
Algebra and Topological Quantum Field Theory") also has a "classifying
space" spectrum.  Such an object, if it exists, should provide a means of
constructing cohomolgy theories in which such n-categories are used as
coefficients, in a manner analogous to that in which cochain complexes
are used as coefficients in the hypercohomology theories of ordinary
homological algebra.

In general, I think that algebraic K-theory, which makes heavy use of
both category theory and stable homotopy theory, should provide clues
regarding what phenomena to expect in higher-dimensional algebra.

Subject: if a functor locally has a right adjoint does it have a global one ? 

Date: Fri, 06 Oct 1995 14:36:29 MEZ
From: Thomas Streicher <streicher@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>

Let  F : A->B be a functor. We say that F has "locally right adjoints" iff for
any object I of A the (obvious) functor F^(I) : A/I->B/FI has a right adjoint
U^(I).
My question now is :

  What are sufficient conditions guaranteeing 
  that such an F has itself a right adjoint ?

What I know is that if A has a terminal object and B has binary products, 
then if F has locally right adjoints then F has a right adjoint.
The reason is that F = Sigma_FI o F^(1) and -  as B has binary products the 
functor Sigma_F1 has right adjoint (F1)* - F has right adjoint U^(1) o (F1)*.

The main case I am interested in is the cxase where both A and B are 
"partial lex", i.e. have binary(!) pullbacks and products.  
  
I vaguely remember that some time ago on this network there was a discussion 
on functors having locally right adjoints. Maybe one of the persons involved 
in this discussion coiuld provide me with a hint.

Thanks, Thomas Streicher

	The question that you raised was exactly the on that I addressed 
in my talk at the recent Dalhousie conference in July. The abstract 
follows but if you will send me a snail mail address, I will send the 
full manscript with the full set of rather pleasing geometric diagrams 
which , in my view, makes the role of the braiding quite transparent.

Abstract: SOME APPLICATIONS OF 2-CATEGORY TECHNIQUES IN THE THEORY OF
BRAIDED TENSOR CATEGORIES John Duskin SUNY/Buffalo Two years ago, in a
Montreal talk before an audience composed mostly of category theorists,
Pierre Cartier suggested that the theory of 2-categories might prove
useful in the study of quantum groups and related topics. This work is the
result of one such investigation.
	A strict tensor (=monoidal) category may be equivalently viewed as
a monoid object in Cat or a category object in Mon. As a cat-monoid, its
nerve is a simplicial monoid whose underlying double complex is that of
2-category with a single object(= 0-cell) with 1-cells provided by the
objects of the tensor category and composition of 1-cells provided by the
tensor product . The arrows of the tensor category and their composition
give the 2-cells and their composition, and the functoriality of the
tensor product give the *-composition of 2-cells and the "interchange
law". Strict tensor functors between tensor categories become strict
2-functors between 2-categories with a single object, and it is from this
entirely equivalent point of view that we wish to pursue the subject of
this talk.
	First, about Joyal-Street "braidings": In any 2-category one can 
form the  double category of "lax-(commutative) squares" which consists 
squares of composable 1-cells together with a 2-cell connecting the  
compositions of the 1-cells on each side of the diagonal. There is an 
obvious  "horizontal composition" of such lax-squares as well as a 
vertical one and they are easily seen to satisfy the interchange law of a 
double category. Moreover, there is an obvious way to introduce 2-cells 
between lax-squares which makes the lax-squares  into a category object 
in 2-Cat which plays it play the role of representing "lax functors 
between 2-categories". Now, among these lax-squares are those which 
define the "epi-center" of the 2-category, the lax squares whose two 
vertical 1-cells are identical and whose horizontal 1-cells are as well. 
This condition forces all of the corners of square to be the same 0-cell 
and to have its "interior" to be 2-cell of the form A*B=>B*A when the 
2-category is that associated to a strict tensor category. We  define a 
(normalized) braiding on a 2-category with a single object C as a 
bi-functorial (i.e., functorial in each variable) section c of the 
epi-center of C cA.B:A*B=>B*A is easily seen to satisfy exactly the 
conditions of the Joyal-Street definition, including naturality, when the 
associativity isomorphisms are all identities, except that cA.B is not 
required to be invertible but we require c1.B=id(B) and cA.1=id(A), 
"normalization". 
	The chief advantage of this 2-category point of view of strict 
tensor categories is that it gives an  easy " geometric" way to handle 
braidings using the Sydney-School's highly efficient way of dealing with 
equations and proofs in 2-categories using "pasting diagrams".
	Now any 2-category C has its own "oriented geometric nerve" which 
can be defined as the simplicial set which has the 0-cells of C for 
0-simplices and the 1-cells for 1-simplices. 2-simplices x are defined as 
triangles of 1-cells together with a 2-cell x: d1(x)=>d2(x)*d0(x) for 
interior. 3-simplices consist of the "commutative tetrahedra" each made 
of four  compatible 2-simplices of the foregoing sort for which the 
unique composition  of the odd faces is equal to that of the even faces, 
a condition easily expressed as an equality  of the corresponding pasting 
diagrams. Degeneracies are equally well supplied, and the full nerve is 
just the coskeleton of the just defined truncated complex. From a 
simplicial point of view this nerve just corresponds to the classifying 
space of the simplicial category defined by the original 2-category which 
is its fiber. In the case here at hand of a tensor category this 
geometric nerve is a reduced (i.e., only one 0-simplex) simplicial set 
and its fiber is the simplicial monoid defined by the strict tensor 
category. The nerve is thus seen to form the first step in a simplicial 
spectrum as we will see below. (One equally well has the oppositely 
oriented version of this nerve where the 2-simplices interior is of the 
form x:d0(x)*d2(x) =>d1(x). Both are needed in the applications). 
	Now suppose that the tensor category has a braiding c, then the
nerve of C has the structure of a simplicial monoid which is trivial in
dimension 0, has the composition of 1-cells (tensor product) as
multiplication in dimension 1, but uses the braiding to define the product
of two arbitrary 2-simplices x and y using their interiors by pasting the
square c(x2,y0) between the triangles x and y to form a new 2-simplex
whose faces are exactly the products of the corresponding 1-cell faces (so
that the face maps become homomorphisms). this product is associative and
untitary (using s0(1) as unit) and the product of commutative tetrahedra
is commutative. Thus a braiding defines the structure of a simplicial
monoid on the classifying space of (C) with C as its loop complex. This
allows us to iterate the construction for one more step and obtain a new
simplicial set 2(C) which has 1(C) as its fiber.[2(C) is dgenerate in
dimensins 0 and 1,2-simplices are provided by the 1-cells of C viewed as
the "interiors of 2-simplices all of whose faces are degenerate. 
3-simplices are squares of 1-cells numbered in the odd-to -even fashion
with 2-cells now forming the interior. 3-simplices are "commutative cubes"
made out of the simplicial kernel with the braiding furnishing the
"missing square"] 2(C) is supplied the structure of a simplicial monoid if
and only if the braiding is symmetric (c2= id), in which case the
iteration can be continued indefinitely. (That symmetric monoidal
categories are infinite loop spaces was first observed by Peter May, so
what we have here is the low dimensional fragment of the symmetric case.)
	Now given any structure of a simplicial monoid on the nerve of a 
tensor category viewed in the fashion which has C as its kernel, the 
product of the degenerate 2-simplices s1(x)s0(y) may be seen to define a 
2-cell c(x,y):x*y=>y*x which may be seen to define a braiding on the 
original tensor category C and we have the Theorem: There is a bijective 
correspondence between braidings on a strict tensor category and 
simplicial monoid structures on it nerve. They define   spectra if and 
only if the braiding is symmetric. 
	Note: Most of the objects of interest in braided tensor 
categories such as algebras, co-algebras, bialgebras, braided-algebras, 
commutative algebras modules etc. have a pretty geometric picture when 
put in this 2-category frame, for example, an associative co-algebra is 
just a commutative tetrahedron in the above sense which has all of its 
1-cell faces equal.

		     A Newton Institute Workshop

		      GAMES, PROCESSES and LOGIC
		  
			 6 - 10 November 1995
		   Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK

			Call for Registration

BACKGROUND 

The workshop will take place as part of the Newton Institute programme
on the Semantics of Computation. The general aims of the programme are
twofold. First, to refine the current framework for the semantics of
computation so that it is capable of dealing with the more subtle
computational features present in the programming languages of today
and tomorrow.  Secondly, to provide a framework for interaction
between such fundamental research and the issues confronted by
language designers and software engineers. We particularly have in
mind current developments such as object-based concurrent programming,
and projects to develop the next generation of advanced programming
languages, such as ML 2000.  The range of technical and conceptual
challenges involved in this work requires active collaboration and
flow of information between overlapping communities of mathematicians,
computer scientists and computer practitioners.


WORKSHOP PROGRAMME

Games
=====

There are long-standing connections between games and logic (e.g.
determinacy of games in Set theory, Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse  games in Model
theory, dialogue games in Proof theory, etc. etc.)
More recently, games have been applied to the semantics of computation,
in a variety of ways:

 - Games provide an intrinsic model of interaction, e.g. between a system
 and its environment, with processes modelled as strategies.
 This has led to refined models of various logics,  type theories and
 programming languages.

 - ``Abstract'' notions of games (Chu spaces, Dialectica categories)
   have been used to model Linear Logic, and a variety of computational
   situations.

 - Games can be used to  characterize notions of equivalence between
 processes, such as bisimulation; and to characterize provability
 in various logical systems.

 - Probabilistic games have been used to characterize complexity classes;
 these games have been related to provability in certain fragments of
 Linear logic.

 - Game  formalisms have been used in  proving decidability of a number
 of second-order systems.

 Processes
 =========

 The notion of  concurrent process can be seen as one of the few key 
 conceptual contributions of Computer Science with no evident precursor
 in Logic or Mathematics. As such, it sets new challenges for logical
 formalization. Apart from the extensive work on applying modal and temporal
 logic to concurrency, there is also much current activity on trying
 to combine process calculi with lambda-calculus and type theory in a
 unified setting. The modelling of imperative and functional features
 in combination, as in ML or ``Algol-like'' languages, is also very
 challenging.
 Milner's action calculi aim to provide a unifying formalism in a categorical
 framework; there are many other current approaches.


 The aim of the Workshop is to  bring together researchers pursuing these
 various strands, to compare and contrast the different approaches, and take
 stock of current progress and future directions.

 The following people have already agreed to speak at the Workshop:

 Martin Hyland (dialogue games, semantics of proofs and functional programs)
 Robin Milner (action structures)
 John Mitchell, Andre Scedrov (probabilistic games, IP and Linear Logic)
 Luke Ong (dialogue games and semantics of proofs in Classical logic)
 Vaughan Pratt (Chu spaces)
 Colin Stirling (games for bisimulation and  proof tableaux in modal 
		 mu-calculus)
 Philip Scott (process interpretations of Linear Logic)


The organizers invite offers of contributed talks. These will be
selected on the basis of submitted abstracts.  Abstracts in English
(up to 2 pages) should be sent (preferably by email) to

			Prof. Samson Abramsky (GPL)
			Department of Computing
			Imperial College
			180 Queen's Gate
			London SW7 2BZ

In addition to an indication of the results to be presented in the
talk and their relevance to the theme of the workshop, the abstract
should give the talk title and the speakers's name, address, telephone
number, fax number and email address (when available).


CONFERENCE LOCATION, COSTS AND REGISTRATION

purpose-designed building, in a pleasant area in the west of
Cambridge, about one mile from the centre of the City. There will be a
registration fee of 40 pounds (includes the cost of lunches, coffee
and tea breaks). The Newton Institute can provide assistance with
finding local accommodation---the cost of which is likely to be 40
pounds per day including breakfast.

From: Jaap van Oosten <jvoosten@daimi.aau.dk>


Via Stefano Kasangian I've come in the possession of a typed
manuscript entitled "The concept of computational varieties",
written by Michael Iossif and Yoshindo Suzuki.
According to Stefano, this dates back to the (early?) 80's.
The authors develop an abstract idea of "computable function",
using sheaves; and they finally prove that their computable
functions are closed under primitive recursion.
Has anyone heard of these people? At the time of the manuscript
they worked at the Logic Division of the university of Sussex
(presumably England).
I'd be very grateful for a pointer.

This is part of a general program to describe automata as 1-cells of

reachability, minimization and minimal realization in these bicategories
of processes.  Along the way we consider appropriate notions of behaviour
for morphisms.  We use (co)lax (co)monads to describe reachability and
minimization.  Our main results are minimal realization theorems which
extend classical minimal realization to account for serial composition.

safekept by UNESCO since 1985. Five hundred years of blending Native American,
Portuguese, and African influences have left a rich culture to its people, which
can be felt on its music, food, and mysticism.  Salvador is located on the
northeastern coast of Brazil and the sun shines year round with the average
temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.  It is surrounded by palm trees and beaches
with warm water.  City population is around 2.5 million and life style is quite
relaxed.\\

			   Call For Papers

		   1996 FEDERATED LOGIC CONFERENCE

			       FLoC'96

    July 27 - August 3, 1996, Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA


As part of its Special Year on Logic and Algorithms, DIMACS will host
the 1996 Federated Logic Conference (FLoC).  FLoC is modeled after the
successful Federated Computer Research Conference (FCRC), and brings
together synergetic conferences that apply logic to computer science.
The participating conferences are: Conference on Automated Deduction
(CADE), Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV), IEEE
Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS), and Conference on
Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA).

LICS and RTA will be held in parallel during the first four days of
FLoC.  CADE and CAV will be held during the last four days, with CADE
workshops running in parallel with the last day of LICS.  Plenary
events involving all the conferences are scheduled.

       CADE:    July 30 - August 3
       CAV:     July 31 - August 3
       LICS:    July 27 - July 30

Subject: a question 

Date: Wed, 18 Oct 1995 09:33:34 +0100
From: TONOLO@PDMAT1.MATH.UNIPD.IT

Dear Professors,

I wish to know if complete lattices with the following property have
been considered and named:

         h < sup a_i  ==>   h = sup( h : a_i)      (I use : for the binary meet)
for each h and each directed family {a_i | i\in I} of elements of the lattice.


Thanking for the attention, with my best regards

Alberto Tonolo

The condition is equivalent to binary meets distributing over directed
joins, and it's well known (e.g. Johnstone's "Stone Spaces" Lemma VII.4.1)
that this holds for all continuous lattices.

Posets that have finite meets and directed joins and this distributivity
have been called "preframes" by Banaschewski, so if you are genuinely
interested in complete lattices with preframe distributivity you might
plausibly call them complete preframes.

You have the meet-continuous lattices introduced in 1948 by G. Birkhoff
and O. Frink. The usual definition is, for each up-directed family {a_i}
and each h,h : sup a_i = sup h : a_i (in your notation). This is easily
seen to be equivalent. There is a lot known about them by now.

Why not START with Kelly-Street, Review of the elements of 2-categories,
Lecture Notes in Math. 420, 75-103? Then go on to some of Ross Street's
expository articles - I'm sure he will suggest some when he returns from
a holiday at the end of this week. However the article above contains some
beautiful stuff, and should be better known - you'ld probably find it fun
to read it yourself.

Subject: Re: "a question" 

Date: 19-OCT-1995 19:34:07.42
From: Fred E.J. Linton <FLINTON@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU>

Alberto Tonolo asks about complete lattices with the following property 
(I replace his meet-symbol ":" with the symbol "^" instead):

>            h < sup a_i  ==>  
>
>            h = sup( h ^ a_i)                 (*_h)
>
> for each h and each directed family {a_i | i in I} of elements of the lattice.

I can point out only that, in any lattice (complete 
or not) in which the family  a_i  (i in I)  has a sup, 
to require  (*_h)  for each  h < sup a_i  is the same as 
to require the distributivity  

	     h ^ sup a_i = sup (h ^ a_i)       (d_h)

for just all  h .  

Indeed, the relations  (d_h)  and  (*_h)  coincide, and are trivial, 
when  h < sup a_i ; and when  h = sup a_i  they not only coincide but
are tautologous.  In particular,  (d_h)  for all  h  guarantees  (*_h)
for  h < sup a_i ,  and  (*_h)  for  h < sup a_i  guarantees  (d_h)
at least for all  h  that are  <  or  =  to  sup a_i .

For general  h' , let  h = h' ^ sup a_i .  Then  either  h < sup a_i
or  h = sup a_i ; in either case,  (d_h)  holds.  To see that  (d_h')
holds as well, just calculate:
                                                                    
	since h = h' ^ sup a_i ,  either  h <  or  h = sup a_i  ;  

and, by  (*_h) ,

	h' ^ sup a_i = h = sup (h ^ a_i) = sup ((h' ^ sup a_i) ^ a_i) = 

	             = sup (h' ^ ((sup a_i) ^ a_i)) = sup (h' ^ a_i) .

In particular, *every*  h ^ (-)  will distribute through whatever joins
happen to satisfy  (*_h)  for  just all smaller  h  than the join; 
if the lattice is complete and satisfies the (*_h) condition for all
joins and all  h  smaller than them, it is a frame; and, I guess, if
I'm not utterly confused by what the term "continuous lattice" means,
if the lattice has directed joins and the (*_h) condition holds for all 
directed joins and all  h  smaller than them, then it's a continuous lattice 
(or, anyway, *every*  h ^ (-)  distributes through every directed join).  

Hope this helps.  And I'm sure someone will correct me if I've misunderstood
the meaning of "continuous lattice" :-) .

1) "continuous lattice" refers to complete lattices only, so the 
condition of existing directed sups is obsolete.

2) The equational characterisation of continuous lattices is directed 
sups distributing over *arbitrary* infs. As pointed out by John 
Isbell, the lattices referred to by Alberto Tonolo are known as "meet-
continuous".

Dear Alberto,

It would seem your property is implied by one form of continuity, I think
it is upper continuity.  I think algebraic lattices also have your property.

A semantics for shape
=====================

The basic observation behind shape theory is that most of the functors
F used to model data types share a common characteristic; they have a
cartesian natural transformation into a functor used to store
unstructured data. In the simplest case, the latter is the list (or
free monoid) functor:

	data: F => L

The main result of this paper is that in a locos (an extensive
category with all finite limits and lists) all functors shapely over
lists are closed under the formation of initial algebras. The proof is
constructive - simply build a parser for the initial algebra,
using the existing lists and pullbacks.


Data categories and functors
============================

The functors which are cartesian over lists are good for handling
first order structures, but they are not closed under exponentiation,
and so are inadequate for higher-order types. This defect is remedied
by changing the functor used to store data from lists to a *position
functor* given by an object of positions P. Such a functor maps an
object A to the object

	P --> A+1 .

A *data functor* is a functor F with a given cartesian transformation
to such a position functor. Now, for any object X the functor which
maps A to the object

	X --> FA

is also a position functor, with object of positions XxP.

The key result about data functors is that every natural
transformation between two such is given by a uniform, or parametric
natural transformation. More precisely, if F is a data functor with
object of positions P, and G is a data functor, then every natural
transformation

	F ==> G

is determined by a morphism 

	F1 --> GP

This fact makes the data functors suitable for modelling higher types.


Covariant Types
===============

The data categories, in which the theory of data functors is
developed, include the usual semantic categories, such as Sets, and
bottomless c.p.o.'s. However, Reynolds proved that "Polymorphism is
not set-theoretic" by showing that the second-order polymorphic lambda
calculus (system F) has no set-theoretic models. This leads us to ask
what kind of polymorphism is modelled by the data functors. This leads
to the covariant type system in which function types are replaced by
*transformation types*. The system is strong enough to capture the
usual polymorphism of lists and trees, while still having
set-theoretic models. Thus,

	Polymorphism *can* be set-theoretic


Polynomial Polymorphism
=======================

As a sub-system of F, the covariant types do not capture
functoriality.  For shape (or functorial) polymorphism to make sense,
there must be a polymorphic algorithm for evaluating the action of
functors on morphisms, i.e. a polymorphic map. Such an algorithm was
first developed in the type system P2, as described in the following
paper.


Type-free term reduction for covariant types
============================================

A generic algorithm for mapping requires the detection of the data to
which the mapped function must be applied. One method of doing this is
to *tag* the data using a single system of tags appropriate for all
the functors under discussion. A naive approach leads to the tagged
types of this paper.


Functorial types
================

Current work aims to have functors represented directly by types so
that, for example, composition of functors is a primitive operation on
types. This is intended to extend the notion of category theory as a
programming technique.


Shape analysis for parallel computing
=====================================


While shape polymorphism allows us to "ignore" the shape, shape
analysis uses detailed shape information to improve errr detection and
compilation. This is particularly important in parallel programming,
where the shape of the data structures, and their distribution, are
central concerns. This paper presents a survey of the issues, and a
computational paradigm, that will be developed by the 

	Algorithms and Languages Group
