Subject: limits of finite monoids 

Date: Sat, 2 Sep 95 20:22:16 EDT
From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

Surely it must be known that a topological monoid, compact, hausdorff
and zero dimensional is a filtered limit of finite monoids.  Can someone
supply a reference?

Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xy-pic version 3.1 released! 

Date: Tue, 5 Sep 1995 22:59:43 +0200
From: Kristoffer H. Rose <kris@diku.dk>

Dear category theorist,

Please find enclosed a copy of the TRAILER for a new version of Xy-pic.
I hope you will find it useful.

Sincerely,
            Kristoffer H. Rose

=======================================================================
     ANNOUNCING the Xy-pic version 3.1 DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE
=======================================================================

This is to announce a RELEASE of my DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE:

			       Xy-pic 3.1

This is a maintenance release where many little problems of the major
release of Xy-pic 3.0 (from July) have been solved.

Xy-pic is a package for typesetting a variety of graphs and diagrams
with TeX.  Xy-pic works with most formats (including LaTeX, AMS-LaTeX,
AMS-TeX, and plain TeX), in particular Xy-pic is provided as a LaTeX2e
`supported package' (following the `CTAN LaTeX2e bundle' standard).

Further details on the package are in the README file of the
distribution.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
				  NEWS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic version 3 is a thorough rewrite of the prior major version,
version 2 (last version 2 release was release 2.6; several beta-test
releases of version 3, numbered 2.7-2.12, were made available to users).
However, full backwards compatibility is maintained (except for the
unavoidable but fully documented obscure cases).

Release 3.1 fixes the following problems of release 3.0:

* Improved framing and curve code (in particular dashed curves).

* More & improved DVI driver support (includes the em-TeX driver)!

* User's Guide now available as hypertext (HTML)!

and many other little fixes in code & documentation (all described in
the ChangeLog file in the source distribution).

Thanks to Robert Kiessling, Antonio Possolo, Jvrg Knappen, Michael J
Healy, Clemens Beckstein, Michel Goossens, Dierdrik Wiersma, Dan
Christensen, and Vladimiro Sassone, for your bug reports !

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic was created by Kristoffer H. Rose, DIKU, U of Copenhagen.  Most
of the rewrite was accomplished in collaboration with Ross Moore while
visiting Macquarie U, Sydney (Jan-May 1994), supported by the Australian
Research Council, Macquarie University, and using donated DEC equipment.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: kuvio.tex - diagrams for dvips users 

Date: Wed, 6 Sep 95 14:27:49 -0700
From: Anders Svensson <svensson@math.ubc.ca>

Since Kris has just announced a new version of XY-pic, allow me to offer up
my own diagram package for users of dvips.

The macros in kuvio.tex use PostScript embedded in \special control sequences
to rotate arrows from the horizontal. Features include:

 1. Input uses an alignment syntax not unlike some other packages.

 2. Rigid and flexible grids for vertex placement. (Warning for new users:
    \Diagram \endDiagram and \Dg \endDg behave quite differently.)

 3. Diagram compilation for improved performance.

 4. Diagram types allow one to customize the setup for a named class of
    diagrams.

 5. Almost every choice made by the macros in kuvio.tex is adjustable by
    the user.

 6. A labelling scheme for typesetting material on top of diagrams or
    included PostScript figures.

 7. Arrows can be attached to points on other arrows.

 8. Since arrows are rotated from the horizontal, anything which can
    be typeset horizontally can be used as an arrow in a diagram.
    New arrow types are easily defined. (For those who care about such
    things, there is a predefined type, To, whose arrowhead is that of
    \rightarrow .)

 9. General purpose macros for rotation, reflection and framing.

For anyone who's interested, the following files can be found at
/pub/svensson/kuvio:ftp.math.ubc.ca.

   kuvio-p209+245.tar.gz           kuvio.tex plus documentation in both source
                                   and PostScript (letter size) form.

   kuvio-p209+245A4.tar.gz         kuvio.tex plus documentation in both source
                                   and PostScript (A4) form.

   kuvio-p209+245ps.tar.gz         kuvio.tex plus documentation in PostScript
                                   (letter size) form only.

   kuvio-p209+245A4ps.tar.gz       kuvio.tex plus documentation in PostScript

                                   form only. Not worth the effort unless
                                   you already know what you're in for.

   kuvio-p209.tar.gz               kuvio.tex sans documentation.

   examples.ps.gz                  Teasers from the documentation - the
   examples-A4.ps.gz               table of contents plus 12 pages of
                                   example diagrams.

As far as I know, everything works so if you run into any trouble don't
hesitate to contact me.

Subject: LICS'96 Call for Papers 

Date: Wed, 13 Sep 95 12:30 EDT
From: Amy Felty <felty@research.att.com>


[A postscript version of the call for papers is available via the LICS
 web page at http://www.research.att.com/lics/, and via anonymous ftp
 from research.att.com, directory /dist/lics.]

[Our apologies if you receive multiple copies of this announcement.]


                   Eleventh Annual IEEE Symposium on
                      LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
           July 27-30, 1996, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA

                           CALL FOR PAPERS

The LICS Symposium aims to attract original papers of high quality on
theoretical and practical topics in computer science that relate to
logic in a broad sense, including algebraic, categorical and
topological approaches.

Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest include: abstract
data types, automated deduction, categorical models, concurrency,
constraint programming, constructive mathematics, database theory,
domain theory, finite model theory, hybrid systems, logics of
knowledge, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic, logical
aspects of computational complexity, logics in artificial
intelligence, logic programming, modal and temporal logics, model
checking, program logic and semantics, rewriting, logical aspects of
symbolic computing, software specification, type systems,
verification.

Paper submission: Send 12 copies of an extended abstract (not a full
paper) to the program chair to be received by December 13, 1995.  This
deadline is firm; late submissions will not be considered.  Authors
without access to copiers may submit a single copy.  Authors will be
notified of acceptance or rejection by March 7, 1996.  Accepted papers
in a specified format for the proceedings will be due May 7, 1996.

The first page of the extended abstract should include the title of
the paper, names and affiliations of authors, a brief synopsis, and
the contact author's name, address, phone number, fax number, and
email address, if available.

The extended abstract may not exceed 10 typed pages in no less than
11-point font, with a line spacing of no less than 1.5.  It must be in
English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee
to assess the merits of the paper.  It should begin with a succinct
statement of the issues, a summary of the main results, and a brief
explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference, all
phrased for the non-specialist.  References and comparisons with
related work should be included.  Technical development directed to
the specialist should follow.  Submissions departing significantly
from these guidelines risk rejection.

Dual submissions: The results must be unpublished and not submitted
for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia
or workshops (see exception below).  All authors of accepted papers
will be expected to sign copyright release forms.  One author of each
accepted paper will be expected to present the paper at the
conference.

As a one-time experiment, submissions to LICS this year can also be
submitted to the Israeli Symposium on the Theory of Computing and
Systems (ISTCS), provided this is clearly indicated on the cover page
of the submission.  If the paper is accepted to both LICS and ISTCS,
then the paper will be included in the LICS proceedings, and the ISTCS
proceedings will include only a 1-page abstract with a pointer to the
LICS proceedings.

IMPORTANT DATES:
	Submission deadline: December 13, 1995
	Notification: March 7, 1996
	Final papers due: May 7, 1996
	Conference: July 27-30, 1996

The symposium is part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC),
July 27-August 3, 1996, being hosted by the Center for Discrete
Mathematics and Computer Science, Rutgers University, as part of its
Special Year on Logic and Algorithms.  In addition to LICS, FLoC
includes the following related conferences: Rewriting Techniques and
Applications (RTA), Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE), and
Computer-Aided Verification (CAV).  LICS and RTA will be held in
parallel during the first four days of FLoC.  CADE and CAV will be
held during the last four days, with CADE workshops running in
parallel with the last day of LICS.  Plenary events involving all the
conferences are scheduled.  For further information on FLoC and the
participating conferences, see the FLoC home page at
  http://www.research.att.com/lics/floc/.
Information about the Special Year can be found in
  http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/.

The symposium is sponsored by the IEEE Technical Committee on
Mathematical Foundations of Computing in cooperation with the
Association for Symbolic Logic, the European Association for
Theoretical Computer Science, and the Association for Computing
Machinery.

Kleene Award for Best Student Paper: An award of $500, in honor of the
late S.C. Kleene, will be given to the best paper, as judged by the
program committee, written solely by one or more students.  A
submission is eligible if all authors are full-time students at the
time of submission.  This should be indicated in the submission
letter.  The program committee may decline to make the award or may
split it among several papers.

quality on theoretical and practical topics in computer science that
relate to logic in a broad sense, including algebraic, categorical and
topological approaches.

Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest include: {\em
abstract data types, automated deduction, categorical models,
concurrency, constraint programming, constructive mathematics,
database theory, domain theory, finite model theory, hybrid systems,
logics of knowledge, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic,
logical aspects of computational complexity, logics in artificial
intelligence, logic programming, modal and temporal logics, model
checking, program logic and semantics, rewriting, logical aspects of
symbolic computing, software specification, type systems,
verification.}

{\bf Paper submission:} Send 12 copies of an extended abstract (not a
full paper) to the {\bf program chair} to be {\bf received} by {\bf
December 13, 1995}.  {\sl This deadline is firm; late submissions will
not be considered.}  Authors without access to copiers may submit a
single copy.  Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by
March 7, 1996.  Accepted papers in a specified format for the
proceedings will be due May 7, 1996.

The first page of the extended abstract should include the title of
the paper, names and affiliations of authors, a brief synopsis, and
the contact author's name, address, phone number, fax number, and
email address, if available.

The extended abstract may not exceed 10 typed pages in no less than
11-point font, with a line spacing of no less than 1.5.  It must be in
English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee
to assess the merits of the paper.  It should begin with a succinct
statement of the issues, a summary of the main results, and a brief
explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference, all
phrased for the non-specialist.  References and comparisons with
related work should be included.  Technical development directed to
the specialist should follow.  Submissions departing significantly
from these guidelines risk rejection.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xy-pic version 3.2 released! 

Date: Tue, 19 Sep 1995 22:16:46 +0200
From: Kristoffer H. Rose <kris@diku.dk>

Dear category theorist,

Please find enclosed a copy of the TRAILER for a new version of Xy-pic.
I hope you will find it useful.

Sincerely,
            Kristoffer H. Rose

=======================================================================
     ANNOUNCING the Xy-pic version 3.2 DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE
=======================================================================

This is to announce a RELEASE of the DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE:

			       Xy-pic 3.2

This is a maintenance release where a few more bugs of the previous
major release of Xy-pic 3 (from July) have been eliminated.

Xy-pic is a package for typesetting a variety of graphs and diagrams
with TeX.  Xy-pic works with most formats (including LaTeX, AMS-LaTeX,
AMS-TeX, and plain TeX), in particular Xy-pic is provided as a LaTeX2e
`supported package' (following the `CTAN LaTeX2e bundle' standard).

Further details on the package are in the README file of the
distribution.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
				  NEWS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic version 3 is a thorough rewrite of the prior major version,
version 2 (last version 2 release was release 2.6; several beta-test
releases of version 3, numbered 2.7-2.12, were made available to users).
However, full backwards compatibility is maintained (except for the
unavoidable but fully documented obscure cases).

Release 3.2 fixes the following relative to release 3.1:

* Arrow labels now typeset using the correct style in all cases.

* Circles in old-style diagrams now work again...

* PostScript pattern support now compatible with GhostScript.

as well as several minor fixes in code & documentation (all described in
the ChangeLog file in the source distribution).

Thanks to J|rgen Koslowski, Young U. Ryu, Fred T. Krogh, Clemens
Beckstein, and Ralf Gaertner, for your bug reports!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: braided monoidal categories 

Date: Thu, 21 Sep 1995 12:47:24 -0700
From: john baez <baez@math.ucr.edu>

I am posting the following for James Dolan, jdolan@math.ucr.edu:

is there any well-known way to "turn a braided monoidal category
into a simplicial set"?

in particular, have you ever heard of anything along the following
lines:

given a braided monoidal category x, get a simplicial set x# as
follows:

  there's only one 0-simplex.
  there's only one 1-simplex.
  the 2-simplexes are the objects of x.
  the 3-simplexes with 2-faces (in order) a,b,c,d are morphisms

                              a@c -> d@b.

  the 4-simplexes with 3-faces (in order)

                                  k
                              a@d -> g@b

                                  l
                              a@e -> h@c

                                  m
                              b@f -> i@c

                                  n
                              d@f -> j@e

                                  o
                              g@i -> j@h

  are commutative diagrams


                  k@f            g@m            o@c
                   ->    g@b@f    ->    g@i@c    ->

          a@d@f                                        j@h@c

                   ->    a@j@e    ->    j@a@e    ->    
                  a@n            *@e            j@l


  where "*" is the braiding.
  the simplexes of dimension 5 and higher are "co-skeletal".

  the degeneracy maps are, well, i didn't try to work out what they
  should be yet; maybe it's obvious what all of them should be or
  maybe it isn't, but at worst you could just have x# be a "simplicial
  set without degeneracy".




there's obviously a relationship between the form of the data
constituting a 3- or 4-simplex here and the yang-baxter equation (at
least it's obvious if you can decipher my notation), but i'm not quite
sure if the relationship is such that what i'm describing is just a
completely obvious re-statement of the usual relationship between
simplicial geometry and the yang-baxter equation.

i'd also like to know of a nice description of some extra structure on
the simplicial set x# that would amount to precisely the ability to
reconstruct the braided monoidal category x from it.  (that's not
quite a perfectly well-defined problem the way i just stated it,
though.)

of course a description of the general relationship between
simplicial sets and some sort of "tri-categories" more general than
braided monoidal categories would be just as good.

Date: Fri, 22 Sep 1995 22:16:09 +1000 (EST)
From: Ross Street <street@macadam.mpce.mq.edu.au>

This is a response to the Dolan/Baez question
under hard circumstances. I am at Oberwolfach
and the delay on the computer via Macquarie University
is extreme.

In fact, in my talks here at the Descent Theory conference I have
described how to construct a descent n-category
of a cosimplicial n-category. On the way I defined the nerve of any
"file". A 1-file is a category, a 2-file is 2-category,
a 3-file is a Gray-category in the sense of
Gordon-Power-Street.
A 1-object, 1-arrow 3-file is a 
braided strict monoidal category. It is also
possible to define the nerve of a tricategory;
a 1 object, 1 arrow tricategory is a general
braided monoidal category.
Actually, I like to distinguish the
braided monoidal category V from the
tricategory which I think of as the 
double suspension of V.

The nerve of the double suspension gives the 2-fold
delooping of the nerve of V as a 
mere category.

I have written a bunch of notes for this
conference where this is all spelt out
pretty well.
There is also a hint in the published paper

JW Duskin
The Azumaya complex of a commutative ring
SLNM 1348 (1988) 107-117

See page 116 where there is an explanation of a 
suggestion from me.

The point about interpreting the 4-simplex in
a tricategory (or Gray-category)
is that the pentagonal condition
becomes a hexagon since there
is a middle-4-interchange needed in the middle
of the short path around the hexagon. Since Gray-categories don't admit a unique
horizontal composition of 2-cell, an extra edge is introduced pentagon.


Bye for now.
Ross

Subject: pseudonatural transformations 

Date: Fri, 22 Sep 95 16:57:49 BST
From: john baez <baez@math.ucr.edu>

Is there a good reference somewhere for the definition of
a "pseudonatural transformation" between strict 2-functors between
2-categories, and of a "modification" between such pseudonatural
transformations?  In Springer Lecture Notes 420, Kelly and Street
define lax natural transformations between strict 2-functors, 
and (apparently following Benabou) modifications between strict natural
transformations.  The definitions I want are hopefully straightforward
modifications of these, but I don't actually know if anyone has given
them anywhere.  Perhaps it's up to me?

From: David Yetter <dyetter@math.ksu.edu>

Regarding the construction of a simplicial set from a bmc:

	This is a special case of constructing the nerve of a tri-category.

	A monoidal category is a bicategory with one object.
	A monoid in monoidal categories is a braided monoidal category.
	A braided monoidal category is a tri-category with one object
and one map.

From: Marco Grandis <grandis@dima.unige.it>

As John Baez points out, a "pseudonatural transformation between strict
2-functors between 2-categories" is just the obvious particular case of a
lax natural transformation; the paper by Kelly-Street he refers too, in
SLNM 420, provides a general, coherent terminology for relaxed
2-categorical notions, as well as references to their earlier appearences.
I think it already provides the reference he is looking for.

The following paper might contain things connected with his interests. A
definition of the precise cases he is interested in, pseudonatural
transformations and their modifications, is written out in S 0.6

Subject: pseudonatural transformations 

Date: Wed, 27 Sep 1995 11:58:13 +0100
From: Prof R. Brown <mas010@bangor.ac.uk>



In the groupoid case a theory of higher homotopies is written out in terms
of the monoidal 
closed structures on the categories of \omega-groupoids (= 
``cubical'' \omega-groupoids with connections, in some other terminology) 
and the equivalent category of crossed complexes in the paper
R.  BROWN and  P.J. HIGGINS, ``Tensor products and homotopies for 
$\omega$-groupoids and crossed complexes'', {\em J. Pure Appl.
Alg.}, 47 (1987) 1-33. 

In these categories, we easily deal with ``lax equivalences'' as 
``homotopies'', i.e. maps C \otimes I \to D, where I is the usual unit 
interval groupoid. Since these categories are equivalent to that of
``globular'' infinity- (omega?)-groupoids, (Brown and Higgins, CTGDC, 1981) 
one gets a corresponding theory there, but without such explicit formulae. 
So I suppose it is not quite so clear this theory extends the 
lax 2-groupoid theory, but it seems highly likely. 

There are quite a few recent applications of these methods, for example to 
coherent and to equivariant homotopy theory. See for example 

R. Brown,  M. Golasinski, T.Porter and A.P.Tonks), ``On function
spaces of equivariant maps and the equivariant homotopy theory
of crossed complexes''. 

A.P. Tonks, ``Theory and applications of crossed complexes'', 
Bangor PhD Thesis, 1993. 

I expect that recent work of Crans, Steiner, Street et al (not all 
together) gives a category version of 
these groupoid formulations for the omega-category case, but  
for the cubical version (preferably with connections?) it all seems clear,
since 
one uses cubes to define tensor.

Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic

59th Meeting -- Second Announcement


The 59th meeting of the seminar will be held at the University of
Edinburgh's Computer Science Department over the weekend of 7-8
October 1995. The meeting is dedicated to Peter Freyd in celebration
of his 60th birthday. Peter of course will attend. The seminar
welcomes talks using or addressing category theory or logic, either
explicitly or implicitly, in the study of any aspect of mathematics or
science.

Proceedings will begin on Saturday at 9:30 am in Room 2511, the James
Clerk Maxwell Building, the King's Buildings (the science campus of
Edinburgh University), when we will finalise the timetable and start
talks. A light lunch will be provided each day in the adjoining room,
as well as coffee and biscuits.

We plan to publish a proceedings of the meeting as a special issue of
the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, dedicated to Peter.
Obviously, it is impractical for many scientists from outside western
Europe to attend the meeting, so we will allow submissions to the
proceedings by people who cannot attend but would like to participate.

Here is a current list of speakers and titles:

Philip Scott    Linear Lauchli Semantics
Mamuka Jibladze A Presentation of the Initial Lift-Algebra
Peter Johnstone Cartesian Functors Between Toposes

Mike Fourman    Classifying Cardinalities

Subject: Braided monoidal 2-categories 

Date: Fri, 29 Sep 1995 16:27:23 -0700
From: john baez <baez@math.ucr.edu>

Martin Neuchl and I have written a paper entitled "Higher-dimensional
algebra I: braided monoidal 2-categories".  In it, we begin with
a brief sketch of what is known and conjectured concerning braided
monoidal 2-categories and their relevance to 4d topological quantum
field theories and 2-tangles.  Then we give concise definitions of
semistrict monoidal and braided monoidal 2-categories, and show how
these may be unpacked to give definitions similar to, but not quite
the same as, those given by Kapranov and Voevodsky.  Finally, we 
describe how to construct a semistrict braided monoidal 2-category
as the "center" of a semistrict monoidal 2-category, in a manner
analogous to the construction of a braided monoidal category as
the center (or "quantum double") of a monoidal category.  As a corollary
this yields a strictification theorem for braided monoidal 2-categories.

This paper is available by anonymous ftp to math.ucr.edu.  It is
the file bm2cat in the directory baez.  It is in uuencoded, compressed
form, because it is 51 pages with lots of pictures.  To print it,
first save the file as "bm2cat" and do "uudecode bm2cat".  This
should produce a file "bm2cat.dvi.Z".  Then do "uncompress bm2cat.dvi.Z".
This should produce a file "bm2cat.dvi," which you can print out
in the way you usually print dvi files.
