Subject: Re: composition of enriched functors 

Date: Mon, 2 Jan 95 09:34:16 +1100
From: Max Kelly <kelly_m@maths.su.oz.au>

David Yetter, in his query, seems to be making heavy weather of the composition
of enriched functors. The composite of F:A --> B and G:B --> C is given on
objects by GFa, while its "effect on maps" is the composite of the effects of F
and of G as in  A(a,a') ------> B(Fa,Fa') -----> C(GFa,GFa'). That is all.

 There is further a composition of profunctors (also called bimodules, or just
modules), given by an evident co-end formula. Now every functor F determines a
profunctor F*, where F*(a,b) is B(Fa,b); and the calculation David refers to
(which is a simple application of the Yoneda isomorphism) is just the verification
that (GF)* is canonically isomorphic to (G*)(F*). Of course this holds, in
particular, for C-linear categories.

 New-Year greetings to all - Max Kelly.

This follows from the enriched Yoneda Lemma. The setting is as follows.
It is tensor product of (bi)modules which is given by the coend formula.
Modules (= profunctors = distributors) between V-categories are the arrows
for a bicategory Mod(V) with this tensor product as composition. Each
V-functor  F  becomes a module in two ways: F_* and F^*. The latter
involves the Hom(F(a),c) as required by David. Each process gives a
locally fully faithful embedding of V-Cat in V-Mod (Yoneda's Lemma)
with appropriate variances. Moreover,  F^*  is right adjoint to F_* in
the bicategory Mod(V).

2.  Linked to that web page is my web page and linked to my web page

			Tensor and Linear Time

Introduction

Quite simply, serial composition is

	<---   <---

while parallel composition = tensor is 

	<---

	<---

even though we will run both sequentially (section 4.6).  Tensor,
rather than product, not only provides more models [Huwig 82], but may
be necessary at tier 0 in order to avoid the diagonal bug (section
4.6).  Roughly, tier 0 is what may go inside loops, while tier 1 is
what is defined by loops (section 4.1).  By the way, 0-ary serial
composition = the identities, while 0-ary parallel composition = the
unit.

The main text consists of sections 1. Almost Equational Specification,
2. Tensor and System T, 3. Comprehensions and Tiers, 4. Linear Time,
and 5. The Linear Time Hierarchy.  Section 4 characterizes the linear
time functions, using ideas from [Bellantoni-Cook 92, Bloch 92,
Leivant-Marion 92], and provides a formal system for them.  Section 5
characterizes, improving [Wrathall 78], the linear time hierarchy
relations. (These are the Delta_0 relations [H'ajek-Pudl'ak 93, Woods
86].)  Section 1, using ideas from [Makkai 94, Ad'amek-Rosick'y 94],
explains the almost equational specification which we use throughout.
It is based on 2 layers of restricted equational specification:
sketches and orthogonality.  Section 2 specifies the idealized, but
unfeasible, recursion of G"odel's system T, while section 3 provides a
means, namely comprehensions and tiers, to attain feasibility.
Technical issues have been pushed to the appendices, which are
A. Sketches as Presheaves, B. Initial Models, C. Coherence, D. Linear
Implication, E. Cotensor, F. Gluing, and G. Turing machines.  The main
text is hopefully generally readable with perhaps a few glances at say
[Barr-Wells 90, 85].

We have used latex2e, xy-pic, and auc-tex.

It's not true.

I expect there are already lots of counterexamples amongst non-trivial
pointless locales, but here's something more straightforward.

Let D be a non-trivial locale with no global points (global point = locale
map from 1 to D) and let D' be its lift (or localification), which has a
new bottom point adjoined - by adjoining a new top to its frame. D' has
only one global point (the new bottom) and so the specialization order on
global points is discrete. However, we have two generalized points of D' at
stage D' itself (locale maps from D' to D'), namely the generic point id:
D' -> D' and the bottom _|_: D' -> 1 -> D', and they are distinct with _|_
<= id.

     Hi.  Coming in using ftp I don't find anything I can "get"

   Perhaps I should learn something about "crtc.html".  Can you
   suggest what command I should begin with (using what's essentially

   line ((to another NeXT on my desk)) ) ?  I've been trying

Dear Art Stone

So my directions on

<li> <a href=ftp://triples.math.mcgill.ca/ctrc.html>

were too implicit.  To use ftp rather than say mosaic

1.  Do anonymous ftp to triples.math.mcgill.ca

2.  get ctrc.html

By the way, it's not according to the French spelling or the Canadian
version of the American FCC, but rather the English spelling `Category
Theory Research Center'.

3.  Read that J. Otto is at pub/otto/otto.html

<li> <a href="pub/otto/otto.html"> J. Otto</a>

4.  cd pub/otto and then get otto.html

5.  Read that the new paper is at c-docs/tensor.ps.gz

New papers on complexity doctrines.
<ul>
<li> <a href="c-docs/tensor.ps.gz">
Tensor and Liner Time</a> (42 pages).  Submitted to the proceedings of
the workshop on logic and computational complexity.
</ul>

6.  cd c-docs and get tensor.ps.gz

7.  If you don't have gunzip, get it from say the GNU directory on
gatekeeper as pointed to by otto.html.

<li> <a href=http://gatekeeper.dec.com:80/pub/>
Gatekeeper.</a>

Well actually that one won't work for ftp.  This one will

<li> <a href=ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/>
GNU</a>

Or get someone to setup a web previewer, say mosaic, and its
utilities, especially gunzip, gs, and ghostview.  O'Reilly has a nice
book on mosaic.

<li> <a href=http://nearnet.gnn.com/bus/ora/index.html>

So, just as .bib's are useful even without bibtex, .html's are useful
without mosaic, lynx, or WWW.  On the other hand, newer software can
make guru mumbo jumbo a no-brainer.

Subject: algebraically compact categories 

Date: Tue, 10 Jan 1995 11:05:10 -0500
From: Peter Freyd <pjf@saul.cis.upenn.edu>

When I first introduced the notions of algebraically complete
categories (every endo-functor has an initial algebra) and
algebraically compact categories (every endo-functor has an initial
algebra naturally isomorphic to a terminal co-algebra) I thought that
such things would exist in the classical foundations only in
degenerate form. It was a surprise when I noticed that the categories
of countable sets and of countably dimensioned vector spaces are
algebraically complete. I'm now surprised by:
  
  The category of separable Hilbert spaces and linear operators of
  bound at most  1  is algebraically compact.

As in the earlier cases one doesn't really need the controlling
cardinal number to be aleph-naught. To avoid using the axiom of choice
one can state the more general result by taking an arbitrary Hilbert
space  A  and defining  *A*  by:
  Objects of  *A*:  all those Hilbert spaces that can be isometrically
       embedded in  A;
  Maps of  *A*: all linear operators thereon of bound at most  1. 

Then:
         *A*  is algebraically compact.

The theorem holds for both the real and complex cases.

In the proof I use the surprising (to me) fact that in the categories
in question every half-invertible map has a _unique_ half-inverse.
(That is, every map has at most one left-inverse and one right-
inverse.) All the other examples from nature that I can think of are
categories in which the only half-invertibles are invertible. Are
there others?

Subject: Hilbert space proof 

Date: Sat, 14 Jan 1995 07:47:49 -0500
From: Peter Freyd <pjf@saul.cis.upenn.edu>

On request:

Theorem:

  The category of separable Hilbert spaces and linear operators of
  bound at most  1  is algebraically compact.

More generally,

Theorem:

  Let  A  be a Hilbert space.  Let  *A*  be the category whose objects
  are all Hilbert spaces that can be isometrically embedded in  A  and
  whose maps are all linear operators therebetween of bound at most 1.
  Then  *A*  is algebraically compact.

(The axiom of choice says that the objects of  *A*  can be described
as all Hilbert spaces of (orthonormal) dimension bounded by a given
cardinal.) The proofs work for both the real and complex cases.

For the proof we'll need a few lemmas about  *A*  and its
endofunctors. First note that any isometric embedding  B -> C  is
a retract with the adjoint operator  C -> B  serving as its right-
inverse. Left to the reader is the surprising fact (to me) that right-
inverses are unique. So are left-inverses. That is, in  *A*  every map
has at most one right-inverse and one left-inverse and all left-
inverses are isometric embeddings and all right-inverses are
orthogonal projections.

Because any functor preserves the existence of right-inverses we may
conclude that any given endofunctor, T, carries isometric embeddings
to isometric embeddings. For convenience we'll replace  T  with a
naturally equivalent functor that is invariant on the lattice of
subobjects of  A  (that is, the subcategory of all closed subspaces of
A  and all inclusion maps therebetween). First choose a single
isometric embedding  TA -> A.  For each  A' contained in  A  define
T'A'  to be the image of TA' -> TA -> A  where  TA' -> TA  is  T
applied to the inclusion map  A' -> A. Let  TA' -> T'A' be the obvious
isomorphism. For all objects, B, not contained in  A  define  T'B  to
be  TB  and  TB -> T'B  to be the identity map. Define  T' to be the
unique endofunctor that turns this collection of isomorphisms into a
natural equivalence. For an inclusion map  A' -> A  we have that
T'A' -> T'A  is an inclusion map. And from that we may conclude that
any inclusion map between subobjects of  A  is carried by  T' to an
inclusion map.

We'll drop the dash-mark on  T  and notationally assume that our given
functor preserves the lattice of subobjects of  A. At this point it is
clear (a la Tarski) what the initial T-algebra must be: any
endofunctor on a complete lattice has a minimal fixed point, indeed,
to domain theorists (a CS term) it is clear how to prove it to be the
initial T-algebra: start by using the bottom-up construction for the
minimal fixed-point for  T  as it operates on the lattice of
subobjects of  A. Define an ordinal sequence of subspaces of  A  as
follows: for a limit ordinal 'a, take  F['a]  to be the supremum of
the previous values; for a successor ordinal  1+'b  take  F[1+'b]  to
be  T(F['b]). Note that for the limit ordinal  0  we have that  F[0]
is the trivial (one-element) subspace.  And note that for all other
limit ordinals, 'a, we have that  F['a]  is the closure of the union
of the previous values. By an inductive argument this sequence is an
increasing sequence (but, of course, not forever strictly increasing):
for a limit ordinal 'a, we have that F['b] < F['a]  for all  'b < 'a 
(using  <  for the containment sign) hence  T(F['b]) < T(F['a])  that
is, F[1+'b] < F[1+'a]  for all 'b < 'a  and the construction of  F['a]
forces F['a] < T(F['a]) = F[1+'a]; for a successor ordinal  1+'b  we
may (inductively) assume that  F['b] < F[1+'b]  hence
T(F['b]) < T(F[1+'b]), that is, F[1+'b] < F[1+1+'b]. 

The sequence can not forever be strictly increasing. It stabilizes at
a value  F.  We take  'c  as the first limit ordinal such that
F = F['c].  We need that  F  is not just the supremum of the
constructing sequence as defined in the lattice but its colimit as
defined in the entire category. Actually we need the general fact that
for any limit ordinal 'a  it is the case that  F['a]  is the colimit
of the ordinal diagram of previous values. The proof is straigh-
forward using again the fact that the maps in the category are of
bound at most  1.)

Given a  T-algebra  b:TB -> B  we must construct a map  x:F -> B  so
that
         F
    Tx /   \ x
      TB -> B
         b          (add downward arrowheads).

We define, inductively, a sequence of maps  x['b]:F['b] -> B  such
that
           x['b]                         T(x['b])     b
     F['b] -----> B  =  F['b] -> F[1+'b] --------> FB -> B

where the unlabeled map is the inclusion map. For successor-ordinals
define  x[1+'b]  as
                     T(x['b])     b
             F[1+'b] --------> FB -> B.

The inductive verification that

             x[1+'b]                             T(x[1+'b])     b
     F[1+'b] -------> B  =  F[1+'b] -> F[1+1+'b] ----------> FB -> B

is straight-forward diagram chasing.

For limit-ordinals define  x['a]:F['a] -> B  using the fact that F['a]
is a colimit of the previous values. For the verification of

           x['a]                         T(x['a])     b
     F['a] -----> B  =  F['a] -> F[1+'a] --------> FB -> B

it suffices to verify, for each  'b < 'a, that

               x['a]                                T(x['a])     b
F['b] -> F['a] -----> B = F['b] -> F['a] -> F[1+'a] --------> FB -> B

where, just as before, each unlabeled arrow is an inclusion map. This
follows, inductively, from the two equations

                  x['a]              x['b]
   F['b] -> F['a] -----> B  =  F['b] -----> B,   and

   F['b] -> F['a] -> F[1+'a]  =  F['b] -> F[1+'b] -> F[1+'a]

where the last map (still an inclusion map) is the result of applying
T  to the inclusion map from  F['b]  to  F['a].

The uniqueness can be verified, inductively, for each 'b.
Alternatively, given a possibly different solution  y:F -> B, let
A' be the equalizer of  x  and  y  using the standard construction:
A' is the closed subspace of points on which  x  and  y  agree. It
follows that  T(A')  is contained in  A', that is, A' is a "prefixed
point" of  T.  But -- as is clear from the top-down construction --
minimal fixed points are automatically minimal prefixed points and  F
must be contained in  A'.

We have shown that  T  has an initial algebra (that is, the category
is algebraically complete). Since the category is self-dual (via the
adjoint-operator construction) it follows that  T  also has a final
co-algebra (that is, the category is algebraically co-complete). But
for compactness we need the two to be naturally isomorphic. We have
reduced to the case that the structure map on the initial algebra is
the identity map which means that the naturally isomorphic co-algebra
is given by the same identity map. That is, we must show for every
b:B -> TB  the existence of a unique  x:B -> F  such that
(add downward arrowheads)                     b
                                            B -> TB
                                           x \  / Tx
                                               F.

F is not just the colimit of the ordinal sequence of inclusion maps,
it's the limit of the ordinal sequence of their adjoint operators, the
orthogonal projections. The comments at the very beginning, that  T
necessarily preserves the unique right-inverses, says that this
ordinal sequence of orthogonal projections has all the requisite
properties for the (dual) of the proof we've just seen. Done.

Having done all this I must now note that my original purpose for
algebraic compactness has been frustrated: the fact that contravariant
functors and mixed-variance functors have minimal invariant objects
was already evident for this category. I'm refering to the general
theorem that given any algebraically compact category and  "sesqui"-
endofunctor, TXY, contravariant on  X, covariant on Y, there's a
T-invariant object, that is, an object  F  together with an
isomorphism from  TFF  to  F; indeed there is a _minimal_ T-invariant
object, that is, one that appears uniquely as a natural retract of
every T-invariant object. The trouble is that if we replace  TXY  with
TX'Y,  where  X'  denotes the adjoint-operator functor (which, note,
is the identity operation on objects) then it's easy to see that the
intial algebra of  TX'Y  is as desired. That is, algebraic
completeness is enough when in the presence of an anti-involution that
fixes identity maps.

The paper was, if I recall correctly, transmitted by guess who.  Actually,
Peter asked me in 1990 when I was leave at Penn if this were true.
The paper is also available for ftp (don't tell North-Holland).
I haven't studied Peter's argument, so I don't know how much it differs
from mine.  Actually, I haven't look at mine in several years either.
A similar category, with a similar result is that of sets are injective
partial functions.  Interestingly, if you want to know on what category
it is natural to define l^2 as a functor, it is sets and partial injections.

Peter,

Do you have any interesting examples of ``domain equations'' over this
category?
There is certainly no model of the lambda calculus there.

In answer to the obvious query: yes, I did indeed check the standard
sources before I let that word pass. And I decided the standard
sources need to be improved.

Now I must agree we've lived all these years without feeling the need
for yet another adverb that starts out with "there-". The O.E.D. lists
38 of them:

  thereabout, thereabove, thereafter, thereafterward, thereagain,
  thereagainst, thereamong, thereat, thereaway, therebefore,
  therebeside, thereby, theredown, thereforth, therefrom, therehence,
  therein, thereinto, there-nigh, thereof, thereon, thereout,
  thereover, therethrough, theretill, thereto, theretofore,
  theretoward, thereunder, thereuntill, thereunto, thereup, thereupon,
  thereward, therewhile, therewith, therewithal, therewithin

But none of these works as a replacement for "therebetween" in either
of the following two lines from my recent missive:

  the category whose objects are all Hilbert spaces that can be
  isometrically embedded in  A  and whose maps are all linear 
  operators therebetween of bound at most  1.

  the subcategory of all closed subspaces of  A  and all inclusion 
  maps therebetween.

So why not shoot for 39?

Best thoughts,
  Peter

As my last paragraph tried to make clear, we can't expect much.  If we
define Hom(X,Y) as (adj X) tensor Y then the functor

     A directsum Hom(x,Y)

 looks as if it ought to have an interesting fixed point.  It doesn't.

Subject: Re: is union associative?

Ilya Beylin asked for which categories is union associative, where
union is defined by:
                        Consider the following diagram

                           A
                           |a
                           V    b
                           W <----- B

and define union of two morphisms a U b := Pushout(Pullback(X))

(I'm a little troubled with a non-idempotent operation being called a
union.)

It's true in any pre-topos. For a proof I would specialize to the case
that  W  is the terminator (move to the slice category if it isn't).
Let me use  @  for the binary operation on isomorphism types
characterized by the pushout diagram

             A x B
            /     \
           A       B               (add downward arrows)
            \     /
             A @ B

(where it's understood that the top half is a product diagram}. Given 
a subobject  X' in  X  recall that  X/X'  is characterized by the 
pushout

               X'
             /   \
            X     Spt(X')
             \   /
              X/X'

where  Spt(X'), the support of  X', is the image of  X; -> 1.  Then

  A @ B   =    (A + B)/(AxSpt(B) + Spt(A)xB)).

Beyond the pre-topos case, I have no idea of just what's needed. For a
counterexampe take the category of  Z-sets (an object is a set with an
automorphism) in which all orbits have three or fewer elements, take
A  to be a two-element orbit, B  to be a three-element orbit. Then
A @ (B @ B)  is the terminator and  (A @ B) @ B  is isomoprhic to
A + 1.  (B @ B  is the terminator and in any category  1 @ X  =  1.
A @ B  is  A + B.)

"Compact objects and perfect morphisms"
by M.M. Clementino, E. Giuli and W. Tholen

Abstract:
In a category with a subobject structure and a closure operator,
we provide a categorical theory of compactness and perfectness
which yields a number of classical results of general topology
as special cases, including the product theorems by Tychonoff
and Frolik and the existence of Stone-Cech compactifications,
both for spaces and maps. Applications to other categories are
also provided.

We wish to announce the availability (by ftp or WWW) of the following paper
(revised version)

                     Natural deduction and coherence 
                    for weakly distributive categories

                                 by

         R.F. Blute, J.R.B. Cockett, R.A.G. Seely, and T.H. Trimble


ABSTRACT:
This paper examines coherence for certain monoidal categories using
techniques coming from the proof theory of linear logic, in particular
making heavy use of the graphical techniques of proof nets.  We define a two
sided notion of proof net, suitable for categories like weakly distributive
categories which have the two-tensor structure (times/par) of linear logic,
but lack a negation operator.  Representing morphisms in weakly distributive
categories as such nets, we derive a coherence theorem for such categories.
As part of this process, we develop a theory of expansion-reduction systems
with equalities and a term calculus for proof nets, each of which is of
independent interest.  In the symmetric case the expansion reduction system
on the term calculus yields a decision procedure for the equality of maps
for free weakly distributive categories.

The main results of this paper are these.  First we have proved coherence
for the full theory of weakly distributive categories, extending similar
results for monoidal categories to include the treatment of the tensor
units.  Second, we extend these coherence results to the full theory of
*-autonomous categories - providing a decision procedure for the maps of
free symmetric *-autonomous categories.  Third, we derive a conservative
extension result for the passage from weakly distributive categories to
*-autonomous categories.  We show strong categorical conservativity, in the
sense that the unit of the adjunction between weakly distributive and
*-autonomous categories is fully faithful.


NOTES:
This is a significant revision of an earlier version announced a year ago.
The paper has been completely rewritten, and has been enhanced in several
ways:  
1) We now treat the cases with non-logical axioms, and with non-commutative
tensor and par, in considerable detail, pointing out in passing where the
traditional treatment (of the pure commutative case) does not work in these
cases.  For example, the traditional proof of sequentiality (via splitting
links) does not work in the presence of non-logical axioms.  
2) We develop a term calculus for proof nets, and a theory of expansion -
reduction rewrite systems, both of which are of independant interest.
3) Using this new material has made the proofs clearer and more complete.

        	The SHAPE project
       		------------------

        Post-doctoral Research Fellowship
        ---------------------------------

The Shape project is developing some exciting new ideas in the
semantics of data types so that they can be incorporated into
programming languages, especially a parallel language suitable for
numerical analysis. The key concept is that data is stored
in shapes (or containers, or structures) which can be described and
manipulated separately from the data. Expected benefits are: 

      - that programs will be able to act on inputs of arbitrary shape
        (shape polymorphism); 
      - that shape errors (e.g. array bound errors) can be detected
        during compilation (shape analysis), and;
      - that (most) run-time operations will act on arrays.

Further information about the theory of shape can be obtained by
anonymous ftp from ftp.socs.uts.edu.au in the directory users/cbj in
the file shapelyTypes.ps.Z and the sub-directory P2.

A prototype functional language is currently under development. When
stable, it must be implemented so that it can run on the CM5. In
addition to capturing the benefits listed above, shape information may
help in optimisation.

The UTS team currently has two staff and three graduate students, with
additional collaborators in Australia, Canada and Europe. Now, with
funding from a large ARC grant, we are looking for a post-doctoral
research fellow. The position is for up to three years at a salary
range of $42,198 - $43,781.

A doctorate in computer science (or its equivalent) is essential.  The
candidate must be able to make a significant contribution to the
project. The ideal candidate will have experience in implementing
languages on parallel computers, optimisation of programs for parallel
computers, functional programming, or; type theory. The candidate must
have initiative, be able to work well as part of a team, and
communicate effectively.
