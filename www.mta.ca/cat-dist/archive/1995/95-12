\title{On the equivariant 2-type of a $G$-space}

\begin{abstract} 

A classical theorem of Mac Lane and Whitehead states that
the homotopy type of a topological space with trivial homotopy at
dimensions 3 and greater can be re\-con\-struct\-ed from its $\pi_1$ and
$\pi_2$, and a cohomology class $k_3\in H^3(\pi_1,\pi_2)$. More recently,
Moerdijk and Svensson suggested the possibility of using Bredon cohomology
to extend this result to the equivariant case, that is, for spaces $X$
equipped with an action by a fixed group $G$. In this paper we carry out
this suggestion and prove an analogue of the classical result in the
equivariant case.

         Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Sydney

As a result of a three-year Australian Research Grant awarded to Max Kelly 
for research into "two-dimensional universal algebra" - by which is meant
the study of structures borne, not just by sets, but by categories and the
like - there are funds available to support a position of Postdoctoral
Fellow at the University of Sydney for three years from the beginning of 
1996. A copy of the formal advertisement sent to the Australian newspapers
appears below. (The salaries quoted are under review, and may before long 
be increased by 2% if all goes well - but this is still uncertain.) Among 
the good recent sources for getting some flavour of the subject as practised
at Sydney are:   

R.Blackwell, G.M.Kelly, and A.J.Power, Two-dimensional monad theory,
J. Pure Appl. Algebra} 59 (1989), 1-41;     

G.M.Kelly, S.Lack, and R.F.C.Walters, Coinverters and categories of fractions 
for categories with structure,  Applied Categorical Structures 1(1993), 95-102.

Note that appointments are made these days by committees that are bound by
very precise rules. No-one may be appointed who does not demonstrably possess
each of the essential qualifications - so applicants would be well-advised to
address these qualifications one-by-one and argue that they possess them.

Here is the formal advertisement that will appear in Australia next week:

Post-doctoral Fellow (Fixed-term)    School of Mathematics and Statistics   

                       UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY

The appointee is to assist in all aspects of an ARC-funded research project 
on two-dimensional universal algebra - that is, the study of structures borne 
by categories and the like.

A Ph.D. in mathematics, either awarded or shortly to be awarded, is an essential 
qualification - as are a general familiarity with modern category theory, 
including 2-categories and other enriched categories, together with some 
experience of research into categories with structure or higher-dimensional 
categories, and evidence of an outstanding capacity for the understanding of 
mathematics at the highest level.  Any familiarity with higher-dimensional 
categories, including bicategories and tricategories, would be an advantage.

Appointment is for three years.

		      LOGIC-RELATED CONFERENCES

	  http://www.research.att.com/lics/logic-confs.html

  Over the last few years there has been a proliferation of
conferences that overlap in their technical scope with the Symposium
on Logic in Computer Science (LICS).  These conferences are scheduled
with no prior coordination among them, which results quite often in
conflicts.  For example, in 1995 LICS and FPCA were at exactly the
same time and the same place with no prior coordination.

  In an attempt to address this situation, the LICS organization will
maintain a WWW page of conferences (including workshops) that have an
overlap with logic in computer science.  The first half of the page is
a list of conferences and associated contacts.  The second half is an
incomplete list of dates, some tentative and some fixed, for upcoming
meetings of these conferences.

  If you are an organizer of one of these conferences and have some
information you would like included in the page, please send mail to
lics-request@research.att.com.

Subject: Dinatural exercise 

Date: Wed, 6 Dec 1995 09:08:19 -0500
From: Peter Freyd <pjf@saul.cis.upenn.edu>

Is this new?

  Let  *A*  be a locally small category. Let  *D*  be the category
  whose objects are set-valued bifunctors on  *A*  (contravariant on
  the first variable, covariant on the second) and whose maps are the
  dinatural transformations. Then  *A*  is a groupoid.

Well, OK, what I mean is that dinaturals are closed under composition iff
*A*  is a groupoid. (And, yes, this could all be done with the category of
sets replaced with a topos.)

I trust the following is old, but who has a reference?

  If  *A*  is a groupoid then  *D*  is equivalent to the category of
  presheaves on  *A*.

	From: Peter Freyd
	[Let  *D*  be the category
	whose objects are] set-valued bifunctors on  *A*  (contravariant on
	the first variable, covariant on the second)

Two definitional/notational suggestions:

	1.   "sesquifunctors on A" for the objects of *D*
	
	2.   A -X A as a notation for *D*

The right-hand half of the X in -X is intended to suggest the
contravariant bit.  One then has the following hierarchy.

  A => B   "functions" from A to B, viz. !A -o B
  A -o B   (homo)morphisms from A to B
  A -X B   sesquifunctors A\op x A -> B, dinaturally transformed

The first two come from linear logic, with !A = FU being interpreted as
the underlying object (e.g. underlying set) of A reflected back into
the category via F.  F serves merely to make the underlying objects the
same "kind" as the objects they underlie, avoiding a proliferation of
kinds in order to keep linear logic typeless, or at least kindless.

Subject: associativity and commutativity of addition 

Date: Thu, 7 Dec 1995 12:06:31 +0100
From: BOERGER <Reinhard.Boerger@FernUni-Hagen.de>

It is well-known that a category in which finite products exist and 
coincide with finite coproducts (i.e. a zero object exists and the 
binary product functor is naturally equivalent to the binary 
coproduct functor) is semi- additive, i.e. enriched over the monoidal 
closed category of commutative monoids. Conversely, in a semi-
additive category, every (existing) finite product is automatically a 
finite coroduct in the canonical way (an vice versa). Now my student 
Claus Kirschner observed that the proof of the latter fact does not 
use associativity and commutativity of the addition. Strange enough, 
together with the first fact this means: If a category with finite 
products has an operation called "addition" with neutral element 0 on 
each hom-set satisfying f0=0f=0 and the distributive laws, then the 
addition is automatically associative and commutative. Has anyone 
ever seen this before?
   Of course, finite products (or coproducts) are essential; 
otherwise one can easily construct single-object counterexamples. On 
the other hand, Hilbert observes something similar but different in 
an appendix to his book "Grundlagen der Geometrie": For unital rings, 
the commutativity of addition follows from the other axioms; one can 
even relax the exisence of the additive inverse to cancellation 
conditions. The argument is as follows: 
x+x+y+y=(1+1)x+(1+1)y=(1+1)(x+y)=1(x+y)+1(x+y)=x+y+x+y
Cancelling x on the left and y on the right, we get x+y=y+x.
Does anybody know more about  similar implications?

This interesting remark illustrates a general algebraic phenomenon that
occurs when dealing with "unitary" theories or sketches. The most
well-known example is about internal groups in the category Gr of groups :
they are automatically
commutative (in the appropriate sense). Another example : internal "non
necessarily associative categories" in Gr are automatically associative.

On the other hand, an internal semigroup in the category Semigr of
semigroups need not be commutative; this is the reason why Semigr has many
multiplicative closed structures while Gr (or Mon, the category of monoids)
has none.

Unitary and non-unitary algebraic theories definitely have a very different
behaviour; this is one of the reasons why I think that the theory of
taxonomies (i.e. "categories without identities") should be taken more
seriously!

I guess someone has to say it for the record. The question:

  If a category with finite products has an operation called
  "addition" with neutral element 0 on each hom-set satisfying f0=0f=0
  and the distributive laws, then the addition is automatically
  associative and commutative. Has anyone ever seen this before?

Yes, starting at least with Eckmann/Hilton in the 50's.

Subject: Dinatural exercise solved 

Date: Sun, 10 Dec 1995 15:36:34 -0500
From: Peter Freyd <pjf@saul.cis.upenn.edu>

I had asked if the following is new:

  Let  *A*  be a locally small category. Let  *D*  be the category
  whose objects are set-valued bifunctors on  *A*  (contravariant on
  the first variable, covariant on the second) and whose maps are the
  dinatural transformations. Then  *A*  is a groupoid.

Meaning, of course, that dinaturals are closed under composition iff
*A*  is a groupoid.

Well, all I've received are requests for the proof. So: given  *A* 
let  P  denote the covariant power-set functor on the category of
sets. Fix an object  C.  Consider the bifunctor that sends  A  to
P(C,A)  and consider the dinatural transformation  (A,A) -> P(C,A)
that sends an endomorphism  e  in  (A,A)  to the set of solutions o
the equation:
                x          x    e
              C -> A  =  C -> A -> A.

The composition  1 -> (A,A) -> P(C,A)  has as its unique value the
_entire_ subset of maps from  C  to  A. If it is dinatural then for
any  f:A -> C: 
                  P(C,A) 
                /
              1      | P(1,f)
                \
                  P(C,C).
                                                 g    f
Every endomorphism of  C  is thus of the form  C -> A -> C. In
particular, the identity map is of that form, that is, f  is left
invertible, hence, every map targeted at  C  is left-invertible. If
this remains true for every  C  then every map in  *A*  is left
invertible, thus invertible.

I also asked for a reference for:

 If  *A*  is a groupoid then  *D*  is equivalent to the category of
  presheaves on  *A*.

Nobody's asked for it, but let  *A*  be a groupoid anyway. For any
target category and any dinatural  S -> T  one may easily prove that
the hexagon used for defining dinaturals expands to a commutative
diagram (from which the computability of dinaturals easily follows):

                  SAA  ------------------> TAA

            SfA /     \ SAf           TfA /    \ TAf

          SBA             SAB  -->  TBA            TAB

            SBf \     / SfB           TBf \    / TfB
 
                  SBB  -------------------> TBB.

  If  *A*  is a groupoid then the category composed of dinaturals
  between bifunctors from  *A*  to  *B*  is equivalent to the category
  composed of natural transformations between covariant functors from 
  *A*  to  *B*.

Show that for any bifunctor, S, there is an isomorphism (in the
category composed of dinaturals) to a bifunctor, T, with the special
property that  TAB = TAA  and  TAx = TA1. Given  S  define  T  to be
the bifunctor such that  TAB = SAA  and  Tfg = Sff' (where  f'  is the
inverse of  f). The collection of identity functions from  SAA  to
TAA  forms a dinatural transformation as does the collection of
identity functions from  TAA  back to  SAA.

The full subcategory of such functors is easily seen to be isomorphic
to the category of contravariant functors from  *A*  to  *B*.

From: Sebastiano Vigna <vigna@colos3.usr.dsi.unimi.it>

Suppose you have coloured graphs G,H (with multiple edges,
etc. i.e., we are in the topos of coloured graphs). A morphism
G->H induces a functor between the free categories generated
by G and H. I am interested in those morphisms which induce
discrete opfibrations. Has anyone studied this notion?
Essentially, any arc f(x)->y of H can be lifted uniquely
to an arc (with the same label) x->x', for some x' such
that f(x')=y.

From: Peter Freyd <pjf@saul.cis.upenn.edu>

Whoops. I lifted the proof I posted yesterday out of a longer ms I'm
writing. It occured to me (you know how it goes -- around 3 a.m.) that
it assumed the reader already knew the dinatural transformation
1 -> (A,A). Its source is the terminal set-valued bifunctor: the
constant bifunctor whose constant value is a one-element set. Its
target is the "hom" bifunctor. The dinatural transformation is the one
with identity maps as values.

See: the reader did already know it (because, of course, it's the
only dinatural from  1  to  (A,A)  that can be defined uniformly for
all categories).

WoLLIC'96 is part of a larger biennial event in computer science being held in
the campus of the Federal University of Bahia from the 6th to the 10th of May
1996: the `6th SEMINFO' (6th Informatics Week).  The 6th SEMINFO will involve
parallel sessions, tutorials, mini-courses, as well as the XI Brazilian
Conference on Mathematical Logic (EBL'96), and a Workshop on Distributed
Systems (WoSiD'96).

Submission:
Two-page abstracts, preferably by e-mail to *** wollic96@di.ufpe.br *** must be
RECEIVED by MARCH 8th, 1996 by the Chair of the Organising Committee. Authors
will be notified of acceptance by April 8th, 1996.  The 3rd WoLLIC'96 is under
the official auspices of the Interest Group in Pure and Applied Logics (IGPL)
and The European Association for Logic, Language and Information (FoLLI).
Abstracts will be published in the Journal of the IGPL (ISSN 0945-9103) as part
of the meeting report.  Selected contributed papers will be invited for
submission (in full version) to a special issue of the Journal.

The location:
Salvador, Capital of the Bahia state, the first European settlement of
Portuguese America and the first Capital of Brazil, is where all the most
important colonial buildings were constructed: churches, convents, palaces,
forts and many other monuments.  Part of the city historical center has been
safekept by UNESCO since 1985. Five hundred years of blending Native American,
Portuguese, and African influences have left a rich culture to its people, which
can be felt on its music, food, and mysticism.  Salvador is located on the
northeastern coast of Brazil and the sun shines year round with the average
temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.  It is surrounded by palm trees and beaches
with warm water.  City population is around 2.5 million and life style is quite
relaxed.

Subject: (Fwd) Re: Abstracts "Descent Theory", Oberwolfach '95

Dear Colleagues,

a link has been appended to my  WWW home page to obtain the notes of Ross
Street's lectures on Descent Theory at the Oberwolfach Conference in September.
These files may accessed also directly; the address is


        ftp://ftp.mpce.mq.edu.au/pub/maths/Categories/Oberwolfach/

The files themselves are:

-rw-r--r--  1 ross     ftpmaths  1329104 Dec 13 16:34 Oberwolfach_1.ps
-rw-r--r--  1 ross     ftpmaths   707855 Dec 13 16:33 Oberwolfach_1.ps.Z

... giving a PostScript file (txt)  and a compressed (binary) version
of each.

A good Web browser can get them using the above as a  URL.
It may even automatically uncompress and render the PostScript file.

Best wishes for the Holiday Season and a Happy New Year!

Walter.

Subject: Query about citations 

Date: Fri, 22 Dec 1995 16:49:27 -0800
From: David B. Benson <dbenson@eecs.wsu.edu>

One defines the category of Diagrams on category A, Diag(A), as
in Makkai & Pare's "Accessible Categories".  One similarly defines
the category of cones on diagrams on A and the category of
cocones on diagrams on A.  Limits and colimits exist when
certain adjunctions hold between these derived categories.

I am sure I have seen one or more papers or monographs giving
the details for the above.  I simply cannot recall where this (these)
workout(s) appeared.  I would like to (re)read the paper(s), so
I would greatly appreciate receiving reminders about where
to look for these results.

Thank you in advance.

With the warmest of season's greetings,
David

In answer to David Benson's question of 22 Dec, a BETTER way of looking
at the whole matter, which works even for weighted limits, is explained
in 
	Albert, H.M. and Kelly, G.M., The closure of a class of colimits,
	JPAA 51 (1988) 1--17
