Has there been any work on "categories" with composition as a relation
instead of a function?

We would allow several "composites" of two arrows but would likely
require unique composition with the identity:

	f o id = {f}

I am replying to Peter's letter about Kluwer.  I had actually
intended to reply to him, but of course replies go to the list.
First off, let me say that the simplest solution to the point he
raised is to discard the form and write your own report.  Beggars
can't be choosers and they are begging you.  A similar problem with
the referee forms used by NSERC, the Canadian granting agency.  The
forms are pretty useless for mathematics.  Many referees follow them
anyway and you have to wade through the irrelevancy to get to the
meat, if any, of the report.  Others ignore the form and simply
write a report and those are the most useful.

However, I will not referee a report for ACS under any circumstances
and I guess those forms are indirectly responsible.  I submitted a
paper to them on fuzzy models of linear logic.  Briefly, it showed
that there was a *-autonomous category whose objects were sets and
arrows were fuzzy relations.  Now, I won't go into the other flaws
in the paper as originally submitted, which might well have justified
rejection, but the actual reason given for rejecting it was that it
was not within the scope of the journal.  Since it was squarely an
application of category theory, I have concluded that I have no idea
what the scope of the journal is and have therefore refused to
referee papers for them.

I believe that the real reason for the journal's problems are that
the publisher deals with the refereeing process instead of having
editors for that purpose.  It is probably unimportant, since I don't
really expect most print journals to be around in ten years.

Dear All,

re categories with relational composition:



David Espinosa <espinosa@cs.columbia.edu> asked: 
"Has there been any work on "categories" with composition as a relation
instead of a function?

We would allow several "composites" of two arrows but would likely
require unique composition with the identity:

        f o id = {f}

Such objects naturally occur in some studies of homotopy coherence in 
abstract homotopy theory.  There is a set of possible composites so 
a choice of composite is made to make life easy, but in 
this context, any two choices are related by higher dimensional data. Of 
course associativity does not work but does up to higher diemnsional 
data.  This is linked to some ideas in bicategories.  Perhaps the fact 
that the resulting THING is constructed rather like a Kleisli category 
but with a choice of "multiplication" on the "monad" is significant.

If anyone is interested I can expand further on this.

   Do you have any examples in mind?  Abstractions with no examples have
   an unfortunate track record.

Jim,

Thanks for your suggestions, and sorry to omit the examples.

I'm considering a "category" whose objects are type constructors,
given as endofunctions on a base category, and whose arrows are
_situated monads_ relating the type constructors.

There's no _function_ for monad composition, but perhaps we can obtain
a _relation_ by describing conditions for a monad to be a composition
of two others.  Does that sound reasonable (or like anything else
you've seen)?

After working out the details, I find that under a relational
definition of monad composition,

	M = M o id
but
	M not= id o M

In other words, there exists a situated monad N (not equal to M) such
that

	N = id o M
	
For "composition as a relation" to be useful, I would guess that both
identities would have to come out exactly (as well as associativity).
After all, it's not much fun to compose the identity and get something
else back!  But, in general, I like the idea of relational composition
and would be interested to see some applications.  Thanks again for
your help.

The full development follows, in case you're interested.

David


Situated Monads
---------------

A _situated monad_ PQ is a triple

	PQ     : im(P)          -> im(Q)
	unitPQ : P(A)           -> Q(A)
	bindPQ : (P(A) -> Q(B)) -> (Q(A) -> Q(B))

obeying the usual monad laws and also

	PQ(P(A)) = Q(A).

PQ is the object part of a functor between full subcategories im(P)
and im(Q) whose arrow part is

	mapPQ : (P(A) -> P(B)) -> (Q(A) -> Q(B))
	mapPQ(f) = bindPQ(unitPQ o f)

UnitPQ is a natural transformation from

	i_P      : im(P) -> C   to
	i_Q o PQ : im(P) -> C

where i_P and i_Q are the inclusion functors of im(P) and im(Q) into
the base category C.  BindPQ (as usual) seems to have a categorical
description solely as a map between hom-sets.  Join (monadic eta)
seems inappropriate because PQ is not an endofunctor, and thus join is
ill-typed.


Monad composition as a relation
-------------------------------

If we want to say that (as situated monads)

	PR = PQ o QR

we can postulate

	unitPR             = unitPQ o unitQR
	bindPR(unitQR o f) = mapQR(bindPQ(f))

for f : P(A) -> Q(B).  The latter obtains by pushing f both ways through
the composition triangle.  These imply

	mapPR = mapPQ o mapQR

So far, so good.  Now let's see what happens if PQ = id or QR = id.
Does it follow that "composition" with the identity is the identity?
With QR = id, we find

	unitPR = unitPQ
	bindPR = bindPQ

but with PQ = id, we have

	unitPR = unitQR
	mapPR  = mapQR

which is much weaker.  We could add another law

	bindQR(f) = bindPR(f o unitPQ)

for f : Q(A) -> R(B), but this implies for QR = id that

	f = bindPQ(f o unitPQ)

which is false for monads (take PQ as the list monad and f as
reverse).

So left composition with the identity doesn't yield exactly the same
monad back (under the above definition of composition).  We have

	PQ = PQ o id
but
	QR not= id o QR
	
This asymmetry doesn't surprise me, since Kleisli composition isn't
symmetric (the arrows to be composed don't have symmetric types if we
look at its most general typing).  Unfortunately, I would expect that
both identities (and associativity as well) would need to hold for
composition to make sense, even as a relation.

To me this gives your question an entirely different flavor.  You
might want to post your question again with the above target example
added.

There is a lot of work on combinig triples, e.g. Manes.  My impression
is that it is not obvious what it means to combine 2 triples.  (One
way is the stacking below.)

There is some mention of combining triples with distribute laws in

	Barr, Wells, toposes, triples, and theories, '85, Springer

Bicategories may be relevant.

	MacLane, Pare, coherence for bicategories and indexed
	categories, JPAA (Journ. of Pure and Applied Alg.) '85

There is a paper by Palmquist, in I think Springer LNM 195, on the
double category of adjoint pairs.  Double categories are categories
internal to the category of small categories.  2-categories are a
special case of both bicategories and of double categories.  Monoidal
categories are a special case of bicategories.  

	Borceux, handbook of categorical algebra, '94, Cambridge
	
may be helpful on some of this.

Finitary triples are those commuting with filtered colimits.  One can
stack them by starting with set to a discrete power, taking a finitary
triple on that, forming the category of algebras, taking a finitary
triple on that, forming the category of algebras, ...  The net result
of a finite such stack can also be obtained with just 2 special
layers.  The 1st has as algebras the sketches in the sense of my
`tensor and linear time' and the 2nd follows from the reflector
following from the orthogonality.

   The full development follows, in case you're interested.

Maybe I'll read it sometime.  The sad truth is that it's hard to write
and even harder to get anyone to read it.  (However I have found one
reader for my writing.  Myself.  It's amazing what one forgets.)

I have no opinion on the notational question.  I suppose the standard
notation is backward, but I am not going to change now.  I use d^0 and d^1,
BTW, reserving the lower index for the dimension, which in this case is 1.

If an equational category has a Mal'cev operator (a ternary operation
t with t(x,x,y) = t(y,x,x) = y), then every simplicial object is Kan.
This is essentially clear from John Moore's proof of the group case,
in which forms xy^{-1}z appear repeatedly.  For an equational category,
the converse is also true, since a special case of every simplicial
object being Kan is that every reflexive relation is an equivalence
relation, a well-known characterization of Mal'cev.

Most familiar Mal'cev categories have a group structure, so the Kan
condition follows from the case for groups.  Just about the only
familiar Mal'cev category that I can think of that lacks a group op
is Heyting algebras and I don't know any application of simplicial
Heyting algebras.

This is a response to Mike Barr's message of 28 February. I agree with
him that the Kluwer form used by `Applied Categorical Structures' is no
worse than that used by grant-giving bodies such as NSERC---the British
EPSRC forms are every bit as bad as those used by NSERC, believe me---
but there is an important difference: we don't have any `muscle' in
arguments with the grant-giving bodies because we are all, to a greater
or lesser extent, beholden to them ourselves, whereas (thanks largely
to the Internet) referees do now have collective muscle which we can
deploy against journal editors and publishers (as Mike rightly points
out, they are dinosaurs under imminent threat of extinction in any
case), and in my view we should use it if by so doing we can improve
the conditions under which we operate.

Incidentally, to correct a misunderstanding of my original message
which some people seem to have made: I wasn't simply saying that in
future I will ignore the APCS questionnaire (I have been doing that
since the journal started, in any case), but rather that I will ignore
any papers which are sent to me accompanied by the questionnaire---I
will only referee papers which are sent without the questionnaire. If
we all agree to do that, then Kluwer will very quickly be forced to
abandon the wretched thing.

The case against the form is fairly clear (although, so far, I thought
it was easier to complete than to discuss). The only question is which
muscle should we use:

* leftist: 	flood Mrs. Sonneveld with angry messages, signed
		something like )8-\

* rightist: 	dispatch a joint letter, signed something like
		Internetional Academy of Applied Categorical

I doubt that this network will provide for a real flood. For an
effect, we'll probably have to act rightist...

I mean, seriously, if we all agree, a joint statement will probably do
it. Otherwise, I can contribute a message to Mrs. Sonneveld, but it
will probably be one of five or so.

Date: Thu, 09 Mar 1995 12:09:04 +0000
From: Prof R. Brown <mas010@bangor.ac.uk>

The nerve of a groupoid (not just a group) is also a Kan complex in the strong sense of a simplicial T-complex (Keith Dakin's definition, 1975). A simplicial T-complex (K,T) has sets T_n in K_n of elements called thin with the property that:

1) any horn has a unique thin filler
2) degenerate implies thin
3) if all faces but one of a thin element are thin, so is the last face.

This is of rank less than or equal to n if all simplices in dimensions greater than n are thin. Simplicial T-complexes of rank 1 are equivalent to groupoids (Dakin). 

Simplicial T-complexes in general are equivalent to crossed complexes (Ashley, see Diss Math 265 (1988) Simplicial T-complexes and crossed complexes; Nan Tie, JPAA 56 (1989) 195-209), to infinity-groupoids, and to other things. The notion of cubical T-com
plex is crucial in the proof by Brown-Higgins of an n-dimensional Van Kampen Theorem (JPAA 22 (1981) 11-41), because of the technical point that it easily enables the handling of multiple compositions of homotopy addition lemmas (the boundary of a simplex
 or cube is the "sum" of its faces) without writing down formulae. For polyhedral versions, see D W Jones, Diss Math 266 (1988) A general theory of polyhedral sets and the corresponding T-complexes.)

Part of the point is that the singular complex SX of a space X is a 
Kan complex but the fillers come from the models, so ought, morally,
 to be canonical and to satisfy relations. But these relations are up to 
homotopy, it seems. So it is difficult to be more precise. 

The T-complex condition is very strong, but is nice in that it is easy
 to see how to weaken it. These weakenings need lots more 
investigation. A further point is that a filler of a horn of a triangle 
determines a product, as if it were a `computation'. 

Analogous notions for categories are studied by Ross Street  and by
 Dominic Verity.

Re 1:No,You are absolutely correct if one wishes to use the usual 
simplicial conventions of "face opposite" in describing the simplices of t
the simplicial object associated with the category : its "Nerve".which 
provides a most convenient numbering of the projections and compositions
which occur there.However, it seems almost impossible to get people to 
give up what seems to them an illogical convention for arrows which must
go from 0 to 1!

Re 2: Barr characterised these categories as those which satisfy Malcev's

it.I have one of my own since it really is not too difficult. The observation

Does anyone know of any work on "reversing the Grothendieck ring construction"
in the sense of constructing (and classifying) k-linear monoidal categories
with a given Grothendieck ring?

The only results I know in this direction are results of Kazhdan and
Kerler which show that any C-linear tortile category with the same 
Grothendieck ring as Rep(U(sl_2)) must be C-linear monoidally equivalent to
Rep(U_q(sl_2)) for some q, and a result (probably old, though I know
no source other than my own derivation) that shows that semisimple
C-linear monoidal categories with Grothendieck ring Z[G] for a finite
group G are in 1-1 correspondence with pairs (\alpha, \phi) where
\alpha is a U(1)-valued 3-cocycle, and \phi is a complex number (the

identity transformations).

(This latter shows that "twisted" Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a TQFT 
of Turaev-Viro type.)

Surely there is a citation in the literature for "my" result cited above,
but where?  

Are there any other results along these lines?

Subject: Reference about bimodules seen as generalized machines 

Date: Wed, 15 Mar 1995 17:21:11 +0100 (MET)
From: Sebastiano Vigna <vigna@colos3.usr.dsi.unimi.it>

The title says it all: I'm searching for references of papers which study
bimodules as generalized machines with product, composition and feedback. I
know of a series of papers by Bainbridge in the seventies, and I've been
(vaguely) told about the existence of something written by Bill Lawvere
about this. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!

EPSRC Earmarked Research Studentship
Mathematics Programme
Identities among relations for monoids and categories
Start: October, 1995

I would be grateful if this studentship could be drawn to the 
attention of any appropriate person. The full funding would be 
given to students with UK residential qualifications; EC citizens do 
qualify, and get fees, but no grant, so it seems unlikely to be
 appropriate more generally. 

The work will apply 2-categories and 2-groupoids in areas 
as in the title, and in areas related to aspects of computer 
science. It is expected to involve symbolic computation with 
AXIOM, GAP, MAGMA. 

The School of Mathematics has a networked Research Laboratory 
with a DEC Alpha 2100 server, model 4/200, supported by EPSRC and 
University grants.

                    LINEAR LAUCHLI SEMANTICS

               R. F. Blute             P. J. Scott


We introduce a linear analogue of Lauchli's semantics for
intuitionistic logic. In fact, our result is a strengthening
of Lauchli's work to the level of proofs, rather than
provability. This is obtained by considering continuous actions
of the additive group of integers on a category of topological
vector spaces. The semantics, based on functorial
polymorphism, consists of dinatural transformations which are
equivariant with respect to all such actions. Such dinatural
transformations are called uniform. To any sequent in
Multiplicative Linear Logic (MLL), we associate a vector space
of ``diadditive'' uniform transformations. We then show that this
space is generated by denotations of cut-free proofs of
the sequent in the theory MLL+MIX. Thus we obtain a full
completeness theorem in the sense of Abramsky and Jagadeesan,
although our result differs from theirs in the use of
dinatural transformations.

As corollaries, we show that these dinatural transformations compose,
and obtain a conservativity result: diadditive dinatural transformations
which are uniform with respect to actions of the additive group of
integers are also uniform with respect to the actions of arbitrary
cocommutative Hopf algebras. Finally, we discuss several possible
extensions of this work to noncommutative logic.

It is well known that the intuitionistic version of
Lauchli's semantics is a special case of the theory of logical
relations, due to Plotkin and Statman.
Thus, our work can also be viewed as a first step towards
developing a theory of logical relations for linear
logic and concurrency.

Fellow category theorists

This one is not really about category theory, although I have seen discussions on closely related matters on this very list some time ago.  I have just applied for a bunch of jobs in France and one particular tentacle of the French administrative hydra ha
s asked me for a translation of my McGill PhD vellum.  Thus it goes

It is rather obvious what the general meaning is, but I need a close, professional looking translation.  I know there are some good Latinists out there!  It is only now that I regret not having paid any attention during the four years of Latin I had to su
ffer through, more than 25 years ago "What? Me, learn a dead language?".

Dear colleagues

Consider a simplicial group K. Its realization |K| is a topological
group (at least when K is countable).
The realization of the W-construction yields a universal
|K|-bundle over |overline W K|. 
THere should be a canonical map from the latter to the bar
construction B|K| on |K|. 

Has this been worked out somewhere in the literature?

Many thanks in advance.

Sincerely yours Johannes
