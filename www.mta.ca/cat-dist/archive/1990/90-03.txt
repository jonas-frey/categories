Dear Bob:

Aurelio's contention is quite correct.  In fact, the error was corrected
in the final version that has been accepted for the new journal.  In
fact, the only limits that are needed are products (which certainly
exist; they are disjoint unions) and the equalizer of a group of
automorphisms (which can be shown to exist).  The latter is needed to do
the dual of the symmetric algebra construction; the group is the
symmetric group acting on tensor powers.

Dear Bob:
In the future it might be useful if you could ask for a reaction to such a
message so the correction could be sent out at the same time. - Michael

Dear Colleague:

This letter is to announce the availability of a Bulletin Board for Category
Theory on BITNET. The address is CATEGORIES@MTA.BITNET.

The intention is to operate in a manner similar to the Types Bulletin Board.
To join the mailing list, simply send a message to:

categories-request@mta.bitnet.

After confirmation of two-way transmission your name will be added to the list.
Please provide a very complete return address. To distinguish messages for
forwarding from others of an administrative nature, please mail to Categories
ONLY messages which are intended to be forwarded. All other messages should be
sent to  categories-request@mta.bitnet, or to me ( rrosebrugh@mta.bitnet )

Anyone may submit (electronically only) any material about Category Theory (and
only about Category Theory) for distribution - abstracts, announcements of
results or meetings, queries, or full papers. Material will be forwarded as
received unless there is evidence that the message received is garbled. The
initial committment is that turn-around times will not exceed a couple of days.

TeX files are welcome in any flavour - plain, AmSTeX or LaTeX. They should
include a Character Code Reference which is available on request.
Unfortunately, until we see how well this works, there can be no committment to
either authors or subscribers regarding accuracy of TeX files transmitted. TeX
preprints will be archived separately, and a catalogue of them will be
published irregularly. Macro packages are the responsibility of the author,
however an attempt will be made to archive versions of diagram macro packages.

I gratefully acknowledge assistance from David Jones at Types who suggested
some of the procedures to be used. Electronic addresses to which this is being
sent are taken from lists provided by Mike Barr and Max Kelly, and I thank
them (and Mike Johnson who transmitted Max's list.)

Those seem to be the main points. Looking forward to a useful exchange,

Regards,

Bob Rosebrugh

The following message has been sent out to about 100 addresses from
Mike's and Max's address lists. On the assumption that anyone I have heard
from wishes to be included on the subscriber list, I have included you already.
Let's see how it goes.

 There are available, in principle, copies of the ABSTRACTS of the first
four EECS meetings (1986, 1987, 1988, 1989).  I say "in principle" because
I have copies, and can Xerox them for anyone who might want them -- but in
the face of too many requests, I'll probably have to ask for some sum with
which to defray duplication and mailing expenses.

I will be in Oxford during April and May and will not read email sent
to CWRU during that time.  Please remove me from the category theory
mailing list.  If I can get an email address at Oxford I will rejoin.

Subject: What are EECS meetings?

EECS stands for Eastern European Category Seminar.  There have been such
affairs since 1986.  Generally taking place each March, they've been
organised by Prof. V.V. Topencharov of the Center for Applied Math. & C.S.
in Sofia (P.O. Box 384, Sofia 1000 Bulgaria) and his cohorts (students,
assistants, and a small international network of colleagues) since 1986.

The venue for these meetings has been a ski lodge at Predela, perhaps 100 km
south of Sofia, about half way between Blagoevgrad and Razlog on the saddle
road between the Rila mountains (to the north) and the Pirins (to the south).

The first three years, meteorological conditions were perfect for skiers.
The last two, however, a very warm, very early spring annihilated virtually
all snow long before the meeting.

Expressions of interest in attending future EECS meetings (probably mid-March
1991 will be the next one) may be addressed to Topencharov at the address above
or via the Bulgarian Telex number 865 22575 WMI BG (as this is a _central_
telex machine, be sure to mention Topencharov and his address prominently
at the head of your telex message, else it'll not get carried to him) --
or to me using any of the means suggested in the .sig below.
