                Fixed Points in Synthetic Domain Theory

Carl Gunter's comments about the relationship between PERs and traditional
semantics of programming languages has prompted me to make the announcement
I meant to make a fortnight ago.  I strongly differ from the Pennsylvanian
point of view, though, in not considering PERs but an axiomatic approach,
of which there are many different models.

% TeX definitions
\def\E{{\cal E}}\def\imp{\Rightarrow}
\input mssymb % for the next two symbols only:
\def\natno{{\Bbb N}}\def\sigleq{\sqsubseteq}

My axiomatisation is as follows: $\E$ denotes an elementary topos with a
natural numbers object $\natno$; by a "set" I mean an object of $\E$.
If you don't like the word ``topos'', you can understand this as intuitionistic
set theory.  $\Sigma$ is a class of predicates (ie a subobject of $\Omega$)
including true and false and closed under binary conjunction and countable
(ie $\natno$-indexed) existential quantification (disjunction). This is
required to satisfy the following two axioms:
$$      \forall\sigma\in\Sigma.\lnot\lnot\Sigma\imp\Sigma        $$
(Markov's principle) and
$$      \forall\Phi:\Sigma^\natno\to\Sigma.\Phi(\lambda n.\top)\imp
 \exists n\in\natno.\Phi(\lambda m.m\leq n)  $$
(finitary principle). The first will be assumed throughout, the second only
when stated.

Definitions:
(i) the ($\Sigma$-pre-)order $x\sigleq y$ is defined by
 $\forall\phi\in\Sigma^X.\phi(x)\imp\Phi(y)$.
(ii) an object $X$ for which this is antisymmetric is called a
 $\Sigma$-space; this is a ``pointwise Leibnitz principle''.
(iii) A map $p:X\to Y$ which induces an isomorphism $\Sigma^Y\to\Sigma^X$
 is called ($\Sigma$-)equable.
(iv) An object $X$ such that any equable map $p:X\to Y$ with $Y$ a
 $\Sigma$-space is already an isomorphism is called ($\Sigma$-)replete;
 this is an ``objectwise Leibnitz principle''.
(v) An object $X$ with a point $\bot$ such that
 $\forall\phi\in\Sigma^X.\phi(\bot)\imp\forall x\in X.\phi(x)$
 is called focal.
Then a predomain is a replete object and a domain is a focal replete object.

Theorem 1
(i) The full subcategory of predomains is reflective and cartesian closed.
(ii) The full subcategory of domains is cartesian closed.

Theorem 2
The following are equivalent:
(FPP) Every endofunction of a domain has a least fixed point.
(DC) Every predomain is chain-complete and every map between predomains
 preserves suprema of chains.
(LCC) For every chain of adjoint (or embedding-projection) pairs between
 predomains, the limit of the right adjoints (projections) is the
 colimit of the left adjoints (embeddings)
(AX) the finitarity axiom holds.

Powerdomains and dependent-type polymorphism can also be interpreted in this
setting, but not impredicative (Girard-Reynolds second order) polymorphism.

The Effective (Hyland) Topos, in which PERs are embedded, is a model.

There are sheaf (Scott) models based on classical categories of domains. Indeed
any small full subcategory of spaces (not necessarily T-zero) or locales
may be used as a base category, so long as it includes Scott's $P\omega$
and if any space/locale $X$ is in it then so is $X\times P\omega$. There
are even presheaf models, although the disjunctions in the axiomatisation
have to be prefixed with $\lnot\lnot$ and the empty space must not be in
the base category, but the two theorems still hold.

The Recursive (Mulry) Topos is not a model of the axioms as they stand:
the true natural numbers object has to be replaced with a recursive version.

This is "work in progress" which was reported last week at the Categorical
Logic in Computer Science workshop in Paris.

Subject:     TTT-CTCS Corrections
Date:        Thu, 18 Oct 90 11:42:18 EST
From:        "Michael Barr, Math Dept, McGill University"
             <INHB@MUSICB.MCGILL.CA>

Dear Bob:

After your last note, I decided to do the following.  I have changed all
left square brackets to `\lb ' (note the space), all right square
brackets to `\rb ', all carets to `\sp ' and all underlines to `\sb '.
There were no tildes, but I would have changed them to `\spc '.  I
suggest you send it out just as you get it, since there are some people
who don't get it properly.  For the time being, it would appear that you
might solicit all TeX things in that form.  The \sp and \sb are actually
TeX macros.  The other two have to be changed back before TeXxing
because they are used to delimit macro arguments and no subbing is
allowed in that context.

I have also removed the \input ct and replaced it by the definitions
needed, so that this will compile for anyone who has catmac.sty.

Regards, Mike

\begin{center} Corrections to {\it Toposes, Triples and Theories}\\
Michael Barr and Charles Wells\end{center}

The corrections are listed by page number.  The name in parentheses
after the page number shows who told us of the error.  \begin{trivlist}
\item\lb GENERAL COMMENT\rb  Our text is intended primarily as an exposition
of the mathematics, not a historical treatment of it.  In particular, if
we state a theorem without attribution we do not in any way intend to
claim that it is original with this book.  We note specifically that
most of the material in Chapters 4 and 8 is an extensive reformulation
of ideas and theorems due to C. Ehresmann, J. B\'enabou, C. Lair and
their students, to Y. Diers, and to A. Grothendieck and his students.
We learned most of this material second hand or recreated it, and so
generally do not know who did it first.  We will happily correct
mistaken attributions when they come to our attention.

\item\lb p. 9\rb  (Peter Johnstone).  Exercise (SGRPOID) is incorrect as it
stands;
a semilattice without identity satisfies (i) through (iii) but is not a
category.  Condition (iii) must be strengthened to read:
Say an element $e$ has the {\bf identity property} if $e\o f= f$
whenever $e\o f$ is defined and $g\o e= g$ whenever $g\o e$ is
defined.  Then we require that for any
element $f$, there is an element $e$ with the identity property
for which $e\o f$ is defined and an element $e'$ with the identity
property for which $f\o e'$ is defined.

\item\lb p.27\rb  (Dwight Spencer), second line from bottom:  $T:S\to T$
should be $t:S\to T$.

\item\lb pp. 39-40\rb  (Peter Johnstone).  It should be noted that the product
of an empty collection of objects in a category must be a terminal
object.  Then the phrase after the comma on line 4 of p. 40 should read,
``which by an obvious inductive argument is equivalent to requiring that
the category have a terminal object and that any two objects have a
product.''

\item\lb p. 43\rb  (Peter Johnstone).  Exercise (PROD)(b) should read:  ``Show
that if a category has a terminal object and all products of pairs of
objects, then it has all finite products.''

\item\lb p. 49\rb  (Peter Johnstone).  Exercise (FCR) uses the concept of
small category without defining it.  It is used in the main body of the
text on page 66 and later, and ``small sketch''{} occurs on p. 146.  A
graph or a category is {\bf small} if its arrows constitute a set.  A
sketch is small if its graph is small and its cones and cocones
constitute a set.  In connection with the discussion of foundations on
page ix of the Preface, no matter what set theory is used, one is going
to have to deal with categories and graphs whose arrows do not
constitute sets.

\item\lb p. 49\rb   Closing parenthesis missing at end of Exercise (EAPL)(a).

\item\lb p. 53\rb  (Dwight Spencer) The display in the middle of the page
should be:  $i(T,LA)(L(f\o h)) = \eta A\o f\o h = RLf\o \eta D\o h =
RLf\o i(T,LD)(Lh) = i(T,LA)(Lf\o Lh)$

In diagram (7), just below, the vertical arrows should be pointing
upward.

\item\lb p. 54\rb  lines 5 from the bottom:  (Dwight Spencer) change ``arrow
for'' to ``element of the functor''.  Add to the last sentence ``(A
universal element of $\Hom(A,R(-))$ is called a {\bf universal arrow}
for $R$ and $A$.)''

\item\lb p. 55\rb  line 4:  (Dwight Spencer) change $RLA$ to $RWA$.

\item\lb p. 55\rb  line 14:  (Dwight Spencer) Change $Ry$ to $y$.

\item \lb p. 64\rb  (Dwight Spencer) The diagram at the bottom should be
labeled (1).  (I don't think it is actually referred to, but the diagram
numbering in this section begins with (2).)

\item\lb p. 75\rb  Geometric morphisms are discussed in Chapter 6, not
Chapter 5.

\item \lb p. 125\rb  Third line from bottom.  The word ``morphism'' is
repeated.

\item\lb p. 126\rb  (Felipe Gago-Couso).  Proposition 1 has an omitted
hypothesis.
We include here a complete restatement of the proposition and its
proof:

\item\lb \rb The following proposition gives one method of constructing
morphisms of triples.  We are indebted to Felipe Gago-Couso for finding
the gap in the statement and proof in the first edition and for finding
the correct statement.

\noindent{\bf Proposition 1.}  {\em In the notation of the preceding

In this diagram, square 1 commutes because $\mu$ is a natural
transformation, squares 2 and 3 because $T\mu'$ is and squares 4 and 5
because $\sigma$ is.  The commutativity of square 6 is a triple identity
and square 7 is diagram 4(b).  Finally, diagram 4(a) above says that
$\sigma\o\mu T'=\sigma\o T\sigma$ which means that although the two
arrows between $TTT'$ and $TT'$ are not the same, they are when followed
by $\sigma$, which makes the whole diagram commute.

Squares 1 through 5 of diagram (6) are all examples of part (a) of
Exercise (GOD), Section 1.3.  For example, to see how square 1 fits,
is $\eta'\mu$.

\noindent{\bf Corollary 2.}  {\em With $\T$ and $\T'$ as in Proposition 1,
suppose $\sigma:T' T
\to T'$ is such that $\sigma\o T'\eta =\id$, $\sigma\o\sigma T' =
\sigma\o \eta T:T\to T'$ is a morphism of triples.}

\pf This is Proposition 1 stated in $\Cat\op$ (which means: reverse the
functors but not the natural transformations).

\item\lb p. 134\rb  (Colin McLarty).  In the second through fourth paragraphs
of the proof of (a), every occurrence of ``$L$'' should be ``$W$''.

\item\lb p. 137\rb  (Jim Otto).  Theorem 5 has too few hypotheses and
Proposition 4 too many to apply the latter in the proof of the former.
There are various possibilities of getting it right, including adding
the finite limits and colimits to the hypotheses of Theorem 5.
Nevertheless, Theorem 5 is true as it stands.  The problem occurs with
the last sentence of Theorem 5. Probably the best approach is to point
out first that only equalizers and coequalizers are needed and then only
the $U$-contractible ones.  Then, if we suppose only the
$U$-contractible equalizers exist (any that exist will be preserved by a
functor that has a left adjoint), that is enough to do Theorem 5
(Exercise, using the fact that the underlying functor of a tripleable
functor creates limits) and from that will follow that the
$U$-contractible equalizers exist.

As for Proposition 4, if we suppose that $\Bsc$ has $U$-contractible
equalizers, the dual of Theorem 5 would imply that $U$-contractible
equalizers exist.  Hence sufficient for Proposition 4 is that {\em
either\/} $U$-contractible equalizers or $U$-contractible coequalizers
exist.  Does anyone want to find an example to show that any
completeness hypothesis is necessary?

\item\lb p. 139\rb  (Samuel Eilenberg) The story told at the end of the second
paragraph is not exact.  In fact the word was chosen as the manuscript
was in final preparation.  Nonetheless, the main the point of the story,
the care that went into choosing the name of an important concept,
remains.

General comment about chapters 4 and 8 (C.  Lair).  In many places we
state that some extension of a functor is unique, when in fact it is
only unique up to isomorphism of functors in the functor category.
These occur on p. 153 (Theorem 4), p. 156 (Theorem 2), and implicitly in
p. 293, Theorem 2 and p. 294, Theorem 1.

\item\lb p. 146.\rb C. Lair has told us that Ehresmann proved a more
general form of Kennison's Theorem in Ehresmann \lb 1967a\rb ,
\lb 1967b\rb .

\item\lb p. 162\rb  (C.  Lair).  The sketch for LE categories constructed here
has LE categories with specified limits of finite diagrams as models,
and morphisms of models are functors which preserve the specified
limits.  A similar remark should be made about the sketch for toposes on
p. 165.

\item\lb p. 172\rb  Second sentence:  $\P$ having a left adjoint does not
imply $T$ does.  The sentence and following one should be combined as
follows:  ``Since $\T$ is the composite of a functor and its right
adjoint, it is the functor part of a triple $(T,\eta:1\to T,\mu:T\sp 2\to
T)$.''

\item\lb p. 197\rb  Lemma 3 (Francisco Marmolejo). Dropping the subscript on
the arrows leaves it too ambiguous.  Part (a) should read,
``$D\meet(B\imp\sb AC)=D\meet B\imp\sb DD\meet C$.''

\item\lb p. 200\rb , line $-4$ (Francisco Marmolejo).  The sentence should be
expanded to, ``Observe that any sheaf is $\j$-closed inside any
separated presheaf.  ({\bf Separated} isn't defined until page 233, but
it simply means that in the definition of sheaf in the moddle of page
69, the unique existence is replaced by the assumption that there is at
most one element $x$ such that $X|U\sb i=x\sb i$.)''

\item\lb p. 205\rb  (Francisco Marmolejo).  In the last line of Exercise TPPB,
change ``induce'' to ``constitutes''.

\item\lb p. 213\rb , last line  (Francisco Marmolejo). Should read, ``products
commute with reflexive coequalizers.''  In fact, a product of a fixed
object with any coequalizer is a coequalizer.  This fact follows from
Lemma 6 on page 158-159.

\item\lb p. 214\rb   The reference, third line from bottom, to section 6.4
should be to section 7.3.

\item\lb p. 233\rb   ``Epimorphic family'' should be boldface and indexed.

\item\lb p. 234\rb  second paragraph (J\"urgen Kozlowski): Change Corollary 5
of Section 5.4 to Corollary 8 of Section 5.3.  Also, Exercise CANON
doesn't exist; delete the reference.

\item\lb p. 242\rb   ``Cocontinuous'', in Theorem 12, was not defined.  A
cocontinuous functor is one which preserves all colimits.

\item\lb p. 250\rb   Fourth line is broken.

\item\lb p. 250\rb   Theorem 7 is referred to several times elsewhere as
Freyd's embedding theorem, and should be named as such here.

\item\lb p. 261\rb  second line from bottom:  Freyd's Theorem is Theorem 7 of
7.1, not Theorem 5 of 7.2.

\item\lb p. 293\rb  (Peter Johnstone).  In Exercise (TOTO), the maps should be
strictly increasing rather than nondecreasing.

\item\lb p. 294\rb   We should point out the connections between Theorem 1
here and Theorem 12, p. 242 and Theorem 2, p. 263.

\item\lb p. 295\rb  second line before exercises.  ``Function'' misspelled.

\item\lb p. 295\rb  (Peter Johnstone).  The description of the realizability
topos
is completely incorrect; in particular, the realizability topos is not
a classifying topos, so the reference does not belong here at all.
The reference which {\it does} belong here is to Mulry,

\item\lb p. 296\rb   Same change for Exercise (DLO) as for Exercise (TOTO)
above.

\item\lb p. 297\rb  (Peter Johnstone and many others).  Theorem 1 omits the
very
important fact that models of geometric theories have filtered colimits.

\item\lb p. 300\rb   The statement on line 6 that filtered colimits of regular
functors are regular deserves some discussion, or at least should be
made an exercise!

\item\lb p. 301\rb   In connection with the first sentence beginning on this
page, we now know that the category of orthodox semigroups and their
morphisms is the category of models of an LE-sketch and is regular, but
is not the category of models of an FP-sketch.  (An orthodox semigroup
is one in which the product of idempotents is an idempotent.)  Details
in a forthcoming paper by Wells.

\item\lb p. 302\rb  (Peter Johnstone).  Because models of geometric theories
preserve
filtered colimits (see correction to p. 297), the answer to Exercise
(CYCGRP)(c) is easily seen to be:  No.

\item\lb p. 307\rb  diagram (5).  The two rightmost arrows lack labels.  The
one from $UB$ to $C$ is $c$ and the one from $C$ to $UB$ is $s$.

\item\lb p. 318\rb  (Colin McLarty).  Exercise (DL) should say that all
composites
{\it of length three} are the identity.

\item\lb p. 325\rb  (Peter Johnstone).  In line 15, $(R:C)$ is not a full
subcategory of the comma category $(R,C)$.\end{trivlist}

\title{Category Theory for Computing Science: \\ Update}


\author{Michael Barr and Charles Wells}

\maketitle

Our text, {\bf Category Theory for Computing Science}, Prentice Hall,
1990 (ISBN 0-13-120486-6) has just been published.  We intend to
maintain the text in the sense that programmers maintain their programs,
by keeping a list of known errors and also of additions to the text that
we think might be useful.  (The latter will probably come in spurts as
we go to meetings and find out about wonderful new applications of
category theory to computing science.)

We will periodically
announce new errata and addenda on the category theory bulletin board.
The latest TeX version of the complete list is available by e-mail or
p-mail from either author.

The update consists of three parts: \ref{errors}: A list of errors discovered
so far.  \ref{newtext}: Additional examples, problems and pointers to the
literature. \ref{refs}: Additions to the list of references, pp. 417ff. of
the text.  Page references refer to the text.

Any further corrections or suggestions for additional text will be welcome.

\section{Errors}\label{errors}

\begin{description}

\item\lb p. xv\rb  In the Chapter Dependency Chart, there should be a diagonal
line from Chapter 5 to Chapter 7.

\item\lb p. 92\rb  In Proposition 4.3.12 and its proof, the letter $C$ (not
the script $\Csc$) is
used with two different meanings.  This can be corrected by changing $C$
to $S$ in the first line of the proposition, third line (first occurrence
only), fourth line (last occurrence only) and in the first line of the
proof (second occurrence only).

\item\lb p. 96\rb  The reference to Seely should be \lb 1987\rb
(the entry in the
list of references, p. 425, was incomplete and is updated in the
list of references below.)

\item\lb p. 102\rb  ``The'' not ``the'' in line 7.

\item\lb p. 302\rb  Line $-4ff$ should say, `` In particular, ${\rm\bf Cat}$
is enriched over ${\rm\bf Cat}$ itself, since its hom sets are
themselves categories (with the arrows as objects and the natural
transformations as arrows) and the hom functors preserve the extra
structure.''

\item\lb p.335\rb  In the fourth paragraph of the discussion of the
internal category of modest sets, the sentence, ``We want to describe
this subset as consisting of those relations that are symmetric and
transitive'', should have the following phrase added:
``and double negation closed''.

\item\lb p. 345\rb  Line 2 of the answer to exercise 12.a: the last letter
should be ``B'', not ``b''.

\item\lb p. 365\rb  In the answer to problem 8, $\beta C:\Hom(C,C)\to F(C)$.


\item\lb p. 431\rb  The word ``relation'' should also be indexed on p. 21.

\end{description}

\section{Additional text}\label{newtext}

\begin{description}

\item\lb p. xiii\rb  (Second paragraph) Another collection of papers is
\lb Pitt, Rydeheard, Dybjer, Pitts and Poign\'e, 1989\rb .

\item\lb p. 17\rb  \lb Additional example of category.\rb
Let $\alpha$ be a relation from a set $A$ to a set $B$
and $\beta$ a relation\index{relation}
from $B$ to $C$ (see 1.3.4).  The {\bf
composite} $\beta\o\alpha$ is the relation from $A$ to $C$ defined
as follows: If $x\in A$ and $z\in C$, $(x,z)\in\beta\o\alpha$ if and
only if there is an element $y\in B$ for which $(x,y)\in\alpha$ and
$(y,z)\in\beta$.  With this definition of composition, the {\bf
category of sets and relations} has sets as objects and relations
as arrows.

\item\lb p. 71\rb  \lb New exercise\rb  Show that the category of
sets and relations
is equivalent, in fact isomorphic, to its own dual (see 2.6.7).
Answer: Let $\Rel$ denote the category of sets and relations.
For a relation $\alpha$ from $A$ to $B$, that is, a subset of
$A\x B$, let $\alpha\op$ denote the subset $\{(b,a)\mid (a,b)\in A\x B\}$
of $B\x A$.
Let $F:\Rel\to\Rel\op$ be the identity on objects and
for a relation $\alpha:A\to B$,
let $F(\alpha)=\alpha\op$.  $F(\alpha)$ is a relation from $B$ to
$A$ in $\Rel$, hence a relation from $F(A)=A$ to $F(B)=B$ in $\Rel\op$.
It is easy to check that if $\beta:B\to C$, then $F(\beta\o\alpha)=
\alpha\op\o\beta\op$ in $\Rel$, so $(\beta\o\alpha)\op=\beta\op\o\alpha\op$
in $\Rel\op$.  This says $F(\beta\o\alpha)=F(\beta)\o F(\alpha)$, so
$F$ preserves composition.  The identity relation on $A$ is $\Delta\sb A=
\{(a,a)\mid a\in A\}$, so $\Delta=\Delta\op$ and $F$ preserves
identities.  Since for any relation $\alpha$, $(\alpha\op)\op=\alpha$,
we have $F\o F$ is the identity functor on $\Rel$, so is its own inverse.
Hence  $F$ is an isomorphism.  By Exercise 1, it is therefore an
equivalence of categories.

\item\lb p. 96\rb  The applications of $2$-categories have mushroomed and
include \lb Hoare, Ji Feng and Martin, 1990\rb , \lb Moggi, 1989\rb , and
\lb Power, 1989\rb  in addition to the papers already listed.
%% Goguen has told me about some other papers which I will look up.

\item\lb p. 97\rb  Second paragraph of Section 4.5:  In addition
to generalizing
the Cayley Theorem, the Yoneda Lemma also has as a special case the
embedding of a poset into its down-closed subsets.
Also: set-valued functors are studied further in Sections 11.2 and 14.4.


\item\lb p. 257\rb  Besides \lb Coquand, 1988\rb , Moggi \lb 1989\rb  also uses
the Grothendieck construction in modeling polymorphism.

\item\lb p. 287\rb  Just before the exercise: See also \lb Ehrhard, 1989\rb .

\item\lb p. 318\rb  Add comment: We considered presheaves as actions
in Section
3.2.  They occur in other guises in the categorical and computer science
literature, too.  For example,
a functor $F:A\to\Set$, where $A$ is a set treated as a
discrete category, is
a ``bag'' of elements of $A$.  If $a\in A$, the set $F(a)$ denotes the
multiplicity to which $a$ occurs in $A$.  See \lb Taylor, 1989\rb  for
an application in computing science.

\item\lb p. 325\rb  Goguen \lb 1990\rb  has developed a sheaf
semantics for object
oriented programs.
