It is the 2-truncation of "symmetric simplicial sets" as presheaves
on finite cardinals, cf (*).

Curiously, symmetric simplicial sets have been rarely considered.
Even if simplicial complexes (well-known!) are a symmetric notion and
have a natural embedding in symmetric simplicial sets.  While
simplicial sets are a directed notion, used as an undirected one in
classical Algebraic Topology.

Why the "curious" omission of this topos from most discussions of combinatorial topology ?

The introduction of ordered simplices by Eilenberg 60 years ago is usually explained in
subjective terms like the annoying extra degeneracies that had to be eliminated in the
previous theory . However there is a objective requirement clearly pointed out by Gabriel &
Zisman. (They spoke of Kelley spaces but that was a mistake due to Kelley's excellent
exposition of the k-spaces of Hurewicz). The requirement is that geometric realization r (left
adjoint to "singular" s) be left exact, so that products and equations on fleshed out spaces
can be the reflection simply of the same operations on the combinatorial models.

If we construe spaces as Johnstone did (or in many other possible ways) as forming
themselves a topos, the the above requirement is simply that r/s constitute a geometric
morphism of toposes. To understand the qualitative distinction between the possible
codomain combinatorial toposes, it is very helpful to note their role as CLASSIFYING toposes.
That role is not always easy  to grasp in the specific if one starts with primitives and axioms
for a first order theory, tries to present the corresponding Lindenbaum category, then takes
sheaves on that, etc. Fortunately in some cases one can bypass that presentation process
because the resulting small category is already well known.

Preheaves on the category of non-empty finite posets clearly classify arbitrary non-trivial
distributive lattices in any Grothendieck topos. In other words an s/r teory  can be based on
an "interval" object in spaces that has a DL structure. If we want that to factor through the
subtopos of simplicial sets, we note that the latter is the classifier for those special DLs that
are totally ordered, which translates geometrically to a condition on an interval that the
square is a union of two triangles; since "union" depends on the topology of space, that
condition is often not true for DLs that  at first glance look like intervals.

There are other relevant subtoposes (ie positive classes of DLs) for example those for which
the canonical map from the generic one I to the truth-object is actually a homomorphism
with respect to both lattice operations.

But the presheaves on non-empty finite sets is the subtopos that classifies Boolean algebras.
The generic BA is the obvious one. It does not really describe well its relation to the total
orderings to call it the "synmmetric version". As the one contains all small categories, this
one analogously contains all groupoids. It can still receive an r/s pair as required if only a
space with a BA structure is used as the "interval". The natural choice for that is the in finite
dimensional sphere, which indeed has a continuous BA structure that contains the usual
interval as a subDL. If only this had been known 60 years ago, we could have done without
the simplicial sets, for this singular theory reads to the same homotopy category.  Note that
any Grothendieck topos (including ss!) has a canonical BA object, hence enjoys a canonical
r/s theory valued here.

Marco, thanks for that, this is really nice.  It hadn't occurred to me
to extend undirected graphs to higher dimensions but ... of course!

While "symmetric" is technically correct terminology here (and indeed
graph theorists often define undirected graphs as the symmetric case of
directed graphs), "undirected" conveys the appropriate intuition that
the edges and higher-dimensional cells have no specific orientation.
Whereas the automorphism group of a directed n-cell is the trivial
group, that of an undirected n-cell is S_N where N=n+1, i.e. undirected
n-cells are permitted to "flop around" in all N! possible ways.
Moreover the group as a whole behaves like a single cell with regard to
identification: if one of the N! copies of an undirected edge is
identified with a copy of another undirected edge, all copies are
identified bijectively, i.e. the two undirected cells are identified.

So without taking issue with Marco's terminology "symmetric" here, since
it is correct and natural, I would nevertheless like to suggest that in
the context of simplicial complexes, and with ordinary graphs as a
precedent, that "undirected" be considered an acceptable synonym for
"symmetric".

But that connection leads to another that hadn't previously occurred to
me (though again this is unlikely to be news to at least some).  This is
the question of an appropriate language for the signature of simplicial
complexes in general.

Each operation can be named with a lambda-calculus term of the form
\xyz.xyzzy, that is, a string of (distinct of course) variables followed
by another string of the same variables with repetitions or omissions
allowed.  Dually to undirected simplicial complexes being a special case
of (directed) simplicial complexes, the language for the latter is the
special case of that for the former in which the body of the lambda term
preserves the order of the formal parameter list; the smallest term thus
disallowed is \xy.yx.

In particular s and t (source and target) arise as respectively \xy.x
and \xy.y: given an edge, bind x and y to its source and target
respectively and return the designated vertex.  Similarly \x.xx denotes
the distinguished self-loop at a given vertex x (these being reflexive
graphs since we allow contraction).  The lambda terms with N=n+1
parameters have as domain the set of n-cells.

The one operation that undirected graphs have that is absent in the
general directed case is \xy.yx, which names the other member of the
group of automorphic copies of an undirected edge.  These two copies
always travel together (literally as a group), justifying the intuition
that the group of both of them constitutes a single edge (or n-cell).
For general n these copies of a given cell are named by the linear
lambda terms, those with exactly one occurrence of each formal
parameter.  Any given cell of a graph attaches to the rest of the graph
at various points around that cell, but graph homomorphisms cannot
disturb those points of attachment or incidence, though it can certainly
map the cell to any of the N! isomorphic copies of itself.

It should be pointed out that "undirected graph" as a "special case" of
"directed graph" has its syntactic rather than semantic meaning here, in
the sense that UGraph (undirected graphs) does not embed in DGraph
(directed graphs), at least not in the expected way.  Consider a graph
with two vertices x,y, two edges from x to y, and two edges from y to x.
   If a graph homomorphism identifies the two edges from x to y, it need
not identify the other two edges in DGraph, but it does need to identify
them in UGraph.

Unless I've overlooked some subtlety, 2-UGraph does however embed in the
expected way in 2-DGraph, where 2 = {0,1} (= V in enriched parlance) are
the possible cardinalities of "homsets", i.e. at most one edge in each
direction.  This is because the implicit pairing in 2-DGraph perfectly
mimics the explicit pairing in 2-UGraph.   This would explain why graph
theorists, who usually work in 2-DGraph, encounter no ambiguity of the
Set-UGraph < Set-DGraph kind when they define an undirected graph as
simply a symmetric graph, one with no one-way streets.

W.r.t. to the discussion on intuitionism and disjunction I would like to
remark that this relation depends heavily on whether the ambient setting is
predicative or not. In an impredicative setting like toposes (or the Calculus
of Constructions) one may define disjunction and existential quantification
`a la Russell-Prawitz by quantification over \Omega (that's what (some)
logicians call impredicative, i.e. the possibility to quantify over
propositions and thus also predicates).
However in a first order setting this is not possible. E.g. if one considers
Heyting arithmetic with ist usual axioms and as logic the
\neg,\wedge,->,\forall fragment of first order logic then all formulas are
provably double negation closed. This shows that disjunction and existence
are not definable from the rest via first order logic.

So far the logical side. What Paul Levy had in mind was slightly different
as I understand it. Categories of domains (cpos with \bot) are cartesian
closed and have weak finite sums but certainly no proper finite sums
(since every map has a fixpoint). For modelling his CBPV paradigm he needs
in addition a category of predomains which is bicartesian closed. The former
is an example of a ccc which is not bicartesian but can be embedded into the
latter which is.

So one doesn't get for free the finite sums from a ccc which is problematic
both in logic and semantics of computation.

A comment on combinatorial models for spaces : there is the notion of a
CW-poset (due to Bjoerner) which is a poset that can be identified with
the poset of cells of a regular CW-complex; those posets have very
special properties, but from a homotopy point of view, every space is
weakly homotopy equivalent to a regular CW-complex, so every space has a
``CW-poset-model''. Taking the nerve of this poset yields a
``simplicial-set-model'' of the same space; geometrically, the passage
from the poset to its nerve corresponds to barycentric subdivision. Now,
there is an old paper by Daniel Kan (Amer. J. Math. 79 (1957) 449-476,
section 10), where he shows that the barycentric subdivision of a
simplicial set actually has the structure of a symmetric simplicial set.
So, to some extent, symmetric simplicial sets are doubly subdivided
regular CW-complexes. What I wanted to point out is that in the
progression CW-poset->simplicial set->symmetric simplicial set, the
combinatorial information about the space is not increasing, but rather
decreasing, which is one possible argument in favour of simplicial sets
versus symmetric simplicial sets. Another argument for the category of
simplicial sets is that it is a topos which contains the category of
small categories as a full reflective monoidal subcategory. A third
argument is the ubiquitous occurence of simplicial cotriple resolutions.

In his pursuit of stacks, Grothendieck raises the question of what is
the structure on a small category A, which ensures that the presheaf
topos A^ may be endowed with a homotopy theory equivalent to the
homotopy theory of spaces (such a category is called a test-category) or
with the homotopy theory of spaces above a given space (such a category
is called a local-test-category). In the presence of an r/s adjunction
like in Lavwere's message above, the criteria of being local-test or
test are easily spelled out:

A is local-test iff for each object a of A, the projection A[a]\times
\Omega_A\to A[a] realises to a weak equivalence, where \Omega_A is the
subobject classifier of A^ and A[a] is the presheaf represented by a.

A is test iff A is local-test and the nerve of A is weakly contractible.

With best regards,

                       Clemens Berger.

Dear Colleagues,

This is to announce a new release of a Java application for storage and
display of finitely presented categories and functors among them.

GDCT is a tool for the creation, editing, display and storage of finitely
presented categories. Categories can be opened and saved from local files
as well as loaded from a user-specified server. Open categories can be
displayed graphically, and the graphical display can be manipulated (in 3
dimensions) and stored. Several tools for testing properties of objects
and arrows can be applied.

Functors between stored categories can also be created and stored. Open
functors can be displayed as diagrams and with a domain/codomain display.

This version of GDCT contains some enhancements:

- Moved to a desktop-style interface, where multiple categories and
functors can be opened in their own respective windows

- Implemented pullback, pushout, create product, create sum, and partial
order category tools.


A built-in help system describes how to use GDCT.

The application is available for download at
 http://mathcs.mta.ca/research/rosebrugh/gdct/
and is linked from
 http://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/

Instructions for setting up GDCT are are on the Web pages:

- users may download a zipped archive providing the application;

- source code is available.


Graphical Database for Category Theory was developed by Jeremy Bradbury,
Ian Rutherford, M. Graves, J. Tweedle and R. Rosebrugh with support from
NSERC Canada.

We are interested in any response from users, and would also appreciate
receiving any reports of difficulties in function or usability.

Bob Rosebrugh

As Clemens Berger reminds us, the category of small categories
is a reflective subcategory of simplicial sets, with a reflector that
preserves finite products. But as I mentioned, there is a similar
"advantage" for the Boolean algebra classifier (=presheaves on non-empty
finite cardinals, or "symmetric" simplicial sets):
The category of small groupoids is reflective in this topos, with the
reflector preserving finite products. Thus the Poincare' groupoid of a
simplicial complex is directly available. (The simplicial complexes are
merely the objects generated weakly by their points, a relation which
defines a cartesian closed reflective subcategory of any topos.)

It is not clear how one is to measure the loss or gain of combinatorial
information in composing the various singular and realization functors
between these different models. Is there such a measure?

Undirected versus directed

Going along with the last messages of C Berger and FW Lawvere, I
would like to list the following parallel notions, undirected versus
directed. Of course, it is not a question of saying which is better,
but only of separating them to make things clearer.

---

Undirected:

- symmetric simplicial sets (sss)
- simplicial complexes (classical)
= sets with distinguished subsets
= sss where each simplex is determined by its vertices
- undirected graphs
- groupoids (fundamental groupoids)
- abelian groups (homology groups)
- spaces
- classical metric spaces
- undirected algebraic topology
---

Directed:

- simplicial sets
- "directed simplicial complexes" (not classical)
= sets with distinguished words
= simplicial sets where each simplex is determined by (the family of)
its vertices
- directed graphs
- categories (fundamental categories)
- preordered abelian groups ("directed homology groups")
- "directed spaces" (preordered, locally preordered, etc.)
- generalised metric spaces (Lawvere)
- "directed algebraic topology"
---

Spaces are plainly an undirected structure. Note that their singular
simplicial set already has a natural symmetric structure (by
"permuting vertices" on tetrahedra); there is no need of symmetrising
it and loosing information.

Classical algebraic topology is mostly undirected (since spaces,
groupoids, abelian groups are so), but it has also used directed
structures, like simplicial sets, for undirected purposes: simulating
spaces and computing undirected algebraic structures, like groupoids
and homology groups.
The study of "directed algebraic topology" is quite recent. (There
are some papers on that in my web page, from which one can see the
literature; present applications are concerned with concurrency and
rewriting. But the general aim should be modeling non-reversible
phenomena.)

Finally, I would like to point out - once more - that the term
"simplicial complex" is highly confusing: this notion (as Bill
recalls) is a simplified version of a symmetric simplicial set, while
the corresponding simplified version of a simplicial set is a "set
with distinguished words" (the reflexive cartesian closed subcategory
of "objects determined by their vertices", in the presheaf topos of
simplicial sets). But I have noticed that people can get nervous
about terminology, and it might be better to forget about this last
point.

I am not sure if I really understand what is the target of this discussion,
but I would like to make some comments to Bill's messages:

The Poincare' groupoid is (up to an equivalence) nothing but the largest
Galois groupoid, and it is directly available as soon as one has what I call
Galois structure in my several papers, if we assume that every object of the
ground category has a universal covering. This is certainly the case for
every locally connected topos with coproducts and enough projectives.
Therefore this is certainly the case for every presheaf topos. Therefore
what Bill means by "directly available" should be not "available without
going through geometric realization" but just "can be calculated as the
result of reflection" (probably this is exactly what Bill had in mind).

Moreover, it was Grothendieck's observation that Galois/fundamental
groupoids are to be defined as quotients of certain equivalence relations -
in fact kernel pairs, and this observation was used by many authors in topos
theory and elsewhere; my own observation (1984) then was that one can make
Galois theory purely categorical by using not "quotients" but "images under
a left adjoint" (the first prototype for me was actually not Grothendieck's
but Andy Magid's "componentially locally strongly separable" Galois theory
of commutative rings). What I am trying to conclude is that the
Galois/fundamental groupoids actually arise not from anything simplicial but
from abstract category theory: it is just a result of a game with adjoint
functors between categories with pullbacks.

In another message Bill says: "A similar lacuna of explicitness occurs in
many papers on Galois theory where pregroupoids are an intermediate step ;
the description of  the pregroupoid concept is really just a presentation
of the monoid of endomaps of the 4-element set..." Assuming that everyone
understands that this is not about classical Galois theory (I don't think
somebody like J.-P. Serre ever mentions pregroupoids) and not about what
Anders Kock calls pregroupoids, let me again return to the categorical
Galois theory:

If p : E ---> B is an "extension" in a category C, R its kernel pair, and F
: C ---> X the left adjoint involved in a given Galois theory, then one
wants to define the Galois groupoid Gal(E,p) as F(R) = the image of R under
F (I usually write I instead of F, but in an email message this does not
look good...). But if our extension p : E ---> B is not normal, then, since
F usually does not preserve pullbacks, F(R) is not a groupoid - it is a
weaker structure, the "equational part" of groupoid structure. This weaker
structure is still good enough to define its internal actions in X and these
internal actions classify covering objects over B split by (E,p). Hence this
weaker structure needs a name and I called it "pregroupoid" (I did not know
that this term was already overused for almost the same and for unrelated
concepts). I cannot speak for everyone, but for my own purposes there are
actually several possible candidates for the notion of pregroupoid and half
of them can certainly be defined as monoid actions for a specific monoid,
like the one Bill mentions. However, in each case we deal with a "very
small" category actions and it is a triviality to observe that that category
can be replaced with a monoid. Essentially, what you need is to check that
the terminal object (in your category of pregroupoids) has either no proper
subobjects or only one such, which must be initial. In this observation -
due to Max Kelly, about the categories monadic over powers of Sets being
monadic over Sets, one usually says "strictly initial"; but we can omit
"strictly" here since it is about a topos.

In the topos situation, we are really concerned with intuitionistic
provability, not with proof equality.  A model of intuitionistic
provability is a bi-Heyting algebra.  I agree that, in the provability
setting, disjunction can be encoded in terms of impredicative universal
quantification,

However, when we are concerned with proof-equality, this encoding doesn't
work as a translation of equational theories.  I mean that the eta-law for
the (encoded) sum types cannot be proved in the beta-eta-theory for
polymorphism.  (If we incorporate Plotkin-Abadi logic into the target
theory into, then the encoding works, if I recall correctly, but the
target theory isn't equational any more.)

Agreed.

> So far the logical side. What Paul Levy had in mind

I didn't have CBPV in mind; that is a calculus for effects (such as
divergence).

My point was just that intuitionistic logic corresponds to "pure" type
theory: no divergence or other effects.  Therefore a bi-ccc is required to
model it.  Categories that are suitable for modelling effects, such as the
category of domains, won't do for modelling intuitionistic proofs,

Admittedly, if we follow John's suggestion of weakening beta-eta laws into
morphisms a la Neil Ghani, then we won't need a bi-ccc any more.  All I am
saying is that, *if* we require the eta law for function types, then we
should also require it for sum types.

A couple of remarks about this.  First the trivial one: "bi-ccc" is a
misleading term (I've used it myself, with the same confusion induced
in others), when all you mean is a ccc with coproducts.

More importantly, when you look at the structure of proofs in
intuitionist logic, you find that sum and product are not really dual
- though I have to admit this is very much a matter of presentation.
The problem is an old one: Zucker (in the early 70's I think) pointed
out that normalization steps are not the same as cut elimination
steps, particularly for disjunction.  I looked at this in my 1977
thesis, using natural deduction (in the Gentzen-Prawitz formulation)
for the logic (this has the advantage over the sequent calculus of
giving a category without need for any equivalence relation on
derivations).  Taking eta and beta (one an expansion, the other a
reduction) as 2-cells, I looked at the 2-categorical structure of the
connectives (and quantifiers, though really forall and exists are very
similar respectively to conjunction and disjunction, not
surprisingly).  It's easy to see that conjunction is a weak adjoint
without any further structure, but disjunction is NOT - unless you add
some permuting conversions (equivalences): in fact exactly the
permuting rewrites Prawitz had already identified earlier.  And
function types are a mess in this setting, unless you make the
conjunction a real product (again by introducing equivalences - this
time just beta and eta).  You can find a sketch of all this in two
extended abstracts I published: one in the Durham 1977 Category
Meeting ("Applications of sheaves ...", SLNM 753), and the other in
LICS 1987.  (Both are available on my webpage.)

(BTW - this was all done long before Ghani looked at the matter
... Barry Jay also subsequently looked at this.  But the higher
dimensional structure of intuitionist logic is still largely
un-studied, and merits serious attention.)

I am in the process of editing my correspondence 1982-1991 with AG which has
been latexed through George Malsiniotis for appearing as part of an Appendix
to a published edition of `Pursuing Stacks'.  I came across the following
extract  which seemed to me to contain points of general interest about
mathematical methodology and sociology, so I give this below, to invite
comments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 from a letter dated 14 June, 1983,

Your idea of writing a ``frantically speculative" article on
groupoids seems to me a very good one. It is the kind of thing
which has traditionally been lacking in mathematics since the very
beginnings, I feel, which is one big drawback in comparison to all
other sciences, as far as I know. Of course, no creative
mathematician can afford not to ``speculate", namely to do more or
less daring guesswork as an indispensable source of inspiration.
The trouble is that, in obedience to a stern tradition, almost
nothing of this appears in writing, and preciously little even in
oral communication. The point is that the disrepute of
``speculation" or ``dream" is such, that even as a strictly
private (not to say secret!) activity, it has a tendency to
vegetate - much like the desire and drive of love and sex, in too
repressive an environment. Despite the ``repression", in the one
or two years before I unexpectedly was led to withdraw from the
mathematical milieu and to stop publishing, it was more or less
clear to me that, besides going on pushing ahead with foundational
work in SGA and EGA, I was going to write a wholly science-fiction
kind [of] book on ``motives'', which was then the most fascinating
and mysterious mathematical being I had come to meet so far. As my
interests and my emphasis have somewhat shifted since, I doubt I
am ever going to write this book - still less anyone else is going
to, presumably. But whatever I am going to write in mathematics, I
believe a major part of it will be ``speculation" or ``fiction",
going hand in hand with painstaking, down-to-earth work to get
hold of the right kind of notions and structures, to work out
comprehensive pictures of still misty landscapes. The notes I am
writing up lately are in this spirit, but in this case the
landscape isn't so remote really, and the feeling is rather that,
as for the specific program I have been out for is concerned,
getting everything straight and clear shouldn't mean more than a
few years work at most for someone who really feels like doing it,
maybe less. But of course surprises are bound to turn up on one's
way, and while starting with a few threads in hand, after a while
they may have multiplied and become such a bunch that you cannot
possibly grasp them all, let alone follow.

Dear George,

   Concerning undirected graphs, the Boolean algebra classifier, and
the intermediate sub-topos that suffices for groupoids:

   The special feature of these toposes I wanted to emphasize is not that
some of them can be generated by monoids, but rather (whether one splits
idempotents or not) that the site of operators is itself a full
subcategory of the category of sets. This is a small part of the point
that Vaughn wanted to make, I believe. Having the direct visualization of
this system of operators available as merely maps between certain small
sets is a useful auxiliary to formal presentations of the d,s kind.
As you mention, a basic way in which such presheaves can arise is by
applying a non-exact functor F to a group; the fact that the exponents on
the group are just these ordinary sets explains why we obtain an object
in this sort of topos (which can serve as a presentation of another group,
if desired).

   As noted in my unpublished (but widely distributed) paper on toposes
generated by codiscrete objects, the Yoneda embedding in these cases
produces of course a full sub-category of a topos, one which looks
exactly like (a piece of) the category of sets; of course this is not
the discrete inclusion, but its dialectical opposite, the codiscrete one.

Dear Bill,

Indeed, there were no monoids in Vaughan's original message of February 28,
but since you have mentioned them in your message of March 1, and since you
were talking there about "...lacuna of explicitness ... in many papers on
Galois theory...", I simply wanted to say that:

I do not see any relevance of these kinds of presentations in Galois theory
(apart from the fact the internal pre-whatever-s in a category X form an
X-valued presheaf category).

On the other hand Galois theory is not the end of the World, and I think the
beauty and importance of those your ideas is clear to everyone who saw them.

Putting myself in risk of making my message boring, I would like to make one
more remark concerning your last message and Galois theory:

You say: "...applying a non-exact functor F to a group..." - true and fine,
but I have actually mentioned F(R) for R being not a group, but another
extreme case of a groupoid, namely an equivalence relation. What seems to be
most amazing is, that, because F preserves not-all-but-some pullbacks, there
are beautiful examples where R is an equivalence relation and F(R) is a
group; in simple words, F creates a group out of nothing! The classical
example, as you know, is: if R is the kernel pair of a universal covering
map E ---> B of a "good" connected topological space B, and F is the functor
sending ("good") topological spaces to the sets of their connected
components, then F(R) is the fundamental group of B. The same thing is true
in other Galois theories of course.

George

I just want to remark that the second order encoding of disjunction `a la
Russell-Prawitz is not bound to work only for provability. E.g. in PER(N)
it holds that (\forall X) (A->X) -> (B->X) -> X is isomorphic to A + B.
(A related result for "polymorphic" natural numbers was proved by Peter Freyd
and extension of this result to polymorphic encodings free algebras was obtained
a bit later by Hyland, Robinson and Rosolini).
If your data type A lives in PER(N) then the 2nd order order encoding of
existential quantification

    (\exists x:A) P(x) \equiv (\forall Q) ((\forall x:A) P(x) -> Q) -> Q

is isomorphic to (\Sigma x:A) P(x) and thus we can project out the witness.
In the extended calculus of constructions XCC where Prop (i.e. PER(N)) closed
under small sums one can syntactically prove

      (\exists x:A) P(x)  \equiv  (\Sigma x:A) P(x)

and thus one can extract witnesses from proves of (\exists x:A) P(x).
Admittedly, this equivalence is not an isomorphism in general but it is in
PER(N) and a lot of other relizability models. (A tricky counterexample for
the general case was proided by Ivar Rummelhoff a cople of years ago!)

Thus in an impredicative setting the positive operations turn out as 2nd order
definable from -> and \forall.

The main defect of Domains (with bottom) as a model for proofs is that every
type = domain contains an element, namely bottom. But weak coproducts are
definitely available.

If one integrates dynamics = rewriting = computation into the model by
considering 2-categories things might turn out as different. However, there
are no indications (as far as I know) that this 2-categorical setting makes
sums definable from lambda calculus.

Thomas

PS Peter Freyd has remarked that the early constructivists (implicitly)
considered as an earmark of constructivity that

   (E)  |= \exists x:A. P(x)  entails that  |= P([a/x]  for some  a : 1 -> A

I am not going to contradict that BUT it definitely fails already for boolean
toposes: consider the topos Psh(G) for G a nontrivial group and A the
representable presheaf then it holds in Psh(G) that  \exists x:A. x=x
although A hasn't any global section.
Of course, Peter Freyd's glueing argument shows that in the free topos (E)
holds. This certainly is a most beautiful argument. Nevertheless, I think
it doesn't tell that (E) is necessarily an earmark of constructivity since
the free models (i.e. formulas modulo provability) are not necessarily
the intended models. Moreover, (E) holds in realizability models (as long as
type A is \neg\neg-separated, i.e. an assembly).

Dear colleagues.

I am developing category theory software.

It includes objects, morphisms, diagrams, functors, direct and inverse
limits. Software math categories include vector spaces, modules over
fuclidean rings, finite sets, finitely generated commutative algebras. The
software works with algebraic fields, complex and real field, Galois fields.
The software supports following functors: Tensor products, Hom, Ext, Tor.
Additional software feature is Homology calculations.

The software  requires .NET 2.0

You can download sofware from http://sourceforge.net/projects/categorytheory
.

Recent instructions you can download from
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/categorytheory/CategoryTheory-doc-0.9.zip?download

If you wish improvement of the sofware vizit its forum
http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=160444

Yours  sincerely       Petr.

Dear George

By a presentation in mathematics I mean generators and relations for an
algebraic structure of a certain kind. Occasionally we are fortunate to
have also another more direct description of the same algebra, which it is
useful to make explicit; a well known example of the usefulness of making
explicit such a conceptual (as opposed to syntactical) description is the
pair of definitions for the algebra of operators that defines the notion
of simplicial set.

In your 2001 book with Borceux, Definition 7.2.1 involves five generators
and five relations. Sometimes this is augmented by symmetry.

What is actually being presented ?  a certain full finite subcategory of
the category of finite sets. Why should diagrams of this shape occur so
often and be transported by functors even when they do not satisfy any
exactness ? That is especially evident in the case of the Amitsur complex
on page 264: the family of powers of a given object is a functor of the
exponents, which are sets from that little category.

That groupoids form a subcategory of the topos permits to take images, in
the topos, of maps between groupoids; surprisingly, that can be useful.

I prefer to consider one more finite set, so that "associativity" is a
structure even when it is not an exact property (and analogously in the
case of categories vs truncated simplicial sets - the question is how
truncated). Then to be a groupoid is just a pullback-preservation
condition.

By a presentation in mathematics I mean exactly the same thing, I agree with
every word you said in this paragraph, and I know that what we call today
Lawvere theories was your beautiful discovery along this lines to thoughts.

I am sorry, what is "presented" in Definition 7.2.1 can of course be
considered as a subcategory of the category of finite sets, but certainly
not full (because, say, there are no arrows from C_1 to C_2). I suppose you
have noticed this, and so you are suggesting to modify the Definition
7.2.1 - since in "all" examples in fact there are more arrows. Well, one
could do so, but there is also a good reason not to do so: those five
generators and five relations is exactly the minimum needed to define
internal actions (I have actually first used this definition in my CT90
paper "Precategories and Galois theory" and many other people used similar
definitions for other purposes, probably long before).

Having said this, I again agree with every word of the rest of your message.
Can you accept the fact I agree with it and at the same time I do like
Definition 7.2.1? Note that if we go one step down in dimension, there will
be reflexive graphs whose "theory" is a full subcategory of sets and just
graphs whose "theory" is not. Are you telling me that this is a good reason
to forget the notion of graph, and use only reflexive graphs?

George

My take on monoids vs. initial segments of Delta, FinSet, etc. as sites
for a category of presheaves is that it is like Hasse diagrams vs.
posets, or axioms vs. theories.  The former should be understood only as
a convenient representation of its idempotent completion, just as a
Hasse diagram of a poset is a convenient representation of its reflexive
transitive closure, or an axiom system a convenient representation of a
theory.

In the case of reflexive undirected graphs as a presheaf category, the
monoid Set(2,2) works as a site but is not idempotent closed (the two
constant functions don't split).  In the category of sets with one or
two elements however, the terminator splits the constant functions, as
it does in any category with a terminator if one defines "constant
morphism" as an idempotent split by the terminator.

The benefit of idempotent closed sites is that equivalent presheaf
categories must then have equivalent sites, as I learned from Jiri
Adamek's post on this list the other week asking for the earliest
reference to that fact.  I subsequently learned the proof from Borceux
Vol I (Theorem 6.5.11, where idempotent completion is called by its
synonym Cauchy completion).

My question was about the theory, for which Bill pointed out a nice
axiomatization.

As it turns out, the earliest reference answering my original question
may well be this very list!  At the risk of embarrassing Marco Grandis
(to whom I therefore apologize in advance), the 1999 monoid-on-graphs
thread at

   http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/catlist/1999/monoid-on-graphs

includes two posts by Marco, the first asserting that FinSet could be
substituted for Delta in the definition of reflexive graphs as
presheaves on the truncation of that site, the second recanting a day
later and pointing out the impact of the twist:2->2 in creating what he
called at the time involutive reflexive graphs.  Marco subsequently
wrote about symmetric simplicial complexes as the higher-dimensional
generalization of the impact of the twist.

So far no one has mentioned an earlier explicit reference than this
March 1999 one in response to my question.  Bill mentioned Sets for
Mathematics, but that was 2003.

I did however receive two private responses from a La Jolla 1965
participant who first protested that surely presheaves on the site I
asked about were *directed* graphs, but then with the same one-day pause
as Marco pointed out the role of the twist in binding together the two
directions of an undirected edge.  (I assume this is history repeating
itself and not the email counterpart of a standup routine the experts do
from time to time for our edutainment.  In standup, timing is as
important as content.)

My own excuse for not noticing Marco's 1999 posts, or for that matter
Francois Lamarche's citation question sparking that whole thread, is
that I was in Hanover that week exhibiting at CeBIT what Guinness
Records 2000 subsequently listed as the world's smallest webserver
(p.162, nestled interestingly when the book is closed).  Bad timing on
my part, that was a useful thread.

It's impressive what can come out of a simple request for citations on
this list.

Vaughan

Hmmm, a paper entitled Funcotrial Generic Filters was written
July 2005, abstract to ASL, where you can observe ejecting on=20
initial segments towards models. What it might do on preshaeves
was sent to a conference a month ago. Like I had told the list there=20
were papers I published over several years ago on functors computing models
on Hasse diagrams.=20=20
I'm not in a position to escalate and have to keep you on a holding
as to what it was doing on sheaves. On the surface it appears as if
we are living in parallel worlds getting a message through.=20

[note from moderator: resent due to faulty From: ]

I've been following the recent posts on undirected graphs
with interest. But I have a question. I think it's being said
that undirected graphs are the same as directed graphs with
involution. (Presheaves on the full subcategory of SET determined
by 1 and 2, or just 2.) Which is nice but what about loops?
The involution might fix a loop or not. So wouldn't we be
getting undirected graphs with two kinds of loops, whole loops
and semiloops? What am I missing?

There has been some 'work in progress' at Bangor on this very question
for the past 8 years. This is intended to present a categorical approach
to graph theory to workers in combinatorics, and is not intended for
category theorists.  The current draft, 06.04, is available at

http://www.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/public/mathematics/research/preprints/06/
(follow the link 06.04 to 06_04.pdf).

We do indeed discuss two types of loop, which we call 'loops' and 'bands'.

Ronnie is away today, but may well add his own comment tomorrow.

Best wishes, Chris Wensley

Dear Bob,

Involutive graphs are what you are saying, of course. If I had to
choose, I would take this as my favoured notion of "undirected
graph", because it is a presheaf topos on a very simple site.

A graph theorist would probably say that an "undirected graph" is
what you are hinting at, which amounts to taking the involutive
graphs where all loops are fixed by the involution (or the ones where
no loop is fixed, except the trivial ones?). Then, he might want to
forget about trivial loops, and allow vertices with no loops.

Being in a category list, another reason of "preferring" the first
notion might be:

- a category has an underlying graph,
- an involutive category has an underlying involutive graph,
- involutive categories where all endomorphisms are fixed by the
involution are rather unnatural; not to mention the ones where no
endomorphism is fixed except the identities.

Of course, there might be reasons in favour of the other choices, or
of considering different choices at a time. Life is complicated and
mathematics too. Even working in category theory, I think we should
avoid being too "categorical"...

Best regards

Marco

Dear all,
  Yes, there are two kinds of loops in the topos of right
actions of the four-element monoid A, where A consists of endomaps of
the two-element set. Consider for example the concrete structure of the
truth-value object in that topos, which is forced to contain a truth-value
called "foray". Rather than as "semi"loops, my colleagues and I usually
think of them as one-lane in the sense that some other edges are really
two lanes, related by the involution operator in the site.

  My old paper "Qualitative distinctions..." tried to make the point that
there are several precise toposes all deserving the rough name of "graph"
or "network" and that each of these precise toposes may have a role to
play. For example, in any given topos, for any given object L, the
category of objects over L, or "L-labelled graphs" (which in practice may
serve as a category of networks) is another topos of "graphs".

  In my experience it is important to consider the whole topos in order to
get good exactness properties but, moreover, because the truth-value
object and other specific objects which may seem rather far from an
initial prejudice about what one wants the objects to mean, nonetheless
turn out in a systematic theory to play a key role in representing
concepts directly related to the original particular subject matter.
A simple example is the representability of gender and moitie in the topos
of kinship systems. This example is treated briefly in Conceptual
Mathematics and in more detail, (again actually involving several related
toposes rather than a single choice) in "Kinship and mathematical
categories".

Yes, you'll get two kind of loops. This explains why in topological
graph theory books sometimes you'll find a remark like "we will count
loops once" or "we will count loops twice" (in the first case, sometimes
loops are depicted as segments going out of vertices with a dashed
ending). The problem is that the standard representation for undirected
graphs (subsets of unordered pairs) fails to distinguish between the two
kind of loops. The presheaf representation makes this distinction
clear.

In most cases you can forget about this problem, but when studying
covering the difference is huge: a loop fixed by the involution is
covered by an edge, whereas a pair of loops exchanged by the involution
are covered by a line. We discussed this issue at some length in our
paper "Fibrations of graphs" (Discrete Math., 2002).

I wouldn't call this a "failure" of the set-of-unordered-pairs notion of
undirected graph, which should be understood in 2-enriched (2 = 0->1)
terms rather than Set-enriched.  In my March 1 post I distinguished the
"set-enriched" or presheaf graph categories Set-DGraph and Set-UGraph
from the "2-enriched" graph categories 2-DGraph and 2-UGraph ("homsets"
of edges are either 0 or 1, i.e. empty or singleton), pointing out that
2-UGraph was a full subcategory of 2-DGraph but Set-UGraph was not a
full subcategory of 2-DGraph, via the same mechanism that creates two
kinds of loops in Set-UGraph.

There is only one kind of loop in 2-UGraph, which category theory is
faithful to when this kind of undirected graph is properly described in
categorical language.  One description would be as the full subcategory
of Set-UGraph (= Set^M^op for M the monoid Set(2,2)) induced by the
evident functor Nonempty:Set->2 collapsing nonempty homsets to
singletons; it would be nice if 2-UGraph arose more naturally, e.g. as
some sort of 2-enriched presheaf category, though I don't see how.

My definition of 2-UGraph (undirected graphs with at most one edge from
any given vertex to another) as "the full subcategory of Set-UGraph (=
Set^M^op for M the monoid Set(2,2)) induced by the evident functor
Nonempty:Set->2 collapsing nonempty homsets to singletons" was an
attempt to say "2-UGraph is a retract of Set-UGraph" with both too few
words and too many.

2-UGraph is the full subcategory of Set-UGraph consisting of graphs with
at most one edge per "homset", and at the same time the quotient of
Set-UGraph arising from identifying all members of each homset of each
graph.  I.e. a retract.

This is something of an eye-opener for me as I have for decades thought
of the undirected graph (of the one-edge-per-homset kind) as the
algebraically impoverished cousin of the directed graph.  I am tickled
pink to find it arising as a retract of a presheaf category, and
moreover without either of the two quirks that have been pointed out for
the more general undirected graphs allowing multiple edges per homset
(Set-UGraph has two types of distinguished loop, and does not embed in
Set-DGraph).

Dear Vaughan,

    I hope you will also like the following remark:
Inside any presheaf or other topos there is a canonical subcategory
which is an adjoint retract with the adjoint preserving finite products
(but not equalizers). This category is therefore cartesian closed in the
obvious way, but its special property is that any two maps from X to Y are
distinguished by a map from 1 to X. It is never a topos and its exactness
properties are rather bad, but it does recapture classical restrictions in
many cases. For example, within the Boolean algebra classifier
(=presheaves on the category of non-empty finite sets) this canonical
subcategory is the category of all classical simplicial complexes, a
"higher dimensional" version of your remark about undirected graphs.

    Let me take this opportunity to make another remark about undirected
graphs. They are treated on pages 176 - 180 in the book by Bob Rosebrugh
and me where in particular the two kinds of loops are clearly pointed out.
But I like Steve Schanuel's proposal of a way of picturing these objects:
there is a "geometric realization" functor from undirected graphs to
topological spaces which preserves all colimits ("gluing") (but not finite
limits), namely the Kan extension of the covariant inclusion of the monoid
into topological spaces which interprets the involution as  1-t on the
unit interval. Since the one-lane "loop" is the coequalizer of two maps
from I to I in the graph topos, the same coequalizer statement remains
true for the geometric realizations. Therefore, the resulting picture of
the one-lane loop is as a cul-de-sac, with one starting point, a
parameterization which goes until t=1/2, then returns to the starting
point, without encountering any other points. For example, the truth
value "foray" can be pictured this way. This flattened loop picture
not only has the foregoing rigorous justification but should make
visualizing the objects less nerve-wracking. Of course, the two-lane loops
are now pictured simply as loops, parameterized in two canonical ways
by the unit interval.

The Lawvere category of extended positive real numbers has also an
autonomous structure, with a multiplicative tensor product (instead
of the original additive one). Has this been considered somewhere?

To be more explicit:

The well-known article of Lawvere on "Metric spaces..." (Rend. Milano
1974, republished in TAC Reprints n. 1) introduced the category of
extended positive real numbers, from  0 to oo (infinity included),
with arrows  x \geq y,  equipped with a strict symmetric monoidal
closed structure:  the tensor product is the sum, the internal hom is
truncated difference (with oo - oo = 0).

Now, the same category can be equipped with a multiplicative tensor
product,  x.y.
Provided we define  0.oo = oo  (so that tensoring by any element
preserves the initial object oo), this is again a strict symmetric
monoidal closed structure, with  hom(y, z) = z/y.  Now, the
'undetermined forms'  0/0  and  oo/oo  are defined to be 0.
The new multiplicative structure is even *-autonomous, with
involution  x* = 1/x  (and 'nearly' compact).

(Note that this choice of values of the undetermined forms comes from
privileging the direction  x \geq y,  which is necessary if we want
to view metric spaces, normed categories etc. as enriched categories).

One advantage of symmetric simplicial sets is that their model
category structure is determined, cf. (*), by taking cofibrations
as monomorphisms. It means that the classical homotopy category
Ho (of CW-complexes) can be obtained just from the category S
of symmetric simplicial sets (without any additional data).
Simplicial sets do not have this property (it was also observed
by J. H. Smith). In (*), we have used this property of S to give
an elementary proof of an important result of D. Dugger saying
that Ho is a free homotopy theory over a point.

    and universal homotopy theories, TAMS 355 (2003), 3611-3623.

Hi,

I just came across the following pages

http://motls.blogspot.com/2004/11/category-theory-and-physics.html
http://motls.blogspot.com/2004/11/this-week-208-analysis.html

written by Lubos Motl, a physicist (string theorist). Some of you may find
these articles interesting and probably revealing.

Are we category theorists as a whole going to quietly accept getting
discredited by a minority of us presumably applying category theory to
string theory? It is surely not too late to react and point out that this is
not what (all of) category theory is about. Please give a thought about what
we, as a community, can urgently do to repair this damaging impression.
Unless we are prepared to wait until things change by themselves within our
lifetime.


Hopefully disturbing your weekend,
Cordially,

This might be an embarrassingly easy question, but I always get confused about
it. When are all monos in an algebraic category regular (or more generally,
when are all monos in a regular category regular)? What are some sensible
sufficient or necessary conditions?

For example, all monos in the category of groups are regular. How about the
category of lattices, or lattices with a top element?

Dear Marta,

My reaction to the blog posts you cite is that this is a sting theorist
holding
his breath and refusing to learn category theory. My guess is that Motl
wouldn't
want to learn the heavily categorical formulations of mirror symmetry
that Yan
Soibelman uses, even though they are motivated by string theory.
Basically
categorical ideas aren't part of the standard bag of tricks physicists
use (even
though they often give much more elegant, concise, and insightful
formulations of some of those tricks), and the proverb about 'old dogs'
and
'new tricks' applies to physicists as well.

His attack on Baez is fairly standard stuff:  in the mode of "string
theory
is the theory of nature, so we don't want to think about alternatives
like
loop quantum gravity."  It is a polemical defense of a scientific
theory that
hasn't produced a testable prediction in the 40 plus years since its
inception,
and worse than that, unless one adds bells and whistles to fix it (in
the manner
of 'gaseous Vulcan' or Ptolemaic epicycles), predicts the existence
of a massless scalar field *not observed in nature*.  It really has
nothing at
all to say about category theory, which is after all a mathematical
theory
which stands irrespective of its extra-mathematical applications.

Categorical ideas are absolutely central to several competitors to
string theory:
the Barrett-Crane model of quantum gravity (and to a lesser
extent 'loop quantum gravity' with which the BC model is often
conflated)
and Connes' recovery of the Standard Model from non-commutative geometry
(a part of mathematics which has obliged reluctant mathematicians to
think about
categorical ideas deeper than they originally were comfortable with).
There is nothing
cracked or crackpot about either.

It is simply a fact we have to live with that our subject has found
legitimate uses
in physics, but uses which are unpopular with the dominant school of
physics in
the North America.  If (I suspect when) the string theory emperor turns
out
to have no clothes, category theory will suddenly become de rigeur in
physics.  (As it should, since categorical expressions of physical
ideas are the logical conclusion of 20th century physics drive to
express
everything in coordinate-free terms.)

Best Thoughts,
David Yetter

To say that monos are regular (in a variety or, more generally, in a general
category satisfying some very minor hypotheses) amounts to the so-called
Intersection Property of Amalgamations: for any two algebras A, B with a common
subalgebra C, if there are monomorphisms f : A --> D, g: B --> D that coincide
on C, then one can choose f, g with the additional property that C is their
pullback. References:

C.M. Ringel: JPAA 2 (1972) 341-42
W. Tholen: Algebra Univ. 14 (1982) 391-397
E.W. Kiss, L. Marki, P. Prohle, W. Tholen: Studia Sci. Math. Hungaricum 18
(1983) 79-141.

The last paper contains a large table of specific categories, including
lattices (the affirmative answer is attributed to Gratzer in this case), plus
an extensive list to the literature. For some categories, the question whether
monos are regular can get quite involved, for example in the category of
compact (Hausdorff) groups, for which an affirmative answer was provided by
Poguntke (Math. Z. 130 (1973) 107-117).

The property in question obviously implies "epimorphisms are surjective", but
examples witnessing failure of the converse statement are harder to find: see
again the four-author paper.

Hope this helps.

Walter Tholen.

I congratulate Marta for her posting, I just read Motls's

http://motls.blogspot.com/2004/11/category-theory-and-physics.html

and find it very revealing as Marta said, and more than that, I find it a
very clear exposition (by way of philosophy and by way of examples)
about what is good science and mathematicas and about what it is not.

Marta is right about that it concerns all of us category theoricist.

I will like to see here a debate about Motls's writing quoted above.

Just about this writing, NOT ABOUT Motls himself or other things he may
have done or represent !!

I do not feel capable to say something because in particular am ignorant
of physics, but many of you are not. I think in Bill for example.

So long    Eduardo Dubuc

	I don't see that we have any more need to do this than (for instance)
algebraic topologist, group theorists, or differential geometers have
when somebody floats a perhaps-too-conjectural theory using those
branches of mathematics. Heck, physicists have managed to come up with
what are now generally seen as dubious theories using nothing more than
elementary arithmetic (Dirac's Big Numbers hypothesis, say.)  Do the
number theorists have to protest this?

	Big problems in physics have tended to be solved only after a lot of
attempts that look pretty strange in retrospect (think of some of the
early models of the atom!)   But correct theories (or at least theories
that represent a major improvement in understanding and prediction) can
also look pretty strange;  think how general relativity, or even special
relativity, must have looked in their day.  I seem to recall that the
periodic table was originally considered at least as dubious as Bode's
Law - and if they had been able to measure molecular masses more
accurately in Mendeleev's day, they would have seen that the main idea
was actually _wrong_, and its acceptance would probably have had to
await the technology to separate individual isotopes, which do have
(reasonably) predictable masses.  Quaternions were fashionable in
Victorian days to represent motions in space, dropped out of fashion
when people decided that the restriction of their applicability to
three-dimensional space was parochial, and dropped back in again when
people realized that in fact a three-plus-one-dimensional spacetime had
some rather special properties.

	Mathematics, like the phone service, is a "common carrier". We develop
it; we use it; but we have neither the right nor the obligation to
police how others apply it (unless they get the mathematics itself
wrong?).  Moreover, given the historical difficulty of recognizing good
physical theories ahead of time, it would be impossible to do so wisely
even if we had the right.

	I do not see how anybody can possibly discredit category theory by
applying it to string theory, even inappropriately, any more than "The
da Vinci Code" discredits classical geometry and number theory.

Dear Robert,

I agree with most of what you say, and I was not suggesting that we police
how categorists choose to apply their field. Nothing further from my mind.

But organizers of meetings in category-related subjects can certainly direct
attention to certain trends in category theory, thereby promoting certain
areas over others, and this they can easily do by their choice of invited
speakers of (series of) lectures. They may have neither the right nor the
obligation to do so, but they certainly have the power to do so. If this
happens consistently, then the outcome is predictable. Students (and their
advisors) might flock to certain areas of research just because they are
fashionable and can thus get funding that otherwise will not be easily
obtained. This may lead to narrow developments of any subject that they
approach with this objective in mind, and that is dangerous for the future
of category theory (of mathematics, in general). That is my main concern. My
posting tried to call attention to what I think is a sad state of affairs in
category theory, when it need not be.

Best wishes,
Marta

	It is not clear to me that the majority of theoretical physicists agree
with the negative view of categorical string theory held by the cited
blog writers; and in the absence of a consensus among the physicists, I
for one (with an undergradate degree and some graduate courses in
physics) do not feel qualified to take sides; if anything, errors should
be on the side of trying out too many ideas, not too few.

	I have this image of differential geometers saying to each other, a
century ago, "Don't you think somebody ought to tell that Einstein to
stop trying to use differential geometry to explain gravity, before our
whole field gets a bad name?"

	Of course, the pioneering knot theorists probably thought that Lord
Kelvin ought to stop trying to explain atomic nuclei as knotted loops of
ether, too.  But I think Einstein did differential geometry more good
than Kelvin did harm to knot theory.  A mathematical technique  powerful
enough to show that a physical theory does *not* work has shown its own
value.

	What has sometimes gone on, at least for a while, is that very abstract
physical theories have continued to be studied after it had become
obvious that their predictions were wildly at variance with observation,
or that they would never make any predictions. Even then I don't think
the reputation of the mathematical theory being abused suffers, though
that of the neighboring theoretical physicists may. I don't think this
is the case with string theory yet, though I could be wrong.

	Cheers,
	      Robert Dawson

I was trying to elicit an open response from those who *do* know about the
value (or lack of it) of categorical string theory. In particular, I would
like to have an answer to this question. Why is it that anything which even
remotedly claims to have applications to physics (particularly string
theory) is
given (what I view as) uncritical support in our circles?

I can't tell if you're kidding.  I'll assume you're not.

There's nothing wrong with applying category theory to string theory.
The papers by Michael Douglas and Paul Aspinwall cited above by Motl
are some nice examples of using derived categories to study D-branes.

Further examples: the Moore-Seiberg relations turn out to be little
more than the definition of a balanced monoidal category, and the
Segal-Moore axioms for open-closed topological strings are nicely
captured using category theory here:

http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0510664

There were a lot of nice talks on the borderline between category
theory and string theory at the Streetfest.

Perhaps more to the point, Lubos Motl is famous for his heated
rhetoric.  He doesn't like me, or anyone else who criticizes
string theory.  The articles you mention above are mainly reactions
to my This Week's Finds.

He's actually being very gentle - for him.  He even says "the
role of category theory can therefore be described as a `progressive
direction' within string theory".

I'm sure you'll all be pleased to know that.  :-)

> It is surely not too late to react and point out that this is
> not what (all of) category theory is about.

I would urge everyone not to react - at least, not until they are
well aware of what a discussion with him is like.  See his blog
and his comments on Peter Woit's blog if you don't understand what
I mean.   For example:

http://pitofbabel.org/blog/?p=51

> Please give a thought about what
> we, as a community, can urgently do to repair this damaging impression.

Since Motl's personality is well known, any damage will be minimal.
I think we should relax and take it easy.

Best,
jb

The situation is more complicated in that what could be classed as
speculation may get published as theorem and proof. For example,  in
algebraic topology, sometimes proofs of continuity are omitted as if this
was an exercise for the reader, yet the formulation of why the maps are
continuous (if they are necessarily so) may contain a key aspect of what
should be a complete proof. This difficulty was pointed out to me years ago
by Eldon Dyer in relation to results on local fibration implies global
fibration (for paracompact spaces) where he and Eilenberg felt Dold's paper
on this
contained the first complete proof. I have been unable to complete the proof
in Spanier's book, even the second edition. (I sent a correction to Spanier
as the key function in the first edition was not well defined, after
Spanier had replied `Isn't it continuous?')   Eldon speculated (!) that
perhaps 50% of published algebraic topology was seriously wrong!

van Kampen's original 1935 `proof' of what is called his theorem is
incomprehensible today, and maybe was then also.

Efforts to give full details of a major result, i.e. to give a proof, are
sometimes derided. Of course credit should be given to the originator of the
major steps towards a proof.

Grothendieck's efforts to develop structures and language which would reduce
proofs to a sequence of tautologies are notable here. Colin McLarty's
excellent article on `The rising sea: Grothendieck on simplicity and
generality ' is relevant.

Some scientists snear at the mathematical notion of rigour and of proof. On
the other hand many are attracted to math because it can give explanations
of why something is true. But `explanations' need a higher level of
structural language than for what might be called proofs.

I can't resist mentioning that one student questionaire on my first year
analysis wrote `Professor Brown puts in too many proofs.' So I determined to
rectify the situation, and next year there were no theorems,  and no proofs.
However there were lots of statements labelled `FACT' followed by several
paragraphs labelled `EXPLANATION'.  This did modify the course because
something labelled `explanation' ought really to explain something! I leave
you all to puzzle this out!

In homotopy theory, many matters, such as the homotopy addition lemma, had
clear proofs only years after they were well used.

Surely much early algebraic topology is speculative, in that the language
has not yet been developed to express concepts with rigour so that a clear
proof can be written down. It would be  a curious ahistorical assumption
that there is not at this date another future level of concepts which
require a similar speculative approach to reach towards them.

The blog in question is indeed more than dubious. Besides the
"scientific" manicheism (group good, monoid bad...), what to think
about ranking countries according to a "civilization index"? The
blogger also claims he was mastering differential geometry and
particle physics at age of 15, so he obviously was too busy and
missed the provocative phase. Not a reason however to try to catch it
up as an "adult".

Dear Marco,

This has been considered by Brian Day. He spoke about it in a talk
                *-autonomous convolution=20
in the Australian Category Seminar on 5 March 1999,

You can also transform this via the log/exponential functions to an=20
additive tensor product on the extended (positive and negative) reals.

Regards,

Steve Lack.

=20
The Lawvere category of extended positive real numbers has also an
autonomous structure, with a multiplicative tensor product (instead
of the original additive one). Has this been considered somewhere?

To be more explicit:

The well-known article of Lawvere on "Metric spaces..." (Rend. Milano
1974, republished in TAC Reprints n. 1) introduced the category of
extended positive real numbers, from  0 to oo (infinity included),
with arrows  x \geq y,  equipped with a strict symmetric monoidal
closed structure:  the tensor product is the sum, the internal hom is
truncated difference (with oo - oo =3D 0).

Now, the same category can be equipped with a multiplicative tensor
product,  x.y.
Provided we define  0.oo =3D oo  (so that tensoring by any element
preserves the initial object oo), this is again a strict symmetric
monoidal closed structure, with  hom(y, z) =3D z/y.  Now, the
'undetermined forms'  0/0  and  oo/oo  are defined to be 0.
The new multiplicative structure is even *-autonomous, with
involution  x* =3D 1/x  (and 'nearly' compact).

(Note that this choice of values of the undetermined forms comes from
privileging the direction  x \geq y,  which is necessary if we want
to view metric spaces, normed categories etc. as enriched categories).

I just posted a notice of a special session on Categorical Logic and
Quantum Computation in the upcoming ASL meeting at UQAM - although the
preparation for that session goes back many months, and it was always
my intention to post a schedule for the session here, I was reminded
to do so upon reading Marta's message; in a sense I see it as a
partial reply (even if the applications to physics are not those of
the postings Marta quoted).  I think the mathematics of that session
will be of a high standard - we hope many of you will attend to judge
for yourselves!

Roger Penrose, page 960 of "The Road to Reality - A Complete Guide to the
Laws of the Universe":

  Another idea that may someday find a significant role to play in
  physical theory is *category* theory and its generalisation to
  n-category theory.  [...]  It would not altogether surprise me to find
  these notions playing some significant role in superseding conventional
  spacetime notions in the physics of the 21st century.

I also would like to support the remarks of Marta with which I am in
full agreement.
The category theory community seems happy to accept uncritically, and
give centre-stage to, any interest shown by an external field. In this
context one should certainly look the gift horse in the mouth.

My guess is that most of the algebraic topologists assume that the map=20
they are constructing is automatically continuous since the proof will work=
=20
for example for simplicial sets (in which there is no continuity to check).=
=20
And this argument is wrong : because the category of general topological=20
spaces is not cartesian closed while the category of simplicial sets is=20
cartesian closed. And most of these proofs of continuity become possible on=
ly=20
by working in a more convenient category of topological spaces.

Hi,

I am relieved to learn (from the postings by David Yetter and John Baez)
that Motl's blog on the issue of categories and string theory is based on 1)
(Yetter) Motl's reluctance, as is the case with many string theorists, to
refuse to learn category theory, and 2) (Baez) Motl's personal dislike of
John Baez and of many other people, so that since Motl's personality is
well-known, any damage will be minimal.

I have also been reminded that 1) (Yetter) categorical ideas are central to
several competitors of string theory, and that there is nothing cracked or
crackpotish about them, and 2) (Baez) there is some serious work in the
borderline of category theory and string theory as exemplified by several
speakers at the StreetFest.

I thank David and John for taking the trouble to respond in detail to what
may have seem as a "provocation" on my part (well, perhaps it was...).

But these informative responses do not address my main concern, which is one
that others (publicly, as Eduardo Dubuc, but several others privately) have
expressed to me following my posting. I was aiming at the fact that there is
a certain trend within category theory (when did it start?) to consistely
give center stage to anything that claims to have connections with physics
(in particular string theory).  Is this because (it is believed that) the
state of category theory is now so poor (as "evidenced" by the lack of
grants) that they (the organizers of meetings) want to repair this image at
any cost? Also, by so doing, are we not becomeing vulnerable?  Are we not
pushing students to work on a certain area on the grounds that it is
fashionable and likely to be funded, even if those students may lack the
motivation and sound background knowledge? I feel that this is dangerous for
category theory (and mathematics in general), as it may lead (is leading?)
to narrow developments of any subject that is approached with these
objectives in mind. I did point these concerns of mine already, in response
to the posting by Robert MacDawson, whom I also thank for giving me the
opportunity to make clearer what my real concerns are.

On the subject of what constitutes good mathematics, Ronnie Brown has
pointed out to me a beautiful expose (with Tim Porter) which you can find in
www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/publar.html
I urge you to read it.

I end with a quote from the end of David Yetter's posting in reply to mine.
"If (I suspect when) the string theory emperor turns out to have no clothes,
category theory will suddenly become de rigeur in physics".  I share his
optimism.


Most cordially,
Marta Bunge

                    MGS Workshop 2006
*************************************************************

                  2nd Call for Participation

The Midlands Graduate School is taking place

     8 - 12 April 2006 at the University of Leicester, UK.

A timetable is now available at our updated website

               http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/~mgs2006

The School finishes on Wednesday at lunch time. Afterwards a small
workshop will be held to give PhD students the opportunity to present
their own work. If you are interested send a title and abstract to
mgs2006 at mcs.le.ac.uk.

The School provides an intensive course of lectures on the Foundations
of Computing. It is very well established, having run annually for the
past six years, and has always proved a popular and successful event.
This year we have Luke Ong, Oxford University and Thomas Streicher,
Darmstadt University as guest lecturers.

The lectures are aimed at graduate students, typically in their first
or second year of study for a PhD. However, the school is open to
anyone who is interested in learning more about mathematical computing
foundations, and we especially invite participants from UK
universities and from sites participating in the APPSEM working group.

Foundational courses:

R Crole         Leicester       Operational Semantics
P Levy          Birmingham      Typed Lambda Calculus
D Pattinson     Leicester       Category Theory

Advanced courses:

T Altenkirch    Nottingham      Quantum Programming
M Escardo       Birmingham      Operational Domain Theory & Topology
H Nilsson       Nottingham      Advanced Functional Programming
L Ong           Oxford          Game Semantics
T Streicher     Darmstadt       Constructive Logic
E Tuosto        Leicester       Concurrency and Mobility


We still have a small number grants for students resident in the UK,
while APPSEM funds can be used to support students from APPSEM
affiliated sites.

Abstract.

The well-known Lawvere category  R  of extended real positive numbers
comes with a monoidal closed structure where the tensor product is
the sum. But  R  has another such structure, given by multiplication,
which is *-autonomous and a CL-algebra (linked with classical linear
logic).

	Normed sets, with a norm in  R,  inherit thus two symmetric monoidal
closed structures, and categories enriched on one of them have a
'subadditive' or 'submultiplicative' norm, respectively. Typically,
the first case occurs when the norm expresses a cost, the second with
Lipschitz norms.

	This paper is a preparation for a sequel, devoted to 'weighted
algebraic topology', an enrichment of directed algebraic topology.
The structure of  R,  and its extension to the complex projective
line, might be a first step in abstracting a notion of algebra of
weights, linked with physical measures.

This is a retitled, revised, refined, expanded edition of my topology book
previously published in 1968 and 1988, and now available at the amazing
price of $23.99.
To order, please use the following link:

http://www.booksurge.com/product.php3?bookID=GPUB05314-00001&affiliateID=A001356

Their Global Publishing System should allow more local printing and
delivery.

538 pages. List of chapters:
Some topology on the real line
Topological spaces
Connected spaces, compact spaces
Identification spaces and cell complexes
Projective and other spaces
The fundamental groupoid
Some combinatorial groupoid theory
Cofibrations
Computation of the fundamental groupoid
Covering spaces, covering groupoids
Orbit spaces, orbit groupoids
Conclusion

It combines a geometric and a categorical approach, where the latter allows
clear analogies between areas of mathematics, such as topology and algebra.
This is seen very clearly in the chapters on covering spaces and orbit
spaces.

Here are some examples of topics covered not available in other texts at
this level:
the initial topology on joins of spaces;
the convenient category of k-spaces in the non Hausdorff case;
a gluing theorem for homotopy equivalences;
the Phragmen-Brouwer property, proved using the groupoid van Kampen theorem,
and applied to the Jordan Curve theorem;
the equivalence between covering maps of spaces and covering morphisms of
groupoids;
the fundamental groupoid of an orbit space by a discontinuous action of a
group as the orbit groupoid of the fundamental groupoid.

The book is graced by a cover by John Robinson and Ben Dickens.

Hi:

I will put quotations from different postings or Molt's writing in between
two "**"

Well, I can see the classical reaction of some groups when one of its
members points out that something is really wrong with the group.

Marta will suffer all kind of "polite" (nothing of the sort of the
Benabou-Taylor confrontation) attacks, but not for this less devious or
sanguine. Typically she will be taken out of context, or get answers to
questions she never had asked, or be treated ironically or in disbelief
(**I can't tell if you're kidding.  I'll assume you're not **)


There are two principal points here:

1. The real value of some contributions of category theory to physics.

2.  The lot of rubbish written using category theory and which is
fashionable because it claims to have applications to physics.


Marta was forced to explicit some of the questions we can clearly see in
between lines in her original posting:

** I was trying to elicit an open response from those who *do* know about
the value (or lack of it) of categorical string theory. In particular, I
would like to have an answer to this question. Why is it that anything
which even remotely claims to have applications to physics (particularly
string theory) is given (what I view as) uncritical support in our
circles?

Best,
Marta **

I will like to see a clear answer to this question. Or a clear refutation
proving that it is not the case.

Notice that the existence of point 2. above is perfectly consistent with
the existence of really valuable contributions of category theory to
string theory, which is one of the points treated by Motl.

** There's nothing wrong with applying category theory to string theory.
The papers by Michael Douglas and Paul Aspinwall cited above by Motl
are some nice examples of using derived categories to study D-branes.**

This make us think that they may be some valuable contributions, but this
possibility is also left open by Motl himself.

Quoting myself:

** I will like to see here a debate about Motls's writing quoted above.

Just about this writing, NOT ABOUT Motls himself or other things he may
have done or represent !! **

No luck, just discredit Motl, not refute his sayings:

**  Perhaps more to the point, Lubos Motl is famous for his heated
rhetoric.  He doesn't like me, or anyone else who criticizes
string theory.  The articles you mention above are mainly reactions
to my This Week's Finds. **

** My reaction to the blog posts you cite is that this is a sting theorist
holding his breath and refusing to learn category theory. My guess is that
Motl wouldn't want to learn the heavily categorical formulations of mirror
symmetry that Yan Soibelman uses, even though they are motivated by string
theory.**

The following is  better in answering Motl:

** Categorical ideas are absolutely central to several competitors to
string theory: the Barrett-Crane model of quantum gravity (and to a lesser
extent 'loop quantum gravity' with which the BC model is often
conflated) and Connes' recovery of the Standard Model from non-commutative
geometry (a part of mathematics which has obliged reluctant mathematicians
to think about categorical ideas deeper than they originally were
comfortable with). There is nothing cracked or crackpot about either. **

I am unable to judge, but it seems to me this gives category theory strong
support But does not go against what Motl says concerning category
theory. Neither against Marta's warning that category theory is being
discredited by many (she says a minority) category theory people.

Motl writes:

** I've asked the same elementary questions to many people who've been
trying to explain me derived categories - some of them with some success,
most of them with no success whatsoever: Are these notions and statements
of category theory something that you can prove - or at least check in
many situations - to be valid for string theory as we know it, or is it
just an unproven conjecture that derived categories describe D-branes? **

Can somebody give a an answer ?

He also writes:

** I always feel very uneasy if the mathematically oriented people present
their conjectures about physics, quantum gravity, or string theory as some
sort of "obvious facts". **

I would say that any serious scientist or mathematician would feel the
same way !!, and also that this seems to be a common practice in many
papers that claim applications of category theory to physics.

** I have this image of differential geometers saying to each other, a
century ago, "Don't you think somebody ought to tell that Einstein to
stop trying to use differential geometry to explain gravity, before our
whole field gets a bad name?" **

Well, Einstein was not "trying to", he was using it, and presented this
use as an accomplished fact.

Also, you forgot to mention that he flunk a high-school exam or something
of the sort proving by this very fact that a lot of people were stupid,
just as they are those which have doubts about the real value of some
applications of category theory to physics !

** I do not see how anybody can possibly discredit category theory by
applying it to string theory, even inappropriately, any more than "The
da Vinci Code" discredits classical geometry and number theory. **

** Since Motl's personality is well known, any damage will be minimal.
I think we should relax and take it easy.**

Well, rubbish category theory always discredits the whole of category
theory, specially given the fact that it is not yet a prestigious and
established subject (think in SGA4 and the introduction of SGA41/2)

It will be nice to relax and take it easy.

Will all of us do so  ?

I hope we will read in this cat-list some valuable considerations about
Motl's questions and doubts, and about Marta's courageous warnings.

e.d.

Mostly well said, David
I would only modify/deform ;-) what you say
by doubting therte are that many physicists
who are anti-cat theory (not pro-)
but watch out
once some leader of the school adopts it
the school will follow - much faster than if they were mathematicians

It's not so much the applications that seduce some of us
but rather the *new* structures the physicists suggest that turn
out to have neat mathemaical, e.g. categorical, aspects.
e.g quantum groups

Consider instead what happened in algebraic topology in the last century
(or in  invariant theory of polynomial forms in the previous one):
classic internal problems e.g. homotopy groups of spheres ground on and
on while the enthusiasm and excitement of `application' motivated
problems died with a lack of such problems (I have in mind vector fields
on spheres and allsorts of diff geom motivations).

Exactly - if it's good math, it's not tainted by being invented by
physicists.

With respect to the gruppenpest (and perhaps the actual situation
concerning groupoids and categories), here is a quote from John
Slater, who was the head of the MIT Physics departement and a leading
American physicist:


"It was at this point that Wigner, Hund, Heitler, and Weyl entered the
picture with their "Gruppenpest": the pest of the group theory.... The
authors of the "Gruppenpest" wrote papers which were incomprehensible
to those like me who had not studied group theory, in which they
applied these theoretical results to the study of the many electron
problem. The practical consequences appreared to be negligible, but
everyone felt that to be in the mainstream one had to learn about it.
Yet there were no good texts from which one could learn group theory.
It was a frustrating experience, worthy of the name of a pest.

I had what I can only describe as a feeling of outrage at the turn
which the subject had taken...

As soon as this (Slater's) paper became known, it was obvious that a
great many other physicists were as disgusted as I had been with the
group-theoretical approach to the problem. As I heard later, there
were remarks made such as "Slater has slain the '"Gruppenpest"'. I
believe that no other piece of work I have done was so universally
popular".

I take this quote from Sternberg's book "Group Theory and Physics" who has
taken it from Slater's autobiography.

Maybe it has something to do with MIT ; -).

Best,

Jean-Pierre Marquis

i think this is a very nice metaphor. but i am not sure that being
critical about science is as easy as looking in horses mouth. already
hilbert was largely wrong when he tried to prescribe a shape of a
science. and nowadays it is a much harder task. everyone sees just a
very small fragment. research advances by evolution, not by
intelligent design.

the division between pure and applied mathematics is not as simple as
it used to be. 20 years ago, if you wanted to work on something that
would never ever degrade into applications, then algebraic geometry
probably seemed like a good bet. nowadays, at each moment, millions
of transactions on the internet are secured using elliptic and
hyperelliptic curves; the structure of their picard groups is
discussed in standardisation bodies. if a bank protects its customers
from phishing by identity-based keys, they are using weil or tate
pairing...

so the purest math has become the most applied; the most spiritual
the most concrete. the other way around, these applications put a
babylonian library on everyone's desk. what was picard group again?
google for it. biology research is based on large public databases.
physics is documented (driven?) by blogs. even category theory is
discussed online.

so i think it is great that people get nasty, or personal about
category theory. the landscape of babylon: "the dog barks while the
caravan goes by."

just my 2p,

Due to an editing error on my part some of you will have received four
posts from Jim Stasheff with no subject line, and in some cases (as Nimish
Shah pointed out to Jim, who also alerted me) spam filters will have
prevented delivery. With apologies to Jim, these messages are repeated
below (except for some of the material repeated from earlier posts).

Since I will be away from email access there will be an interruption in
postings to this list until Wednesday starting a little more than 24 hours
from now. Several new items in the current thread will be posted shortly,
and responses to them arriving in the next day will be posted, but I would
encourage you not to submit further items for posting until after
Wednesday.

It's not so much the applications that seduce some of us
but rather the *new* structures the physicists suggest that turn
out to have neat mathemaical, e.g. categorical, aspects.
e.g quantum groups

Consider instead what happened in algebraic topology in the last century
(or in  invariant theory of polynomial forms in the previous one):
classic internal problems e.g. homotopy groups of spheres ground on and
on while the enthusiasm and excitement of `application' motivated
problems died with a lack of such problems (I have in mind vector fields
on spheres and allsorts of diff geom motivations).

Exactly - if it's good math, it's not tainted by being invented by
physicists.

Dear Marta,
My english is so, so. I am french.
But this is to give briefly my opinion (I agree with you
more or less).

I know a little of category and mathematics in general.
I love the category theory developped in the 70's and
I would have appreciated some category meetings at the
time.  But i am too young.

Category theory like any good mathematics will never
die - but may "our" category community will.

Of course the problem is the way research is sponsored.
Leading researchers are not so much good mathematicians
but good salesmen. Category theory is just not very trendy at the
minute and to get the money one needs to do theoretical physics
(there had been also Computer Science at some point - that was poor
is not it?).
There were a couple of Fields medals and  a new train called
TQFT that everybody just jumps in to get funded.

Now as a *community* what shall *we* do?

First the question regards mainly the established
people in the community (not me!).
1/ One can try to sell category theory  in a better way.
This is a bit like tomato sauce that you can put everywhere.
And try to make new friends - inviting them to give talks... -
from different disciplines.
2/ We may claim loudly that cat theory is real mathematics
and really try hard to do good mathematics. There are
certainly good mathematicians definitely willing to use
cat theory.  I saw many coming to category theory to develop
their own maths (- this happens for instance in France with Berger who
will never claim that he is a "categorician". Though he is completely
in it!)

My feeling is the attitude 1/ pushed to the extreme may be
very damaging.  These talks about category everywhere and
for everything are just poor and sound really stupid.
They do not serve the cause.

2/ Will be the rebirth of category - I bet!

Sorry for the message written in haste
and the poor english. Good e-mails from you
on the list!

best regards,
Vincent.

	He didn't just wake up one morning with the whole thing in finished
form.  Moreover, it was some time before it was experimentally verified;
some details, such as the presence or absence of a cosmological
constant, took some time to settle; some predictions (black holes,  Big
Bang) were not generally accepted for some time;  and even now it is
known *not* to be a good description of the universe at a very small scale.

	I did not "forget" to, it never occurred to me to do so, for two good
reasons.

  	Firstly, I don't see the relevance.  Are you suggesting that

(1) Einstein must have been stupid to flunk an exam, or that

(2) his teacher and N-1 unspecified others were stupid because

	(2a) an exam was set that Einstein could flunk, or
	(2b) Einstein having flunked the exam, they did not recognize his
future genius & change the grade?

	None of these conclusions seem justified to me... as my records   at
Dalhousie and Cambridge will show,   people can flunk exams on bad days;
I don't *think* I'm stupid, and I know the instructors who set the exams
were not.

    But, secondly and more to the point, recent research suggests that
the story of Einstein's failing grades is apocryphal. What seems to have
happened is that  his school changed over from a grading scheme with 1
high and 6 low to one with 6 high and 1 low, and a surviving report card
had been misinterpreted.  See for instance:

	http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1115185.htm

I wonder what Eduardo Dubuc means by "the Benabou-Taylor confrontation".
Could he possibly be referring to the Christmas flame-war to which Eduardo
was himself a major contributor, but which I attempted to settle with him
privately and amicably?

I suggest that he and Marta Bunga should go for a long walk to calm down.

I'm not pointing any fingers at Eduardo or Marta, but those who were active
in category theory in the 1960s and 70s would be well advised to think twice
before accusing those who came later of bringing category theory into disrepute.

I wonder when the phrases "generalised abstract nonsense" and "empty set
theory" came into circulation?   I seem to remember hearing them when I was
an undergraduate.

I wonder which generation it was that got prestigeous jobs in mathematics
departments at a time when (at least in Britain) they were being given away
in corn flakes packets?   Which generation is it that struggles to get jobs
in computer science departments?  Which subject was it, according to the
participants of a parallel conference in Vancouver in 2004, whose followers
were "easily recognisable because they're all so old"?

Which generation was it that alienated other mathematicians by making
outrageous claims about the foundations of mathematics that it never
backed up with theorems?   Which generation actually got its hands dirty
and proved the theorems that relate category theory to other foundational
disciplines?

I have no idea what John Baez's standing is amongst physicists. Therefore
Marta is quite correct in warning me that it would be foolish for me to
base public claims of the value of category theory on its applications
to physics.   John is nevertheless very welcome in our community, in my
humble opinion, BECAUSE he brings in new ideas from physics, BECAUSE
he exports some of our ideas in return, and because he is good at
presenting ideas of either kind.

Also, I don't need to be specific about them to say that the applications
to physics, computation, topology, geometry, analysis, ... are the reasons
why I consider that category theory is a Good Thing.   In my experience,
category theory as a tool usually points me in the right direction, whereas
set theory usually points me in the wrong one.  (To give credit where
it is due, Jamie Gabbay's work on alpha-equivalence is a counterexample.)

Category theory has been successful on many many occasions - starting in
algebraic topology - in removing the clutter of ad hoc definitions that
have no conceptual anchor.   For example, I was once told that "a matrix
is an array of numbers".   I am currently looking into Interval Analysis,
in which all of the textbooks begin with a chapter of miscellaneous notation
based on defining an interval as a pair [a,b] or as the subset of classical
real numbers that lie between them - "analysis with double vision", as
I call it.   (To give credit again where it is due, the "Interval Newton"
algorithm is a genuine insight into solving equations - it does not just
do what you might imagine it does.)

So I urge Marta, Eduardo and everybody else to stop trying to "police"
category theory, and instead celebrate its achievements in many areas of
mathematics.

[Category theory is used heavily in the semantics of programming
languages, and it used in interesting ways in the semantics of quantum
programming languages. Therefore, this announcement might be of
interest to the categories community. -PS]

			   CALL FOR PAPERS

     4th International Workshop on Quantum Programming Languages
			      (QPL2006)

		       July 17-19, 2006, Oxford

	    http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/qpl2006/

				* * *

  The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working
  on mathematical foundations and programming languages for quantum
  computing. In the last few years, there has been a growing interest
  in logical tools, languages, and semantical methods for analyzing
  quantum computation. These foundational approaches complement the
  more mainstream research in quantum computation which emphasizes
  algorithms and complexity theory.

  Possible topics include the design and semantics of quantum
  programming languages, new paradigms for quantum programming,
  specification of quantum algorithms, higher-order quantum
  computation, quantum data types, reversible computation, axiomatic
  approaches to quantum computation, abstract models for quantum
  computation, properties of quantum computing resources and
  primitives, concurrent and distributed quantum computation,
  compilation of quantum programs, semantical methods in quantum
  information theory, and categorical models for quantum computation.

  Previous workshops in this series were held in Ottawa (2003), Turku
  (2004), and Chicago (2005).

  This year's workshop will be held in Oxford, as part of the
  week-long event "Cats, Kets and Cloisters", July 17-23, 2006,
  which will include four workshops on related topics (See
  http://se10.comlab.ox.ac.uk:8080/FOCS/CKCinOXFORD_en.html).

TUTORIALS:

  The first day of the workshop, July 17, will consist of tutorials,
  followed by two days of contributed research talks.

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE:

  Prospective speakers should submit a detailed abstract (or extended
  abstract) of 5-12 pages.  Submissions of works in progress are
  encouraged, but must be more substantial than a research proposal.
  Submissions must provide sufficient detail to allow the program
  committee to assess the merits of the work. Submissions should be
  in Postscript or PDF format, and should be sent to
  selinger@mathstat.dal.ca by May 10 (please put "workshop
  submission" in the subject line). Receipt of all submissions will
  be acknowledged by return email.

IMPORTANT DATES/DEADLINES:

  Submissions:				May 10, 2006
  Notification of acceptance:		May 31, 2006
  Corrected papers:			June 14, 2006
  Workshop:				July 17-19, 2006

Well Robert,

1)

I just wanted to put in evidence the following fallacy that you are
pushing forward:

To attack the use of category theory (by some people) in string theory is
at the same level that it would have been to attack the use (by Einstein)
of differential geometry in general relativity.

General relativity was born with differential geometry; it has no meaning
without differential geometry. String theory was already there when a
category theory approach began.

It is not the same thing.

Putting everything in the same bag is a well-known strategy to confuse an
issue.

Also, to have a poor opinion of many papers on applications of category
theory to physics is one thing, to say that category theory has no future
in physics is a completely different one. Nobody (including Motl's writing
I am discussing (*)) has said the latter!!

Quoting now from David Yetter:

** If (I suspect when) the string theory emperor turns out to have no
clothes, Category theory will suddenly become de rigeur in physics". **

I start to believe that independently from what it finally happens with
string theory; it is possible, even with the emperor well dressed, that
category theory will with time become the rigeur in physics.

2)

I can only say that I am sorry about your reaction to this. It was just an
irony, and I thought this was evident.

e.d.

(*) Motl said (if I remember correctly) something of the sort that he
thinks that to reach some goals of string theory certain category theory
approach will not be helpful.

	Sorry, Eduardo! That's a little oversimplified.   See, for instance,
section 17.7 of Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler's "Gravitation", among other
references.

	 General relativity (though of course not in its modern form) goes back
to Einstein's formulation of the equivalence principle in 1907 (only two
years after special relativity), and the prediction of the gravitational
red shift. In 1911 Einstein also predicted the bending of light by
massive bodies; this too is intrinsically part of GR.

	But it was only in 1912 that he realized that Euclidean geometry awas
not compatible with this, and (encouraged by Grossmann and Levi-Civita)
started looking at differential geometry as a way to handle
non-Euclidean spacetime.  Einstein and Grossmann's 1913 attempt at a
general relativity theory was wrong; it did not transform correctly.
Some time after this,  Planck specifically warned him that the
differential geometry approach would not work and would not be believed
if it did.

	In  November 1915 Einstein submitted two papers.  The first of these
explained some observations such as the precession of the perihelion of
Mercury, but in other ways made wildly nonphysical predictions
(essentially ignoring many of the effects of mass -though  this
"linearized theory" does have some uses as an approximation) He
corrected this soon with a second paper in which he finally got it
right. Sort of.

	In 1917 Einstein introduced a cosmological constant into his field
equations to account for the "fact" that the universe wasn't expanding.
In the 1920's he took it out again when it turned out that the universe
*was* expanding.  Now astronomers think there ought to be one, but with
a value very different from what Einstein originally put forward.

	So GR got by without differential geometry for five years; and it was
another decade or so before it was a mature theory with enough of  the
bugs out to do what was expected of it.  And, as you know, there are
still scales, almost a century later,  on which its predictions are
unsatisfactory.

By the way, I should explain why I thought you might be kidding in
your original post.  I had never heard anyone before suggest that
category theory could be discredited by applications to string theory.
It completely surprised me.  I'm used to the opposite complaint:
that category theory is discredited by its *lack* of applications.
Of course, this always comes from people who 1) haven't taken the time
to learn of its applications, 2) don't know enough category theory to
appreciate its *intrinsic* interest.

But it's good to hear your real concern:

Since I began as a mathematical physicist and got interested in
n-categories for their applications to topological quantum field theory,
only later falling in love with category theory per se, I'm the wrong one
to answer this question.  I don't even know if it's true that applications
to physics are given center stage, much less when this started, or why.

I know a bit more about how people in differential geometry and
differential topology got excited about work with links to physics.
This trend probably started around the time of the Atiyah-Singer
index theorem, which uses characteristic classes to compute the
Euler characteristics of certain chain complexes built using
differential operators.  At the time this result was proved (1962-1965),
it seemed an audacious blend of analysis and topology.  That's
one reason it caught people's interest.

Another reason people liked the index theorem so much was that it
turned out to be related to "anomalies" in quantum field theory,
a phenomenon discovered by Adler, Bell and Jackiw around 1969.
These nasty "anomalies" are actually a very practical issue
in particle physics: they're related to the lifetime of the pion,
and you can rule out field theories that have certain kinds of anomalies.

I guess the relation between the index theorem and anomalies only
became clear in the late 70's.  I guess people were shocked and
excited when it turned out that such sophisticated topology had
practical applications to physics.  Most topologists didn't know
any quantum field theory, and most quantum field theorists didn't
know that much topology.  So, a kind of mutual fascination developed:
both sides began learning about each other.

People gave lots of proofs of the index theorem that illustrated
very different ways of looking at it.  The first proof had used a lot
of K-theory and cobordism theory; later proofs used more facts about
the heat equation, but by the time I was in grad school (1982-86)
Quillen was giving lectures in which he tried to find a proof that
only used multivariable calculus and "super" reasoning - i.e., lots
of Z/2-graded linear algebra.  This was when supersymmetry was just
hitting the shores of mathematics, and Witten was starting to work
his wonders.

Anyway, index theory is just one of the first of many developments
where ideas from physics met ideas from branches of math that seemed
to have nothing to do with physics.

In the heyday of Bourbaki, I guess pure mathematics seemed very
removed from physics.  It's fun to read what Dieudonne says about
mathematical physics in his "Panorama of Pure Mathematics".  By now,
the situation has completely reversed in many fields, starting with
differential geometry and topology, but then moving on to certain
areas of algebra, and algebraic geometry, and now category theory,
especially higher category theory....

This process has caused friction at every stage.  Physicists
don't always enjoy the intrusion of more mathematics into their various
fields!   Mathematicians don't always enjoy the intrusion of more
physics - or the fast-paced, exploratory, sometimes sloppy cognitive
style of physicists.  You may recall Jaffe and Quinn's worries about
the impact of physics on mathematics:

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.HO/9307227

and how Atiyah in reply called for mathematicians to adopt the
more "buccaneering" style of physics:

http://www.ams.org/bull/pre-1996-data/199430-2/199430-2TOC.html

which led Mac Lane to respond with the ballad of Captain Kidd:

http://www.math.nsc.ru/LBRT/g2/english/ssk/proof_is_necessary.pdf

The interesting big question is: how has this increased interaction
both helped and hurt mathematics and physics?  Clearly there are
benefits.  But does math become too "trendy" by chasing after links
with the latest ideas of string theory?  Does physics lose sight of
its real purpose by focusing too much on mathematical elegance?

There are lots of issues here.  I've gone on too long already to
want to tackle them now.  But I think it's fair to say that that
mathematics has benefited more than physics.  One reason is that
theories of physics do not need to be correct - i.e., apply to
this particular universe of ours - to be mathematically interesting.

Indeed, the funny thing about string theory is that while leading
to an abundant harvest of rigorous mathematical results, it has
not yet correctly predicted a single result from a single experiment,
even after more than 20 years of work on the part of many smart people.

This is part of a more general malaise in the theoretical side of
fundamental physics, which various people have been commenting on
recently:

http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=307

http://www.nyas.org/publications/UpdateUnbound.asp?UpdateID=41

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/where_we_stand/

So, it's possible that string theory will eventually fall out
of fashion.  This could change the current dynamic between math and
physics.  A lot will depend on the results from the LHC particle
accelerator, due to start operation in 2007.   It may get evidence
for string theory; it may not.

Anyway, I'm sure these comments won't put your worries to rest!
They're not really meant to.  I just think it's good to see the
issue of "category theory and string theory" as part of a much
bigger and more complicated mess.  :-)

Best,
jb

Dear John,

Thanks for your candid and informative letter. I feel that few people who so
far have responded to me (or to others in the discussion that I started)
really understand what my concerns are.

Your comments were very interesting and of course they will not put my
worries to rest. I am grateful, though,  for your taking this as part of a
larger issue, on which I could expand more, but will not, since all I wanted
was to raise awareness, not to preach (or even less to police).

Best thoughts,
Marta

Category theory, and for that matter modern (as opposed to elementary)
algebra, is to mathematics as mathematics is to physics, and for that
matter to computer science.  Whereas mathematics organizes reasoning
about the phenomena studied by physicists and computer scientists,
algebra and category theory perform a similar function for mathematics.

In any setting organization is desirable, and arguably necessary on
occasion.  But the use of algebra and category theory to organize
physics and computer science is a double whammy here.  One should
therefore be doubly sympathetic of those physicists and computer
scientists who want to know what substantive contribution is being made
to their subject and can't evaluate the answers because they are one if
not two levels removed from the necessary abstractions.

Dear Paul,


>I suggest that he and Marta Bunga should go for a long walk to calm down.

First of all, my name is Marta Bunge (not Bunga), in case you never saw it
written. Secondly, I do not understand why Eduardo and I are put together in
this, when we wrote independently to the categolries list -- is it because
we are both Argentinians? (The Malvinas-Falklands war is over and both of
our governments profitted from it; no need to keep the antagonism open.)
Thirdly, I cannot go for a long walk in this weather (very cold in Montreal,
in case you did not know), although your advice is probably good (my doctors
would agree with you). Finally, I think that it is you who needs to take it
easy. I hope that from now on this discussion will be civilized and about
ideas, not people -- or else I will be really sorry that I started it!

Best wishes,
Marta

Dear Vincent,

I am glad that you posted your reply to me. You raise questions that many of
us have and that really relate to what I was trying to convey.  I hope that
your letter is widely read. I will only comment on one aspect of it.

I see nothing wrong in seeking funding for serious and well-motivated
research. Young people have to eat too! What I worry about (this I did not
say before) is that this craze for funding may drive researchers to accept
*any* kind of funding, thinking naively that there are no strings (no pun
intended) attached. When I was young, I once rejected NATO funding and,
since there was no other source of funding for me at the moment, I had to
go back to Argentina for two years and thus interrupt my graduate studies
at Penn. Nowadays, it is the turn of organizations such as the Templeton
Foundation (seeking to conciliate science with religion) which offer
"graciously" to fund (and lavishly so) many projects in philosophy,
physics and mathematics.

Examples of Templeton funding are increasingly found: take the Perimeter
Insitute (String Theory), the Godel Centennary Symposium in Vienna (Logic
and Foundations), the workshop organized by A. Connes at the Sir Isaac
Newton Insititue in Cambridge (Non Commutative Algebra), and others that
are mentioned in Nature, for instance. This is all for public consumption
-- just look at their web sites. Some of us find this really scary. That
is why I do not put the getting of grants as a priority-- good science and
good mathematics should always be the main priority.

But then, you will ask, how do we feed graduate students, postdocs and
unemployed category theorists? I do not know, but certainly not by resorting
to dubious sources of funding. Not that it has happened yet! Forgive my
"using" your comment to give way to a deep source of worry, certainly not
unrelated to what I have been saying since the beginning of this discussion.


As for

>2/ Will be the rebirth of category - I bet!


This is partly what I was asking -- are we (CT) in such a poor state that we
need to be reborn in another guise? Maybe so, but I am just too immersed in
my own (certainly not main stream) work to really judge. You are not the
only one to suggest that we need an uplift. That may be so, but is it the
reason for thinking it merely that there are no grants coming our way these
days --  except when we (say that we) work in matters of interest to
physics?

It seems that I have only questions to ask -- not solutions to give. I
apologize for that.


Best wishes,
Marta

I join Bob in saying that I fully agree with Marta, and I fully agree with
Bob's second sentence. However, I have a problem with "look the gift horse
in the mouth", since the horses we get are so often headless...

I would also like to make just one comment to Paul's message (although I
disagree with most of it; sorry!). Paul says:

"Which generation was it that alienated other mathematicians by making
outrageous claims about the foundations of mathematics that it never
backed up with theorems?   Which generation actually got its hands dirty
and proved the theorems that relate category theory to other foundational
disciplines?"

Well, our colleagues active in the 1960s and 70s invented elementary
toposes, for example, and proved many theorems about them. Those theorems
did not convince set-theorists to forget sets, but are they convinced now?
On the other hand those theorems were very beautiful, along with many others
from several areas of category theory; I would describe 1960s and 70s as
Golden Age of category theory. I am not saying of course that nothing
important was discovered after 70s, but I see problems, and growing chaos,
often created by ambitiously presented pseudo-relations with "other
foundational disciplines".

Moreover, talking about "relations": According to the classical work of
Sammy and Saunders, the first "relation" was with algebraic topology. As we
all know, there are various (co)homology/homotopy functors from topological
spaces to groups, or to more complicated algebraic (or coalgebraic, Hopf,
etc.) structures. There are also simplicial sets and other combinatorial
intermediate players, and the relationship between geometric and
combinatorial objects goes back to Euler (if not to Plato...). As we know
from 1960s, the universal property of Yoneda embedding yields various
adjoint functors, including those between simplicial sets and topological
spaces - and this is why combinatorial objects are there! And what do recent
algebraic topology text books do instead of explaining this? They are still
talking about gluing cells instead. I think if we really care about
relations between category theory and "other foundational disciplines", we
should begin by explaining that category theory is not just a language
allowing one to call homology a functor, but that category theory has
beautiful constructions and results (some already from 1940s and 50s!)
making enormous simplifications/applications/illuminations in neighbour
areas of pure mathematics, such as abstract algebra, geometry, and logic.

Vincent, you sound like this Beatles song, you know, in the White
Album... Fully agree with you on the essentials of point 2 (you know
that). However,  uncritically referring to vociferations out of a
some hate blog only because the blogger is labeled "string theorist"
is not unlike point 1, at least in my modest opinion.

Among the problems with the way research is sponsored there is this
particularly modern one:  the commitment to the short-term. It is
quite similar to what happens in other sectors of the globalised
society (of "high civilisation index" as L.Motl would presumably say
-:( ) and leads to a growing disbalance in the allocation of
resources. Cats are a very fine tool to organise concepts and proofs.
Surprisingly enough, most mathematicians are quite reluctant or
openly hostile. On the high-end, cat theory is crucial when it comes
down to unify seemingly disparate areas of maths (which is unlikely a
goal for itself) and this kind of work is quite clearly long-term.

My 2 p: cat theory needs to be demystified in first place rather than
to be sold. In particular, I think that the (still somehow ongoing)
debate if it is a better foundation for maths or not is absolutely
pointless.

Now we have the best of both worlds: quantum computing :-))

Well Robert, you are right in every particular fact and detail about
Einstein and about relativity, there is not question about this. But there
is not question either that is not Einstein or relativity that concern us
here.

I am right about the fact that introducing Einstein and differential
geometry into our present discussion on the interaction of string theory
and category theory was an infantile attempt to attack Motl's views. Worst
than that, it introduces a distraction to Marta's principal issues.

I can not be on the side of Motl, neither on the side of Baez, since I am
ignorant about string theory. I point out that the Motl-Baez interaction
gives rise to important issues that concern what it is good and what is
bad mathematics or physics. In particular, what is good and what is bad
category theory. Also, the meaning and profitable consequences of being in
a fashionable subject. These issues were clearly exposed in Marta's
postings, and we should be ready to talk about them publicly.

In March 16 we got very good and pertinent postings that make us see other
angles, think and learn: Baez's, Paul Taylor's, Dusko's and Vincent
Shmitt's postings.

Silences are also meaningful.

e.d.

	(1) At the very small scale, nobody has really managed to unify quantum
mechanics (which is as thoroughly tested on its home turf as relativity
is on its own) with general relativity. QM works astonishingly  well on
the atomic scale, GR works astonishingly well on the astronomical scale,
but there is a big gap, "in which we live", in which neither is
particularly evident and classical Newtonian mechanics   works pretty
well for most purposes.

	(2) At very large scales there is some question as to whether
additional forces, not predicted by general relativity, are needed to
explain some cosmological observations. This is more speculative, but a
lot of physicists seem to think *something* needs to be done.

"generalised abstract nonsense"
I'm pretty sure it was current while I was a grad student at princeton
1956-58

it wasn't necessarily perjorative

category theory certainly applies marvelously to knot theory

but Yetter should wade in on that aspect

I just got a note from Jon's daughter that Jon died suddenly on March 11.
She did not go into detail as to the circumstances.  Nadine's email
address is pearbeck@aol.com if anyone would like to write her.  She is
soliciting personal reminiscences either to be read at the memorial
service she has planned or privately to her, whichever you choose.

It just occurred to me that to justify such viewpoint we might have to look
at the point in time when mathematics began to become abstracted out from
natural sciences to see whether category theory is already in the same
position with respect to the rest of mathematics.

Although I certainly do not know enough history of science, I will still
dare to speculate that the situation now is completely different from what
it was then. I believe mathematics as a substantial part of the body of
scientific knowledge did exist and evolve long long before it began to be
considered as some separate entity which can be used to organize the rest -
in fact many people still think of mathematics as just another science on
completely equal footing with, say, biology or physics.

Whereas birth and development of category theory has been, I think, much
more deliberate, abrupt and discontinuous in comparison. If this is so, one
possible conclusion might be that probably category theorists simply want
too much too soon. Maybe they should be more patient and let their
discipline become stronger within the body of mathematics before forcibly
declaring it a new organizing force outside the rest of mathematics. This is
as if a child would be forced to care for its parents shortly after being
born.

Dear all,
	Picking up on the funding issue.  I've served on the
NSF Advisory panel, though many years ago, so I'm familiar with some
of the issues with federal funding.

The worst of it from my experience is that it takes universities
off the hook as to supporting research directly, as opposed to being only
a channel for external funds.  Worse yet, tenure and promotion decisions
are increasingly based on external support (at least in the US)
thus the university doesn't trust its own faculty.

Also involved is a bureaucratic aspect: it's more efficient to
process a large grant with multiple researchers.

In the ``good ole days'', math in the US has essentially NO post-docs.

I think knot theory is particularly helpful here but I'll let Yetter and
Freyd reply further.

Dear George,

I think the straight answer is that it is genuinely difficult.

Even for elementary applications it is not easy. Try asking non-
categorical topologists how they explain the product topology to
students. Many will say, "This definition may look odd, but it turns
out to work best." Others will produce various ad hoc justifications,
such as "It's the definition that makes Tychonoff's theorem
true." (Though that may be at least historically correct.)   You
point out that the product topology is the unique one such that
projections are continuous and tupling preserves continuity,  but
they still don't see that as anything special.

But with regard to certain advanced applications, there are pictures
in the minds of the category theorists that do not translate at all
easily to paper. Even the master expositors find it hard. I'm
thinking for example of the idea of topos as generalized space.

I have been working seriously with toposes (usually as generalized
spaces) for about 15 years now and in some respects my understanding
of them is quite deep. Yet there is still a huge gap in my
understanding when it comes to their applications in algebraic
geometry, Galois theory and algebraic topology, the kind of fields
that gave rise to toposes in the first place. Somehow when I read the
accounts I see a mass of machinery but no clear intuitions for what
it is doing. This surprises me. A characteristic strength of category
theory is that it is particularly good at explaining the underlying
meaning of constructions, with its notion of universal properties,
and with some beautiful tricks of categorical logic.

So is it possible to explain, or illuminate, those particular
categorical applications to someone like me? (Perhaps the challenge
has already been met, and I've just missed the right book; and of
course I eagerly await vol. 3 of the Elephant.)

Here's a sample question where my categorical understanding falls
short of the applications.

If A is an Abelian group, then the space ^A of A-torsors is also a
group (modulo canonical isomorphisms - the equational laws of group
theory do not necessarily hold up to equality). The identity element
is the regular representation of A on itself, group multiplication is
"tensor product" of torsors, and inverses are got by inverting the A-
action.

It follows that if X is any space, then the collection of continuous
maps from X to ^A is also a group, and this construction is self-
evidently contravariant in X.

Obviously it takes topos theory to formalize this, but already we can
paint a picture.

For example, suppose A is the cyclic group C_2 of order 2 and X is
the circle. Then there are (classically) two isomorphism classes of
maps T: X -> ^A, essentially because in going once right round the
circle the variable torsor T(x) can come back either just how it
started or with an automorphism swapping its two elements. The
corresponding group is C_2.

This looks like some kind of cohomology, so is it already part of the
standard theory? I've never managed to follow all the machinery through.

All the best,

Steve Vickers

Dear Friends,

     It is happening much too often during this past year. Discussions,
whose continuation has been too long delayed, are forever ended by the sad
passing of a colleague. Particularly poignant for me is the loss of my
friend and collaborator from Varenna and the ETH in 1966 and in the Zurich
Triples book (SLNM No. 80). Beyond his famous and far-reaching results on
tripleability, intensive discussions with Jon led to some of the points
raised in my paper in that book.

The word "doctrine" itself is entirely due to him and signifies something
which is like a theory, except appropriate to be interpreted in the
category of categories, rather than, for example, in the category of sets;
of course, an important example of a doctrine is a 2-monad, and among
2-monads there are key examples whose category of "algebras" is actually a
category of theories in the set-interpretable sense. Among such
"theories of theories", there is a special kind whose study I proposed in
that paper. This kind has come to be known as "Kock-Zoeberlein"
doctrine in honor of those who first worked out some of the basic
properties and ramifications, but the recognition of its probable
importance had emerged from those discussions with Jon.

In those days Jon was insistent on mathematical clarity and did much to
encourage precision in discussions and in the formulation of mathematical
results.

   We lovingly remember him from those youthful days.

		Bill

Dear categorists,

I recently proved that products (or coproducts) in a compact closed
category are necessarily biproducts, and I'm wondering whether this
is a known theorem. I can't find any reference to it in the
literature, but the proof is not hugely complicated and it would
not surprise me to learn that someone noticed it before this week!

(More precisely, I can prove that given a monoidal category that has
(finite) sums and products, if the tensor distributes over the sums
on one side and the products on the other -- e.g. for every object A,
-*A preserves sums and A*- preserves products -- then the products and
coproducts are both really biproducts.)

Any references or recollections will be much appreciated.

Yours,
Robin

    Together with many others, I am deeply saddened by the death of
George Mackey. For far too long, I had been delaying the trip to see him
and continue our discussions which had started in the "Weyl'sche Kammer"
at the ETH in Zurich and continued in the physics center in Trieste. Long
before I met him, his insights into mathematics and into quantum mechanics
had been informing my own thinking. It was the study of his book on
quantum mechanics in 1967 which led directly to the joint course by
Saunders Mac Lane and me at the University of Chicago. But his relation to
category theory goes back much further than that, as Saunders and Sammy
had explained to me.

    George Mackey's Ph.D. thesis displayed remarkable thinking of a
categorical nature, even before categories had been defined. Specifically,
the fact that the category of Banach spaces and continuous linear maps is
fully embedded into a category of pairings of abstract vector spaces,
together with the definition and use of "Mackey convergence" of a sequence
in a "bornological" vector space were discovered there and have played a
basic role in some form in nearly every book on functional analysis since.
What is perhaps unfortunately not clarified in nearly every book on
functional analysis, is that these concepts are intensely categorical in
character and that further enlightenment would result if they were so
clarified.

   And who, despite initial skepticism, permitted the first paper giving
an exposition of the theory of categories to see the light of day in the
Transactions of the AMS in 1945? None other than the referee, George
Whitelaw Mackey.

   Sincerely,
		F. William Lawvere

Hi

To follow are the contents of two postings that Bob (always vigilant, ja!)
thought best to concatenate in only one.

On spite of Robert's erudition and his knowledgeable discourse, I still
think Einstein using differential geometry to develop general relativity
is not at the same level that John Baez using category theory to develop
and/or understand string theory. His arguments are valid in a court of
law, but do not convince me. I imagine John himself is probably the first
to laugh at such a comparison.

But this is not the issue of my present posting. He touches also some
pertinent points that go more to the core of the "cracks_and_pots" debate.

(In between ** are Robert  words)

What Motl says certainly does not make people using category theory in
string theory laugh. Applications of category theory to string (or to
other physical theories competing with string theory ?, see Yetter's
posting, it is all very confusing !!) may be valuable or may not. I (and a
lot of us) can not tel.

** In which case demands that they ($) be read out of the meeting are
premature.
($) papers that claim applications to physics **

This is a difficult question.

Marta was saying (and Bob Walters and others agree) that when a paper was
claiming applications to physics it was easily accepted without
knowledgeable and close examination, and that there were a lot of them.

Probably a lot of them should be read out, but not by policy against (as
it was erroneously interpreted in these postings). Serious refereeing is a
healthy practice that should not be equaled with censorship.

**Remember - in mathematics it's a matter of "In God We Trust,
everybody else must provide a proof."**

This is not so much so. Speculations in math are very difficult. If not
well founded they are vacuous. Only great mathematicians can do them
(example close to us, Grothendieck), the rest of us must provide a proof.

**If the math itself meets mathematical standards of rigor, its
application to physics need surely only meet the standards appropriate to
that subject.**

The math itself must also meet standards of quality, not only of rigor.
Besides that, "standards appropriate to that subject" does not mean "free
for anything". Motl writes:

"I always feel very uneasy if the mathematically oriented people present
their conjectures about physics, quantum gravity, or string theory as some
sort of "obvious facts."

Clearly he is  saying that these standards are not being fulfilled (in his
opinion of course) by claimed applications of math to physics.

Motl  may be wrong or he may be right, what we have not seen yet in these
postings is a convincing or clear answer to the questions he arises. I
would say, not even an answer at all.

These questions triggered Marta's original posting, which in turn was
arising other (not exactly the same) questions. I do not agree necessarily
with Marta's implicit views, what I support is her courage to point out
that they are serious problems in the category theory community (for
example, quality of the publications, abuse of fashionable topics to get
grants, invited speakers in CT meetings).

Best wishes    e.d.

Eduardo having preferred (wisely) not to try to edit down both sides of
a  discussion with a lot of quoting, I will follow his lead and
summarize one side of it with context quotes from the other side.

Eduardo Dubuc wrote (in part)

 > geometry into our present discussion on the interaction of string theory
 > and category theory was an infantile attempt to attack Motl's views.
Worst
 > than that, it introduces a distraction to Marta's principal issues.

I responded:

     Sorry, Eduardo. I refuse to write out a hundred times "I will not
attempt to attack the views of Lubos Motl".

     As for introducing distractions, Marta suggested (Mar. 12) that we
should as a community not "quietly accept getting discredited by a
minority of us presumably applying category theory to string theory",
and that we should "react and point out that this is not what (all of)
category theory is about" and "give a thought about what we, as a
community, can urgently do to repair this damaging impression."  On Mar.
14, it was suggested that meeting organizers might want to take this
into account while choosing invited speakers.

     Now, I do accept that there are such things as bad mathematics and
bad physics. However, this call for collective action against an entire
field of research seems uncomfortably close to an organized boycott, an
extreme enough breach of tradition that only an emergency - if that -
could justify it. And, in such circumstances, the question of whether
the emergency really  exists is certainly relevant, and not (_pace_
George W. Bush) a presumptuous distraction.

     My response (Mar. 14) was twofold. I suggested that the general
credibility of category theory does not depend on the credibility of its
applications to physics.  But I also pointed out, which I think is even
more relevant, that physicists are quite used to tentative theories
being studied for many years before they are accepted or rejected, and
that there is no loss of credibility among physicists for those involved
in this process.  Neils Bohr is not remembered as "that crackpot who
thought the atom was like a solar system".

     Note that only credibility among physicists is at stake here.
Mathematicians are unlikely to base a negative judgement of _any_ branch
of mathematics on what physicists may be doing with it, and in
particular know perfectly well that this is not "what all of category
theory is about". The rest of the world will not have a clue what all of
category theory is about, and will never know the debate took place.

     We expect mathematics to be correct by the time it sees print;
internal consistency is a comparatively easy goal.  Physics, despite
using almost as many equations, has a real and sometimes uncooperative
universe to contend with, and cannot afford the luxury of progressing
only through unassailable, permanently-established truths.  Mathematics
was once in a similar position:  we recognize the genius of Euclid's
axiomatic system  even while realizing that (by our standards) it was
fatally flawed. (Why do the circles in Euc.I.1 intersect? None of his
axioms assert that any pair of circles whatsoever do so.)  Ramanujan is
perhaps alone among modern mathematicians in having been permitted, by
general consent, something like the latitude to err freely that the
physics community customarily grants itself - and his was a very special
case. Had he lived to see the greater part of his work in print, he too
would have proved, retracted, or labelled as conjecture many of the
speculative claims that ended up as his legacy.

     I mentioned Einstein in passing, assuming that readers would have
some idea of the initial skepticism with which relativity was viewed,
and the length of time it took before that skepticism ceased to be
justified. (Actual hostility was a separate, later, phenomenon, more
related to antisemitism and Stalinism than to physics.)  If I assumed
too much, and should have explained more, I apologize.

Eduardo then responded (in part)

 > Einstein using differential geometry to develop general relativity is
not at the same level that John Baez using category theory to develop
and/or understand string theory. I imagine John himself is probably the
first to laugh at such a comparison.

and I responded to that (in part)

     If category theory happens to be the approach that works, and
significant progress is made in fundamental physics as a result, it will
be very much on the same level as relativity.

     If it isn't, it will be, from most physicists' point of view, an
honorable attempt on the same level as many other theories such as  the
steady-state universe, tachyons (Remember tachyons? No? _They_ remember
_you_...), magnetic monopoles,  or the luminiferous ether, that were
seriously considered in the past by respectable physicists.

     Until the results are in, it is, I think, not unreasonable to make
comparisons with Einstein's early work on relativity - at a time when
Einstein could not get results consistent with observation and many of
his talented contemporaries had serious doubts about whether he was
using the right approach. (Not whether he was a fool or a charlatan,
just whether he was using the right approach.)  Or, equally, with
Einstein's later work on quantum mechanics, when history seems to have
shown that he backed the wrong horse - but it was not so clear at the time.

Dear category theorists,
I would like to support Krzysztof Worytkiewicz's remark that "cat theory
needs to be demystified in first place rather than to be sold" from a
different side: I have recently come across several publications and
research projects of philosophers who have become over-enthusiastic with
category theory. In certain circles category theory seems to have gained a
nimbus of an all-encompassing theory of everything, be it part of
mathematics or not, see for example
http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2000/10/msg02048.html for an expression
of such opinions or http://ru.philosophy.kiev.ua/rodin/Endurance.htm for a
crude offspring of them. Such exaggerated propaganda is very likely to cause
railings like the one of Lubos Motl. Has anyone observed the same phenomenon
or does it only exist among the people I have to do with?

All the best,

Peter

I had not heard that Mackey had died and am also saddened, although I
never met him.

Bill does not mention that Mackey's thesis, I think it was published in
the same volume of the Transactions as "General Theory of natural
equivalances", was the direct source of the Chu construction.  As Bill
mentioned the category of pairs embeds the category of Banach spaces
(and continuous linear maps).  It is in fact equivalent to the category of
what are now called Mackey spaces, which are characterized as the locally
convex topological vector spaces that have the finest possible topology
for their set of continuous linear functionals.

I once wrote to Mackey asking him if he had had any intention of
considering a space of linear functionals as a _replacement_ for a
topology or merely an adjunct to it.  Unfortunately, he did not reply,
even to a snail mail "letter" (as we used to call them).

As it happens it was just yesterday that I sent off the followin abstract
of the talk I will give in the category session of the Canadian Math. Soc.
meeting in Calgary in early June:


A standard theorem says that any locally convex topological vector space
has a finer topology, its \emph{Mackey topology} with the same set of
continuous linear functionals and that is the finest possible topology
with that property.  If $E$ and $F$ are two such spaces topologize the
space $\mbox{Hom(E,F)}$ of continuous linear transformations $E\to F$
with the weak topology induced by the algebraic tensor product $E\otimes
F'$ and then let $[E,F]$ denote the associated Mackey topology.  Let
$F^*$ denote the dual $F'$ topologized by the Mackey topology on the
weak dual and let $E\otimes F=[E,F^*]^*$ (whose underlying vector space
is the algebraic tensor product).  Then for any Mackey spaces $E$, $F$,
and $G$,
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item $[E\otimes F,G]\cong [E,[F,G]]$
 \item $E\cong E^*{}^*$
 \item $[E,F]\cong (E\otimes F^*)^*$
\end{enumerate}
 which is summarized by saying that the category of Mackey spaces and
continuous linear transformations is $*$-autonomous.

This category is equivalent to the category of weakly topologized
locally convex topological vector spaces (which have the coarsest
possible topology for their set of continuous linear functionals) which
is therefore also $*$-autonomous.  They are also equivalent to the chu
category of vector spaces (which will be explained).

Dear Mike,

Looking into the MathSciNet, I see that:

Mackey's 1942 thesis was published in abbreviated form in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 29 (1943). The Math Reviews
reviewer seems to clearly understand that part of idea was to replace open
sets with linear functionals.

The extended publication in the Transactions was in vol. 57 (1945) whereas
the publication of Eilenberg and Mac Lane's famous paper was in vol. 58.
In the same volume 58 there is a paper by Clifford Truesdell.

Best, Bill

That is, is there a finite set of universal Horn formulas entailing the
common universal Horn theory of groups and free monoids?

In other words, what do groups and free monoids have in common, besides
being monoids?

Apart from the (equational) axioms for monoids, the only members of that
theory I can think of are xy=x -> y=1 and yx=x -> y=1.

2.  How different is the abelian case?  More or fewer axioms?

In axiomatic mathematics, everything that is not forbidden is permitted.
Circles can climb trees and drape themselves over branches in Dali's
axiomatization of geometry, not because he says they can but because he
is not the strict disciplinarian that Euclid is.  Euclid insists that
his circles shape up or else.  This creates many problems for the
circles but few problems for mathematicians as their managers.  Dali
runs a looser ship, which lets the circles lead a less structured life
while creating more problems for mathematicians.  This is a win-win
situation: the circles end up with fewer neuroses while the
mathematicians thrive, problems being their lifeblood.  Thank god for
Lobachevsky and the others we can't remember because Tom Lehrer didn't.

Hi,

I thought that my intention in raising the issues that I did in my original
posting of March 12 were clear enough. Now it seems that they were not, to
some.

1.
I find ridiculous the suggestion put forward by Robert Dawson (March
23)  that my presumed "call for collective action against an entire field
of research seems uncomfortably close to an organized boycott, an extreme
breach of tradition that only an emergency -if that - could justify it".

The invention of an alleged "boycott" plot seems aimed at dismissing the
questions that I (and other concerned mathematicians who joined the
discussion) have raised. Anybody who, like Robert Dawson, resorts to such
inventions appears to be panicking in that he is trying to divert attention
from, rather than help, a healthy discussion.


2.
Eduardo Dubuc writes: "I do not agree necessarily with Marta's implicit
views". There is nothing implicit in my views. Just take a second look at my
various postings of March 14, 15, and 17 in reply to some people. If Eduardo
refers to my bringing in the Templeton Foundation into the discussion, then
I would like to add some comments, partly expanding (and correcting) my
reply to Vincent Schmitt (March 17).

I can back up my contentions in reference to the the Goedel Centenary
Symposium in Vienna

http://www.logic.at/goedel2006/

and the workshop organized by A. Connes at the Sir Isaac Newton Institue in
Cambridge (Non Commutative Algebra)

http://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/programmes/NCG/ncgw02


I should, however, make more precise my reference to the Perimeter Institute
for Mathematical Physicts. What sems clear is that one of its most prominent
long-term researchers is at the same time one of the prominent particpants
in Templeton funding and activties, for instance the Foundational Questions
Institute. I quote from the last issue of Nature

http://www.fqxi.org/about.html

"Phycists to confront those big questions. Time travel, multiple universes
and extraterrestrial intelligence seem more the purview of Star Trek
scriptwriters than of serious researchers. (...) The FQI was set up last
October with a grant from the Templeton Foundation, which promotes research
at the boundary of religion and science. With US$8 million in seed money,
the FQI will fund dozens of researcher's part-time work on these questions.
(...) "I am very happy to see that a project has started to address these
needs" says Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in
Waterloo, Ontario, who is also on the FQI's scientific advisory board.  --
Geoff Brumfield. Nature.
2 March 2006."

I stated incorrectly that the Pi is devoted to String Theory, when it seems,
judging from the work of Lee Smolin, that Pi rather promotes Loop Quantum
Gravity, a competitor to String Theory. By the way, an article by Lee Smolin
entitled "Atoms of Space and Time" on LQG has been issued already three
times (with minor variations) in Scientific American (200, 2004, 2006), so
many of you must have seen it.

3.
I have never suggested that "an entire field of research" should be suspect
of constituting bad mathematics. If by this entire field of research it is
meant n-categories, theta-categories, operads, topological quantum theories,
and so on, there is, as in any other field, good and bad mathematics.
Perhaps I should bring to your attention my comments to the organizers of
the StreetFest, requested
by them of all participants, and posted in their website as

http://streetfest.maths.mq.edu.au/feedback?lastname=Bunge&firstname=Marta

I stand by this, and only hope that my remarks in the "cracks and pots"
postings have not been misinterpreted by the people mentioned in my comment
above, and by others, like Ieke Moerdijk, not mentioned in it since they
were not there.

4.
I also think that a problem persists in the emphasis given to the "you do
not want to know" general message in Baez postings, not because of them
intrinsically, or of himself, but of the use others (for what purposes, I do
not know) are making of this general trend. One instance of this trend
(although in a different casting) is the following

http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eugenia/morality/

of a lecture that Eugenia Cheng gave in Cambridge last year.


With best wishes for (and absolute faith in) category theory,
Marta

Dear Vaughan,

1. Instead of universal Horn formulas I shall talk about quasiidentities,
which is the same thing in your context. Recall: A quasiidentity is a fir=
st
order formula of the form (P1&...&Pn)=3D>Q, where P1,...,Pn,Q are atomic
formulas (i.e. "equations of terms"). A class of universal algebras is sa=
id
to be a quasivariety if it can be axiomatized with quasiidentities.
Quasivarieties can be characterized as classes of algebras closed under
subalgebras, products, and filtered colimits (the only reason for filtere=
d
colimits is that we want n above to be finite; products and filtered
colimits can be replaced here with filtered products).

2. Since the free monoid on a set X can be considered as a submonoid of t=
he
free group on the same X, the quasivariety of monoids generated by groups
contain all free monoids. In other words, every quasiidentity that holds =
for
all groups, will also hold for all free monoids. That is, asking your
question, forget free monoids!

3. The quasivariety of monoids generated by groups obviously consists
exactly of all those monoids that can be embedded into groups. Hence one
should probably see

Malcev, A. =DCber die Einbettung von assoziativen Systemen in Gruppen.
(Russian) Rec. Math. [Mat. Sbornik] N.S. 6 (48), (1939). 331--336. MR0002=
152
(2,7d)

.
(Russian) Rec. Math. [Mat. Sbornik] N.S. 8 (50) (1940). 251--264. MR00028=
95
(2,128b)

4. I do not have these papers here in Cape Town. But I seem to remember t=
hat
Mal'tsev had an infinite list of quasi-identities which describes the
quasi-variety of monoids that can be embedded into groups. Furthermore it
seems (I am not sure) that he actually introduced the term "quasiidentity=
"
exactly for this purpose. The first non-trivial one, which he called
Condition Z, was

(as =3D bt) & (cs =3D dt) & (au =3D bv) =3D> (cu =3D dv);

this condition obviously holds in every group and therefore in every
submonoid of a group, but he constructed a semigroup with cancellation in
which it does not hold. (Here the difference between monoids and semigrou=
ps
is irrelevant here). I do not know much did Mal'tsev know about universal
constructions; once Mac Lane told me that Zariski knew them... Knowing th=
em,
one would of course begin by looking at the universal group with a
homomorphism from a given monoid into it, and taking the list of
quasiidentities from the description of the congruence involved in the
construction of that group.

5. Your idea of xy =3D x =3D> y =3D 1 and yx =3D x =3D> y =3D 1 is too ba=
d (sorry!),
because it is even weaker than the usual cancellation

xy =3D xz =3D> y =3D z and yx =3D zx =3D> y =3D z.

For, take the quotient of the free monoid on {x,y} by identifying xx =3D =
xy
(and =3D yx =3D yy if you like); it satisfies your implications but not t=
he
cancellation.

6. In the abelian case (obviously) it is just one quasiidentity, namely t=
he
cancellation. That is, the quasivariety of abelian monoids that can be
embedded into groups is determined by the axiom x + y =3D x + z =3D> y =3D=
 z.

Vaughan asks:

  Is the quasivariety of monoids generated by the groups and the free
  monoids finitely based?

The free monoids seem to be red herrings. The question is equivalent
to

  Is the quasivariety of monoids generated by the groups finitely
  based?

(since every free monoid is a submonoid of a group.)

If the answer is known I suspect it would be well-known as a theorem
about which monoids can be embedded in groups. I note that a 46-year-
old paper by S.I.Adyan is still cited.  It establishes just the
special case of cancelation monoids given by single defining
relations.

Vaughn goes on to ask

   How different is the abelian case?  More or fewer axioms?

This case is easy. Again, the free commutative monoids are free
herrings. Just add to the equational theory of commutative monoids the
cancelation principle: xy = xz -> y = z. (Every such monoid appears in
the quasivariety since its reflector into the subcat of abelian groups
is an embedding.)

Dear Vaughan

A related question, originating with the problem of the quality of the
truth value space in M- sets, led me to the discovery of an equational
class that some years later, Peter Freyd rediscovered from an entirely
different point of view.

What is the Structure of the union of the "variety" groups with the
variety of commutative monoids ? The motivation was the common feature of
the Heyting algebra of right ideals of a monoid in either class, and the
partial answer is in my "Taking categories seriously", reprinted in TAC.

Not only do we have to think about the meaning of "union" and about the
analogy with closed subschemes (probably the source of the term "variety")
but also about the fact that the inclusion of groups in monoids is more
"open" than closed and is certainly not a (sub) variety even though both
categories are algebraic. Again analogously, the Structure 2-functor,
adjoint to Semantics does not carry full inclusions to surjective
interpretations, Thus in particular in my example like others, the
algebraic theory that results has more operations, not only more
equations. It may be true in your case as well.

Dear All,

1. Are there significant or interesting examples of monads on finite
   categories?  I want to look beyond monads on posets, a.k.a. closure
   operators.  (Since a finite category with binary sums or products
   is necessarily a poset, some of the usual examples of monads reduce
   to this case.)  I can only think of one class of examples
   (described below), and I don't know if it's particularly
   significant.

2. Any monad on a finite category is idempotent.  Is this widely
   known?

Thanks.

Tom

* * *

The class of examples: let A be a finite Cauchy-complete category.
Let M be the 2-element monoid consisting of the identity and an
idempotent, so that [M, A] is the category of idempotents in A.  Then
the diagonal functor A ---> [M, A] has adjoints on both sides.  The
induced monad on A is trivial, but that on [M, A] is not.  (It sends
an idempotent e to 1_a, where a is the object through which e splits.)

The Horn formulae quoted by Vaughan can of course be generalized to the
cancellation laws:  xy = xz => y = z  (and similarly on the other side).
In fact the free monoids aren't needed: every free monoid embeds as a
submonoid of a (free) group, and so satisfies all Horn formulae true in
groups. Thus Vaughan is asking for the universal Horn theory of those
monoids which are embeddable in groups. I'm fairly sure that the answer
to this is known, but I can't find a reference for it. In the commutative
case, it's easy to see that the cancellation law is all you need (the
proof is essentially the same as the proof that every integral domain
embeds in a field), but I vaguely remember that in the non-commutative
case you need something more than the cancellation laws.

Generalizing in an obvious way: can one characterize those categories
which admit faithful functors to groupoids by a finite collection of Horn
formulae?

Thanks to Peter, Peter, and George for the uniformly equivalent answers
to my question (in striking contrast to the decided lack of uniformity
of the responses to other recent topics on this list).  (Bill's response
was less an answer than a pointer to related work with "commutative" in
place of "free" in my question, interesting but for different reasons.)
  I should have noticed that free monoids were a red herring, and I have
no idea why I restricted to z=1 in xy=xz->y=z.

The crux of the obstacle to axiomatizing the nonabelian case is clearly
brought out by Malcev's Condition Z cited by George Janelidze as

 >
 >   (as = bt) & (cs = dt) & (au = bv) => (cu = dv);
 >

If you could just shuffle the terms around, Z along with the larger
"quasiidentities" would all collapse under cancellation, as everyone
pointed out.

At first glance one might think to organize Condition Z with proof nets
of some kind, something along the lines of

au = bv
|    |
as = bt
.|    |
cs = dt
-------
cu = dv

and so on for longer such sorites along with (independent?) reflections
of each side.  (The stray dot is against mailers that delete leading
spaces, apologies to those not receiving this in a fixed-width font.)

However googling for relevant material led to a 194-page St. Andrew's
thesis submitted last July on "Presentations for subsemigroups of
groups" by Alan Cain, available at

http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~alanc/maths/publications/c_phdthesis/c_phdthesisonesided.ps

The preface indicates how one can do better via J.-C. Spehner's notion
of a Malcev presentation.  (Anyone know if this is the same J.-C.
Spehner as does computational geometry at Labo MAGE?)

Spehner's basic idea, on the semantic side, is that if it is known by
all parties (writers and readers) that the intended congruence on a
semigroup S makes S/~ embeddable in a group, then one can uniquely
determine ~ with less of it than without that knowledge.  The crucial
fact here is that the family of all congruences ~ on a semigroup S for
which S/~ embeds in a group is closed under arbitrary (including empty)
intersection (consider the product of the witnessing embedding groups).
Hence any binary relation R on a semigroup S has a unique minimal
extension to such a congruence, namely the intersection of all such
congruences containing R.  A Malcev presentation of a desired such
congruence is any binary relation R that generates it in this way.

So in particular if au = bv, as = bt, and cs = dt are all in R, then the
conclusion cu = dv of Condition Z is in this "Malcev closure" of R.

On the syntactic side, the appropriate term rewriting system
incorporating this knowledge of group-embeddability augments the
vocabulary with left and right inverses of generators, allowing this
conclusion to be obtained equationally, without resorting to
quasiidentities, as

cu = csSu = dtSu = dBbtSu = dBasSu = dBau = dBbv = dv

where I've written S for the right inverse of s and B for the left
inverse of b for want of a third flavor of s and b in ASCII.

After developing the basis for, and variants of, all this, the thesis
then dives into automatic semigroups, a subject with a rich literature
and some very deep results that I have so far been completely unable to
motivate myself to participate in (starting with Michael Arbib's
lectures on this general genre at Sydney University in the Australian
winter of 1967, give or take a winter, and then more lectures in the
same vein in 1969 by John Rhodes at Berkeley).  Maybe some day I'll see
the point of it all, though so far I've had more success eventually
seeing the point of Max Kelly's 1965 lectures on category theory, that
only took two decades (slow learner).  I'm fine with algebraic logic
(which was my route back to category theory in 1983), algebraic automata
theory seems an altogether different kettle of fish -- the deployment of
weapons of math destruction in an unwinnable war on the combinatorial
complexity of automata and semigroups.

Again, many thanks for the answers and pointers!

Vaughan Pratt

Fellow categorists,

Jim Stasheff has been appealing to me to comment on the role of=20
category theory in knot theory in the context of the =91cracks and pots=92=
=20
thread.

In that regard, let me begin with the story I tell in the introduction=20=

to my book:

At a Joint Summer Research conference a number of years back, Moishe=20
Flato at some point offered the usual dismissal of category theory--=91it=20=

is a mere language=92.  Kolya Reshetikhin and I undertook that evening =
to=20
disabuse him of the notion by explaining Shum=92s coherence theorem (the=20=

one-object version, being =91the braided monoidal category with =
two-sided=20
duals compatible with the braiding is monoidally equivalent to the=20
category of framed tangles=92).  This is a remarkable theorem--a=20
structure absolutely natural from the internal structure of category=20
theory is essentially identical to the key geometric sturctures in 3-=20
and 4-manifold topology, framed tangles being simply =91relative =
versions=20
of=92 the framed links on which the Kirby calculi for 3- and 4-manifolds=20=

depend.  It is one of several theorems relating category theory, and=20
with it  a great deal of algebra, to geometric topology, all of which=20
had a =93who ordered that?=94 feel about them.  It is also the only =
basis=20
on which the connection between knot theory and quantum groups can be=20
explained:  the category of representations of a quantum group has the=20=

algebraic structure for which framed tangles are a free model!

I retired before the point had sunk in, leaving Kolya to continue the=20
discussion.  The next morning as I sat in the back of the main lecture=20=

hall, Flato came in, tapped me on the shoulder, and with a thumbs up,=20
said =93Hey! Viva les categories!. . .these new ones, the braided=20
monoidal ones.=94

Now, Shum=92s theorem is merely the first of several, all of which give=20=

one the =93who ordered that?=94 impression, at least once on starts=20
thinking of TQFT=92s.  The other two that come to mind require a bit of=20=

set up to state fully, but I will spare you all now:  they are Abrams=20
theorem that a 2-dimensional TQFT is equivalent to a Frobenius algebra,=20=

and a theorem due to myself and Crane, and Kerler, that in a certain=20
category of cobordisms between surfaces with boundary, the handle (a=20
torus with a hole cut in it) has the structure of a Hopf algebra (CY,=20
K) which is self-dual (CY) and admits a right integral (K), and that=20
every surface with a circle boundary is a Yetter-Drinfel=92d module over=20=

the handle.  (For an ordinary finite dimensional Hopf algebra,=20
YD-modules are modules over the Drinfel=92d double, but they exist more=20=

generally, for infinite dimensional Hopf algebras or Hopf algebra=20
objects in arbitrary monoidal categories, where Drinfel=92d doubles =
don=92t=20
exist.)

All of these are part and parcel of a different face of category theory=20=

than one saw in the old days:  category theory as algebra, rather than=20=

category theory as foundations.

Flato=92s dismissal was directed at category theory as foundations.  It=20=

is easily ignored if one is interested in foundations of mathematics,=20
since most mathematicians really don=92t care about foundations.  For=20
example, many mathematicians pay lip service to the attitude =91set=20
theory is =91the=92 foundation of mathematics=92, but then turn around =
and=20
talk about =91the real numbers=92.  Which =91real numbers=92?  Dedekind =

equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences? a complete Archimedian field=20

question is silly:  one doesn=92t bother asking which of a family of=20
isomorphic structures one means, because they are isomorphic.  It is in=20=

the practical sense of describing the basic structure of what=20
mathematicians actually do, that category theory is a superior=20
=91foundation=92 to set theory.  (Was there ever a time when the epsilon=20=

  The dim view of category theory in many mathematical circles is surely=20=

due to mathematicians=92 boredom with foundations--and attitude which=20
might be summed up as =93Set theory was bad enough.  Why open up all=20
those questions again? Just let me do my geometry, algebra, or=20
whatever.=94

I reading this thread, I wonder how much of the concern about public=20
perceptions of category theory is really concern that =91categories as=20=

algebra=92 has become the public face of category theory, concern on the=20=

part of those who are fond of =91categories as foundations=92.

=91Categories as foundations=92 served the subject poorly in relations =
to=20
most mathematicians, but well in relation to computer science:  only=20
categorists were willing to take up the challenge of polymorphic type=20
theory.  If you thought =91set theory is *the* foundation=92, you bashed=20=

your head against Russell=92s paradox and were no help the the folk in=20=

CS. We (really those of *you* who took up the challenge) were the only=20=

mathematicians who had any hope of being helpful.

On the other hand, those of us who set our sights on =91core =

to knot theory (and geometric topology more generally), homotopy=20

Hi David,
then, i again, to precise my thoughts.

Knot theory is trivially a good thing.
That category has to do with it does
not surprise anybody reading this
thread. You can relax...
Personnaly, and as a matter of taste, i would
not put for instance polymorphic types is the
same bag. But... ok, say.

Now that theoretical physics, computer
science, phylo., a mix of those, or whatever? ,
is used to justify poor "categorical" work is,
in my view, an existing problem. More or less
everyone is conscious of it (come on!...) but so far
that has not been publically debated.  I am happy
that it happens now.

So I am sorry not share the enthusiastic
mood that everything is good in maths
and I wish that our colleagues "categorists"
take categories... humm... seriously.
Again, i should not be the one who says
that.

Best,
Vincent.

PS: since you averted your book - can we get
a good price?

WHY ARE WE CONCERNED? I
	When Saunders Mac Lane penned his hard-hitting 1997 Synthese
article, he was defending mathematics from an attack many of us hoped
would just go away. But Saunders was aware of the seriousness of the
threat, which indeed is still here with greater determination.
Although the title of that article was "Despite physicists, proof is
essential in mathematics", he was not opposing physics, nor even that
immediate handful who, assuming the mantle of "mathematical physicists",
gave themselves license to insult generations of scrupulously serious
physicists and to demand that mathematics adopt a culture that considers
conjecture as nearly-established truth. In essence it was an attack on
science itself, as the highest form of knowing, that Saunders was
opposing.
	The increased determination of that attack is expressed in two
ways. To equip and organize the attack, finance capital has set up several
institutions, some of which rather openly proclaim their goal of
submitting science to the service of medieval obscurantism. Others say
that they support mathematical research, but encourage a barrage of
"popular" writings to shock and awe the public into continuing in the
belief that they will never understand mathematics and hence never be able
to actively participate in science.
	The contempt for Mac Lane's fight, recently expressed in articles
supposedly memorializing him, takes the form of the claim that category
theory itself is a "cool" instrument for deepening obscurantism. Not only
Harvard's "When is one thing equal to another thing?" and the Cambridge
"morality" muddle, but also a 2003 article aimed at teachers of
undergraduates, quite explicitly support that claim. In the MAA Monthly, a
Clay Fellow states as fact that category theory "is mathematics with the
substance removed". Mastering the technique of disinformation whereby the
readers are first told that now finally they will be informed, the article
suggests that some raising of the level of understanding of the
relationship between space and intensively variable quantity is going to
be achieved. Then the author short-circuits any such understanding via the
simplifying assumption that omits the distinction between covariant and
contravariant functors as "unwieldy". As final display of the mastery of
expositional technique, the categorical object which has, for nearly
twenty pages, been heralded as simple, is revealed in the final pages in
the most complicated and unexplained form possible. (Totally passed over
is the issue that had led Grothendieck to the considerations allegedly
being treated: not only the category of affine schemes, but also the
category of all its presheaves, where the author implicitly wants us to
work, fails to have the geometrically correct colimits needed to define
projective space.)
	Another level of attack was launched when Cornell University was
given very large sums of money to develop methods of teaching geometry
without mentioning any geometrical concepts. No proof of the desirability
of such a draconian excising of content needed to be given, beyond some
phrases from the Dalai Lama.
	"Dumbing down" is an attack not only on school children and on
undergraduates, but also one taking measured aim at colleagues in adjacent
fields and at the general public. The general public is thirsty for
genuinely informational articles to replace the science fiction gruel
served constantly by journals like the Scientific American and the New
York Times "Science" section. Those journals have never published anything
resembling a mathematical proof and hence have rarely actually explained
any scientific subject in a usable way. Nor have they even undertaken any
program to raise the level of knowledge of calculus or linear algebra
among their readers in a way which would make such explanations feasible.
Instead, they provide games and amusements to divert the
mathematically-interested public.
	In January of 2005 the Notices of the AMS announced that they had
for a full ten years been strictly following a certain editorial policy.
There had been a widespread demand for expository articles. To that
demand, the response was a new definition of "expository": all precise
definitions of mathematical concepts must be eliminated. Authors of
expository articles were forced to compromise their presentation, or to
withdraw their paper. Mathematicians, who were for several years
becoming aware that these new expository articles are absolutely useless
for developing a mathematical thought, were shocked to learn that a
conscious policy had forced that situation.
	A peculiar sort of anti-authoritarianism seems to be the only
justification offered for degrading the role of definition, theorem, and
proof; certainly, serious expositors have never considered that the use of
those three pillars of geometrical enlightenment excludes explanations and
examples. Others have urged, however, that those instruments be
eliminated even from lectures at meetings and from professional papers.
	That threat is part of the background for the concern expressed in
the many messages to the categories list over the past weeks. Deeply
concerned mathematicians ask me "How can we know?". Indeed, how can we
know whether it is worthwhile to attend a certain meeting or a certain
talk, and how can a scientific committee know whether a proposed talk is
scientifically viable? If the "you don't want to know" culture of no
proofs, no definitions, is accepted, we will truly have no way of knowing,
and will be pressured to fall back on unsupported faith.

I met George Mackey in April 1967 at the British
Mathematical Colloquium in Swansea, where I gave an invited  talk on the
groupoid  van Kampen theorem, and I overheard some people in the common room
saying they were not completely convinced. You win some, you lose some!

But Mackey came up to me at tea and said: `That was very interesting. I have
been using groupoids for years. My name is Mackey.'

He then told me of his work in ergodic theory using `virtual groups'. It
occurred to me that if the groupoid idea can be arrived at from two quite
different directions, then there couild be more in the groupoid idea than
met the eye. It became clear that he used the action groupoid of a group
action, and this convinced me that I should add to my planned book a chapter
on covering spaces and covering groupoids.

For those who are unaware of the idea of a virtual group, Mackey's idea was
that since a transitive action of a group corresponded to a conjugacy class
of subgroups, then an ergodic action (i.e. one where the orbits are of
measure 0 or 1) should correspond to an analogous concept. His exposition
went through various phases, including a cocycle formulation, and eventually
involved the measured groupoid corresponding to an ergodic action. This
work, and that of his students, such as Arlan Ramsay, has been a foundation,
as I understand it, for much work on  the C^*-algebras of measured
groupoids.

We met a few more times, and he was always most friendly and genuine.

When I went to Bangor, Tony Seda came there from Warwick in order to help
his mother who was ill and lived in Llandudno. His  MSc project had been in
measure theory. So we agreed he should look at Mackey's work. In the end he
developed Haar measure in this area, and when I told Mackey he said *his*
student was doing the same! Tony's excellent papers in this area have
perhaps not been as well noticed  as they should, so Tony in the end moved
into theoretical computer science.

So my conclusion is that George Mackey was a great pioneer in structural
ideas in mathematics, with a broad range of interests, and a really nice
guy.

This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 227)
John Baez

[stuff about physics deleted]

I had a great time in Marseille.  The area around there is great for
mathematicians.  Algebraists can visit the beautiful nearby city of
Aix - pronounced "x".  Logicians will enjoy the dry, dusty island of
If - pronounced "eef", just like a French logician would say it.
And everyone will enjoy the medieval hill town of Les Baux, which looks
like something out of Escher.

Actually the Chateau D'If, on the island of the same name, is where
Edmond Dantes was imprisoned in Alexander Dumas' novel "The Count of
Monte Cristo".  It's in this formidable fortress that the wise old
Abbe Faria tells Dantes the location of the treasure that later made
him rich.

I guess everyone except me read this story as a kid - I'm just reading
it now.  But how many of you remember that Faria spent his time in
prison studying the works of Aristotle?  There's a great scene where
Dantes asks Faria where he learned so much about logic, and Faria replies:
"If - and only If!"

That Dumas guy sure was a joker.

Luckily I didn't need to be locked up on a deserted island to learn
some logic in Marseille.  There were lots of great talks on this topic
at the conference I attended:

7) Geometry of Computation 2006 (Geocal06), http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/geocal06/

For example, Yves Lafont gave a category-theoretic approach to Boolean
logic gates which explains their relation to Feynman diagrams:

8) Yves Lafont, Towards an algebraic theory of Boolean circuits,
Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 184 (2003), 257-310.  Also
available at http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~lafont/publications.html

and together with Yves Guiraud, Francois Metayer and Albert Burroni,
he gave a detailed introduction to the homology of n-categories and
its application to rewrite rules.  The idea is to study any sort of
algebraic gadget (like a group) by creating an n-category where the
objects are "expressions" for elements in the gadget, the morphisms
are "ways of rewriting expressions" by applying the rules at hand,
the 2-morphisms are "ways of passing from one way of rewriting
expressions to another" by applying certain "meta-rules", and so on.
Then one can use ideas from algebraic topology to study this
n-category and prove stuff about the original gadget!

To understand how this actually works, it's best to start with Craig
Squier's work on the word problem for monoids.  I explained this
pretty carefully back in "week70" when I first heard Lafont lecture
on this topic - it made a big impression on me!  You can read more here:

monoids, Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, Cambridge U.
Press, 1991, pp. 297-326.  Also available at

complete rewriting systems (after Craig C. Squier), Journal of Pure and
Applied Algebra 98 (1995), 229-244.  Also available at

Then you can go on to the higher-dimensional stuff:

to equational logic, Theor. Comput. Sci. 115 (1993), 43-62.

and Applied Logic (in press).  Also available at

Applications of Categories 11 (2003), 148-184.  Available online
at http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/11/7/11-07abs.html

I was also lucky to get some personal tutoring from folks including
Laurent Regnier, Peter Selinger and especially Phil Scott.  Ever since
"week40", I've been trying to understand something called "linear logic",
which was invented by Jean-Yves Girard, who teaches in Marseille.
Thanks to all this tutoring, I think I finally get it!

To get a taste of what Phil Scott told me, you should read this:

14) Philip J. Scott, Some aspects of categories in computer science,
Handbook of Algebra, Vol. 2, ed. M. Hazewinkel, Elsevier, New York, 2000.
Available as http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~phil/papers/

Right now, I'm only up to explaining a microscopic portion of this
stuff.  But since the typical reader of This Week's Finds may know more
about physics than logic, maybe that's good.  In fact, I'll use this
as an excuse to simplify everything tremendously, leaving out all sorts
of details that a real logician would want.

Logic can be divided into two parts: SYNTAX and SEMANTICS.  Roughly
speaking, syntax concerns the symbols you scribble on the page,
while semantics concerns what these symbols mean.

A bit more precisely, imagine some kind of logical system where you
write down some theory - like the axioms for a group, say - and use
it to prove theorems.

In the realm of syntax, we focus on the form our theory is allowed
to have, and how we can deduce new sentences from old ones.  So, one
of the key concepts is that of a PROOF.  The details will vary depending
on the kind of logical system we're studying.

In the realm of semantics, we are interested in gadgets that actually
satisfy the axioms in our theory - for example, actual groups, if we're
thinking about the theory of groups.  Such a gadget is called a MODEL
of the theory.  Again, the details vary immensely.

In the realm of syntax, we say a list of axioms X "implies" a sentence
P if we can prove P from X using some deduction rules, and we write this
as

X |- P

In the realm of semantics, we say a list of axioms X "entails" a sentence
P if every model of X is also a model of P, and we write this as

X |= P

Syntax and semantics are "dual" in a certain sense - a sense that can
be made very precise if one fixes a specific class of logical systems.
This duality is akin to the usual relation between vector spaces and
their duals, or more generally groups and their categories of
representations.  The idea is that given a theory T you can figure
out its models, which form a category Mod(T) - and conversely, given the
category of models Mod(T), perhaps with a little extra information,
you can reconstruct T.

A little extra information?  Well, in some cases a model of T will be
a *set* with some extra structure - for example, if T is the theory of
groups, a model of T will be a group, which is a set equipped with some
operations.  So, in these cases there's a functor

U: Mod(T) -> Set

assigning each model its underlying set.  And, you can easily reconstruct T
from Mod(T) *together* with this functor.

This idea was worked out by Lawvere for a class of logical systems
called algebraic theories, which I discussed in "week200".   But, the
same idea goes by the name of "Tannaka-Krein duality" in a different
context: a Hopf algebra H has a category of comodules Rep(H), which
comes equipped with a functor

U: Rep(H) -> Vect

assigning each comodule its underlying vector space.  And, you can
reconstruct H from Rep(H) together with this functor.  The proof is
even very similar to Lawvere's proof for algebraic theories!

I gave a bunch of talks in Marseille about algebraic theories, some
related logical systems called PROPs and PROs, and their relation to
quantum theory, especially Feynman diagrams:

14) John Baez, Universal algebra and diagrammatic reasoning, available
as http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/universal/

I came mighty close to explaining how to compute the cohomology of
an algebraic theory... and you can read more about that here:

15) Mauka Jibladze and Teimuraz Pirashvili, Cohomology of algebraic
theories, J. Algebra 137 (1991) 253-296.

Mauka Jibladze and Teimuraz Pirashvili, Quillen cohomology and
Baues-Wirsching cohomology of algebraic theories, Max-Planck-Institut
fuer Mathematik, preprint series 86 (2005).

But alas, I didn't get around to talking about the duality between
syntax and semantics.  For that Lawvere's original thesis is a good
place to go:

16) F. William Lawvere, Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories,
Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University, 1963.  Also available at
http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/5/tr5abs.html

Anyway, the stuff Phil Scott told me about was mainly over on the
syntax side.  Here categories show up in another way.  Oversimplifying
as usual, the idea is to create a category where an object P is a
*sentence* - or maybe a list of sentences - and a morphism

f: P -> Q

is a *proof* of Q from P - or maybe an equivalence class of proofs.

We can compose proofs in a more or less obvious way, so with any
luck this gives a category!  And, different kinds of logical system
give us different kinds of categories.

Quite famously, intuitionistic logic gives cartesian closed categories.
The "multiplicative fragment" of linear logic gives *-autonomous categories.
And, full-fledged linear logic gives us certain fancier kinds of categories.
If you want to learn about these examples, read the handbook article by
Phil Scott mentioned above.

One thing that intrigues me is the equivalence relation we need to get
a category whose morphisms are equivalence classes of proofs.  In
Gentzen's "natural deduction" approach to logic, there are various
deduction rules.  Here's one:

P |- Q    P |- Q'
------------------
  P |- Q & Q'

This says that if P implies Q and it also implies Q', then it implies
Q & Q'.

Here's another:

P |- Q => R
------------
P and Q |- R

And here's a very important one, called the "cut rule":

P |- Q    Q |- R
-----------------
     P |- R

If P implies Q and Q implies R, then P implies R!

There are a bunch more... and to get the game rolling we need
to start with this:

P |- P

In this setup, a proof f: P -> Q looks vaguely like this:

    f-crud
    f-crud
    f-crud
    f-crud
    f-crud
    f-crud
 -------------
    P |- Q

The stuff I'm calling "f-crud" is a bunch of steps which use the
deduction rules to get to P |- Q.

Suppose we also we also have a proof

g: Q -> R

There's a way to stick f and g together to get a proof

fg: P -> R

This proof consists of setting the proofs f and g side by side and then
using the cut rule to finish the job.  So, fg looks like this:

     f-crud     g-crud
     f-crud     g-crud
     f-crud     g-crud
     f-crud     g-crud
    --------   --------
     P |- Q     Q |- R
   ---------------------
           P |- R

Now let's see if composition is associative.  Suppose we also have a
proof

h: R -> S

We can form proofs

(fg)h: P -> S

and

f(gh): P -> S

Are they equal?  No!  The first one looks like this:


     f-crud     g-crud
     f-crud     g-crud
     f-crud     g-crud       h-crud
     f-crud     g-crud       h-crud
    --------   --------      h-crud
     P |- Q     Q |- R       h-crud
   ---------------------   -----------
           P |- R            R |- S
         ----------------------------
                    P |- S


while the second one looks like this:


                g-crud       h-crud
                g-crud       h-crud
    f-crud      g-crud       h-crud
    f-crud      g-crud       h-crud
    f-crud     --------     --------
    f-crud      Q |- R       R |- S
   ---------   ---------------------
    P |- Q            Q |- S
   ----------------------------
            P |- S


So, they're not quite equal!  This is one reason we need an
equivalence relation on proofs to get a category.  Both proofs
resemble trees, but the first looks more like this:

\  /  /
 \/  /
  \ /
   |

while the second looks more like this:

\  \  /
 \  \/
  \ /
   |

So, we need an equivalence relation that identifies these proofs
if we want composition to be associative!

This sort of idea, including this "tree" business, is very familiar
from homotopy theory, where we need a similar equivalence relation if we
want composition of paths to be associative.  But in homotopy theory,
people have learned that it's often better NOT to impose an equivalence
relation on paths!  Instead, it's better to form a *weak 2-category* of paths,
where there's a 2-morphism going from this sort of composite:

\  /  /
 \/  /
  \ /
   |

to this one:

\  \  /
 \  \/
  \ /
   |

This is called the "associator".  In our logic context, we can think of
the associator as a way to transform one proof into another.

The associator should satisfy an equation called the "pentagon identity",
which I explained back in "week144".  However, it will only do this if
we let 2-morphisms be *equivalence classes* of proof transformations.

So, there's a kind of infinite regress here.  To deal with this, it
would be best to work with a "weak omega-category" with

sentences (or sequences of sentences) as objects,
proofs as morphisms,
proof transformations as 2-morphisms,
transformations of proof transformations as 3-morphisms,...

and so on.   With this, we would never need any equivalence relations:
we keep track of all transformations explicitly.  This is almost beyond
what mathematicians are capable of at present, but it's clearly a good
thing to strive toward.

So far, it seems Seely has gone the furthest in this direction.
In his thesis, way back in 1977, he studied what one might call "weak
cartesian closed 2-categories" arising from proof theory.  You can read
an account of this work here:

17) R.A.G. Seely, Weak adjointness in proof theory, in Proc. Durham Conf.
on Applications of Sheaves, Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics 753,
Springer, Berlin, 1979, pp. 697-701.  Also available at
http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/WkAdj/adj.pdf

Proc. Symposium on Logic in Computer Science 1987, Computer Society
of the IEEE, pp. 65-71.  Also available at
http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/WkAdj/LICS.pdf

Can we go all the way and cook up some sort of omega-category of proofs?
Interestingly, while the logicians at Geocal06 were talking about
n-categories and the geometry of proofs, the mathematician Vladimir
Voevodsky was giving some talks at Stanford about something that sounds
pretty similar:

18) Vladimir Voevodsky, lectures on homotopy lambda calculus,
notice at http://math.stanford.edu/distinguished_voevodsky.htm

Voevodsky has thought hard about n-categories, and he won the
Fields medal for his applications of homotopy theory to algebraic
geometry.

The typed lambda calculus is another way of thinking about intuitionistic
logic - or in other words, cartesian closed categories of proofs.  The
"homotopy lambda calculus" should thus be something similar, but where
we keep track of transformations between proofs, transformations
between transformations between proofs... and so on ad infinitum.

But that's just my guess!  Is this what Voevodsky is talking about???
I haven't managed to get anyone to tell me.  Maybe I'll email him and ask.

There were a lot of other cool talks at Geocal06, like Girard's talk
on applications of von Neumann algebras (especially the hyperfinite
type II_1 factor!) in logic, and Peter Selinger's talk on the category of
completely positive maps, diagrammatic methods for dealing with these
maps, and their applications to quantum logic:

19) Peter Selinger, Dagger compact closed categories and completely
positive maps, available at http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers.html

But, I want to finish writing this and go out and have some waffles
for my Sunday brunch.  So, I'll stop here!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Addendum: An anonymous correspondent had this to say about the
"homotopy lambda calculus":

  Several years ago, Kontsevich explained to me an idea he had about
 "homotopy proof theory" (or model theory, or logic, ...).  As soon as I
  saw Voevodsky's abstract it reminded me of what Kontsevich said; perhaps
  it's a well-known idea in the Russian-Fields-medallist club.  Somewhere
  I have notes from what Kontsevich said, but as far as I remember it went
  roughly like this.

  In certain set-ups (such as Martin-Lof type theory) every statement
  carries a proof of itself.  Of course, a statement may have many proofs.
  If we imagine that all the statements are of the form "A = B", then what
  we're saying is that every equals sign carries with it a *reason* for
  equality, or proof of equality.  If I remember rightly, Kontsevich's
  idea was to do a topological analogue, so that every term (like A and B)
  is assigned a point in some fixed space, and equalities of terms induce
  paths between points.  There was more, pushing the idea further, but I
  forget what.

	Down with "Foundations"! Up with algebra!

Dear Friends,

Presumably I am among those who are being "vilified" as "lovers of
categories as foundation". By avoiding any precise definition, such
a formulation might appeal to the widespread justified boredom induced by
the past hundred years of "foundations as justification".

	Whenever I used the word "foundation" in my writings over the past
forty years, I have explicitly rejected that reactionary use of the term
and instead used the definition implicit in the work of my teachers
Truesdell and Eilenberg. Namely, an important component of mathematical
practice is the careful study of historical and contemporary analysis,
geometry, etc. to extract the essential recurring concepts and
constructions; making those concepts and constructions (such as
homomorphism, functional, adjoint functor, etc.) explicit provides
powerful guidance for further unified development of all mathematical
subjects, old and new.

	What is the primary tool for such summing up of the essence of
ongoing mathematics? Algebra! Nodal points in the progress of this kind of
research occur when, as is the case with the finite number of axioms for
the metacategory of categories, all that we know so far can be expressed
in a single sort of algebra. I am proud to have participated with
Eilenberg, Mac Lane, Freyd, and many others, in bringing about the
contemporary awareness of

			Algebra as Category Theory

	Had it not been for the century of excessive attention
given to the alleged possibility that mathematics is inconsistent, with
the accompanying degradation of the F-word, we would still be using it in
the sense known to the general public: the search for what is "basic". We,
who supposedly know the explicit algebra of homomorphisms, functionals,
etc. are long remiss in our duty to find ways to utilize those concepts
also in guiding high school calculus.

	Best wishes, Bill

Reuben Hersh, cited in Eugenia Cheng's fascinating paper "Mathematics,
Morally," put it succinctly in 1991.

"There is an amazingly high consensus in mathematics as to what is
'correct' or 'accepted'."

It's really too bad we can't go back and show those old-timers what
their stuff has evolved into.  Most of it would presumably evoke the
ancient counterpart of "Wow," but that's boringly predictable.  What
would really be interesting would be the less predictable reactions of
the form "I knew that but didn't write it down because...".

For example the basic concept of a model must surely have occurred to
many over the millennia but seemed pointless formulating as a
mathematical concept in its own right, perhaps for want of the concept
of any alternative model to that one, perhaps for want of a suitable
framework, perhaps because everyone else seemed to be taking it for
granted as part of the ambient logic so why should I rock that boat?

One can see this in the late Robert Floyd's seminal 1967 paper
"Assigning meanings to programs" on the verification of imperative
programs, where he clearly has some model of his axioms in mind in his
completeness proof for his axiomatization of assignment x:=e (the dual
of Hoare's subsequent axiomatization), yet it does not occur to him to
say what the model is.  In my 1976 paper "Semantical considerations on
Floyd-Hoare logic" I made explicit the model Floyd apparently had in
mind in his proof by defining it to be a Kripke structure (of the kind
introduced by Kripke in "Semantical considerations on modal logic"),
showed that Floyd's informal completeness argument worked just fine when
formalized for that model (so Floyd was morally correct), and extended
it to a complete Floyd-style axiomatization of array assignment (whose
completeness is complicated by the possibility of aliasing as in
a[a[i]]:=a[a[j]]).  (The paper then went on to define modal dynamic
logic, which I put at the end as merely a syntactic sidebar of marginal
interest; unexpectedly it caught people's fancy and appears to have
settled down as a staple of linguistic theory.)  I believe this was the
first application of model theoretic methods to the verification of
programs containing assignment statements, the kind of program forming
the mainstream of programming languages.  (Functional programming in
contrast was designed from the outset to support semantics, whence its
popularity with logicians.)  It certainly was the first to use Kripke
structures for that purpose, which today are the standard model for
imperative programming.  The paper cites and treats a number of
references to prior applications of modal logic to programming, none of
which however offered a semantics, seemingly having such a semantics
only in the back of their mind as with Floyd.  This neglect of semantics
continues even today: most programmers, along with their managers,
remain oblivious to the important backroom role of semantics in the
verification of their programs, to the extent of being unaware even of
its existence.

A basic reason for not writing down what one is thinking is lack of
awareness of one's thought processes.  Another is want of a suitable
framework for formulating those thoughts in a way other than as what
later mathematicians would judge as handwaving.  Yet another is the
difficulty, even today, of separating mathematics from religion, defined
as matters of faith.  The irrationality of the diagonal of the unit
square was at one point unthinkable, giving us no way of knowing for how
many centuries it was a dark secret of certain mathematical cults
bordering on heresy or worse.  Today's mathematical religions have
shifted their attention away from existence, where nowadays everything
goes (though Robinson-style infinitesimals are a tiny pill that some
find hard to swallow), instead focusing on relevance, utility, and other
subjective criteria for acceptance.

Foundations reared its head in the 19th C, forcing mathematicians to
hold up their intuitions to the bright lights and microscopes of logic.
  This process is somewhat akin to fashion designers being asked to
appraise the apparel of their emperor.  Once a consensus has built, even
if artificially as necessary for underdressed emperors, it becomes very
hard to stick to your guns.  This phenomenon makes it impossible to
tell, post-Cantor, whether those intuitions were more set theoretical or
category theoretical in nature.  Answers to that must be sought in
pre-Cantorian mathematics.

My personal belief is that when the pathways of the human brain are
finally unravelled and understood, they will be shown to be based on
Yoneda, not as a lemma however but as an axiom postulating a certain
dense embedding.  In the millions of years of evolution of primate
thinking, no productive mathematical mechanism has a higher probability
of being stumbled on than mathematics founded on the Yoneda axiom.  I
know of no better explanation of how human thought could have evolved to
its present form than evolution finding and exploiting the Yoneda
principle, that (for example) the unique 2-element semigroup whose
Cayley table has distinct constant columns can generate every graph and
graph homomorphism in a simple, uniform, and economical way.  The
likelihood of evolution stumbling on a serviceable fragment of Zermelo's
axioms other than by our conscious thought seems considerably lower.  If
evolution discovered both, chances are it found Yoneda first.  Yoneda
needs so much less neural machinery than any of its competitors.

Yet even today Google has not stumbled on the Yoneda axiom (as a
phrase).  I put that down to the mechanism being such a fundamental part
of how we think that we have no more mental access to it than we have
physical access to quarks.  Proof that our brains incorporate the Yoneda
axiom will have to await more advanced technology, until then that model
of the evolution of human thought will remain a conceit of the cracks
and pots promoting it.

Idempotent monads correspond to full reflective subcategories; so the only
examples are induced by full reflective subcategories of finite
categories.

I just returned from a vacation and caught up with this thread, so
please bear with me as I back up to the central question posed by
Marta Bunge. She suggested that

Is there any evidence to support this claim? I.e., actual examples
where such research was disproportionally supported that was
uncritical and perhaps unwarranted? There have been several posts
seemingly agreeing that this is the case, but none have given concrete
evidence.  I feel that it is necessary to establish that such
practices indeed exist, before discussing what, if anything, needs to
be done about it. Can one rule out another possibility, namely that
such research is supported because it is original, timely, and
interesting?

i think david yetter's analysis of the dichotomy "categories as =20
foundations" vs "categories as algebra" was spot on ---  with respect =20=

to people and the community. indeed, one could split most of our =20
papers into one category or the other.

but at the end of the day, i think, we'll all agree that the source =20
of the unreasonable effectiveness of categorical algebra is its =20
foundational content (although there is probably a lot of it that we =20
dont understand yet); and the other way around. eg, if you look at =20
grothendieck's work, he started working in algebra, and ended up =20
developing foundational structures, because he needed them. and a lot =20=

on the "algebra" side now is built upon them. ok, then for a while it =20=

was thought that he exaggerated with foundations, and that a more =20
direct approach "could have been in better taste" (to cite =20
eilenberg). but maby the fermat theorem would have a more useful =20
proof if it was developed in grothendieck style. and nowadays, there =20
is a lot of foundational content in tannaka duality etc, in TQFT in =20
general, but we only see hints of it at the moment (and i for one =20
just see the reflections of these hints in other people's eyes).

i am of course saying things very clear and familiar to many people =20
on this list, but maby they are worth saying nevertheless. it might =20
be good if the links between "categories as algebras" and "categories =20=

as foundations" would not boil down just to the greatest of the =20
category theorists, leaving the rest of us in two camps.

a math proof is hardly necessary to explain a scientific subject in a

now for a mathematical subject a math proof is sometimes but not always
necessary

depends what you mean by that

developing a sense of what the thought of the experts are so that one

Examples ? I certinaly have not seen such
In fact as an editor and referee and all the referees I've used
have never tolerated such elimination.  in fact, due to cross

WHY ARE WE CONCERNED? II

Misconceptions

	The question is not whether mathematics should be applied. Most of
us agree that it should. The concern is rather that our subject is
sometimes being used as a mystifying smoke screen to protect
pseudo-applications against the scrutiny of the general public and of the
scientific colleagues in adjacent disciplines. We need to ensure that
applications themselves be maximally effective, not clouded by
misunderstanding.

	Some of the most important applications of our unifying efforts as
categorists have been to the
	teaching of algebraic topology
	teaching of algebraic geometry
	teaching of logic and set theory
	teaching of differential geometry
These subjects all arose from the efforts to clarify and apply calculus;
thus some of us have applied category theory to the teaching of calculus.

	But it seems that we have not taught category theory itself well
enough. Several recent writings reveal that basic misunderstandings about
category theory are still prevalent, even among people who use it. Some of
these concern the myth that category theory is the "insubstantial part" of
mathematics and that it heralds an era when precise axioms are no longer
needed. (Other myths revolve around the false belief that there are "size
problems" if one tries to do category theory in a way harmonious with the
standard practice of professional set theorists; see next posting.) The
first of these misunderstandings is connected with taking seriously the
jest "sets without elements". The traditions of algebraic geometry and of
category theory are completely compatible about elements, as I now show.

	Contrary to Fregean rigidity, in mathematics we never use
"properties" that are defined on the universe of "everything". There is
the "universe of discourse" principle which is very important: for
example, any given group, (or any given topological space, etc.) acts as a
universe of discourse. As these examples suggest, a universe of discourse
typically carries a structure which permits interesting properties and
constructions on it. As the examples also show, there are typically many
objects of a given mathematical category and also many categories, so
transformation is an essential part of the content. As quantity includes
zero, so structure includes the case of no structure, which Cantor
considered one of his most profound and exciting discoveries. (His
conjecture that the continuum hypothesis holds in that realm is probably
true. [Bulletin of Symbolic Logic 9 (2003) 213-223].) Dedekind, Hausdorff,
and most of 20th century mathematics followed the paradigm whereby
structures have two aspects, a theory and an interpretation of it in such
a featureless background. Because the background thus contributes minimal
distortion to the assumptions of the theory, the completeness theorems of
first-order logic, the Nullstellensatz, and related results are available.
The more geometric background categories which receive models are also
viewed as structures (of an opposite kind) in abstract sets, for example
the classifying topos for local rings as a background for algebraic
groups. Such is "set theory" in the practice of mathematics; it is part
of the essence from which organization emerges.

	By contrast, the "set theory" studied by 20th century set
theorists has a different aim and architecture. The aim is "justification"
of mathematics, and the architecture is that of the cumulative hierarchy.
The alleged need for justification arose in connection with the re-naming
of Cantor's theorem as "Russell's paradox"; Cantor's theorem had shown
that the system proposed by Frege was inconsistent, but there were those
who dreamed nonetheless of restoring that rigidity. There was a bitter
controversy between Cantor and Frege, and Zermelo swore allegiance to
Frege [Cantor G.: Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts,
1966, page 441, remarks of Zermelo on Cantor's 1884 review of Frege]. Von
Neumann based himself on Zermelo and made explicit the cumulative
hierarchy, which Bernays and Goedel used and which many subsequent set
theorists presumed was the only architecture to be studied. The
justificational aspect stems from the supposed construction of the
hierarchy by a bizarre parody of ordinary iteration, parameterized by
infinite ordinal numbers (Cantor's third discovery), entities which from
the point of view of ordinary mathematics are even more in need of
justification than the analysis that supposedly needed it. (Indeed, in
attempting to describe what these alleged infinite ordinals are and do,
people often resort to stories about gods and demons.) Little or no
progress has been made on this "justification" problem in a century, but
work with the hierarchy has produced some knowledge about the
possibilities for categories of sets. By adopting a standard definition of
map and discarding the mock iteration (with its concomitant complicated
structure), each model of the cumulative hierarchy yields a category of
abstract nearly featureless sets; most of the usual set-theoretical issues
depend only on the mere category: measurable cardinals,
Goedel-constructibility, the continuum hypothesis, etc.

	Having thus briefly understood the two visions which are called
set theory

(1) a category of Cantorian featureless sets which serves as the
background recipient for the structures of algebra, geometry and analysis;

(2) the cumulative hierarchy with its rigid Fregean structure aiming to
justify mathematics,

it is not surprising that the precise nature of the elementhood relations
appropriate to each are quite different. While the Fregean image involves
rigid inclusion and elementhood relations imagined to be given once and
for all for mathematics as a whole, the usual mathematical practice
instead considers inclusion and membership relations for subsets of a
given universe of discourse (such as R^3). Thanks to Grothendieck's Tohoku
observation, these mathematical local belonging relations are well
globalized within the notion of category, whose primitives are domain,
codomain, identity, and composition.

[The notion of category is a simple first-order theory of a semi-algebraic
kind. It has myriads of interpretations, some in "classes", some "locally
small" etc., but such undefined restrictions on interpretations have
nothing to do with the notion of category per se. Many properties are best
expressed within the first-order theory itself.]

	Composition is a kind of non-commutative multiplication, hence
there are two kinds of division problems. In any category, given any two
morphisms a and b we can ask whether there exists a morphism p such that
a = bp; if so, we may say that a belongs to b. This forces a and b to have
as codomain the same object, which serves as their common universe of
discourse. (The dual relation, f determines g, defined by "there exists m
with mf = g", is probably equally important in mathematics.) There are two
special cases of this belonging relation which are of special interest.
First we say that b is a part (or subset in the case of a category of
sets) of its codomain, if for all a belonging to b, the proof p of that
belonging is unique; this is immediately seen to be equivalent to the
usual notion of monomorphism. Then, if a and b are parts of the same
object, we say a included in b iff a belongs to b. Any arbitrary morphism
x with codomain X may be considered an element of X in the sense of
Volterra (also known as a figure in X); we say that x is a member of b iff
x belongs to b. Then clearly

 a is included in b iff for all x, if x is a member of a, then x is a
member of b.

The usual relationship between these two relations is thus maintained.
Because in category theory the domain relation is as important as the
codomain relation, we can be more precise about elements: very often it is
appropriate to consider a special property of objects, and restrict the
term element (or figure) to elements whose domain has that property, that
is, to figures whose shape has the property. For example, in algebraic
geometry the connected separable objects are appropriate domains for the
figures known as "points"; in the algebraically closed case it suffices to
consider elements with domain a terminal object 1 as points. On the other
hand, frequently it is of interest to choose a small class of figure
shapes which generates in the sense of Grothendieck, i.e. so that the
above equivalence between inclusion and universal implication of
memberships holds even when the figures x are restricted to those of the
prescribed shapes. A basic property of categories of Cantorian sets is
that this holds with x restricted to those with terminal domain 1. In
algebraic geometry, the figures whose domains have trivial cohomology are
adequate. Note that if f is a morphism from A to B and if x is an element
of A, then fx is an element of B of the same shape (of course in general
figures are singular in that they distort their shape, for example, fx may
be more singular than the figure x). Properties of x in A may be quite
different from the properies of fx in B.

	The mysterious distinction between x and singleton(x) in the
hierarchical Frege architecture takes quite a different form in the
categorical architecture where there is a natural transformation from the
identity functor to the covariant power set functor; this natural
transformation can be called singleton: singleton(x) is simply x
considered as a special element of PX, rather than of the original X.

	Professors may not consider the possibility of learning from
undergraduate text books, and some may feel bored that I have once again
repeated the above basic definitions and observations. But if these basics
were widely understood among algebraic geometers, perhaps misconceptions
like "category theory is the insubstantial part of mathematics" would not
have arisen. (As we know from experience, all of the substance of
mathematics can be fully expressed in categories.) Perhaps the general
term "A-points" for arbitrary rings A was confusing. "Spec(A)-shaped
figures" is a more accurate rendering of Volterra's "elements"; that could
be abbreviated to "A-figures", but points are in some sense special among
figures. On the other hand, we often vary the background category, so that
alternative terminology might involve passing from a category E to
E/spec(A), and restricting the notion of "point" in any category to mean
figure of terminal shape; then the A-figures become, on pulling back to
the new category, literally "moving points".

	Whatever the particular chosen terminology, the important
conclusion is to actively eliminate the mythology that spaces in
categories have no elements, because as we see, this mythology obscures
the simplicity of certain matters and thus provides a bogus basis for
insulating one field of mathematics from another.

	[The belonging relation is just the poset collapse of
the categories E/X, whose actual maps serve as incidence relations,
especially between figures in X. Thus every category E supports a certain
geometrical imagery wherein all maps are geometrically continuous, in that
they map figures to figures without tearing the incidence relations.
Precise axioms about E are a key to further progress because they
explicitly sum up and guide our experience with the objects and maps in
E.]

Thanks, Jim, for pointing this out. The concern expressed by Sir Edwin
Southern is in the minds of many. For example Pierre Cartier has asked
"where are the youth? "  Indeed, if they submit to a culture that
emphasizes carrer above content, how can our children become serious
scientists?

It would seem appropriate for me to write something on Jon's
mathematics.  His career can be divided into three parts.  The first was
on (co)homology theories, (co)triples, and resolutions and is really the
only one I understand.  The second was on things related to H-spaces and
there were only two published papers [LNM #88, 139--153 and LNM #196,
54--62].  One thing I know he claimed (and never got credit for) was
that an A_\infty space is homotopic (or maybe weakly homotopic) to a
topological monoid.  Since I never really understood this work, I will
leave it to others to comment on.  The third was his attempt to apply
homotopy theory to understand the operations of a finite calculator.
This was evidently an outgrowth of the second, since the operations of a
finite calculator are not associative, but perhaps more like an A_\infty
space.  Since that work was not perfected, I will say no more about it.

Jon's thesis has many things in it, but here are the parts I remember
best.  One of the most ingenious was the idea of a Beck module.  He
observed that if *C* is a category and C an object, then the category
Ab(*C*/C), the abelian group objects in the category of objects over C
is defined to be the category of C-modules.  Here is what that amounts
to in specific cases:  Groups, left C-modules; rings, C-bimodules;
commutative rings, left C-modules; Lie algebras, left C-modules.  It is
apparent that in each case (including that of commutative algebras whose
cohomology theory appeared only in 1962 and Jon did not know of until
later), these Beck modules are exactly the modules used as coefficients
in the cohomology theories.  It also turns out that if C' --> C is an
object over C, and M is a C-module, then Hom(C',M) in the category *C*/C
can be identified in all those cases as the group Der(C',M) of
derivations.  I think that this brilliant observation alone would have
deserved a PhD, but it was only one chapter (of five) in Jon's thesis.

Given a cotriples \G on the category *C*, define a resolution of an
object C as the simplicial object
      --->      --->
   ... ..  G^3C  ..  G^2C ===> GC
      --->      --->
(This is an awful medium to do this in.  You also have to imagine
degeneracies.)  and the cohomology H^.(C,M) as the cohomology groups of
the chain complex
  0 ---> Der(GC,M) ---> Der(G^2C,M) ---> Der(G^3C,M) ---> ...
Jon proved that H^0(C,M) = Der(C,M) and that H^1(C,M) could be
interpretated as the group of "singular extensions" (he had to find the
appropriate definitions of that too) of C with kernel M. These
definitions are thus, in low dimensions, closely related to the
classical cohomology groups modulo the usual shift in dimensions.  He
also defined what you might call the inhomogenous chain complex that
used the triple in the underlying category to define the same groups.
Along the way, he also proved the PTT, the theorem that characterizes
the category of Eilenberg-Moore algebras for a triple.  Although all
this was available in a draft dated 1964, the final version was
completed only in 1967.  Fortunately, the thesis is now available as a
TAC reprint.  Until that reprint, the only source were various
n-generation photocopies that were being passed hand to hand.

I spent the two years 1962-64 at Columbia, but I don't recall that I had
much contact with Jon until the spring term of 1964.  And even then,
Sammy ordered me to keep away from Jon because he wanted him to write up
his thesis.  But we talked about showing that the higher dimensional
groups he had defined were the same as the higher dimensional groups
that had been defined originally.  We had no handle on the question.
This discussion continued through the fall of 1964 when we had both
moved to Urbana.  The two resolutions looked so different that we just
could not see any way to procede.  In mid-December, we both went east
for the vacation, Jon to NY and me to Philadelphia and eventually also
in NY.  One day, I ran into Jon absolutely accidentally at the Times
Square subway station, if you can imagine, and Jon asked me if I had ever
heard of acyclic models.  I hadn't.  Jon had spoken to Harry Appelgate,
another Eilenberg student, who was writing a thesis on a categorical
version of acyclic models.  When we got back to Urbana, we looked at
acyclic models a la Appelgate.  As I recall it, Appelgate's version used
a Yoneda extension to induce a triple on a functor category.  Since we
were starting with a triple, it turned out to be much simpler for us and
we quickly (well, fairly quickly) carried out the required
verifications.  We both spoke on this at the first midwest category
meeting in Chicago in April of 1965 and Jon spoke on it at the La Jolla
meeting and it appeared in the La Jolla prodeedings [Springer, 336-343].

The final collaboration that Jon and I had was that of using a
simplicial resolution, not derived from a cotriple, to define cohomology
and derived functors.  This was a long paper in LNM #80 (informally
called the "Zurich Triples Book") [345--435].  I think we did this after
(but I cannot recall) seeing Michel Andre's "step-by-step" resolution
for the particular case of commutative algebras.

One more notable thing he did in that period was discover distributive
laws between triples, since they do not naturally compose [LNM #80,
119-140].  This concept was crucial to my analysis of Shukla cohomology,
which required the original distributive law between multiplication and
addition in rings, moved up to the level of triples.

After that our interests diverged and I leave it to others to comment on
his later work.

Let me just make a comment on the word "triple".  Although Jon never
thought it was a good term he thought that "monad" was at least as bad
and didn't approve of the idea of replacing one poor term by another.  I
went along as a gesture of solidarity, although I don't have any deep
feeling on the subject (although my title TTT is really nice).  In the
end, of course, Mac Lane prevailed.  I once asked Sammy why he gave the
idea such a poor name.  Especially given the care that he and Steenrod
had taken to naming "exact".  His answer was that the concept seemed to
have no importance, so he and John Moore didn't spend any time on it!

i meant that he ended up working on toposes, fibrations, and descent
(as foundational structures). i did not mean that he observed the
grothendieck universes (which are perhaps foundational, but not much
of a structure), as my hasty formulation had suggested to some
people. sorry about the confusion (and about taking bandwidth to
correct it),

Absolutely.  I would add publication date as a factor here.  As an
example, a few decades ago an elementary exposition of the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra would not be expected to include an elementary proof
since the extant proofs were either lengthy arguments or nonelementary
appeals to the minimum modulus principle, properties of holomorphic
functions such as Liouville's theorem, or other results the reader would
be unlikely to be on top of.  The dominant belief was that the only
short proofs were nonelementary ones.

But for an audience aware only that z^i for any nonnegative integer i
maps circles at the origin to i-fold circles of radius r^i at the
origin, an entirely elementary notion, an expositor today would be
morally obligated to include a full proof since there is hardly anything
left to explain.  The polynomial a_d z^d + ... + a_0 maps little circles
to the neighborhood of a_0 and big circles to a loop tending to a very
big d-fold circle of radius a_d r^d, whence the smoothly growing image,
under the polynomial, of a smoothly growing circle is obliged to cross
the origin at some stage.  Still a topological argument, but now an
entirely elementary one.

Except, that is, for the theorem that a loop wound d times around the
hole in the punctured plane cannot be continuously retracted to a point,
which was tacitly smuggled in there.   But that statement is less
intimidating than anything based on holomorphic functions.

This slick proof seems only to have emerged in the past couple of
decades.  It is an interesting commentary on mathematics that it took
this long for people to come up with an argument "for the rest of us."
Maybe some people "knew" it all along, but in that case they were
keeping pretty quiet about it.

That depends on what you mean by explaining a subject. Of course, many
people know what a prime is, and if a journal reports that some larger
(Mersenne) prime has been found, or if the journal contains some nice
pictures of fractals, they may either admire this or ask "so what?" In any
case they do not see what a mathematical result is. I met several people
with an academic education in another field. When I told them that I am a
mathematician, some of them replied: "I always liked maths - except
proofs." If this misconception is so wide-spread among educated people -
at least in Germany, Canada and the United States - I think it is more
important that these people see easy proofs of mathematical results (e.g.
Euclid's proof for the existence of infinitely many primes) than that they
see mysterious mathematical statements, which they don't understand.
Mathematics is thinking rather than computation, and if one does not know
what a proof is, one does not know what mathematics is. So for which
subject do you think that a proof is not necessary?


Greetings
Reinhard

I deliberately overstated the case
presenting accessible proofs should of course be done
and certainly equations should not be eschewed
pace Penrose

but there's more to math than proofs
cf. Reinhard's own reference to *thinking*
i.e. *before* a formal proof is worked out
if we could convey even that

There's a saying about Lefschetz that he "never wrote a valid
proof, and never made a false conjecture". Now it's not an attitude
that want to encourage, but if you have great mathematicians who
are like that (and Lefschetz was not just a good mathematician, but
a great mathematician, without whom a good deal of modern algebraic
geometry would be unimaginable), then this ought to tell us something.

What it tells us is, of course, not easy to formulate: it's an example
that causes severe problems for almost every philosophy of mathematics
that I know. But it ought to stop us saying things of the form
"if we don't do category theory in such and such a way, then it
won't be mathematics at all".

(Of course we'll all keep saying this, because we all have a secret
fear that, if we aren't really careful about what we do, the grown up
mathematicians will kick sand in our face, but that's a
psychological problem and not a mathematical problem.)

Has it? It seems to me no more than (an explicity homotopy-theoretic
formulation of) the (implicitly homotopy-theoretic) proof via
Rouch\'e's Theorem, which I was taught as an undergraduate (and which
I've taught to undergraduates on many occasions since then).

This proof was used by Pontryagin in the April 1982 issue of "Kvant"
magazine (targeting school-children!):
http://kvant.mccme.ru/1982/04/osnovnaya_teorema_algebry.htm (in
Russian, but pictures should be enough).

I agree with Bill that the prevailing style of expository writing,
especially in newspapers, is often of poor quality. It would be nice
if such articles more often gave a glimpse into the nature of
research, rather than serving, as Bill puts it, entertainment.

However, I disagree on the role of proofs in expository writing.
Clearly, proofs are central in mathematics. But to say that
mathematics is only about proofs is a bit like saying that dentistry
is only about clinical research. Of course, the research is important,
and most of us who have root canals are very glad that it is being
done. However, I would like to believe that mathematics is ultimately
about solving problems that *matter*, and the reason they matter often
has nothing to do with their proofs.

I am of course not advocating replacing proofs by conjecture. I am
only speaking of expository writing, where I believe it is often more
important to explain the results than their proofs. And sometimes, it
can even be justified to give an "approximate" proof, i.e., a proof
idea, or even an "approximate" definition, if it is stated clearly
that there has been some simplification.

The poor state of mathematical exposition is not confined to articles
about mathematics. The following quote, from an ordinary new article
in yesterday's Times, send my logic-circuits spinning:

 French lawmakers, for example, gave preliminary support this month to
 a measure that would require the company to open the iPod to play
 music purchased from any online music service; currently, songs
 purchased from iTunes can be played only on iPods.

 New York Times, 2006/03/29, "Apple vs. Apple in Dispute Over Trademark"

This is of course not a logical contradiction; but I would be very
surprised if it is what the writer really meant to say. Sadly, most
readers probably won't know the difference one way or the other.

No time to write, though.  The paper was ``On H-spaces and infinite
loop spaces''.   The work of his I most liked concerned distributivity
laws and monads, which I only learned about after rediscovering it for
myself while doing multiplicative infinite loop space theory.

In response to Peter Johnstone (and those who responded privately), my
point about the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra was not that this
particular proof (based on the limiting behaviors of small and large
circles) was not known to anyone, but that it had not emerged, instead
being effectively sat on by those in the know, even if not
intentionally.  At this risk of sounding like an Abu Ghraib
interrogator, "who knew?"

My claim is that no extant proof at all, that or any other, was
considered fit for an elementary exposition more than a couple of
decades ago.  If that estimate is right, the 1982 Pontrjagin article
cited by Nikita Danilov would be one of the earliest popular expositions
based on the circles argument, assuming the section containing Fig. 6 is
the relevant one (my Russian is even rustier than my algebra).  I'd be
very interested in seeing an earlier popular account that didn't claim
that every proof necessarily either was long or depended on out-of-scope
material.

As a case in point, just now I checked a relatively recent Brittanica
article on algebra (1987 ed.), which states flatly (p.260a) that "No
elementary algebraic proof of [the FTAlg] exists, and the result is not
proved here."  (Not even "is known" but "exists"; an expository article
should not assume that the reader knows the jargon meaning of this term
as "exists in the literature".)  The authors taking responsibility for
this claim were Garrett Birkhoff, Marshall Hall, Pierre Samuel, Peter
Hilton, and Paul Cohn.  They go into detail to show that z^n = a has n
roots, starting with the geometry of addition and multiplication in the
Argand diagram, so it's not as if their exposition was at too elementary
a level to talk in terms of mapping circles, or that "algebraic" ruled
out simple geometric arguments.

I submit their nonexistence claim as prima facie evidence for my claim
that the very few who knew this argument weren't even letting the likes
of Birkhoff, Hall, etc. in on it, let alone "the rest of us."

The general message in the literature prior to the 1980's seemed to be,
if Gauss couldn't find a simple proof in half a dozen tries, there isn't
one.  If you don't possess the necessary higher maths or the stamina for
an intricate argument, we can't help you with that result, ask us about
solvability of z^n = a.

Good for Pontrjagin for promoting FTAlg to school children!

Dear Bill,

which is very revealing.

I suppose that you cannot (or do not want to) be more explicit.  I do not
know (for the most part) which articles you are referring to.

Hi,

The 93 is because I have by now 92 msages in my cracks and pots file.

I apologize for the length of this posting. It is intended to be a (may=
 be
biased) partial account of the debate, and some comments.


Well, by now the "cracks and pots" debate is establishing itself as, in=
 my
opinion, an interesting and worth-wile event. Congratulations   Marta !=
!

We are learning about:

a) Understand  (for many of us) better what is mathematics, and what is
physics, what is rigor and what is buccaneering, and also what is
bullshit. =20

b) "Something is rotten in the state of category theory community"=20

Pay attention that The Bard does not say "category theory", but he says
"category theory community"

I start from who has made the more refreshing, humorous, down to
earth, honest and intelligent contributions to this debate:

**Vicent Schmitt: that theoretical physics, computer science, phylo., a
mix of those, or whatever? , is used to justify poor "categorical" work
is, in my view, an existing problem. More or less everyone is conscious=
 of
it (come on!...) but so far that has not been publicly debated.**

Yes Vincent!!, you point right to what it is at the center (or very nea=
r
it) the problem raised in Marta=D5s original "cracks and pots" posting!=
=2E And
the "(come on!...)", beautiful !.

Now, talking about rigor, conjectures and proofs:

**Maclane : If a result has not yet been given valid proof, it isn't ye=
t
mathematics. This however does not deny the many preliminary stages of
insight, experiment, speculation or conjecture, which can lead to
mathematics. It states simply that a conjectured result is not yet a
theorem **

It is relevant to compare this with Motl's distinction between physics =
and
mathematics:

**Motl: In physics, we propose different conjectures about the real wor=
ld,
and it is important that we're not guaranteed that these conjectures wi=
ll
be true.

String theory itself is not just a conjecture, but rather a
seemingly consistent mathematical framework. Once we accept string theo=
ry
as an objectively existing mathematical structure, a structure that we
treat as a part of "generalized physics" - which is of course what all
string theorists are doing every day - we can ask a lot of questions ab=
out
its properties.**

He does distinguish between  "physics as conjecture" and mathematics wi=
th
applications to physics. He call this mathematics  "generalized physics=
"

But "conjecture" to be acceptable is not unrigourous neither buccaneeri=
ng.
he says:

**Motl: the statements about string theory are just conjectures, and th=
ey
need to be proved or supported by evidence, otherwise they're irrelevan=
t
and "wrong", in the physical sense.**

He also says:

** Motl: I always feel very uneasy if the mathematically oriented
people present their conjectures about physics, quantum gravity, or str=
ing
theory as some sort of "obvious facts".

He is clearly saying that those "mathematically oriented people" are
lacking  rigor.=20

Many postings in this debate confound mathematical rigor with formalism=
,
and push forward the idea that a formal and logically correct statement
has automatically rigor. Even if it is foolish:

**V. Pratt: In axiomatic mathematics, everything that is not forbidden =
is
permitted. **

**R. Dawson: If the math itself meets mathematical standards of rigor, =
its
application to physics need surely only meet the standards appropriate =
to
that subject.**

It seems to me that he is equating here "mathematical standards of rigo=
r"
with "logically correct", and  "the standards appropriate to that subje=
ct"
(in this case, physics) with " buccaneering "

Nothing more wrong!! . In both cases, failing to convey what it should =
be
considered  "rigor in mathematics"  and  "rigor in physics"

But again Saunders and Lubos:

**MacLane: real proof is not simply a formalized document, but a sequen=
ce
of ideas and insights**

** Motl: the primary physical motivation is to locate the right ideas a=
nd
equations that describe the real world. Category theory has been used b=
y
many to achieve completely wrong physical conclusions - for example, by
considering the "pompously foolish" quantization functor.**

He however seems to be pushing forward the same misconception of "rigor=
":

**Motl: It may be nice to be rigorous, but it's always more important t=
o
be correct: if the specific kind of rigor leads us to stupid conclusion=
s
in physics, we should avoid it.**

=46rom the original Marta's "cracks and pots"

**M.Bunge:  Are we category theorists as a whole going to quietly accep=
t
getting discredited by a minority of us presumably applying category
theory to string theory?**

**J. Baez: I had never heard anyone before suggest that category theory
could be discredited by applications to string theory. It completely
surprised me.  I'm used to the opposite complaint: that category theory=
 is
discredited by its *lack* of applications.**

Here it is a clear and rigorous answer:

(1) **W. Lawvere: The question is not whether mathematics should be
applied. Most of us agree that it should. The concern is rather that ou=
r
subject is sometimes being used as a mystifying smoke screen to protect
pseudo-applications against the scrutiny of the general public and of t=
he
scientific colleagues in adjacent disciplines. We need to ensure that
applications themselves be maximally effective, not clouded by
misunderstanding.**

Now, an example of superficial conclusions:

** J. Baez: Indeed, the funny thing about string theory is that while
leading to an abundant harvest of rigorous mathematical results, it has
not yet correctly predicted a single result from a single experiment,
even after more than 20 years of work on the part of many smart people.=
**

There is nothing funny about this. Lubos say:

** Motl: One of the fascinating features of string theory is that its
objects and investigations, even though they've been partially
disconnected from the daily exchanges with the experimentalists, remain=
ed
extremely physical in character. All of the objects that we deal with a=
re
analogous to some objects in well-known working physical theories, to s=
ay
the least.**

Bill has made a serious, well fundamented and non-bullshit contribution=
 to
"crack and pots" (he utilizes a different heading:" WHY ARE WE CONCERNE=
D?")

In contrast to many passages of some contributors that it will be tires=
ome
to reproduce here, and where one founds an overwhelming proliferation o=
f =20

highly technical, sophisticated, difficult and impressively sounding wo=
rds=20

such that it becomes impossible to see what they are saying, unless you
are an expert, in which case you may find out that it is only superfici=
al
thinking  (I am thinking specially in certain parts of  Davis Yetter's
postings).

** W. Lawvere: Professors may not consider the possibility of learning
from undergraduate text books, and some may feel bored that I have once
again repeated the above basic definitions and observations.**

If you have some real thoughts, you do not need impressive jargon.

See what an original and deep insight:

** W. Lawvere: As quantity includes zero, so structure includes the cas=
e
of no structure, which Cantor considered one of his most profound and
exciting discoveries**

Superficial thinking  (which could be malicious, but very often is simp=
ly
stupid) has manifested itself in these postings  by pushing forward the
idea that there are two different  kinds of category theory: =20

"Categories as Foundation" and  "Categories as Algebra", the first
implicitly (but not explicitly said) the "bad one", and the second the
"good" one.=20

** D. Yetter: All of these are part and parcel of a different face of
category theory than one saw in the old days: category theory as algebr=
a,
rather than category theory as foundations.**

We have an excellent analysis of this fallacy in Bill's postings, which
should be read carefully and slowly. =20

I imagine now to add something that Lawvere himself pointed out a long
time ago: The laws of logic are a particular instance of the categorica=
l
concept of adjoint functors, a concept that grew out of mathematical
experience. =20

There is any way some explanation to Yetter's prejudice against=20
"categories as foundation".  Often very poor category theory has been
justified by people writing on foundations. Bill's quote (1) above also
applies to this and related use of category theory in theoretical compu=
ter
science.  =20

Somebody else that does not need either noisy language sees better:

** Dusko: I am of course saying things very clear and familiar to many
people on this list, but maybe they are worth saying nevertheless.**

** Dusko: but at the end of the day, I think, we'll all agree that the
source of the unreasonable effectiveness of categorical algebra is its
foundational content **=20

Then, he passes to consider Grothendiek's  ("the greatest of the
category theorists") work  on Topos theory as work on foundations, whic=
h
agrees with the analysis of foundations made by Lawvere.

I can not restrain myself to quote the following magnificent piece of
meaningless  hallucinogenic  discourse:

**V. Pratt: In the millions of years of evolution of primate thinking, =
no
productive mathematical mechanism has a higher probability of being
stumbled on than mathematics founded on the Yoneda axiom. I know of no
better explanation of how human thought could have evolved to its prese=
nt
form than evolution finding and exploiting the Yoneda principle**

Now, some serious business:=20

In recent years J.Baez and his followers have been occupying more and m=
ore
space in the categorical community (this fact is at the starting point =
of
the present debate).=20

I think this is so because they have some interesting category theory t=
o
show, but they are occupying more space than their mathematics deserves=
=20
because they bring a refreshing air to a community until now dominated =
by
an old guard that has not shown signs of necessary evolution, and that =
has
not being able to attract very good and talented young mathematicians t=
o
the community. There is now not other exiting body of developments with=
in
the community. The old guard is being pushed out (prone or supine ?), b=
ut,
alas, not by better mathematicians. =20

Category theory is in good shape (in particular pushed forward by the
Russian school), and it is now passing over the category community. I
have lost the information now, but recently it was in Europe an importa=
nt
congress that it had two subjects: one was a prestigious subject (that =
I
do not remember now), the other was category theory. Not a single name
(including Baez group) that we see in the category theory community
meetings was there.

Best wishes to all   e.d.

This, and much else about Lefschetz has to tell us a lot.  As to proof,
Lefschetz also never published a theorem without a purported proof, and
he often came to feel very strongly that his proofs were not good
enough.  He wrote two long books on topology in the attempt to repair
the bad proofs in his influential booklet on cohomology in algebraic
topology, L'Analysis situs et la Topologie Algebrique.  It was so
important to him that he enlisted many others.  Notably for us, he
asked Eilenberg and Mac Lane to contribute an appendix to his 1942
TOPOLOGY.  This was their first published collaboration "On homology
groups of infinite complexes and compacta" and pursued the questions
that quickly led to category theory.

Lefschetz had encouraged work on solving specific problems just over
the edge of what well-understood foundations for homology could
handle.  Apparently he believed such solutions would lead to
significantly deeper understanding.  He had encouraged Steenrod to work
on p-adic solenoids because existing methods did not seem adequate to
it.  But whatever his motive, he was determined to see rigorous
solutions to quite specific problems.

The proof that Vaughan outlined is found in almost exactly the same form
in Courant & Robbins, published around 60 years ago.

Here is a proof I learned in grad school, based on three facts, one
analytic and two algebraic.  The analytic fact, which is an irreducible
minimum, given that the reals cannot be defined algebraically (except as a
real closed field of continuum transcendence degree, which misses the
point) is the intermediate value theorem.  In other words, order
completeness.  From this follows the fact that every odd order polynomial
has a (real) root and that every real number--and with a bit of
manipulation, every complex number--has a complex square root.  The
algebraic facts are the existence of a splitting field and the theorem on
elementary symmetric functions, neither of which is quite trivial, nor
very deep.

The way you do it is by proving that every real polynomial of degree n =
2^k*m with m odd has a complex root, by induction on k.  The case k = 0 is
quite trivial, of course.  So suppose that f is a real polynomial of even
degree n and, in some splitting field has roots r_1,...,r_n.  For each
integer s form the polynomial f_s = \prod{i<j}(x - r_i - r_j - sr_ir_j)
which has degree n(n-1)/2, which is less 2 divisible than n.  The theorem
on symmetric functions implies it is real and hence for some i and j
dependent on s, r_i + r_j + sr_ir_j is in C.  Since there are only
finitely many pairs i and j and infinitely many integers, there are
distinct s and t for which both r_i + r_j + sr_ir_j and r_i + r_j +
tr_ir_j belong to C.  Given that C has square roots, one easily discovers
that r_i and r_j are both complex numbers.  To go from real to complex
polynomials, just multiply a complex polynomial by its conjugate; for a
root r of the product, one of r and its conjugate is a root of the
original.  And the process of factoring completely is well-known.

Incidentally, it is the case that if K is an algebraic extension of L and
every polynomial with coefficients in L has at least one root in K, then K
is an algebraic closure of L.  The argument above pretty much does the
characteristic 0; the prime case is trickier.

This is not entirely elementary, but then neither is the winding number
argument.  Comparing them is difficult because the algebraic argument I
have given could all be taught in a lower division course, while the
winding number argument, intuitively appealing, really requires some
sophisticated stuff to deal with rigorously.

Which raises an interesting question.  If we agree, as we seem to, that
proof is the essence of what we mean by mathematics, then what does it
mean to give an intuitively appealing non-proof and call it a proof?

Michael

I really doubt those authors were unaware of the topological proof
of the fundamental theorem of calculus in 1987.  After all, it's
exercise H.5 in chapter 1 of Spanier's "Algebraic Topology", copyright
1966.  This book used to be the canonical textbook on algebraic
topology, and Peter Hilton is a darn good algebraic topologist.

I think I learned this topological proof sometime in grad school,
around 1986.  So, I don't think it was any sort of secret by then.

I don't know what counts as an "elementary algebraic proof", but
people often say that there is no "purely algebraic proof" of the
fundamental theorem of calculus.   After all, this theorem is about
the complex numbers, which are often defined in terms of the real
numbers, which are often defined as a topological completion of the
rational numbers.  I hope this is what the Encyclopedia article
was trying to say.

There are some so-called "algebraic proofs":

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra

that use a bare minimum of topology.  These proofs tend to have
a purely algebraic core, namely "if odd-degree polynomials
and the polynomial x^2 + 1 have roots in some field, this
field is algebraically closed".  But, they use the intermediate
value theorem for continuous functions f: [0,1] -> R to show
that C meets these conditions.  So, I wouldn't call them "purely
algebraic".

It's sort of ironic that the so-called "fundamental theorem of
algebra" doesn't have a purely algebraic proof.

Gauss is famous for having given a proof of the fundamental
theorem of algebra in his dissertation back in 1799.  On the
St. Andrews math history website they write:

  Gauss's proof of 1799 is topological in nature and has some
  rather serious gaps.  It does not meet our present day
  standards required for a rigorous proof.

They don't say how the proof went.  So, I decided to find out!
I was hoping I could irritate you by showing that it was just
the topological proof you claim is so new.  There's a discussion
of it here:

Hans Willi Siegberg
Some Historical Remarks Concerning Degree Theory,
American Mathematical Monthly, 88 (1981), 125-139.
(Available on JSTOR, or via Google Scholar.)

As the title hints, Gauss' proof uses ideas closely related
to the winding number.  Unfortunately, it's slightly different
than the proof you like.

The idea is to take a polynomial of degree n, say

P: C -> C

break it into real and imaginary parts

P = U + iV,

see where they vanish:

S = {z: U(z) = 0}
T = {z: V(z) = 0}

and show that the intersection of S and T is nonempty.

Gauss argues that far from the origin, S and T are smooth curves.
Because the leading term of the polynomial dominates the rest,
each of these curves intersects any sufficiently large circle
transversely at n points.

If we go around the circle these intersection points alternate:
first a point in S, then one in T, then one in S, and so on.

Moreover, the curves I'm talking about can't just disappear as we
follow them into the disk, since they separate the region where U
(resp. V) is positive from the region where it's negative.  They
may become singular, or intersect, but they can't just end!

"So", S and T must intersect somewhere.

This is true, but it takes more topology to prove it rigorously than
was available to Gauss.

Gauss knew his proof wasn't completely rigorous, so he invented some
other arguments.  The "winding number" idea you like is lurking in
Gauss' third proof, which he wrote up in 1816 - but he only gave this
winding number proof explicitly in 1840.  According to Siegberg,

  Indeed, in a lecture "Theorie der imaginaeren Groessen (1840),
  Gauss mentioned [see Fraenkel, 1922] that his third proof of
  the fundamental theorem of the algebra originated from his first
  one, and he gave the function-theoretic argument that the winding
  number W(P|S, 0) equals n [the degree of the polynomial], whereas
  the winding number of any map F: (B,S) -> (R^2, R^2 - {0}) vanishes
  if there is no zero of F in B [see Fraenkel, 1922].  However,
  this argument cannot be found explicitly in [Gauss, 1816].

So, I guess that except perhaps for Gauss, nobody knew the proof
you're talking about until 1840.

Best,
jb

Right, both my claim and its premises needed a fair bit of tuning (as
with my recent question about the quasivariety "groups+free monoids" --
this is a good list to get corrective feedback from).  (But a neat piece
of historical research there, John.)

The issue seems to be coming down to Mike Barr's question, which if I
can paraphrase it without changing its intent, was, what is the proper
status of an appeal to the very plausible in a proof?   My suggestion in
my last message to Peter Freyd was that the prover should point out the
gap, its cause (lack of a simple proof), and its plausibility
notwithstanding.

This suggestion raises more questions than it answers.

1.  Is a proof with a gap more acceptable for expository purposes when
the bridgability of the gap is more plausible?  (The case in point being
an extreme example.)

2.  How is plausibility to be judged?  By consensus, or are there
objective criteria?

3.  It is certainly not necessary to prove A before B merely because B
depends on A; indeed one common-sense practice when proving a two-lemma
proof is to get the easier lemma out of the way first, even if it
depends on the harder one.  Is it kosher to truncate such a proof after
the first lemma (or in this case the final result), call it an
exposition, and point to the literature for the second lemma?

Regarding 3, the authors of the Britannica article seemed not to think
so, but perhaps this just reflects Garrett Birkhoff's attitude that "I
don't consider this algebra, but this doesn't mean that algebraists
can't use it" cited by Michael Artin when proving FTAlg in his 1991 book
"Algebra".  Who on this list considers the fundamental theorem of
algebra "not algebra"?

These questions are probably more appropriate for a philosophy of
mathematics list than this one.  What makes FTAlg such an interesting
case study for those with something at stake in such questions is that
the tensions here are so extreme.  The final result (FTAlg) is not at
all obvious, whereas the lemma it rests on, whether it be that |P(z)|
attains its minimum, or that circles around a hole don't retract, or the
intermediate value theorem, or the existence of a root for a real
polynomial of odd degree, seems self-evident.  Yet the one that is hard
to see is easy to prove, while the one that is easy to see is hard to prove.

If seeing is believing, what is proof?  In the real world, when
something is easy to see it is up to the opposition to demonstrate that
it is nonetheless false.  How did mathematics evolve to play by a
different rule book?

Eduardo is quite right to take me task for tailing off into utter
incomprehensibility at the end of one of my longer postings.  There's an
argument to be made there, but that was neither the place nor the way to
make it.  One should not wait till the end to stop.

For anyone wondering what on earth I had in mind, try googling for
dipolar theories, which is what my CT'04 talk morphed into.  Feedback
welcome.

Apropos of googling for "Yoneda axiom," Steve Lack offered the useful
hint "Yoneda structures".

The illustrator of Hal Abelson's 1970 "Calculus of Elementary
Functions", Ellis Cooper, pointed me at it as an earlier reference for a
proof in print (or out of print in this case) of the growing-circles
argument for FTAlg than Pontrjagin=92s 1982 article.  But then Mike Barr
just now doubled that with Courant and Robbins!  (So how far back *does*
that very nice argument go?)

Mike concluded with exactly the right question, which is what I wish I'd
asked in the first instance: =93what does it mean to give an intuitively
appealing non-proof and call it a proof?"

Apropos of both my original assertion and that question, Peter Freyd and
I went back and forth a bit, and he suggested I forward the ensuing
correspondence to the list, following.  My answer to Mike's question I
think would be in my fourth last sentence, "By all means tell the
audience..."

Vaughan, surely you're not saying that the standard homotopy

It's the first one I ever heard -- and that was over 50 years ago.

VRP:
Hi, Peter,

As usual you're in the vanguard in these things.  But then why didn't
you or whoever told you the proof pass it on to one of Garrett Birkhoff,
Marshall Hall, Pierre Samuel, Peter Hilton (who *surely* should have
known, yes?), or Paul Cohn?  They're the ones taking responsibility for
the algebra article for the Brittanica (1987 ed.).  On p.260a they say
"No elementary algebraic proof of [the FTAlg] exists, and the result is
not proved here."

I was being told the same thing in the 1960s - if Gauss couldn't find a
simple proof in half a dozen tries, there isn't one.  The basic message
was, if you don't possess the necessary higher maths or the stamina for
an intricate argument, we can't help you with that result, ask us about
solvability of z^n =3D a.

My cohort may well have run into you in the Edgeworth David building
then, you would appear to have missed the opportunity to disabuse the
rest of us of this notion.

If you know of an elementary exposition of any proof of FTAlg appearing
in the 1970's or earlier I'd love to see it.

Vaughan



=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
PJF:
The proof was shown to me over 50 years ago as the standard argument
of why one should believe the FToA .It's an easily understandable
proof. But it is not elementary.

To complete the proof there's a lot of work to be done. Just try
proving -- from scratch -- that the circle is not contractible (if it
were, there's no way you could use it to prove the FToA).

There is a pretty elementary way that starts with the proof that for
any continuous self-map on the unit circle  C --> C  there's a
continuous  R --> R  such that

            h
         R --> R

       g |     | g
         v     v

         C --> C
            f

where  g(x) =3D exp(xi2\pi). (A proof of this doesn't require a lot
of background but it's a bit tedious.)

Then the "winding number' of  f  is the constant value (after you
prove it's constant) of  h(x+2\pi) - h(x)..And one can then
construct a tedious proof that the winding number is a homotopy
invariant.

But even with this there's still a lot of work to do.

There's another easy proof of the FToA (but also not elementary) that
rests on the fact that a polynomial mapping on the complex plane is
open and proper.

    Peter

Do you want to forward our correspondence (when done) to the cat net?


=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
VRP:
No problem, just let me know when.

My position is that this is a perfect example of a nonelementary proof
that *is* fit for general consumption, in contrast to one that can't be
grasped without first understanding the definition of some nonelementary
concept such as holomorphic function [better example: local compactness
=96vp].  Any child knows intuitively that a rubber band wrapped one or
more times around a pencil can only be removed from the pencil by
pulling it off one end or the other or by magic.  By all means tell the
audience that we're not going to prove that bit because a proper proof
is surprisingly hard for such an intuitively obvious result.  But
otherwise I would say that, at least morally, this is an elementary proof.

If "the rest of us" have been deprived of this argument all this time
(up to the 1980s or whenever) on the ground that this property of loops
is not an elementary one, I for one am very sorry not to have been shown
the argument long ago, in place of the ones I *was* shown.

It's a good thing sailors and scouts aren't taught by mathematicians or
they wouldn't be allowed to study knots until they were officers or
Eagle scouts.

WHY ARE WE CONCERNED? III

The second main misconception about category theory

Part of the perception that category theory is "foundations" (in the
pejorative sense of being remote from applications and development) is due
to a preoccupation with huge size. Since such perceptions hold back the
learning of category theory, and hence facilitate its misuse as a
mystifying shield, they are among our concerns. We need to deal with the
size preoccupation head on.

	Experience has shown that we cannot build up or construct
mathematical concepts from nothing. On the contrary, centuries of
experience become concentrated in concepts such as "there must be a group
of all rotations" and we then place ourselves conceptually within that
creation; we state succinctly the properties which that creation as a
structure seems to have, and then develop rigorously the consequences of
those properties taken as axioms. The notion of category arose in that
way, and in turn serves as a powerful instrument for guiding further such
developments. Placing ourselves conceptually within the metacategory of
categories, we routinely make use of the leap which idealizes the category
of all finite sets as an object. The question is, what more? Of course we
make use of the experience of those who have labored to justify
mathematics, and it is fortunate that ultimately our results are
compatible with theirs. (Mac Lane's use of the term metacategory is not
mysterious; it simply refers to the universe of discourse of any model, in
the special context where the elements of such a model are themselves
called categories and functors. In the spirit of algebra, we do not
concentrate on the cumulative hierarchy which might have been used to
present the metacategory, but rather on the mathematical category itself.)

	The supposed size problems of category theory are often
concentrated in functor category formation. For any two categories that
are objects of the metacategory, the category of functors from one to the
other exists in the sense that it also is an object in the metacategory
(it is unique by exponential adjointness). That existence statement is
compatible with standard set theory, although it is often presumed to be
incompatible.

	In the original 1945 exposition of category theory, it was the
Goedel-Bernays account of the cumulative hierarchy (see posting II) that
was cited as probably relevant (in case the problem of justifying category
theory should come up). As a result, category theorists have been worried
about supposed "illegitimacies" that might arise from violating the
Goedel-Bernays rules (which in essence stemmed from von Neumann). These
rules expressed an expediency which was a very effective trick at the
time, identifying two kinds of membership relation and truncating the
content at a plausible level. The Goedel-Bernays theory is well known to
have the same logical strength as the Zermelo-Fraenkel system. An
important advantage is that the greater expressive power of Goedel-Bernays
permits it to be finitely axiomatizable, whereas Zermelo-Fraenkel is not;
the greater expressive power concerns an element V of any model in which
all small sets of the model can be embedded (just as another smaller
element captures all finite sets). But the greater expressive power still
allows mutual relative consistency: To every model of Goedel-Bernays, a
model of Zermelo-Fraenkel can be constructed in a fairly straightforward
manner: just take the small elements; in the converse direction there are
two procedures (left and right adjoint?): given a model of
Zermelo-Fraenkel, one can take all definable subsets of it, or just all
subsets, and in either case a model of Goedel-Bernays apparently results.
Because these mutual interpretations are hypothetical, relatively weak
assumptions are required on the background category of sets taken as the
recipient of models. In fact, with only slightly stronger assumptions on
the background category one can construct, for any model of
Zermelo-Fraenkel, a model of what set theorists use daily as BG+, which
contains as elements not only V but W = V^V, V^W etc.

	Our practice is consistent with the minimal assumptions of
professional set theorists: For any model of BG+ the presented
metacategory of categories is both cartesian closed (in the usual
elementary sense) and also has an object S of small sets. (Those facts
strongly augment well-known properties, such as the existence of the first
four finite ordinals and their adequacy in the metacategory relative to
the sub-metacategory of discrete categories; of course these same ordinals
also co-represent one of the "2-category" structures on the metacategory).

	The category S is itself cartesian closed, and the categories of
structures of geometry and analysis are enriched in it. Of course functor
categories may no longer enjoy the same enrichment, just as functor
categories starting from finite sets may not have finite hom-sets; but
that is no reason to avoid considering them, and functionals on them, etc.
when such considerations serve mathematics.

	It is of special interest to note that the restrictive "law"
(under which categorists have been chafing) was already repealed forty
years ago by Goedel and Bernays themselves. In their correspondence of
1963, it appears that they had been informed that a student of Eilenberg
was working on a project to base set theory and mathematics on category
theory; their immediate response was that mathematics will have to
consider finite types over the class of small sets. (The relative
consistency was presumably obvious to them.)

	Even though most set-theorists have themselves maintained clarity
on the distinction, the identification of two kinds of membership in a
formalized theory may have fostered in the minds of others a confusion
between smallness (of a class or set) and existence as an element of the
(meta)universe. Certainly, the specific meaning of smallness needs to be
clarified (although for some purposes it can be taken as a parameter).
There is a way of specifying smallness that is directly related to
fundamental space/quantity dualities (rather than to imagined "building
up" by stronger and stronger closure properties).

	Just as Dedekind finite sets X are characterized by the condition
that a natural map
			X --->Hom(Q^X, Q)

is an isomorphism, so indications from the study of rings of continuous
functions and other branches of analysis strongly suggest that all small
sets X should satisfy the same sort of isomorphism, with the truth-value
space Q being replaced by the real line (in both cases, Hom refers to the
binary algebraic operations on the object Q). There is the possibility to
assume that conversely all sets X satisfying that isomorphism are small
i.e. that, like the Dedekind-finite sets, they belong to a single
uniquely-determined category S. That possibility in itself would imply no
commitment concerning the existence or non-existence of super-huge objects
in the metacategory "beyond" S, S^S, etc.  Such an axiom would be somewhat
stronger than ZF, but much weaker than the standard discussions of
contemporary set theorists.

I fell in love with category theory, in part because it did address big=20=

ghettoization of category theory within mathematics.

I began my post with the story of Moishe Flato's dismissal of category=20=

theory as 'a mere
language' and his repentance from that view.  I chose this because it=20

category theory as such,
and probably one most had not heard.

Dear Eduardo,

Your message contains many important observations with which I very much
agree, and a few others that need discussing. I may comment on it some time
soon, publicly or privately. Right now, my purpose for replying to you is a
different and more pressing one.

I noticed that in your "cracks and pots 93" you implicitly refer to a lette=
r
which I had sent to categories in reply to Peter Selinger, and which I had
also sent privately to various people, including you. The letter in questio=
n
never appeared!. It contained an attachment (to MacLane's article) which,
according to Bob Rosebrugh, was difficult to include, hence the delay of it=
s
posting, and ultimately my replacing it by a brief message in response to
Bill Lawvere, in which I included the URL, as suggested by Bob. It seems
imperative now that I post the original message, without the attachment.
Thus, portions of your letter may make more sense. It is below this message=
=2E

By the way, by my own count, there are only 75 messages posted in the
"thread", but 183 more that were written privately to me in connection with
it. Maybe you included some private messages in your count? Either way, thi=
s
means a *lot* of messages.


Best,
Marta

Dear Peter,

You were lucky to have been away on vacation, but perhaps quickly reading
(how else) the mass of postings in the "cracks and pots" has caused you
intellectual indigestion. Your reaction is therefore quite understandable.
For your sake (and that of others in similar situations), I will sum up wha=
t
caused my postings, and be more explicit concerning


>Is there any evidence to support this claim? I.e., actual examples where
>such research was disproportionally supported that was uncritical and
>perhaps unwarranted? There have been several posts seemingly agreeing that
>this is the case, but none have given concrete evidence.

1.
On March 13, I shared with you all a disturbing posting in Motl's blog,
criticizing category theory in its applications to physics, and more
particularly, John Baez. My concern was based on the possibility that any o=
f
this criticism might be justified because I could not failed to notice how
John Baez had become more or less a prominent figure (as speaker/member of
the scientific committee) in recent(ly announced) meetings in CT.
Explicitly, I was thinking of

Firenze, Ramifications of CT, Nov 13-19, 2003,
Sydney, StreetFest, July 11-16, 2005,
Union College, UC Mathematical Conference, December 3-4, 2005,
Chicago, MacLane Memorial Conference (Unni Nambondiri Lectures), April
7,10,11, 2006,
Halifax (near), CT'06, June 25-July 1, 2006.

2.
On  March 14, and in response to some,  I asked more explicitly what caused
organizers of meetings to bring to center stage one aspect of CT over
others, particulaly one which seemed to me not to be in good standing after
Motl's postings. Was it because it is indeed the case that CT is in
disrepute, and if so its reputation needs to be restored, this being the
best way to do it? Was it because it is funding for CT (notoriously lacking
in the USA) that may be more easily secured that way? I wanted to know
myself, but also possibly alert organizers of meetings to reflect on this
issues, since their power and responsibility is indeed enormous in promotin=
g
a certain kind of research over another.


3.
>From the many responses that I got (some public, and many more privately),=
 I
picked on one (March 17) to add some information that I had just come acros=
s
by reading Nature (on our coffee table, along with a dozen or so scientific
journals), in an article which connected Lee Smolin of the Perimeter
Institute with the Templeton Foundation, the latter a promoter of anything
they can in the borderline of science and religion. In the Scientific
American articles by Lee Smolin on Loop Quantum Gravity and the discretenes=
s
of the universe, a paper John Baez is quoted among the few references  give=
n
at the end of the article. This, in turn, led me to research the Templeton
Foundation itself, and with some help from a fellow categorist who seemed t=
o
know a lot about it, I easily located references to Templeton funding to th=
e
Goedel Centenary Symposium in Vienna, and to the A.Connes workshop on NCA a=
t
the Sir Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge. I was, however, relieved not t=
o
find any direct connection between Templeton and Category Theory. Still, I
meant to warn those unaware of this easy source of funding (with strings
attached). In a subsequengt posting (March 27) I gave explicit references t=
o
these claims in response to some queries.

4.
In short, I do not think that I can be blamed for not being explicit enough
in matters that I could be explicit about. I still do not have all the
answers to my questions. As I mentioned on March 27, I was mistaken in
thinking of John Baez as a promoter of string theory when, in fact, he
promotes a competitor thery, LQG. But the general question of categorical
applications to physics remained. Why are they promoted now? As you, Peter,
kindly offer as a possible explanation,


>Can one rule out another possibility, namely that such research is
>supported because it is original, timely, and interesting?

No, of course not -- one cannot rule it out. Here, I am ignorant of physics
so I cannot answer this question (David Yetter has supported the view that
they are original, timely and interesting, and has contrasted "algebraic" t=
o
"foundational" aspects of CT).  But even if the answer were "yes", I would
welcome responses  to the question which still remains unaswered (except
that most of us surely have a formed opinion) -- is CT in such a poor state
that it needs revamping? Sould we not wait a few years until several
original and interesting (maybe not timely) contributions to CT in
connection with other fields of mathematics are appreciated and incorporate=
d
into the mainstream? What do we gain by pushing those under the rag? To
imply, perhaps, that we ourselves do not value them? These, I believe, are
crucial and timely questions, and I do not regret unwilingly having brought
them up

5.
I take this opportunity to thank Bill Lawvere for his first posting "Why ar=
e
we concerned? I", in which the lucid article by Saunders MacLane (Synthese,
1997) is recalled in connection with the discussions that arose in the
"cracks and pots" so-called-thread (why "thread"?). I am sure that most of
you have read it, but just in case you have not, I attach it here it in pdf
form. This is very timely in view of the upcoming MacLane Memorial
Conference in Chicago.


Peter, I hope that I have answered your questions. I can't speak for the
others who have contributed to this "thread". Unlike what has been
suggested, what I originated on March 13 was far from a "complot". It was a
genuine concern of mine and I see now, by many of the responses, that it is
also a concern of others. On the other hand, getting personally attacked
(for the wrong reasons, to boot) is a necessary price that I have to pay an=
d
it does not concern me as much.

Yours,
Marta

David,

your message below is clear and positive. It does clarify and help to
understand the issues in this debate. I think my own message was worth if
only to trigger your reply.

My message touch sensitive places and I hope it will motivate more
enlightening replies as it was yours.

Concerning your last remark "suggests that you are content to remain in
the ghetto, and want to keep the rest of us there with you". I do not see
the logic by which you think this statment follows from my message.

I do no want to remain in the ghetto, and much less want to keep anybody
else in it. I am happy to see that you also acknowledge in public that
such a ghetto exists. Some will be able to escape, and some others not.
Probably with time the ghetto will disolve in nothingness.

I do not know what "Peevishly" means, but please !! do not explain it to
me. Some day I  will look in a dictionary.

yours
Eduardo Dubuc
