Hello,

     Rob Goldblatt in section 9.2 of his book "Topoi: The Categorical
Analysis of
Logic" introduces the notion of a "skeleton of a category C" which he
defines as a "full
subcategory C-sub-zero of C that is skeletal, and such that each C-object is
isomorphic
to one and only one C-sub-zero object". This statement seems to imply that
we can have an "operator":

   skel: CAT -> CAT   where CAT is the categories of (small) categories

such that

  1) skel is idempotent on any member of C of CAT, i.e.
]
  skel (skel (C)) = skel (C)

  2) skel (C) = a "maximal" skeleton of C.

I am struggling with

   1) what "maximal" means in this case? E.g. is there some kind of order on
all the
           skeletons of category C?

   2) would the "operator" skel be a functor?


Kind regards, Bill Halchin

CALL FOR PAPERS

4th International Workshop on Model-based Methodologies for
Pervasive and Embedded Software (MOMPES 2007)

http://www.di.uminho.pt/mompes

within the 7th European Joint Conferences on Theory and
Practice of Software (ETAPS 2007)
http://www.di.uminho.pt/etaps07/

Braga - Portugal
March 31, 2007

******************************************************************
Model Based Development (MBD) comprises approaches to software
development, which heavily rely on modelling and the systematic
transition from models to executable code. One of these approaches
is the OMG=92s Model Driven Architecture (MDA), which is based on
the separation between the specification of a system and its
implementation using specific platforms.

This workshop focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects
related with the adoption of MDA and other MBD methodologies
(notation, process, methods, and tools) for supporting the
construction of computer-based systems, and more specifically,
pervasive and embedded software.

Suggested areas of interest in the workshop include, but are
not restricted to:
- Specification of Platform Independent Models (PIMs) and
Platform Specific Models (PSMs)
- PIM to PSM transformations
- MBD process for embedded and pervasive software
- Automatic code generation in MBD
- Testing and validation in MBD
- Tools for MBD of embedded and pervasive software
- Model-based development of hardware and software systems
- Model-based architectures
- Meta-Models for MBD
- System evolution and maintenance
- Precise semantics and consistency checks in MBD
- Integration of feature modelling
- Case studies on the application of MBD
- Models and techniques to enhance the security of embedded
and pervasive software

The official language is English.
Authors are requested to submit a PDF version of their papers in
IEEE format.
Papers should not exceed 10 pages, including figures, references,
and appendices.
Submitted papers will be reviewed by at least 3 PC members.
Authors of accepted papers must sign the IEEE copyright form.
Full papers exceeding 10 pages will be charged for pages in excess.
At least one author of each accepted submission must register
and present the paper at the workshop.
The proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press.
Position papers will be published online.

A category "is skeletal" if for each isomorphism A --> B the objects
A and B are the same object (A =3D B). With this in mind, the phrase
"and only one" in Golblatt's quoted definition is superfluous, being
a consequence of (rather than a condition required for) the definition.

Once one has a _choice_ of isomorphism from each object of C to =

the (unique) object of a skeleton of C that it's isomorphic to
(but it may take the axiom of choice to be assured of such an iso), =

any two skeleta of C become isomorphic to each other. There's =

no inherent "order" among the various possible skeleta of C.

Data making the inclusion into C of any full subcategory that =

is a skeleton of C an equivalence of categories IS precisely
such a "choice of isomorphism from each object of C to the
(unique) object of a skeleton of C that it's isomorphic to"
mentioned above.

There's little hope of skel becoming a functor without data =

of the sort just mentioned. Probably the strong temptation =

to "wish" that the full inclusion {SKEL} --> {CAT} (of the
full subcategory of skeletal categories among all categories)
were an equivalence of categories, or at least the inclusion =

of a full reflexive subcategory (with skel as inverse, or at =

least, reflection back down), is one to be steer clear of, =

if at all possible, in general.

Cheers,

-- Fred (Linton, and as of today, Emeritus from Wesleyan U. :-) )

Following on from Fred Linton's comment, an easy example is groupoids. For a
connected groupoid G, any vertex (object) group
G(x)= G(x,x) is skeletal in G. See my book:
www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/topgpds.html
(since I do all the publicity, I have to take every opportunity....!)
For many mathematicians, this meant that `groupoids reduced to groups'.  But
this reduction involves choices, and so cannot be made natural, which takes
us back to the first paper on categories by E-M!

Heller commented to me in the 1980s that on this reductionist basis, vector
spaces reduce to a cardinality. But, as he said,  the classification of
vector spaces with n endomorphisms is interesting for n=1, hard for n=2, and
unknown for n=3.

I have not seen a classification of groupoids with one endomorphism!

                   Call for Participation --- FLoC'06

                   The 2006 Federated Logic Conference
                          Seattle, Washington, USA
                       August 10 -- August 22, 2006

                   http://www.easychair.org/FLoC-06/

Early registration deadline: July 10, 2006.

We are pleased to announce the fourth Federated Logic Conference
(FLoC'06) to be held in Seattle, Washington, in August 2006, at the
Seattle Sheraton (http://www.easychair.org/FLoC-06/floc-hotel.html).

FLoC'06 promises to be the premier scientific meeting in computational
logic in 2006.  The following conferences will participate in FLoC'06:

CAV     Conference on Computer Aided Verification (Aug 17-20)
ICLP    Int'l Conference on Logic Programming (Aug 17-20)
IJCAR   Int'l Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (Aug 17-20)
LICS    IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (Aug 12-15)
RTA     Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications (Aug 12-14)
SAT     Int'l Conference on Theory and Applications of
         Satisfiability Testing (Aug 12-15)

The six major conferences will be accompanied by 41 workshops, held on
Aug. 10-11, 15-16, and 21-22.

The FLoC'06 program includes a keynote session to commemorate the Goedel
Centenary, with John Dawson and Dana Scott as speakers, a keynote talk
by David Harel, plenary talks by Randy Bryant and David Dill, and
invited talks by F. Bacchus, A. Blass, B. Buchberger, A. Darwiche, M.
Das, J. Esparza, J. Giesl, A. Gordon, T. Hoare, O. Kupferman, M. Lam, D.
Miller, K. Sakallah, J. Stoy, and C. Welty.

Seattle, the Emerald city, sits on the shores of Puget Sound surrounded
by mountains to the east and west.  Lovely views of blue waters and snow
capped peaks seem to appear everywhere - around the next bend in the
road or between the buildings downtown. Seattle is the gateway to the
Pacific Northwest, a premier tourist attraction.
In Seattle, Mt. Rainier enchants visitors; in Vancouver, British
Columbia, the Coast Range juts out over downtown; and in Portland, 5,000
acres of forestland north of the city center harbor deer, elk, and the
odd bear and cougar.

Online registration for FLoC is now open at:

        http://www.easychair.org/FLoC-06/

Deadline for early registration is July 10, 2006.

The rates agreed upon between FLoC and the Seattle Sheraton are
very reasonable rates for a first-class hotel in downtown
Seattle during the summer vacation season. To reduce conference
costs and keep registration fees reasonable, FLoC is
contractually obligated to meet a commitment for a certain
number of FloC attendees staying in the conference hotel. FLoC
attendees are strongly encouraged to use the Seattle Sheraton for
conference accommodation.  Deadline for preferred hotel rate is
July 21, 2006.

The situation is actually quite neat. Suppose that, for each category C
in Cat, one chooses a skeleton C_0, and isomorphisms from each object to
the choice of the skeletal object, as you say. Then, indeed, the
operation Skel : Cat -> Cat which sends each category to its chosen
skeleton can be made into a (necessarily weak, but thats the interesting
part) 2-functor, and can can be extended to an equivalence of 2-categories.

Its a special case of a more general notion :  if you have a 2-category
X, such that every object A in X has an associated object A' and an
adjoint equivalence between A and A', then the operation T : X -> X,
which (on objects) sends A to A', is in fact a weak 2-functor, and
indeed a 2-equivalence. Its all rather nice if you draw it out in string
diagrams.

A category "is skeletal" if for each isomorphism A --> B the objects
A and B are the same object (A = B). With this in mind, the phrase
"and only one" in Golblatt's quoted definition is superfluous, being
a consequence of (rather than a condition required for) the definition.

Once one has a _choice_ of isomorphism from each object of C to the
(unique) object of a skeleton of C that it's isomorphic to
(but it may take the axiom of choice to be assured of such an iso), any
two skeleta of C become isomorphic to each other. There's no inherent
"order" among the various possible skeleta of C.

Data making the inclusion into C of any full subcategory that is a
skeleton of C an equivalence of categories IS precisely
such a "choice of isomorphism from each object of C to the
(unique) object of a skeleton of C that it's isomorphic to"
mentioned above.

There's little hope of skel becoming a functor without data of the sort
just mentioned. Probably the strong temptation to "wish" that the full
inclusion {SKEL} --> {CAT} (of the
full subcategory of skeletal categories among all categories)
were an equivalence of categories, or at least the inclusion of a full
reflexive subcategory (with skel as inverse, or at least, reflection
back down), is one to be steer clear of, if at all possible, in general.

HEADLINE: Professor Paul Cohn

BODY:

Professor Paul Cohn, FRS, mathematician, was born on January 8, 1924. He died on
April 20, 2006, aged 82.

Mathematician who devoted himself to algebra.

PAUL COHN was a distinguished algebraist and the former Astor Professor of
Mathematics at University College London.

An only child, he was born in Hamburg in 1924 to Jewish parents. At 15 he was
sent to England on the Kindertransport, and never saw the rest of his family
again.

After four years' manual labour, during which he taught himself Latin, he won an
exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1944. He obtained his BA in 1948
and his PhD, working with Philip Hall at Cambridge, in 1951. After a year as a
charge de recherches at the University of Nancy, he served as a lecturer in the
University of Manchester (whose mathematics department rivalled that of
Cambridge in the early postwar years) from 1952 to 1962.

The rest of his career was in London: as Reader at Queen Mary College, 1962 67,
and as professor and head of department at Bedford College, 1967-84. The funding
cuts of the early 1980s led to the closure of the small colleges of the
University of London. Cohn left the Regent's Park campus of Bedford College for
University College, where he was Astor Professor from 1986 till his retirement
in 1989.

In addition to many visiting appointments he was elected Fellow of the Royal
Society in 1980, and served as president of the London Mathematical Society,
1982-84.

Cohn was a pure mathematician, whose extensive work was devoted to algebra. His
particular speciality was ring theory -the study of mathematical structures in
which, as with ordinary numbers, one can add, subtract and multiply, but not
necessarily divide -and in particular, non-commutative ring theory. Here, the
order in which one multiplies matters, unlike multiplication of ordinary
numbers, but as with the multiplication of matrices.

Cohn wrote nearly 200 mathematical papers, over more than 50 years. He also
wrote ten books, including the classic Algebra -this appeared first as two
volumes (1974-77), split into three (1982-91), and finally reappeared as two
again Basic Algebra and Further Algebra (2003). His best-known research
monograph was Free Rings and Their Relations (1971).

Cohn wrote on number theory as well as his beloved algebra, and was at home in
French, German and Russian.

He read widely and developed a particular interest in German history, the
background to his early troubles, of which he would talk freely.

He married Deirdre Sonia Sharon in 1958; she survives him, with their two
daughters.

     **********************************************************************

Cohn, P. M.
Morita equivalence and duality.
Queen Mary College Mathematics Notes
Queen Mary College, London, 1968 ii+79 pp.

These notes provide an introduction to, and an exposition of, the ideas of
Morita, Bass, Chase, Schanuel, et al., regarding the question, to be answered in
terms of the ground ring, of what module categories are equivalent, respectively
dual, to each other. The main goal is to provide a good presentation of the
equivalence theory; to this end, the notes of Hyman Bass ["The Morita theorems",
mimeographed notes, Univ. of Oregon, Eugene, Ore., 1962; see also Algebraic
$K$-theory, Chapter II, Benjamin, New York, 1968; MR0249491 (40 \#2736)] are
relied upon fairly heavily. A preliminary goal is to develop enough category
theory to get by with; the development is in fact very rapid, though not too
sketchy, but a little misleading or garbled in places (examples: the functor of
the exercise on page 8 is contravariant and goes elsewhere than is there stated;
the first two examples of equivalences of categories, presented on page 7 after
a brief sermon on the advantages of the notion of equivalence over that of
isomorphism, turn out, despite the readily inferred implication to the contrary,
to be in fact isomorphisms; the choice of the term "homotopy inverse" to
describe an inverse equivalence seems ill advised). A subsidiary goal is the
duality question, which receives an adequately careful treatment and is used to
open up the related area of quasi-frobeniosity.

		      UNIVERSITY of PENNSYLVANIA

    Citation accompanying the honorary degree of Doctor of Science
		      conferred on May 22, 1977

                          SAUNDERS MAC LANE

Following in the footsteps of Rene Descartes, Saunders Mac Lane has
shown that disparate parts of mathematics are categorically the same.

Establishing himself as a master of several specialties, he went on to
reach for universal solutions. In an age when mathematics has led to
increasingly complex resolutions, he has chosen to study the
similarities. By developing what seemed to some a nonsensical
abstraction for generalizing difficulties, he achieved a method for
unifying mathematics. Through his insistence that the triple of
algebra, analysis, and geometry are one, he has accomplished his
object -- the transformation of the map of mathematics.

As Max Mason Distinguished Service Professor of Mathematics at the
University of Chicago, past president of the American Mathematics
Society, and current Vice President of the national Academy of
Sciences, Saunders Mac Lane has given distinguished service to the
community of American Scientists. Young mathematicians throughout the
world, in deriving extensions of his work, have recognized its truly
global dimension.

With the knowledge that, in Saunders Mac lane, the scholar and the
gentleman are naturally equivalent, and with particular gratitude for
his role in bringing excellence in mathematics to this university, the
Trustees are pleased to award a former colleague and Associate Trustee
the honorary degree, Doctor of Science.

                           SAMUEL EILENBERG

Arriving in this country, a prodigy from Warsaw, when American
mathematics was but a kernel of its present image, you have nurtured
its growth over the years, and, in the process, naturally transformed
yourself into the most international as wall as the most American of
mathematicians.

A master theoretician of geometry, algebra, automata, and formal
languages -- our greatest mathematical stylist -- you defined the very
categories of modern mathematics. By mastering those categories you
enriched them, and by enriching them you laid the foundations for what
now is commonplace. When others were content to wrestle with the
complex, you created categories for the complex; when others ignored
the degeneracies, you faced them, when others found only obstructions
you founded the theory of obstructions. You created the exact tools to
classify the spaces of mathematics and the the space in which to
classify them. Your singular constructions became the standard. Your
style became _the_ style.

Expert in collecting Indonesian bronzes, and poker chips, while
eschewing formal honors, you have nonetheless garnered acclaim as
University Professor of Mathematics at Columbia University -- and
card-carrying member of the Society of Bourbaki. Aware that your
truest honor is the esteem in which are are held by your students,
including your colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, the
Trustees prevail upon you, Samuel Eilenberg, to accept from their hand
the formal proof of their admiration, the honorary degree, Doctor of
Science

I can confirm that Paul Cohn had a keen interest in categories.
As Editor of the L.M.S. Mathematical Monographs series in the 1970s,
he was responsible for accepting my first topos theory book for
publication in that series, and he didn't just rely on referees
-- he really wanted to understand for himself what the book
was about.

The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for researchers interested
in the structure theory of automata and/or the application of the
algebraic approach to logic to present their results and to combine
their efforts in the further development of the structure theory of
finite automata, tree automata and related structures in connection with
formal logic.

The scientific program will consist of invited lectures and contributed
talks. It is also intend to leave some room for discussions (open
problem session, etc.). It is expected that some Ph. D. students will
also attend the meeting.

Abstracts of contributed talks must be sent by e-mail to Prof. Zoltan
Esik, ze@inf.u-szeged.hu The abstract should be of no more than two=20
pages. The submission deadline is 20 July, 2006. Notifications of
acceptance will be sent by 30 July, 2006. We will announce the titles of
the talks.

A limited number of participants from ESF member countries will receive
free registration. Applications for free registration  must be sent by
e-mail to Prof. Zoltan Esik, ze@inf.u-szeged.hu by 30 July, 2006. For
details regarding applications refer to the URL given above.

If after the meeting there will be interest in publishing either a
proceedings or a special journal issue, then the organizers will take
responsibility of finding a suitable forum and will act as editors.

  SUMMER SCHOOL ON
  CONTEMPORARY CATEGORICAL METHODS IN ALGEBRA AND TOPOLOGY

  Haute-Bodeux, Belgium, 3-10 June 2007

In the tradition of previous meetings held at this location, a Summer=20
School on Contemporary Categorical Methods in Algebra and Topology will=20
be held in Haute-Bodeux, a village in the Ardennes region of south-east=20
Belgium, from June 3 (arrival day) until June 10, 2007 (departure day).=20
The primary aim of the meeting is to provide students and young=20
researchers who already have a working knowledge of categories with an=20
opportunity to learn about various topics of interest in categorical=20
algebra and topology, including

- categorical and topological aspects of semi-abelian theories,
- categorical descent and Galois theory,
- accessible categories and their applications to homotopy theory,
- lax-algebraic methods in categorical topology.

However, more established researchers in nearby fields who wish to=20
enhance their knowledge on these topics are also welcome. Lecture series=20
will be given by the following researchers who constitute the Scientific=20
Committee of the meeting:

- Maria Manuel Clementino
- Dominique Bourn
- George Janelidze
- Jiri Rosicky
- Walter Tholen.

If time permits there will be an opportunity for participants to present=20
talks on their own research. The local organizer of the Summer School is=20
Francis Borceux. It is estimated that the total cost of the meeting will=20
be about 975 Euros per person: this covers the registration fee,=20
transportation from and to Brussels airport or Li=E8ge railway station (o=
n=20
the designated arrival and departure days), accommodation and meals=20
(including conference dinner and drinks with meals), social activities=20
and an excursion (excluding dinner on the excursion day). Unfortunately,=20
the organizers do not have funds available to provide any financial=20
support.

Accommodation in Haute-Bodeux is strictly limited, and attendance at the=20
meeting will be by invitation only. However, anyone who wishes to be=20
considered for invitation, or to propose names of people who might be=20
invited, is asked to send an e-mail to Walter Tholen=20
<tholen@mathstat.yorku.ca> before the end of September 2006. It is=20
expected that invitations will be sent out early in November 2006. Those=20
invited will be sent formal letters of invitation to assist them in=20
obtaining funding, and will also be provided with a reading list of=20
material which may be assumed in the Summer School lectures.

The EXPRESS workshops aim at bringing together researchers
interested in the relations between various formal systems,
particularly in the field of Concurrency. More specifically,
they focus on the comparison between programming concepts
(such as concurrent, functional, imperative, logic and
object-oriented programming) and between mathematical models
of computation (such as process algebras, Petri nets, event
structures, modal logics, rewrite systems etc.) on the basis
of their relative expressive power.

HEADLINE: Irving Kaplansky, 89, a Leader In Mathematical Exploration

BYLINE: By JEREMY PEARCE

BODY:

Irving Kaplansky, a mathematician who broke ground in exploring concepts central
to algebra and multiplication, died on June 25 at his home in the Los Angeles
community of Sherman Oaks. He was 89.

The cause was respiratory failure, his family said.

>From 1945 to 1984, Dr. Kaplansky taught at the University of Chicago, where he
joined his famous former teacher, Saunders Mac Lane, who worked on topology and
category theory, an abstract branch of algebra with applications in computer
science. Dr. Mac Lane died in 2005.

Dr. Kaplansky's interests were similarly broad, and he explored the properties
of groups of numbers called commutative groups, also known as Abelian groups, in
which the order that a group's members are multiplied does not affect their
outcome.

He published ''Infinite Abelian Groups'' (1954, 1969) and ''took a big step in
showing how far you could go with infinite elements'' that are commutative, said
David Eisenbud, director of the Mathematics Sciences Research Institute in
Berkeley, Calif. From 1984 to 1992, Dr. Kaplansky directed the institute.

J. Peteer May, a former student of Dr. Kaplansky and a professor of mathematics
at the University of Chicago, praised his ''exceedingly incisive mind that saw
through to the essentials in mathematical arguments with precision and
clarity.''

Dr. Kaplansky went on to write ''Commutative Rings'' (1970), a work that Dr.
Eisenbud said remained in use and was ''narrowly focused on its subject, a
subject that, partly because of this book, has since gone much further.'' Dr.
Kaplansky later wrote about an area bridging algebra and topology, a field that
involves the study of real or abstract spaces, in ''Lie Algebras and Locally
Compact Groups'' (1971).

A noted pianist, he also composed music, often on mathematical themes, and
contributed to performances of Gilbert and Sullivan productions in Chicago.

Irving Kaplansky was born in Toronto. He received his bachelor's and master 's
degrees from the University of Toronto before earning a doctorate in mathematics
from Harvard in 1941.

After early work at Columbia, Dr. Kaplansky moved to Chicago in 1945. He was
named a professor of mathematics there in 1955, and a professor emeritus in
1984. He became an American citizen in the 1950's.

Dr. Kaplansky was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,
N.J., and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1966. He also was
president of the American Mathematical Society.

In 1989, the society awarded him its Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime
Achievement.

Dr. Kaplansky is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Chellie Brenner.

He is also survived by a daughter, Lucy, a singer-songwriter, of Manhattan; two
sons, Alex, of Hillsborough, N.J., and Steven, of Sherman Oaks; and two
grandchildren.

As a musician entranced with the mathematical possibilities of music, Dr.
Kaplansky once wrote a melody based on assigning notes to the first 14 decimal
places of pi. Called ''A Song About Pi,'' it received lyrics in 1971 from a
Chicago colleague, Enid Rieser, and has been sung by Dr. Kaplansky's daughter in
her act.

The FMCO symposium is an annual international event on the application and
development of formal methods in software engineering, with a special
focus on component-based and object-oriented software systems. We invite
submissions of tutorial papers on topics that fit under that rubric.
Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest for submissions include:
   - models and logics for object-oriented and component-based systems;
   - formal aspects of analysis of large systems;
   - prediction, analysis and monitoring of extra-functional properties;
   - applications of modal logics, temporal logics and model checking
     for the specification and verification of object-oriented languages;
   - type systems and type theory for objects and components;
   - probabilistic systems, process calculi, and semantics of object
     and component oriented languages;
   - reasoning about security, trustworthiness and dependability of
     component-based systems.

The purpose of the workshop is to consider the notion of internal act=
ion in
different categorical contexts and to relate it with internal structu=
res
defined thereby.

In particular, the well established context of semiabelian categories=
 provides a
natural setting for studying  the interplay between categorical and a=
lgebraic
aspects of actions, with respect to internal structures that may be d=
efined.
Nevertheless, more general  settings are worth to be considered ( lex=
 pointed
categories with sums, protomodular categories...)

Keywords of the meeting are: the representability of actions, suffici=
ent
conditions for their existence,  universal actions, categorical semi-=
direct
product and constructions, internal groupoids and internal crossed mo=
dules,
internal commutator theory, cohomological implications.


The workshop is intended to reflect its etymology, in order to give t=
he
participants a fruitful opportunity of debate and exchange experience=
s about
the subject.
That is the reason why after every lecture there will be time for inf=
ormal
discussions.

The backbone of the meeting are the lectures of the invited speakers:=
 Dominique
Bourn (Universit=E9 du Littoral), Marino Gran (Universit=E9 du Littor=
al) and Enrico
Vitale (Universit=E9 Catholique LLN).  Lectures are scheduled on Thur=
sday 26th
and Friday 27th (morning and afternoon), and on Saturday 28th (only m=
orning).

Attendance is open to everyone and other contributions on related top=
ics will be
considered with pleasure.

The workshop will take place at the Math Department of Universit=E0 d=
egli Studi,
Milan, Italy.
Detailed program, logistic and further information will follow.
