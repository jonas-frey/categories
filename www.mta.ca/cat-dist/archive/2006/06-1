A strange title indeed!

I have received many reactions to my mail about "prone " and "supine",
most of them  supporting my position, and I intended to wait a few
days, in case I had more, to answer globally to all of them. Especially
since I hoped to get a motivation of the proposed change from Paul
Taylor and/or Peter Johnstone who proposed such a change.

As I sent my mail on 30 Dec 2005,  I knew that the period might not be
the best, with vacations and celebrations, and I was prepared to wait,
say two weeks, before answering in order to avoid repetitions.

I received from David Yetter on Jan1 2006 another comment with the
following note, hence my title:

[Note from moderator: This is to let you know that I am invoking the
(not recently used) 48 hour rule for this subject: postings received
by noon on Wednesday will be sent; after that the discussion may
obviously continue, but not on the list.
Best wishes to all for 2006, Bob Rosebrugh]

I am still "on the safe side" of wednesday noon, and "hope" my mail
will reach you via the Category list.

I had NEVER heard of this "48 hour rule", and have many examples where
discussions on this list have lasted for much longer, even on subjects
that I considered a bit futile.

So I would like to know WHEN this rule was LAST applied, and HOW MANY
TIMES IN THE PAST IT HAS BEEN APPLIED AT ALL

I'd greatly appreciate answers to these two questions.

I cannot, of course, imagine that an unknown, or obsolete,  ad hoc rule
  has been unearthed to stop a discussion which has jut started, where
my objections, supported by mathematical arguments, and by many members
of this list, might happen to displease some person or persons unknown.

I realize now that some exceptional questions in Category Theory can
have indeed very exciting aspects!

I apologize for my English, I didn't have time to "polish" it because I
had a deadline to respect. Best wishes to all,

Jean Benabou

P.S. When I was ready to send this mail, I found via  the Category list
a mail by Hans Porst ON THE SAME QUESTION OF TERMINOLOGY, but WITHOUT
the note from the moderator. This rises two questions:
(i)-Is "the rule" EQUALLY VALID for everybody ?
(ii)-If I want to answer Porst's mail after noon to-morrow can I do it
through the list?

Jean B=E9nabou has three classes of arguments against "prone" and "supine":
ethical, mathematical, and linguistic.  The ethical argument
is particularly popular on this list, and the mathematical argument
(given in the post to which I'm replying) seems sound as well.
(But I hope that Paul Taylor or Peter Johnstone,
who used these words in print and sometimes read this list,
will reply, since they've probably thought about these matters too.)

However, I cannot accept the linguistic argument.
These words are not idiosyncratic, untranslatable English;
they are good Latin words with descendants in many languages.
It's true that they are both archaic or obsolete in French
(a loss for the world's francophones, I would say,
since they are useful words in any language),
but they have French forms that can be used.
Most of the other Romanic languages seem to have kept these words.

The Latin originals are (according to the Oxford English Dictionary)
"sup=EEn[us/a/um]" and "pr=F4n[us/a/um]" (where I use a cirumflex,
instead of the proper macron (TeX \=3D), to indicate a long vowel).
One can adapt these to any language that regularly borrows
from Latin (I'm afraid that I don't know how other languages
handle the Latin and pseudo-Latin that European mathematicians use).

I've also found the phrases "en supination" and "en pronation"
on francophone websites discussing sports medicine.
These are direct translations (at least for hands and feet)
of the English "supine" and "prone".  However, I don't think
that "morphisme en pronation" works as well as "morphisme prone",
even if the latter does resort to a 500-year-old word.

In Germanic languages (where compound neologisms are easier),
one might translate the meaning; a Google search suggests
that German words "bauchliegend" and "r=FCckenliegend"
have already been invented a few hundred times.

      Dear Colleagues,

  The journal "Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures"
(http://jhrs.rmi.acnet.ge) intends to publish a volume (maybe with two
issues) dedicated to the memory of Saunders Mac Lane who died 14 April
2005 in San Francisco. He was one of the most influential mathematicians
of the 20th century and he created a new way of thinking about
mathematics.
  The editors of Mac Lane volume are: Michael Barr (mbarr@math.mcgill.ca),
Ronald Brown (r.brown@bangor.ac.uk), Peter Freyd (pjf@math.upenn.edu) and
George Janelidze as executive editor (gjanel@rmi.acnet.ge).
  Have promised to contribute Peter May and William Lawvere.
  We hereby invite you to make a contribution. We are interested in
mathematical papers satisfying high standards appropriate for such a
volume and related to Mac Lane's interests, but also in papers related to
areas of mathematics covered by the scope of JHRS. The submission deadline
is end of August 2006. Papers should be submitted to any editor of Mac
Lane volume, where they will have the usual refereeing process according
to the submission policy of JHRS.
  The editors of Mac Lane volume could invite other mathematicians as
contributers.
  It would be a great honour for our Editorial Board to contribute and
edit a volume dedicated to the memory of Saunders Mac lane.

  Sincerely yours

  Hvedri Inassaridze
  Editor-in-Chief of JHRS

I have been asked why I reacted to the intended reeplacement of the names
"cartesian and cocartesian"  by  "prone and supine".  I have given several
reasons, but the one underlying the whole issue is the following:

The reason is that since a long time I have been worried about the ghetto
(in the sense of being isolated from the rest) characteristic of a certain
category theory community (or group of people). And P. May has reacted
concerning "prone and supine" probably because of reasons related to this.

The mathematical community  have been using "cartesian and cocartesian"
since always, and the introduction of "prone and supine" inside this
group will confirm even more the isolation. Examples abound, see M.Barr
introduction of "Molecular topos" to replace Grothendieck's "Locally
connected topos".

No matter how many linguistic points in favor a given name may have (like
prone and supine), to replace a well stablished  name intoduced by a
great mathematician (or school of mathematics) only puts you in
ridiculous.

P. May probably was feeling somehow that this will be extended by the
mathematical community to all category theory practicioners.

I profit by this mail to mention that concerning the concept "final" and
"initial", I am happy (and not surprised) to learn that these words have
been used since a long time to indicate the same categorical concept that
myself, and will certainly refer to the indicated bibliography to further
justify my use of these words.

Thanks to Toby Bartels I have got now an idea how to translate "prone arrow"
and "supine arrow" to German, namely as "Pfeil in Bauchlage" and
"Pfeil in Rueckenlage" (in Engl. "arrow lying on the belly" and "arrow lying
on the back"). At least in German such terminology would be "frowned upon" and
actually it sounds very strange. I haven't got a feeling how strange it sounds
in English (but I guess it does!).
The "linguistic" problem I have with this terminology is that I don't know
what is the "belly" or "back" of an arrow.

The intention of the suggested terminology (besides sounding funny) seems
to be to replace vertical/cartesian by vertical/horizontal. But then
one is sort of forced to call cocartesian arrows "cohorizontal" which sounds
a bit like "vertical", isn't it?
But actually, the "co" here refers to the fact that there are 2 ways of
being horizontal to all vertical arrows (namely a left and a right one
because the orthogonality relation is not symmetric).
So one might be inclined to call "cartesian" "right horizontal" and
cocartesian "left horizontal". For prefibrations and precofibrations one
knows that right horizontal coincides with cartesian and left horizontal
with cocartesian, respectively. But, unfortunately, for defining
pre(co)fibrations one rather needs the notion of pre(co)cartesian arrow which
cannot be characterized in terms of orthogonality conditions.

As pointed out by Jean for arbitrary functors (already prefoliating ones)
horizontal arrows need not be even precartesian (e.g. when all fibres are
discrete).

Finally, if one prefers to call pullbacks cartesian squares then one might
be inclined to prefer the terminology "cartesian" because the cartesian
arrows of the fundamental (also often called codomain) fibration are just
the pullbacks, i.e. the cartesian squares.

I rather have a different problem with "traditional" terminology, namely
that sometimes what Jean in his mail called

       cartesian        and     precartesian

is called

       hypercartesian   and     cartesian

Usually, i.e. when studying fibrations, this is not a problem
because all notions coincide. But if one considers prefibrations the
terminology cartesian/precartesian has the advantage that one speaks
about existence of cartesian liftings when defining fibrations and
about precartesian liftings when speaking about prefibrations.

Several people have asked me to explain why I brought category theory
into disrepute by introducing the words "prone" and "supine" 480 pages
into my book.

It's easy to understand why retired people of any generation would
want to carve their works in tablets of stone. It's equally clear that
they must never be allowed to do so - "Argument by Authority" is a
principle of Theology, not of Science.  It isn't even a principle of
mathematical history: for example, I recently learned from Renato
Betti's biography of Lobacevskij that early 19th century series didn't
"converge" but "annihilated".

As for Jean Benabou, I would pay more attention to his views on
fibred category theory if he HAD carved them on tablets of stone (or
preferably paper). Or if he paid more professional respect to those
(Peter Johnstone, Thomas Streicher and several others) who, in the
absence of the book that he promised 30 years ago, have reported and
developed the subject in the meantime.

Terminology, notation and proofs (should) evolve.  Of notation,
Riemann said that when you have the right one, you're half way to
solving the problem, whilst Eilenberg taught us how category theory
eliminates subscripts.  It's sad how often new textbooks copy out old
and clumsy proofs parrot-fashion - this is why I'm not enthusiastic
about mechanising them.  Given that category theory unifies older
disciplines, it necessarily selects amongst conflicting terminologies -
or completely replaces them, with frivolous words like "pushout".

For me there are three guiding principles for choosing names for ideas:

(1) certain words and qualifiers (such as regular, normal, semi, weak,
    quasi-, pre-) are already worn out though over-use, and should not
    be used again;

(2) mathematics needs to make more imaginative use of human language; and

(3) an ordinary dictionary should, wherever possible, be able to
    point the student in vaguely the right direction, especially in
    complicated abstract subjects like fibred category theory.

The word "cartesian" fails every one of these principles.

Rule (3) is my mitigation for two other offences that I committed in
my book, replacing "indiscrete" with "indiscriminate" and "proof
irrelevant" with "proof anonymous".

Eduardo Dubuc put my rule (2) very nicely:
> "strange," "charm," "beauty" and even "quark" itself are beautiful
> and poetic names to refer to objects or concepts which precisely we
> do not want to associate any precise meaning in everyday language,
> and on the other hand, the objects or concepts are introduced with
> those names.

However, he didn't consider that "prone/supine" fall under it, because
they "reflect in everyday language just one aspect of an existing
concept".  Presumably he has the geometrical aspect of these words in
mind.  But it was not me who introduced the vertical/horizontal idea
into fibred categories: these words are in Benabou's lengthy posting.

(I'm not impressed by Benabou's distinction between "cartesian" and
"horizontal".  As he notes, it does not apply to the subject in question,
namely FIBRATIONS of categories.  If he had ever written his textbook
on the subject, he would have realised that this is just the kind of
footnote that prevents students from grasping the key ideas.)

"Vertical" and "horizontal" would be fine, apart from the fact that
the fibrations that we find in categorical type theory, modules over
rings and other subjects are also op-fibrations.  This means that there
are two different kinds of horizontality.

But we are lucky: in the English language there happen to exist two
different words for "horizontal". Even more luckily, they happen to
be related by rotation from the vertical in exactly the right way,
as Peter Johnstone noted very concisely four weeks ago.

Nikita Danilov says that we should choose our vocabulary from Latin,
so (applying rule (3)) let's look these words up in Cassell's (1959)
Dictionary:

> pronus, -a, -um: inclined forward, stooping forward.
>   ... Transferred meaning: ... well disposed, favourable

> supinus, -a, -um (from "sub", cf Greek hyptios):
>   lying on the back, face upwards.

QED

You may be wondering how all this fuss started.  Ronnie Brown asked
for my comments on a small fragment of the book he's writing about
generalisations of the van Kampen theorem.  He was using fibrations
to construct colimits in the category of groupoids, which I said was
a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  However, I also told him that he is
the best qualified person I could think of to explain how "canonical"
isomorphisms conspire to form non-trivial groups, and so why fibred
categories are needed in "semantic" subjects in place of indexed ones.

In "syntactic" subjects (categorical type theory) there really are
canonical isomorphisms, not just arbitrary choices of them, and indexed
categories are appropriate.

In my opinion, however, both indexed and fibred categories obfuscate
categorical logic.  I spent ten years scratching my head, trying to
work out why people used them.   Eventually, I learned something from
Bart Jacobs: indexations arise because predicates depend on variables
that range over a set, but not vice versa.   Hence the way I treated
indexed category theory in Section 9.2 of "Practical Foundations".

Chapters VIII and IX develop dependent type theory in the way in which
I think it should be done, using "display maps" and not fibrations or
hyperdoctrines.  In particular,

- dependent sums, existential quantifiers and colimits are treated
  using factorisation systems - or almost, since not every map needs
  to factorise; and

- dependent products, universal quantifiers, exponentials and limits
  are reduced to partial products.

I would invite Jean Benabou to read these two chapters of the book that
I HAVE written, and only THEN form a judgement on whether I have "made
a major contribution to the field of fibred categories".

PS I drafted this text this morning, and had some friendly private
discussions about it with Eduardo Dubuc. We agree on many things,
but he maintains that established terminology shouldn't be changed.
As I have said, I believe terminology does and should evolve.  Also,
it seems that I misunderstood the second bit that I quoted from him,
for which I apologise, but as Bob says, it's time to bring the subject
to a close.

Jean Benabou has enquired, and this is also to inform other relatively
recent subscribers who, like him, may be unfamiliar with an informal
procedure used during the 16 years the categories mailing list has been
operating.

On roughly a half dozen occasions, though none in at least a couple of
years, I have judged that a discussion was becoming, as Jean Benabou
wrote, `a bit futile', usually after a couple of weeks. In those cases, as
in the current one, subscribers were invited to post any further comments
within a short period. Making this procedure formal was not necessary in
the past, and I do not intend to make it so now.

The deadline today was, of course, equally valid for everybody.

Best wishes,
Bob Rosebrugh

*** Final Call for Papers: Deadline 8 January (but do ask
if you need another few days) ***


                           CMCS 2006

8th International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science
          http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/cmcs06/cmcs06.html

                         Vienna, Austria
                        March 25-27, 2006

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 9th European Joint
Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software ETAPS 2006
                        March 25 - April 2, 2006

Aims and Scope

During the last few years, it has become increasingly clear that a
great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition
systems, automata, process calculi and class-based systems, can be
captured uniformly as coalgebras.  Coalgebra is developing into a
field of its own interest presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a
growing field of applications and interactions with various other
fields such as reactive and interactive system theory, object oriented
and concurrent programming, formal system specification, modal logic,
dynamical systems, control systems, category theory, algebra,
analysis, etc. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its
applications.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

      the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and
      categorical approaches);
      coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for
      programming languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
      coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
      coalgebras and data types;
      (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras
      (with bisimulations or invariants);
      coalgebras and algebras;
      coalgebraic specification and verification;
      coalgebras and (modal) logic;
      coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and
hybrid systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, Genova, Grenoble, Warsaw and Barcelona. The
proceedings appeared as Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer
Science (ENTCS) Volumes 11,19, 33, 41, 65.1, 82.1 and 106. You can get
an idea of the types of papers presented at the meeting by looking at
the tables of contents of the ENTCS volumes from those workshops ENTCS


Location

CMCS 2006 will be held in Vienna on March 25-27, 2006. It will be a
satellite workshop of ETAPS 2006, the European Joint Conferences on
Theory and Practice of Software.

Submissions

Two sorts of submissions will be possible this year:

Papers to be evaluated by the programme committee for inclusion in the
ENTCS proceedings:

These papers must be written using ENTCS style files and be of length
no greater than 20 pages. They must contain original contributions, be
clearly written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison
with related work. If a submission describes software, software tools,
or their use, it should include all source code that is needed to
reproduce the results but is not publicly available. If the additional
material exceeds 5 MB, URL's of publicly available sites should be
provided in the paper.

Short contributions:

These will not be published but will be compiled into a technical
report of the University of Nottingham. They should be no more than
two pages and may describe work in progress, summarise work submitted
to a conference or workshop elsewhere, or in some other way appeal to
the CMCS audience.

Both sorts of submission should be submitted in postscript or pdf form
as attachments to an email to cmcs06@cs.nott.ac.uk.  The email should
include the title, corresponding author, and, for the first kind of
submission, a text-only one-page abstract.

After the workshop, we expect to produce a journal proceedings of
extended versions of selected papers to appear in Theoretical Computer
Science.

1 - Let P: C ---> B  be a functor. I recall that  V(P) denotes the
subcategory of C having as maps all vertical maps.
I have been working for many years now on the following kind of
questions.
Given an arbitrary subcategory V  of a category C,
(i) - When is it of the form V(P) for some P ?
(ii) - If it is, what relation is there between all the P's such that
V=V(P) ?

2 - Before I go further into these questions, especially (ii) let me
examine a very important special case where complete answers to (i) and
(ii) are well known, namely when C is a group, the answers of course
are:
(i) - When V is a normal subgroup of G
(ii) - If V is normal, let  P: C ---> C/V  be the canonical surjection
on the quotient , and P': C ---> B'  be a functor such  that  V=V(P') ,
(I'm not assuming that B' is a group), then there is a unique functor
Q: C/V ---> B' such that  P'=Q.P , and moreover this Q is faithful .

I apologize for such trivialities but they will permit me to comment on
1-(i)and (ii) and to sharpen them

3 -  The "functor" P of 2 (i) is surjective, but FOR GROUPS this is
equivalent to ;  P is a fibration, which immediately suggests the
following questions for C an arbitrary category and V a subcategory
(i) - If V=V(P)  for SOME P, is there a FIBRATION  P' such that
V=V(P'). If it is not always the case, which V's are of the form V(P)
for a FIBRATION  P ? And of course 1 (ii) can be modified by asking;
what relation is there between all the FIBRATIONS  P which have the
same category V of vertical maps ? This is now purely a question on
fibered categories.
(ii) There are many variations on (i) e.g. replacing  fibration by
prefibration, but even for those who don't like prefibrations, here is
another kind of variation:
A group is a category with pull-backs, and group homomorphisms preserve
pull-backs, so in general one might ask :  If C is a category with
pull-backs, which V's  are of the form V(P) for a functor P WHICH
PRESERVES PULL-BACKS ?

4 - Let us return to groups. If C is a group and V a subgroup, not
necessarily normal, one can denote by  C/V the coset space (say right
cosets) it is of course not a group but inherits a rich structure from
the action of C on it.
Now if C is a category, what does  one need to assume on a subcategory
V of C to be able to construct an analogous C/V and what structure does
it inherit ?

I have studied  many of  he previous questions, and in detail the
question 4 for which I defined prefoliated and foliated categories
which are, roughly speaking, to categorical prefibrations and
fibrations, what topological foliafions are are to fibered spaces. The
quotient  C/V is then a graph, not a category, with extra structure
induced by the action of C, which for obvious reasons I call the
"transverse graph" .

Maybe some persons might consider this as "futile" mathematics. I shall
not try to convince them of the contrary. I'm personally very happy to
do this kind of mathematics, and my motto in this matter, and many
others, is "live and let live"

Greetings to all

In answer to the question raised by Jean:

>if C is a category, what does  one need to assume on a subcategory
V of C to be able to construct an analogous C/V and what structure does
it inherit ?

Charles Ehresmann had studied the problem of the existence of a quotient =
(or at
least 'quasi-quotient') category of a category by a sub-category, which h=
ad led
to the introduction of the notion of a "proper subcategory" (generalizing
distinguished sub-groups). His results, 	summarized in a Note (CRAS Paris=
 260,
2116) are developed in the paper on non-abelian cohomology "Cohomologie a
valeurs dans une categorie dominee" (Collloque Topologie Bruxelles, CBRM =
1866)
. Both papers are reprinted in "Charles Ehresmann: Oeuvres completes et
commentees" Part III-2 (and partially taken back in his book "Categories =
et
structures", Dunod 1965).
With all my best wishes
Andree Ehresmann.

              International Category Theory Conference
			       CT 2006

			June 25 - July 1, 2006
		       White Point, Nova Scotia

	     http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/ct2006/

The organizers of CT2006 would like to remind prospective participants
that early booking of rooms at White Point Beach Resort is important
to ensure a good choice of room. Note that not all rooms are isomorphic;
there are single bedroom cabins (with ocean view or river view), shared
cabins, and hotel style rooms.

                     http://www.whitepoint.com/

Even more importantly, if early registration to the management of White
Point Beach Resort that this is going to be a small conference they will
adjust the size of the block booking downward accordingly. At the moment
we have potential access to most of the rooms at the resort, but this wil=
l
be reviewed at the end of the month. Please book your accommodation by
contacting White Point directly.

        Tel: 1-800-565-5068 (U.S. and Canada)
        Tel: +1-902-354-2711 (international)
        Fax: +1-902-354-7278
        Email reservations: greatday@whitepoint.com

If you have not yet booked accommodation because you are uncertain of
whether you will be able to attend, please note that their cancellation
policy is extremely reasonable (a $5 administration fee for a timely
cancellation).

White Point Beach Resort have informed us that family members may share
your room for no extra charge, paying only for meals. The following optio=
ns
are available:

Adults              - $37 for breakfast and dinner,
                      $49 for three meals per day
Youths 11-18 yrs    - $23 for breakfast and dinner,
                      $32 for three meals per day
Children 10 & under - $11 for breakfast and dinner,
                      $17 for three meals per day
Or people can choose to pay as they go.

If for reasons of economy or sociability you wish to share
a multiple bedroom cottage but do not have a housemate lined up,
White Point have indicated that they are willing to arrange shared
accomodation (with people from our conference).

Further information about the conference can be found on our (updated)
website
               www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/ct2006/

We hope to see you there!

If you have trouble getting past this front page,
then go to the real home page of the restort
at <http://www.whitepoint.com/home.html>.

Despite what the broken front page claims,
you do not need Flash installed to use the site
(although you do seem to need it to view the rooms,
and you need Javascript and cookies to book them).

There will be a conference on category theory and its
applications in memory of Saunders Mac Lane, April 7
through April 11, 2006, at the University of Chicago.

The opening event will be a memorial service, or more
accurately a celebration of Mac Lane's life, on the
morning of April 7.  A number of Mac Lane's students,
colleagues, collaborators, and friends will speak
during the conference, including Steve Awodey (his
last student), Peter Freyd, Andre Joyal, Peter
Johnstone, William Lawvere, and Peter May.

The mathematical focus will be on recent applications
of category theory. The conference will be held in
conjunction with the 2006 Unni Namboodiri Lectures,
which will be given by John Baez on the afternoons of
April 7, 10, and 11, under the general title:
``Higher category theory, higher gauge theory''.

As MacLane's book ``Categories for the working mathematician''
emphasized, he was interested both in the internal development
of category theory and in its development with a view towards
applications in other areas of mathematics.  The conference
will highlight recent work that introduces new category theory
aimed directly at applications in differential geometry (and
hence to mathematical physics) and in algebraic topology.
As Saunders would have liked, most of the speakers will be
young mathematicians actively engaged in just such research.

A web page at the address
http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/MacLane
with fuller details will be posted shortly.

Following Andree Ehresmann's posting, and again in partial reply to
Jean Benabou, I would like to add some considerations on the quotient
of a category modulo a subcategory.

With best regards

Marco Grandis

------


1. Generalised quotients of categories.

     A very general notion of generalised congruence in a category -
also involving objects - can be found in a paper by Bednarczyk,
Borzyszkowski and Pawlowski [BBP].

     Here we will only consider a particular case, determined by the
maps which we want to become identities. More precisely, given a
category  X  and a set  A  of its arrows,  X/A  will denote the
quotient of  X  modulo the generalised congruence generated by
declaring every arrow in  A  to be equivalent to the identity of its
domain. (It exists, because the generalised congruences of a category
form a complete lattice, see [BBP].)

     The quotient  p: X -> X/A  is determined by the obvious
universal property:

- for every functor  f: X -> Y  which takes all the maps of  A  to
identities, there is a unique functor  f': X/A -> Y  such that f = f'p.

     It is interesting to note that  p  automatically satisfies a 2-
dimensional universal property, as one can easily deduce from the
fact that natural transformations can be viewed as functors  X ->
Y^2,  with values in the category of morphisms of  Y.

2. Kernels and normal quotients of categories.

     This particular case can be made clearer when viewed at the
light of general considerations on kernels and cokernels with respect
to an *assigned ideal* of "null" arrows, studied in [Gr] -
independently of the existence of a zero object. (For kernels with
respect to an ideal, see also Ehresmann [Eh] and Lavendhomme [La].)

     Take, in  Cat,  the ideal of *discrete* functors, i.e. those
functors which send every map to an identity; or, equivalently,
consider as *null* objects in  Cat  the discrete categories and say
that a functor is *null* if it factors through such a category (we
have thus a *closed* ideal, according to an obvious Galois connection
between set of maps and set of objects, see [Gr]).

     This ideal produces - by the usual universal properties
formulated *with respect to null functors* - a notion of kernels and
cokernels in  Cat.  Precisely, given a functor  f: X -> Y,  its
kernel is the wide subcategory of all morphisms of  X  which  f
sends to identities of  Y  (V(f),  in Benabou's notation), while its
cokernel is the quotient  Y -> Y/B,  produced by the set-theoretical
"arrow-image"  B  of  f.

     A normal subcategory  X'  of  X,  by definition, is a kernel of
some functor starting at  X,  or, equivalently, the kernel of the
cokernel of its embedding. It is necessarily a wide subcategory; but,
of course, there are wide subcategories which are not normal.

     Dually, a normal quotient  p: X -> X'  is the cokernel of some
functor with values in  X  (or, equivalently, the cokernel of its
kernel). A normal quotient is always surjective on objects (as it
follows easily using its factorisation through its full image), but -
of course - need not be surjective on maps.

     Now, the normal quotients of  X  are precisely those we have
considered in point 1. Indeed, given a set  A  of arrows of  X,  the
quotient  X -> X/A  is necessarily the cokernel of some functor  f
with values in  X  (eg, take the free category  A'  on the graph  A
and the resulting functor  f: A' -> X).

     The normal quotients of a category  X  form a *lattice*, anti-
isomorphic to the lattice of normal subcategories of  X,  via kernels
and cokernels.
     (More generally, this holds replacing  Cat  with any category
equipped with a closed ideal, and having kernels and cokernels wrt
it; see [Gr].)

Eduard Cech center had been established in 2005 as the national research
center focusing its attention to interactions between algebra, geometry, and
logic (and their applications in cryptology, computer science, etc.). It
is jointly operated by mathematicians from Masaryk University in Brno,
Charles University in Prague and Academy of Sciences of the Czech
Republic, with offices both in Brno and Prague.

The Center invites applications for several research positions commencing
during the year 2006 at the date depending on mutual agreement. The positions
are initially for one year with a possibility of extension for another year.
The candidates must be recent PhD's that obtained their degree not
earlier than 2 years before the beginning of their contract with the
Eduard Cech Center.

Candidates should submit a letter of application accompanied by a CV,
list of publications and an outline of their research project to
Professor Jan Slovak (slovak@muni.cz) not later than March 15, 2006.
They should also arrange for at least 2 letters of recommendation (one can
be from a Czech mathematician) to be mailed directly to slovak@muni.cz
before March 15, 2006. The successful applicants will be notified as soon
as possible but not later than April 15, 2006.

Further information about the Eduard Cech Center can be found at

*****************************************************************
FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTEND COMPUTABILITY IN EUROPE 2006

This is just to clarify the various opportunities offered
throught the organisers of CiE 2006 for PhD students and
researchers from the Former Soviet Union to obtain funding to
attend the conference.

The deadline for all the funding schemes has been fixed for
MARCH 31, 2006

Full details of how to apply are available via the webpage:

http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/cie06/give-page.php?14


ASL FUNDING:

CiE 2006 is an ASL sponsored meeting, so PhD students who have
taken advantage of the ASL very favourable membership terms (or
intend to do so soon), will be able to apply direct to them for a
grant to attend. See:

http://www.aslonline.org/studenttravelawards.html

EPSRC FUNDING FOR UK-BASED PhD STUDENTS:

CiE 2006 has obtained generous support from the UK Engineering
and Physical Sciences Research Council for UK-based PhD students.
For these grants, application is direct to the conference
organisers at cie06@swansea.ac.uk - see the website for details.

LMS FUNDING FOR UK-BASED PhD STUDENTS, AND fSU RESEARCHERS:

The London Mathematical Society funding for students is similar
to that from EPSRC. In addition, there is funding for researchers
from the Former Soviet Union, including some support for travel,
as well as for accommodation, registration, etc. Again -
application is direct to the organisers.

PRESENTERS OF PAPERS AT CiE 2006:

It is important to note that in allocating funding, the
organisers will prioritise presenters of papers at CiE 2006. The
deadline for submission for the LNCS Proceedings volume is:

THURSDAY FEBRUARY 9th, 2006

For details of the submission procedure, see:

http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/cie06/give-page.php?12

Similarly, giving a talk at CiE 2006 will improve the chances of

Hello,

let me add some remarks to Marco Grandis' posting.

> 1. Generalised quotients of categories.

I have not yet looked at that paper, but I think the "natural" thing is
to consider equivalence relations R on a category C, which are
subcategories of CxC (i.e. closed under composition, not
necessary full; identities are in R by relexivity of R). In my
diplomarbeit "Kongruenzrelationen auf Kategorien" from 1977, I
considered that, but I was not the first one. Some years earlier
there was a paper by Jacques Mersch from Liege (Belgium), which
unfortunately appeared only in an internal publication of the
university of Liege. Moreover, I think I remember that John Isbell did
something on this subject.

>      The quotient  p: X -> X/A  is determined by the obvious
> universal property:

The universal property is also obvious in the general situation. For
small categories, a functor with this property always exists, let's
call it a quotient functor. For large categories it my happen that the
hom-sets of the quotient become large, even if the hom-sets of the
original category are small. In general, a congruence as above is
not a kernel of a functor; the quotient functor may identify more
morphisms. In my diplomarbeit, I rediscovered an example, which
had already been found by Mersch. The quotient functors are
exactly the regular epis in CAT. But unfortunately, they are not
closed under compositon, so a quotient of a quotient of C need not
be a quotient of C.

Of course, this argument also works in the general situation.

Categories of fractions are indeed very well-known, but satisfy a
different universal property: to make *invertible* the assigned
arrows (instead of making them *identities*).

But you can view categories of fractions at the light of what I was
saying. Take in  Cat  the (closed) ideal of functors which send every
map to an isomorphism, or equivalently of those functors which factor
through a groupoid.
With respect to this ideal, the kernel of a functor  f: X -> Y  is
the (wide and replete) subcategory of maps which  f  turns into
isomorphisms, while the cokernel is the category of fractions of  Y
which inverts all arrows reached by  f.

Best regards   Marco G.

PS. And - thinking of Jean Pradine's message - yes, of course,
quotient of groupoids are important, but have special features of
their own; as he is pointing out.

Does anyone have any information on how Grothendieck's yoga for
deformation theory was transmitted to Schlessinger and Deligne?
or have a reference as to a published or cahier secret of Grothendieck
where it is outlined in his own words?

Dear All,

How can we prove that the class of weak equivalences of a combinatorial model
category is accessible ? I know how to prove that the class of weak
equivalences of a combinatorial model category is accessibly embedded in the
whole class of morphisms. And then it is accessible using Vopenka's principle
by [Adamek-Rosicky's book Theorem 6.17] . Can we remove Vopenka's principle
from the argument ? Or is this fact in the definition of a "combinatorial
model category" (for me, it's a cofibrantly generated model category such
that the underlying category is locally presentable) ?

Thanks in advance. pg.

                        FLoC'06 - Call for Papers
		    The 2006 Federated Logic Conference
	               Seattle, Washington, USA
                        August 10 -- August 22, 2006
                    http://research.microsoft.com/floc06/

In 1996, as part of its Special Year on Logic and Algorithms, DIMACS
hosted the first Federated Logic Conference (FLoC). It was modeled
after the successful Federated Computer Research Conference (FCRC),
and synergetically brought together conferences that apply logic to
computer science.  The second Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'99) was
held in Trento, Italy, in 1999, and the third (FLoC'02) was held in
Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2002.

The Fourth Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'06) will be held in Seattle,
Washington, in August 2006, at the Seattle Sheraton
(http://www.sheraton.com/seattle).

The following conferences will participate in FLoC'06:

Int'l Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV)
Int'l Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA)
IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)
Int'l Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP)
Int'l Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing
      (SAT)
Int'l Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR)

In addition, FLoC'06 will host 42 workshops.  Pre-conference workshops
will be held on August 10-11.  LICS, RTA, and SAT will be held in
parallel on August 12-15, to be followed by mid-conference workshops
and excursions on August 15-16. CAV, ICLP, and IJCAR will be held in
parallel on August 16-21, to be followed by post-conference workshops
on August 21-22.  Plenary events involving all the conferences are
planned.

Calls for papers for the conferences and workshops are available
at the conference website: http://research.microsoft.com/floc06/.
We invite you to submit papers to FLoC'06 conferences and workshops.

me that "fuzzification" in its usual  cottage-industry sense would be
seen by many categorists as the right level of generality.  But if you
wanted to do it for some reason, that's probably where to start.

There has been quite a lot of work on fuzzy sets and topos
theory: a Google search for "fuzzy sets topos", or
"fuzzy logic topos",  will turn up quite a lot of it.
I find it a bit surprising that there is so much
work, given the sociological characteristics of the
communities involved. But it's there anyway.

Hi -

I hope to see some of you in Marseille for Geocal06!  I'll be
talking about "universal algebra and diagrammatic reasoning",
and there's a bunch of lecture notes here:

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/universal/

Abstract:

Since the introduction of category theory, the old subject of
"universal algebra" has diversified into a large collection of
frameworks for describing algebraic structures.  These include
"monads" (formerly known as "triples"), the "algebraic theories"
of Lawvere, and the "PROPs" of Boardman and Vogt.  We give an
overview of these different frameworks, which are closely
related, and explain how one can reason diagrammatically about
algebraic structures defined using them.  We focus on the bar
construction and the relation between algebraic theories and PROPs.

(I feel guilty for not talking about operads... I'll do it if
there's time!)

Best,
jb

Does anyone know of a reference for the following definition of a
bicategory?  The primitive composites are:

  gf for composable 1-cells
  GF for vertically composable 2-cells
  f*G and F*g for horizontally composable pairs of each

with appropriate axioms including (G*f')(g*F)=(g'*F)(G*f), for
F:f->f':X->Y and G:g->g':Y->Z.  The horizontal composite G*F is defined to
be the common value of the two vertical composites.

You can find the strict version of that result in Prop. 1.4 of

 - M. Grandis, Homotopical algebra in homotopical categories, Appl. Categ=
.
 Structures 2 (1994), 351-406.

 I do not know if it has been written down elsewhere.

 For sure, whiskering of natural transformations with functors is used in=
:

 - R. Street, Categorical structures, in: Handbook of Algebra, Vol. 1, 52=
9-577,
North Holland, Amsterdam 1996.

 where you can find the notion of a sesqui-category (which does not assum=
e the
 "reduced interchange axiom" you are mentioning).

 With best regards

 M. Grandis

  I thought I had invented bicategories in 1967, and that, at the very=20=

and drawn pictures to explain them. Of course I denoted by capital=20
