Thanks for replies.

I am familiar with Breen's work, and the correspondence between crossed
modules and gr-stacks. I ws thinking more along the lines of "a smooth gr-
chart K (or whatever it is called) for a differentiable gr-stack G is a
representable surjection K --> G satisfying the properties..." (with some 2-
cartesian squares following). Such a thing might be in Champs Algebriques
, in the category of schemes, but I haven't got it at the library.

There's a result related to this (though not, I think, actually containing
it) in my paper with Andre Joyal on continuous categories and
exponentiable toposes (JPAA 25, 1982). We showed that there is an
equivalence (which is really a duality, but the arrows on one side
have been reversed) between quasi-injective toposes (that is, toposes
which occur as retracts of presheaf toposes) and the categories
that occur as their categories of points, which are continuous
categories satisfying a certain size restriction.

Something on this has been done.

Duality for vector bundle objects in the category of Lie groupoids
was done by Jean Pradines in 1988, and is part of the fundamental
work on symplectic groupoids. The cotangent bundle $T^*G$ of any
Lie groupoid $G$ has a groupoid structure with base the dual of
$AG$, the Lie algebroid of $G$, and Pradines' construction
realizes this as the dual of the tangent prolongation $TG$ of $G$.

A double vector bundle (in the sense of Ehresmann) is a particular
instance of a vector bundle in the category of Lie groupoids.
Pradines' duality can be applied to such a structure in two ways,
and these do not commute. If $D$ is a double vector bundle over
vector bundles $A$ and $B$, each of which is a vector bundle over
a manifold $M$, then $D$ can be dualized over $A$ and over $B$.
These dualization operations generate the dihedral group of order 6.
See `Duality and triple structures', pp455--481 of `The breadth of
symplectic and Poisson geometry', (Weinstein Festschrift), Progr.
Math., Birkh\"auser Boston, 2005.

Alfonso Gracia-Saz and I are preparing a paper on the duality
of $n$-fold vector bundles.

Details and references for the double case can be found in my
`General Theory of Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids', Cambridge,
2005, Chapter 9.

Whether categlorification would add anything to this I do not know.

First, let me say I have avoided contributing to this thread because I
don't understand what Vaughan is asking.  He knows, as well as anyone,
since he put them on the map, about Chu categories.  He knows about
*-autonomous categories as well.  So what is the question, really?

The simplest answer to Mamuka's question is the duality between vector
spaces (over any field, including the 2 element field) and linearly
compact vector spaces.  In the case of a finite field, linear compactness
is the same as the ordinary topological kind.  One proof of this fact is
that the category of finite dimensional spaces is self-dual and if two
categories are dual, the inductive completion of one is dual to the
projective completion of the other.  For finite dimensional vector spaces,
the inductive completion is vector spaces and the projective completion is
linearly compact ones.  Another example is the obvious duality between
finite sets and finite boolean algebras that gives Stone duality on one
hand and the duality between Set and CABA on the other, depending which
one you complete which way.

Most examples I am aware of of self-dualities are Chu categories (or chu
categories).  And if V_k is the category of k-vector spaces, then
Chu(V_k,k) (an object is a pair of spaces and a bilinear pairing into k)
is *-autonomous, as is chu(V_k,k) of separated extensional pairs.  Peter's
example is one of the very few *-autonomous categories I cannot relate to
Chu.  Complete (say inf) semi-lattices is another.

Peter Freyd writes on Pontrjagin duality. I would like to mention the
generalisation given in

 (with P.J. HIGGINS and S.A. MORRIS), ``Countable products of lines  and
circles: their closed subgroups, quotients and duality properties'',  {\em
Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.} 78 (1975) 19-32.

One point made is that a duality is not necessarily inherited by closed
subgroups and Hausdorff quotients. If it is, it is called a strong duality.
Then strong duality is inherited by closed subgroups and Hausdorff
quotients!

I have taught the classification of closed subgroups of R^n in an analysis
course. It is a nice result, and the sums you can set use duality in a nice
way - treatment borrowed from Bourbaki.

Duality is of necessity between categories, and involves associating an
object (say an algebra or space) of one category with its dual in
another, or in the same category in the self-dual case.  Downstairs,
i.e. in 2-CAT.  By "categorifying duality" I meant a duality of
2-categories in which one associates an object (this time a category
rather than an algebra) of one 2-category with its dual in another, with
the functors being reversed (op) as opposed to the natural
transformations (co).  Upstairs, i.e. in 3-CAT.

Regarding Chu, I was going to respond that the Chu construction works
downstairs with categories (from my usual V=Set perspective), or at most
V-categories, categories enriched in V, as objects of the 2-category
V-CAT.  However if the enriched Chu construction can be organized to
allow V to be a 2-category, with Chu(V,k) then being a 3-category, maybe
Mike is on to a promising approach (though it's not clear that's what he
actually meant).  It's an aspect of Chu spaces I know next to nothing
about however.

My first guess would be that it (moving Chu up into 3-CAT) ought to work
fine, with the caveat that the simple notion of Stone topology as a
totally disconnected compact Hausdorff topology would turn into the
proverbial thousand flowers---there's far more room for such stuff in
3-CAT than 2-CAT.  (Actually there's also a lot of unexplored such
territory even just in ordinary Chu(Set,3).)  Along those lines, Peter
Johnstone's mention of quasi-injective toposes dual to continuous
categories in his 1982 paper with Joyal is surely just scratching the
surface of the possible permutations and combinations up there in 3-CAT.

   Peter's

Oh, but complete inf semilattices are one of the most elegant
self-dualities of chupology.  They embed in Chu(Set,2) as those
biextensional Chu spaces (biextensional = no repeated rows or columns),
of any cardinality, such that the set of rows is closed under arbitrary
AND (think of them as bit vectors) and likewise for the set of columns.
  No other conditions.  Using OR instead of AND for both rows and
columns gives sup semilattices.  But that was in my previous post, where
I also mentioned that XOR in place of OR, at least for finite Chu
spaces, embeds FinVct_{GF(2)}.  In either case the symmetry of the
conditions makes the self-duality immediate.  All that is in the 1999
Coimbra notes I cited.

Hi -

> First, let me say I have avoided contributing to this thread because I
> don't understand what Vaughan is asking.

He asked if dualities categorify.  I guess he meant something
like this:

There are lots of interesting examples of a pair of categories C,D
together with an object c in C and an object d in D such that

hom(-,c): C -> D

and

hom(-,d): D -> C

are part of an equivalence of categories.  In the nicest examples,
c and d are in some sense the same mathematical entity regarded
as living in two different categories - a "schizophrenic object",
in the words of Harold Simmons.

So, can we find equally nice examples where C and D are instead
2-categories?  In particular, can we find examples where C and D
are 2-categorical generalizations of the 1-categorical examples
we already know?

In particular, he suggested taking the example where C is the
category of finite distributive lattices and finding an analogous
example where C is the 2-category of (maybe finite, in some sense?)
distributive categories.

For more on "schizophrenic objects", Peter Johnstone's review
of Clark and Davies' "Natural dualities for the working algebraist"
makes good reading:

Since Kirill alluded to my note  entitled "Remarque sur le groupoide =
cotangent de Weinstein-Dazord", published in CRAS, 306, 557-560 =
(1988), which I did not intend to do, I think I've better add some more =
comments.
The origin of this Note is an attempt to understand (and categorify!) =
the discovery by Alan Weinstein, and (more or less independantly) by =
various authors, that, given a smooth groupoid  G (in the sense of =
Ehresmann) with base B, its cotangent bundle T*G owns a canonical =
groupoid structure (apart from the abelian group bundle structure of =
course), which, when G is a Lie group, reduces to the action groupoid =
describing the coadjoint action (the base of this groupoid is then the =
dual of the Lie algebra; in the general case it is the dual vector =
bundle of what I introduced under the name of Lie algebroid).
The construction of these authors made an extensive use of the =
symplectic structure of the cotangent bundle, and of symplectic duality =
and orthogonality, describing the graph of the groupoid composition law =
by means of Lagrangian submanifolds. Actually they prove more, since =
they show that this groupoid is a symplectic groupoid (in a sense that =
has also certainly to be better categorified, since it is not easily =
described as an internal groupoid in some known category, but that's =
another story, which I don't want to tackle here).
I was amazed by this result, since, while it is obvious, by (covariant!) =
functoriality of T, that the tangent bundle TG has a groupoid structure =
with base TB (which describes the action of G on "vertical vectors", =
more precisely on the Lie algebroid), one would better expect for the =
cotangent bundle some kind of co-groupoid structure.
Finally I realized that the result has nothing to do with the symplectic =
structure, and extends in a natural way for what is called in my Note =
"vector bundle groupoids", which means internal groupoids in the =
category of vector bundles (without any given extra structure ). Such a =
vector bundle groupoid has a canonically defined dual object in the same =
category. =20
The construction is made "by hand", and I am not really satisfied with =
it (though it oversimplifies the genuine one). The point is of course =
that the"duality" in the category of vector bundles is easy to define =
and handle only when the base of the bundles remains fixed, while the =
construction has to cope with general vector bundle morphisms, with at =
least three different bases: B, G and the set of composable arrows.
Notably I was not able to discover some simple general duality relation =
between the nerves of the groupoid and of its dual, as one would like.
So I am still amazed with the result, which should become "obvious" in a =
better adapted framework to be discovered.
Best regards.

Enrico Vitale just sent me the answer for that one:  C = the 2-category
of idempotent-closed categories, D = the 2-category of presheaf
categories.  This categorifies C = Pos, D = StoneDLat by passing from 2
to Set as the enriching autonomous category (so in that sense one could
say we were in 3-CAT all along, though presumably only trivially so by
virtue of only having identity modifications when V = 2, I think).

Although I'd heard the phrase "Morita equivalence" many times over the
years, it meant nothing to me until recently when Bill Lawvere was
talking about graphs as presheaves on the monoid consisting of the three
monotone functions on the ordinal 2 and I finally woke up to the
connection between splitting the two idempotents and ME (the
equivalence, not the condition).  The idempotent closure of that monoid,
meaning the result of splitting the idempotents, is just the initial
segment of Delta of length 2, aka the ordinals 1 and 2 and their
monotone functions.  The impact on the models, here graphs, is that
splitting the idempotents results in giving the self-loops that were
playing the role of vertices their own datatype V, as coded by the
ordinal 1.  This new category of graphs is not the old one as its
objects now have vertices in their own right, but it is equivalent to
the old one.  {2} and {1,2}, each made a category with respectively 3
and 7 monotone functions, are Morita equivalent: they have equivalent
idempotent closures, and homming into Set maps them to equivalent
categories, the iff that makes Morita equivalence important.

ME is the kernel of idempotent closure, which is a categorification,
with Set in place of 2, of the functor Ord --> Pos (Ord the category of
preordered sets, Pos of posets) that collapses the cliques.  The reason
there is no representable duality between Ord and a suitable cousin of
StoneDLat (FinOrd and FinDLat for the Stonaphobes) is that preorders are
equivalent to posets and the Yoneda embedding taking elements of P to
primes in 2^P, while fully faithful, is only good up to equivalence.
(The homfunctor being transposed here is the order <= : P\op x P --> 2.)

The categorification of this, meaning in this case not the passage from
2-CAT to 3-CAT but from enrichment in 2 to enrichment in Set, still has
to deal with equivalence in the same way (though here it goes with the
territory and so is less noticeable than back down at Ord vs. Pos where
we tend to think isomorphism rather than equivalence).  But Hom: C\op x
C --> Set is not itself an equivalence but only a "retract that retracts
retracts", the essence of Morita equivalence (a dual of Freyd's "trivial
for a trivial reason"?).  In order to take the "log to the base Set" we
can't really "retract all the retracts" because we may need to keep some
of them around but then which ones (like picking a dense subset of a
continuum: which subset?).  We can however put them all in, which is to
say, split all the idempotents, so we do that in order to get a normal form.

The rest of this duality is then the triviality that the internal hom of
CAT is contravariant in its first argument.  Morita equivalence is the
only thing to be worried about.

Proposition 5.28 of Kelly's "Basic Concepts of Enriched Category
Theory", namely that Cauchy completion (Kelly's name for the enriched
counterpart of idempotent closure) permits taking logs to any autonomous
base V, then produces a proper class of dualities, one for every
autonomous V.  In particular we can recover Pos\op ~ StoneDLat by taking
V = 2.  (Pos and Ord, preordered sets, while not equivalent any more
than CAT and its subcategory of idempotent-closed categories are
equivalent, have equivalent objects which is all we need ask of a
duality.)  There are two "good" 3-object V's, the non-Heyting one of
which enriches the "prossets" that Haim Gaifman and I wrote about in
LICS'87, so these have their dual objects in the same way, by homming
into 3, a construct I talked about incomprehensibly at the Newton
Institute meeting on geometry in computation some years ago, not
recognizing that it was a duality.  Metric spaces, another duality
there.  And so on.

But then every such duality has its subdualities, for example Set\op ~
CABA as a subduality of Pos\op ~ StoneDLat, so a great many more
dualities there.

Enrico also mentioned the Gabriel-Ulmer duality for locally finitely
presentable categories, and the Adamek-Lawvere-Rosicky duality for
varieties.  Are these in addition to the above or can they be recovered
from them?  Likewise for the duality Peter Johnstone mentioned?

I thought about what John Baez said.  No, I had nothing in mind for a
2-Chu, but now I do.  First, let me mention that Juergen Koslowski gave
a talk on 2-Chu at a meeting in Santa Barbara several years ago.

Anyway, what follows isn't a theory, only an example, not worked out in
detail.  Let us form what I will call Chu(Cat,Set) without getting
involved in size issues.  (It could, for example, be categories with
finite homsets and finite sets.)  An object would be (\C,\D,T) where \C
and \D are categories and T: \C x \D --> Set is a functor.  (I thought
of making it \C^o x \D, but in the made this choice.  It could be
changed.)  Anyway, a map in this category is (F,G,\alpha): (\C,\D,T) -->
(\C',\D',T') where F:\C --> \C', G: \D' --> \D are functors and \alpha:
T(-,G-) --> T'(F-,-) is a natural equivalence.

Make the class of maps (\C,\D,T) --> (\C',\D',T') into a category
[(\C,\D,T),(\C',\D',T')] with objects as above.  A morphism (F,G,\alpha)
--> (F',G',\alpha') is (\beta,\gamma), where \beta: F --> F' and \gamma:
G --> G' are natural transformations such that
                      \alpha(C,D')
            T(C,GD') -------------> T'(FC,D')
                |                        |
                |                        |
 T(C,\gamma D') |                        | T(\beta C,D')
                |                        |
                v                        v
            T(C,G'D') ------------> T'(F'C,D')
                      \alpha'(C,D')
 commutes. Now define
 (\C,\D,T) -o (\C',\D',T') = ([(\C,\D,T),(\C',\D',T')],\C x \D',S)
 with S either of the isomorphic pairings that takes
(F,G,\alpha)(C,D') to T(C,GD') or to T'(FC,D').  Of course, they are
isomorphic by \alpha(C,D'), but you still have to choose one or the
other.  Of course, there is also a choice involved in the direction of
\alpha.  The dual of an object interchanges the categories and replaces
\alpha by its inverse.  But you do need an isomorphism here, in order to
reverse things.

Hallo,

in the PS to his mail on duality, John Baez wrote:

it would look interesting to me to show that uniqueness up to isomorphism
requires some kind of choice, e.g. by proving that it implies some choice
principle. I started thinking about this and came to the following
observation:

Let K be the field obtained from Q by adjoining all square roots of
(positive) primes or - equivalently - of all positive rational numbers.
Then an algebraic closureof K is obviously the same as an algebraic
closure of Q - even without choice. Now consider an arbitrary sequence of
two element sets S(n), w.l.o.g. pairwise disjoint, and let S be their
union. Now consider the polynomial ring Q(S) over Q in variables x(s) for
all s in S. For each natural number n let p(n) be the n-th prime and
consider the poynomials f_n:=x(s)+x(t) and g_n:=x(s)x(t)+p(n)  in Q(S)
where S(n) consists of the two elements s and t. Now let K' be the factor
ring obtained from Q(S) by dividing out all f_n and g_n. If we have a
choice function which assigns to each n an element s(n) in S(N), then
there is a unique isomorphism from K' to K that maps each s(n) to the
(positive)  square root of p(n). Conversely, if we have an arbitrary
isomorphism j from K' to K, we get a choice function which chooses for the
each n unique s(n) in S(n) with j(n)>0.  Thus existence of an isomorphism
is equivalent to existence of a choice function.

If the existence of an algebraic closure of K' could be shown without
choice, then an isomorphism fom this algebraic closure to the set of
algebraic complex numbers would restrict to an isomorphism between K and
K' and thus render a chioce function for the S(n). Thus the
uniqueness-up-to-isomorphism would imply choice for countable families of
two-element sets. Maybe refinement oft his argument could even be used to
get stronger choice principles.

Is there a reference for the fact that a countable decidably ordered field
has a constructable (and decidably ordered) real closure?

Maybe 20 years ago, an undergraduate did a project under my supervision
proving exactly that (although the proofs are not constructive). While I
don't think it would prove feasible for actual computation, the fact that
it exists is interesting.  Finally, I have looked more closely at it and
if it is not known, I think it publishable.  Unfortunately, the student
(who was a Commonwealth Fellow at Cambridge) lost interest in math and is
doing other things.  But I think I know how to get in touch with him.

Dear Michael,

In my paper "Sheaves and Prime Model Extensions", J. of Algebra 68 (1981)
79-96, there is a proof of the existence of the real closure of an ordered
field in any elementary topos, plus considerations about the failure of the
existence of the algebraic closure. The context is more general (model
theory in toposes), and there are other instances which I do not recall
offhand. Maybe that is not what you are asking? I thought that I would
mention it, just in case.

Marta

I don't think this is what I was asking, although it may be related.
Certainly, the context I have is one in which if you have a real closure
and adjoin i, you get an algebraic closure.  And the real closure is
unique because it is the usual real closure.  In fact, the usual real
closure is used to prove some things.  As I said, the construction is
constructive; the proofs are classical.

Let me give an example of the flavor.  Suppose you want to have a square
root of a > 0.  It is decidable (by hypothesis) if a > 0; what may not be
decidable is whether a has a square root.  What the student did (he
credits Joyal with some of the main ideas, BTW, and this may be one of
them) was to form F[x]/I where I is the ideal of all polynomials that
vanish at sqrt(a).  Even though it may not be decidable if sqrt(a) in F,
it is still decidable if a polynomial vanishes there.  First use Sturm's
criterion to find an interval that contains exactly one root of f(x) = x^2
- a (in a real closure) and then for any polynomial g, g is in I iff
gcd(f,g) has a root in that interval, again using Sturm's criterion.
Clearly, F[x]/I contains a square root of a, even if it is not decidable
whether that field is F.

Dear Mike:
   One reference is the work of M-F Coste-Roy and H. Lombardi in Real
Algebraic Geometry; a quick Google search yielded:

http://hlombardi.free.fr/publis/AMega90-1.html

Also they have some papers in the J.ACM, apparently.

In fact, it seems to be a huge area of model theory:  see

i think if Q has discrete topology then algebraic closure of Q as same as
topological closure Q so that study of cl(Q) is easier.
is it true?

Dear Michael,

It is related to what I did, but in a different way. BTW, I remembered
something incorrectly. In my
J. Alg '81 paper, I actually use (not prove) Joyal's result on the existence
of the real closure of an ordered field ("Cloture algebrique reelle d'un
corps ordonne", Lecture, Universite de Montreal, January 1979). The proof is
indeed classical, so this holds (at least) in any topos which is a BVMST
(Boolean-valued-model of Set Theory), not in every topos. I show that for
certain toposes E, the result is till true. I was mostly interested in
toposes E which arise in sheaf represenation theorems for algebraic
structures (such as von Neuman regular (differential) rings).

First, I prove a general theorem for quotients T-->T* of coherent theories
satisfying (what I call) the "Sturm property" in a topos E, to the effect
that prime model extensions of Mod_{E}(T) in Mod_{E}(T*) exist and are
preserved by continuous functors.

For instance, I show that the real closure exists in toposes E = Sh_fc(B)
(sheaves for finite covers in a Boolean algebra B). The example of T--->T*
with T = {ordered fields} and T* = {real closed fields} is shown to have the
Sturm property in E = Sh_{fc}(B)  by resorting to a "mid-way-house method",
first via the Gleason cover of E, and then taking its topos of double
negation sheaves, which is a BVMST.
By transfer, I obtain that every commutative regular f-ring (in Sets) has an
(invariant, and an atomless) real closure.

Another example is that of the differential closure of a differential field
and a transfer to differential Von Neuman regular rings of non-zero
characteristic.

The question of characterizing toposes E for which a certain quotient T-->T*
of coherent theories has the "Sturm property" is open. As I said, I was only
interested in sheaf representations by global sections, so I only looked at
such toposes.

Best,
Marta

Mike asks:

  Is there a reference for the fact that a countable decidably ordered
  field has a constructable (and decidably ordered) real closure?

The expert on all such questions is Anil Nerode .See his Effective
content of field theory (Ann. Math. Logic 17 (1979), no. 3, 289--320)
for a collection of all the relevant results.

John writes:

  Briefly, while the existence of an algebraic closure of Q
  can be shown without choice, it uniqueness-up-to-isomorphism
  seems to require choice.  Also, while arithmetic operations
  in Qbar are computable, they seem to present interesting challenges.

The need for choice could hardly arise when working with a decidable
countable structure such as  Q.

One way of naming an algebraic real number is with an ordered triple
<l, P, r>, where  l  and  r  are rationals, P  a monic polynomial with
rational coeficients that is irreducible over the rationals (the
decidablity of which can be found in van der Waerden) such that
P(l)P(r) < 0  and  R(l)R(r) > 0  for  R  any of the non-tivial iterated
derivatives of  P. Another such triple names the same element iff the
polynomials are the same and the intervals overlap. Effective
constructions for the ordered-field operations in this context are
pretty standard.

THE SPRING SCHOOL

The Spring School in Theoretical Computer Science is a French institution,
started by Maurice Nivat in 1973.

The School is based on a simple but extraordinarily successful recipe:
bring together the world's specialists of a different topic every year,
for a week, in a beautiful and somewhat recluded part of France.

This year, the Spring School will meet at <<l'Ile de Re>> ---
an exquisite island on the Atlantic Ocean, in front of La Rochelle.

The seaside setting will certainly provide lots of opportunities
for informal discussions and collaborations in the evenings.


GAME THEORY IN SEMANTICS AND VERIFICATION

The Spring School 2006 is designed for students and researchers interested
in learning more about Game Theory and its recent applications to
the Semantics and Verification of Programs and Programming Languages.

The Spring School offers the first international platform for discussing
together the recent advances in these two extremely active topics.

The Spring School is openly multi-disciplinary, and will also introduce
related topics such as Descriptive Set Theory in Mathematical Logic,
or Nash equilibrium in Economic Games.

Lectures will be provided ***in english*** by:

Samson Abramsky (Oxford, UK)
Jacques Duparc (Lausanne, Switzerland)
Paul Gastin (LSV, ENS Cachan)
Erich Gradel (Aachen, Germany)
Martin Hyland (Cambridge, UK)
Luke Ong (Oxford, UK)
Tristan Tomala (Ceremade, Paris Dauphine)
Igor Walukiewicz (Bordeaux)
Wieslaw Zielonka (Paris)

The program of the Spring School appears at:

REGISTRATION

We have done our best to limit the registration and accomodation fees
to the following amounts:

--- 250 euros for students in double rooms,
--- 500 euros for researchers in single rooms.


REGISTRATION

We have done our best to limit the registration and accomodation fees

This includes the (somptuous) accomodation, the (perfect) meals,
the coffee breaks, as well as a coach from La Rochelle to l'Ile de Re,
and return.


DEADLINES

An unexpected increase in our financial support enables us to accept
more participants than what was originally forecast. There remains
however only a very limited number of places. We thus ask that
interested people contact the organizers *directly* and *immediately*

Above I was reporting what David Madore wrote.  He indeed claims
that in ZF without C one cannot prove the uniqueness of the algebraic
closure of Q.  He also said some other interesting stuff, so I might
as well quote it verbatim:

John Baez in litteris <e13l06$sr9$1@glue.ucr.edu> scripsit:
> 1) Is there a way to enumerate the elements of Qbar such that

The usual manner is to represent a real element of Qbar by

* its minimal polynomial over Q (or perhaps, some polynomial, not
necessarily minimal, but probably at least separable, of which it is a
root),

* an interval which isolates the root from all other roots (or the
number of the root in the usual order on the reals).

Basically the trick is that sums and products can be computed by
universal rules (if P1 and P2 are polynomials over Q, there is a
polynomial, which can be given universally in function of the
coefficients of P1 and P2, whose roots are the sums of roots of P1 and
P2, and ditto for the product), and roots can always be isolated using
Sturm-Liouville (in other words, you can narrow the interval as much
as you want since Sturm-Liouville lets you count the number of roots
in any given interval).

This is for real algebraics; for the full Qbar, you just represent a
complex number by its real and imaginary parts (both of which are
algebraic if the complex is algebraic).

Actually programming this is *unbelievably* painful.  As for the
algorithmic complexity, I think it's not that bad, in the sense that
if x and y have small height (for any reasonable definition of
"height") then computing x+y can be done in a reasonable time, but
there's a catch: the height of x+y grows considerably larger than that
of x or y, so any actual computation can become terribly difficult.
(The same problem happens for rationals: computing r+s where r and s
are rationals is polynomial in the height of r and s, but try
computing something like 1/2+1/3+1/5+1/7+1/11+1/13+1/17...)

For some specific uses it is better to use the p-adics than the reals:
the advantage is that p-adic approximation is *much* easier than real
approximation (thanks to the ultrametric properties); the disadvantage
is that whereas the reals are "almost" algebraically closed, the
p-adics are quite far from it, and representing elements of the
algebraic closure of Q_p is again quite a nuisance.

> 2) On the other extreme: can we even prove the existence of Qbar

Yes, the *existence* of Qbar, or of any countable or even
well-orderable field (and various others, such as Q_p), can be shown
without the axiom of choice.  However, the *uniqueness* of Qbar
requires the axiom of choice: it is consistent in ZF alone that there
exists an uncountable algebraic closure of Q.  (Basically it's true in
ZFA because you can create atoms for elements of Qbar and let Galois
act on them and take the usual permutation model, and then some
embedding theorem gives the result in ZF.)  I'm not sure about whether
one needs AC to show that the algebraic closure of Q constructed using
the reals and the p-adics as explained above actually give the same
thing.

> 3) I've heard that it's even hard to get an "explicit" description
> of the algebraic closures of finite fields - are there any
> theorems to this effect?

I don't think it's hard.  In fact, here's a very elegant and
intriguing explicit construction of the algebraic closure of F_2,
which is due to Conway:

Define two binary operations, '#' and '@', on the class of ordinals,
by transfinite induction, by letting:

  x # y  =  mex ( { x'#y | x'<x } union { x#y' | y'<y } )

  x @ y  =  mex { (x'@y)#(x'@y')#(x@y') | x'<x and y'<y }

(respectively called the "Nim sum" and "Nim product" by Conway).

Then:

* the operation '#' coincides with the "exclusive or" on the binary
representation of ordinals (= unique representation as decreasing sum
of distinct powers of 2),

* the operations '#' and '@' make various ordinals (such as omega,
omega^omega, epsilon_0, omega_1, and in fact a closed unbounded class
of ordinals, or even "the class of all ordinals") into a field of
characteristic 2, which for some well-known ordinal (I think it is
omega^(omega^omega) or omega^omega or epsilon_0 or some such thing -
you can find the correct version in Conway's "On Numbers and Games")
is exactly the algebraic closure of F_2.  (As for omega, i.e., the set
of natural numbers, it is the quadratic closure of F_2, this one I'm
sure about.  Somewhere far beyond that we get the algebraic closure of
F_2(t), which is a much nastier beast than that of F_2, but I think
nobody knows exactly which ordinal that is - possibly the
Feferman-Schuette ordinal.)

This is as explicit as you might wish: there are no choices to be
made, everything is well-defined.  It is not too computational,
however, because in principle to compute x@y for two ordinals x and y
you need to know x'@y' for every pair (x',y') with x'<=x and y'<=y and
(at least one not being equal): in fact, it's not that bad, and at
least up to omega the Nim product ('@') can be computed fairly
efficiently, I don't know what about higher ordinals but I suspect it
is reasonalby well-behaved at least as far as defining the algebraic
closure of F_2 goes.

I hope this answers your question.

If memory serves me, Nerode proved years ago that the necessary and
sufficient condition that all the algebraic closures of a field are
effectively isomorphic is that its polynomials effectively factor into
irreducibles.

As for the later, the ancient theorem is that if a unique
factorization domain has only finitely many units and if the
factorization is effective then so it is for its polynomial ring.

The condition on units pretty much forces the proof.

Hi!

In 1978  Joyal gave a lecture in Montreal where he described  a
constructive construction  of the pithagorean closure (every a > 0 has a
square root > 0).

This he does with a beautifully  simple idea.

Assume K is ordered decidable (in particular   "=" is decidable)

Using M. Barr wording:

" Let me give an example of the flavor.  Suppose you want to have a square
root of a > 0.  It is decidable (by hypothesis) if a > 0; what may not be
decidable is whether a has a square root."

Joyal simply construct the ring A = K[x]/(x^2  - a) = K[s] with s^2 = a.
He then considers an equivalence relation  in A:

Consider

J = {x + ys | x = 0, y = 0  or  not(y = 0), -x/y > 0, (-x/y)^2 = a}

the relation  "\in  J" is decidable,  then if J is an ideal, the quotient
by J will also have "=" decidable.

J = {0} precisely if a does not have an square root in K,

but it can be shown that J is an ideal without having to decide if a has
or not a square root !!

Furthermore, it can be shown (with some but not too much work) that the
quotient  K[s]/J  is a order decidable field.

This field is the solution to the universal problem of adding to K an
square root of a, and it is obtained  without the use of Gauss theorem  !!

(Notice that for non-ordered fields, the universal solution of adding a
square root of a when a already has a square root DOES NOT EXIST (it is
not given by K itself), while for ordered fields the solution of adding a
positive square root does exist, and it is K itself)

Algorithms for K[s]/J are easily obtained from the algorhitms for K !!

We can iterate this, and then construct the filtered colimit.  This
filtered colimit is the pithagorean closure, and by construction of
filtered colimits  a rather simple description of its elements  is there.
Also algorithms for this colimit are rather easily obtained.

All this is considerably simpler than other methods quoted in this
thread, and certainly  not " *unbelievably* painful".  Actually, I believe
it could be possible to write with reaonable trouble an actual  computer
program to calculate in the pithagorean closure of the rationals.

I have an article written with an student for a journal on math teaching
("revista de educacion matematica" of the UMA, Union Matematica Argentina)
with details of all this. The text is in spanish, in a .pdf file, and
I will be happy to send it on request

I do not know if Joyal had also a continuation of this story, meaning how
to keep adding more roots  without Gauss's theorem.

e.d.

A bit of confusion occured when I tried to post a corrected version of the
above (all due to myself), so here goes.

I retract the statement in ** ** above - what I meant was G/H with a badly
behaved topological/differentiable quotient (H normal in G) and I was after
examples not connected with gerbes/crossed modules but something more
`interesting' than group quotients.

John's post was interesting,  but a couple of things bother me.  Since
there are explicit enumerations of Q[x] and you can order the roots of any
polynomial by their order and adjoin the roots in order, how can you get
an uncountable closure?

Another question (for Q, although any Archimedean field should work) what
if you use Cauchy sequences generated by Newton iteration, having isolated
the real roots using Sturm and sticking to an interval in which the
derivative is positive (I am thinking of a monic polynomial that is
increasing in the end)?

Incidentally, AC doesn't bother me at all, but constructive methods are
interesting in their own right.

David,

When you have `bad' quotients you can look at the equivalence relation, a
special case of a groupoid. In the case of subgroups H < G, then you also
get a covering groupoid G' \to G with vertex groups isomorphic to H.  If you
want more than one subgroup, you might need global actions or groupoid
atlases

http://www.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/public/mathematics/research/preprints/06/algtop06.html#06.02

Perhaps you can find `bad' quotients which nonetheless have `good' holonomy
groupoids, analogously to the foliation case? That would be good, but is it
too naive an idea? On the other hand, an irrational flow on a torus gives a
foliation of the torus which has a smooth holonomy groupoid.

see preprint 06.03  and the information there for some ideas on holonomy.

Dear Michael,

>Incidentally, AC doesn't bother me at all, but constructive methods are
>interesting in their own right.

Constructive methods are sometimes more than "just interesting in their own
right". If a certain theorem expressible in geometric logic can be proved
constructibly, then it is true in any topos, and so amenable to a variety of
interesting interpretations. I return to one of the examples I mentioned
from my paper ("Sheaves and prime model extensions", J. Algebra 68, 1981) to
illustrate how it works for the real closure, which has both a constructive
and a non-constructive part.


Preamble. The following theorem has been shown (Lipshitz, Trans AMS 211,
1975; van der Dries Ann. Math. 12, 1977) in order to solve the analogue of
Hilbert's 17th problem for commutative (von Neumann) regular f-rings.

Theorem. Any commutative regular f-ring has an atomless real closure.

Using the Pierce representation of any commutative (von Neumann) regular
f-ring R by an ordered field K in the (non-Boolean) topos E of sheaves on
the spectrum of K, the above theorem can be shown more easily than in the
above quoted sources, simply using the analogue for ordered fields, with
some care, since we know that, although there is an algorithm for
constructing the "real closure" of an ordered field, this does not
automatically give that such is real closed. This is how I proceed, using
the "mid-way house" method.

The inclusion F = E_{not not} >---> E factors through the Gleason cover
g:G--->E (g a surjection) via a flat inclusion i: F >---> G. Since F is a
BVM/ST, i^*g^*K >---> K' has a real closure. Thus, since i_* preserves
finitary logic, g^*K >---> i_*K' is an extension of g^*K into a real
closed field i_*K'. Sturm's theorem gives an algorithm which makes sense
in any topos, provided the ordered field one applies it to is already
contained in some real closed field.  From this follows first that g^*K
has a real closure in G, and then, by the surjectivity of g (g^*
faithful), follows that K has a real closure in E. By "transfer", the
commutative regular f-ring R ( R = \Gamma (K)) has a real closure (in
Sets).

Other results (including classically new ones) in the case of differential
rings are proved in that paper. Sheaf methods in the theory of commutative
rings are very useful in classical mathematics. See for instance "Recent
Advances in the Representation Theory of Rings and C*-Algebras by Continuous
Sections", Memoirs AMS 148, 1973. In particular, C. Mulvey, "Intuitionistic
Algebra and Representation of Rings" in that volume). Another source is
"Applications of Sheaves" (Proceedings Durham 1977), LNM 753, Springer 1977.
In particular, the papers by Fourman and Hyland, Fourman and D. Scott, and
C. Rousseau. Anyway, this is a huge subject and hints at the usefulness  of
constructive methods in algebra and analysis, when available.

Anhyway, trhis is old stuff.

Best,
Marta

You are right; without choice we should be careful, and several classicall=
y equal
things become distinct. I am used to the following way of defining the pol=
ynomial ring
over a ring A in variables x(s) for all s from a given set S: Monomials ar=
e maps from
S to the set of nonnegative integers, which map all but finitely many elem=
ents to 0.
The images under this map are considered as exponents, and monomials are
multiplied by adding the exponents, and x(s) is the monomial that maps s t=
o 1 and all
other elements to 0. Then x(s)x(t) is literally the same as x(t)x(s). Anal=
ogously, we
can define polynomials as maps from the set of all monomials to A, which a=
re 0
almost every where; the images are interpreted as coefficients. Then we al=
so have
x(s)+x(t)=3Dx(t)+x(s).

However, also another definition should turm the polynomial ring into a co=
mmutative
rings; so the elements could also be defined as equivalence classes of (fi=
rst-order)
terms. The point is that x(s)x(t) should bet taken as an element of the (c=
ommutative)
polynomial ring, not as a term; the terms x(s)x(t)and x(t)x(s) are indeed =
different.

The algebraic closure of Q (or of a finite field) can be constructed by su=
ccessively
adding zeros of polynomials. Since the set of all polynomials can be numbe=
red, an
isomorphism between two different algebraic closures can be found, if on e=
ach step
we find a bijection between the finte sets of zeros of a given polynomials=
 in both
closures. This choice usually depends on the privious choices; so countabl=
e
dependent choice in finite sets (or K=F6nig's Lemma) should render the des=
ired
isomorphism. On the other hand, the situation is very specific, I do not s=
ee how
K=F6nig's Lemma should follow from the existence of isomorphism between al=
gebraic
closures of Q.

So I considered an easier case: The choices of square roots of different p=
rimes are
independent. So the isomorphism between K and K' in my example can be obta=
ined
uniquely if for every prime you have bijectin between the set of the two s=
quare roots
of a prime p in K and the set of the square roots of p in K'. ButK is orde=
red by
construction; so you obtain the bijection if fir each p you choose which o=
ne of the two
square roots of p shall be mapped to the positive square root in K': If yo=
u have the
isomorphism, you get an ordering of K'  and therefore a choice of positive=
 square
roots. So had to build the field K' for a given sequence of two-element se=
ts without
using a choice for these sets.

Of course the result is not satifactory; it was just my first idea when I =
read John Baez'
mail. Since there are also irreducible polynomials of degrees >2, I think =
that the sock
axiom (i.e. countable choise for sequences of two-element sets, i.e. choos=
ing a left
one for countably many pairs of symmetric socks) should not imply the uniq=
ueness of
the algebraic closure of Q up to isomorphism. In order to getthe converse,=
 we should
need a way to extend an isomporphism between K and K' to an isomorphism
between algebraic closures without using choice again.

Hi everybody,

I haven't been reading this list for a while but now I have a
question people on categories may have thought about. May be
trivial... apologies in advance.

A strict monoidal category is a monoidal one where all the isos are
indentities, e.g. we have that A(x)(B(x)C) = (A(x)B)(x)C and also
f(x)(g(x)h) = (f(x)g)(x)H because the natural iso is the identity. A
nice example is the skeletal cat of finite sets, i.e. objects are
natural numbers and Hom m n = {i<m} -> {i<n}. This cat is even
strictly bimonoidal with + and *. However, even though both operators
are symmetric and A(x)B = B(x)A we don't have f(x)g = g(x) f - hence
I wouldn't call this one strictly symmetric monoidal.

Are there any (constructive) examples of non-trivial strict symmetric
monoidal cats?

I am thinking about reversible computations and quantum, btw.

Cheers,
Thorsten

  Uncaging big opportunities in corner shops

  A just-in-time delivery service for convenience stores has hit profitability
  at a pounds 133m turnover.

  So what next, asks Philip Smith?

BYLINE: PHILIP SMITH

BODY:

ARMED with a doctorate in mathematical logic and theoretical computing,
backed by years of experience as a management consultant in the retail sector,
Douglas Gurr set out to devise a system that would allow convenience stores to
benefit from the same buying power, stock rotation and low pricing as the major
supermarkets.

He found the right formula. His Blueheath Holdings has grown from zero to a
pounds 133m turnover business in six years.

The challenge for Dr Gurr, 41, is how to maintain that growth and reach his
target of pounds 1bn. He also needs to consider whether the Blueheath blueprint
can be replicated across other sectors or in other countries.

What intrigued Dr Gurr was how small, independent grocery stores got their
supplies and, crucially, how they could compete against the big names.

"There were two options: either they went to traditional cash-and-carry
wholesalers and physically brought back thousand of pounds worth of stock, or
they paid extra for a delivery.

''The first ate into their time, the second into the bottom line. We thought
we could take enough costs out of the system to be able to offer all the
benefits of a delivered service but at a cash-and-carry price,'' he says.

Blueheath keeps its costs down by using technology: its system predicts what
stock will be wanted by its customers.

That, says Dr Gurr, is based on a range of parameters, including fashions,
bank holidays, weather and a customer's own stock levels. Blueheath then orders
from suppliers in anticipation of the orders that it will get from its array of
shopkeeper customers. This allows the company to keep stock levels low but
fulfilment levels high.

Fulfilment, which runs at around 95pc in the industry, says Dr Gurr, is the
level at which a customer's order is actually delivered at the store. The
missing products are mainly due to the wholesaler being out of stock. "We
operate at 98pc fulfilment,'' he says. "We live or die by our fulfilment and
on-time delivery percentages. If you get those right, most of the rest follows.'
'

Predictive ordering also means that stock remains with Blueheath for a much
shorter time, allowing it to service the whole of the UK from three depots: in
east London, the Midlands and Wales.

Blueheath has its own fleet of trucks but the bulk of its deliveries are made
using spare capacity in established hauliers. That, along with a policy to lease
its buildings, means that the Islington-based business is light on capital
assets.

Blueheath was formed in 2000 as a regional operation, allowing it to develop
a model on which it could raise funds for a UK rollout.

Two rounds of venture capital funding were followed in 2004 by a listing on
Aim. The two initial main funders remain principal shareholders. Its
slower-than- expected path to profitability hit its share price, which halved to
around 58p. This year Dr Gurr expects Blueheath to turn an operational profit
for the first time. It is the scalability of the system that allows the business
to look at much higher margins in the future.

"This is a scalable business,'' he says. "Scale allows you to get better
buying terms, operational improvements and, because the majority of costs are
fixed, improved profitability. We are now at the stage where we have reached the
scale to become profitable. It's taken a while to get here but it doesn't work
as a business until you reach the kind of levels we have.''

Blueheath currently has 4,000 regular customers, serviced by 200 staff,
mostly in sales and fulfilment.

Continued growth is what Blueheath needs. The sector is worth pounds 17.5bn,
of which the largest players account for pounds 2bn to pounds 3bn each. "The
bigger we can get it, the better it will work. There is no reason why this
shouldn't be a pounds 1bn-turnover business,'' he says.''

Growth would be self-funding but Dr Gurr is adamant that the company will not
advertise. "We have never spent a penny on advertising and as long as I'm here
we never shall. It's not an appropriate use of funds,'' says Dr Gurr.

Blueheath Holdings was the overall national winner in last year's
DTI/Interforum E-Commerce Awards.

Chris Jackson

Head of finance and management faculty, Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England & Wales

BLUEHEATH'S best growth strategy is market penetration, to grow turnover by
finding more of the same. The largest two players control 29pc of the sector,
leaving the remainder fragmented among smaller players. Sales effort here should
focus on Blueheath's superior fulfilment and better pricing (the larger
competitors are likely to be able to beat Blueheath on price through economies
of scale). This strategy maximises return from the current infrastructure. It is
also a low-risk strategy compared with alternatives such as licensing or
entering foreign markets, which would take Blueheath outside its expertise.

Word of mouth will not suffice and advertising is probably not the answer. In
the business-to-business sector, direct marketing is the solution. There will be
data for sale to assist with identifying the best prospects, which the sales
force could then target.John Timpson

Chairman, Timpson

IN ONLY six years Blueheath has acquired 4,000 customers and a pounds l33m
turnover, but it hasn't made any money.

It is time for Douglas Gurr to stop living the dream of his business plan and
face up to reality.

Dr Gurr puts his faith in economies of scale but it may not be so easy to
find the extra customers that he anticipates.

A safer route would be to create profit from the existing business. He needs
to increase margins and that probably means putting up prices. If customers feel
that the Blueheath service is helping them to make more money they will be
willing to pay a proper price.

There is more to business than mathematical logic. In today's technological
age, wizard computer solutions are taken for granted - it's old fashioned flair
and the personal touch that make the difference between success and failure.

Ultimately, profits always depend on people.

Dr Gurr should visit as many shops as possible and talk to his customers face
to face. They will tell him all that he needs to know.Amanda Rendle

Head of business marketing, HSBC

ADVERTISING can play a role in creating awareness but there are other
marketing techniques Blueheath could use to keep its profile high. For example,
using customer testimonials and case studies would deliver the controlled growth
Douglas Gurr requires. These approaches should be used primarily via the
internet. Word of mouth is also highly effective; both customers and sales teams
have a role to play here. By offering a reward scheme - money off or something
more tangible - many customers will gladly tell their colleagues about Blueheath
's price and service levels. Customers who make recommendations tend to do so
many times - it will only take a few endorsements to magnify the Blueheath
message. The sales force should also be ambassadors for the company, both by
making sales and by talking about the way that Blueheath operates - emphasising
the cultural aspects of the business and describing how they can be a benefit

*******************************************************************
                        FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS
       International Workshop on Hybrid Logic 2006 (HyLo 2006)
                       Affiliated with LICS 2006
                    August 11, 2006, Seattle, USA
*******************************************************************

AIMS AND SCOPE:

Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic in which it is possible to
directly refer to worlds/times/states or whatever the elements of
the (Kripke) model are meant to represent. Although they date back
to the late 1960s, and have been sporadically investigated ever
since, it is only in the 1990s that work on them really got into
its stride.

It is easy to justify interest in hybrid logic on applied grounds,
because of the usefulness of the additional expressive power.
For example, when reasoning about time one often wants to build
up a series of assertions about what happens at a particular
instant,and standard modal formalisms do not allow this. What is
less obvious is that the route hybrid logic takes to overcome
this problem (the basic mechanism being to add nominals ---
atomic symbols true at a unique point --- together with extra
modalities to exploit them) often actually improves the behavior
of the underlying modal formalism. For example, it becomes far
simpler to formulate modal tableau, resolution, and natural
deduction in hybrid logic, and completeness and interpolation
results can be proved of a generality that is not available in
orthodox modal logic.

Hybrid logic is now a mature field, therefore a theme of special
interest at this HyLo workshop will be the combination of hybrid
logic with other logics, the basic methodological question being
"what is the best way of hybridizing a given logic?" However,
submissions in all areas of hybrid logic are welcome.

The workshop HyLo 2006 is likely to be relevant to a wide range of
people, including those interested in description logic, feature
logic, applied modal logics, temporal logic, and labelled
deduction. The workshop continues a series of previous workshops
on hybrid logic, for example the LICS-affiliated HyLo 2002
(http://floc02.diku.dk/HYLO) which was held as part of FLoC 2002,
Copenhagen, Denmark. If you are unsure whether your work is of

Depends what you mean by topological. In the category of locales, regular
epis aren't closed under composition (equivalently, regular monos aren't
closed under composition in frames): this was proved by Till Plewe, and
is in his paper `Quotient maps of locales' in Appl. Cat. Struct. 8 (2000),
17--44. Another `natural' example (which I regularly use when teaching
category theory to graduate students) is regular epis in Cat.

Dear category theorists,

if you don't mind, I'd like to mention a naive observation.

Attention of physicists, like myself, has recently been drawn to the
geometric Langlands conjecture - since E. Witten and A. Kapustin have
pointed out how it can be understood in terms of 2-dimensional topological
field theory.

Even after having been introduced to some basics, I hardly know anything
about geometric Langlands. But I believe I do understand some aspects of 2D
topological field theory.

In particular, I am fond of the general fact that where \C-modules (\C =3D =
the
complex numbers) appear in 1D quantum  field theory (quantum mechanics), we
see C-modules appear in 2D TFT, where now C is some abelian monoidal
category. In the most accessible cases of topological field theory we have =
C
=3D Vect.

Now, the 2-category (bicategory) Vect-Mod contains that of
Kapranov-Voevodsky 2-vector spaces, but is larger than that (isn't it?).

In general, it should make some sense to address objects in C-Mod (module
categories for C) as categorified vector spaces; and 1-morphisms in C-Mod a=
s
categorified linear maps between these.

Interestingly, when one studies 2D quantum field theory (topological or
conformal), one finds that boundary conditions of the theory (known as
"D-branes") are described by objects of objects of C-Mod, i.e. objects of
C-module categories. In the above terminology these would be like
categorified vectors.

Moreover, there are phenomena called "defect lines" or "disorder operators"
in 2D QFT. These are known to be described by 1-morphisms in C-Mod, i.e. by
categorified linear maps.

Therefore a "defect line" may be applied to a "D-brane", much like a linear
map may be applied to a vector.

The above analogy naturally motivates to contemplate the case where the
D-brane is an eigenvector under this action, i.e. where it is sent by the
action of the defect line to itself, up to tensoring with an element in C.

This might be nothing but a play with words. But, remarkably, Witten and
Kapustin point out that the Hecke eigensheaves appearing in the context of
geometric Langlands are precisely to be identified with certain D-branes
that are categorified eigenvectors of some defect line, in the above sense.

Of course, they do not say so using category theoretic terminology. They ar=
e
addressing an audience of physicists. At one point they apologize for
mentioning the term "functor" once.

Therefore I was wondering what people knowledgeable in (higher) category
theory would think of this. Does my observation make sense? (Of course I am
glossing over a couple of technical details.) If yes, has it been observed
before? Is it useful for anything?

I'd be grateful for any kind of comments.

Best regards,
Urs Schreiber

P.S.

As before on previous occasions, I have written up some informal notes with
slightly more details on what I have in mind here:

Hi -

> Now, the 2-category (bicategory) Vect-Mod contains that of
> Kapranov-Voevodsky 2-vector spaces, but is larger than that (isn't it?).

Yes.  Yetter's paper "Categorical Linear Algebra: a Setting for
Questions from Physics and Low-Dimensional Topology" characterizes
the Kapranov-Voevodsky 2-vector spaces among the Vect-modules.

(Here Vect stands for the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces
as a monoidal category with its usual tensor product.)

In Proposition 25, he says that the 2-category of 2-vector spaces
is isomorphic to the 2-category of "finitely semisimple" Vect-modules.
These are Vect-modules with a finite set of simple objects such that
every object is a finite direct sum of these.   We call this a "basis" of
simple objects.

(I would feel more comfortable if he had said these 2-categories were
2-equivalent, and this is all I really care about.)

There are a bunch of obvious Vect-modules that aren't 2-vector
spaces in Kapranov and Voevodsky's sense.

One is the category VECT of not-necessarily-finite-dimensional vector
spaces: not every object is a *finite* direct sum of copies of C.

Another is the category Vect^{infinity} for your favorite infinite
cardinal "infinity": the same problem, but for a different reason.

These counterexamples are a bit dull, in that one imagines there
could be some definition of an "infinite-dimensional" 2-vector
space that they might fit.  But, it seems that that there are two different
kinds of infinite-dimensionality at work here: VECT is "tall", while
Vect^{infinity} is "wide".  There's also VECT^{infinity}, which is
tall and wide.  So, somebody should straighten this stuff out.

Other counterexamples are neither "tall" nor "wide".  For example,
the category of finite-dimensional representations of a non-semisimple
algebra like the algebra of upper triangular matrices.  Or, the
category of representaions of a quiver.  (I think representations of
the A_n quiver are the same as representations of the algebra of
upper triangular matrices.)

I'd be interested to know if any of these sorts of counterexamples is
useful in Witten's work, or he can live with 2-vector spaces.

It makes sense to me!  Other mathematicians often respond better to
more precisely phrased questions.  :-)

> If yes, has it been observed before?

Not that I know of, but I could be missing examples from other
contexts.

Certainly category theorists think about "weak fixed points" of
endofunctors T: C -> C, that is, objects c in C equipped with
isomorphisms Tc -> c.  The category of all these weak fixed points
is something people enjoy studying: it's an example of a "weak
equalizer" and on a good day I know lots of examples.

You're asking about something more general: "weak eigenobjects" of
endofunctors T: C -> C on *monoidal* categories C.  In other words: objects
c in C equipped with isomorphisms Tc -> a tensor c for some fixed object
a.

I bet some people have studied these in some context or other.
You may have scared these people away with all your Langlands,
branes and defect lines.  Category theorists are dual to ordinary
people: they often get more confused when you surround an abstract
concept with a lot of distacting specifics.  "Could you please not
give me an example, to help me understand what you're saying?"  :-)

Best,
jb

Sorry!

Actually Urs is asking about an even more general situation.
A is a monoidal category, C is a category tensored over A,
T: C -> C, and we seek objects c in C equipped with isomorphisms
Tc -> a tensor c for some fixed object a.

We can form the category of these, which is the pseudo-equalizer
of T and a tensor -, and call it an "eigenspace of T".

For Urs, A = Vect and C is a Vect-module.

Best,
jb

I think what is needed in Witten's context is the following.

Fix some topological space X.

In the Witten/Langlands examples this is the moduli space X =3D Bun_G of
G-bundles over some complex curve. Hm, probably it has more structure than
just being topological. But anyway.

The relevant object of Vect-Mod (the relevant 2-vector space) is the
category of vector bundles over X.

Of course this is a slight lie. Really we want to be working with locally
free (coherent?) sheaves on X. But anyway.

So a 2-vector here is a vector bundle over X.

For Kaparanov-Voevodksy we would instead take X to be a finite set.

Next, the endomorphisms that are relevant are spans over X, i.e spaces with
two (possibly different) projections onto X. Certainly these "spaces" shoul=
d
carry some appropriate extra structure.

For the application to Langlands these spans are usually called Hecke_x .

We act with these spans on our 2-vectors (vector bundles) by pulling back
along one leg and pushing forward along the other.

For the Kaparanov-Voevodksy case our spans would be vector bundles with two
projections to some finite set,. i.e matrices whose entries are vector
spaces.

I am aware that the question is a little unspecific. The best thing about
this observation is that it fits so very nicely into the general picture
that is emerging in 2D QFT.


Actually Urs is asking about an even more general situation.

And, moreover, T is "A-linear". That's kind of important.

And that's where Hecke eigensheaves, and hence the corresponding "D-branes"=
,
should live in. I think.

Husband, father, mathematician, philosopher, pursuer of authenticity. Born Sept.
20, 1935, in Charlotte, N.C. Died Nov. 27, 2005, in Stratford, Ont., of a heart
attack, aged 70.

I always looked up to my uncle, William Hatcher. Truly, almost everyone who met
him looked up to him. At 6-foot-6, and with the physical size and booming voice
that betrayed his roots in the deep south of the United States, he was pretty
much always the largest presence wherever he found himself.

But for my uncle Bill, physical presence was merely the reflection of the other
ways in which he was a towering figure.

His mind was what made him most well-known. He brought an iron-clad precision
and clarity to the most ubiquitous, essential, and seemingly eternal questions
of human life. In his early 20s, he began contemplating a logical proof of the
existence of God. When he fully completed the proof some decades later, he
travelled over many years to universities across Canada, the United States, and
Europe, where he explicated the proof to packed audiences.

The logical proof was one of Bill's most characteristic achievements. It was the
perfect blending of the two passions of his mind science and religion.

A mathematician and philosopher at Universiti Laval for more than 30 years, he
was listed as one of the eight Platonist philosophers of the latter half of the
20th century in the respected Encylopidie Philosophique Universelle. His
contribution to the study of religion, and in particular the Baha'i faith a
subject on which he co-authored the seminal introductory text led him to be
recognized as one of the greatest scholars of Baha'i studies.

But it was uncle Bill's qualities of heart that I will remember most. He was
staunchly committed to the pursuit of authentic relationships and the principle
that love is expressed through self-sacrifice, service, altruism, and putting
others ahead of oneself. He captured this theme in his book Love, Power, and
Justice: The Dynamics of Authentic Morality. One time he said I should simply
look around me when walking down the street and reflect on my reaction to those
I saw. He was giving me a lesson about how to stay conscious of my own
prejudices, my own self-interested commitments which, he insisted, were
reflections of a failure to authentically love and relate to other human beings.
Uncle Bill constantly pursued authenticity in his own life, and strived to live
a life characterized by service to others. Of course, he sometimes failed, but
he often succeeded. Sometimes his actions took the form of grand gestures such
as moving to Russia at a dangerous time because there were contributions he
could make as the society emerged from the communist era. Other times it was in
the simple sweetness of how he always was prepared to listen to one's ideas,
share his thoughts, and encourage one to do better.

Like all high-achievers, Bill was constantly striving to do better. In the last
few years, he seemed to become a little doubtful of whether his myriad
accomplishments (raising three children with his wife Judith, training thousands
of young minds, publishing more than 50 books and articles, being a leader of
the Baha'i community of Canada and one of its leading scholars) were enough. To
those of us who knew him intimately and loved him dearly, it was hard to take
such insecurities seriously. My uncle Bill touched the hearts of thousands of
people, and helped educate, refine, and inspire their minds. The gifts he gave
others through his writings and teaching, and his acts of kindness, were more
than we could fairly expect from anybody. The gift he gave me was clear: Be
humble, strive as hard as you can, and be a lover of humanity. I will cherish
that gift forever.

  Roshan is William Hatcher's nephew.

                    Algebra, Meaning, and Computation:
           A Festschrift Symposium in Honor of Joseph Goguen


                         THIRD CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

        !!!URGENT: HOTEL ROOMS MUST BE BOOKED SOON!!!


 Joseph Goguen is one of the most prominent computer scientists
 worldwide.  His numerous research contributions span many topics and
 have changed the way we think about many concepts.  Our views about
 data types, programming languages, software specification and
 verification, computational behavior, logics in computer science,
 semiotics, interface design, multimedia, and consciousness, to
 mention just some of the areas, have all been enriched in fundamental
 ways by his ideas.

A Symposium to honor Joseph Goguen on his 65th birthday on June 28,
2006 will be held at the Computer Science and Engineering Department
of the University of California in San Diego (UCSD) in June 27-29
2006.  There will also be an IFIP WG1.3 meeting co-located with the
Symposium that will take place on June 30.  Leading researchers in the
different areas spanned by Joseph Goguen's work have contributed over
thirty papers to the Festschrift volume being published by
Springer-Verlag.  These papers will be presented at the Symposium in a
three full day programme.  A Symposium banquet is planned for June 28
to celebrate Joseph Goguen's 65th Birthday.  The Symposium organizers
welcome participation by any members of the scientific community who
would like to take part in this important event.

LOCAL INFORMATION AND VENUE

The UCSD Campus is located in La Jolla, on top of a spectacular mesa
overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  The Symposium, and also the IFIP WG1.3
meeting, will be held at UCSD's Computer Science Department.  The town
of La Jolla is one of the most beautiful in the California Coast.
Weather in June should be very pleasant, typically around 25 degrees
Celsius, mostly sunny but possibly with some morning coastal fog.

La Jolla is easy to reach from the San Diego Airport (see below).  All
major US airlines fly into San Diego from other main hubs like Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Washington DC, New York, Chicago, Dallas, and
so on.

The Festschrift Symposium in Honor of Joseph Goguen is being
hosted by the Jacobs School of Engineering's Department of Computer
Science and Engineering.  The meetings will be held in the Computer
Science and Engineering Building's main Auditorium, room 1202.

       International Workshop on Hybrid Logic 2006 (HyLo 2006)
                       Affiliated with LICS 2006
                    August 11, 2006, Seattle, USA
*******************************************************************

AIMS AND SCOPE:

Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic in which it is possible to
directly refer to worlds/times/states or whatever the elements of
the (Kripke) model are meant to represent. Although they date back
to the late 1960s, and have been sporadically investigated ever
since, it is only in the 1990s that work on them really got into
its stride.

It is easy to justify interest in hybrid logic on applied grounds,
because of the usefulness of the additional expressive power.
For example, when reasoning about time one often wants to build
up a series of assertions about what happens at a particular
instant,and standard modal formalisms do not allow this. What is
less obvious is that the route hybrid logic takes to overcome
this problem (the basic mechanism being to add nominals ---
atomic symbols true at a unique point --- together with extra
modalities to exploit them) often actually improves the behavior
of the underlying modal formalism. For example, it becomes far
simpler to formulate modal tableau, resolution, and natural
deduction in hybrid logic, and completeness and interpolation
results can be proved of a generality that is not available in
orthodox modal logic.

Hybrid logic is now a mature field, therefore a theme of special
interest at this HyLo workshop will be the combination of hybrid
logic with other logics, the basic methodological question being
"what is the best way of hybridizing a given logic?" However,
submissions in all areas of hybrid logic are welcome.

The workshop HyLo 2006 is likely to be relevant to a wide range of
people, including those interested in description logic, feature
logic, applied modal logics, temporal logic, and labelled
deduction. The workshop continues a series of previous workshops
on hybrid logic, for example the LICS-affiliated HyLo 2002
(http://floc02.diku.dk/HYLO) which was held as part of FLoC 2002,
Copenhagen, Denmark. If you are unsure whether your work is of

up in physics.  You won't learn any category theory here.  If you
want details, there are links to some papers.

Higher-dimensional algebra: a language for quantum spacetime

Category theory is a general language for describing things and processes -
called "objects" and "morphisms".  In this language, the counterintuitive
features of quantum theory turn out to be properties that the category of
Hilbert spaces shares with the category of cobordisms - in which objects
are choices of "space", and morphisms are choices of "spacetime". The
striking similarities between these categories suggests that "n-categories
with duals" are a promising framework for a quantum theory of spacetime.
We sketch the historical development of these ideas from Feynman diagrams,
to string theory, topological quantum field theory, spin networks and
spin foams, and especially recent work on open-closed string theory,
quantum gravity coupled to point particles, and 4d BF theory coupled to
strings.

Is there an introduction to CONTINUOUS LATTICES  written specifically
for (and ideally BY) real analysts?

(completely unrelated:)

Is there a word for a (necessarily compact) space X for which the
unique map  X --> 1  is a proper surjection?    Maybe "occupied"?

In the latter question, you may interpret "space" in any appropriate
sense, for example to mean locale or topos or ASD object or formal
space, or whatever you like.

PS  See you all in Canada (Calgary & Nova Scotia) in June.

I have put some preprints on

http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/brownpr.html

1. Normalisation for the fundamental crossed complex of a simplicial
set. R. Brown and R. Sivera=20

This is but one more step in setting up crossed complexes as a basic
somewhat nonabelian tool in algebraic topology.
It shows how crossed complexes are used to express the homotopy addition
lemma, and gives an analogue of a theorem classical for simplicial
abelian groups.

2. Analogy, concepts and methodology in Mathematics. R. Brown and T. Porter

This is an an article for undergraduates to appear in Eureka, Journal of
the Archimideans at Cambridge. It is about rather than on mathematics.
It includes two quotations from a correspondence with Grothendieck. It
could be seen as relevant to the article `Mathematical Morality' by
Eugenia Cheng.

Other Bangor preprints are on
