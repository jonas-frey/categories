             Preliminary Announcement-Octoberfest 2006
             +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


The Category Theory Octoberfest has been a great tradition among category
theorists for several decades now. For the second consecutive year, it
will be held at the University of Ottawa. It will be hosted by the Logic
and Foundations of Computing group (LFC). See our website at
www.site.uottawa.ca/~phil/lfc/. The conference will be held on the weekend
of October 21st and 22nd. A webpage for the conference will be available
shortly.

We will be asking for submissions for talks in early September.
But we wanted to give people information on lodging now, as
Ottawa can be busy that time of year. We have booked a block of rooms
at:

Quality Hotel Downtown Ottawa
290 Rideau Street
Ottawa, ON K1N 5Y3
(P) 613-789-7511

These rooms are held for Friday and Saturday nights. The
group number is 105626 and the group name is "Ottawa U-Math Dept".

The rate is $99.00 plus tax. Guests may
phone the hotel directly at 613-789-7511 to reserve and may
quote either the group name or number to get the preferred
rate. The cutoff for this special rate is September 20th,
but we strongly advise you not to wait that long.

PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC

        84th meeting - first announcement

Dear Colleagues,

The 84th meeting of the seminar will be held at the Department of
Theoretical Computer Science of the Technical University Braunschweig,
Germany, over the weekend of October 14-15, 2006.  As always, he
seminar welcomes talks using or addressing category theory or logic,
either explicitly or implicitly, in the study of any aspect of
mathematics or science.

Following the positive experience at PSSL83 in Glasgow earlier this
year, Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke have agreed to jointly give a
three talk overview of recent developments in the categorical approach
to quantum informatics.  We hope that professor Reinhard Werner,
mathematical physicist at the TU Braunschweig with special interest in
quantum informatics, can be present as well.

Braunschweig is located about 60 km East of Hannover and about 200 km
West of Berlin.  It can easily be reached by car or train.  The
closest airport is in Hannover; the airport bus to the Hannover train
station takes about 20 minutes, and the train from there to
Braunschweig takes about 40 minutes or less.

Further information on the location of the seminar, along with details
on local travel and accommodation together with an online registration
form can be found at

Dear Colleagues,

The pictures I took at CT2006 in White Point now are online.  The
numbers keep growing at each conference... ;-)

As usual, if someone doesn't like her or his picture, I'll take it off.
Also, if someone needs a larger file for a print or other purpose, just
just let me know.  I'll be happy to send you larger files.  If you
want to copy pictures off the web-page, be sure to add the extension
".jpg" manually!

There are some people I have not been able to identify; any help is
appreciated.  Also, I don't know the first names of various significant
others that appear on pictures shot during the dinner, nor do I know
the exact status of the relationship.  Using first and last names might
get around that issue...  Also, I apologize in case I have misspellt
someone's name.

Best regards,

Dear category theorists,

Here's something that I don't understand.  People sometimes talk about
algebraic structures "satisfying laws".  E.g. let's take groups.  Being
abelian is a law; it says that the equation xy = yx holds.  A group G
"satisfies no laws" if

    whenever X is a set and w, w' are distinct elements of the free
    group F(X) on X, there exists a homomorphism f: F(X) ---> G
    such that f(w) and f(w') are distinct.

For example, an abelian group cannot satisfy no laws, since you could take
X = {x, y}, w = xy, and w' = yx.  There are various interesting examples
of groups that satisfy no laws.

To be rather concrete about it, you could define a "law satisfied by G" to
be a triple (X, w, w') consisting of a set X and elements w, w' of F(X),
such that every homomorphism F(X) ---> G sends w and w' to the same thing.
 A law is "trivial" if w = w'.  Then "satisfies no laws" means "satisfies
only trivial laws".

You could then say: given a group G, consider the groups that satisfy all
the laws satisfied by G.  (E.g. if G is abelian then all such groups will
be abelian.)  This is going to be a new algebraic theory.

What bothers me is that I feel there must be some categorical story I'm
missing here.  Everything above is very concrete; for instance, it's
heavily set-based.  What's known about all this?  In particular, what's
known about the process described in the previous paragraph, whereby any
theory T and  T-algebra G give rise to a new theory?

Thanks,
Tom

About the WG 2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The IFIP Working Group 2.2 was established in 1965 as one of the
first IFIP Working Groups. The primary aim of the WG is to explain
programming concepts through the development, examination and
comparison of various formal models of these concepts. The WG thus
explores the theory and the practice of formal methods for the
specification, verification and the design of software and systems.

Earliest members of the WG included Dana Scott, Erwin Engeler, Jaco
de Bakker, Raymond Abrial, Peter Lauer, Manfred Paul, Erich Neuhold,
Maurice Nivat, Ed Blum. Throughout the years, members of the WG
shaped various styles of semantics, comprising denotational,
operational, algebraic, and logical semantics.

About the meeting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The anniversary meeting commemorates the 40-th birthday of WG. In the
meeting, a number of keynote speakers and current members of the WG
will give tutorial presentations on topics relevant to the WG,
focusing on history (of these topics, or of the WG), but also on
current outlook and future developments.

Keynote speakers: Amir Pnueli, Igor Walukiewicz, and Ernst-Rudiger
Olderog (as current WG members), Dana Scott, Manfred Paul, and Hans
Langmaack (as founding WG members), Leslie Lamport and Gordon Plotkin
(as past WG members) .

Dear Tom,

"Any theory"?...

If it is about Lawvere theories, we go back to classical universal algebra:

Let V be a variety of universal algebras, X be a fixed infinite set and F(X)
the free algebra on X. A pair (w,w') holds in an algebra A in V if, for
every map f : X ---> A, the induced homomorphism f* : F(X) ---> A makes
f*(w) = f*(w'); and in this case we write A |= (w,w'). Thus |= becomes a
relation between V and F(X)xF(X) (where x is used as the cartesian product
symbol). As every relation does, |= determines a Galois connection between
the subsets in V and the subsets in F(X)xF(X). Galois closed subsets in V
are exactly subvarieties (by definition), and Galois closed subsets in
F(X)xF(X) are called algebraic theories.

Now, as every universal-algebraist knows, every algebra A in V has its
theory T(A) - the one corresponding to the subvariety <A> in V generated by
A. By a classical theorem, due to Garrett Birkhoff, <A> is the smallest
subclass in V containing A and closed under products, subalgebras, and
quotients. Moreover, there is also a well-known completeness theorem for
algebraic logic, according to which T(A) can be described directly (i.e.
without using any algebras other then A and F(X); in the language of
universal algebra it is the fully invariant congruence on F(X) generated by
the intersection of all congruences determined by homomorphisms F(X) --->
A).

If we now move from classical universal algebra to the more elegant language
of Lawvere theories, and begin with such a theory T, then it is better not
to fix X and instead of the pairs (w,w') above talk about pairs of parallel
morphisms in T - and the story above can be easily modified accordingly. And
in the new story T(A) is in fact not set-based anymore:

Indeed, if C is a category with finite products, A an internal T-algebra in
C, and (t,t') a pair of parallel morphisms in T, then A |= (t,t') should be
understood as A(t) = A(t') (elegant indeed!). And then T(A) can be defined
as "the largest quotient theory" of T obtained by making t = t' whenever A
|= (t,t'). The only thing to have in mind is that not every C is "good
enough" to get the "C-completeness" theorem.

Moving further from Lawvere theories to other kinds of theories, we will
only need to know if "the largest quotient theory" does exist. On the other
hand, moving back to, say, classical (non-categorical) first order logic, we
are in the well known situation again: if T is a first order theory and A a
model of T, everybody knows what is the elementary theory of A. What I do
not know is if anyone ever considered any kind of logic (categorical or not)
where one cannot do this. I think Michael Makkai is the right person to be
asked.

Best regards,
George

The following seems so obvious that I suspect it's not what Tom is
really asking for; but it seems to me to be an answer to his
question. A law in Tom's sense is just a parallel pair of arrows
F(X) \rightrightarrows F(1) in the algebraic theory T under
consideration (thinking of T as the dual of the category of
finitely-generated free algebras). To get the theory of algebras
satisfying a given set S of laws, you just need to construct the
product-respecting congruence on T generated by S (i.e., the usual
closure conditions for a congruence, plus the condition that
f ~ f' and g ~ g' imply f x g ~ f' x g'), and factor out by it.

Now any T-algebra A (in a category C, say) corresponds to a product-
preserving functor F: T --> C; and the set of laws satisfied by A
is just the (necessarily product-respecting) congruence generated
by F, i.e. the set of parallel pairs in T having the same image
under F. Is there anything more to it than that?

To respond to Leinster's inquiry,

"Laws" (or "equations"), as the set-based universal
algebraists understand them, are ordered pairs of
members of free algebras (i.e., pairs e = (e_1, e_2)
in F x F, for F an algebra free on some set of "free
generators."

Actually, far more often than not, the variety of
algebras these F are free in is presented by means
of operations only, and the F are then called
"absolutely free."

A given equation e "holds" in an algebra A with the
given operations iff under each homomorphism from F
to A the elements e_1 and e_2 of F are shipped to
some same value in A.

>From this perspective the Abelianness equation xy=yx
is the pair (xy, yx) in F2 x F2 (F2 denoting the
absolutely free algebra on the two free generators
x & y based on, say, three operations, one binary
(multiplication), one unary (inversion), one nullary
(choice of base point).

The associativity equation x(yz) = (xy)z is another
equation in this sense.

One need not, of course, insist dogmatically on
taking as equations ONLY pairs in absolutely free
algebras: no harm in considering pairs in free
algebras of any variety. Thus, for example,
(xy, yx) is still a reasonable equation for groups.
But (x(yz), (xy)z) doesn't do what you think:
the RHS and LHS are ALREADY equal in every group,
and the pair is simply the diagonal entry (xyz, xyz)
(the INTENDED associativity is already a FACT for
groups, not, like commutativity, a condition that,
capable of failing, may meaningfully be imposed).

If these comments don't fully address the concerns raised,
please let me know. In any event, the laws most UAers
speak of refer to equations in absolutely free algebras
coming from the "lawless" variety whose algebras use the
same operations as another variety one is more interested
in, but are subject to the imposition of no equations
at all.

Hi Tom,

a lot is known about this. I will leave it to more qualified others to
give the category-theoretic account.  In set-like language, the answer
to your question is provided by universal algebra.

Denote by Th(G) the theory associated to a particular algebra G (over
a given signature). More generally, to a class of algebras S (all over
the same, from now on fixed, signature), associate Th(S), the theory
of all those equations satisfied by all the algebras in S.  Also, to a
given theory T, let V(T) be the class of all algebras satisfying the
equations in T (also called a variety of algebras).

Birkhoff's HSP theorem states that a class C of algebras is of the
form V(T), for some T, if and only if C is closed under isomorphism,
and under the operations of taking quotient algebras, subalgebras, and
cartesian products. (HSP stands for "homomorphic image, subalgebra,
product").

As a direct consequence, let C=V(Th(G)), the class of all groups
satisfying those equations that a particular group G satisfies. Then C
is precisely the class of groups that can be obtained, up to
isomorphism, from G by repeatedly taking quotients, subalgebras, and
cartesian products. [Proof: certainly, the right-hand side is
contained in C.  Conversely, by the HSP theorem, the right-hand side
class is of the form V(T), for some T.  Since G is in the class, T can
only contain equations that hold in G, thus T is a subset of Th(G). By
contravariance of the "V" operation, it follows that C=V(Th(G)) is a
subset of V(T)].

Moreover, since a subalgebra of a quotient is a quotient of a
subalgebra, and a cartesian product of quotients [subalgebras] is a
quotient [subalgebra] of a cartesian product, the three HSP operations
can be taken in this particular order: Thus, a group satisfies all the
equations that G satisfies, if and only if it is isomorphic to a
quotient of a subalgebra of some (possibly infinite) product G x ... x G.

There are generalizations to properties other than equational ones,
but I don't remember them as well. A "Horn clause" is an implication
between equations, or more precisely a property of the form (forall
x1...xn)(P1 and ... and Pn => Q), where P1,...,Pn,Q are equations.  Of
course, every equation is trivially a Horn clause (for n=0), but not
the other way around. A typical example of a Horn clause is cancellability,
the property xz=yz => x=y. (This holds in groups, but not in monoids,
and cannot be expressed equationally in monoids, because it is not
preserved under quotients).

If you want to consider the class of algebras (in general smaller than
V(Th(G))) that satisfy all the Horn clauses that G satisfies, then you
have to drop the homomorphic images. I believe that the algebras in
question will be precisely the subalgebras of products of G, but
someone might correct me if I remember this wrongly.

Thanks very much to the many people who provided helpful, expert replies.

To recap, I asked (among other things): given an algebra A for some
theory, what can be said about the algebras obeying all the equational
laws that A obeys?

The question was posed in the context of finitary algebraic theories, and
in that context, there's a straightforward description of such algebras:
they are exactly the quotients of subalgebras of (possibly infinite)
powers of A.  As explained by Peter Selinger and George Janelidze, this
comes from Birkhoff's Theorem.

I wanted to understand this particular situation - finitary algebraic
theories and their equational laws - and I do understand it better than I
did before.  However, what I ultimately want to understand is something
slightly different and more general, which I'll now describe.

This will take a while, so I'll start with the punchline: we get some very
simple universal characterizations of some quite sophisticated objects.
For example, we'll get a characterization of the Stone spaces among all
topological spaces, and a construction of the space of Borel probability
measures on a compact space.

Here goes.  Take an algebraic theory and write F for the free algebra
functor.  Any equational law w = w' in a set X of variables generates a
congruence ~ on FX (identify w and w'), hence a quotient map

e: FX ---> (FX)/~.

An algebra A obeys this law iff e is orthogonal to A, i.e. every map FX
---> A factors uniquely through e.

All such maps e encoding laws are regular epi (and more besides).
However, let's consider *all* maps whose domain is a free object.  I also
want to consider all adjunctions, not just those arising from an algebraic
theory - although they will provide important examples.

So the general set-up is this.  Fix an adjunction U: D ---> C, F: C ---> D
(F left adjoint to U).  A *law* is an arrow e: FX ---> E where X is in C
and E is in D.  An object A of D *obeys* the law e if e is orthogonal to
A.  An object B of D is *A-complete* if B obeys every law that A obeys.
The *A-completion* B[A] of B is the free A-complete object on B, assuming
it exists.

Note that "law" now means something more general than it did before; we're
no longer just interested in *equational* laws.  For instance, if the
adjunction is the usual one between D = Group and C = Set,
torsion-freeness is defined by laws, whereas it's not defined by
equational laws (is it?).  Indeed, a group is torsion-free iff it obeys
the law 1 ---> Z/pZ for every prime p.

Examples (without proofs):

1. Take C = D = Set and the identity adjunction.  Write n for an n-element
set.  The 0-complete objects are 0 and 1.  The only 1-complete object is
1.  If |A| > 1 then every set is A-complete, since A obeys "no laws" (i.e.
only those laws that are isomorphisms).

(If we were just using equational laws then 0 would be 1-complete too.)

2. Take the usual adjunction between D = abelian groups and C = sets.  Let
k be either the field of rational numbers or the field of p elements for
some prime p; these fields have the property that an abelian group can be
a k-vector space in at most one way.  Then an abelian group is k-complete
iff it is a k-vector space.

3. Take D to be a v-semilattice and C to be the terminal category.  Let a
be in D.  Then an element b of D is a-complete iff b >= a, so b[a] = a v
b.
This might suggest that in general, B[A] should be functorial in A (as
well as in B), but it's not.  You can use example (1) to show this.

4. Take the discrete-space/point-set adjunction between D = Top and C =
Set.  Write 2 for the discrete 2-point space.  Then a space is 2-complete
iff it is a Stone space, i.e. compact Hausdorff totally disconnected.  So
if B is any space, B[2] is the reflection of B into Stone spaces.

It's striking that the adjunction between Top and Set, together with the
simple space 2, give rise to the notion of Stone space.  Poetically, "the
theory of the 2-point space is the theory of Stone spaces".

All of this remains true if 2 is replaced by any other Stone space with >
1 element.  (But it's most dramatic if you use 2.)

5. This is the most substantial example, and it's what started me off on
all this.  It's from work of Matthias Schroeder and Alex Simpson: see
Simpson's talk "Probabilistic Observations and Valuations" at

http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/als/Talks/

Let D be the category of topological spaces equipped with a binary
operation and C = Top, with the obvious adjunction between them.  Let I =
[0, 1] with topology generated by all the subintervals (x, 1], and the
midpoint (mean) operation.  Schroeder and Simpson prove, among other
things, that if X is a compact Hausdorff space then (FX)[I] is the space
of regular Borel probability measures on X, equipped with the weak
topology (and the obvious midpoint operation).  Using the universal
property of (FX)[I], this also gives the definition of integration on X.


I'd be interested to know what other people make of this.  Perhaps, for
instance, someone knows a good way to describe which properties can be
defined by "laws" in the sense above, and perhaps someone can shed some
light on the non-functoriality noted in (3).

Thanks for reading,
Tom

A simple answer to Tom Leinster's question involves the Galois connection
well-analyzed by Michel Hebert at Whitepoint (2006): in a fixed category
an object A can "satisfy" a morphism q: F->Q  iff  q*: (Q,A) -> (F,A) is a
bijection. Then for any class of objects A there is the class of "laws" q
satisfied by all of them, and reciprocally. If the category itself is
mildly exact, one could instead of morphisms q consider their kernels as
reflexive pairs. For example, if there is a free notion, a reflexive pair
F' =>F has a coequalizer which could be taken as a law q.

However, the "categorical story" that Tom was missing is not told well
by the "Universal Algebra" of 75 years ago. Unfortunately, Galois
connections in the sense of Ore are not "universal" enough to explicate
the related universal phenomena in algebra, algebraic geometry, and
functional analysis. The mere order-reversing maps between posets of
classes are usually restrictions of adjoint functors between categories,
and noting this explicitly gives further information. For example,
Birkhoff's theorem does not apply well to the question:

"Do groups form a variety of monoids?"

Indeed, does the word "variety" mean a kind of category or a kind of
inclusion functor? In algebraic geometry, an analogous question concerns
whether an algebraic space that is a subspace of another one is closed
(i.e. definable by equations) or not. Often instead it is defined by
inverting some global functions, giving an open subscheme, not a
subvariety, but still a good subspace. The analogy goes still further; a
typical open subspace of X is actually a closed subspace of X x R, and of
course the category of groups does become a variety if we adjoin an
additional operation to the theory of monoids.

In my thesis (1963)
(now available on-line as a TAC Reprint, and extensively
elaborated on by Linton and others in SLNM 80) I isolated an adjoint pair
"Structure/Semantics" strictly analogous to the basic "Function
algebra/Spectrum) pairs occurring in algebraic geometry and in functional
analysis. In that context, note that the epimorphisms in the category of
theories (categories with finite products) include both surjections (laws
given by equations, dual semantically to Birkhoff subvarieties) as well as
localizations (laws given by adjoining inverses to previously given
operations, semantically corresponding to "open" algebraic subcategories).
Can these "open" inclusions between algebraic categories be characterized
semantically?

The technical notion "Structure of" was motivated by the example of
cohomology operations: in general, the totality of natural operations on
the values of a given functor involves both more operations and more laws
than those of the codomain category. The example illustrates that such
adjoints are of much broader interest than the mere perfect duality that
one might obtain by restricting both sides (one does not expect to recover
a space from its cohomology, and the category of spaces studied is not
even an algebraic category).

As an important further example of a large adjoint which specializes both
to Galois connections in each space as well as to a perfect duality on
suitable subcategories, consider Stone's study of the relation between
spaces and real commutative algebras; for computational purposes,
the spaces of the form C(X) need to receive morphisms from algebras A
(like polynomial algebras) that are not of that form; such homomorphisms
are by adjointness equivalent to continuous maps X --> Spec(A), where
Spec(A) would map further to R^n if n were a chosen parameterizer for
generators of A in a presentation.

Best wishes to all.

One aspect of the categorisation of "equation"  is the approach of
Banaschewski and Herrlich.  This replaces an equation as a pair (s,t)
of terms that belong to some free algebra F by the least quotient
(coequaliser)

e: F -->> F/E

identifying s and t.

An algebra A satisfies equation (s,t) precisely when every
homomorphism   F --> A lifts across e to a homomorphism   F/E --> A.

Thus the notion of an equation becomes that of a regular epi e with
free domain, and an object satisfies such an e when it is injective
for e.

To obtain a notion intrinsic to a given category, the free domains
were replaced by domains that are regular-projective, i.e. projective
for all regular epis, this being a property enjoyed by free algebras
in categories of universal algebras.

The approach has been dualised in the coalgebra literature, with a
"coequation" being defined as a regular mono with regular-injective
codomain, and a "covariety" as the class of coalgebras that are
projective for some given class of coequations.

Some (not all) relevant references are below.

Rob

Isomorphic images of subalgebras of products and ultraproducts, I believe
- the standard notation for this seems to be $ISP_U$.

Further, there is the interesting result that TH(G) =3D Th(H) for any fre=
e
nonabelian groups G and H. The following paper gives a summary of this
result and a discussion of equations in free groups:

Once again, we're hiring.  There are two positions available, Lecturer and
Senior Lecturer/Reader.  See the forwarded mail below.

For those not familiar with British academic terminology, these are all
tenured jobs.  Lecturer is the basic position (e.g. that's what I am).
Senior Lecturer and Reader are more senior.  Professors are relative
rarities; it's perfectly normal to finish one's career as a SL or Reader,
without ever becoming a Professor.

I should point out that this huge wave of hiring has not been brought
about by mass desertion.  It's mainly for demographic reasons (lots of
people retiring), and in this case because of a couple of people moving
from teaching to pure research roles.

The blurb says that "preference may be given to" those with an interest in
analysis, geometry or topology.  However, (a) in the past we've tended to
be quite open-minded about appointing people outside our specifically
targetted areas, and (b) for certain reasons, I think that now could be
quite a favourable time for a category theorist to apply.

If you want any further informal information, feel free to get in touch.

Hello all, I'm a complete novice to Category Theory, and I'm looking for
some kind of tutorial or other introductory material that would help me
at least get up to speed with the basics.  Maybe something that assumed
some discrete math and abstract algebra, and proceeded to develop the
topic for beginners.  Are there any intro texts like that out there?
(And if not, would someone please write and publish one? :->)

    Thanks,

                MFPS 23 Preliminary Announcement

The 23rd Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming
Semantics (MFPS 23) will take place in New Orleans, LA USA from April
11 to April 14, 2007. The Conference will be held on the campus of
Tulane University, as has been the case with previous MFPS meetings
in New Orleans. This is a preliminary announcement to provide
important dates for submissions to the conference.

MFPS 23 will feature six invited addresses by programming semantics,
its mathematical and logical underpinnings, and in related areas.
There also will be a number of special sessions, and a Tutorial Day
on April 10 will precede the meeting. Among the special sessions will
be one honoring Gordon Plotkin on his many contributions to the area.
This session will be organized by Samson Abramsky (Oxford).

The MFPS 23 Program Committee will be chaired by Marcelo Fiore
(Cambridge). The important dates are:
   Friday, December 15 - Deadline for submission of titles and short
abstracts of intended submissions
   Friday, December 22 - Deadline for submission of full papers
   Friday, February 9 - Announcement of accepted papers
   Friday, March 2 - Deadline for submission of accepted papers in
final form
As was done this year, the Proceedings of the meeting will be
published in final form at the time of the meeting, in hard copy and
online in the ENTCS series. In addition, there will be a special
journal issue composed of selected papers from the meeting, compiled
after the meeting takes place.

A full Call for Papers will be forthcoming around September 15,
including the list of PC members, the names of the invited speakers,
the full list of special sessions and their organizers, and specifics
about the Tutorial Day activities. More information about the MFPS
series can be found at its web site http://www.math.tulane/edu/~mfps/

Bill Lawvere uses "linear" for a category enriched over commutative
semigroups.  Obviously, if the category has finite products, this is a
property.  What about in the absence of finite products (or sums)?  Could
you have two (semi)ring structures on the same set with the same
associative multiplication?

Robin Houston's startling (to me, anyway) proof that a compact
*-autonomous category with finite products is linear starts by proving
that 0 = 1.  Suppose the category has only binary products?  Well, I have
an example of one that is not linear:  Lawvere's category that is the
ordered set of real numbers has a compact *-autonomous structure.
Tensor is + and internal hom is -.  Product is inf and sum is sup, but
there are no initial or terminal objects and the category is not linear.

Dear All,

What Tom says now, and what Bill calls a simple answer referring to Miche=
l
Hebert, also suggests to mention

[H. Andr=E9ka and I. N=E9meti, Los lemma holds in every category, Stud. S=
ci.
Math. Hung. 13, 1978, 361-376]

(although a previous paper of the same authors would be needed, I think).
And I am sure many other people also considered many other candidates for
the concept of a "law" producing a suitable Galois connection. And - no
doubt - many such constructions would produce interesting Galois closed
classes.

However, I think "the Universal Algebra of 75 years ago" gave a beautiful
and fundamental example, were the Galois closed classes are fully and
beautifully described (that Galois connection deals with subvarieties of =
a
fixed variety, with fixed "basic operators" and so there is no problem wi=
th
"What is a variety?" of course).

This does not mean that I am trying to argue with Bill: Of course it is t=
rue
that Bill's thesis was a great further enlightenment, and of course it is
true that TODAY seeing only those Galois connections and not seeing
adjunctions containing them and much more (also in Galois theory itself!)=
 is
too bad!

Sorry Mike, I believe you misunderstood my definition of "Linear
category". It is in my paper

"Categories of Space and of Quantity"
International Symposium on Structures in Mathematical Theories, San
Sebastian (1990), published in the Book "The Space of Mathamtics.
Philosophical, Epistemological and Historical Explorations. DeGruyter,
Berlin (1992), 14-30.

Namely, because "additive" was already established standard usage that
included negatives, and because the importance in algebraic geometry etc.
of rigs other than rings and distributive lattices had been historically
underestimated, I chose the name "linear" because it would at least
have an intuitive resonance with physicists and computer scientists and
others who routinely apply linear algebra to positive and other contexts.
Thus, the definition is simply

a category with finite products and coproducts which agree (i.e. there is
a zero object which permits the definition of identity matrices, which are
required to be invertible).

Of course this implies enrichment in additive monoids.

However, the question of whether a multiplicative monoid has a unique
addition is of interest. I believe it was resolved in the negative by the
Tarski school of universal algebra, although I cannot recall the
reference, nor whether their examples were as straightforward as Steve
Lack's.

In ambient categories other than abstract sets, that question has been of
interest to me in particular in connection with the foundations of smooth
geometry and calculus. Euler's definition of real numbers as ratios of
infinitesimals leads immediately to a definition of multiplication as
composition of pointed endomorphisms of an infinitesimal object T. This
endomorphism monoid R of course has a zero element and hence there are two
canonical injections from it into R x R and the requirement on an addition
is that it be R-homogeneous and restrict to the identity along both those
injections. In classical algebraic geometry, where T is coordinatized as
the spectrum of the dual numbers, this addition is unique. In a
forthcoming paper I try to approach that result from a conceptual
standpoint, by invoking expected functorial properties of integration or
differentiation. The matter still needs to be clarified.

Concerning Mike's example of the real numbers as a *-autonomous category
under addition, I found it useful to note, in my 1983 Minnesota Report on
the existence of semi-continuous entropy functions, that the
system of extended real numbers, including both positive and negative
infinity, is also a closed monoidal category (even though not all objects
are reflexive). There are actually two such structures, depending on which
sense of the ordering one takes as the arrows of the category; the
definition of addition (which is to be the tensor product) must preserve
colimits in each variable (where colimits has the two possible
meanings). Besides its utility in freely performing certain operations in
analysis, this structure strikingly illustrates a point often made to
young students: subtraction is just addition of negatives, provided one is
in a group like the real numbers; however, in general the binary operation
of subtraction can be merely adjoint to addition and, in fact, the
condition that A is a "compact" object in a SMC

   for all B, A* @ B --> hom(A,B)is invertible

precisely characterizes the finite real numbers.

Best wishes,

Bill

Dear Steve,

It is true that constructing such examples with more than one object is even
easier in a sense. However your example needs a minor correction:

What is 1+1 in C(x,x) and in C(y,y)?

If it is 0, them M must be a Z/2Z-module, since for every element u in M we
have u+u = 1u+1u = (1+1)u = 0u = 0.

If it is 1, them M must be idempotent (as before: u+u = 1u+1u = (1+1)u = 1u
= u).

If it is 1 in C(x,x) and 0 in C(y,y), then M becomes trivial, which destroys
the example.

And... why did not you and I just take the monoid {0,1}, which becomes a
commutative semiring for both additions?!

More generally, take any non-degenerated Boolean algebra. It has
multiplication=intersection=meet, and at least two additions (symmetric
difference and union=join) both good for that multiplication.

George

It's a structure.

Consider the following category C.
Two objects x and y, with hom-categories
C(x,x)=C(y,y)={0,1}
C(y,x)={0}
C(x,y)=M
with composition defined so that each 1 is an
identity morphism and each 0 a zero morphism,
and with M an arbitrary set. Any commutative
monoid structure on M makes C into a linear category.

Consider the following category C.
Two objects x and y, with hom-categories
C(x,x)=3DC(y,y)=3D{0,1}
C(y,x)=3D{0}
C(x,y)=3DM
with composition defined so that each 1 is an=20
identity morphism and each 0 a zero morphism,
and with M an arbitrary set. Any commutative=20
monoid structure on M makes C into a linear category.=20

Dear Michael,

I have a trivial comment to the first paragraph of your message. You ask:

"...Could you have two (semi)ring structures on the same set with the same
associative multiplication?"

Take any (semi)ring R with a multiplicative automorphism f that is not an
additive automorphism, and transport the structure along f. For instance,
both in the semiring of natural numbers and in the ring of integers, any
non-identity permutation of (positive) prime numbers determines such an f.

An example for students: take, say,

f(2) = 3, f(3) = 2, and f(p) = p for all primes p different from 2 and 3.

Then, denoting the new addition by *, we calculate (usung the fact that f
coincides with its inverse)

1*1 = f(f(1)+f(1)) = f(2+2) = f(2x2) = f(2)xf(2) = 3x3 = 9.

Best regards,

George

Thanks to Bill Lawvere for pointing out the close connection between the
questions I was asking and the recent work of Jiri Adamek, Michel Hebert
and Lurdes Sousa, presented at both CT06 and the Glasgow PSSL.  It must
have lodged itself in my mind in some subliminal way; apologies for not
mentioning it earlier.

Perhaps the following is rather basic, but I'm failing to understand one
of the points in Bill's message.  As I read it, he's saying that the
Galois connection of traditional universal algebra (connecting sets of
laws and varieties of algebras) is contained within the
structure-semantics adjunction of his thesis.  I don't see how this works.

I *do* understand the following points:

1. Traditional universal algebra - given a signature S, one has the set E
of equations between S-terms and the class V of S-algebras, and the
relation "satisfaction" gives a Galois connection between the
power-sets/classes P(E) and P(V).  A Galois connection is, of course, a
contravariant adjunction on the right between posets.

2. Categorical algebra - structure and semantics form a contravariant
adjunction on the right between the category Th of Lawvere theories and
(roughly speaking) the category K of categories over Set.  One is a
section of the other: if T is a theory then Struc(Sem(T)) = T.

3. If T is a theory, any equation between the operations in T can be
construed as a pair of parallel arrows in T, and so induces a map from T
to the quotient theory T' obtained by imposing this equation.  Such a map
T ---> T' is an epimorphism, although not every epi in the category of
theories arises in this way.

4. Given a contravariant adjunction on the right, both functors turn
colimits into limits, hence epis into monos.  In particular, any set of
equations between the operations of a theory T induces an epi T ---> T',
hence a mono Sem(T') ---> Sem(T) between the categories of models, which
may perhaps be the inclusion of a full subcategory.

This makes it look as if there's going to be a Galois connection between
the poset of quotient objects of T (i.e. epis out of T) and subobjects of
Sem(T), for every theory T.  But there seem to be two problems:

(i) the functors in an adjunction on the right don't in general turn monos
into epis, so I don't see why the structure-semantics adjunction is going
to turn subcategories of Sem(T) into quotient theories of T;

(ii) even if this did work, epis out of T are more general than equations,
and monos into Sem(T) are more general than full subcategories, so it
wouldn't exactly recover the classical Galois connection of universal
algebra.

I guess I've made a wrong turn somewhere; can someone put me right?

Thanks,
Tom

functional analysis. The mere order-reversing maps between posets of
classes are usually restrictions of adjoint functors between categories,
and noting this explicitly gives further information. For example,
Birkhoff's theorem does not apply well to the question:

inverting some global functions, giving an open subscheme, not a
subvariety, but still a good subspace. The analogy goes still further; a

You are right, and thank you the correction (I think I thought of 3*3 =
f(f(3)+f(3)) = f(2+2) =..., but does not matter of course).

Dear Bill,

Having two structures in {0,1} (with 1+1 = 0 and with 1+1 = 1) makes what

The thoughts being developed by Tom Leinster give renewed hope that
results of 40 years ago are being further developed, beyond mere icons,
into tools for actual analysis of algebraic problems *.

I should perhaps have mentioned Lourdes Sousa's very interesting talk at
White Point. She and Michel Hebert had divided the presentation of the
work into existential (or injective) logic, and uniquely existential
logic, and the latter is more directly relevant to the present discussion.

The fact that a contravariant adjoint pair gives rise to Galois
connections at each object is important in many different situations, for
example in the classical study of rings of continuous functions on
topological spaces. The information inherent in this remark is less
visible if one arbitrarily restricts consideration to general epis and
general monos (it was here that Tom made a "wrong turn" in his items
4.(i) and 4.(ii) ). To recover the classical Galois connection of
universal algebra one must apply adjointness, and then take surjective (or
regular epimorphic) images. The above general remark depends on the
availability of operations like image in the categories that are being
confronted in the adjointness.

Again, I emphasize that in the classical case of continuous functions, it
is important to consider algebras A which are not of the form C(Y). A
possibly useful remark is that, under suitable restrictions on the
category of spaces, the Stone-Weierstrass theorem can be interpreted as
the statement that A --> C(X) is an epimorphism of rings iff its mate
X --> Spec(A) is a monomorphism. But then by restricting the kind of
epimorphisms and monomorphisms considered one obtains Galois connections
which were originally considered by Stone in the 1930s before the more
general functorial formulation which many of us learned from
J.L. Kelley's General Topology.

If one considers a tractable functor X --> Sem(T) from a very general
category X into a very special kind of category of the classical universal
algebra type, (i.e. where T is from the special doctrine of categories
with finite products, etc.) then the structure functor Str assigns to the
composite functor X --> Sets a definite algebraic theory Str(X) with a
morphism of theories T -->Str(X). The surjective image of the latter
morphism, of course, is the embodiment of the classical construction in
the special case where the original tractable functor was a full
inclusion. However, there are many full inclusions for which one has
X = Sem(Str(X)), i.e. X is an algebraic category even though it is not a
variety in Sem(T).

Remark: The difference between an object (in this case an algebraic
category) and an inclusion map (in this discussion a full inclusion
functor) is of course not eliminated by restricting to the case where T is
a free theory. It seems reasonable to use the classical term "variety" to
refer to those inclusion functors fixed under Birkhoff's Galois
correspondence, i.e. to those for which not only is X equal to the
semantics of its structure, but for which moreover the morphism of
theories T --> Str(X) is already surjective (which of course it is not in
the example mentioned of groups in monoids).

There are several local studies possible within the context of a given
global adjoint. It seems to be an open problem to describe those full
inclusions X --> Sem(T) for which T --> Str(X) is a localization (in which
case the inclusion, if fixed, might be called "open" in contrast to the
Birkhoff subvarieties which are clearly analogous to "closed" subspaces).
A further problem: "locally closed" is a kind of inclusion of interest in
geometry, so why should it not be also here?

* see also the paper "Some Algebraic Problems..." following the Thesis in
the TAC Reprints.

Beyond simple counter examples to general statements, the Tarski school
also pursued conditions on particular monoids which might imply uniqueness
of a ring structure, or a definite range of ring structures.

As I suggested, that open problem takes on a deeper significance if we
consider it within categories of cohesion, not just within the category of
abstract sets.

Best wishes to all.

Hi Stephen

There are numerous books on Category Theory, but only one I can think of
fits your criteria. You may want to look at:
  Conceptual Mathematics
  by F.W. Lawvere and S. H. Schanuel
  ISBN 0-521-47817-0 (paperback)

It gives a good thorough intro to the subject.

Online and free is "A Gentle Introduction to Category Theory" by Maarten
Fokkinga at http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~fokkinga/mmf92b.html

Depending on your math background, you may find the second a little fast
paced.

Good luck

3WFTop First Announcement:

THIRD WORKSHOP ON FORMAL TOPOLOGY

Accademia Galileiana, Padua (Italy)

9-12 May 2007 workshop
7-8 May 2007 tutorials

This is the third of a series of successful meetings on the
development of Formal Topology and its connections with
related approaches. The first two have been held in Padua,
1997, and Venice, 2002.

For more information on 3WFTop see
http://www.3wftop.math.unipd.it/

What is formal topology
When topology is developed in a strictly constructive way,
for instance over Martin-Loef's type theory, points cannot be
given primitively and the pointfree approach is fundamental.
This is the reason why it is called formal. Formal topology
has now become an important tool in constructive mathematics.
More on formal topology:
http://www.3wftop.math.unipd.it/formal-topology.html

Invited speakers
Invited speakers include Andre' Joyal, Per Martin-Loef and
many other prominent scholars:
http://www.3wftop.math.unipd.it/invited-speakers.html

Tutorials
Before the workshop, two days of extensive and coordinated
tutorials are planned, given by Bernhard Banaschewski and
other pioneers: http://www.3wftop.math.unipd.it/tutorials.html

Contacts
If you wish to be kept updated with information about 3WFTop,
please send an e-mail to:  fortop@math.lmu.de  with

Some of you may enjoy this:

Lectures on n-Categories and Cohomology
John Baez and Michael Shulman
http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608420

The goal of these talks was to explain how cohomology and other
tools of algebraic topology are seen through the lens of n-category
theory.  Special topics include nonabelian cohomology, Postnikov
towers, the theory of "n-stuff", and n-categories for n = -1 and -2.
The talks were very informal, and so are these notes.  A lengthy
appendix clarifies certain puzzles and ventures into deeper waters
such as higher topos theory.  For readers who want more details,
we include an annotated bibliography.

Dear category theorists,

I have been plagued by the following question: does the classifying
space functor commute with (co)limits?

In particular, I have a system of compact topological groups G_i
indexed by the natural numbers, and a whole lot of inclusions.

Is B colim G_i homotopic to colim BG_i ?

I have a hint that this should be so in my particular situation (in a
letter of Serre to Grothendieck), but I'd like to know how the
general case goes.

Cheers,

Dear Categorists -

David Corfield, Urs Schreiber and I have started a group
blog on math, physics and philosophy called The n-Category Cafe:

http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/

You're all invited to come over, order an espresso and chat.
We'll talk about lots of things besides n-category theory,
but that's one of our shared interests, so we'll probably
talk a lot about that.

One interesting feature of this blog is that it lets you use TeX.

Best,
jb

Back from holidays I am slowly working through the various interesting
e-mails of Tom Leinster. The examples he presents in his e-mail on August
9 seem to lead to the following question: given on object A characterize
the full subcategory L_A  of all objects satisfying all "laws" that A
satisfies. The algebraic case ("law" meaning equation) has two obvious
generalizations: orthogonality and injectivity. For both of them the
answer to the above question is nice and easy.

INJECTIVITY: let H be the class of morphisms generated by {A} in the
Galois connection "to be injective to". (That is, H consists of all
morphisms to which A is injective.) The opposite class
	L_A = Inj H
of all objects injective w.r.t. H consists of precisely all split
subobjects of powers of A.
This holds in every category with powers.

Proof: injectivity classes are clearly closed under product and split
subobject. Conversely, if B lies in Inj H, then it is a split subobject
of the power of A to hom(B,A). In fact, the canonical morphism
m from B to the power of A to hom(B,A) lies in H: given a morphism
f: B -> A, then f factorizes through m via the projection
of A^hom(B,A) corresponding to f. Consequently, B is injective w.r.t. m,
and since B is the domain of m, this implies trivially that m is a split
mono.

ORTHOGONALITY: let K be the class of morphisms generated by {A} in the
Galois connection "to be orthogonal to". The opposite class
	L_A = Ort K
of all objects orthogonal to K is the closure of {A} under limits.
This holds in every complete and cowellpowered category.

Proof: orthogonality classes are clearly closed under limit, thus,
Ort K contains the limit closure L of {A}. To prove the opposite inclusion
observe that L is a reflective subcategory due to Freyd's SAFT: A is
easily seen to be a cogenerator of L. For every object B in Ort K
a reflection r: B -> B' in L lies in K (since A lies in L). Thus,
B is orthogonal to r. This implies that r is a split mono. Now L
contains B' and is closed under split subobjects, thus B lies in L.

FINITARY LAWS
The algebraic case has another feature: every equation, when translated
as injectivity or orthogonality w.r.t. a morphism e:A-> B, has the
property that both A and B are finitely presentable. We can thus decide
to restrict our attention to finitary morphisms, i.e., morhisms with
finitely presentable domains and codomains, as our "laws".

If H is the class of all finitary morphisms to which A is injective,
then the injectivity class Inj H is the closure of {A} under product,
filtered colimit and pure subobject. This was proved by J. Rosicky,
F. Borceux and myself in TAC 10 (2002), 148-161.

If K is the class of all finitary morphisms to which A is orthogonal,
then the orthogonality class Ort K is the closure of {A} under product,
filtered colimit and A-pure subobject as proved by L. Sousa and myself in
JPAA 276 (2004), 685-705. (The concept of A-pure subobject is a bit
artificial, but unfortunately the above result is false if one substitutes
it with pure morphism. Surprisingly, when generalizing finitary morphisms
to k-ary morphisms for uncountable cardinals k, the corresponding result
does hold with pure subobjects: see M. Hebert and J. Rosicky, Bull. London
Math. Soc 33 (2001) 685-688.)

Here is what the site actually says:

Monotone functions respect order, group homomorphisms respect the group
operation, linear transformations respect linear combinations, and
gangsters respect membership in the Cosa Nostra, but what morphism has
ever respected membership in a set? It is sheer hubris for a relation that
can't get no respect to claim to support all of mathematics.
(Old argument of category theorist Mike Barr, new polemics.)

That is not a bad rendition (save for the reference to Cosa Nostra) of
what I actually said which was that we create these elaborate structures
of well-founded trees subject to the rule that two chidren of the same
leaf cannot be isomorphic.  But then, unlike all other structures that we
build, we make no hypothesis that functions preserve the structure.
Indeed, I think a structure-preserving map must be the inclusion of a
subset.  And there are no non-identity endomorphisms.

Dear David,

> I have been plagued by the following question: does the classifying
> space functor commute with (co)limits?

The classifying space functor (from Cat to Top) does preserve finite
products.  It doesn't preserve all infinite products, e.g. let A be the
discrete category with two objects and consider the product of
infinitely many copies of A.  Nor does it preserve all colimits, as the
following example shows.

Let 1 be the terminal category, 2 the category consisting of a single
arrow, and 3 the category consisting of a commutative triangle:

1 = .
2 = . --> .
3 = . --> . --> .

Take the two different functors from 1 to 2.  The pushout of the diagram
in Cat formed by these functors is 3, and B3 is Delta^2, the standard
topological 2-simplex.  However, B1 is the one-point space and B2 is the
unit interval, so the pushout of B1 and B2 is an interval of length 2,
which is not homeomorphic to Delta^2.

This doesn't answer your question about sequential colimits, but maybe
it gives some helpful context.

Best wishes,
Tom

Ronnie Brown

Extract from a letter Alexander Grothendieck to Ronnie Brown, 06/ 09/1983

It is all too evident I am not an expert
on homotopy theory, and the books I am bold enough to write now on
foundational matters are very likely to be looked at as ``rubbish"
too by most experts, unless I show up with $\pi_{147}(S^{123}$  as a
by-product (whereas it is for the least doubtful I will...). At the
very least, you should give me some hints as to the kind of things I
could reasonably say in a ``formal note of support", besides how
nice it would be to have a better understanding of the foundational
matters. This makes me think by the way that (much to my surprise, I
confess) I never got a line from Quillen in reply to my long letter
from February. I guess since that time he should have gotten that
letter, maybe you even gave him a copy time ago if I remember it
right. As two letters for me in the Faculty mail got lost lately, it
isn't wholly impossible that he did reply and I didn't get it. In
case you should know something on this behalf, please tell me.

I realize somewhat belatedly that I should apologize for the
mistaken impression I got, from a quick glance through the heap of
reprints you sent me a year or so ago, and which I somewhat bluntly
expressed in my first letter to you I believe - namely that you had
little or no background in so-called ``geometry". It would be more
accurate, it seems, to say that your background and mine don't
overlap too much. My own background has been somewhat moving for the
last ten or twelve years, since I withdrew rather abruptly from the
mathematical milieu. Thus my interest in the Teichm\"{u}ller (or
mapping class) group has developed mainly, in two steps, during the
last two years and a half. It came quite as a surprise that you have
come to some contact with these groups, too - and I would be quite
interested to get a reference on this ``amazing finite presentation"
you are speaking of (and I can well imagine it must be tied up with
the Mumford-Deligne compactification of the relevant modular
multiplicity, whose $\pi_1$  is the group we are looking at). I was
under the impression that to give an explicit presentation of the
group, rather than of the groupoid, would be kind of inextricable,
and it is surely an interesting fact it is not. Still, I am pretty
sure for the ``arithmetical'' theory I am interested in, that one
just cannot possibly dispense from working with groupoids, rather
than just groups. A few times in your letter you stop to ask what of
all you're saying would make sense with spaces replaced by topoi,
and wondering if it would be a long way to do those things in the
wider context. If you are just interested in homotopy types (more
accurately, prohomotopy types) of topoi, it seems to me that
Artin-Mazur have developed more or less all the machinery needed, in
order for any result in semisimplicial homotopy theory, say, to
carry over more or less automatically to topoi. This isn't really
the most interesting thing they did, but rather what could be
considered as the routine part of their work, which they develop by
standard semisimplicial homotopy techniques. What they were really
after was giving various ``profinite" variants of homotopy types and
a formalism of ``profinite completion" of usual (pro )homotopy
types, relevant when working with \'etale cohomology of schemes, and
using this, stating and proving a few key theorems, a typical one
being that for a proper and smooth morphism of schemes $[f]$ and
taking profinite completions (of homotopy types) ``prime to the
residue characteristics", the theoretical ``homotopy fiber" of the
map $[f]$ can be identified with the (prohomotopy type of the)
actual schematic geometric fibers of the map $[f]$. It turns out
that the algebraic machinery reduces these statements to
corresponding statements about cohomology with torsion coefficients
(including non-commutative cohomology in dimension 1), which had all
been proved in the SGA4 seminar by Artin and me.

I think within the next day I am going to read through your preprint
``An introduction to simplicial T-complexes", as you suggested,
maybe I'll write again if I have any questions. For the time being,
I guess I'll stop. And thank you again very much for your patient
help.

Very affectionately

Alexander

On colimits of classifying spaces.  This topologist
may be missing something, but the conclusion seems
obviously true, at least in reasonable situations.
With a countable system of inclusions of spaces,
unless the situation is fairly bizarre, the system
will be filtered and we can find a countable cofinal
sequence.  But finite products commute with sequential
colimits in reasonable categories of spaces.  Since
the usual classifying space of G is constructed as
the geometric realization of a simplicial space whose
space of q-simplices is G^q, and since geometric
realization certainly commutes with sequential colimits,
the conclusion seems clear.  It is used all the time
in algebraic topology, in such familiar examples as
BU = colim BU(n), BTop = colim BTop(n), BF = colim BF(n),
etc, the last being a system of monoids rather than groups.
In the standard classical statement that BU classifies
stable complex vector bundles, we are using the first
listed special case.  While the groups are compact in
that case, compactness is not relevant to the argument
and fails for the groups Top(n), for example.  In more
complicated equivariant situations, one has countable
systems that are not naturally sequential, but again the
conclusion is familiar and in common use.

Peter

Dear David,

The classifying space functor is the composite of the nerve
functor N:Cat-->SSet and the geometric realization functor
SSet-->Top, and it makes sense to consider them separately.

The nerve functor preserves all limits (since it is a right
adjoint) but not all colimits. It does preserve=20
sequential colimits, since it is given by homming out of
the finite ordinals, which are finitely presentable.=20

More explicitly, the nerve NC of a category C is the simplicial
set whose set (NC)_n of n-simplices is the set of all functors
from [n] to C, where [n] is the category {0<1<...<n}. Now each
of these [n] is finitely presentable, meaning that homming out
of it preserves filtered colimits, so N itself preserves filtered
colimits.

Similarly, N does preserve coproducts, since the [n] are all connected.
(To preserve coproducts and filtered colimits is to preserve what=20
Mac Lane calls pseudofiltered colimits.)

The geometric realization functor is a left adjoint (it is the left
Kan extension along Yoneda of the standard map Delta-->Top) and=20
so preserves all colimits, but relatively few limits. It does,
as Tom Leinster observes, preserve finite products.

Putting these facts together, one sees that the classifying=20
space functor preserves coproducts, filtered colimits, and finite =
products.

Steve Lack.

Dear David,

> I have been plagued by the following question: does the classifying
> space functor commute with (co)limits?

The classifying space functor (from Cat to Top) does preserve finite
products.  It doesn't preserve all infinite products, e.g. let A be the
discrete category with two objects and consider the product of
infinitely many copies of A.  Nor does it preserve all colimits, as the
following example shows.

Let 1 be the terminal category, 2 the category consisting of a single
arrow, and 3 the category consisting of a commutative triangle:

1 =3D .
2 =3D . --> .
3 =3D . --> . --> .

Take the two different functors from 1 to 2.  The pushout of the diagram
in Cat formed by these functors is 3, and B3 is Delta^2, the standard
topological 2-simplex.  However, B1 is the one-point space and B2 is the
unit interval, so the pushout of B1 and B2 is an interval of length 2,
which is not homeomorphic to Delta^2.

This doesn't answer your question about sequential colimits, but maybe
it gives some helpful context.

Best wishes,
Tom

Yes; we didn't get into TQFTs at all in our notes, but Martins
and Porter use the classifying space of a discrete 2-group
(=3D categorical group =3D crossed module =3D gr-category) in their
construction, and that's quite relevant.

I wrote a little introduction to the Martins-Porter paper and its
antecedents at the n-category cafe:
