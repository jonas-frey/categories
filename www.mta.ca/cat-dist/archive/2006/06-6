			CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

     4th International Workshop on Quantum Programming Languages
			      (QPL 2006)

		       July 17-19, 2006, Oxford
     (held in conjunction with CKC, "Cats, Kets, and Cloisters")

	    http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/qpl2006/

				* * *
NEW:

 * list of accepted papers
 * available support for UK-based PhD students (deadline June 20)

OVERVIEW:

  The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working
  on mathematical foundations and programming languages for quantum
  computing. In the last few years, there has been a growing interest
  in logical tools, languages, and semantical methods for analyzing
  quantum computation. These foundational approaches complement the
  more mainstream research in quantum computation which emphasizes
  algorithms and complexity theory.

  Topics of interest include the design and semantics of quantum
  programming languages, new paradigms for quantum programming,
  specification of quantum algorithms, higher-order quantum
  computation, quantum data types, reversible computation, axiomatic
  approaches to quantum computation, abstract models for quantum
  computation, properties of quantum computing resources and
  primitives, concurrent and distributed quantum computation,
  compilation of quantum programs, semantical methods in quantum
  information theory, and categorical models for quantum computation.

  Previous workshops in this series were held in Ottawa (2003), Turku
  (2004), and Chicago (2005).

  This year's workshop will be held in Oxford, as part of the
  week-long event "Cats, Kets and Cloisters", July 17-23, 2006,
  which will include four workshops on related topics (See

At University Paul Sabatier (Toulouse-3) a ph.d. studentship
is available. There is no restrictions concerning
nationality, but there is an age limit ( no more than
25 ans in 2006.) Please, notice very short delay:

- applications before 20.06

- interview 23.06

contact: soloviev@irit.fr

Theme:
The categories with structure including distinguished functors
and natural transformations (subject to certain identities)
are considered, such as the Symmetric Monoidal Closed Categories
with tensor $\otimes$ and hom-functor as distinguished functors,
associativity and commutativity of $\otimes$ etc. The "critical mass"
of theoretical results concerning the commutativity of diagrams
in such categories demands the development of adequate computer support
and software. The software should contain certain automated
and interactive verification procedures, in particular automated
procedures using the algorithms that are already known
and interactive procedures for extraction of consequences
of particular properties of concrete categories (e.g., categories
of modules). The theme is closely connected with proof theory
and commutative algebra. The competences in programming are required.
It is possible also that the ph.d. student will obtain new mathematical
results in addition to programming part.

=======================================================

        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

      FORMAL DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS:
           IFIP WG 2.2 Anniversary Meeting
                11-13 September 2006
                   Udine, Italy

           http://www.dimi.uniud.it/ifip06/


The IFIP Working Group 2.2 was established in 1965 as one of the first
IFIP Working Groups. The primary aim of the WG is to explain
programming concepts through the development, examination and
comparison of various formal models of these concepts. The WG thus
explores the theory and the practice of formal methods for the
specification, verification and the design of software and systems.

Earliest members of the WG included Dana Scott, Erwin Engeler, Jaco de
Bakker, Raymond Abrial, Peter Lauer, Manfred Paul, Erich Neuhold,
Maurice Nivat, Ed Blum. Throughout the years, members of the WG shaped
various styles of semantics, comprising denotational, operational,
algebraic, and logical semantics.

The anniversary meeting commemorates the 40-th birthday of WG. In the
meeting, a number of keynote speakers and current members of the WG
will give tutorial presentations on topics relevant to the WG,
focusing on history (of these topics, or of the WG), but also on
current outlook and future developments.

Keynote speakers: Amir Pnueli, Igor Walukiewicz, and Ernst-Rudiger
Olderog (as current WG members), Dana Scott, Manfred Paul, and Hans
Langmaack (as founding WG members), Leslie Lamport and Gordon Plotkin
(as
past WG members) .


Registration

  He [Guerino Mazzola] completed his PhD in mathematics and gained academic
  recognition in algebraic geometry and representation theory in 1980

  The next step was for Mazzola to apply his abstruse mathematical concepts,
  such as topos theory, to music theory

  [I have appended the Colin McLarty's MathSciNet review of Maxzola's "Topos of
  Music". Mazzola is still active as a reviewer for Math Reviews.]

HEADLINE: GUERINO MAZZOLA A WALKING MUSICAL CONTRADICTION

BODY:

from THE JAKARTA POST -- SATURDAY, MAY 27, 2006 -- PAGE 24 Acid rockers the
Grateful Dead have done it at the Great Sphinx of Giza; New Age instrumentalist
Yanni has done at the Acropolis; jazz pianist David Benoit has accomplished it
at India's Taj Mahal and China's Forbidden City

Two years ago, Swiss jazz pianist Guerino Mazzola also did it at the Prambanan
Hindu temple in Kalasan, Yogyakarta, when he made his first shot at performing
under the shadows of world's greatest monument

Next August, Mazzola will finally fulfill his dream of staging a show at one of
the Seven Wonders of the World and will have a chance to outshine the musical
greats

The 59-year-old musician is expected to stage a show under the shadow of
Borobudur temple in Magelang, Central Java, the world's largest Buddhist temple

Performing at one of the world renowned heritage sites would be a glorious feat
for lesser musicians, but Mazzola had the experience before when he staged a gig
at an Aztec ruin in Mexico

The planned Borobudur show -- slated for mid-August and to be the subject of a
documentary film by award-winning Indonesian filmmaker Garin Nugroho -- will,
however, be much more different

"It (the Aztec site show) was nothing, it was a flop as I absorbed no energy
from the historical site

"The planned Borobudur show, however, will be different as we have studied the
temple and the philosophy behind it and I hope I can absorb the energy from
ancient times," Mazzola said recently over a dinner in Kotagede, Yogyakarta

But even without Borobudur as a backdrop, Mazzola will likely deliver an
electrifying show and in turn draw a large crowd, among them knowledgeable jazz
fans

Known as the "Jackson Pollock of jazz", Mazzola has peddled for years the
so-called free jazz, a left-of-the-dial genre that champions musical exploration
to the fullest and sets aside any pretention to producing market-friendly music

A direct descendant of free-thinking jazz musicians like Ornette Coleman and
John Coltrane, Mazzola has adopted a technique that gives primacy to speed,
accuracy and dynamism, without abandoning sensitivity

Together with drummer Heinz Geisser, Mazzola have given a new meaning to jazz
improvisation, with each of their compositions being played in a different style
at each show

The duo has recorded several free-jazz CDs that have become a must- have for
jazz lovers in Europe. Mazzola has recorded music with jazz luminaries such as
Matt Maneri, Scott Fields and Rob Brown

"Unlike classical musicians who follow the direction from a conductor, a jazz
musician is a master of his own time and does not obey anybody," Mazzola said of
his esthetic

Casual fans, however, will be bewildered once they discover that Mazzola is also
a professionally trained mathematician who graduated from the University of
Zurich in mathematics, theoretical physics and crystallography

Someone who worships free musical expression -- unbound by technical constraints
-- he approaches his music with the precision of mathematical and physical
theories

He completed his PhD in mathematics and gained academic recognition in algebraic
geometry and representation theory in 1980

The next step was for Mazzola to apply his abstruse mathematical concepts, such
as topos theory, to music theory

"Music is a language that is very near to mathematics and there is a kind of
convergence between the two," Mazzola said, before launching into a lengthy
lecture about a new discovery in physical science that the elementary particles
that moved in space floated around and vibrated like strings on a violin

In spite of his verbose speech on mathematics that lent weight to his authority
in physical science, Mazzola dressed so casually that he could pass for, well, a
jazz musician

It took him 15 years of training in classical music before he found out about
jazz and became fascinated by it

And jazz proved to be much harder and more painful road to take

"I heard Errol Garner and was completely fascinated. I started listening to jazz
and learned his technique for 10 years. When practicing, my finger bled and the
keys were red everywhere," he said, referring to the American jazz pianist and
composer that played the greatest influence on his playing technique

He later found that the classical approach to piano was completely useless

After growing tired of imitating his idol, Mazzola started to use his sense to
guide him open up new musical terrain. "After spending many years imitating
others, you finally want to know what is inside you," he said

The decision to embrace free jazz could have also sprung from his contempt of
any authoritarian structure

A former communist well-versed in Karl Marx's works, Mazzola abandoned Marxism
and Communism after learning about its authoritarian tendencies

When he was a postgraduate university student in Paris, Mazzola was also drawn
to the Black Panther organization and protested against racism and the Vietnam
war

"Later, I learned about the abuse of authoritarian regimes that claimed to
espouse Marxism, and decided to leave it behind," he said

He also abandoned Christianity from learning that the church also showed a
similar authoritarian tendency, as in the Grand Inquisition

"I don't believe in God in a narrow sense. The only thing that I could agree
about God is that He has constructed the world through music," he said, with a
mixed expression between glee and solemnity

     **********************************************************************
Mazzola, Guerino(CH-ZRCH-MMI)
The topos of music. (English. English summary)

Geometric logic of concepts, theory, and performance. In collaboration with
Stefan Gvller and Stefan M|ller. With 1 CD-ROM (Windows, Macintosh and UNIX).
Birkhduser Verlag, Basel, 2002. xxx+1335 pp. ISBN 3-7643-5731-2 00A69 (18B25)

The author transposes the Pythagorean theory of harmonies into commutative
algebra because, on one hand, linearity is the modern version of additivity and
proportion, and on the other hand there are standard means for programming with
modules as data types. This working Pythagoreanism includes a CD with software
for analyzing scores and preparing them for electronic performance, and
recordings of some examples. Indeed the CD includes a pdf of the entire book,
nicer than the printed copy as it has color graphics plus active links to the
bibliography and to cross-references in the text.

There is an extensive mathematical analysis of musical structures
operationalized as categorical semantics for the programs. And the book gives a
very great deal of more cognitive scientific, semiotic, and literary music
theory. The author is known as a composer and a jazz pianist, and has other
publications in scheme theory, such as .ref[J. Algebra 78 (1982), no. 2,
292--302; MR0680361 (84d:16039)].

A key use of commutative algebra is given as "alterations are tangents". For
example, F-sharp and G-flat name the same tone and the same key on a piano
keyboard. The two names denote two different structural roles in
composition -- it matters that F-sharp is not just a note, but an alteration of
F-natural. The author regards the space of tones as an abelian group  M
so any single note is an element of the group, which the author treats as a
Z-element, a homomorphism  Z --> M  from the group of integers. Then an altered
note can be considered as a pair of notes, a base plus an altered value, and so
as a  Z x Z element of  M. In the traditional alterations, to sharps or flats,
the altered value is near the base note, and the author models these by
infinitesimal deformations, or tangent vectors. That is, he uses the ring of
dual numbers  Z[h], and all of this is applied over other ground rings than
Z, and thus brings us to scheme theory.

Symmetries within scores, and structural relations between scores, drive the
mathematics up to sheaves, and very briefly to toposes and Grothendieck
topologies. The author candidly states he is unsure whether this musicological
perspective can use topos cohomology (p. 436).

The remaining 800 pages of the book are more concrete (until the 100-page
appendix surveying concepts from group theory through schemes to vector fields
and differential equations). They deal with major semioticians, philosophers,
music critics and music theorists, especially computational music theorists.
They apply algebraic and geometric notions of symmetry, along with the
physiology of perception, to analyze harmony, cadence, motifs, tempo and
counterpoint. Examples analyzed at length focus on work of Bach and Beethoven,
but include Mozart and Debussy, Glenn Gould's eccentric performances, and the
author's works on the CD. All is operationalized as computational musicology, in
the software.

CALCO brings together researchers and practitioners to exchange new
results related to foundational aspects and both traditional and
emerging uses of algebras and coalgebras in computer science.

This is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces
and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods
in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development
Techniques). The first CALCO conference took place 2005 in Swansea,
Wales (http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/calco/index.php), and was a huge success.

The second event will take place 2007 in Bergen, Norway. Its aim is to
be at least as successful.

CALCO 2007 will be preceded by two events:

  * CALCO-jnr - a CALCO Young Researchers Workshop dedicated to
    presentations by PhD students and by those who completed
    their doctoral studies within the past few years.

  * Tools & Application Day - providing the opportunity to give
    system demonstrations.

There will be separate submission procedures for CALCO-jnr and the Tools &
Application Day, respectively.


Topics of Interest
------------------
We invite submissions of technical papers that report results of
theoretical work on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the
way these results can support methods and techniques for software
development, as well as experience with the transfer of resulting
technologies into industrial practise. We encourage submissions in
topics included or related to those in the lists below.

  * Abstract models and logics
    - Automata and languages,
    - Categorical semantics,
    - Modal logics,
    - Relational systems,
    - Graph transformation,
    - Term rewriting,
    - Adhesive categories

  * Specialised models and calculi
    - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems,
    - Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed,
      mobile, and context-aware computing,
    - General systems theory and computational models
      (chemical, biological, etc)

  * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
    - Abstract data types,
    - Inductive and coinductive methods,
    - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation),
    - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques,
    - Semantics of programming languages

  * System specification and verification
    - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification,
    - Formal testing and quality assurance,
    - Validation and verification,
    - Generative programming and model-driven development,
    - Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
      hardware/middleware/architectures,
    - Process algebra


Submission Guidelines
---------------------
Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Experience papers are
welcome, but they must clearly present general lessons learnt that
would be of interest and benefit to a broad audience of both
researchers and practitioners. As in 2005, it is planned to publish
the proceedings in the Springer LNCS series. Final papers will be no
more than 15 pages long in the format specified by Springer. It is
recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length (see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). Submissions that are
clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Proofs omitted due to
space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  Paper
submissions will be made electronically at the conference web
site. Both an abstract and the full paper must be submitted by their
respective submission deadlines. A special issue of the new high-
quality open access journal Logical Methods in Computer Science
(http://www.lmcs-online.org), consisting of extended versions of
selected papers will be produced after the conference if there are
enough good papers that can be extended and revised to the standards of
this journal.

Location and Organisation
-------------------------
Bergen was Norway's first capital from the 13th century, and up until
the 1830's Norway's biggest town. Its placement has made it a natural
point through which foreign influences penetrated to Norway and
Scandinavia and the Norwegian export was leaving the country (centuries
of membership in the Hanseatic League with export of fish
and timber). Many of the wooden houses and larger facilities from the
Hanseatic times survived fires and modernisation and make up today a
charming town center.  Nowadays Bergen is small by international
standards, but it has always been a meeting place for people and a
centre for commerce and culture. Spectacular fjords and mountains
surrounding the town, combined with a lively and sociable atmosphere,
make it a worthwhile place to visit.

The conference will be held at Grand Hotel Terminus in the centre of
Bergen. The hotel will handle room bookings individually.  A social
programme will complement the scientific event.

Sponsored by Department of informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen
University College, and IFIP WG1.3 on Foundations of System
Specification. Further sponsorships pending.

POSITION PRE-ANNOUNCEMENT

A  position of Maitre de Conferences (permanent position)  in
mathematics is likely to be opened next year at Paris 7 University.
The hired candidate will work in the laboratory   PPS (Preuves,
Programmes et Systemes), which spreads its interests on both sides of
the correspondence between proofs and programs, covering work on
language design and implementation, rewriting, semantics (and game
semantics in particular), categories, linear logic, realizability,
probabilistic  and topological methods, etc...  See www.pps.jussieu.fr.

The position will be opened around February 2007, with decisions taken
around May 2007, and job starting in September 2007.

But there is a preliminary phase called  ** qualification **, through
which all candidates to academic positions in France have to go.
This procedure consists of an evaluation of both research and teaching
experience of candidates in view of their potential application to a
position in a French university. The first phase of this (rather light)
procedure is opened on September 11, 2006, and

*** closes on October 16, 2006 ***

and is entirely electronical
(http://www.education.gouv.fr/personnel/enseignant_superieur/
enseignant_chercheur/calendrier_qualification.htm).  The section of
qualification should be preferably number 25 (mathe'matiques), but
candidates interested in multiple applications in France, including in
CS departments, may also apply for qualification in section 27
(informatique) simultaneously.

This approaching first deadline is the main reason for the present
early announcement.

A certain fluency in French is required for the position. The teaching
will be in the mathematics department, so some experience in teaching
mathematics (rather than computer science) is welcome  Teaching is in
French.

I invite potential candidates to contact me, and I also encourage
colleagues to point me to interesting potential candidates fitting the
criteria.

Best regards,

Pierre=Louis Curien
