Of course, I entirely agree with the sentiment that epsilon-structures
are completely inappropriate as a basis of most ordinary mathematics.

However, mathematics and mathematicians are contrAry beasts, who
treat any statement of the form "there is no such thing as ..." as a
challenge, whether it be about membership-preserving functions or the
square root of -1.

Indeed, it's quite interesting to look at "carriers equipped with
membership relations" in the same way as "carries equipped with group
multiplications".  This is what I did in my paper "Intuitionistic
Sets and Ordinals", JSL 61 (1996).

For a more categorical treatment, we may regard the relation as a
coalgebra structure for the full covariant powerset functor.  This is
what Gerhard Osius did in his "Categorical Set Theory" in JPAA 4
(1974) and what I did for other functors in my unpublished paper
"Towards a Uniform Treatment of Induction - the General Recusion
Theorem" in 1995-6.  (This was presented at "Category Theory 1995"
in Cambridge and part of it appeared in Section 6.3 of my book.)

As Mike Barr says, and Gerhard Osius proved in his paper, for
"extensional" structures ("well-founded trees subject to the rule that
two > chidren of the same leaf cannot be isomorphic"), the
structure-preserving map must be a subset inclusion.

However, without extensionality, it is a COALGEBRA HOMOMORPHISM.

Well founded coalgebras behave like fragments of the initial algebra
(the von Neumann hierarchy, in the case of the powerset functor), so
their rigidity (lack of endomorphisms) is related to the uniqueness of
homorphisms out of the initial algebra. The sense in which coalgebra
homomorphisms are like partial algebra homomorphisms is explored in
the early sections of my unpublished paper.

Osius's recursion scheme has attracted some attention in recent years
amongst functional programmers as a way of describing recursive
programs.  See "Recursive Coalgebras from Comonads" by Venanzio
Capretta, Tarmo Uustalu and Varmo Vene, in "Information and
Computation" 2006.  In fact, the description also works for
imperative programs - see Section 2.5 of my book.

I have a longer survey of this subject that I intend to publish on
"categories" later this month.

(attributed to Mike Barr) without ever noticing that the
related question, of having two (semi)ring structures =

on the same set, with the same addition, also has answer YES.

For instance, take the additive group of 2x2 matrices with
integer entries (or entries from any semiring) and notice that,
apart from the usual matrix multiplication, there is also
the sophomoric, or pointwise, multiplication (so called since
it is generally only sophomores in the first week of their

two matrices by multiplying their corresponding entries).

Not quite sure though how this impacts the situation with

Dear Paul, as far as i remember model theorists have
an extremely elegant way of comparing structures:
no morphisms there but "games" of finite isomorphism
extensions (see Fraisse' and Ehrenfeucht for the game
aspect or B.Poizat's book)
All the first order syntax is subsumed by those games.
I quite like categories and for sure I do not know everything,
but I have not seen so far a convincing categorical counterpart
for these games.
(And model theory is good stuff!)

Best,
Vincent.

My request for precursors to Mike Barr's deprecation of set membership
seems to have set loose a thread that has veered off from set theory
into model theory.  The following extract from the introduction to
Gerald Sacks' "Saturated Model Theory" (335 pages, W.A. Benjamin, 1972)
serendipitously ties up this loose thread while at the same time
promising that category theory offers deeper insight into categoricity,
a central notion of model theory, than the alternatives.

"It is true that model theory bears a disheartening resemblance to set
theory, a fascinating branch of mathematics with little to say about
fundamental logical questions, and in particular to the arithmetic of
cardinals and ordinals.  But the resemblance is more of manners than of
ideas, because the central notions of model theory are absolute, and
absoluteness, unlike cardinality, is a logical concept.  That is why
model theory does not founder on that rock of undecidability, the
generalized continuum hypothesis, and why the Los conjecture is
decidable: A theory T is k-categorical if all models of T of cardinality
k are isomorphic.  Los conjectured and Morley proved (Theorem 37.4) that
if a countable theory is k-categorical for some uncountable k, then it
is k-categorical for every uncountable k.  The property 'T is
k-categorical for every uncountable k' is of course an absolute property
of T.

The notion of rank of 1-types was invented by Morley to prove Los's
conjecture.  There are proofs of it that make no mention of rank, but
they leave one ill-prepared to prove Shelah's uniqueness theorem
(Section 36).  I have made rank a central idea of the book, because it
is the central idea of current model theory.  ...  Morley's notion of
rank was inspired by the Bendixson differentiation of a closed subset of
a compact Hausdorff space; however, the Morley derivative differs from
the Cantor-Bendixson derivative in that the former commutes with the
inverse limit operation.  The Morley derivative is expounded in section
29 as a transformation which acts on functors of a class common in model
theory.  One advantage of a category theoretic treatment of Morley rank
is that it applies equally well to other notions [Shelah] of rank of
1-types.  Section 25 reviews the apparatus of category theory needed in
section 29."

The difference between this recommendation of category theory for model
theory and (for example) the literature on accessible categories is that
Sacks was not a card-carrying category theorist but a recursion
theorist.  While category theory has no bias towards Goedel's notion of
absoluteness (that I'm aware of), it seems reasonable to infer from
Sacks' acceptance of CT that neither is CT biased away from absoluteness
but rather is a neutral general-purpose tool.

When a Boolean algebra B is treated as a Boolean ring in the usual manner,
the meet is the multiplication. In his little-known thesis, Herbrand noted
that a BA could also be construed as a ring with the join as the
multiplication (see Church's tome on logic). Gian-Carlo Rota noted that both
these Boolean rings were "opposite" quotients of what he called a "valuation
ring" V(B,Z_2) which carries *both* multiplications and one addition. What
is usually called "Boolean duality" (e.g., DeMorgan's law) is an
anti-isomorphism of the valuation ring that swaps the two multiplications
and leaves addition the same. The "trick" in constructing such rings was to
see that the bottom element z (representing the null set) should be a
separate element than the 0 of the ring. The usual Boolean ring constructed
from a BA is really the quotient of the valuation ring that identifies z and
0, i.e., V(B,Z_2)/(z). The Boolean ring noted by Herbrand is the quotient of
the valuation ring that identifies the element representing the top u with
0, i.e., V(B,Z_2)/(u). Remarkably, the valuation ring construction V(L,A)
works for any distributive lattice L and any commutative ring A, not just a
BA B and Z_2 and the anti-isomorphism works just as well. Thus we have
"Boolean duality" over arbitrary commutative rings A; it has nothing to do
with 0-1 nature of Z_2. This general theory of Boolean duality was developed
in a series of papers by Geissinger in Arch. Math. 1973. See Rota's book
"Finite Operator Calculus" for material on valuation rings.

For the opposite question of two additions and one multiplication in a
semi-ring, the natural setting is the algebraic treatment of series addition
a+b and parallel addition a:b = 1/((1/a)+(1/b)) (e.g., from electrical
circuit theory) in what might be called a "series-parallel algebra." Every
commutative group G (written multiplicatively) generates a series-parallel
division algebra SP(G) (think of all series-parallel circuits of resistors
that could be generated with the elements of G as the resistors). It is a
"division algebra" in the sense that the SP algebra is also a multiplicative
group where the inverse of any SP circuit is obtained by taking the
series-parallel conjugate circuit (see any circuit theory book) with the
atomic resistances from G replaced by their inverses in G. Then "taking
reciprocals" is the anti-isomorphism of the SP algebra that swaps the two
additions leaving multiplication the same, and it algebraically captures
series-parallel duality just as the anti-isomorphisms of the valuation rings
captured Boolean duality. The SP algebra SP({1}) of the trivial group is
just the positive rationals Q^+ (i.e., any rational resistance can be
obtained as a series-parallel circuit with unit resistances) and the
anti-isomorphism that swaps the two additions is just "taking the
reciprocal" r-->1/r. There is an 1892 paper by the great combinatorist Percy
MacMahon published in "The Electrician" that explains the notion of a
conjugate of a series-parallel circuit and shows that if each resistence is
1 (i.e., G = {1}) and the compound resistance of an SP circuit is R, then
the resistance of the conjugate SP circuit is 1/R (in case your library does
not carry "The Electrician" from 1892, see the Collected Papers of
MacMahon). Paying attention to the duality of series and parallel addition
on the positive rationals or reals gives some cute dualities. For instance,
instead of saying that the geometric series 1+x+x^2+... converges to 1/(1-x)
for any positive x<1, it is easier to say that 1+(1:x)+(1:x)^2+... converges
to 1+x for any positive x. And dually, the parallel sum infinte series
1:(1+x):(1+x)^2:... converges to 1:x for any positive x.

Both Rota's valuation rings and the series-parallel algebras are explained
in two chapters of my book: "Intellectual Trespassing as a Way of Life:
Essays in Philosophy, Economics, and Mathematics" (Rowman-Littlefield,
1995).

David Ellerman begins,

Boolean algebras actually have the additional surprise that,
because their multiplication (meet) is idempotent (as well as
commutative and associative), it distributes over itself =

( a(bc) =3D (ab)(ac) ) so that one can use multiplication as =

a third addition candidate (the first two having been the =

more usual symmetric difference and join, of course).

Cheers, and Happy Labor Day (in the US, anyway),

Three items with which to follow up on my earlier note,

> For instance, take the additive group of 2x2 matrices with
> integer entries (or entries from any semiring) and notice that,
> apart from the usual matrix multiplication, there is also
> the sophomoric, or pointwise, multiplication ...:

1. In one of the poster sessions at the recent Madrid ICM2006,
Camarero, Etayo, Rovira, and Santamaria remind us that the ordinary
real plane R^2 (with usual vector addition) admits at least

> three distinguished real algebras ... as follows: the set
> {a+bi: a, b {/element} R} with i^2 =3D -1, +1, 0, i.e., the
> complex, double, and dual numbers.

(ICM2006 Abstracts, p. 42)

2. Yefim Katsov (in a telephone conversation) has pointed out
that in any reasonable lattice-ordered (semi-)group, where
a + (b ^ c) =3D (a+b) ^ (a+c) and a + (b v c) =3D (a+b) v (a+c),
one gets two different (semi-)ring structures by using: =

as product, the (semi-)group composition + ; and =

as sum, in one case the lattice meet ^ , alternatively, the join v .

3. A many-objects version can be concocted from example 2 above
by stirring it up with a variant form of Lawvere's observations
about metric spaces being categories enriched over an appropriately
structured closed monoidal version of the poset R+ of nonnegative
real numbers ( order relation > , tensor product + , unit 0 ,
internal hom the positive part of b-a ). =


In detail, if X is a metric space with metric d, consider the
ordinary category _X_ whose objects are the points of X while its
homsets _X_(p, q) are given by the principal filter (in (R, </=3D ) )
generated by d(p, q):

_X_(p, q) =3D { x {/element} R: x >/=3D d(p, q) } .

Composition _X_(p, q) x _X_(q, r) can clearly be given by
sending (x, y) to x+y : for identity map is always the number 0,
and whenever x >/=3D d(p, q) and y >/=3D d(q, r) we must also have
x+y >/=3D d(p, q) + d(q, r) >/=3D d(p, r) .

Thus, arithmetic addition provides a composition rule for _X_ ,
and both real sup and real inf can serve as commutative semigroup
structures (across which composition distributes) on the homsets.

Of course no one will claim _X_ has any finite (co)products; but,
anyway, here any enrichment of _X_ over semigroups is clearly an
added item of structure, and not a property of _X_ .

PS: Katsov has also pointed out that a marvelous little New Yorker
piece of Fields Medal gossip, turning around Yau, Perelman, Hamilton,
and the Poincare conjecture, can be found on the web (for those who
don't take the New Yorker, or even those who do) at:

Mention of the Morley derivative by Vaughan Pratt reminded me of my recent
suspicion that I think would be natural to share here.

Is there a chance to obtain the Morley derivative by performing construction
of the Cantor-Bendixson derivative internally on an appropriately chosen
internal locale in the topos of set-valued functors on an appropriate
subcategory of spaces and continuous maps?

Mathematical Structures in Computer Science

Special Issue on

Isomorphisms of Types and Invertibility of Lambda-Terms

Guest Editors: Ralph Matthes and Sergei Soloviev, Toulouse


Call for contributions

The study of invertibility of lambda-terms and related subjects such
as isomorphisms of types, retractions and subtyping takes an important
place in type theory. It is related to number theory, algebra and
category theory, and it has applications to information retrieval
systems, automatic code generation, data transformation, coding and
cryptography.

This special issue is a continuation of the series opened by the
special issue of MSCS on Isomorphisms of Types published in 2005
(vol. 15, no. 5, Oct. 2005). Partly it is intended as a post-proceedings
of WIT2005, a "Types" workshop at IRIT, Toulouse

     http://www.irit.fr/zeno/WIT2005/,

but the contributions are subject to normal refereeing procedure and
not limited to the papers presented by the participants of that workshop.


Deadlines

Deadline for submissions:     6 December 2006
Author's notification:     4 April 2007
Special issue's publication:     Winter 2007/Spring 2008


Submissions

The submissions should be sent in PDF or Postscript to the guest
editors via email: {matthes, soloviev}@irit.fr.

Extended versions of work previously published in conference
proceedings are eligible for submission but authors should make it
clear how their submission improves upon the conference publication;
in those cases where Cambridge University Press is not the publisher
of the original conference proceedings, authors should take care to
avoid infringing that publisher's copyright. Authors who wish to
discuss potential submissions are encouraged to contact the guest
editors.

The Mathematical Structures in Computer Science journal's policy is to
impose restrictions in advance neither on the number of papers nor
their length. However, as the special issue will contain approximately
180 pages, it is anticipated that it will contain a mixture of papers
of between 15 and 45 pages.

Dear All,

I have been trying to compare the simplicially enriched
category/Segal-category approach to weak categories and the
dg-category/$A_\infty$-category approach coming from derived categories
etc.  It is clear that there is a cobar construction leading from a
dg-cocategory to a dg-category and results on twisting cochains also go
across with no difficulty.  I am therefore surprised that I cannot find
an explicit reference for this in the literature (probably I have not
loked in the right place as it is in an `overlap' area!).  Can anyone
help with some good references?

Also has anyone given a good interpretation of the twisting cochains and
the twisted tensor of modules in this setting.  I know of the usual
interpretations.  Perhaps someone who knows the string theoretic links
may have an idea.

Thanks,

Tim Porter

Dear all,

This is to announce the availability of a preprint
"Connections and path connections in groupoids".

Abstract:

We describe two gauge theoretic notions of connection in a
(differentiable) groupoid. The two notions are related via the notion
of holonomy. Holonomy formation (integration) is shown to be inverse
of a certain differentiation process.
The method is that of Synthetic Differential Geometry, notably in the
form of "First Neighbourhood of the Diagonal".

The preprint can be dowlnoaded from

This announces the release of Easik, a Java application providing a
graphical design environment for Entity-Attribute (EA) sketches.  These
sketches are the syntactic basis for the categorical Sketch Data Model
(SkDM) which extends and enhances the standard Entity-Relationship-Attribute
data model.

For extensive information about the Sketch Data Model consult the web
sites of the poster and Michael Johnson.

Complementing its graphical interface, Easik can save an EA sketch
design into an XML document which is exportable to a database schema in
SQL. The schema includes triggers and procedures to enforce the
constraints defined graphically. Easik provides connectivity to common
database management systems via JDBC.

The application is available for download at

http://mathcs.mta.ca/research/rosebrugh/Easik

or follow links from

http://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/

Instructions for using Easik are are on the Web pages:
- users may download a Java archive (jar file) providing the application and
- source code is available.

Easik was developed by Robert Fletcher, Kevin Green, Vera Ranieri and
Robert Rosebrugh with support from NSERC Canada and Mount Allison
University.

We are interested comments from users, and would also appreciate receiving
reports of difficulties with function or usability.

Second announcement


Dear Colleagues, the Workshop will be held at the Department of
Mathematics of the Universit=E0 degli Studi of Milan, from 26th to 28th o=
f
October, 2006.

The purpose of the workshop is to consider the notion of internal action
in different categorical contexts and to relate it with internal
structures defined thereby.
In particular, the well established context of semiabelian categories
provides a natural setting for studying  the interplay between
categorical and algebraic aspects of actions, with respect to internal
structures that may be defined.

The workshop is intended to reflect its etymology, in order to give the
participants a fruitful opportunity of debate and exchange experiences
about the subject.

NEWS:

The web pages

http://users.mat.unimi.it/users/mantovani/workshopMi06.htm

have been updated and now they include:

- an online inscription form to partecipate to the workshop
- abstracts of the lectures

PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC

        84th meeting - second announcement

Dear Colleagues,

As most of you will already know, the 84th meeting of the seminar=3D20
takes place at the Department of Theoretical Computer Science of the
Technical University Braunschweig, Germany, over the weekend of
October 14-15, 2006.  As always, the seminar welcomes talks using or
addressing category theory or logic, either explicitly or implicitly,
in the study of any aspect of mathematics or science.

Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke have agreed to give a series of three
lectures on catgorical aspects of quantum informatics.  In addition,
we can now confirm the participation of professor Reinhard Werner,
mathematical physicist at the TU Braunschweig with special interest in
this field.

Braunschweig is located about 60 km East of Hannover and about 200 km
West of Berlin.  It can easily be reached by car or train.  The
closest airport is in Hannover; the train to Hannover's main
station takes about 20 minutes, and the train from there to
Braunschweig takes about 40 minutes.

Further information on the location of the seminar, along with details
on local travel together with an online registration form can be found
at

=09http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/TI-INFO/koslowj/PSSL84.html

You will also find links to two hotels offering special university
rates, but you should register by the end of September.

Dear category theorist-

Below is a reminder for the "Summer School on Contemporary Categorical=20
Methods in Algebra and Topology". Anybody interested to participate in=20
the School is encouraged to email me before the end of this month.=20
Suggestions for contributed papers will also be considered by the=20
Scientific Committee. The info is also available on my webpage at
http://www.math.yorku.ca/~tholen/

Regards,
Walter Tholen.


                                              SUMMER SCHOOL ON
 CONTEMPORARY CATEGORICAL METHODS IN ALGEBRA AND TOPOLOGY

                                    Haute-Bodeux, Belgium, 3-10 June 2007

In the tradition of previous meetings held at this location, a Summer=20
School on Contemporary Categorical Methods in Algebra and Topology will=20
be held in Haute-Bodeux, a village in the Ardennes region of south-east=20
Belgium, from June 3 (arrival day) until June 10, 2007 (departure day).=20
Participants will stay in the "Hostellerie Doux-Repos"

http://hotels.belgium-bookings.com/hotel/be/hostellerie-doux-repos.html?l=
abel=3Dgl-hotels-Hostellerie-Doux-Repos

or nearby guestrooms, all meals will be taken in the Hostellerie - which=20
is known for its excellent cuisine. The primary aim of the meeting is to=20
provide students and young researchers who already have a working=20
knowledge of categories with an opportunity to learn about various=20
topics of interest in categorical algebra and topology, including

- categorical and topological aspects of semi-abelian theories,
- categorical descent and Galois theory,
- accessible categories and their applications to homotopy theory,
- lax-algebraic methods in categorical topology.

However, more established researchers in nearby fields who wish to=20
enhance their knowledge on these topics or present a paper are also=20
welcome. Lecture series will be given by the following researchers who=20
constitute the Scientific Committee of the meeting:

- Maria Manuel Clementino
- Dominique Bourn
- George Janelidze
- Jiri Rosicky
- Walter Tholen.

The local organizer of the Summer School is Francis Borceux (Universit=E9=
=20
Catholique de Louvain). It is estimated that the total cost of the=20
meeting will be about 975 Euros per person: this covers the registration=20
fee, transportation from and to Brussels airport or Li=E8ge railway=20
station (on the designated arrival and departure days), accommodation=20
and meals (including conference dinner and drinks with meals), social=20
activities and an excursion (excluding dinner on the excursion day).=20
Unfortunately, the organizers do not have funds available to provide any=20
financial support.

Accommodation in Haute-Bodeux is strictly limited, and attendance at the=20
meeting will be by invitation only. However, anyone who wishes to be=20
considered for invitation, or to propose names of people who might be=20
invited, is asked to send an e-mail to Walter Tholen=20
<tholen@mathstat.yorku.ca> <mailto:tholen@mathstat.yorku.ca> before the=20
end of September 2006. It is expected that invitations will be sent out=20
early in November 2006. Those invited will be sent formal letters of=20
invitation to assist them in obtaining funding, and will also be=20
provided with a reading list of material which may be assumed in the=20
Summer School lectures.

             Partially Supported by US Office of Naval Research


The Twenty-third Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics (MFPS XXIII) will take place on the campus of
Tulane University, New Orleans, LA USA from Wednesday, April 11
through Saturday, April 14, 2007.

The MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics,
logic, and computer science which are related to models of
computation, in general, and to the semantics of programming
languages, in particular. The series has particularly stressed
providing a forum where researchers in mathematics and computer
science can meet and exchange ideas about problems of common
interest.  As the series also strives to maintain breadth in its
scope, the conference strongly encourages participation by
researchers in neighboring areas.

The INVITED SPEAKERS for MFPS XXIII are

       Gerard Berry (Esterel Technologies)
       --- to be confirmed ---

       Stephen Brookes (CMU)

       Jane Hillston (Edinburgh)

       John Mitchell (Stanford)

       Gordon Plotkin (Edinburgh)

       John Power (Edinburgh)

In addition, there will be three special sessions:

    1. A special session honoring GORDON PLOTKIN on his 60th birthday
       year, organised by Samson Abramsky (Oxford).

    2. A special session on SECURITY, organised by Catherine Meadows
(NRL).

    3. A special session on SYSTEMS BIOLOGY, organised by Jane
       Hillston (Edinburgh) and Prakash Panangaden (McGill).

   4.  A Special Session on Physics, Information and Computation
        organized by Keye Martin (NRL).

Further, there will be a TUTORIAL DAY on April 11.  The topic will be
Domain Theory; the speakers will be announced at a later date.  This
event will be free to those who are interested in attending.

The remainder of the program will consist of papers selected by the
following PROGRAM COMMITTEE

Am I right in believing that geometric categories (Elephant A 1.4.18)
need not be balanced? (I don't know a counterexample - the geometric
categories that I can think of are all toposes.)

The reason I ask is this. One is (or certainly I am) used to thinking
of geometric logic as the logic of Grothendieck toposes. Grothendieck
toposes are balanced, and consequently a sound reasoning principle in
their internal logic is that functions are equivalent to total,
single-valued relations. One therefore thinks of this as a principle
of geometric reasoning. However, I suspect it doesn't follow just
from the pure logic - the connectives and inference rules -  of
geometric logic. This would be verified if there are unbalanced
geometric categories, since the pure logic is interpretable in
arbitrary geometric categories. I would take this as indicating that
we want geometric logic to be more than just what the pure logic says
it is.

The Elephant gives two different definitions of geometric theory: by
the pure logic in D 1.1.6, and by a more general notion of geometric
construct in B 4.2.7. It asserts their equivalence, but I think this
must be with respect to a semantics already presumed to be in
Grothendieck toposes.

Steve Vickers.

Of course -- (cocomplete) quasitoposes are geometric categories as well,
and they needn't be balanced. Incidentally, Gordon Monro wrote a couple
of papers about the interpretation of logic in quasitoposes, which
appeared in JPAA 42 (1986).

I've never really found a satisfactory conceptual explanation of why
these two definitions come out equivalent. Undoubtedly it's connected
with the fact that, in the recursive definition, one is thinking in
terms of interpretations in geometric categories, but is there more to it
than that?

   Identity Types - Topological and Categorical Structure

      Workshop, November 13-14, 2006, Uppsala University.


The identity type, the type of proof objects for the
fundamental propositional equality, is one of the most
intriguing constructions of intensional dependent type
theory (also known as Martin-L=F6f type theory). Its complexity
became apparent with the Hofmann-Streicher groupoid model
of type theory. This model also hinted at some possible
connections between type theory and homotopy theory and
higher categories. Exploration of his connection is intended
to be the main theme of this workshop.

Preliminary list of speakers

   Steve Awodey (Pittsburgh)
   Peter Dybjer (G=F6teborg)
   Richard Garner (Uppsala)
   Martin Hyland (Cambridge, to be confirmed)
   Per Martin-L=F6f (Stockholm)
   Thomas Streicher (Darmstadt)
   Michael A Warren (Pittsburgh)


A final list of speakers will be prepared shortly before
the workshop.  If you are interested in giving a talk, please
submit a short abstract to the organiser before October 25.
The working days of the meeting are November 13 and
November 14 until noon.

Marco Grandis and Walter Tholen: Natural weak factorization systems

Abstract. In order to facilitate a natural choice for morphisms created
by the (left or right) lifting property as used in the definition of
weak factorization systems, the notion of natural weak factorization
system in the category K is introduced, as a pair (comonad, monad) over
K^2. The link with existing notions in terms of morphism classes is
given via the respective Eilenberg-Moore categories.

-------------------------------------

Jiri Rosicky and Walter Tholen: Factorization, fibration and torsion

Abstract.  A simple definition of torsion theory is presented, as a
factorization system with both classes satisfying the 3-for-2 property.
Comparisons with the traditional notion are given, as well as
connections with the notions of fibration and of weak factorization
system, as used in abstract homotopy theory.

-------------------------------------

Eraldo Giuli and Walter Tholen: A topologist's view of Chu spaces

Abstract. For a symmetric monoidal-closed category X and any object K,
the category of K-Chu spaces is small-topological over X and
small-cotopological over X^op. It's full subcategory of M-extensive
K-Chu spaces is topological over X when X is M-complete, for any
morphism class M. Often they form a full coreflective subcategory of
Diers' category of affine K-spaces. Hence, in addition to their roots
in in the theory of pairs of topological vector spaces (Barr) and in
the study of event structures for modeling concurrent processes
(Pratt), Chu spaces seem to have a less explored link with algebraic
geometry. We use the Zariski closure operator to characterize the
self-dual category of M-extensive and M-coextensive K-Chu spaces.
