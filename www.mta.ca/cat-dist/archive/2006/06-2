Jean Benabou seems to have invented so many things but, like Al Gore,
he did not invent the internet. He seems to have difficulty with
upper and lower case letter issues. If objects are denoted by upper
case then in in email text it is a reasonable convention to use lower
case for 1-cells, upper case for 2-cells, and so on. He should also
be told that ordinary words written in upper case are understood to be
SHOUTED. (Most of us do not read anything that is shouted.)

Dear Jean (and dear colleagues),

Everyone knows you defined bicategories (and Charles Ehresmann 2-
categories). The point of those two messages is that one can
equivalently define a 2-category or a bicategory using the following
primitive operations (and suitable axioms):

- the vertical composition of cells,
- the whisker composition of cells with maps (instead of the
horizontal composition of cells).

  (Which is precisely what we concretely do in Cat, when we define
horizontal composition of natural transformations: we use vertical
composition and whiskering, showing that the two possible ways of
defining horizontal composition give the same result, by the relevant
part of the middle-four interchange axiom - which I was calling
"reduced interchange".)

All this has some importance in homotopy, which is why I was
interested in it. For instance, take chain complexes with their
homotopies: then the vertical composition of homotopies is (strictly)
associative, whiskering is also associative (in the appropriate
sense), but reduced interchange fails and you do not have a
horizontal composition of homotopies. Such a structure is a sesqui-
category in Ross Street's sense - actually one might say "sesqui-
groupoid".

With best regards

Marco

Dear All,

I just put a paper up at http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0602053 .
It should be of interest to many. It uses coherence rules to tell when two
programs are essentially the same algorithm.

Here is the title and abstract:

Towards a Definition of an Algorithm


We define an algorithm to be the set of programs that implement or express
that algorithm. The set of all programs is partitioned into equivalence
classes. Two programs are equivalent if they are ``essentially'' the same
program. The set of all equivalence classes is the category of all
algorithms. In order to explore these ideas, the set of primitive recursive
functions is considered. Each primitive recursive function can be described
by many labeled binary trees that show how the function is built up. Each
tree is like a program that shows how to compute a function. We give
relations that say when two such trees are ``essentially'' the same. An
equivalence class of such trees will be called an algorithm. Universal
properties of the category of all algorithms are given.


Looking forward to hearing any thoughts and criticisms.

I hope to see you all in Nova Scotia at CT 2006 this Summer!

All the best,
Noson (Yanofsky)

Dear All,

        PSSL 84 - preliminary announcement
        http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/TI-INFO/koslowj/PSSL84.html

The 84th meeting of the seminar will be held at the Department of
Theoretical Computer Science of the Technical University in
Braunschweig, Germany, over the weekend of October 14/15, 2006.  The
seminar welcomes talks using or addressing category theory or logic,
either explicitly or implicitly, in the study of any aspect of
mathematics or science.  This will be a fairly informal affair,=20
presentations of work in progress are quite acceptable.

Braunschweig is located about 60 km East of Hannover and can easily be
reached by car or train.  The closest airport is in Hannover.  Since
Expo 2000, there is a fast train connection from that airport to
Hannover's main train station.  Trains to Braunschweig leave at least=20
once every hour and take about 40 minutes or less. =20

Further information will become available on the web-page listed above,
where you can also register on-line.

While making a web search I came across an old message by Paul Levy. He
had originally asked (in message
200111201650.fAKGol115859@foobar.pps.jussieu.fr
<http://north.ecc.edu/alsani/ct01%289-12%29/msg00071.html>):

 > If P and Q are objects in a 2-category C, and there is an equivalence
 > between them, must there be an adjoint equivalence (an adjunction
 > whose unit and counit are both isomorphisms) between them?"

After the answer was given he revealed the motivation for his question:

> I'm trying to make an argument that the natural 2-categorical
> analogue of isomorphism is adjoint equivalence rather than
> equivalence, but your result suggests that it doesn 't matter.

I am currently wondering about a closely related observation. While
playing around with the notion of 2-transport, I noticed that, contrary
to my original assumption, in order for a certain 2-functor to be
expressible in terms of another 2-functor (to be "locally trivializable"
in my application) it suffices for both 2-functors to be related by a
"special ambidextrous adjunction".

By a special ambidextrous adjunction I mean an ambidextrous adjunction

 A --L--> B -- R --> A

such that

 1 ==> LR ==> 1

and

 1 ==> RL ==> 1

are identity 2-morphisms.

This is strictly weaker than an adjoint equivalence.

(I have chosen the adjective "special" in order to allude to the fact
that the Frobenius algebras obtained from these adjunctions are called
"special Frobenius algebras".)

I would like to know if there are any well known insights concerning
such "special ambidextrous adjunctions".

P.S.

There are notes with more details and examples here:

My colleague Klaus Keimel has the following question and would be glad
if someone could answer it.
If you want to answer him directly his e-mail address is

   keimel@mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de

I have come across a different, but similar question concerning the
distribution monad on Froelicher spaces (as studied by Froelicher, Kriegl
and Michor). Can one characterize elementarily the algebras for the monad
T(X) = Lin(R^X,R) on \SS, the cartesian closed category of Froelicher
spaces and "smooth" maps between them? I guess smooth and linear is not
sufficient...

Thomas Streicher


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The monad of probability measures over compact Hausdorf spaces

If we assign to every compact Hausdorff space X the set PX of all
probability measures on X endowed with the vague (= weak*topology if
we consider PX embedded in the dual of C(X)), then we have a monad.
The unit e assign the Dirac measure to every point x in X, the
multiplication m assigns the barycentre of every probability measure
on PX.

My question is: What are the algebras and the algebra homomorphisms
of this monad?

It should be straightforward, that compact convex sets in locally
convex vector spaces are algebras. Probability measures on such spaces
have a barycentre. Continuous affine maps should be homomorphisms.

Are these all algebras and homomorphisms?

One thinks that this should be known. Who knows about this? I would be
interested in hints and in relevant references.

CONCUR 2006, the  17th International Conference on Concurrency Theory,
will take place in Bonn, Germany, August 27 - 30, 2006. The purpose of
the CONCUR conferences is to bring together researchers working on the
theory of concurrency and its applications.

Submissions  are  solicited in  all  areas  of  semantics, logics, and
verification techniques  for  concurrent systems. The principal topics
include (but are not limited to):

* Basic  models  and  logics of concurrent and distributed computation
  (such as process  algebras,  Petri  nets, domain  theoretic  or game
  theoretic models, modal and temporal logics).

* Specialized models or classes of systems (such as circuits, synchro-
  nous systems, real time and hybrid systems, stochastic systems, data
  bases, mobile and  migrating systems, parametric protocols, security
  protocols).

* Related  verification  techniques and tools (such as state-space ex-
  ploration,  model-checking,  synthesis,  abstraction,  automated de-
  duction, testing).

* Related programming models  (such as distributed, constraints or ob-
  ject oriented,  graph rewriting, as well as associated type systems,
  static analyses, abstract machines, and environments).

Authors  are  invited to submit an extended abstract; submissions will
be  evaluated  by  the  program  committee  for  inclusion in the pro-
ceedings,  which  will be published by Springer-Verlag  in the Lecture
Notes  in  Computer Science series. Papers must  contain original con-
tributions, be clearly  written, and  include appropriate reference to
and comparison with related work. Simultaneous  submission to journals
or other conferences with published proceedings is not allowed.

Authors are required to submit a paper title  and a short abstract be-
fore submitting  the extended abstract. The short abstract  should not
exceed 200 words, and it should be entered  in ASCII at the conference
web site.  The extended abstract  should not  exceed 15 pages,  and it
should be  formatted according  to Springer-Verlag LNCS guidelines. If
necessary, the  extended abstract  may be  supplemented with a clearly
marked appendix,  which will be reviewed at the discretion of the pro-
gram committee. The link for submission will be  available at the web-
site: http://depend.cs.uni-sb.de/concur06

Concerning Thomas Streicher's question about the internal linear
functional (=distribution of compact support) monad on Froelicher's smooth
category : see volume 1 of the journal Functional Analysis for two papers
by Waelbroeck which show that the algebras are essentially determined by
complete bornological spaces.

Concerning Klaus Keimel's question about "abstract" compact convex sets, I
do not recall a precise reference but is seems that Linton or Semadeni or
both proved that they all do embed in locally convex linear spaces. This
of course is in contrast with the noncompact finitary part of the
probability theory, where there are those special algebras which are often
discarded as spurious, but which in fact by a very natural adjoint to an
algebraic functor record the face structure of any convex set as a
semilattice. That raises the question: is there no equally natural way to
record face structure for COMPACT convex sets ?

                           CMCS 2006

8th International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science
        http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/cmcs06/cmcs06.html

                         Vienna, Austria                        March
25-27, 2006

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 9th European Joint
Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software ETAPS 2006
          March 25 - April 2, 2006

Aims and Scope

During the last few years, it has become increasingly clear that a
great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition
systems, automata, process calculi and class-based systems, can be
captured uniformly as coalgebras.  Coalgebra is developing into a
field of its own interest presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a
growing field of applications and interactions with various other
fields such as reactive and interactive system theory, object oriented
and concurrent programming, formal system specification, modal logic,
dynamical systems, control systems, category theory, algebra,
analysis, etc. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its
applications.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

      the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and
      categorical approaches);
      coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for
      programming languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
      coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent)
programming;      coalgebras and data types;      (coinductive)
definition and proof principles for coalgebras
      (with bisimulations or invariants);
      coalgebras and algebras;      coalgebraic specification and
verification;      coalgebras and (modal) logic;      coalgebra and
control theory (notably of discrete event and
hybrid systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, Genova, Grenoble, Warsaw and Barcelona. The
proceedings appeared as Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer
Science (ENTCS) Volumes 11,19, 33, 41, 65.1, 82.1 and 106. You can get
an idea of the types of papers presented at the meeting by looking at
the tables of contents of the ENTCS volumes from those workshops ENTCS


Location

CMCS 2006 will be held in Vienna on March 25-27, 2006. It will be a
satellite workshop of ETAPS 2006, the European Joint Conferences on
Theory and Practice of Software.


Programme Committee

John Power (chair,Edinburgh), Luis Barbosa (Minho), Neil Ghani
(Nottingham), H. Peter Gumm (Marburg), Marina Lenisa (Udine), Stefan
Milius (Braunschweig), Larry Moss (Bloomington), Jan Rutten
(Amsterdam), Hendrik Tews (Dresden), Tarmo Uustalu (Tallinn), Hiroshi

Submissions

Two sorts of submissions will be possible this year:

Papers to be evaluated by the programme committee for inclusion in the
ENTCS proceedings:
            These papers must be written using ENTCS style files and be
of length
no greater than 20 pages. They must contain original contributions, be
clearly written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison
with related work. If a submission describes software, software tools,
or their use, it should include all source code that is needed to
reproduce the results but is not publicly available. If the additional
material exceeds 5 MB, URL's of publicly available sites should be
provided in the paper.

Short contributions:            These will not be published but will be
compiled into a technical
report of the University of Nottingham. They should be no more than
two pages and may describe work in progress, summarise work submitted
to a conference or workshop elsewhere, or in some other way appeal to
the CMCS audience.

Both sorts of submission should be submitted in postscript or pdf form
as attachments to an email to cmcs06@cs.nott.ac.uk.  The email should
include the title, corresponding author, and, for the first kind of
submission, a text-only one-page abstract.

After the workshop, we expect to produce a journal proceedings of
extended versions of selected papers to appear in Theoretical Computer
Science.

Dear All,

I would need please a bibliographical reference for the following fact :

"Let C be a complete cocomplete cartesian closed category.  Let I be a small
category. Then the category of functors C^I is cartesian closed."

(If Hom is the internal hom functor of C, let Hom(X_*,Y_*)=\int_i
Hom(X_i,Y_i) ; then the internal hom of C^I is defined by HOM(X_*,Y_*)_j= j
|-> Hom(X_* x 1[j], Y_*) where 1 is the terminal object of C and Z |-> Z[j]
is left adjoint to the i-th evaluation functor X_* |-> X_j)

Thanks in advance. pg.

BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE
=========================

Computer security is an established field of computer science of both
theoretical and practical significance. In recent years, there has been
increasing interest in logic-based foundations for various methods in
computer security, including the formal specification, analysis and
design of security protocols and their applications, the formal
definition of various aspects of security such as access control
mechanisms, mobile code security and denial-of-service attacks, and the
modeling of information flow and its application to confidentiality
policies, system composition, and covert channel analysis.

The workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is the fusion of two workshops. The workshop
FCS continues a tradition, initiated with the Workshops on Formal
Methods and Security Protocols (FMSP) in 1998 and 1999, then with the
Workshop on Formal Methods and Computer Security (FMCS) in 2000, and
finally with the LICS satellite Workshop on Foundations of Computer
Security (FCS) in 2002 through 2005, of bringing together formal methods
and the security community.

The ARSPA workshop is the third in a series of workshops on Automated
Reasoning for Security Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers
and practitioners from both the security and the formal methods
communities, from academia and industry, who are working on developing
and applying automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal
specification and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA
workshops were held as satellite events of IJCAR'04 and of ICALP'05,
respectively.

The aim of the joint workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is to provide a forum for
continued activity in these areas, to bring computer security
researchers in closer contact with the LICS community, and to give LICS
attendees an opportunity to talk to experts in computer security. We
thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work and on work in
progress.

We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques
and tools for the formal specification and analysis of security
protocols.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

Automated reasoning techniques       Access control and resource usage control
Composition issues                   Authentication
Formal specification                 Availability and denial of service
Foundations of verification          Covert channels

Dear Friends and Colleagues!

I will be speaking categories and categorical education but let me begin
with technology.

We have been using virtual classrooms now for quite a while. It's useful
for courses at all level, distant supervision can be carried out, etc.
You can even do research collaboration in this way. Many already do, with
different ambitions concerning technology and content. I am sure that I am
not aware of on-going processes, and if any reader already has gone far
beyond this, please stop reading and accept my apology for this spam mail.

I am not speaking NetMeeting or Skype where you only have audio and video
transmission. We are using Marratech where you have whiteboards and shared
applications. In particular, the whiteboard is very useful as you can have
many of them at the same time, and what is next best, you can save the
whiteboard files and use/update them online before and after meetings,
i.e. you can prepare your agenda/slides and the whiteboard prior to coming
together in the virtual classroom.

The best thing is that the Marratech client is free of charge. The server
is rather costly but we have one in Umea and I would like to make this
available for Virtual Cat Th Education.

Basic and Advanced courses in category theory both for mathematicians,
but also, as in my case, for computer scientists.

I came to this idea now when I am trying to recruit interest in my own
department for these topics. E.g. I want to do some basic things with
categories, functors, and natural transformations. From there monads are
rather close by. Further, I want to teach topoi/toposes and also say some
words on \lambda-calculi. Universal algebra, categorically, is a further
priority. Etc etc.

***

Anybody out there sharing these ideas? Can we develop something together?
The problem often being that each and every site may come up with 4-7
students, but combining 4-5 sites gives a nice classroom. And, of course,
teaching can be shared. Joint lecture notes would be important, I
believe. Etc etc.

Drop me a message if you are interested in developing these ideas further.

Cheers,

Patrik

As has already been pointed out here, Vladimir Voevodsky is giving
lectures at Stanford on the "homotopy lambda calculus":

http://math.stanford.edu/distinguished_voevodsky.htm

Can anyone report on what he said?

Phil Scott has been teaching me about the lambda calculus
and related stuff.  He noted that in getting a cartesian
closed category from intuitionistic logic, one takes sequents

Gamma |- Delta

as objects and *equivalence classes* of proofs as morphisms.
One needs to take equivalence classes to get composition of
morphisms to be associative, etc.  From an n-categorical
viewpoint it's natural to avoid working with equivalence classes
and instead use 2-morphisms between morphisms, like associators,
and so on, thus getting a "weak cartesian closed omega-category" -
a concept which, alas, has probably not been defined yet.

For someone like Voevodsky it would be natural to use ideas from
homotopy theory instead and define something like a "cartesian
closed category up to coherent homotopy".  Such a thing should
be lurking in the ordinary typed lambda calculus.

Is this what Voevodsky is talking about?  Or...?

Best,
jb

                      CALL FOR PAPERS

                        Workshop on
      Mathematically Structured Functional Programming
                         MSFP 2006

              Kuressaare, Estonia, 2 July 2006

             http://cs.ioc.ee/mpc-amast06/msfp/


              a satellite workshop of MPC 2006
          a "small workshop" of the TYPES project


Background

Something wonderful happened when monads arrived in Haskell: some
human mathematics explaining the structure of certain computational
phenomena became a mechanical means to implement those phenomena. It's
a good way to go about functional programming - to dig out the
mathematical structure underlying a problem and set it to work!
There's more where monads came from, and we want it. This new workshop
is about getting it.

In recent years, a diverse array of mathematical structures has
appeared in our programs: monads dualise to comonads and generalise to
Freyd categories aka 'arrows'; 'container' types have a generalised
polynomial structure supporting generic programming, not to mention a
differential calculus; isomorphisms from 'high school algebra' are
used to search libraries and repair type errors; coalgebras give
structure to recursion; the list goes on... MSFP is broad in scope,
covering the extraction of functionality from structure wherever it
can be found. It complements the remit of its host conference,
Mathematics of Program Construction, by seeking to enrich the language
and toolset available for specifications and programs alike. It is
also a "small workshop" of the FP6 IST coordination action TYPES.

I don't know about the omega-wheel, but at least the 2-wheel needs not be
reinvented. For "cartesian closed 2-categories", a relevant reference is

  R.A.G. Seely, "Modelling computations: A 2-categorical framework". In
  Proceedings of the Second Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, pages
  61--71, IEEE Computer Science Press, June 1987.

I believe the above paper is "the first" on this topic (am I wrong?), and
there must be more recent work. I know Neil Ghani did some, but Google also
knows about "2-Lambda Calculus" by David Rydeheard, see
http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~david/publications/TwoLambdaCalculus.ps .

Dirk Kreimer and Alain Connes have developed a Hopf algebraic description of
the process of renormalization in quantum field theory.

Their starting point is the definition of a certain algebra structure on the
space of all (Feynman-)graphs.  The definition can be found, for instance,
in equation (6) of http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0510202 .

I suspect that this algebra is most elegantly expressed as the
"multicategory algebra" of the obvious multicategory of (Feynman-)graphs.
This multicategory should be the obvious slight generalization of example
4.2.14 in Tom Leinster's book http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0305049 .

Here by "multicategory algebra" I mean a generalization to multicategories
of the concept "category algebra" or "path algebra" of an ordinary category.
I.e. the algebra generated by the morphisms in the category with the product
derived from the composition law in the category.

(Hence, in particular I am *not* referring to the concept "algebra *for* a
multicategory" as in "algebra for an operad", discussed in section 4.3 of
Leinster's book.)

I would think such a concept of a multicategory(-path-)algebra should exist
and should be given by the obvious generalization of formula (6) in the
above cited paper.

This concept seems to be so natural that I expect it must have been
considered before. If so, could anyone point me to relevant sources?

  To all planning to attend CT06:

     Please note that the general deadline for abstracts, February 27th,
is almost here.  There appears to be a significant number of people
intending to speak who have not yet submitted their abstracts.

     Legitimate submissions for the Eilenberg-Mac Lane commemorative
session are welcome up to March 15th. However, we would ask people
wishing to talk on a topic without particularly strong "Eilenberg-Mac
Lane" connections (and category theory has taken many new directions
since the heyday of our founders) not to use this as an excuse for late
submission; it is not fair to the hard-worked scientific committee.

     Also, while the list of participants who have already booked at
White Point has gratifyingly many familiar names (thank you!), we  have
noted that many who we expect to see in June have _not_ yet booked.  The
management at White Point may not be as used as we are to the
categorical habit of leaving these things till the last minute, and are
starting to get a little concerned, wondering if they will have to
release some of the rooms in our block booking to the general public.
Remember, the earlier you book, the better the choice of rooms/cabins;
this will be especially true if White Point do have to release some
units, when the choice available may drop sharply.

     With apologies,

         The Organizing Committee

At the risk of boring people by repeating a point I've made on this list
before:

a model of intuitionistic logic is a *bi*cartesian closed category.

I see no reason to regard disjunction as more "peripheral" to
intuitionistic logic than implication.  (And, likewise, no reason to
regard sum types as more peripheral to simple type theory than function
types.)  Does anybody disagree?

Ccc's without coproducts (e.g. domains and continuous maps) arise in the
study of call-by-name languages with effects (e.g. divergence).  But they
are not models of intuitionistic logic.

I appreciate that all John said was that a model constructed from syntax
is a ccc, which is true because it's a bi-ccc, so he didn't actually
contradict this point.

The original intuitionists did, of course, see such reasons. But for
those who don't care about such issues as the nature of mathematical
existence there's this reason: if by a *bi*cartesian closed category
one were to mean a ccc category whose dual is also ccc then one would
be stuck with that fact that all *bi*cartesian closed categories are
just pre-ordered sets.

The status of disjunction and sum types in the presence of function
types is, indeed, significantly different from the status of
conjunction and products types.

Let me take the occasion to record a factoid I don't think I ever had
an excuse to record before (and don't really have one now). Define the
notion of a Heyting semi-lattice (HSL) by removing disjunction and
bottom from the definition of Heyting algebra. Define a _linear_ HSL
as one that satisfies the further equation

    ((x -> y) -> z) ^ ((y -> x) -> z)  =  z

e.g. any linearly ordered set with top (indeed, every linear HSL is
representable as a sub HSL of a product of linear ones).

In a linear HSL one may construct disjunction as

    ((x -> y) -> y) ^ ((y -> x) -> x)

The factoid of interest is this sort-of converse: the only HSL
varieties in which every member is a lattice are varieties of linear
HSLs.

                      3rd International Workshop on
                     Web Services and Formal Methods
                              (WS-FM 2006)
                 8-9 September 2006, Vienna, Austria
                       http://cs.unibo.it/ws-fm06

             Official event of "The Process Modelling Group"
                 http://www.process-modelling-group.org

                        Co-located with BPM 2006
      4th International Conference on Business Process Management
                       http://bpm2006.tuwien.ac.at

SCOPE

  Web Services technology aims at providing standard mechanisms for
  describing the interface and the services available on the web, as well
  as protocols for locating such services and invoking them (e.g. WSDL,
  UDDI, SOAP). Innovations are mainly devoted to the definition of
  standards that support the specification of complex services out of
  simpler ones (the so called Web Service orchestration and
  choreography). Several proposals have been already set up: BPML, XLANG
  and BizTalk, WSFL, WS-BPEL, WS-CDL, etc...

  Formal methods, which provide formal machinery for representing and
  analysing the behavior of communicating concurrent/distributed systems,
  are playing a fundamental role in the development of such
  innovations. First of all they are exploited to understand the basic
  mechanisms (in terms of semantics) which characterize different
  orchestration and choreography languages and to focus on the essence
  of new features that are needed. Secondly they provide a formal
  basis for reasoning about Web Service semantics (behaviour and
  equivalence): e.g. for realizing registry services where retrieval
  is based on the meaning and behaviour of a service and not just a
  Web Service name. Thirdly, the studies on formal coordination paradigms
  can be exploited for developing mechanisms for complex run-time Web
  Service coordination. Finally, given the importance of critical
  application areas for Web Services like E-commerce, the development of
  the Web Service technology can certainly take advantage from formal
  analisys of security properties and performance in concurrency theory.

  The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers working on Web
  Services and Formal Methods in order to facilitate fruitful
  collaboration in this direction of research. This, potentially, could
  also have a great impact on the current standardization phase of Web
  Service technologies.

LIST OF TOPICS

  The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

    - Protocols and standards for WS (SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, etc... )
    - Languages and description methodologies for
      Coreography/Orchestration/Workflow
      (BPML, XLANG and BizTalk, WSFL, WS-BPEL, WS-CDL, YAWL, etc... )
    - Coordination techniques for WS
      (transactions, agreement, coordination services, etc...)
    - Semantics-based dynamic WS discovery services
      (based on Semantic Web/Ontology techniques or other semantic
      theories)
    - Security, Performance Evaluation and Quality of Service of WS
    - Semi-structured data and XML related technologies

SUBMISSIONS

  Submissions must be original and should not have been published
  previously or be under consideration for publication while being
  evaluated for this workshop.

  We encourage also the submission of tool papers, describing tools
  based on formal methods, to be exploited in the context of Web Services
  applications.

  Papers are to be prepared in LNCS format and must not exceed
  15 pages. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings
  as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

  As done for previous editions of the workshop, we intend to publish a
  journal special issue inviting full versions of papers selected among
  those presented at the workshop.

Can you explain the "of course" here, please?  What were these reasons,
and do they still hold water? I would have thought that tuples pose
less of an ontological difficulty than functions.

What I meant was cartesian closed category with finite coproducts.

I don't know what you mean - maybe that product types are more similar to
function types than sum types are?  If so, I agree, but I was comparing
function types with sum types, not (function and sum) with (function and
product).

Paul Levy asks how the original intuitionists viewed disjunction. I
don't know how to say it better than this paragraph from Wikipedia
(anyone know who wrote it?).

  The disjunction and existence properties are validated by
  intuitionistic logic and invalid for classical logic; they are key
  criteria used in assessing whether a logic is constructive.... The
  disjunction property is a finitary analogue, in an evident sense.
  Namely given two or finitely many propositions P_i, whose
  disjunction is true, we want to have an explicit value of the index
  i such that we have a proof of that particular P_i. There are quite
  concrete examples in number theory where this has a major effect.

It is a (meta)theorem that in free Heyting algebras and free topoi
(and all sorts of variations thereon) that the disjunction property
holds. In the free topos that translates to the statement that the
terminator, 1, is not the join of two proper subobjects. Together with
the existence property it translates to the assertion that  1  is an
indecomposable projective object -- the functor it represents (i.e.
the global-section functor) preserves epis and coproducts. (And with
a little more work one can show it also preserves co-equalizers.)

What would be an early reference for the representation of undirected
graphs (of the set-enriched rather than {0,1}-enriched kind) as
presheaves on the full subcategory 1 and 2 of Set?

I'm not sure how this affects Paul Levy's point,
but I guess that I'll let Paul speak on that.

I agree that intuitionistic logic satisfies the disjunction property.
But I don't see why this should make disjunction a more peripheral part of
intuitionistic logic than implication.

     International Workshop on Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages:
		  Theory and Practice (LFMTP'06)
     http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/lfmtp06/index.html

             Affiliated with LICS and IJCAR at FLOC'06
             Seattle, Washington, 16 August, 2006.

                     CALL FOR PAPERS

Important Dates:

Submission deadline:    15 May	2006
Author Notification:    15 June	2006
Final Version:          15 July	2006

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

LFMTP'06 merges the International workshop on Logical Frameworks
and Meta-languages (LFM) and the MERLIN workshop on MEchanized
Reasoning about Languages with variable BIndingIN).

Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for
representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of
deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their
design and implementation on one hand and their applications, for
example, to proof-carrying code have been the focus of considerable
research over the last two decades. This workshop will bring together
designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss all aspects of
logical frameworks.

The broad subject areas of LFMTP'06 are:

* The automation and implementation of the meta-theory of programming
   languages and related calculi, particularly work which involves
   variable binding and fresh name generation.
* The theoretical and practical issues concerning the encoding of
   variable binding and fresh name generation, especially the
   representation of, and reasoning about, datatypes defined from binding
   signatures.
* Case studies of meta-programming, and the mechanization of the
   (meta)theory of programming languages and calculi. Papers focusing on
   experiences with encoding programming languages theory and instances
   of proof-carrying code or proof-carrying authorization are
   particularly welcome.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

     * logical framework design
     * meta-theoretic analysis
     * applications and comparative studies
     * implementation techniques
     * efficient proof representation and validation
     * proof-generating decision procedures and theorem provers
     * proof-carrying code
     * sub-structural frameworks
     * semantic foundations
     * methods for reasoning about logics
     * case studies.

Invited Speaker: Gordon Plotkin (University of Edinburgh).

Bob Rosebrugh and I use that point of view explicitly in our book
Set for Mathematics, but it is also in my paper "Qualitative
distinctions..."graphs".  Many of the more precise papers on
combinatorics carefully describe each piece of the graph structure
without noting that  this amounts to a presentation of  the monoid
of endomaps of the 2 element set (which of course suffices).

A similar lacuna of explicitness occurs in many papers on Galois
theory where pregroupoids are an intermediate step ; the
description of  the pregroupoid concept is really just a presentation
of the monoid of endomaps of the 4-element set.  (A right action of
that monoid is a groupoid if it satisfies the evident  pullback
condition on the action of the idempotents, the associative law
being a case of the well-definedness of  higher composition.)
