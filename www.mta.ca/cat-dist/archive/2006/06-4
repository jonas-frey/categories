Let me reiterate this: There can in principle be no purely algebraic proof
of the FToA because the reals have no purely algebraic definition.
(Unless you define them as a real closed field of transcendence degree c,
but that leaves the FToA as a trivial consequence and cannot be what is
wanted.)  The proof I outlined, which someone showed me 45 years ago, uses
only the fact that R is a complete ordered field.  Given that that is the
analytic definition of R, it is impossible to avoid.  That fact is, of
course, at the heart of the fact that the circle is not contractible in a
punctured plane.

Incidentally, even constructivists (well even Errett Bishop, anyway) agree
that odd order real polynomials have a real root and that positive numbers
have square roots, since there are obvious constructions for these things.
Their real line is not complete (it is countable, but the missing numbers
are not constructible), but these roots are there anyway.

The argument I outlined is elementary, even if not especially easy.  First
you have to construct the reals, the least elementary part of the
argument.  Then comes the theorem on symmetric functions.  It is not a
deep result; it needs a careful proof, but a student can follow it without
knowing anything sophisticated.  The construction of a splitting field
(without getting into UFDs) is a bit tricky.  To adjoin a root to an
irreducible polynomial p of degree n, you start with a vector space whose
basis is called 1, u, u^2,..., u^{n-1} and define a multiplication, by
having p(u) = 0.  This is analogous to how you get from R to C.  Of
course, you use the division algorithm to show you get a field.

The theorem is algebra, but its proof isn't: any proof has to involve
some topological input (though that can be reduced to the Intermediate
Value Theorem). Vaughan seems to have a problem with the phrase
"elementary algebraic proof": of course, not all elementary proofs
are algebraic (and not all algebraic proofs are elementary), and it is
the word "algebraic" that matters here.

Incidentally, I used that Birkhoff quote in the Introduction to
"Stone Spaces" (1982). Did Mike Artin get it from me, or did he
discover it independently?

Even more incidentally, the first published proof of the Fundamental
Theorem is not by Gauss. It appears in the only mathematical paper
(in Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. volume 88, 1798) of the Reverend James
Wood, who was then a Fellow (and subsequently Master) of St John's
College, Cambridge. (His other publications were all theological
-- he was a Doctor of Divinity.) Wood's argument is essentially the
same as Gauss's second proof (1816); by modern standards, what he
writes in the paper doesn't constitute a rigorous proof, but (to
quote the late Frank Smithies) "anyone reading Wood's paper must
end up with the conviction that there is a proof somewhere there".

Eduardo quotes Mac Lane as saying
(paraphrased) If it hasn't been proved, it isn't mathematics

Much as I admire Mac Lane and owe much to him,
that's rather at odds with what most of us do
even those who insist on getting a proof ultimately.

case in point:

http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/2005-06/v18n2/04.shtml

if that isn't math, what is it?
(perjorative adjective of your choice) mathematics?

Was Newton doing *only* physics?

Even in my original posting starting this thread I acknowledged that
contractibility of the circle was not elementary:

> which was tacitly smuggled in there.   But that statement is less

I haven't at any time claimed that it was not necessary to prove this,
nor that the proof was easy.

What I have been claiming is that the result has a certain self-evident
quality to it that, it seemed to me, qualified the argument as at least
sufficiently "morally elementary" as to qualify it for inclusion in the
Britannic article on algebra.  How could the definitive encyclopedia
article on algebra not give at least a hint as to why that subject's
fundamental theorem was true?

However I've been reflecting on just what is behind the very uniform
insistence on the distinction between an algebraic proof and an analytic
one.  Since algebra is descended from analysis, it seems unkind for
algebra to deny its parentage in this way.

But I see now that this denial is logically necessary.  For consider the
algebraic plane, the least algebraically closed subfield of the complex
plane, consisting of the algebraic numbers.  The FTAlg is by definition
true there, so it ought to be provable there.  One can carry out the
same proof, and it all goes through in the same way (using circles of
growing algebraic radius, all of which are dense in their complex
completion to a connected circle) right up to the last step when we
claim that the wildly growing loop that is the image of the tamely
growing circle must eventually collide with the origin, d times in fact
for a degree d polynomial.

And indeed it does, all d times, exactly as with the complex numbers,
and with the same roots (the coefficients of the polynomial necessarily
being algebraic in this domain).

But now analysis has nothing to do with it, since these circles and
their image loops while dense are totally disconnected.  For all we know
the origin could have missed the loop by going through any of its
uncountably many gaps.  Indeed the loop has measure zero, so the chances
  of the origin colliding with it even once are less than Buckley's.

But with aim that would be the envy of any sniper the origin hit the
loop with every one of its d shots.

And how do we know this?  Using analysis.  The consensus would seem to
be that there is no other way.  Logic alone cannot help.  If that's the
case, then without analysis there is no algebraic plane.  Without the
huge continuum to support it, that tiny countable set would not exist!

It is ironic that a theorem of algebra about an algebraic domain that
itself has no element of analysis to it, being just the algebraic
closure of the rationals, a small and totally disconnected space, should
require analysis, the parent of algebra, for its proof.

The fundamental theorem of algebra is like a student calling home for
more money.  It takes a continuum to raise an algebraic number.

Jim,
Perhaps complacency is another form of preoccupation. Very often
topologists or geometers who want a functor category say things like "this
may not exist".
Of course that is slightly better than use of quotients or limits in
analysis without asking whether they exist, but in the 21st century such
waffling is unbecoming to mathematics, especially when, as I suggest, it
can be replaced by crisp algebra.
Bill

I am not sure I understand this.  Jim, do you mean to say that these
people are using some mathematical statments that are not proved?  The
article seems to me to say the opposite:  They are using numerical
calculations, which I suppose can be routinely verified as such, but
with novel applications in biology.

In fact standards of proof and rigor have undergone quite some
transformation in time, so why could they not change drastically in future?
Again lacking proper knowledge I want to ask those who know more history to
confirm or reject something I've been told. Namely, seemingly in times of
Euler and Bernoullis, to be able to prove one's statements was just a matter
of honour, but nobody was obliged to accompany announcement of a theorem
with a proof - you could keep the latter to yourself and should only present
it if somebody would challenge you by expressing doubt; which probably did
not happen that often.

So how do we know that what we consider a rigorous proof today will not be
viewed as something insufficient or even irrelevant in a couple of
centuries? For example, if mathematics would develop my way, I would give a
fact the status of being established only after seeing its validity does not
require any serious effort or expertise from an average mathematician (maybe
even a student). This would not necessarily mean waiting much more time - in
case mathematicians would continue to learn *seeing* more and more. I mean,
if you have to explain to a person in the street how to reach some place,
the amount and kind of explanation you need depends critically on whether
the person is blind or not.

For the bookworms among the readers of this FToA thread, let me
offer four older references to undergraduate-accessible expositions
of proofs along the lines already mentioned:

First, in Birkhoff & Mac Lane (my own undergraduate algebra text),
Section 3 of Chapter V of the 1953 ("revised") edition offers a
proof along winding number lines on pp. 107-109.

Next, in the 1975 MIR English edition of Kurosh's Higher Algebra
(described as the "second printing"), section 23 of Chapter 5 offers a
proof relying on the D'Alembert Lemma (on pp. 142-151).

In the same Kurosh volume, moreover, section 55 of Chapter 11 offers a
proof along symmetric function lines on pp. 337-340.

Finally, one may find the Artinian proof in the real-closed fields
section of van der Waerden's pre-WWII classic, Modern[e] Algebra.

I refrain from citing other textbooks, and I remark that numberings
(of pages, sections, chapters) may differ in other editions.

Cheers,

-- Fred

Dear Eduardo,

I promised to comment on your posting partly since you praise me in having
started this discussion but also since you touch on something very relevant
to the questions that I have been asking.
>
>In recent years J.Baez and his followers have been occupying more and more
>space in the categorical community (this fact is at the starting point of
>the present debate).

You refer to the list of meetings where John Baez has played a prominent
role as speaker in recent years -- and I forgot to mention Coimbra 1999
(School on Category Theory and Applications). I do not recall of anybody,
with the exception perhaps also of Steve Awodey, to have been given so much
attention in recent years.

I was perhaps misled by "theological considerations", namely the Templeton
Foundation and its efforts in trying to mix up science and religion. This is
unfortunately true enough, but it has nothing to do with our present
discussion. This is the conclusion that I have reached, and it is my
obligation to say so publicly.

You offer some interesting explanation for the state of affairs in category
theory meetings.

A general comment is that, whereas some of it may be true, there is much
that should be justified, or questioned. For instance, that "they have sone
interesting category theory to show", that "they bring a refreshing air",
that ours is "a community until now dominated by an old guard that has shown
no signs of necessary evolution", that our community "has not been able to
attract very good and talented mathematicians", at present there is "no
other exiting body of developments within the community".

Would you care to be more explicit? At the request of others, and to the
risk of attracting a lot of criticism, I have done so and have been grossly
misunderstood. If I did not request it, others will do so. That way, it
would be easier to respond to the above.

Let us assume for the moment that the is a rift in our category theory
community -- the "old guard" versus the "new guard". We could even put names
to represent each one -- it may seem obvious to many that, whereas Marta
Bunge "must have been influenced by Bill Lawvere (and others)", Eduardo
Dubuc "must be influenced by Andre Joyal (and others)". I am still
speculating. This imaginary discussion I want to refute, and I am sure that
you would want to do the same, or maybe not. But, is there such a rift and,
if so, why take one side against the other?

I believe that *all* progressive forces within category theory (no matter
where they come from) should join efforts rather than split over issues that
very few people understand or care about. I am a great admirer of both Bill
Lawvere and Andre Joyal (and of many others, eg Peter Freyd, Ross Street,
Ieke Moerdijk, to name a few -- of course, beginning with Grothendieck)
because, even if they may have different philosophies of mathematics (in
particular of category theory), they all bring in novel ideas derived from
great experience and insight.


>The old guard is being pushed out (prone or supine ?), but,
>alas, not by better mathematicians.

This too, is cryptic, and too sweep a generalization. I believe that there
is poor mathematics no matter which area of category theory, but there is
also good mathematics both sides of the imaginary (?)  rift. Instead of
making divisions of the sort "the young against the old", which can be used
to justify almost anything, let us make no divisions and try to preserve
excellence and promise in whatever is being done, whether applied or not,
whether fashionable or not, and filter out (as editors of journals,
organizers of conferences) the sort of mathematics that is sure to discredit
us. Who will then be the judges? Obviously good mathematicians, not biased,
completely accountable for their choices, not short-sighted, independent,
very well informed, anxious to preserve high standards. Is there anybody
left after so many requirements? Well, Peter Johnstone is one such person,
but there are several others, of course and it is not for me to make such a
list. Once identified by general consensus (here is the hard part!), let
them consistently make all the decisions (for a certain period of time, at
least). That way, it will be unlikely that the same people be invited over
and over again, and also unlikely that bad papers will be accepted to be
presented at meetings or published in our journals.

Sammy Eilenberg and Saunders MacLane may have represented different
tendencies within category theory, and most of us feel having been
influenced by one rather than by the other (some by both). Yet, there was
never any open rift between them, which was wonderful.

I decided to work on category theory after a brilliant lecture by Eilenberg
at Haverford College in (I think) 1963. I thought -- this is what I want to
do! And there (at Penn, where I was a grad student) was Peter Freyd giving a
course in Algebraic Topology, and later one in Abelian Categories.The sheer
beauty and depth of these new ideas (new then) was overwhelming, and I
decided to ask Peter to let me become his student. As I said publicly at a
recent celebration of Peter's 65th Birthday in Philadephia, this was to
determine the rest of my (I think, most interesting) life. I met Bil Lawvere
later, at a congress in Jerusalem in 1964. His new ideas were in a different
direction, but equally fascinating, and I learnt a lot from him the
following year at the Forschunsinstitut fur Matematik at the E.T.H. in
Zurich, where I also met Anders Kock, Jim Lambek, and Fritz Ulmer, among
others.  I met "the others" (Myles Tierney, Jon Beck, Jean Benabou, Saunders
MacLane, and others) at the first (1966) Oberwolfach meeting, where I was
allowed to present the results of my thesis at the very end of it. I count
as my advisors both Freyd and Lawvere (made official in the Genealogy
Project). It was the confluence of ideas and people working in harmony that
was so wonderful in those days. Why should they be gone forever?  Let us
work together to bring them back, if possible.

Something good has to come out of this discussion, or else it may have been
something worse than just a waste of time. What do you say, Eduardo?

Best wishes,
Marta

The conference is April 7 -- 11.
There have been a few minor changes of schedule.
That and other updated details may be found at:

http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/MACLANE/index.html
http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eugenia/maclane/

Since it has not yet been posted, here is a list
(still slightly tentative) of titles for the talks.

Steven Awodey
Topology and Modality

John Baez (Namboodiri Lectures)
Higher category theory, higher gauge theory

Julie Bergner
Model categories, dg categories, and derived Hall algebras

Eugenia Cheng
The periodic table of n-categories

Alissa Crans
Lie 2-groups, Lie 2-algebras, and Loop groups

Zig Fiedorowicz
n-Fold categories and n-fold loop spaces

Tom Fiore
Double categories and pseudo algebras

Peter Freyd
New structures on old categories

Nick Gurski
>From bicategories to tricategories

Peter Johnstone
Potential invertibility and presheaf toposes

Andre Joyal
The theory of quasi-categories

William Lawvere
Smooth and Simplicial Toposes

Ieke Moerdijk
Quasi-categories and quasi-operads

Peter May
Duality in bicategories and topological applications

Michael Shulman
Anchored bicategories

Danny Stevenson
Lie 2-algebras and the geometry of gerbes


As noted in the schedule, John Baez will be giving the
2006 Namboodiri Lectures at the University of Chicago in
conjunction with the conference.  This fact has also been
noted in the (interminable) crack/pot thread of postings.

Unni Namboodiri was a student of mine who was killed in a
car crash.  The lecture series was generously endowed by
his parents.  The choice of Baez as the speaker was
entirely mine, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the
subjects of those postings.  In particular, it has nothing
to do with the role of category theory in physics, the
mathematical or sociological relationship between physics
and mathematics, or the relationship between category
theory and foundations.  Rather, I like John's mathematics,
as mathematics, and I know him to be a superb speaker.
I myself don't share his interest in physics,
but I won't hold it against him.

The conference is in honor of Saunders Mac Lane, who was my
colleague and friend for over thirty-five years.  It has been
organized by Eugenia Cheng (now at the University of Chicago)
and myself.  As Saunders would have liked, there is all of a
sudden a real categorical community at Chicago. We are eager
to share our enthusiasm and describe our interests to others.
One of the things that John, Eugenia, and many of the other
speakers have in common is that they are especially good at
making category theory interesting and appealing, at sharing
their joy in the mathematics.  That is the intended spirit of
the conference.  I urge people who have not yet decided to come
to make their way to Chicago next week.  There we shall all try
to make joyful mathematics, some category theory and some not,
in celebration of the memory of Saunders Mac Lane.

Thanks, Fred, I wish I'd noticed that before.  I have the sixth printing
(1948) of the 1941 edition, which says, "Many proofs...are known; ...we
have selected one whose non-algebraic part is *especially plausible
intuitively*."  (My emphasis.)  Then they give the proof "I like".

To administer one more lash to this dead horse, the wording in the
Britannica article implies that the absence of an elementary algebraic
argument was the reason for omission of a proof of FTAlg.  Whence the
change of heart about arguments that are "especially plausible
intuitively?"  If they're good enough for an algebra text they should be
even more acceptable for an encyclopaedia article.

A consummation devoutly to be wished.  In algebraic topology, throughout
my career, there has been most of the time such harmony and a
willingness to acknowledge each ohters work.  Only briefly have there
been periods of `turf claiming' and antagonism between individuals if
not `camps'. (Of course funding was plentiful in my early days.)

	Should it not be sufficient to acknowledge good work who ever
produces it?

Hmm.  How do you propose to show there *exists* an algebraically closed
subfield of the complex numbers?  I would do it using the fundamental
theorem of algebra - the usual one, for the complex numbers.  Unless
you have some other way, I don't understand how you hope to circumvent
the use of analysis by introducing such an entity.

Indeed, the usual proof that the real numbers contains a square root
of 2 uses the completeness of the real numbers, which also counts as
"analysis".

That the rational numbers has an algebraic closure is a purely algebraic
result, with no mention of topology in either the statement or proof.

That the complex numbers is algebraically closed is not an algebraic result:
it has topology built into the statement, and also the proof(s).

That the algebraic closure of the rationals embeds in the complex
numbers has topology in the statement - and I bet also in every proof.

Higher Gauge Theory, Higher Categories
http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/namboodiri/

Abstract:

The work of Eilenberg and Mac Lane marks the beginning of a trend in
which mathematics based on sets is generalized to mathematics based on
categories and then higher categories.  We illustrate this trend towards
"categorification" by a detailed introduction to "higher gauge theory".

Gauge theory describes the parallel transport of point particles using
the formalism of connections on bundles.  In both string theory and loop
quantum gravity, point particles are replaced by 1-dimensional extended
objects: paths or loops in space.  This suggests that we seek some kind
of "higher gauge theory" that describes the parallel transport as we move
a path through space, tracing out a surface.  Surprisingly, this requires
that we "categorify" concepts from differential geometry, replacing smooth
manifolds by smooth categories, Lie groups by Lie 2-groups, Lie algebras
by Lie 2-algebras, bundles by 2-bundles, sheaves by stacks or gerbes, and
so on.  The basic tool used here is Ehresmann's notion of "internalization".

To explain how higher gauge theory fits into mathematics as a whole, we
begin with a lecture reviewing the basic principle of Galois theory and
its relation to Klein's Erlangen program, covering spaces and the fundamental
group, Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces, and Grothendieck's ideas on fibrations.

The second lecture treats connections on trivial bundles and 2-connections
on trivial 2-bundles, explaining how they can be described either in terms
of their holonomies or in terms of Lie-algebra-valued differential forms.
For a clean treatment of these concepts, we recall Chen's theory of
"smooth spaces", which generalize smooth finite-dimensional manifolds.

The third lecture explains connections on general bundles and 2-connections
on general 2-bundles, explaining how they can be described either in terms
of holonomies or local data involving differential forms.  We also explain
how 2-bundles are classified using nonabelian Cech 2-cocycles, and how the
theory of 2-connections relates to Breen and Messing's theory of "connections
on nonabelian gerbes".

Would this not be both true and false of any mathematical subject worth
its salt?  Such a subject will include deep results and/or abstract
concepts that are inaccessible even to many mathematicians, let alone
nonmathematicians.  At the same time it should be possible to trace the
chains of reasoning motivating those results and concepts back to
origins that should be easy to motivate for the nonspecialist and/or
nonmathematician.

As a case in point, category theory can be motivated by presenting it as
an approach to axiomatizing sets and functions (and more generally
algebraic structures and homomorphisms as their structure-respecting
functions, but one need not start there).  In that approach, instead of
defining a function to be a binary relation of a certain form, one
postulates functions as primitives in their own right, axiomatized by
the laws of composition and the existence of identities.

One should not feel obliged to axiomatize in full the morphisms of Set,
certainly not at the outset, and moreover not if one plans to apply the
same ideas to the morphisms of other categories at some point.  This
central tenet of category theory should be one of the factors guiding
the order of development, with associative composition foremost.

Along similar lines one can point up the parallels with how the very
words with which we speak combine associatively to form phrases and
sentences, and how addition and multiplication of both integers and
reals also obey those laws but differ in furthermore being commutative.
  It should be possible to make such an account of the
category-theoretic axiomatization of functions very accessible both to
non-mathematicians and to eighth-graders with some interest in mathematics.

One should also avoid the common jargon of the category theory
literature.  Everyday language about everyday concepts is to be
preferred to new notions that need to be defined before they can be
understood.

One could also dwell on the politics of the status quo, were it as easy
to explain ZF.  Indeed, when one compares the compositional approach
with how functions are introduced into mathematics founded on ZF, one
has to wonder how the latter came to be preferred over a framework that
axiomatizes functions as primitives.  To any save those that have long
since come to live and breathe the ZF-based definition, it is unnatural,
unmotivated, and hard to explain to nonmathematicians by comparison with
associatively composing functions.

One hypothesis for why set theory is the preferred basis today for the
concept of function is that the primitive-function approach is just too
simple to take seriously.  But that can't be true, as we saw at the
Universal Algebra and Category Theory conference at MSRI 17 years ago,
where every algebraist there understood the motivation for defining
formal languages and relation algebras abstractly as monoids, a really
simple abstraction with a rich literature of implications.  Few of them
however seemed to fully appreciate the power of applying the same
abstraction, subject to essentially the same laws, to the definition of
function, being content with the ZF picture of functions.

Or am I grossly misinterpreting what we all witnessed at that meeting?
Walt Taylor, of McKenzie, McNulty, and Taylor, "Algebras, Lattices,
Varieties: Volume I", spoke on his highly developed theory of varieties
back to back with Fred Linton's talk on monads.  It was like ships
passing in the night.  I pointed this out to George McNulty at lunch
after Fred's talk, but though we both struggled mightily and without
rancour to communicate, we just could not get to square one, in the time
available before the first afternoon talk, with the concepts of monad,
adjunction, or their relevance to what Walt had just spoken about.  And
it's not as though George and I can't communicate at all, as can be
inferred from my profuse acknowledgements of his considerable help at
both the start and end of http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/iowatr.pdf,
followed up by http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/jelia.pdf (work done
entirely in the universal algebra tradition with no mention of
categories, since that was the audience for those papers).  Except for
his being the master and I the student, George and I are very much on
the same wavelength in algebraic matters, it was only category theory
that was a closed channel between us then.  Ralph McKenzie seemed to be
more keen than Walt or George for algebraists to embrace category
theory, but even for the prime mover of tame congruence theory it seemed
to be something of an uphill battle.

It's not just monads and adjunctions that noncategorist mathematicians
have a hard time with.  In his welcoming remarks at the start of the
meeting, MSRI director and formidable geometer Bill Thurston expressed
his discomfort with Set^op, and the incredulity of half the audience was
palpable for a second.

Even today category theory labors under the dual impressions that it is
too abstract to explain to the non-specialist, yet too trivial to take
seriously.  This screwy situation is not unlike the days when oxygen was
perceived only as the absence of phlogiston, oxygen being harder to
"see" than phlogiston despite our constant immersion in it, just as we
are constantly immersed in associatively composing functions.  The
chemists of the pre-oxygen era, who believed that burning wood gave up
phlogiston to the air, would have found quite mystical the idea that the
absence of phlogiston constitutes 20% of air.  Category innocents are in
much the same boat.

Complicating matters is that this works both ways.  It is hard to
understand someone who finds it hard to understand the "obvious,"
whether true or not.   How should a categorist understand a talented
mathematician unable to process the concept of the opposite of a
concrete category?  (Useful trick: define a function to be a binary
relation and consider its converse.  Why didn't Thurston think of that?
  Why didn't someone suggest it to him?)

Marta should look forward to a time when functions are taught as
associatively composing entities as routinely as nitrogen and oxygen are
taught today as the principal constituents of air.  High school math
teachers will look back at the 21st century and marvel at how confused
people were about the nature of functions in those days.

It might of course never happen, with the concept of graph of a function
forever taken as prior to the function concept itself.  One big obstacle
is that the concept of binary relation is sufficiently well motivated in
its own right as to justify being introduced first (but in that case try
to at least get *that* defined via relation algebra, Tarski's program,
which so far has not taken hold).  Another is that there does not seem
to be any knockdown argument making composition prior to application,
and the mathematical world is currently strongly wedded to the opposite.

But the biggest obstacle is that such a sea change can't happen via an
independently written book focused on the need for that change.  Rather
the viewpoint needs to be integrated into the existing literature,
either by adapting existing texts or providing superior alternatives
whose primary purpose is to meet the extant curriculum requirements and
which accepts that getting the definitions right is only a matter of
good hygiene and not a subject in its own right to be added to an
already crowded curriculum.  It has to be an inside job.

Indeed, should we expect non-mathematicians "believe in" results like  the Jordan
curve theorem, which is very easy to see and very hard to prove? Maybe they do not
appreciate a proof of something that looks completely obvious. Or, another veryeasy
thing: If somebody walks from A to B and somebody walks fron B to A at the same
time on the same route, they will me meet somewhere, even if they don't walk with
constant speed or if they stop somewhwere. Rigorously, this is essentiaally equivalent
to the intermediate value theorem, which is not too hard to prove, but nevertheless
not trivial.

I think there are better subjects to illustrate what mathematics is about. Some months
about I was asked to contribute to a calender, in which people working in different
scientific subjects give an insight in their work and their subjects. I contributed the
party theorem that a (simple) finite graph with at n>1 vertices has two vertices of the
same dergree. The proof just uses the pidgeon-hole principle and the observation
that a vertex of degree zero and a vetex of degree n-1 cannot both exist. If course, I
avoided mathematical terminology not known to the general public and spoke of
guests of a party, where some shake hands with each other and some don't. I think
this example may give a flavour of what a proof is, but does not bother them with
formalisms which are not necessay here (but somewhere else). Of course, category
theoty usrather abstract and can hardly be explained to non-mathematians.

One remark ti the fundamental theory of algebra. From Harald Holman I learned a
proof based on a simple ideas, which can be made rigorous quite easily: Since a non-
constant complex polynomial is large outside a sufficiently large circle, its modulus
must have a (local am global) minimum inside the circle (by compactness); we can
shift it into zero (by translation) and assume the minimum is attained in zero. Since
the polynomial is not constant, it is of the form a_0+a_m*z^m+higher terms, a_m
different from 0. If a_0=0, the polynomial has a zero in 0, and we are done, so
assume that a_0 is not  0. Then there exists a complex number w with w^m=-
a_m/a_0; this follows from the polar coordinate representation, which is taught in
calculus courses. Then for sufficienly every positive real h<1, the modulus of
a_0+a_m*(hw)^m is smaller than the modulus of a_0; if we choose h small enough,
the modulus of value of the polynomial at hw is also smaller than a_0, because the
higher terms can be neglected. This contradicts our assumption that the modulus
attains a minimum in 0.

Perhaps the moral is not to bother with the Britannica.  Wikipedia has
several proofs including the winding number argument and the one I
outlined using the symmetric function argument.  Then a couple of analytic
ones.  Of course, Wiki has no size limitations.

Perhaps we have flogged this particular horse enough.

Dear Jim
Your question
"Should it not be sufficient to acknowledge good work whoever does it ? "
would I think receive the obvious answer YES from all participants in the list.

Yet it lies it the heart of most of the 200 messages, public and private, that
I have received since Marta opened the discussion. For as I concluded in III,
the problem is, How can we know ? We cannot acknowledge good work
unless we have knowledge of it. This was not a problem for 40 years, or
rather if there was temporary problem, it was usually due to the need to
acquire prerequisites, which could be done.

But in the past few years, a "new" barrier to finding out has been added
 to the mathematical culture (it was common in other parts of the
culture already); disdain for communicating, starting with disdain for
 revealing definitions. That this trend is not due to a few individual culprits
 within our community is illustrated by the attempts to justify it
 "theoretically" by  show business or business practice or by pop Oxbridge
 philosophy. Whether in exposition, in popularization, or in professional
lectures, of course the practice of noncommunication typically begins
with "'I am going to be your special  communicator about this", etc.

These additional barriers we are presented with make "How can we know"
( whether a work is good) much more difficult, and an accumulation of
such difficulties has led to a lot of concern.

Best regards
 Bill

Dear Colleagues,
   Registration for MFPS 22 is now open. The Twenty Second Conference
on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics will take
place on the campus of the University of Genoa, Italy from May 23
through May 27, 2006. In addition to six plenary addresses, there
will be three special sessions, on security, quantum computing and
timed systems, each featuring talks by invited speakers in these
areas. The remainder of the program will be composed of papers
selected by the Program Committee from those that were selected from
the submissions to the Call for Papers. Finally, there will also be a
Tutorial Day devoted by lectures on Separation Logic on May 22,
preceding the meeting. All of the details, including the list of
accepted papers, can be found at the MFPS 22 home page,
http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps22.htm There is a link there to
the Registration Page where you can also register online for the
meeting.
   Of particular importance is the short time window to reserve a
hotel room for the meeting. Blocks of rooms are being held at a
number of hotel in Genoa, but these will not be withheld from general
availability after April 20. Because of this, it is important that
you make your reservations for a hotel room as soon as possible. (I
apologize for the tardy delay in notifying you about this, but we
didn't want to announce the opening of registration until the program
was finalized.)
   As usual, if you have any questions or problems, please send email
to mfps@math.tulane.edu and we will respond.
   Best regards,
   Mike Mislove, Co-Organizer
   MFPS Conference Series

In his April 2 posting  (Reminder: Mac Lane Memorial Conference) P. May
refers to the "crack/pot thread" , and we can see his feeling about it.

In particular, he is fed-up. Many people probably share these feelings
(more or less), so I will use him as a generic symbol in this posting.

The cracks and pots debate is "(interminable)" for him. Probably it is
disturbing, and when a disturbing thing refuses to go away, May may get
angry.

He says he choose Baez as an speaker because he likes his mathematics:

What is the point ?.
Besides Motl's original reservations about Baez mathematics applied to
Physics, nobody said that "do not like Baez mathematics". Simply it was
said that it occupied much too room for what it was worth. And I said that
this was so because to-day (for a category theory meeting) there is no
other enthusiastic body of work to take predominant place.

So, what is his point ?

I myself, having to-day to organize a meeting in category theory, will
certainly invite Baez.

Related to, but not the same thing, he goes on saying:

"I myself don't share his interest in physics, but I won't hold it against
him."

What does he mean by "but I won't hold it against him." ?. Had anybody
hold the interest in physics against anyone ?

In cracks_and_pots nobody is holding or had ever hold against Baez his
interest in Physics !!

In cracks and pots it was only objected that

> The category theory community seems happy to accept uncritically, and
> give centre-stage to, any interest shown by an external field.

It is known that  ~(p ==> q)  does not mean  p  ==> ~q , as he seems
to believe
(where   p = he has interest in physics,  q = he is good,  and "~" stands
for negation).

Concerning the meeting proper:

"I urge people who have not yet decided to come
to make their way to Chicago next week.  There we shall all try
to make joyful mathematics, some category theory and some not,
in celebration of the memory of Saunders Mac Lane."

why "try" ?

I warn, "joyful" is not enough.

But, after this warning, do not take me wrong. The joyful side of
mathematics is certainly  in the spirit of Saunders, and besides, judging
by the list of speakers, it will certainly be worth while to attend. I
hope Baez will electronically publish an account of the talks, as he had
done in the past with other meetings. Everybody interested in categories
profit with Baez online.

I toast for a good meeting, the memory of Saunders Mac Lane deserves it.

I have been raised to believe that the answer to this is peer-review,
not public-trial-by-mailing-list. One problem with the latter method
is that, since nobody wants to discuss particular cases, the
discussion tends to center on generalities, innuendo and "I have heard
it repeated many times"-type arguments, and not on evidence or actual
facts that could be verified. Such evidence and facts, on the other
hand, are available to editors and referees, who are also largely
independent of public opinion. As I see it, this is exactly as it
should be.

I agree but that is not my point. I did not want to judge what is "good" or "deep"
mathematics. Of course, deep results are difficult to uderstand even for specialists,
and the existence of infinitely many primes or the party theorem are definitively not
deep. But their proofs require some amount of mathemtical thinking, which is on the
other hand still comprehensible for non mathematicians. So they can learn how
mathematics works. Then we can tell them about Fermat's Last Theorem or
applications in computerized tomography, certainly without proofs.

One point is selling mathematics to nonmathematicians, the other is selling
categories to other mathematicians (not necessarily to physicists). In general,
nonmathematicians don't even know what sets and functions are and why they are
needed in mathematics. I think that category theory makes several things clearer
(and also easier) and reveals connections and similarities between different branches
of mathematics. It is quite nice if it can also be used as a foundation, but for me this
is not the most important aspect.

Actually, I've had great difficulty with this thread [*]
because I am ~not~ conscious of this (justification of poor work).
It seems all too obvious to many of the posters here;
you are probably more familiar than I with the bulk of the literature.
But unless I've missed it, nobody has given an example of this.
(The closest is that John Baez's work has too much prominence,
but nobody wants to claim that his work is poor, quite the opposite.
And there was a work by a philosopher that was cited,
but that did not pretend to be mathematics.)

I would understand your concerns much better
if I knew a few examples, hopefully from various fields,
of poor work that has been unjustifiably accepted.
I know that it may be hard to give specific examples
without running the risk of insulting colleagues,
and I'm sorry about that; but without them,
I really don't have any idea what you're all complaining about.
(Not just Vincent, but Marta and all of the others supporting her
are included in this request, please!)

[*] Incidentally, "thread" is an old Internet term
    for a discussion resulting from a single "original post" ("OP");
    the thread consists of the OP, every post written in reply to the OP,
    everything written in reply to those posts, and so on (recursively).
    So Marta's first email on this topic is the OP,
    and the 100 or so public emails since constitute the thread.

My experience has ben quite the opposite within math
(politics is another matter)
by receiving daily list of titles and abstracts from the arXiv
I can then followup with the detials of anything that looks intersting
or suspicious to me


doesn't `everyone' use the arXiv
at least those computer connected enough to be on this list?

I have not been able to keep  up with all this correspondence, but would
like to take up Vaughan Pratt's counter to Reinhard Boerger's point saying:
`it can't be done'  which would be better as a question: `How should one do
it?'

The many books and films on maths show there is some kind of hunger to know
what this subject is about, but the books and films often avoid the subject
itself in order to emphasise the weirdness of their chief characters.

The Bangor approach has for years been `advanced mathematics from an
elementary viewpoint', and we have been trying this out on 13 year olds, and
the general public,  for the last 22 years. We have gained a lot from the
exercise, and have used the experience in talks to mathematicians, science
festivals and other scientists.

Here are some references.

136. (with T. Porter), `Category theory and higher dimensional algebra:
potential descriptive tools in neuroscience', Proceedings of the
International Conference on Theoretical Neurobiology, Delhi, February 2003,
edited by Nandini Singh, National Brain Research Centre, Conference
Proceedings 1 (2003) 80-92.

137. (with R.Paton and T. Porter), `Categorical language and hierarchical
models for cell systems', in Computation in Cells and Tissues - Perspectives
and Tools of Thought, Paton, R.; Bolouri, H.; Holcombe, M.; Parish, J.H.;
Tateson, R. (Eds.) Natural Computing Series, Springer Verlag. (2004)
289-303.

I presented the talk for 136. and it went well. One aim was to explain the
concept of colimit, as a way of putting structures together.  A scientist
from the Salk Inst said he kept on thinking about the ideas that night and
could not go to sleep!  This is a better reaction than I get generally from
algebraic topologists (pace Marta's comments)!

Here is another article:

146. (with T. Porter) `Category Theory: an abstract setting for analogy and
comparison', Advanced Studies in Mathematics and Logic (to appear) UWB Math
Preprint 05.10 .
http://www.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/public/mathematics/research/preprints/05/cathom05.html#05.10

If you examine our pages on www.popmath.org.uk, you will find discussion of
many topics, such as AIMS.

My whole approach to higher dimensional algebra since 1965 or so has been to
give expression to intuitions such as expressing a big object as a
composition of small objects, i.e. the algebraic inverse to subdivision, and
also explaining the notion of commutative cube.

There are deep ideas (e.g. knots) that can be explained to children, and so
to a general audience, and others for which  this is much more difficult.
There is a hunger among scientists and the general public to get some idea
of what is going on in mathematics, apart from solving some  famous but
weird  problems. The idea of `structure' is a good way to start, perhaps. I
have used Bill Lawvere's tag: The mathematical notion of space is for the
representation of motion, i.e. of change of data. How can space be
structured? How can we calculate and control ideas in that context? How
strange is space?

In 1987 or so,  I gave a lecture on knots to an audience from schools, and a
teacher came up to me afterwards and said: `That is the first time in my
mathematical career that anyone has used the word `analogy' in relation to
mathematics.'  Think on it!

So I have made something of a song and dance on the theme of `analogy' in
the new edition of my book: and the notion of universal property as a way of
making analogies, to obtain understanding and calculation.

Finally, to see an argument about physics and maths, see an article

S. Novikov `The Second Half of the 20th Century and its
Conclusion: Crisis in the Physics and Mathematics Community in Russia and in
the West',   published in American  Math Society Translations,  (2) vol 212,
2004

which might rise some ire among some of us. There are also important points.
It is certainly an aspect of the debate, e.g. `7. Second half of the 20th
century: excessive formalization of mathematics.'
I was sent a pdf file of this. But I do not have a url for this English
translation.

From: solovay@Math.Berkeley.EDU
Subject: [FOM]  Fraenkel-Mostowski-Specker method and category theory
To: "Foundations of Mathematics" <fom@cs.nyu.edu>

I have come across a curious question related to the FMS method and
category theory. Before stating the problem I need to recall some
definitions.

Let G be a group. A normal filter of subgroups of G, Gamma, is a non-empty
collection of subgroups of G which has the following properties:

1) If H_1 and H_2 are members of Gamma then so is their intersection H_1
\cap H_2;

2) If H is in Gamma and K is a subgroup of G which is a supergroup of H,
then K is in Gamma;

3) If H is in Gamma and x is an element of G then the conjugate subgroup
xHx^{-1} is in Gamma.

Now let G be a group and Gamma a normal filter of subgroups of G. To this
data we associate a category C(G,Gamma) as follows:

The objects of our category consist of sets X equipped with an action of H
on X [ for some H in the filter Gamma] such that for every x in X the
isotropy subgroup H_x  [consisting of those elements of H which fix the
element x] lies in Gamma.

Now let X_1 and X_2 be objects of our category carrying actions of H_1 and
H_2 respectively. The morphisms of our category from X_1 to X_2 are those
maps from X_1 to X_2 [in the category of sets] which (for some subgroup K
of H_1 \cap H_2) lying in Gamma are K-equivariant.

The basic question is: when are C(G_1, Gamma_1) and C(G_2,Gamma_2)
equivalent categories:

Here are some obvious sufficient conditions:

     (a) If there is an isomorphism of G_1 with G_2 that carries Gamma_1
onto Gamma_2 then the two categories are equivalent.

     (b) Let G be a group and Gamma a normal filter of subgroups of G. Let
H be a subgroup of G lying in Gamma, and let Gamma' be the collection
of all subgroups of H lying in Gamma. Then C(G, Gamma) and C(H,
Gamma') are equivalent.

     My question is this: Are (a) and (b) the only reasons that two such
categories are equivalent. That is, if C(G_1, Gamma_1) and C(G_2,
Gamma_2) are equivalent then are there subgroups H_1 of G_1 and H_2
of G_2 [lying in the respective filters] such that letting Gamma_1'
and Gamma_2' be the evident restricted filters we have C(H_1,
Gamma_1') equivalent to C(H_2, Gamma_2').

     I suspect that the answer is no. Also welcome [for the undisclosed
application I have in view] would be additional sufficient criteria
other than (a) and (b).

You are right. I stated my question wrongly and what I intended is your
proposed repair.

When Venet's commutative diagrams as art appeared in the AMS Notices
(vol 49 no6 2002, pp663-668) this was mystification of the
categorical approach by the artist. Good art but nothing to do with
mathematics. Since many attempts to demystify mathematics have a visual
aspect, the role of art here is interesting, as well as how artists see
this kind of activity.

One aspect of the continuing discussion seems to concern disciplinary
boundaries -- complaints that some computer scientists, physicists,
philosophers etc 'misuse' category theory or deride it. It's interesting
that efforts to explain mathematics to the general public can fall
foul of exactly similar complaints from an opposite quarter.
Often public participation projects involve art in some way and
these are indeed often funded under 'art-science' programmes.
Most such projects are valuable for engaging the
public and succeed in getting people interested, however the art is
usually of no interest to artists concerned with current issues in
contemporary art. This is not to say they are poor projects, but labelling
them as "art-science" creates the false impression there is an engagement
with art in a meaningful way.

On the other hand there is art which references mathematics, but which
has absolutely no mathematical content. For example Venet's work
and others who lift elaborate equations to great visual effect.
Yet other work (e.g. Conrad Shawcross)
involves references to physics in a quite different, but still
non-expository, way.

It seems to be an open question how art might be used to promote or
facilitate a genuine understanding of mathematics (which must
involve the reasoning processes and apreciation of abstract structure).
Perhaps Sol LeWitt (despite his writings and some critics (e.g. Rosalind
Krauss)) indicates a possible way forward. Some of his work (just like
Venet's) has nothing to do with mathematics despite the superficial
apperance; other parts are worth thinking about.

Dear All,

This is a reminder that the 83rd PSSL will take place in Glasgow one
month from now, Sat 6th and Sun 7th May.

Special attractions:

* Jon Woolf will give an introduction to derived categories.  In the
last decade or so, derived categories have become very important in
certain parts of geometry; they now seem to be a standard part of a
modern algebraic geometer's toolkit.  Jon's introduction will be
tailored to category theorists, and won't assume any specialist
knowledge.

* (an attraction for most): thanks to a brand new law, all of Scotland's
pubs, cafes, restaurants, bars, etc are now smoke-free.

For information, including the current list of participants and talks,
see

http://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~tl/pssl

There's no pressing need to register, unless (a) you want to give a
talk, or (b) you want to be in the same hotel as other participants.

Best wishes,

Tom Leinster
Richard Steiner

As an outsider, let me say something about outsiders in this. In a
word, "Where's the rosetta stone?" Here's what I mean.

I'm a numerical analyst/computer scientist. I'm ancient (much older
than 50), so I was brought up in the Dark Ages pre-computer, set-
theoretic world.

So I pick up Walters book, "Categories and computer science" and read
it. At the end, I say: OK, how do I work this into my undergraduate
classes? graduate classes? They've had discrete math in the Math
department and got no introduction to category theory. What does it
tell students about designing their current homework program? What
does this mechanism tell an undergrad about writing data structures?
What does it tell them about performance in networks? I see the point
about denotational semantics etc; I know none of our grad students
could read Walters. But if you can't retrain undergrads to switch
from what they know to a new world, it is not accepted because as
grad students they're not going to accept it either.

Now you can take a purist view and go your own way and I can go mine.
That's kinda silly. Hence, I'd settle for a rosetta stone.

Who will help me write an undergraduate text book on classic
computability concepts but from a categorical point of view? Pick
your favorite text. I suspect it would not be any help to anyone's
tenure case because it's all so obvious --- except to outsiders ---
but it would be a interesting and perhaps useful pedagogical device.
Would such a text be thinner or thicker than the original? What new
insights would we receive?

best regards,

steve

The SegraVis Research Training Network invites doctoral students and
post-doctoral researchers from both within and outside the network to
join the


               Advanced School on Visual Modelling Techniques
              Friday Afternoon 08/09/2006 - Monday 11/09/2006

OBJECTIVES
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Model-driven approaches to software development require precise
definitions for modelling languages, their syntax and semantics, their
notions of consistency and refinement, as well as their mappings into
implementations.

Modelling languages and processes, however, are subject to continuous
evolution, and different constellations and dialects are required in
different application domains, organisations, and even individual
projects. So in order to support model driven development in a variety
of contexts, we must find efficient ways of designing languages and
processes, accepting that definitions are subject to change and
extension and that tools need to be delivered in a timely fashion.

Thus, rather than ad-hoc solutions, a discipline of language engineering
is required to support the definition and implementation visual
modelling languages with respect to their

* abstract syntax and well-formedness rules
* operational and denotational semantics
* consistency and refinement relations
* model transformations

With this motivation, the objectives of this school are to provide
tutorial-like introductions to fundamental techniques supporting the
above tasks, to present examples of applications to specific languages
and problem domains, and to offer the opportunity for practical
experience in applying techniques and tools in sample projects.


LECTURE PROGRAM
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This occurred to me this morning as I was contemplating the differences
between the formalist, algebraic, and categorial schools of mathematical
reasoning for an encyclopaedia article.  Whereas Boolean logic is
certainly the logic of sets, Aristotelian logic, especially the
syllogisms Barbara and Celarent, would seem to be more that of
*-autonomous categories.


LOGICIANS AS PEACENIKS: The Early Days

Alexander lived a hearty life of dames and kings,
While his tutor Aristotle nattered on of names and things.
But while Alexander's military followed him to wars,
Aristotle's syllogisms followed from his laws.

Darius and Alexander fought a mighty war.
The likes of such an argument had not been seen before.
But by Barbara and Celarent did Aristotle swear
As the mistresses of argument that never hurt a hair.

This summer several workshops will take place July 17-23 (2006) at Oxford
University:

        * NEW MODELS OF QUANTUM INFORMATICS

        * AXIOMATICS FOR QUANTUM MECHANICS

        * TENSORS KNOTS AND BRAIDS IN LOGIC AND PHYSICS

        * QUANTUM PROGRAMING LANGUAGES (QPL IV)

The whole event will take place under the name ``CATS, KETS and
CLOISTERS'':

        * http://se10.comlab.ox.ac.uk:8080/FOCS/CKCinOXFORD_en.html

[SURVEYS/TUTORIALS:] Each workshop will include tutorial and/or survey
talks.  Preliminary informal contacts concerning have confirmed several
people willing to provide these survey/tutorial lectures, including Samson
Abramsky (Oxford), Richard Jozsa (Bristol) and Sam Lomonaco Jr (UMBC),
among others.  Topics under consideration include: measurement-based
quantum computation, topological quantum computation, simulations of
quantum computations, knots and braids in logic, quantum geometry and
topology, categorical algebra for quantum mechanics, and semantics for
quantum computing.

[CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS:] The call for QPL IV is available at:

        * http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/qpl2006/

We invite you to propose contributions for the three other workshops,
either by submitting a short description, short abstract, extended
abstract or full paper.  These contributions will then be considered by
the Program Committee:

              Jens Eisert (Imperial College, UK)
              Richard Jozsa (University of Bristol, UK)
              Samuel Lomonaco Jr. (UMBC, Maryland, US)
              Prakash Panangaden (McGill University, CA)
              Phil Scott (University of Ottawa, CA)
              Samson Abramsky (University of Oxford, UK)
              Bob Coecke (University of Oxford, UK)

Relevant proposals for surveys/tutorials are also still welcome.
Preference will be given to talks which are accessible beyond the
boundaries of the distinct workshops.  The three workshops should indeed
be conceived as ``themes'' within a bigger event.  Slots will be allocated
to speakers to some extend on a first-come-first-serve base, subject to a
quality check and ``sufficiently broad relevance'' check by the PC.
Please send your contributions to:

        * bob.coecke@comlab.ox.ac.uk

[POSTER SESSION:] Students and other young researchers in particular are
encouraged to propose posters, which will be displayed in the workshop
area throughout the whole event, and to which a session will be dedicated.

[PRACTICALITIES:] The local organizing committee consists of:

              Samson Abramsky (Computing)
              Dan Browne (Physics)
              Bob Coecke (Computing)
              Hilary Priestley (Mathematics)

Oxford is a pleasant place to visit during the summer, with many things to
see (including London, only an hour by train), and a wealth of tourist
attractions and beautiful country-side conveniently accessible.

        * http://www.oxfordcity.co.uk/

Oxford has a wide variety of places to stay, including both junior and
senior College Accomodation, Hotels, Hostels, and Bed and Breakfasts
(B&Bs) and Guest Houses. We would in particular recommend the B&Bs and
Guest Houses since they tend to be much cheaper than hotels, and the
British breakfast keeps you going for the whole day. For detailed
information concerning accommodation in Oxford please consult:

        * http://se10.comlab.ox.ac.uk:8080/FOCS/Where_to_stay_en.html

>From my experience, "Conceptual Mathematics" by Lawvere and Schanuel
can serve as a Rosetta stone for undergraduate students interested
in dynamic systems. I had the opportunity to use "Conceptual
Mathematics" as a reference in an upper-level applied math class
at the University of Dallas. Sample course materials are available at:
http://www.adjoint-functors.net/teaching/notes1.pdf
http://www.adjoint-functors.net/teaching/exam1.pdf
http://www.adjoint-functors.net/teaching/quiz3.pdf
http://www.adjoint-functors.net/teaching/lifeS.pdf
Lawvere's definitions of symbolic dynamics and chaos were of
particular interest to the students and to me.

I found that categorical ideas also provided useful exercises
and organization into an analysis course I taught using Rudin's
"Principles of Mathematical Analysis". The following notes
provide examples: page 8 of
http://www.adjoint-functors.net/teaching/rudin1.pdf
pages 1--7 and 11 of
http://www.adjoint-functors.net/teaching/rudin2.pdf
pages 2--6, 8, 10--12, and 16 of
http://www.adjoint-functors.net/teaching/rudin4.pdf
There are many other opportunities to introduce categorical notions
throughout the course perhaps using material from "Sets for Mathematics"
by Lawvere and Rosebrugh.

As a graduate student, I found that "Conceptual Mathematics" clarified
concepts from dynamic systems theory and provided insights into Lawvere's
categorical dynamics program and into the core literature on dynamic
systems. See http://www.adjoint-functors.net/aipcasys2.pdf and the
references cited.

For applications to computer science, recent papers by Katis, Rosebrugh,
and Walters have applications to concurrency; provide categorical
definitions of transition systems, bisimulation, and related concepts; and
clarify the treatment of those topics in the books by Arnold and by
Clarke, et al. Although not in textbook form, some of these articles are
accessible to undergraduates. Model-checking and automatic software
verification researches get considerable financial support=20 from U.S.
government sponsors (see http://www.sba.gov/SBIR).

Another Rosetta stone for students interested in computer science
is the literature on sketch-based data models. Papers by Johnson,
Piessens, Rosebrugh, Steegmans, and others are accessible to advanced
undergraduates with faculty guidance. Interoperability of information systems
is also a focus area of the sponsors mentioned above.

In a previous e-mail, Peter Selinger suggested that "[categorical
research with applications to physics] is supported because it is
original, timely, and interesting". Since taking a non-academic
position, I have found that the novelty of category-based proposals
does get the attention of sponsors looking for new ideas (although
I have not submitted any proposals for physics research). In seeking
applications of categories to new areas, we are fortunate to already
have a theory of such great depth. How would thermodynamics be
taught now if Truesdell had been born 100 years earlier?

I will be eager to purchase an undergraduate text on computability
concepts from a categorical perspective. A few years ago I spent
time trying to learn this material from Soare's text without much
success.

BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE
=========================

Computer security is an established field of computer science of both
theoretical and practical significance. In recent years, there has been
increasing interest in logic-based foundations for various methods in
computer security, including the formal specification, analysis and
design of security protocols and their applications, the formal
definition of various aspects of security such as access control
mechanisms, mobile code security and denial-of-service attacks, and the
modeling of information flow and its application to confidentiality
policies, system composition, and covert channel analysis.

The workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is the fusion of two workshops. The workshop
FCS continues a tradition, initiated with the Workshops on Formal
Methods and Security Protocols (FMSP) in 1998 and 1999, then with the
Workshop on Formal Methods and Computer Security (FMCS) in 2000, and
finally with the LICS satellite Workshop on Foundations of Computer
Security (FCS) in 2002 through 2005, of bringing together formal methods
and the security community.

The ARSPA workshop is the third in a series of workshops on Automated
Reasoning for Security Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers
and practitioners from both the security and the formal methods
communities, from academia and industry, who are working on developing
and applying automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal
specification and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA
workshops were held as satellite events of IJCAR'04 and of ICALP'05,
respectively.

The aim of the joint workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is to provide a forum for
continued activity in these areas, to bring computer security
researchers in closer contact with the LICS community, and to give LICS
attendees an opportunity to talk to experts in computer security. We
thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work and on work in
progress.

We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques
and tools for the formal specification and analysis of security
protocols.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

Automated reasoning techniques       Access control and resource usage control
Composition issues                   Authentication
Formal specification                 Availability and denial of service
Foundations of verification          Covert channels
Information flow analysis            Confidentiality
Language-based security              Integrity and privacy
Logic-based design              for  Intrusion detection
Program transformation               Malicious code
Security models                      Mobile code
Static analysis                      Mutual distrust
Statistical methods                  Privacy
Tools                                Security policies
Trust management                     Security protocols

All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.

After this date, we will do what we can, but Kuressaare is a small =

town and July is in the peak season.


Venue

Kuressaare (pop. 16000) is the main town on Saaremaa (=D6sel), the
second-largest island of the Baltic Sea. Kuressaare is a charming
seaside resort on the shores of the Gulf of Riga highly popular with
Estonians as well as visitors to Estonia.

The scientific sessions of MPC/AMAST 2006 will take place at Saaremaa
Spa Hotel Meri, one among the several new spa hotels in the town. The
social events will involve a number of sites, including the
14th-century episcopal castle and the impact craters of
Kaali. Accommodation will be at Saaremaa Spa Hotels Meri and R=FC=FCtli.

To get to Kuressaare, one normally passes through Tallinn
(pop. 402000), Estonia's capital city. Tallinn is famous for its
picturesque medieval Old Town, inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage
List.

=46rom Tallinn, Kuressaare is easily reached by scheduled coach
(incl. a ferry ride). We may arrange chartered coaches from Tallinn to
Kuressaare and back both for MPC and AMAST, but this depends on the
demand.

There are also twice-daily flights to Kuressaare from Tallinn and
twice-weekly direct flights from Helsinki and Stockholm.


Local organizers

MPC/AMAST 2006 is organized by Institute of Cybernetics, a research
institute of Tallinn University of Technology.

HEADLINE: Scales Fall Short Of Grand Symphonies In Maths

BYLINE: Marcus du Sautoy

BODY:

Pique children's interest in maths with elegant epics, enigmatic mysteries
and cold hard cash, says Marcus du Sautoy.

World pi Day was marked at 1:59 on March 14 - 3.14159 being the beginning
of the decimal expansion of pi. Although I am appreciative of any
publicity mathematics can get, I found that most people were interested in
how many decimal places I knew of this important number. They were
disappointed that five was my limit. To me, that response revealed the
deep misconception people have of what mathematics is really about.

Most people's idea of what I do as a research mathematician is long
division to lots of decimal places. But fundamentally, mathematics isn't
about numbers - it's about finding structure and logic and connections
that help us negotiate the complex world we live in.

The belief that mathematics is no more than long division is fuelled by
the way most pupils are taught the subject at school. Imagine a student
learning a musical instrument by playing only scales and arpeggios and
never even hearing a symphony. No one would judge them for giving up. Yet
all too often in pupils' mathematical education, this is all they are
exposed to.

Pupils I talk to are surprised to learn that there are complex
mathematical equations controlling the evolution of their PlayStation
games or that the sine waves that they learn about in trigonometry are the
building blocks used by their MP3 players to recreate the sound of the
Arctic Monkeys in their headphones.

Practical applications are a powerful way to awaken people to the
importance of the subject. But beauty and elegance can also attract many
to the subject. It is the great stories of mathematics, many of them
unfinished, that I believe have the potential to capture pupils'
imaginations when they doubt the value of mathematics. Therefore, it is
the responsibility of those who create these stories, the research
mathematicians, to bring the subject alive. There is no escaping the hard
graft of doing your arithmetic scales and arpeggios.  But if these are set
in the context of the big mathematical symphonies they help write,
students may feel more inclined to apply themselves.

The story of the primes is one of the sagas that I have found can pull
young people on to the mathematical bandwagon. They are the building
blocks of all numbers. And as you play with them, they very soon draw you
into one of our biggest mathematical mystery stories.

The great challenge is to understand how nature chose these enigmatic
numbers. The search for a pattern behind the primes goes to the heart of
what it means for me to be a mathematician. Yet intriguingly, our subject
seems to be built out of numbers with no patterns to them at all.

The biggest prime we know has more than 9 million digits - a number that
would take more than a month and a half to read aloud. But bigger primes
will always be discovered - there is a prize of $100,000 (Pounds 57,000)
waiting for the first person to break the 10 million digit mark. The
records to date are not held by boffins with big computers but amateurs
with desktops.

Money is a great incentive for getting kids' eyes to light up. And one can
use it to introduce the deeper meaning behind the headline. Once they have
won $100,000, then they can move on to the million-dollar prize of finding
the underlying structure that makes these numbers tick, which involves
solving the Riemann hypothesis.

The National Centre for Excellence in Teaching Mathematics, to be launched
in May, has the potential to communicate some of the big stories of
mathematics to teachers who can, in turn, spread the word in our schools
and colleges.  But it is important for those at universities to play their
part in keeping alive the narrative tradition. In our conferences and
journals, we are all engaged in telling the tales of our mathematical
adventures. If we want more young explorers to join us on the hard treks
across the mathematical mountains, then research mathematicians have a
part to play in telling those outside the ivory towers our best stories.

Scientific research consists of two important components: discovery and
communication. Without one, the other will die. Oswald Veblen, in his
opening address to the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1952,
expressed well this need to perform our theorems: "Mathematics is terribly
individual. Any mathematical act, whether of creation or apprehension,
takes place in the deepest recesses of the individual mind. Mathematical
thoughts must nevertheless be communicated to other individuals and
assimilated into the body of general knowledge. Otherwise they can hardly
be said to exist."

   Marcus du Sautoy is professor of mathematics at Oxford University and author
   of The Music of the Primes, published by Harper Perennial, Pounds 8.99. This
   article is based on his inaugural Drapers lecture on teaching and learning at
   Queen Mary, University of London.

	GAMES FOR LOGIC AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 2006
	GALOP II -- A FLOC 2006 WORKSHOP
	http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/galop
	Seattle, Washington, USA,
	August 10 - 22, 2006
	CALL FOR PAPERS

TOPIC

Game semantics has emerged as a successful paradigm in the field of =20
semantics of logics and programming languages. Game-semantic =20
techniques led to the development of the first syntax-independent =20
fully-abstract models for a variety of programming languages, ranging =20=

from the purely functional to languages with imperative features such =20=

as control, references or concurrency.  There are also connections =20
between game semantics and other semantic theories, including the the =20=

pi-calculus and domain theory. In addition to semantic analysis, an =20
algorithmic approach to game semantics has recently been developed, =20
with a view to applications in computer assisted verification and =20
program analysis.

SUBMISSIONS

* Submission: May 19
* Notification: June 9

This is intended to be an informal workshop. Participants are =20
encouraged to present work in progress, overviews of more extensive =20
work, and programmatic/position papers, as well as completed =20
projects. We therefore ask for submission both of short abstracts =20
outlining what will be presented at the workshop and of longer papers =20=

describing completed work, either published or unpublished, in the =20
following areas:

	* Game theory and interaction models in semantics
	* Games-based design and verification
	* Logics for games and games for logics
	* Algorithmic aspects of games

To submit please follow the EasyChair link http://www.easychair.org/=20
GALOP2/.

A special journal issue associated with the workshop is being =20
considered; this will be discussed at the workshop.

Challenge would appear to be a key ingredient here.  To continue the
recent thread on bringing categories to the masses, is there a short
list of such sagas whose challenges big and small might pull young
people on to the category theory bandwagon?  Abelian categories?
Toposes?  Monads?  Synthetic differential geometry?  n-categories?

All would seem to be fairly easily accessed from very accessible parts
of respectively topology (coffee cups, Betti numbers), constructive
logic (Brouwer vs. Hilbert, proofs as programs), number systems (Galois
and unsolvability by radicals), analysis (infinitesimals according to
Cauchy, Weierstrass, Robinson, Kock), and cosmology (the organization of
strings).

What other challenges, big and small, met and unmet, might young people
find a compelling lead-in to categorical thinking?

In all these areas, bringing the novice to the mathematics is surely a
less promising strategy than bringing the mathematics to the novice.  If
home delivery can radicalize the pizza business, why can't it do the
same for category theory?

"Most people's idea of what I do as a research mathematician is long
division to lots of decimal places. But fundamentally, mathematics isn't

Yes, but do not despise long division  !!

Certainly, mathematics is about "finding structure and logic and
connections", but it is also about numbers and particulary about "long
division to lots of decimal places".

I belive that those who did not found any pleasure in developing the
ability to perform long division to a lot of decimal places when they were
kids, will never find and/or develop mathematically meaningful "structure
and logic and connections".

I belive that good mathematicians are able to perform complicated
calculations, and find pleasure on it, even if it is not what they
currently do.

"Numbers, algorithms and calculations" as well as "structure, connections
and logic", are at the core of mathematics. Ah !, and do not forget
"proofs".

e.d.

I have given introductory courses in Category Theory (including Monads),
Toposes, Locales, Synthetic Differential Geometry in Mexico (UNAM), Spain
(University of the Balearic Islands, Spain), and Egypt (Cairo University).
The background material can be incorporated intro the lectures as needed.

Dear Colleagues,
   This is a reminder that the deadline for making hotel reservations
for MFPS 22 at the conference rate is this Thursday, April 20. The
meeting will take place from Wednesday, May 24 through midday
Saturday, May 27 at the University of Genoa, Italy, with a Tutorial
Day on Separation Logic preceding it on May 23. Information about the
invited speakers, the special session speakers and the accepted
papers is available at the MFPS 22 web site, http://
www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps22.htm where there is a link to the
Registration Page and information about hotel reservations. There is
also a link to the University of Genoa page for MFPS 22 which
includes some information about the local scene. The URL for that
page is http://mfpsxxii.disi.unige.it/
   One further note: we are only able to accept credit card payments
for the registration fee for the meeting, so participants will have
to register online, and then call us with their credit card
information. This will be possible even after this week, but if you
are planning on attending, it is helpful if you register now, since
that aids in our planning for the meeting.
   Best regards,
   Mike Mislove

Dear Marta,

I couldn't agree more.  Usually I find myself disagreeing with some
picky point or other but somehow your message managed to completely
avoid my (too many) hot buttons!

Your two points (broad publicity for the general benefits of the subject
but only taking the best students to actually work in it) are of course
applicable to any subject.   Executing well on both brings a new subject
up to the stature of the established subjects.  CT has done very well on
the latter but might be judged as having fallen short on the former so
far, though perhaps not for want of trying but rather the manner of
presentation.  When in Rome speak Italian (and don't mention home
delivery pizza).

On the concern you raised a while back about perceptions of crankiness,
physics runs the gamut from well-publicized spectacular advances to more
cranks than just about any other scientific discipline; in that respect
it nicely brackets both CT and chemistry on both sides.  Whether CT has
accumulated more cranks than chemists is an interesting question, which
brings to mind the category theory professors from the Mahareshi Yogi's
TM university in Fairfield buttonholing Bill Lawvere at an AMAST meeting
in Iowa a while back.  Wish I could have video'd that.

Best,
Vaughan

Dear Vaughan,

I meant to write a more substantial reply to your question, but I was
interrupted by an important  telephone call and accidentally I sent a
partial reply.

I meant to say that there are many attractive results in classical
mathematics than can be shown to advantage using category theory, and that
I found that emphasizing those in my courses (which of course I have given
also repeatedly here at McGill, not just in Spain, Mexico and Egypt) is
the key to interest students who do not even intend to work in categories.
After all, we want to educate future analysts, topologists, algebraists,
computer scientists, logicians to feel that knowing a bit of categories
can help in their fields. To me, this is the goal in teaching categories.
I only take (or have taken so far) students with a broad mathematical
culture and who can get motivated to do categories with a view to better
understand and relate different mathematical fields. This is how
Gorthendieck pursued mathematics and of course, as it must happen, often
going off tangent to develop a theory suggested by obstructions in
ordinary work. I feel happier when that happens and do not necessarily
think that one ought to aim at forming (often poor) students in category
theory. Only the very best, if they can be lured to do so, should work in
category theory. Of course, I would myself have been eliminated at the
onset had my "rules" been applied in those days. But in the 60's it was
different and I now see that catgegory theory must come after the
"mathematical experience", not before.

I can take the time some time this summer to make a list of such
attractive results in the fields I know within category theory. I am too
busy now.

Best wishes,
Marta

Of course, by "mathematical experience" one need not assume that it should
be the same for everybody. MacLane was thinking of the pure mathematicians
only, because that was what motivated him all along.

I think that "Conceptual Mathematics" by Lawvere and Schanuel, though
seemingly too elementary, is a great introduction to categorical thinking
that can be widely appreciated, since the examples chosen therein to
illustrate new concepts are simple. I say this in more detail in a review
(in Spanish) that can be found in my home page
(http://www.math.mcgill.ca/bunge/LS.pdf (.ps)). Even so, you must agree that
computer scientists ought to have learnt a certain amount of pure
mathematics, or else how are they going to appreciate the more sophisticated
developments in their field, or even less contribute to it?

I used "Categories and Computer Science" by Bob Walters twice when teaching
"Computability and Linguistics" at McGill. Although I have heard some
negative comments about it (sorry to mention it, Bob), I liked it a lot. The
exercises are often quite demanding, and the exposition clear. I do not know
what you think about it. Of course, with a book like that, as with any
other, it is up to the instructor to use it to his advantage, and to
complement it as needed by the particular audience he has to face.

Nice hearing from you,
Marta

Dear Marta,

I think this is exactly the key to the success of Mac Lane's book.
Throughout, he shows how working mathematicians are applying category
theory already without realizing it. One of the basic expositional
problems for teaching CT in computer science is that our students do
not have the body of mathematical experience that Mac Lane presumed.

Regards,

Steve.

The thread I unintentionally initiated (with mixed results) did not express
any concern about cranks, but about crackpots, whom I view as dangerous only
if not spotted in time.

I think that "cranks" means "eccentric" and, in it itself, it means nothing
to me -- crankiness (if that is the correct adjective) can be: (a) the
result of genuine absent-mindedness and total commitment to their activities
as mathematicians/scientists, or (b) it can also be a pose by an insecure
person who may have nothing else but his crankiness to be distinguished from
the others. Some fields (like Physics) have both. Chemists are too serious
(boring) to tolerate any cranks in their midst. CT? Yes, there are a few,
but in my view, that is the least of our worries. Maybe by "crank" you meant
something else ("crackpots"?), as the incident you recall (first time I hear
about it) seems to indicate. In any case, the last thing anybody wants right
now is to go back to discuss this sensitive issue.

Best,
Marta

Dear category theorists,

let C be a monoidal category and S(C) the same category but regarded
as a bicatgeory with a single object.

Unless I am confused, a lax functor into S(C) is a lot like a
sub-bicategory of the bicategory of bimodules internal to C.

Identity morphisms a--Id-->a are sent by the lax functor to algebras
A_a internal to C and morphisms  a--->b to A_a-A_b bimodules.
Composite morphisms a-->b-->c are sent to bimodule products over A_b.

This, and in particular its precise formulation, must be well known.
But I could not locate a reference for it.

If anyone could provide any comments or point me to some literature,
I'd be very grateful.

P.S.

This should play a role in defining the notion of background
configurations is rational conformal field theory:

ah, linguistic problems not sure about British/Canadian English but in
American cranks ae slightly worse than crackpots and not at all the same
as being cranky

I don't think that this is the problem. There are quite a few areas in CS
(mainly semantics) where it is even impossible to formulate the problem
when not having the language of CT available. Paradigmatic example being
solution of recursive domain equations. In my regular course on semantics
I introduce category theory by need and some of those people then attend
my course on category theory and categorical logic (all available on my
home page if you want to look). One certainly need not know a lot about
algebra of geometry for these purposes.  The problem rather is that most
students of CS are not open to any theory whatsoever be it categorical or
not.

BTW another example are socalled "effects" (i.e. something fairly applied
and "impure" if you want). For modelling them appropriately one needs
either monads or cpo-enriched Lawvere theories.

Maybe what you deplore is the absence of SIMPLE examples from CS. Well, I
think one can use posets, graphs, monoids, abelian groups, fields etc.
What's more problematic is the usual ignorance of simple topological
examples. Maybe a bit of analysis (done properly) would do them good?

                        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

    18TH EUROPEAN SUMMER SCHOOL OF LOGIC, LANGUAGE AND INFORMATION
                      July 31 - August 11, 2006
                            Malaga, Spain

              (Extended Early registration deadline: May 14, 2006)

ESSLLI 2006 is organized by the Software Engineering Group of the University
of Malaga, under the auspices of FoLLI, the European Association for Logic,
Language and Information.

The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics, logic and
computation. The school has developed into an important meeting place and
forum for discussion for students, researchers and IT professionals
interested in the interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and
Information.

The 18th edition of ESSLLI is offering 48 courses, organized into three
interdisciplinary areas (Language & Computation, Language & Logic, and Logic
& Computation), at a variety of levels (foundational, introductory,
advanced), as well as seven workshops.

All the information may be found at:

http://esslli2006.lcc.uma.es

Foundational courses aim to provide truly introductory courses into a field.
The courses presuppose absolutely no background knowledge. In particular,
they should be accessible to people from other disciplines. Introductory
courses are intended to equip students and young researchers with a good
understanding of a field's basic methods and techniques, and to allow
experienced researchers from other fields to acquire the key competences of
neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly
interdisciplinary research community. Advanced courses are intended to
enable participants to acquire more specialized knowledge about topics they
are already familiar with. Workshops are intended to encourage collaboration

and the cross-fertilization of ideas by stimulating in-depth discussion of
issues which are at the forefront of current research in the field. In these
workshops, students and researchers can give presentations of their
research.

In addition to courses and workshops a student session is being also
organized, with the aim of providing Masters and PhD students with an
opportunity to present their own work to a professional audience, thereby
getting informed feedback on their own results. Unlike workshops, the
student session is not tied to any specific theme.

If you are interested in presenting a paper to any of the ESSLLI workshops,
you can access to their call for papers through the following link
http://esslli2006.lcc.uma.es.

The early (extended) registration deadline is May 14, 2006.

Second Call for Papers:

         Structural Operational Semantics 2006

         A Satellite Workshop of CONCUR 2006

         August 26, 2006, Bonn, Germany

         http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~rvg/SOS2006

Aim: Structural operational semantics (SOS) provides a framework
for giving operational semantics to programming and specification
languages. A growing number of programming languages from
commercial and academic spheres have been given usable semantic
descriptions by means of structural operational semantics. Because
of its intuitive appeal and flexibility, structural operational
semantics has found considerable application in the study of the
semantics of concurrent processes. Moreover, it is becoming a
viable alternative to denotational semantics in the static analysis
of programs, and in proving compiler correctness.

Recently, structural operational semantics has been successfully
applied as a formal tool to establish results that hold for classes
of process description languages. This has allowed for the
generalisation of well-known results in the field of process
algebra, and for the development of a meta-theory for process
calculi based on the realization that many of the results in this
field only depend upon general semantic properties of language
constructs.

This workshop aims at being a forum for researchers, students and
practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for
future investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics.
One of the specific goals of the workshop is to establish synergies
between the concurrency and programming language communities working
on the theory and practice of SOS. Moreover, it aims at widening the
knowledge of SOS among postgraduate students and young researchers
worldwide.

Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

  * programming languages
  * process algebras
  * higher-order formalisms
  * rule formats for operational specifications
  * meaning of operational specifications
  * comparisons between denotational, axiomatic and SOS
  * compositionality of modal logics with respect to
    operational specifications
  * congruence with respect to behavioural equivalences
  * conservative extensions
  * derivation of proof rules from operational specifications
  * software tools that automate, or are based on, SOS.

Papers reporting on applications of SOS to software engineering and
other areas of computer science are welcome.

History: The first SOS Workshop took place in August 2004 in London
as one of the satellite workshops of CONCUR 2004, and was attended
by over 30 participants [http://www.cs.aau.dk/~luca/SOS-WORKSHOP/].
The second SOS Workshop occurred in July 2005 in Lisbon as a
satellite workshop of ICALP 2005, and attracted 19 submissions
[http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/SOS2005/].


INVITED SPEAKERS:

  * Robin Milner (Cambridge, UK; joint invited speaker with EXPRESS 2006)

  * Bartek Klin (Sussex, UK)

Does duality categorify?  If so, how?  If not, why not?

For example distributive lattices categorify to distributive algebras.
The dual of a distributive lattice is a partially ordered Stone space.
What does categorification do here?

(Apologies if this is an old chestnut.)

Since a couple of you have been asking about this, I thought
I should post a quick followup message.

I had several private replies, almost all of them asking to see
the proof. None of my respondents knew of an existing proof.

A preliminary paper, describing the proof, in far more detail
than most of the people on this list would need, is available
from

  http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0604542

(If any of you have any comments on it, I'd be interested in hearing
them.)

Vaughn Pratt asks:

> Does duality categorify?  If so, how?  If not, why not?

Of course this is a huge question, but the answer is:
surely it must!

My own favorite duality is between compact Hausdorff spaces
and commutative C*-algebras, because my advisor was Irving
Segal.  Elements of such a C*-algebra can be thought of as
continuous functions on its "spectrum", which is a compact
Hausdorff space.  This map from the algebra to function on
its spectrum is called the "Gelfand transform"; you can think
of the Fourier transform as a special case.

If you categorify this you get something called the
Doplicher-Robert theorem, which is a duality between certain
"compact groupoids" and certain "symmetric monoidal C*-categories".
I tried to explain this here:

http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/q-alg/9609018

However, if I really wanted to categorify dualities in general,
I'd start with less complicated examples.

> For example distributive lattices categorify to distributive algebras.
> The dual of a distributive lattice is a partially ordered Stone space.
> What does categorification do here?

Unfortunately I don't know what a distributive algebra is
or in what sense it's a categorified distributive lattice.

If I had to think about this, I'd probably start with something
I understand ever so slightly better, like the duality between
finite posets and finite distributive lattices.

Best,
jb

PS - there's some nice feedback on our questions about the
algebraic closure of the rationals here:

http://groups.google.com/group/sci.math.research/browse_thread/thread/61e30c22ee6c27b6/f647aee0763a349c?&hl=en#f647aee0763a349c

Briefly, while the existence of an algebraic closure of Q
can be shown without choice, it uniqueness-up-to-isomorphism
seems to require choice.  Also, while arithmetic operations
in Qbar are computable, they seem to present interesting challenges.
Quoting David Madore:

 The usual manner is to represent a real element of Qbar by

 * its minimal polynomial over Q (or perhaps, some polynomial, not
 necessarily minimal, but probably at least separable, of which it is a
 root),

 * an interval which isolates the root from all other roots (or the
 number of the root in the usual order on the reals).

 Basically the trick is that sums and products can be computed by
 universal rules (if P1 and P2 are polynomials over Q, there is a
 polynomial, which can be given universally in function of the
 coefficients of P1 and P2, whose roots are the sums of roots of P1 and
 P2, and ditto for the product), and roots can always be isolated using
 Sturm-Liouville (in other words, you can narrow the interval as much
 as you want since Sturm-Liouville lets you count the number of roots
 in any given interval).

 This is for real algebraics; for the full Qbar, you just represent a
 complex number by its real and imaginary parts (both of which are
 algebraic if the complex is algebraic).

 Actually programming this is *unbelievably* painful.  As for the
 algorithmic complexity, I think it's not that bad, in the sense that
 if x and y have small height (for any reasonable definition of
 "height") then computing x+y can be done in a reasonable time, but
 there's a catch: the height of x+y grows considerably larger than that
 of x or y, so any actual computation can become terribly difficult.
 (The same problem happens for rationals: computing r+s where r and s
 are rationals is polynomial in the height of r and s, but try
 computing something like 1/2+1/3+1/5+1/7+1/11+1/13+1/17...)

Dear all,

after a bit of searching, I cannot find much in the literature about gr-
stacks, more specifically, charts and presentations thereof reflecting (in a
non-technical sense) the group-like structure. Also, aside from self
equivalences of gerbes and quotients of groups (G/H for non-normal H), I
cannot dream up other "interesting" examples - and these are the opposite ends
of the spectrum I want to consider.

All pointers welcome.

Another example would be stack associated to the presheaf of
groupoids defined by a crossed module d: G --> H. You end up with
the stack of G-torsors equipped with a trivialization of the
associated H-torsor via the homomorphism d. But because you have
a crossed module, the trivialization can be used to induce a
G-bitorsor structure compatible with the section giving the
trivialization above. The bitorsor product will give the gr-stack
structure.

This is spelled out in some detail in L. Breen's "Bitorseurs et
cohomologie non ab\'elienne," in The Grothendieck Festschrift,
Vol. I.

Also, Aut(x) for x an object in a 2-gerbe gives an example.

Hope this helps a bit,

On the subject of favorite dualities:

Surely the most important are the self-dualities and the most
important of these (so important we stop noticing it as we age) is the
category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a given field.

Next is Pontryagin's: the category of locally compact groups.  The
original Pontryagin duality easily generalizes: the category of
locally compact modules over a given commutative ring is self-dual.
(In the non-commutative case one also obtains a duality but not a
self-duality -- unless, of course, the ring is self-dual.) A corollary
is that the category of discrete left  R-modules is dual to the
category of compact right  R-modules. (For 50 years I've been trying to
turn this into an exercise in abelian categories. There's a nice
reduction down to the proposition that  R/Z  is a cogenerator for the
category of compact abelian groups, but that fact seems to require
some non-trivial functional analysis.) Strange that two of the most
important "dualities" are both Pontryagin's. The other is in algebraic
topology theory.

Then, of course there's my present favorite: the category of finitely
presented group-valued functors from the category of finitely
presented modules over a commutative ring.

Sorry, I meant to write distributive category, a la Chapter 3 of Bob
Walters' book "Categories and Computer Science".  (I just finished
writing an article on algebra, I seem to have algebras on the brain.)

Right, that was the example I had in mind.
Distributive lattices:posets :: distributive categories:?

As an initial guess: "categories", with dualizer Set, which is both a
category and a distributive category.  So is CAT(C,Set) a distributive
category?  And if so, is DCAT(CAT(C,Set),Set) equivalent to C?  And what
about the enriched case V-DCAT(V-CAT(C,V),V)?

This reminded me of a long-standing torture: does anybody know an elementary
proof at least of the particular case when the base ring - thus the dualizer
too - has only two elements? (Demanded by Guram Bezhanishvili; I agreed to
try thinking on this one as it seemed somehow close to Boolean algebras,
but...)

In addition to Peter's nice collection of self-dualities there are the
Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories of "the" covariant power-set monad
(there are really two such monads but either will do), respectively Rel
and complete semilattices, both self-dual.  One that Mike Barr introduced
me to is the subcategory of Rel whose morphisms are the partial
injections, those binary relations such that if (x,y) and (x,z) are both
present then y = z and likewise for their converses.  My personal
favorites are finite chains with bottom (showing that \Delta, as the base
category of the presheaf category of simplicial sets, comes very close to
being self-dual; had \Delta itself been self-dual, Set^{\Delta\op} and
Set^\Delta would have been the same thing), and semilattices with a top
and all nonempty sups (my candidate for a self-dual system of event/state
structures before I replaced it with Chu spaces).

One should also mention the topological vector spaces in Barr's book on
*-autonomous categories, whose self-duality does for the
finite-dimensional vector spaces mentioned by Peter what Pontryagin
duality does for finite abelian groups.

A feature of Chu spaces I particularly like is that each of the above,
as well as finite-dimensional vector spaces and finite abelian groups,
can be described as that full subcategory of Chu(Set,K) (K = 2 except
for vector spaces and abelian groups) consisting of biextensional Chu
spaces whose rows and columns satisfy the same closure conditions.  For
example the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over GF(2) (a
sneaky way to stick to Chu(Set,2)) embeds in Chu(Set,2) as precisely
those finite biextensional Chu spaces whose rows and columns, viewed as
bit vectors in the sense a machine-language programmer understands the
concept, are both closed under bitwise XOR.  This example is given as an
exercise at the end of Chapter 2 of
http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/coimbra.pdf, my notes for the July 1999
Coimbra School cotaught with John Baez and Cristina Pedicchio.
Proposition 2.2 in the same chapter obtains complete semilattices (of
any cardinality) as those Chu spaces whose rows and columns are closed
under bitwise OR, with the self-duality of CSLat as the immediate
Corollary 2.3.  This shows that the self-dualities CSLat and
Vct_{GF(2)}, at least for finite objects, arise identically except for
how they combine their bit-vectors, namely with respectively OR and XOR.
