The indiscrete-category functor I: Set -> Cat is not algebraically
exact as I claimed in my posting of October 9. But I is
a full codomain restriction of one: as in that posting, let F
be the forgetful functor the Gabriel-Ulmer theory T
of categories to the theory of sets. Then Alg F is an algebraically
exact functor from Set to Alg T, and the Yoneda embedding
Y: Cat -> Alg T is fully faithful (since the dual of T is dense in Cat).
It is easy to see that Alg F is naturally isomorphic to Y.I , thus,
I preserves sifted colimits.

                            Special Issue
                                  of
                      Information & Computation
                                  on
                   Structural Operational Semantics

Aim: Structural operational semantics (SOS) provides a framework
for giving operational semantics to programming and specification
languages. A growing number of programming languages from
commercial and academic spheres have been given usable semantic
descriptions by means of structural operational semantics. Because
of its intuitive appeal and flexibility, structural operational
semantics has found considerable application in the study of the
semantics of concurrent processes. Moreover, it is becoming a
viable alternative to denotational semantics in the static analysis
of programs, and in proving compiler correctness.

Recently, structural operational semantics has been successfully
applied as a formal tool to establish results that hold for classes
of process description languages. This has allowed for the
generalisation of well-known results in the field of process
algebra, and for the development of a meta-theory for process
calculi based on the realization that many of the results in this
field only depend upon general semantic properties of language
constructs.

This special issue aims at documenting state-of-the-art research, new
developments and directions for future investigation in the field of
structural operational semantics. Specific topics of interest include
(but are not limited to):

  * programming languages
  * process algebras
  * higher-order formalisms
  * rule formats for operational specifications
  * meaning of operational specifications
  * comparisons between denotational, axiomatic and operational semantics
  * compositionality of modal logics with respect to
    operational specifications
  * congruence with respect to behavioural equivalences
  * conservative extensions
  * derivation of proof rules from operational specifications
  * software tools that automate, or are based on, SOS.

Papers reporting on applications of SOS to software engineering and
other areas of computer science are welcome.

This special issue is an outgrowth of the series of SOS workshops,
which started in 2004, and serves in part as a opportunity to publish
the full versions of the best papers presented at SOS 2006. However,
papers that were not presented at SOS 2006 are equally welcome, and
all submissions will be refereed and subjected to the same quality
criteria, meeting the standards of Information and Computation.

Papers submitted to the special issue must contain original material
that has not previously been published, and parallel submission for
publication elsewhere is not allowed. However, an extended abstract or
short version of the paper may be submitted for presentation at the
SOS 2007 workshop, which will take place before the publication of the
special issue.

PAPER SUBMISSION:

We solicit unpublished papers reporting on original research on the
general theme of SOS.  Papers should take the form of a dvi, postscript or
pdf file. We recommend following Elsevier's instructions at
     http://authors.elsevier.com/JournalDetail.html?PubID=622844
and using LaTeX2e with documentclass elsart.

IMPORTANT DATES:

  * Submission of tentative title and abstract: 15 December 2006

I was going through some of my old notes today and came across
investigations I had done several years ago on implicit operations in
Universal Algebra.  These are definable partial operations on algebras
that are preserved by all homomorphisms.  Here are two examples:

(1) Pseudocomplements in distributive lattices.  Given a <= b <= c in a
distributive lattice, there is at most one b' such that

     b /\ b' = a   and   b \/ b' = c.

Because lattice homomorphisms preserve these inequalities and equations,
the uniqueness of pseudocomplements implies that, when they exist, they
are also preserved by homomorphisms.

(2) Multiplicative inverses in monoids.  Similarly, given an element m
in a monoid (M, *, 1), there is at most one element m' such that

     m * m' = 1    and    m' * m = 1.

It follows that inverses, when they exist, are also preserved by monoid
homomorphisms.

Now, the investigation of these partial operations gets one quickly into
non-surjective epimorphisms, dominions in the sense of Isbell, algebraic
elements in the sense of Bacsich, implicit partial operations in the
sense of Hebert, and other topics.  Some of the references that I know
about are listed below.

My question is this:  Does a definitive treatment of this phenomenon in
"algebraic" categories exist?  Are there still some mysteries/open problems?

Hi everyone,

Todd Wilson asks :

ems?

It seems to me that the problem of
"characterizing the algebraic theories giving rise to varieties where all=
 the epis are surjective"
(posed by Bill Lawvere in
Some algebraic problems in the context..., LNM 61 (1968) )
is still essentially open. Anyone knows otherwise?
(A "classical" version might be to find a - syntactic-  condition on the =
equations necessary and sufficient to have all epis surjective in its cat=
egory of its models)

   [New: CSFW is dropping its "W" and possibly becoming a symposium
 already in 2007 (subject to approval by the IEEE Computer Society).]

			   Call For Papers

       20th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop (CSF)
		   Venice, Italy, July 6 - 8, 2007

     Sponsored by the Technical Committee on Security and Privacy
		     of the IEEE Computer Society

CSF20 website:     http://www.dsi.unive.it/CSFW20/
CSF home page:     http://www.ieee-security.org/CSFWweb/
CSF CFP:           http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~andrei/CSF07/cfp.html

The IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop (CSF) series brings
together researchers in computer science to examine foundational
issues in computer security. Over the past two decades, many seminal
papers and techniques have been presented first at CSF. The CiteSeer
Impact page (http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/impact.html ) lists CSF as
38th out of more than 1200 computer science venues in impact (top
3.11%) based on citation frequency. There is a possibility of
upgrading CSF to an IEEE symposium already in 2007.

New theoretical results in computer security are welcome. Also welcome
are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open questions
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories. Panel
proposals are welcome as well as papers. Possible topics include, but
are not limited to:


  Authentication    Access control    Distributed systems
  Information flow  Trust and trust   security
  Security          management        Security for mobile
  protocols         Security models   computing
  Anonymity and     Intrusion         Executable content
  Privacy           detection         Decidability and
  Electronic voting Data and system   complexity
  Network security  integrity         Formal methods for
  Resource usage    Database security security
  control                             Language-based
                                      security

Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press will be
available at the workshop, and selected papers will be invited for
submission to the Journal of Computer Security.

Important Dates

Workshop Location

The 20th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop will be held in
the facilities of Venice International University, located on the
island of San Servolo, about 10 minutes by water ferry from the Piazza
San Marco.

Instructions for Participants

Although submission is open to anyone, attendance is by invitation.
All authors of accepted papers are invited to attend, and authors are
required to ensure that at least one will be present. This year's
meeting location will allow us to invite more participants than
previous years.

Submission Instructions

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have
been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with published proceedings. Papers should be submitted in
Postscript or Portable Document Format (PDF). Papers submitted in a
proprietary word processor format such as Microsoft Word cannot be
considered. At least one coauthor of each accepted paper is required
to attend CSF to present the paper.

Papers may be submitted using the two-column IEEE Proceedings style
available for various document preparation systems at IEEE-CS
Press. Papers in this style should be at most 12 pages long, not
counting bibliography and well-marked appendices. Alternatively,
papers can be in Springer LLNCS style. In LLNCS style papers must be
at most 20 pages long excluding the bibliography and well-marked
appendices.

Committee members are not required to read appendices, and so the
paper must be intelligible without them. Papers not adhering to the
page limits will be rejected without consideration of their merits.

The paper submission website will be open in January 2007.

Proposals for panels are also welcome. They should be no more than
five pages in length and should include possible panelists and an
indication of which of those panelists have confirmed a desire to
participate. They should be submitted by email to the program chair by
March 15, 2007.

A session of five-minute talks was successful in the last two years,
so we are likely to have one again in 2007. Abstracts will be
solicited in May.

Dear colleagues,

Does anyone know whether every extensive and locally finitely presentable
category fulfils the following condition:

For every omega op-chain of coproduct injections i_n: A_n+1 -> A_n
with all A_n finitely presentable some i_n is an isomorphism.

We need this for investigating iterative monads in such categories,
and we have not managed to prove it, nor to find a counterexample.

Thanks,
Jiri Adamek, Stefan Milius and Jiri Velebil
