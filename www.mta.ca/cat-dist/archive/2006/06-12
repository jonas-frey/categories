PSSL 85 in Nice - first announcement

It is proposed to hold the 85th meeting of the
Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic in Nice
during the weekend of 24/25 March 2007.

We expect to have some money available to support
students' and postdocs' attendance at the conference.
If you are interested please write to Eugenia Cheng.

For those unfamiliar with PSSLs, they are a
long-running series of meetings, usually held on a
weekend at a university somewhere in Europe. They are
fairly informal, and presentations of work in progress
are quite acceptable.  The name is a (charming)
historical relic: talks cover all aspects of category
theory, not just sheaves and logic.

Further details of the arrangements will be announced
by early February and posted at the following website:

http://math.unice.fr/~eugenia/pssl85 .

In the meantime if you have any questions please do not
hesitate to contact me.


Regards,
Eugenia Cheng

CALL FOR TALKS AND PARTICIPATION

Universal Structures in Mathematics and Computing

http://usmc07.rsise.anu.edu.au

The Australian National University
Canberra, Australia
5 - 7 February 2007

Aim:

Starting from very different motivations, various groups of
mathematicians and computer scientists have sought to describe
abstract structures in great generality. This parallel evolutionary
process has led to various groups of researchers working on highly
interrelated areas, though unable to effectively communicate with
each other due to vastly differing languages.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers working in category
theory, universal algebra, logic and their applications to computer
science in order to highlight recent advances in these fields and to
facilitate dialogue between the different camps. Of particular
interest is work which spans two or more of these areas.

Structure and Scope:

The workshop will consist of several invited keynote talks as well as
shorter contributed talks. Topics of interest include (but are not
limited to):

* Operads and related structures
* Higher dimensional categories
* Coalgebras
* Clones in universal algebra
* Residuated lattices
* Algebraic logic
* Linear and other substructural logics
* Higher dimensional automata
* Concurrency theory
* Domain theory
* Type theory

Keynote Speakers:

   * Brian Davey (La Trobe, Australia)
   * Rob Goldblatt (VUW, New Zealand)
   * Ross Street (Macquarie, Australia)
   * Glynn Winskel (Cambridge, UK)

Talk submissions:

We solicit talks on topics related to the themes and spirit of the
workshop. We aim to facilitate all those who wish to speak at the
workshop. Submission of talks can be made by email to Alwen Tiu
(Alwen.Tiu@rsise.anu.edu.au) or Jon Cohen
(Jonathan.Cohen@rsise.anu.edu.au).

Registration:

Registration for the workshop can be done online through the workshop
website. The online registration will be opened on Friday, 15th
December 2006 until 2nd February 2007.

* Full registration:    AU$ 55 (incl. GST)
* Student registration: AU$ 35 (incl. GST)


Important Dates and Information:

* Deadline for registration: 2nd February 2007
* Deadline for talk titles and abstracts submission: 19th January 2007
* Workshop: 5 - 7 February 2007

Accommodation:

A limited number of rooms have been reserved at University House
(http://www.anu.edu.au/unihouse/) and Ursula College (http://
ursula.anu.edu.au/Ursula/12.html). Please quote the workshop name
"USMC workshop" when reserving the rooms.

In addition, there are many hotels and hostels for those wishing to
arrange their own accommodation. Locations in the city centre as well
as the suburbs of Turner and Braddon are within walking distance of
the university.
Details can be found at http://www.canberratourism.com.au/.

Sponsors:

The workshop is sponsored by the Australian Mathematical Sciences
Institute (AMSI) and National ICT Australia.


Travel support:

There are limited travel funds available to support students and
early-career researchers from AMSI members. Applications of funds
have to be made directly to AMSI. See http://www.amsi.org.au for
details.

Organising Committee:

   * Jonathan Cohen (ANU and NICTA)
   * Brian Davey (La Trobe)
   * Greg Restall (Melbourne)

Dear categorists,

I would like to announce that the following preprint is available from my
webpage

www.math.upatras.gr/~pkarazer

P. Karazeris and J. Velebil, Dense morphisms of monads.

Abstract:
Given an arbitrary locally finitely presentable category K and finitary
monads T and S on K,
we characterize monad morphisms \alpha : S --> T with the property that
the induced functor \alpha _* : K^T --> K^S
between the categories of Eilenberg-Moore algebras is fully faithful.
We call such monad morphisms dense and give a characterization of them in
the spirit of Beth&#8217;s definability theorem: \alpha is a dense monad
morphism
if and only if every T-operation is explicitly defined using S-operations.
We also give a characterization in terms of epimorphic property of \alpha
and clarify the connection between various notions of epimorphisms
between monads.

The above work bears some relation to the question posed by Todd Wilson on
implicitly definable operations. The connection though with non-surjective
epimorphisms is not pursued here.

Best regards,
Panagis Karazeris

Dear colleagues,

I happened to know now of a strange, seemingly incredible, connection =20=

between the Elsevier publishing company and arms fairs.

There is a dedicated web page:

http://cage.ugent.be/~npg/elsevier/index.html

Quoting from the beginning:

"  Background on Elsevier and the arms trade

If you are an academic then you may well know the publishing house =20
Reed-Elsevier as a publisher of your papers. What you may not know is =20=

that they also have a sideline organising arms fairs. Through its =20
subsidiary companies, Reed Exhibitions and Spearhead Exhibitions, =20
Reed Elsevier is responsible for organising major arms fairs in =20
several countries across the world, as well as here in the UK.
The majority of Reed's work is in providing information services and =20
publications for a wide variety of professional groups whose work is =20
in the public interest. Consequently it is surprising that they would =20=

want to muddy their good work by involvement in the arms trade. It =20
also means that they have received significant criticism from =20
professional groups who use their more legitimate services.  "  (end =20
of citation.)
---

More information can be found on other links of the previous page. =20
For instance:

http://cage.ugent.be/~npg/elsevier/Reedbackgrounder.pdf

or reading the following letter from "Timesonline" (March 1, 2006), =20
signed also by JM Coetzee, a Nobel prize winner:

http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25390-2064400,00.html

---

The replies I have seen to all that seem to be of the following kind:

[from the "Timesonline" article cited above] "Reed Exhibitions have =20
publicly insisted that =93the defence industry is central to the =20
preservation of freedom and national security=94.   (end of citation.)

I think that all scientists are concerned, in particular our group.

With kind regards

Marco Grandis

                       2nd Call for Papers

  1st International Workshop on Quality Aspects of Coordination (QAC'07)

                 June 4-5, 2007, Shanghai, China

                    http://www.cwi.nl/qac07/

*******************************************************************************

Overview and Topics of Interest:

Modeling, analysis, and ensuring end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS)
represent key concerns in large-scale distributed applications.
Deregulation and increased competition in the telecommunications
industry mean that, increasingly, providers use components and services
offered by multiple vendors to compose such applications.  This
highlights the conspicuous absence of compositional models of QoS that
reflect their underlying architecture of component/service composition.

Connectors have emerged as a powerful concept for composition and
coordination of concurrent activities encapsulated as components and
services. Compositional coordination models and languages serve as a
means to formally specify and implement component and service
connectors. They support large-scale distributed applications by
allowing construction of complex component connectors out of simpler
ones. A promising approach to support compositional models of QoS
involves augmenting connector models to reflect and account for the QoS
properties of composed systems. This presents an emerging area of
research with potential high impact. Dynamic changes in a distributed
environment may lead to scarcity of resources (e.g., bandwidth, CPU
cycles, and memory), and cause perceptible degradation of QoS of a
running application. Offering performance guarantees to satisfy users'
end-to-end QoS requirements raises additional challenges for component
connectors. It involves monitoring fluctuations that can trigger such
degradations, and escalating them to the proper architectural levels
where actors can take counter-measures such as substitution of alternate
components and services from other vendors.

The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for international experts
to discuss issues related to coordination and compositional models of
connectors with QoS guarantees in large-scale distributed systems.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Compositional QoS models
* Compositional models for connectors and coordination with QoS
* Quantitative models for components and connectors
* Relation between QoS in adjacent architectural layers
* Modeling and analysis of trade-offs along different QoS dimensions
* QoS issues in coordination of web services
* Performance of middleware-based architectures
* QoS-sensitive monitoring and adaptation mechanisms
* Dynamic reconfiguration of systems and connectors
* Quantitative model checking
* Testing quantitative models
* Experience with QoS in coordination (case studies)

Submission and Proceedings

Submissions to the workshop will be evaluated on the basis of
originality, relevance, technical soundness and presentation
quality. Papers should be written in English and not exceed 15

[Note from moderator: as the poster points out, categories is not a forum
for political discussion. Consequently, further messages on this topic
received before Monday will be digested and posted then, closing the
discussion.]

Dear Colleagues,

I am responding to the posting of Marco Grandis.

I would like to express my heartfelt admiration to all those who raised
their voice against Elsevier's involvement in the arms trade. I find it so
noble that many scientists found time to express their outrage and
protest.

At the same time, I cannot help saying that I find the whole initiative
childishly naive, and even somewhat hypocritical. Naive, because
apparently, they believe that wars are because of the arms trade -- in
other words, they seem to mistake the cause with the result. (If there
were no wars, would there be any point in manufacturing weapons? Let me
ask it clearer: Would it bring *profit* to manufacture arms in that
case??)

And I said hypocritical, because I do wonder where the same good souls
were at the time of the invasion of Iraq, during the war in the Balkan, or
what do they think about what is happening in Israel. I wonder if the same
worried scientists who propose to boycott Reed-Elsevier have already
signed the academic boycott against Israel, and would participate in a
similar action against the US as a protest against its foreign policy.

I am raising these issues not in order to generate a political discussion
on a categories forum (which is definitely not the appropriate place for
such a discussion), but rather to illuminate the disproportional nature of
the suggestion action. It appears to me an overreaction, and directed
against the wrong entity.


With best wishes,

Gabor Lukacs

Dear all,

Here is a probably easy question on categorical logic.

If I understood correctly from Bart Jacobs' book [1], a topos, besides
its elementary definitions, e.g., as a complete CCC with a subobject
classifier, may be defined as a category whose subobject fibration is
a higher-order fibration.

Such subobject higher-order fibrations always have extensional
entailment, in the sense that logical equivalence implies internal
equality (which in HOL is necessarily Leibniz equality modulo iso).

My question is twofold:

 (a) Is there an intensional equivalent to the notion of topos? In
     other words, is there a widely accepted categorical, elementary
     characterization of HOL?

 (b) If so, for these HOL categories, is there an analogue of the
     definition in terms of subobject fibrations? For instance, is it
     the case that for such HOL categories, e.g., the fibration of
     monos (or the codomain fibration) is a higher-order fibration?

The question might be equivalent to: is there a well-established pair
of a fibred construction F and an elementary doctrine D, such that for
all category C,

   C is in D iff F (C) is a HO fibration?

However, I am highly unsure that this formulation makes sense.

Thanks and all that,

  Tom

A year ago I wondered if linear distributivity was an example of a Beck
distributivity.  The answer is "sort of".  I wrote a sort of paper on the
subject and sort of submitted it to a TAC editor who sort of asked for a
referee report.  The resultant not-quite report sort of rejected it
(actually asked for more work that I felt it was worth) and with the help
of the editor I decided to just post it.  So there it is, titled Beck
distributivity, on my pdffile site:

Dear Gabor,

In support of those who raised their voice in this matter (namely, Marco
Grandis), I would like to say that although maybe naive, this alarm call is
surely not even mildly hypocritical. Notice that to protest against one
particular issue does not exclude protesting about others, surely more
fundamental as you rightly point out in this case. For this reason, I think
that your questioning in the paragraph below is out of order and calls for a
retraction. It seems to me that you assume too much about those who were
brave enough to let us all be aware of this issue, and to whom we should be
grateful.


>And I said hypocritical, because I do wonder where the same good souls were
>at the time of the invasion of Iraq, during the war in the Balkan, or what
>do they think about what is happening in Israel. I wonder if the same
>worried scientists who propose to boycott Reed-Elsevier have already
>signed the academic boycott against Israel, and would participate in a
>similar action against the US as a protest against its foreign policy.

In a more detailed answer to this paragraph, I firmly believe (from
first-hand knowledge) that the same worried scientists who would sign a
petition to criticize Reed-Elsevier would also sign petitions against
unjustified wars and invasions, such as those perpetrated by the current US
government and its allies (and that includes the UK and Israel -- although I
find that the latter is a trickier issue and tends to be simplistically
confused with antisemitism). Any of such actions may be considered naive in
view of the results they cause (well -- not always! see the recent US
elections) -- nevertheless it is the duty of any conscientious scientist to
raise his/her voice against any crimes against humanity, regardless of who
perpetrates them.

The case of Reed-Elsevier touches us more closely than any other, as (say)
mathematicians who publish in reputed journals cannot simply ignore Journal
of Pure and Aplided Algebra, Topology, Advances in Mathematics, etc. This
case, unlike the larger and more fundamental issues, is within our reach,
and that is what makes it so special. I fully agree with Marco Grandis
having raised the alarm in this forum, precisley for this reason.
Unlike you,  I am not wondering why is he (or others) not doing likewise
with other causes in this same forum. The reason is simple -- this is an
ACADEMIC matter and therefore, as academics (not politicians), we can in
principle do something effective about it. We may individually sign lots of
other petitions, write letters to newspapers, and disseminate difficult to
get inflormation colncerning the larger and more fundamental  issues. But to
bring those larger issues to the attention of this forum would, in my view,
and I am sure also in the view of ther moderators,  be inappropriate. This,
on the other hand, is not.


I understand that the entire editorial board of Topology recently resigned
as a protest against their profiteering (without much effort -- who does the
writing of papers, refereeing, preparing camera ready articles or
proofreading? not them -- yet they charge outrageous prices for their
journals), knowing far too well that Thirld World countries cannot afford
such outrageous subsciptions. Would it be possible to promote such an action
for this far more important issue of arms dealing (a worse case of
profiteering and also more inmoral as it concerns human lives, not "just"
access to scikentific journals)?

To end, I largely agree with your concerns. I am only asking you to be less
judgemental in your assesments without analysing the situation further. It
may be unjust and hence unnecessarily insulting.

Best wishes,
Marta

Hi.

I would like to make two points in response to Gabor Lukacz's post.

1)  The reasoning that arms dealers just cater to the market, and bear
no responsibility for wars or murders --- applies to drug dealers
equally well. Indeed, the same reasoning appears not only in the charter
of the National Rifle Association, but also in interviews of Pablo
Escobar, who would say something like:

> (If there were no [cocaine users], would there be any point in
> manufacturing [cocaine]? Let me
> ask it clearer: Would it bring *profit* to manufacture [cocaine] in
> that case??)


2) It is not obvious to me that a scientific venue, such as the
Categories mailing list, is a priori inappropriate to discuss
publishers' motives. Lancet is another scientific venue, and they found
it appropriate to oppose Elsevier's stance.

We probably cannot avoid the fact that the dissemination methods of a
science influence its contents, and the way people set up their research
goals. The presence of TAC, and maybe even of this very list, have
probably influenced category theory research. Elsevier has probably
influenced category theory research. Most of that influence was probably
positive. But the world is changing, Elsevier is changing and it might
make sense to exchange thoughts on how their changes may influence our
research. That does not seem to be out of scope of this list.

all the best,
-- dusko

Following Gabor's line of reasoning, and paying the utmost attention
not to confuse cause with effect, it would be OK for us to invest in
narcotics: after all, if people wouldn't use drugs, we wouldn't be
making any money, the market would regulate itself and we would get
what we deserve.

I have to add that I missed the connection with Iraq and the rest.
There is an elephant in the room that Gabor seems to fail to notice:
if the allegations are true, Elsevier would be investing money we
directly make for them with our own (unpaid) work. Which -- whatever
side you take in the dispute -- makes a call for boycott legitimate.
My pension fund is bound to ethical investments, my employer too; I
don't see why I shouldn't ask so for my publisher.

Dear Marta,


Let me start from the end of your message, where you mentioned the
resignation of the entire editorial board of Topology. I find their action
quite reasonable and appropriate, because it is primarily an academic
issue. Furthermore, preventing access to knowledge serves the perpetuation
of poverty and the current division of power/property in the world. Thus,
the pressure excerted on the publisher this way has the potential of being
helpful.

Now to the original question. I do not question, even for a single moment,
the subjective good intent of those who protest and raise their voice.
Nevertheless, objectively, I do find it hypocritical to protest against
the arms trade, and not against the those who *use* or *buy* the arms. I
find it a cheap lip service to complain about prostitutes and remain
silent about the clients. What makes the arms trade profitable are
precisely those countries (among them our beloved Land of Freedom, the US)
who buy the weapons. I do not think it is sensible to make reproaches to
these companies.

Capitalism is about maximazing profit, not about the people's welfare.
(Even if many measures are sold to the public as such!) Thus, the
existence of the arms industry is just a consequence, not a cause. Trying
to make it vanish helps as much as curing the symptoms of the plague.

This issue bothers me for the same reason that I am bothered by
animal-rights activists (who feel sorry for the poor-poor dogs and cats,
but often seem to be less sensitive to the problems of their fellow
humans) -- it distracts the attention from the real problem, and creates
artificial ones.

There are many entities that could/should be boycotted. However, before
someone would join a boycott of Elsevier, they should ask themselves: When
did they visit the US last time...?

> It seems to me that you assume too much about those who were brave

I think this is exactly the point -- I do not find it brave at all to
boycott a publisher. In fact, it looks like a very cheap way of relieving
oneself from the responsibility of taking a real action, and this is what
I find hypocritical about it. If someone is brave, s/he should refuse to
participate in conferences in the US, or even boycott US academics
altogether (as you all know, a similar initiative is in place against
Israel). Personally, I am not sure if this is the area where I would like
show my courage, but I would certainly admire anyone who would organize
such a boycott. Because THAT takes a lot of courage.

> nevertheless it is the duty of any conscientious scientist to raise

> perpetrates them.

I fully agree with you on this. However, in my opinion, the crime is not
manufacturing a weapon, but *using* it.

Let me repeat that I was not question at all the subjective good intent of
the posting or anyone involved.

With warmest regards,

Gabor Lukacs

Along with Springer, Bertelsmann, Gordon & Breach and any other publisher
who is killing our libraries with their outrageous prices.  We category
theorists have TAC, for example, and there are other possibilities.  I
have just had a paper (in point set topology) accepted by Mathematica
Japonica, who publish in all areas of math.

What gripes me about these publishers is that as their costs decline
(typesetting was once their largest cost and is now almost gone) their
prices go up.  It has been almost 12 years since I have anything to do
with these publishers, as referee or author.  I did hang on as editor for
a few more years since it was the only way McGill could get JPAA.

Just one more comment.  Although I don't think the arms trade would
decline if Elsevier didn't participate, I also would not want to be
associated with anyone involved in the trade.  I do not delude myself into
thinking that my repugnance would have any effect.  On the other hand, a
boycott of these publishers by mathematicians in general would certainly
have an effect.

Michael

Dear all,

Here is a canonical, but perhaps not trivial, way of constructing an
algebra for any finitary algebraic theory.  Does anyone know anything
about it?  E.g. is there existing work on it, or an alternative
description?

Take a finitary monad (T, eta, mu) on Set.  We construct an algebra A
for the monad in three steps:

(i) Let C be the terminal coalgebra for the endofunctor T (which exists
since T is finitary).

(ii) Regard C as an algebra for the endofunctor T (via Lambek's Lemma:
the structure map of C is invertible).

(iii) Turn C into an algebra A for the monad (T, eta, mu) by applying
the left adjoint to the inclusion

    (T, eta, mu)-Alg ----> T-Alg.


Here are two examples.

1. Fix a monoid M and let (T, eta, mu) be the theory of left M-sets.
Then C is the set of infinite sequences (m_1, m_2, ...) of elements of
M, and A = C/~ where ~ is generated by

    (m_1, m_2, ...) ~ (m_1 ... m_n, m_{n+1}, m_{n+2}, ...)

for any natural number n and m_i in M.

2. Let (T, eta, mu) be the theory of monoids.  Then C is the set of
infinite planar trees in which each vertex may have any natural number
of branches ascending from it (or descending, according to convention).
Next, A = C/~ where ~ is generated by

    s o (t_1, ..., t_n) ~ s' o (t_1, ..., t_n)

for any finite n-leafed trees s, s' and t_1, ..., t_n in C.  Here "o"
means "grafting": the left-hand side is the union of s and the (t_i)s,
with the root of t_i glued to the i-th leaf of s.

Hence A is the set of equivalence classes of infinite trees, where two
trees are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by altering
just a finite portion at its base.

This equivalence relation (or actually, the analogous one for
commutative monoids) is what made me start thinking about all this.

Thanks,
Tom

At first glance Tom's canonical algebra seems as though it should be
closely related to what came out of the last 26 messages of

http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1988/

starting with John Mitchell's question of 9 Nov 88, message 155, as to
whether initiality was the right criterion for correctness of an
implementation of an algebraic data type.  Satish Thatte in message 174
suggested Mitch Wand's "Final Algebra Semantics" from JCSS 1979 as more
appropriate, in particular Wand's main theorem that every standard
conservative extension has a maximal base-conservative augment, or as I
put it in 176 (= 177), "Every biconservative extension of an equational
theory has a
greatest base-conservative augment."  I then conjectured that it could
be extended to "Every extension of an equational theory has an optimal
base-conservative augment", and commented that "There is only thing
bothering me about all this.  It seems too nice, elementary, and useful
to be not already known to logicians.  Anyone seen anything like this
outside Wand's paper?".  In message 178 Satish Thatte pointed out that
my optimal augment did indeed always exist, namely as the intersection
of all maximal base-conservative augments.

In the final paragraph of the final message (180) in that series, with
subject "final algebras", I wrote "In any event I don't see how category
theory is helping here, indeed this would seem to be an instance where
category theory hinders more than it helps."  If Tom's construction is
equivalent then I sure got that wrong.  If the algebras are different it
would be nice to understand what the differences and relative merits of
the two are - seems to me they ought at least to be related.  I wish my
memory went back that far.

Here is the answer:

Consider the category of pairs of sets X,Y together with an isomorphism s:XxY->Y, with
inverse Y->XxY, Y|->(py,qy). Then X is locally finitely presentable, because it is a two-sorted
variety with operations s,p,q and equations s(py,qy)=y=qs(x,y), ps(x,y)=x. One might think of
the elements of Y as versions of sequences in X; an element y can be considered as a
version of the sequence (pq^n(y))_n, where n runs over all natural numbers (including 0).
Then p maps evey "sequence" to its initial (0-th) member, q means ommitting the initial
member, an s(x,y) is obtained from y by adding the new initial member x. Then it is quite
easy to see that the category is also extensive.

The free algebra A=(N,S) on one element of Y can then be described as follows: N is the set
of natural numbers and s is the set of all sequences (x(n))_n in N with the property that the
exisit a natural number m and an integer k with x(n)=n+k for all n>m; p is the projection
(x(n))_n|->x(0) to the 0-th component, and q is the left shift (x(n))_n|->(x(n+1))_n. The
algebra A is freely generated by the sequence g:=(n)_n of natural numbers; every element of
S can be obtained from g by first shifting left several times and then shifting right with
inserting arbitary natural numbers in the initial component; every n in N can be obtained as
n=pq^n(g).

The free algebra on one element of X is ({0},0,...), where 0 is the empty set. Now the
coproduct A+B is isomorphic to A with injections i:A->A,  j:B->A, where i is the sucessor map
n|->n+1 and j maps 0 to 0 in the first component; this uniquely determines the second
components (because "different versions of the same sequence do not occur".) Now A_n:=n
and i_n:=i for all n in N yields a counterexample to the above statement.

                                                                       Greetings

Dear colleagues,

The Globe and Mail today printed an article on Gabor Lukacs, based on an
interview solicited by the paper. The printed edition has color photos,
which the email edition does not.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061214.PROF14/TPStory/?q=
uery=3DGabor+Lukacs

Lukacs was flying off to Budapest last week without being sure of what
exactly the article would contain, but it seems from what he told me that
they have indeed paid attention to his requests.

Congratulations, Gabi!

Marta

CALCO brings together researchers and practitioners to exchange new
results related to foundational aspects and both traditional and
emerging uses of algebras and coalgebras in computer science.

This is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces
and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods
in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development
Techniques). The first CALCO conference took place 2005 in Swansea,
Wales (http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/calco/index.php), and was a huge success.
The second event will take place August 2007 in Bergen, Norway.

CALCO 2007 will be preceded by two events on August 20, 2007.

   * CALCO-jnr - a CALCO Young Researchers Workshop dedicated to
     presentations by PhD students and by those who completed
     their doctoral studies within the past few years.
     See separate announcements for CALCO-jnr.

   * CALCO Tools Day - providing the opportunity to give
     system demonstrations. See below for more information.

There are separate submission procedures for the CALCO main conference,
CALCO-jnr and CALCO Tools Day, respectively.


Topics of Interest
------------------
We invite submissions of technical papers that report results of
theoretical work on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the
way these results can support methods and techniques for software
development, as well as experience with the transfer of resulting
technologies into industrial practice. We encourage submissions in
topics included or related to those in the lists below.

   * Abstract models and logics
     - Automata and languages,
     - Categorical semantics,
     - Modal logics,
     - Relational systems,
     - Graph transformation,
     - Term rewriting,
     - Adhesive categories

   * Specialised models and calculi
     - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems,
     - Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed,
       mobile, and context-aware computing,
     - General systems theory and computational models
       (chemical, biological, etc)

   * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
     - Abstract data types,
     - Inductive and coinductive methods,
     - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation),
     - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques,
     - Semantics of programming languages

   * System specification and verification
     - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification,
     - Formal testing and quality assurance,
     - Validation and verification,
     - Generative programming and model-driven development,
     - Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
       hardware/middleware/architectures,
     - Process algebra


Submission Guidelines
---------------------
Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Experience papers
are welcome, but they must clearly present general lessons learned
that would be of interest and benefit to a broad audience of both
researchers and practitioners. As in 2005, it is planned to publish
the proceedings in the Springer LNCS series. Final papers will be
no more than 15 pages long in the format specified by Springer. It
is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length
(see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). Submissions that
are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Proofs omitted due
to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.
Both an abstract and the full paper must be submitted by their respective
submission deadlines.  Paper submissions should be made electronically
at
http://sttt.cs.uni-dortmund.de/calco07/servlet/Conference

A special issue of the new high-quality open access journal Logical
Methods in Computer Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), consisting of
extended versions of selected papers will be produced after the conference
if there are enough good papers that can be extended and revised to the
standards of this journal.

Location and Organisation
-------------------------
Bergen was Norway's first capital from the 13th century, and up until the
1830's Norway's biggest town. Its placement has made it a natural point
through which foreign influences penetrated to Norway and Scandinavia
and the Norwegian export was leaving the country. For some centuries it
was part of the Hanseatic League with export of fish and timber. Many
of the wooden houses and larger facilities from the Hanseatic times
survived fires and modernisation and make up today a charming town
center.  Nowadays Bergen is small by international standards, but it
has always been a meeting place for people and a centre for commerce
and culture. Spectacular fjords and mountains surrounding the town,
combined with a lively and sociable atmosphere, make it a worthwhile
place to visit.

The conference will be held at Grand Hotel Terminus in the centre of
Bergen. The hotel will handle room bookings individually.  A social
programme will complement the scientific event.

Sponsored by Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen
University College, and IFIP WG1.3 on Foundations of System
Specification. Further sponsorships pending.


CALCO Tools Day
---------------
A special day at CALCO'07 is dedicated to tools based on algebraic
and coalgebraic principles. These include systems/prototypes/tools
developed specifically for design, checking, execution, and verification
of (co)algebraic specifications, but also tools targeting different
application domains but making core or interesting use of (co)algebraic
techniques. Tool submissions should be no longer than 5 pages in the
LNCS format; the accepted tool papers will be included in the final
LNCS proceedings of the conference.  The tools should be available on
the web for download and evaluation. Each submission will be evaluated
by at least three reviewers; one or more of the reviewers will be asked
to download and run the tool. At least one of the authors of each tool
paper must attend the conference to demo the tool.
Submissions by e-mail to grosu@cs.uiuc.edu.

Important Dates (all in 2007)
February 17      Tools software and paper submissions due
March 28         Author notification
May 16           Camera ready due

Hi Dusko,

One of Elsevier's motives (and  other publishers) is close to
trying to corner the market
or at least squeeze out all the profit possible

we now have several ways to resist
1. choice of journal to which we submit papers
B. choice of journal for which we will perform slave labor (editing)
III. advice in re the above to our mentees

Dear Marta,

Thank you for your message!

>> they have indeed paid attention to his requests.

Indeed, although I do wish they included a little more from what I said
about Walter Tholen's role in getting to where I am now, and maybe a few
more words on the time I spent in Bremen and Halifax, which have also
played a role in my education. Personally, these mean to me much more than
the story about my escaping Hungary or my childhood.

My sense of justice dictates me to include below a few excerpts from the
interview (part of which was done by e-mail) that, unfortunately, did not
make it to the printed story.

Best wishes,

Gabi

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I consider myself very lucky to have had Walter as my PhD supervisor, and
I learned a lot from him, alhough I do wish I could have learned from him
even more. Behind his back, we (some of his students) call Walter <<our
Master>> -- even now, years after we finished our formal studies with
him."

"I feel that I owe a lot to Walter for everything that he did for me, for
being an emotionally very supportive supervisor, who gave me the freedom
to develop, and who pushed me to think with my own mind."

"Walter was the one who saw me at least once a week, but sometiems even
2-3 times a week he had to put up with me (must have been hard!), and with
my excitingly barging into his office, and starting to explain to him my
latest thoughts -- which often turned out to be wrong after a few minutes
of thinking. I think if someone asked Walter to say honestly what was the
biggest challange in supervising me he would say: <<Having the patience
for him.>>"

For those who cannot get a printed copy, I might add that the story
appeared as a 2-page spread in the centerfold of the main section of
the paper, and that the Globe and Mail is the largest daily national
newspaper in Canada. Such prominent placement is unusual for an
article on academia.

The article does not mention category theory, but it does mention that
Gabi might be in need of a girlfriend. Gabi, the Globe and Mail has a
circulation of 2 million; you better get ready for a flood of
applicants :)

Congratulations, -- Peter

I quit serving as an editor for Advances in Mathematics when it
was bought by Elsevier.  When I learned how bad the situation was,
I also quit refereeing for all Elsevier-run journals.

Dear Peter,


As I hinted in my earlier message to the categories list, had I been in
control of the article, I would have written it quite differently. The
journalist's original intent was not to mention Walter Tholen, or any of
my postdoctoral studies AT ALL because in her opinion, that is not
interesting for the public...

Without boring you with the details, let me just say that I spent the
WHOLE last day of mine before my departure to Europe arguing with the
journalist about this particular issue. The little that *was* eventually
mentioned about academics was a result of this 7-hour-long dialog (or
monologue?). Although she claims to be an expert of academic affairs, she
seemed to have a hard time to understand that an academic success or
achievement is the success of many academics (supervisors, colleagues,
etc.), who should be given due credit for their role.

The way I look at it is that: (a) Mathematics was exposed in the press,
which is a good thing; (b) Nothing terrible appeared about me, even if the
details of my social life are somewhat distorted (the reporter forgot to
mention that I eat cold beans out of a tin...); (c) She did not write
that I am a crook. So, after all, the article is OK...

Finally, I doubt that with the nerdy picture that was chosen for the
article I am going to be flooded with fan's letters.

But, Peter, your sense of humor did not deteriorate since I saw you last
time in Halifax, which is the real good news as far as I am concerned.

Thank you for writing to me/about me!


Best,

Gabi

I read John's manifesto, which was interesting.  One thing I do not
understand is the reluctance of libraries and universities to get involved
in this.  While TAC runs without any funding at all (except for the
trivial storage cost that Mt. Alison contributes), a journal publishing a
more typical 2000 pages a year would need at least a minimum of some
clerical support.  A donation of $50/year by 100 universities would go a
long way.

Several years ago one of my colleagues suggested starting a free journal
to be called McGill J. Math.  But there were so many naysayers in the
department that the idea never got off the ground.  As far as I can tell,
I was the only one to support the idea (and volunteer to help).  Pity.

Michael

Dear Categorists -

Here's an excerpt from "week242".

This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 242)
John Baez

This week I'd like to talk about a paper by Jeffrey Morton.  Jeff
is a grad student now working with me on topological quantum field
theory and higher categories.  I've already mentioned his work on
categorified algebra and quantum mechanics in "week236".  He'll be
be finishing his Ph.D. thesis in the spring of 2007 - and as usual,
that means he's already busy applying for jobs.

[stuff deleted]

10) Jeffrey Morton, A double bicategory of cobordisms with corners,
available as math.CT/0611930.

People have been talking a long time about topological quantum field
theory and higher categories.  The idea is that categories, 2-categories,
3-categories and the like can describe how manifolds can be chopped into
little pieces - or more precisely, how these little pieces can be glued
together to form manifolds.  Then the problem of doing quantum field
theory on some manifold can be reduced to the problem of doing it on
these pieces and gluing the results together.  This works easiest if
the theory is "topological", not requiring a background metric.

There's a lot of evidence that this is a good idea, but getting the details
straight has proved tough, even at the 2-category level.  This is what
Morton does, in a rather clever way.  Very roughly, his idea is to use
something I'll call a "weak double category", and prove that these:

 (n-2)-dimensional manifolds

 (n-1)-dimensional manifolds with boundary

  n-dimensional manifolds with corners

give a weak double category called nCob_2.  The proof is a cool mix of
topology and higher category theory.  He then shows that this particular
weak double category can be reinterpreted as something a bit more
familiar - a "weak 2-category".

In the rest of his thesis, Jeff will use this formalism to construct
some examples "extended TQFTs", which are roughly maps of weak 2-categories

Z: nCob_2 -> 2Vect

where 2Vect is the weak double category of "2-vector spaces".  He's
focusing on some extended TQFTs called the Dijkgraaf-Witten models,
coming from finite groups.

But, he's also thought about the case where the finite group is
replaced by the Lie group SU(2).  In this case we get something a
lot like an extended TQFT, but not quite, called the Ponzano-Regge
model.  In this case of 3d spacetime, this is a nice theory of
quantum gravity.  And, as I hinted back in "week232", we can let 2d
space in this model be a manifold with *boundary* by poking little
holes in space - and these holes wind up acting like particles!

So, we get a relation like this:

 (n-2)-dimensional manifolds                     MATTER

 (n-1)-dimensional manifolds with boundary       SPACE

  n-dimensional manifolds with corners           SPACETIME

which is really quite cool.

It would be fun to talk about this.  However, to understand Morton's
work more deeply, you need to understand a bit about "weak double
categories".  He explains them quite nicely, but I think I'll spend
the rest of this Week's Finds giving a less detailed introduction,
just to get you warmed up.

This chart should help:

                                   BIGONS                SQUARES

   LAWS HOLDING                    strict                strict
   AS EQUATIONS                 2-categories        double categories

   LAWS HOLDING                    weak                  weak
 UP TO ISOMORPHISM              2-categories        double categories

2-categories are good for describing how to glue together 2-dimensional
things that, at least in some abstract sense, are shaped like *bigons*.
A "bigon" is a disc with its boundary divided into two halves.  Here's
my feeble ASCCI rendition of a bigon:

                      f
                   --->---
                  /       \
                 /   ||    \
              X o    ||B    o Y
                 \   \/    /
                  \       /
                   --->---
                      g

The big arrow indicates that we think of the bigon B as "going from"
the top semicircle, f, to the bottom semicircle, g.  Similarly, we
think of the arcs f and g as going from the point X to the point Y.

Similarly, double categories are good for describing how to glue together
2-dimensional gadgets that are shaped like *squares*:

                      f
               X o---->----o X'
                 |         |
               g v    S    v g'
                 |         |
               Y o---->----o Y'
                      f'

Both 2-categories and double categories come in "strict" and "weak"
versions.  The strict versions have operations satisfying a bunch of
laws "on the nose", as equations.  In the weak versions, these laws
hold up to isomorphism whenever possible.

A few more details might help....

A 2-category has a set of objects, a set of morphisms f: X -> Y going
from any object X to to any object Y, and a set of 2-morphisms T: f => g
going from any morphism f: X -> Y to any morphism g: X -> Y.  We can
visualize the objects as dots:

                      o
                      X

the morphisms as arrows:

                      f
               X o---->----o Y

and the 2-morphisms as bigons:

                   f
                --->---
               /       \
              /   ||    \
           X o    ||B   o Y
              \   \/    /
               \       /
                --->---
                   g

We can compose morphisms like this:

               f         g                                    fg
          o---->----o---->----o             gives         o--->---o
          X         Y         Z                           X       Y

We can also compose 2-morphisms vertically:

                    f                                          f
                ---->----                                   --->---
               /  S      \                                 /       \
              /     g     \                               /         \
           X o ----->----- o Y              gives      X o     ST    o Y
              \   T       /                               \         /
               \         /                                 \       /
                ---->----                                   --->---
                    h                                          h

and horizontally:

                f           f'                              ff'
             --->---     --->---                          --->---
            /       \   /       \                        /       \
           /         \ /         \                      /         \
        X o     S     o     T     o Z       gives    X o    S.T    o Y
           \         / \         /                      \         /
            \       /   \       /                        \       /
             --->---     --->---                          --->---
                g           g'                              gg'


There are also a bunch of laws that need to hold.  I don't want to
list them; you can find them in Jeff's paper (also see "week80").
I just want to emphasize how a strict 2-category is different from
a weak one.

In a strict 2-category, the composition of morphisms is associative
on the nose:

(fg)h = f(gh)

and there are identity morphisms that satisfy these laws on the nose:

1f = f = f1

In a weak 2-category, these equations are replaced by 2-isomorphisms - that
is, invertible 2-morphisms.  And, these 2-isomorphisms need to satisfy new
equations of their own!

What about double categories?

Double categories are like 2-categories, but instead of bigons, we have
squares.

More precisely, a double category has a set of objects:

                   o
                   X

a set of horizontal arrows:

                   f
            X o---->----o X'

a set of vertical arrows:

            X o
              |
            g v
              |
            Y o

and a set of squares:

                   f
            X o---->----o X'
              |         |
            g v    S    v g'
              |         |
            Y o---->----o Y'
                   f'

We can compose the horizontal arrows like this:

               f         f'                                  f.f'
          o---->----o---->----o             gives         o--->---o
          X         Y         Z                           X       Y

We can compose the vertical arrows like this:

         X o
           |
         g v                                                  o
           |                                                  |
         Y o                                gives         gg' v
           |                                                  |
        g' v                                                  o
           |
         Y o

And, we can compose the squares both vertically:

                f
         X o---->----o X'
           |         |                                        f
         g v    S    v g'                              X o---->----o X'
           |         |                                   |         |
         Y o---->----o Y'                  gives     gh  v   SS'   v g'h'
           |         |                                   |         |
         h v    S'   v h'                              Z o---->----o Z'
           |         |                                        f'
         Z o---->----o Z'
                f'

and horizontally:

                f    Y    g                                 f.g
         X o---->----o---->----o Z                    X o---->----o Z
           |         |         |                        |         |
         h v    S    v    S'   v h'                   h v   S.S'  v h'
           |         |         |                        |         |
        X' o---->----o---->----o Z'                  X' o---->----o Z'
                f'   Y'   g'                               f'.g'


In a strict double category, both vertical and horizontal composition
of morphisms is associative on the nose:

(fg)h = f(gh)             (f.g).h = f.(g.h)

and there are identity morphisms for both vertical and horizontal
composition, which satisfy the usual identity laws on the nose.

In a weak double category, we want these laws to hold only up to
isomorphism.  But, it turns out that this requires us to introduce
bigons as well!  The reason is fascinating but too subtle to explain
here.  I didn't understand it until Jeff pointed it out.  But, it
turns out that Dominic Verity had already introduced the right concept
of weak double category - a gadget with both squares and bigons - in
*his* Ph.D. thesis a while back:

11) Dominic Verity, Enriched categories, internal categories, and
change of base, Ph.D. dissertation, University of Cambridge, 1992.

Interestingly, if you weaken *only* the laws for vertical composition,
you don't need to introduce bigons.  The resulting concept of
"horizontally weak double category" has been studied by Grandis and Pare:

12) Marco Grandis and Bob Pare, Limits in double categories, Cah.
Top. Geom. Diff. Cat. 40 (1999), 162-220.

Marco Grandis and Bob Pare, Adjoints for double categories, Cah.
Top. Geom. Diff. Cat. 45 (2004), 193-240.  Also available at
http://www.dima.unige.it/~grandis/rec.public_grandis.html

and more recently by Martin Hyland's student Richard Garner:

13) Richard Garner, Double clubs, available as math.CT/0606733

and Tom Fiore:

14) Thomas M. Fiore, Pseudo algebras and pseudo double categories,
available as math.CT./0608760.

At this point I should admit that the terminology in this whole
field is a bit of a mess.  I've made up simplified terminology
for the purposes of this article, but now I should explain how it
maps to the terminology most people use:

   ME                                  THEM

strict 2-category                   2-category
weak 2-category                     bicategory
strict double category              double category
weak double category                double bicategory
horizontally weak double category   pseudo double category

Verity used the term "double bicategory" to hint that his gadgets
have both squares and bigons, so they're like a blend of double
categories and bicategories.  It's a slightly unfortunate term, since
experts know that a double category is a category object in Cat, but
Verity's double bicategories are not bicategory objects in BiCat.
Morton mainly uses Verity's double bicategories - but in the proof of
his big theorem, he also uses bicategory objects in BiCat.

There's a lot more to say, but I'll stop here and let you read the
rest in Jeff's paper!

Dear collegues,

"Equitable Mathematics" was a translation of=20
"Math=E9matiques Equitables" in french.=20
I am not sure the translation is correct.
"Fair Mathematics" maybe better.

Mike Barr is raising up an important point.
We should look at the problem from an economical point of view.
The true buyers of scientific journals are the university librairies,
not the scientists. There is a demand for low-price-high-quality
scientific journals. The mathematical community is the producer.
The publisher is the intermediate. The prices are artificially high.
We may need an organisation of Equitable Mathematics.
The organisation should be supported financially by
the university librairies and the mathematical associations.

The editorial board of Topology has resigned to protest the
price of the journal. I admire their political gesture
but unfortunately, it has a drawback:
a prestigious journal has disappeared.
I have a crazy idea:
Topology could be resurrected as a cloned called Equitable Topology.
The new journal could have the same editorial board as late Topology,
if the editors agree.
Other expensive mathematical journals could be duplicated
with an Equitable clone having the same editorial board.

I am aware of the organisational difficulties of
realising the idea of Equitable Mathematics.
To be successful, it will have to be done very seriously.
It should be economically sound.
Maybe the mathematical associations should be involved
in the organisation.

Andre

I never heard of such an initiative or else I would have supported it and
volunteered to help. You may (or may not) recall that during many years I
sole-handedly edited the Reports of the Department of Mathematics and
Statistics, after Willie Moser stepped down from this job. It was a lot of
work for me, but I am afraid that it served little purpose. Had I known of
such an initiative (for a proper journal), I would have devoted my energy to
it rather than to the Reports. In the end it was the Department itself which
decided that there was no need for the Reports (and thus for me) any longer.

Just to set the record straight,
Marta

It appears that we have some stiff competition.  The NUMDAM project has
an impressive list of journals digitized:
http://archive.numdam.org/numdam-bin/browse
with some nice metadata available
http://www.numdam.org/en/infotech.php

Another snapshot is provided by
http://www.library.cornell.edu/math/digitalization.php
at Cornell.

As far as OCR of mathematics is concerned, my efforts with Google have
not yielded anything "new".  For reference these were interesting:
http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=3304
http://units.sla.org/division/dpam/pam-bulletin/vol31/no1/mathematics.html
http://www.inftyproject.org/en/
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&id=190438
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=628842 (and its references)
Even this large list
http://tev.itc.it/OCR/ResearchProjects.html
of research projects only mentions 1 that has to do with mathematics.

However, I have searched for sources of freely available TIFFs for
experimental purposes - and did not really find any.  While it might be
possible to get some from Cornell (see
http://historical.library.cornell.edu/math/help.html), this is not obvious.

I like the idea of publishing ourselves, but I don't like titles like Fair
(or Equitable) Topology.  You would have to ask a lawyer about this, but
in general book titles cannot be copyrighted and I would assume the same
is true of journals.  Certainly it would seem insane to allow anyone to
own a generic name like "Topology".  So, assuming it is allowed, why not
start a journal called just "Topology".

But another thing we can do is just support, in every possible way,
journals that are reasonably priced.  I have just had a paper accepted for
the journal Mathematica Japonica, published by the Japanese Math Soc.

I think one way that the whole scene went off the rails was the highly
specialized journals like J. Algebra, Topology, and so on.  They were and
are low-circulation (circulation numbers are trade secrets) and have come
to be very expensive.  JPAA was up to nearly $4000 for 2100 pages when
McGill stopped subscribing about ten or twelve years ago.  I don't know
what it is now, but I know they were losing subscribers steadily and may
be down to a couple hundred by now.  Of course, Elsevier is now primarily
in the business of selling universities their entire journal selection in
electronic form, so subscription numbers are meaningless.  But I do know
that most of McGill's journal budget is now going to these deals.  But
when, at some future date, McGill withdraws from this, not only do they
lose their access to future publications, but also past.  You are not
buying access, only renting it.  That is why I have copied all my papers
that are currently available onto my ftp site.

We need not only a McGill J., but also a UQAM J., a U de M J. and a
Concordia J.  Along with Toronto, York, UBC, ....  No one would represent
a great deal of work (start-up would involve less work than it did for
TAC, since we would make our experience available).

I can only hope that Elsevier's days on academic publishing are numbered,
along with all the rest of them.

An alternative way how libraries could support electronic publications
arises from the following thoughts.

What will or should be the role of libraries in the digital age?

Certainly, buying and storing hardcopies will play a smaller and smaller
role. So libraries should have an interest in finding something else to
do, just to survive as institutions themselves. What could that be?

I think university libraries could become publishers of electronic
journals. Universities should have an interest to host these journals,
because they provide prestige for little money.

As a conclusion, maybe the libraries could be convinced to DO the
`clerical support'.

The idea which Andre Joyal has put forward is certainly original, although
it may not be that practical or someone would have thought of it before?.
However, there may be a way to implement it and I am all for it.

I would extend the list to include, in additon to Topology, also Advances in
Mathematics, Annals of Pure and Applied Logic, and Journal of Pure and
Applied Algebra. Maybe others where some of us belong to the editorial
boards.

It so happens that the journals listed above are all published by
Reed-Elsevier. A few (foolish?) academics have pledged not to publish in
such journals for a different, and in my view, a much more serious, reason
-- namely, the involment with arms dealers.  The latter affects human lives,
whereas the former "just" makes it difficult to access scientific
informatin, particularly in Third World countries.

http://cage.ugent.be/~npg/elsevier/signatories.html

A similar pledge to target all highly-priced journals would make little
difference to some of us who have signed the above, but could mean
scientific suicide to others. In addition, we do (naively, perhaps) expect
to exert enough influence with this and other demarches going on right now
(such as a planned letter in the Times), so that we are relieved of the
pledge soon enough. If not, well.....there is always TAC and other
electronic journals listed in the excellent note by John Baez (which can
also be seen in the above website looking at comments by signataries).

Something must be done. That much is clear.

Marta

good morning

the "crazy" ides of joyal looks crazy, but ...

it is not imposible ...

the problem is that it will need a lot of people with different
qualifications involved and really working in its implementation

is that possible ... ?

as for the name, i think, "fair", or "equitable" have presisely a
connotation of fairness that is in itself a justification whose place
should not be in the title

i propose a neutral name as "alternative"


it would be really fun if all expensive journals "xx" are replaced by
unexpensive jounals "alternative xx" with the same editorial board ...

this would be an important subversive action



happy new year    eduardo dubuc

I would certainly agree, but in my brief discussions, they are little
interested in taking on new responsibilities.

I have just discovered that Mathematica Japonica charges page charges.
That is a retrograde step that I cannot advise.

You cannot copyright a title but you can protect a well known title from
infringement.

You can title your new book "My travels through the Pyrenees"  without
worrying whether someone else has already used the title.  But you
cannot title it "Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone."

Dear Marta,


I fully agree with your suggestion concerning the numerous journals that
you mentioned. Having a free on-line version of these journalist would
certainly be efficient in solving the problem of access to knowlwdge,
which is indeed very important. (My understanding is that the topic of
arms trade was closed on this mailing list!)

On the shorter run, however, I propose creating an off-shore website,
which is outside the reach of US/Canadian/European courts.  The declared
intent of this website would be to violate the copyright laws by
downloading the ready PDF files from ScienceDirect through the library
access that we have, and uploading it to this site -- which makes them
freely available for anyone interested. The idea would be to accept
anonymous uploads, and thus share the burden (and liablity) for
maintaining the site.

I think it would be much harder to fight the overpriced publishers if we
followed all the laws and rules. These laws were made to *maintain* and
*stabilize* the current situation, and not to help those who want a
change.

> Something must be done. That much is clear.

The problem is that profit is a very good organizer, while getting
volunteers is never easy. I would be quite interested in hearing the
history of TAC, how it started, etc.

One institution that hasn't been mentioned is conference proceedings.  I
don't know why but mathematics generally seems to take a more casual
approach to these than engineering.  Whereas mathematics conferences
tend to expect the talks to ripen into carefully refereed publications
afterwards, whether together in a proceedings or separately in various
journals, engineering conferences tend to insist on issuing a bound
proceedings with 4-10 pages per paper, leaving it up to the authors to
decide whether they want to submit a more polished version to a journal
later.  For both mathematics and engineering a conference may invite a
subset of the papers for a special issue of a suitable journal.

This difference is sensitive to the needs and circumstances of
publication.  Ostensibly the primary purpose of publication is
dissemination, with author kudos supposedly secondary.  Lately the
latter has been badly skewing the former, with conferences seemingly
worrying as much about appointments and promotions as about
dissemination.  This may well be a side effect of the web, whose search
engines support associative retrieval of polished articles and daily
blogs alike, solving the access problem without addressing the
evaluation problem.

This technological revolution is transforming the publication world
faster than universities, libraries, and publishers can follow in real
time.  Appointments and promotions have until recently been mired in the
tradition of relying on refereed journal publications in strong
preference to conference publications.  Libraries continue to follow the
taste of deans in preferring to archive journals over conference
proceedings, with the result that at least pre-web articles in
conference proceedings are inaccessible to the clients of many
libraries.  And publishers seem to have a certain inertia that makes
them slow to adapt their processes to the outgoing tide of publication
costs, an inertia that strands them on the rocks of their expensive old
methods.

This is all changing, slowly but inevitably.  Engineering deans are
becoming more willing to equate at least flagship conference
publications with journals.  Search engines are making libraries less
relevant for current material, while the ongoing digitization of older
material is starting to make basement stacks less relevant.  And
authors, editors, referees, and libraries are forcing the collective
hand of the publishers by avoiding the most expensive.

In this disruptive scenario the potential exists for conferences to
assume more of the role of journals.  The effect of journal refereeing
by itself is achieved for conferences with two mechanisms: refereeing
(supposedly quicker and less careful than for journals), and limited
capacity at the top---flagship conferences have acceptance rates of
20-40%, forcing the overflow into lesser conferences.  Whereas in the
past appointments and promotions were judged on the fact of journal
acceptance in combination with the assessment of their quality by peers
and seniors, these two criteria are now joined by a third: the quality
of the conferences that accepted the candidate's papers.  Historically
journal quality while a factor took a back seat to mere acceptance;
today it is made more important by the need to justify the supposedly
less careful refereeing and certainly hastier preparation of conference
papers.

If this trend towards attaching more importance to conference
publication is where we're all headed, it will happen in engineering
before it happens in mathematics for the simple reason that engineering
promotes conference publication more strenuously than does mathematics.

This would seem to involve  libraries in the business of system
administration.

The CUNY Graduate Center hosts a few online academic journals (e.g.,
http://ojs.gc.cuny.edu/   http://ojs.gc.cuny.edu/index.php/lljournal )
using the Open Journal Systems journal open source
management and publishing system ( URL:  http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs ).
The library here is not involved in either site administration, which
the IT department handles; or the management of the journals--the IT
department delegates this function to the journal editors.

Dear colleagues,

Recent discussions on this list seem to highlight two main ways in
which we may contrast the high costs of many scientific journals, as
well as some unethical connections of big publishing companies:

1. To support, and possibly develop, free electronic journals like
TAC and low-cost printed journals like Cahiers.
(Here, I would like to express my gratitude to persons like Bob
Rosebrugh, Michael Barr and Andree Ehresmann, which make this possible.)

2. To systematically send our preprints to an electronic archive, and
only submit them to journals which allow the permanence of such files
in these archives.

As to point 2, there seems to be a clear candidate, arXiv. (And of
course it would be good to have a "universal solution", where one
would easily find things.)

I have used of this possibility a few times.

Before deciding of doing so in a systematic way, I would like that
there be a clear statement of the policy of "arXiv" and clear
assumptions of responsibility by its organisers; statements which,
likely, the organisers and many of us take as understood and granted,
but which I have been unable to find on the net.

For instance, what about the possibility of the system being, in
future, exploited economically? What about the possibility of it
being sold to a commercial company - connected or not with strange
trades?

When downloading a preprint at arXiv, the author is asked to sign
(electronically) a sort of non-exclusive transfer of copyright. I
think we have a right to know that this transfer will not be used, in
future, for goals which would be in contrast with the present
(understood) ones, or even opposite to them.

Waiting for being able to extend my gratitude to the organisers of arXiv

Marco Grandis

If I correctly understand what is proposed for an "equitable" or
"fair" journal (as you prefer!), I think the "Cahiers de Topologie et
Geometrie Differentielle Categoriques" can be so classified.

Up to 1975 the "Cahiers" had some support from the CNRS. However for
the last 30 years we have published them (at a very cheap price),
without any financial nor clerical subvention, with only the revenue
of the subscriptions which (scarcely) pay for the printer and the
stamps. I do all the material work (preparation of the final version
of the volume for the printer, preparation of the envelopes and
sending of the volumes, registration of the subscriptions,...) without
any help. I even pay personally for the simple computer material
necessary to handle them (that explains why I need well prepared .pdf
files from the authors...).

Though the "Cahiers" seemed forgotten by the French establishment, I
have been pleasantly surprised to recently receive an offer from
NUMDAM to post them on the Internet (without any cost for me). In fact
the 7 first volumes are already posted under the heading "Seminaire
Ehresmann" (which was their initial title or sub-title); at the address
http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?j=SE&sl=0*

The following volumes should be numerized in 2007 (I have agreed with
the terms of the contract and should incessantly receive its final
version to sign). After that NUMDAM will post each volume 2 years
after its paper publication. I hope you'll help me by avoiding to
substantially decrease the number of subscriptions which are vital for
the journal's continuation.

With all my best wishes to all
Andree Ehresmann

Specifically, you use ~trademark~ law, rather than ~copyright~ law,
to do this.  So a practical question in the case of the name "Topology"
is whether Elsevier claims it as their trademark as a journal title.
(They don't have to mark it on the cover to do this, although it helps;
trademarks often aren't legally identified until the litigation begins.)
Note that such a meaningful and relevant (not arbitrary and fanciful) name
is harder to trademark at all, but history and recognition help.

A propos what Vaughan says, conferences in math are not seriously
refereed, often not refereed at all.  This makes conference proceedings
useless for promotions and also for research grants.  Like it or not, this
is one of the main reasons mathematicians tend to ignore conference
proceedings.  But CS conferences are generally carefully refereed with the
results Vaughan mentioned.

There are a number of reasons for this, I suppose but the overwhelming one
is how hard it is to get read a paper in math, with a concomitant
difficulty in getting serious refereeing.  I note that CS journals usually
want two and sometimes three referees to recommend a paper.  With rare
exceptions (Wiles, the Hales's paper on the Kepler conjecture, Perlman,
should he choose to publish) that is almost unheard of in math.  I was on
the committee that chose the papers for last summers conference in Nova
Scotia and only a couple papers were turned down and they were jokes.

How about a journal called J. Topology.  The owners of Topology cannot
object to that.

Yes, Cahiers is a good choice.  And while many thanks must go to Andree
for keeping it going all these many years, first we have to thank Charles
Ehresmann for starting it.

Dear Categorists -

The following claim should be well-known (or false),
but I don't know a reference:

Let Gpd be the 2-category consisting of

groupoids
functors
natural transformations

and let 1Type be the 2-category consisting of

homotopy 1-types
continuous maps
homotopy classes of homotopies

where for present purposes "homotopy 1-types" means "CW complexes with
vanishing higher homotopy groups regardless of the choice of basepoint".

Claim: Gpd and 1Type are equivalent (or "biequivalent",
in older terminology).

In fact I bet there is an explicit pseudo-adjunction between them,
with the "fundamental groupoid" 2-functor going one way and the
"Eilenberg-Mac Lane space" 2-functor going the other way.

Does anyone know for sure?  Know a reference?

Best,
jb

I have found that what mathematicians call a "conference" is similar to
what computer scientists usually call a "workshop" - almost everybody
who submits an on-topic abstract can talk, modulo basic sanity checks,
and sometimes on a first-come-first-served basis.

What computer scientists call a "conference" often involves fairly
careful refereeing (by multiple referees) and doesn't seem to exist in
mathematics. The refereeing is often to check for originality,
timeliness, and interest, rather than correctness.

What mathematicians call a "workshop" is often an affair where the
organizers invite their friends to give talks. Sometimes a few short
contributed talks may be accepted if there are empty slots, but
usually there is no (or only a token) public call for contributions.
This type of workshop also exists in computer science, although it is
less common. And some mathematics workshops follow the first pattern
above.

Dear Colleagues:

We would like to announce the following:

==============================================================
A Fields Institute Sponsored Workshop

Recent advances in category theory and logic:
Applications of traces to algebra, analysis and
categorical logic

University of Ottawa
April 28-30, 2007

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The abstract theory of traces has had a fundamental impact on a variety of
fields within mathematics. These range from functional analysis and
noncommutative geometry to topology and knot theory, and more recently to
logic and theoretical computer science. The theory of traced monoidal
categories, due to Joyal, Street and Verity, is an attempt to unify various
notions of trace that occur in these diverse branches of mathematics. More
recent developments include several theories of partial traces in monoidal
categories.

The Logic and Foundations of Computing Group at the University of Ottawa, with
funding from the Fields Institute, is proud to host a workshop to explore
these topics. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers in
these fields to look for common developments, models, and applications of
trace theory. Among the applications are various notions of parametrized
traces arising in operator algebras, in the theory of feedback and recursion
in theoretical computer science, in braid closure in knot theory, and in
dynamics of proofs as expressed by Linear Logic and the Geometry of
Interaction.

Some invited speakers include:

Samson Abramsky (Oxford)
Robin Cockett (Calgary)
Andre Joyal (UQAM)
Louis Kauffman (Illinois)
Mathias Neufang (Carleton)

We will be announcing further speakers shortly. This is intended to be a
workshop, with student participation in mind, including introductory lectures.
We will have some funding for student travel and accommodation. Students
interested in receiving financial aid should contact the organizers by January
30th.

Anyone interested in attending or contributing a talk should contact us by the
same date. There will soon be an official webpage.

We hope to see you there.

The organizers:

Phil Scott (phil@site.uottawa.ca)
Rick Blute (rblute@uottawa.ca)
Pieter Hofstra (hofstrap@cpsc.ucalgary.ca)

Hello,

We have the arxiv preprint server, and other preprint servers.  Why is
this not sufficient?  Because the papers are not refereed and subject to
being made better through the work of editors (not that they always
improve things).

What about having an editorial board, which would look at papers on the
arxiv, say, have them reviewed and revised, and then put them back on the
arxiv in final form, and listed elsewhere as having been through that
process and "blessed" so to speak by the editorial board?

What we would all like to have is more prestige for having our papers
blessed, and hopefully, read by somebody.  In this proposal, the quality
of the editorial board's work and the usability of its published listings
would be the most important thing.  They could even give a negative
recommendation for someone's paper, although authors might hope for the
opportunity to withdraw their paper if they didn't appreciate the final
recommendation.

The pulbished listings could include more information than just an up- or
down- recommendation to read the paper, it could include comments by other
mathematicians.

Bill Rowan

I guess reality will have to intervene.  Young people need refereed
journal publications if they hope to get tenure and promotion.  Canadians,
and doubtless others, require them in order to get research grants.  If
you are going through the process of refereeing them for ArXiv, you may as
well start a journal; it costs no more.  TAC is a good model and I am
about to find out about the NY J. Math. since I am a coauthor on a paper
that has no category theory in it.

I have probably published as many papers in TAC as anyone else and have so
far managed to convince NSERC that these are genuinely refereed papers.
I recently had a paper turned down for TAC, incidentally, so the
refereeing is real.  I had my doubts whether the paper was publishable and
now I am sure.  On ArXiv, there would have been no judgment.

However, I do not believe that this model of totally cost-free publication
is viable in the long run.  Since the universities will be the main
beneficiaries of the eventual demise (I hope) of the commercial journals,
they ought to be giving us the modest help we need.

This is what many journals do, after someone submits the paper.

For example, with Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics,
you submit a paper merely by sending them its arXiv number; when
it's accepted you prepare a version in their preferred format and this
gets put on the arXiv.

Other electronic journals, like Geometry and Topology or Algebraic and
Geometric Topology, require that you send them LaTeX in their preferred
format when you submit a paper.  If and when it's accepted, the final
version gets put on the arXiv.

It's a small extra expense for a journal to keep its papers on its
own server as well as the arXiv, so that practice will probably continue.

It would be a huge amount of work for someone to edit ALL papers
on the journal, so that won't happen - unless some billionaire decides
it's worth setting up a foundation to do this.

Best,
jb
