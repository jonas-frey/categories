The EPSRC grant `Coalgbraic Logic: Expanding the Scope' is a joint
project between Alexander Kurz (Leicester) and Achim Jung (Birmingham),
seeking to employ a Postdoc in Leicester and a PhD student in Birmingham.

The deadline to apply for the Postdoc position is 22 July 2009.

For more information see http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/akurz/clexp.html

The advert for the Postdoc position follows.

===

Applications are invited for a Research Associate to work with Dr.
Alexander Kurz (Leicester) and Prof. Achim Jung (Birmingham) on the
EPSRC-funded project `Coalgebraic Logic: Expanding the Scope'.

Coalgebraic Logic aims at a uniform theory of transition systems
(coalgebras) and their (typically modal) logics. Central notions are
bisimilarity, co-induction, and initial and final semantics. Coalgebraic
Logic is a young and quickly developing field closely related to areas
such as domain theory, modal logic, Stone duality in mathematics and to
program semantics, concurrency, process algebra in computer science.

The aim of the project is to expand the state of the art in Coalgebraic
Logic in 3 directions: (1) From modal logic to first-order logic; (2) to
study axiomatically defined classes of coalgebras; (3) explore the
relationship with domain theory and extend the expressiveness of logics
obtained via Domain Theory in Logical Form.

Applicants should have or be nearing completion of a PhD in an area
relevant to Coalgebraic Logic. This includes, for example, modal and
algebraic logic, domain theory, category theory, but also other aspects
of theoretical computer science, in particular those related to program
semantics and type theory. Applicants should have a proven track record
demonstrating ability to write, present and publish research results in
conferences and journals.

The closing date for this post is midnight on 22 July 2009.

Enquiries please email to Alexander Kurz.

Suppose I have a sequence of (topological) operads or monads

O \to P \to Q

such that `all'  corresponding representations in Top

X \to Y \to Z

are fibrations

is this enough to tell us

O \to P \to Q is a fibration?

To me the unadorned word "completion" connotes an idempotent operation,
which the free (co)completion of a category is not.  A more precise term
would be "free cocomplete category generated by."  Unlike most other uses
of "complete" in mathematics, completeness of a category is not a property
but a "property-like structure."

Dear Thomas,

I'm pretty sure that what Michael meant by "separable" was what
most topologists would call "second countable" -- i.e., countably
generated as a frame. (There are some topology textbooks in which
this condition is called "completely separable".)

I can indicate two important uses of non-free cocompletions, and more
precisely cocompletions for particular classes of diagrams preserving
some given colimits:

1. The construction of what, with Charles, we called the "prototype"
and the "type" associated to a sketch (in "Categories of sketchd
structures", Cahiers Top. et Geom. Diff. III-2, 1972)

2. The "complexification process" which, with Jean-Paul Vanbremeersch,
we use extensively in our model for hierarchical evolutionary systems
("Memory Evolutive Systems: Hierarchy, Emergence, Cognition", Elsevier
2007)

Kindly
Andree

Hi,

is there a coherence theorem for lax monoidal cats?

I have

	alpha : (A (x) B) (x) C -> A (x) (B (x) C)
	rho : A -> A (x) I
	lambda : I (x) A -> A

Do I need just the diagrams from MacLanes coherence theorem (suitably
modified)? Or do I need additional ones?

Cheers,
Thorsten

I'm studying the basics of Category Theory.  I appreciate help with my
questions!

My main interest is to "know everything and apply that knowledge
usefully".  I have a set of notes that reflect more than 25 years of
work on this:
http://www.worknets.org/wiki.cgi?LivingByTruth/Summary

Category theory may be relevant in describing an "algebra of views" and
the composition of views.  Consider a lost child who goes to where she
thinks her mother will look for her.  Such a child is taking up her view
of her mother's view of her view of her mother's view of her view.  In
this way, it is possible for two people to have a "good understanding"
even if they presently have no channel of communication.
http://www.worknets.org/wiki.cgi?LivingByTruth/LostChild

Has anybody ever studied an algebra of views or perspectives?

I'm studying from "Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists" by
Benjamin C. Pierce.

I'm interested to apply the mathematics from my Ph.D. thesis "Symmetric
Functions of the Eigenvalues of a Matrix" (UCSD, 1993).
http://www.worknets.org/upload/AndriusKulikauskas/AndriusKulikauskasThesis.pdf
I am wondering if it is possible to consider a category as an
"abstracted matrix" and take its trace or determinant, etc.

Symmetric functions are those functions such as X1 + X2 + X3 or X1*X2*X3
which stay the same even if you permute the variables.  They are
ubiquitous in algebraic combinatorics because objects are generally
built up with labels (which may at some point taken off) where the order
of the labels themselves generally shouldn't matter.  I studied
algebraic combinatorics as the "basement" of mathematics where objects
are constructed, and thus in some sense, foundational.  I was also
interested that the vector space of symmetric functions had several
"natural" bases, namely the power, elementary, homogeneous, monomial,
forgotten, Schur which I thought might reflect how humans look at things.
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SymmetricFunction.html

For my thesis, I noted that the trace and determinant of a matrix are
symmetric functions of its eigenvalues, namely the sum E1 + E2 + E3
+...  and the product E1*E2*E3...   We can calculate these and all
symmetric functions of eigenvalues straightforwardly in terms of the
edges of a matrix, which is interesting, because in general, we can't
calculate the eigenvalues themselves.  I gave combinatorial
interpretations of these functions in terms of walks, cycles, Lyndon
words, rimhook tableux, etc on a generic matrix A.  What's very
interesting is that if you set that generic matrix A to be a diagonal
matrix X (whose eigenvalues are necessarily the diagonal elements), then
the results collapse to yield the usual symmetric functions.  The matrix
A can be specialized in other ways as well.  Also, the symmetric
functions of the eigenvalues capture the combinatorics of all of the
theorems that I could find about generic matrices.

I am drawn to think of a category as a "generic matrix" from the
combinatorial point of view, if possible.  In such a view:
* the objects would be the dimensions of a square matrix A (and I allow
that the objects are unordered and perhaps uncountable, so that I speak
of an "abstracted matrix").
* each arrow F:X->Y would be a term in an (unordered, commutative) sum
that corresponds to Axy
* composition and associativity imply that each term in such a sum can
be written (perhaps in more than one way) as a path (composed of arrows)
starting at X and passing through perhaps several other nodes and
arriving at Y.
* an identity 1:X->X can be thought of as a term 1 in the series for the
diagonal cell Axx  (I suppose that the identity need not be unique? or
must it?)
* if there are no arrows from X to Y, then we write a 0 in the cell Axy

What I would then want to say is that the series Axy consists of terms
such that:
* some are distinct atoms F:X->Y
* the rest are generated by composition   F:X-> ... ... ... ->Y
* there is an equivalence relationship by which certain compositions are
equal, perhaps imagined to collapse

I suppose that this is alway possible in that, given X, Y, we can simply
take as our "atoms" the entire collection of arrows from X to Y.  Then
all compositions must collapse back into our atoms.  Indeed, there is a
partial order (by inclusion) of the sets of arrows that may be
understood as "the atoms".  In this partial order we may ask if there is
any set of arrows that is "natural", for example, depending on the
equivalence relationship, there may or not be a smallest set of atoms.
Perhaps this search for atoms might be analogous to what "representation
theory" does for groups.

This is a very "concrete" approach and when I wrote to Joseph Goguen
(who sadly passed away) about it, he didn't think that was a good way to
think about categories.  But I have in my thesis a powerful perspective
for dealing with a generic matrix.  And I think that an "abstracted
matrix" is metaphysically, conceptually about the most basic object that
math offers.

I suppose that my question is, Assuming a labeling for objects, What can
we say about the systems for labeling arrows (the ones that drop
parentheses, thanks to associativity)?

Once we have a system for labeling the arrows, then my thesis work
observes that various constructions accord with symmetric functions of
"eigenvalues" of the related matrix.  For example, the trace generates
the closed walks (from any X back to itself) that you can take within
the category.

The determinant of a category is the product of signed cycles.  The sign
is straightforward if there is an implicit order in the objects, and if
one does not exist for some of the objects, then we can simply leave
that unresolved.  Where the sign exists, then there can be some
collapsing.  Are there theorems in category theory where products of
signed cycles are generated?

Note that we may have two categories with the same objects (or we may
always extend the sets of objects and embed the categories).  Then
multiplication of matrices gives a composition of the categories.  We
can multiply (and compose) a matrix with itself.  (Indeed, a category
may be thought of as the matrix generated from its atoms Q by series
expansion matrix multiplication 1/(1-Q) ).  And the matrix/category A
may be thought as the paths accepted by an automata and Q as the basic
rules.

Has this "abstracted matrix" approach been taken?  I appreciate
suggestions on what to read and what to explore.

Thank you,

Dear List,

I have some questions on flat functors and Grothendieck topologies.
It is probably well-known that if F: C--> Set is a flat functor
on a small category then there is a Grothendieck topology on C
in which the covering sieves S on the object c consist of sets
of arrows to c such that {Fs|s in S} is jointly epimorphic on Fc.

1. Could you tell me a reference for this statement?

2. Is there a characterization of Grothendieck topologies that
arise in this way from a flat functor? (`flat topologies'?)

3. For what categories C will there be a flat functor inducing
the canonical topology on C?

Thank you for any help.

Kornel

There are situations where standard completion constructions are =
insufficient to accurately describe the relationship between two =
categories. The motivating example in the paper "Relative completions" =
(JPAA 192, 2004) was the presentation of the Effective topos as an exact =
completion of the category of partitioned assemblies. This presentation =
relies on the axiom of choice in Sets, and therefore does not work when =
we work over an arbitrary base topos. The solution is to define a =
relative version of the exact completion which preserves quotients of =
equivalence relations coming from the base topos. More precisely, it is =
defined by first freely adding all quotients, but then formally =
inverting the canonical comparison morphisms between the new quotients =
and the old ones from the base.

Best regards,
Pieter

I can indicate two important uses of non-free cocompletions, and more
precisely cocompletions for particular classes of diagrams preserving
some given colimits:

1. The construction of what, with Charles, we called the "prototype"
and the "type" associated to a sketch (in "Categories of sketchd
structures", Cahiers Top. et Geom. Diff. III-2, 1972)

2. The "complexification process" which, with Jean-Paul Vanbremeersch,
we use extensively in our model for hierarchical evolutionary systems
("Memory Evolutive Systems: Hierarchy, Emergence, Cognition", Elsevier
2007)

Michael Shulman wrote:

The presheaf category [C^op,Set] is a co-completion of C. Its full
subcategory of limit-preserving functors is another co-completion of
C. Both are "free", but with respect to a different criterion: the
Yoneda embedding into the first one does not preserve existing
colimits, whereas into the second one it does.

In particular, the second operation is idempotent (up to equivalence
of categories) if C is already co-complete (this also follows from the
adjoint functor theorem). It would therefore qualify as a "completion"
in the sense that Mike Shulman mentioned.

Any co-complete category between these two extremes is presumably also
a (non-free) co-completion.

Folk,

Several errors and omissions in the description
of Category 2 have been corrected.

http://carnot.yi.org/Category2.xhtml

Firefox and Iceweasel can display it correctly.
Other browsers have problems.  On one MS-Win*
system, the upper half brackets are absent.
Most likely a font problem.  Chrome mislocates
lines or arrowheads or both and fails to apply
some of the text in the SVG.

I'm interested in any further criticisms and
suggestions.

Thanks,               ... Peter E.

Here's one way to look at it. A flat functor F: C --> Set corresponds to
a point p of the presheaf topos [C^op,Set]. Given a Grothendieck
topology J, p factors through the sheaf topos Sh(C,J) iff F carries
J-covering sieves to epimorphic families. Thus the particular J you
define is the largest for which p factors through Sh(C,J); equivalently,
Sh(C,J) is the image (in the surjection--inclusion sense) of the
geometric morphism p: Set --> [C^op,Set]. Hence a topos has a
presentation of this kind iff it admits a surjective geometric morphism
from Set; equivalently, iff it is (equivalent to) the category of
coalgebras for a finite-limit-preserving accessible comonad on Set.

OVERVIEW OF FAST

The sixth International Workshop on Formal Aspects of Security
and Trust (FAST2009) aims at continuing the successful efforts
of the previous FAST workshops, fostering cooperation among
researchers in the areas of security and trust.

Computing and network infrastructures have become pervasive, and
now they carry a great deal of economic activity.  Thus, society
needs well matching security and trust mechanisms.  Interactions
increasingly span several enterprises and involve loosely
structured communities of individuals.  Participants in these
activities must control interactions with their partners based
on trust policies and business logic.  Trust-based decisions
effectively determine the security goals for shared information
and for access to sensitive or valuable resources.

FAST focuses on the formal models of security and trust that are
needed to state goals and policies for these interactions.  We also
seek new and innovative techniques for establishing consequences of
these formal models.  Implementation approaches for such techniques
are also welcome.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

	*** http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fast2009 ***

We seek papers presenting original contributions. Two types of
submissions are possible:

(1) short papers, up to 5 pages in LNCS format,
(2) full papers, up to 15 pages in LNCS format.

Submissions should clearly state their category (1 or
2). Author's full name, address, and e-mail must appear on the
first page.

Accepted full papers will be published in the formal
post-proceedings in LNCS.

Short papers as well as full papers will be included in the
informal proceedings distributed at the workshop.  After the
workshop, authors of short papers which are judged mature enough
for publication will be invited to submit full papers. These
will be reviewed according to the usual refereeing procedures,
and accepted papers will be published in the post-proceedings in
LNCS.

Simultaneous submission of full papers to a journal or
conference/workshop with formal proceedings justifies rejection.
Short papers at FAST are not formally published, so this
restriction does not apply to them.  However, related
publications and overlapping submissions must be cited
explicitly in short papers.

                    FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

              10th International Conference on
             Mathematics of Program Construction
                          MPC 2010

            Qu=E9bec City, Canada, 21-23 June 2010

             http://mpc-amast2010.fsg.ulaval.ca/

          Colocated with AMAST 2010 (23-26 June 2010)



BACKGROUND

The biennial MPC conferences aim to promote the development of
mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical
and effective in the process of constructing computer programs. Topics
of interest range from algorithmics to support for program
construction in programming languages and systems.

The previous conferences were held in Twente, The Netherlands (1989),
Oxford, UK (1992), Kloster Irsee, Germany (1995), Marstrand, Sweden
(1998), Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000), Dagstuhl, Germany (2002),
Stirling, UK (2004, colocated with AMAST '04), Kuressaare, Estonia
(2006, colocated with AMAST '06) and Marseille, France (2008).
The 2010 conference will be held in Lac-Beauport, a suburb of Qu=E9bec
City, Canada, and will be colocated with AMAST '10 (23-26 June 2010).



INVITED SPEAKERS

Roland Backhouse, University of Nottingham, UK.
Others to be announced later.



IMPORTANT DATES

   * Submission of abstracts: 7 December 2009
   * Submission of full papers: 14 December 2009
   * Notification of authors: 20 February 2010
   * Camera-ready version: 20 March 2010



TOPICS

Papers are solicited on mathematical methods and tools put to use in
program construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to
support for program construction in programming languages and
systems. Some typical areas are type systems, program analysis and
transformation, programming-language semantics, security and program
logics. Theoretical contributions are welcome provided their relevance
for program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome
provided their mathematical basis is evident.



SUBMISSION

Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text, 10 to 20 lines)
must be submitted by 7 December 2009. Full papers (pdf) adhering to
the LaTeX llncs style must be submitted by 14 December 2009. There
is no official page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.
The web-based system EasyChair will be used for submission
(https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=3Dmpc2010).

Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted
concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. In
particular, they must not be submitted to AMAST 2010. Accepted
papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.

The proceedings of MPC'10 will be published in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series of Springer-Verlag.

After the conference, the authors of the best papers will be invited
to submit revised versions to a special issue of the Science of
Computer Programming journal of Elsevier.

At http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem a "fundamental
theorem" in a field of mathematics is defined to be "a theorem [or
lemma] considered central to that field." The designation
"fundamental" is often a matter of tradition, belonging to the
history or sociology of mathematics.

Some results, for example Hilbert's Nullstellensatz in algebraic
geometry, are fundamental yet not generally designated "fundamental,"
although at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_category_theory_and_related_mathematics
it is indeed called that, along with a number of other results not
called "fundamental" elsewhere.

At http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fundamental_theorems there
are links to articles on fundamental theorems of finitely generated
abelian group, algebra, arithmetic, calculus, calculus of variations,
combinatorial enumeration, curves, cyclic groups, Galois theory,
homomorphisms, and linear algebra.

To these can be added three "fundamental theorems of functional
analysis" (Hahn-Banach, Open Mapping, Uniform Boundedness), the
"fundamental theorem of Lie groups," and even a "fundamental theorem
of fractal geometry" (Iterated Function System Convergence).

Some of these results have been or can be revealingly stated if not
yet proved in category theory terms (finitely generated abelian
group, Galois theory, homomorphisms,...). My question is, what if any
are the obstructions to extending this virtue to all of the so-called
fundamental theorems?

Hi all

Note my new e-mail. I had to get a new e-mail to exclude html.

I am not an expert on oo-categories but i am sure there is a structure to
the "class" of all omega-categories. I hope all this will not depend on the
definition of an oo-category.

6>
Is the "class" of oo-categories of a certain recursive depth
always an oo-category of depth one higher than the previous depth?
I think yes for both strict and weak oo-categories.

What should the "class" of all n-categories in Makkais foundation be called
to describe it technically accurately?
An oo-cosmos? in the categorical sense of a cosmos.
I am not sure but this "class" maby also contain all oo-categories.

Are there different strict/weak n-categories with n any infinite
ordinal number omega?
omega does remind of an ordinal number.
The category need not to be accessible by forming categories of categories,
just satisfy some axioms of an strict/weak oo-category for oo=omega.
There might be a better definition of an omega-category if it is
necessary at all, i don't know.

Best regards
Rafael Borowiecki

Given any notion of higher category, usually considerable interesting
information is already encoded in the collection of all of these

 - with all suitable morphisms between them

 - and with all suitable invertible transformations and invertible
higher transformations between these.

Notably this is sufficient to talk about equivalence of the higher
categories in question.

In other words, given any notion of higher category, their collection
should at least form an (oo,1)-category.

  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%28infinity%2C1%29-category

This should be the truncation of a more general structure, but should
already contain a considerable amount of the relevant information and
structure.

For various flavors of higher categories the corresponding
(oo,1)-categories "of all of them" are well known. These are
"presented" by what is known as "folk model structures":

 http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/folk+model+structure .

More generally and more recently, Jacob Lurie has used unpublished
work by Clark Barwick to define and study (oo,1)-categories of
collections of (infty,n)-categories for n in N

  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/(infinity,n)-category


>  Are there different strict/weak n-categories with n any infinite
>  ordinal number omega?
>  omega does remind of an ordinal number.

One should beware that in practice the difference between the usage
"oo-category" and "omega-category" is usually more due to tradition
than being of intrinsic meaning. Ross Street originally introduced
"omega-category" to explicitly denote a notion where cells of
non-finite degree exist, but later authors didn't stick to that use of
the work.

Compare the remark by Sjoerd Crans that is reproduced here:

 http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/strict+omega-category

			   Call For Papers

     Programming Languages meets Program Verification (PLPV) 2010

		  http://slang.soe.ucsc.edu/plpv10/

		      Tuesday, January 19, 2010
			    Madrid, Spain
		      Affiliated with POPL 2010


Overview: The goal of PLPV is to foster and stimulate research at the
intersection of programming languages and program verification. Work
in this area typically attempts to reduce the burden of program
verification by taking advantage of particular semantic and/or
structural properties of the programming language. One example is
dependently typed programming languages, which leverage a language's
type system to specify and check richer than usual specifications,
possibly with programmer-provided proof terms. Another example is
extended static checking systems like Spec#, which extends C# with
pre- and postconditions along with a static verifier for these
contracts.

We invite submissions on all aspects, both theoretical and practical,
of the integration of programming language and program verification
technology. To encourage cross-pollination between different
communities, we seek a broad the scope for PLPV.  In particular,
submissions may have diverse foundations for verification (type-based,
Hoare-logic-based, etc), target diverse kinds of programming languages
(functional, imperative, object-oriented, etc), and apply to diverse
kinds of program properties (data structure invariants, security
properties, temporal protocols, etc).

Submissions: Submissions should fall into one of the following three
categories:

   1. Regular research papers that describe new work on the above or
      related topics. Submissions in this category have an upper limit
      of 12 pages, but shorter submissions are also encouraged.

   2. Work-in-progress reports should describe new work that is
      ongoing and may not be fully completed or evaluated. Submissions
      in this category should be at most 6 pages in total length.

   3. Proposals for challenge problems which the author believes is
      are useful benchmarks or important domains for language-based
      program verification techniques.  Submissions in this category
      should be at most 6 pages in total length.

Submissions should be prepared with SIGPLAN two-column conference
format. Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN republication
policy. Concurrent submissions to other workshops, conferences,
journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed.

Publication: Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and appear
in the ACM digital library.

Student Attendees: Students with accepted papers or posters are
encouraged to apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant that will help to cover
travel expenses to PLPV. Details on the PAC program and the
application can be found on the workshop web page. PAC also offers
support for companion travel.

Important Dates:

    * Electronic submission: October 8, 2009, 11:59pm Samoa time (UTC-11)
    * Notification: November 8, 2009

Dear categorists,

I am trying to wrap my mind around the concept of an (internal)
chain-complete poset in a sheaf topos. I am failing to come up with an
example of a poset that is chain-complete but is not complete. The
precise definitions of "chain-complete" in the internal language are
as follows.

Suppose (P, <=) is a poset in a topos. For C in Omega^P, let chain(C)
be the statement

  forall x, y : P, (x in C and y in C) ==> (x <= y or y <= x)

Then P is chain-complete if

  forall C : Omega^P, chain(C) ==> exists x : P, x is the supremum of C

where "x is the supremum of C" means the usual thing.

So what does a chain-complete poset which isn't complete look like?

Since I am used to arguing intuitionistically, it would help a lot if
there were some (possibly infinitary) logical principle or schema that
is typical of sheaf toposes -- something expressing the local nature
of validity. Such a principle ought to be invalid in realizability
toposes, so perhaps it should express or imply cocompleteness (with
respect to Set). But would that be of any help for arguing in the
internal language?

With kind regards,

Andrej Bauer

Take the product of any nonempty discrete poset X with the ordinal 2.
Give Xx2 the "product order" ((x, a) </=3D (y, b) iff x=3Dy and a </=3D b=
).
The only non-singleton nonempty chains are the subsets {x} x 2 .
Clearly each of these is complete, Xx2 is chain-complete, and yet
Xx2 is not at all complete -- not even a semilattice either way.

HTH. Cheers, -- Fred

Dear categorists,

I should have asked a different question: what does a chain-complete
_lattice_ which is not complete look like in a sheaf topos? Is there
such a thing?

(Thanks to Fred Linton who pointed out that I could just take a flat
order and multiply it with a complete one, thus gettting a poset which
has very few interesting chains but is not at all complete.)

With kind regards,

Andrej

Dear Andrej, when you say "complete" but not "chain-complete", do you
mean "directed complete"?

Here is (I think) an example that is also natural and relevant.

Do you know Andy Pitts' work (with others) on Nominal Sets? The
category of nominal sets is a sheaf topos (the "Schanuel topos", it
is actually Boolean). Andy has done some domain theory in nominal
sets to model a language with dynamic allocation of fresh names,
FreshML.

Fixing an infinite set of "atoms" A, then the category of nominal
sets is a subcategory of the category of actions of the symmetric
group on A (see reference for full definition). The set of atoms has
itself a natural group action. The finite powerset of the nominal set
of atoms, ordered by inclusion, is chain complete, but not directed
complete. Any chain of finite sets can only have finite support, and
is thus necessarily finite. But the full finite powerset is itself
directed, without an upper bound.

I hope that is of some help. Best regards, Sam.

Shinwell and A. M. Pitts, Theoretical Computer Science 342, 2005.
Available from Andy Pitts' web page. NB "nominal sets" are there
called "FM-sets".

The example I mention appears in Mark Shinwell's PhD thesis, The
Fresh Approach: functional programming with names and binders. http://

                        Call for Participation

        6th Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science, FICS 2009
                Coimbra, Portugal, 12-13 September 2009,
                    a satellite workshop of CSL 2009,
                  colocated with PPDP 2009, LOPSTR 2009


                        http://cs.ioc.ee/fics09/

Background

Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer
science and logic by justifying induction and recursive
definitions. The construction and properties of fixed points have been
investigated in many different frameworks such as: design and
implementation of programming languages, program logics,
databases. The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for
researchers to present their results to those members of the computer
science and logic communities who study or apply the theory of fixed
points. Previous workshops where held in Brno (1998, MFCS/CSL
workshop), Paris (2000, LC workshop), Florence (2001, PLI workshop),
Copenhagen (2002, LICS (FLoC) workshop), Warsaw (2003, ETAPS workshop).

Topics for the call for papers included, but were not restricted to:

    * categorical, metric and ordered fixed point models
    * fixed points in algebra and coalgebra
    * fixed points in languages and automata
    * fixed points in programming language semantics
    * the mu-calculus and fixed points in modal logic
    * fixed points in process algebras and process calculi
    * fixed points in the lambda-calculus, =

         functional programming and type theory
    * fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits
    * fixed points in logic programming and theorem proving
    * finite model theory, descriptive complexity theory, =

         fixed points in databases

The paper "Clone Theory and Algebraic Logic"

is available at

http://www.algebraic.net/ctal

The concept of a clone is central to many branches of mathematics, such as universal algebra, algebraic logic, and lambda calculus. Abstractly a clone is a category with two objects such that one is a countably infinite power of the other. Left and right algebras over a clone are covariant and contravariant functors from the category to that of sets respectively. In this paper we show that first-order logic can be studied effectively using the notions of right and left algebras over a clone. It is easy to translate the classical treatment of logic into our setting and prove all the fundamental theorems of first-order theory algebraically.

I would like to call your attention to three relatively new items on my
ftp site, all joint with John Kennison and Bob Raphael: Local extension of
maps, Isbell duality, Isbell duality for modules.  To see them, simply
browse to ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr/pdffiles and click on Index.html.

Dear all,
I would like to announce this recent preprint of mine:

http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.5143


Title: Categories without structures


Abstract: The popular view according to which Category theory provides a =
support
for Mathematical Structuralism is erroneous. Category-theoretic foundatio=
ns of
mathematics require a different philosophy of mathematics. While structur=
al
mathematics studies "invariant forms" (Awodey) categorical mathematics st=
udies
covariant transformations which, generally, don't have any invariants. In=
 this
paper I develop a non-structuralist interpretation of categorical mathema=
tics
and show its consequences for history of mathematics and mathematics educ=
ation.
