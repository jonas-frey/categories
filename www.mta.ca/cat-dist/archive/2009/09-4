A question just came up at the Midland Graduate School (actually in
the functional programming lecture):
Where does the word monad come from?

I know that a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, but
what is the logic monoid => monad?

Btw, I frequently encounter monads in a categories of functors which
are not endofunctors. An example are finite dimensional vectorspaces
which can be constructed via a monoid in the category of functors
FinSet -> Set, here I is the embedding and (x) can be constructed from
the left kan extension and composition.
The unit is given by the Kronecker delta and join can be constructed
from Matrix multiplication. Should one call these beasts monads as
well? Is there a good reference for this type of construction?

Cheers,
Thorsten

I have told this story many times, but I guess one more can't hurt.  Of
course, it was originally used by Leibniz to describe the set of
infintesimals surrounding an ordinary point.

In the summer (or maybe late spring, the Oberwohlfach records will show
this) of 1966, there was a category meeting there.  It was, as far as I
know, the third meeting ever devoted to categories.  The first was the
first Midwest Category meeting, an invitation affair that consisted of
five people from Urbana (Jon Beck, John Gray, Alex Heller, Max Kelly, and
me), John Isbell and Fred Linton visiting Chicago that year, and a couple
people from U. Chicago, Mac Lane who was the host and arranged to pay our
expenses, Dick Swan, and maybe a couple others.  The second was in La
Jolla and this was the third.  The attendance consisted of practically
everyone in the world who had any interest in categories, with the notable
exception of Charles Ehresmann.

What, with one exception, most categorists call monads had by that time
been called "Standard constructions", "fundamental constructions" (in a
little-known paper by Jean-Marie Maranda pointed out to me by Peter
Huber), and, of course, "Triples".  The latter was created by
Eilenberg-Moore and I once asked Sammy (who was known to agonize over good
terminology--e.g. "Exact") why.  He answered that the concept seemed to be
of little importance, so he and John Moore spent no time on it!  So much
for the predictive ability of a great mathematician.

At any rate, the big unanswered question of the meeting, where the
importance of the concept was becoming clear (Jon and I had proved our
Acyclic models theorem, for example, and the fact of the triplebleness of
compact Hausdorff  spaces over sets, along with many mor familiar
examples), the search was on for a better name.  We tried many ideas (mine
was "Standard Natural Algebraic Functor with Unit" (try the acronym).  One
day at lunch or dinner I happened to be sitting next to Jean Benabou and
he turned to me and said something like "How about `monad'?"  I thought
about and said it sounded pretty good to me.  (Yes, I did.)  So Jean
proposed it to the general audience and there was general agreement.  It
suggested "monoid" of course and it is a monoid in a functor category.
The one dissenter was Jon Beck, who had invested as much into studying
them as anyone.  His argument was that while "triples" was not a good
name, "monad" wasn't either and we shouldn't change the name from a poor
one to a mediocre one, but instead continue to search for a better one.

Out of solidarity with Jon (we collaborated on several papers), I
continued to use "triple".  SLN 80 was (and is) known as the "Zurich
Triples Book".  By 1980, Jon was no longer doing serious mathematics and I
was ready to change.  Except that the book title "Toposes, Triples and
Theories" was too attactive to let go of.  Try "Toposes, Monads and
Theories".

Incidentally, Peter May also claims to have invented the term.  Treat that
claim with the contempt it deserves.  The most charitable explanation I
have is that he heard it from Mac Lane, forgot that he had and then came
up with it later.

as a replacement for triple.
The terminology was intended to match with "operad".
At the time, S. Mac Lane has taken up that suggestion.
In his book "Categories for the working mathematician"
Mac Lane uses the terminology monad and comonad rather than triple
and cotriple.

If Peter May participates in this board I am sure he will react.

The philosopher Gottfried Leibniz believed that every entity in the
Universe is a separate substance that doesn't interact with others. He
called these substances "monads". All properties and events that happen
to a monad are implicit in its nature from its creation. So if an apple
falls from a tree and bounces off my head, there is actually no contact:
the apple-monad bounces by itself without the help of my head and the
Venanzio-monad feels pain without the intervention of the apple. All
monads are synchronized from creation by the wisdom of God.
  This implies that every monad has an internal representation of every
entity in the universe and these representations can never influence
objects outside the monad.
  The analogy with our monads should be evident!

Cher Thorsten,

toutes mes excuses pour ce message en fran=E7ais.

Le terme "monade" a =E9t=E9 employ=E9 par Benabou (LNM Springer no 47, si je=
 =20
ne me trompe) et dans un sens abstrait : pseudofoncteur 1 --> B de la =20
bicat=E9gorie finale 1 vers une bicat=E9gorie arbitraire B. Par la suite =20
il a =E9t=E9 convenu de le r=E9sever au cas particulier o=F9 B=3DCat (en =20
remplacement du terme "triple").

A mon avis, le terme est remarquable car il combine ceux de "monoides" =20
et de "monades", concept utilis=E9 par Leibnitz, mais qui, ind=E9pendement =
=20
de l'usage fait par ce philosophe, signifie : unit=E9 simple, =20
ind=E9composable. Cette simplicit=E9, cette ind=E9composabilit=E9 est celle =
de =20
la bicat=E9gorie 1.

Aujourd'hui, on appelle monoide, les monades au sens g=E9n=E9ral de =20
Benabou. (Personnellement, je ne trouve cela imparfait car un vrai =20
monoide est une structure beaucoup plus riche : exemple x |--> x^2 n'a =20
pas de sens en general.)

amiti=E9s,

Michael, where on earth did that piece of contemptible writing
come from.  I never claimed to invent the term monad.  I did
invent the term operad, as a portmanteau of operation and monad.
And I convinced MacLane to change from the silly term `triple'
to `monad' in Categories for the working mathematician.  He is
not here to corroborate, but look at his note on terminology,
page 138 of the second edition: ``The frequent but unfortunate
use of the word `triple' in this sense has achieved a maximum
of needless confusion, what with the conflict with ordered
triple, plus the use of associated terms such as ``triple
derived functor''for functors which are not three times
derived from anything in the world.  Hence the term monad.''

Michael, shame on you!

Peter May

Whereas my recollection (from those dear dim days beyond recall when I
was present on a weekly basis for ND about that time)
was that the terminology went from Mac Lane to May with
operad to match monad

as I recall, Mac Lane liked monad because of the philosophical connection
Leibniz as philosopher not as mathematician?

    * Monad (Greek philosophy) a term used by ancient philosophers
Pythagoras, Parmenides, Xenophanes, Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus as a
term for God or the first being, or the totality of all being.
    * Monism, the concept of "one essence" in the metaphysical and
theological theory
    * Monad (Gnosticism), the most primal aspect of God in Gnosticism
    ****** Monadology, a book of philosophy by Gottfried Leibniz in
which monads are a basic unit of perceptual reality
    * Monadologia Physica by Immanuel Kant
    * The Cup or Monad, a text in the Corpus Hermetica
from the Wiki

Dear All,

As usual, there have been plenty of people with comments about history.

There was also a second part to the question:

>

> are not endofunctors. An example are finite dimensional vectorspaces

The category of functors from FinSet to Set is equivalent to the category
of endofunctors of Set which preserve filtered colimits: such endofunctors
are usually called finitary. Thus a monoid in [FinSet,Set] with respect to
this tensor product is the same thing as a monad on Set whose endofunctor
part is finitary: this is called a finitary monad.

These finitary monads on Set are equivalent to Lawvere theories and so in
turn to (finitary, single-sorted) varieties.

Finitary monads can also be considered on other base categories than Set,
especially on locally finitely presentable ones.

It is true that vector spaces are the algebras for a finitary monad on Set.
There is no need to restrict to finite-dimensional vector spaces; in fact it
is not true that there is a monad on Set whose algebras are the
finite-dimensional vector spaces.

Steve.

Some people may reserve monad for the case B=3DCat, but not all. After Benabo=

demonstrated the incredible importance of this idea in various B, the theor=

of monads in 2-categories/bicategories has been widely developed, starting
(I believe) with Ross Street's "Formal theory of monads".

I hope I can add some jigsaw pieces towards the history of the term
"monad" in category theory without offending anyone.

1) It is clearly a fact that the term "monad" is used in Benabou's
paper SLNM 47 (1967). He recognized that it is a morphism of
bicategories from the terminal category 1.

2) I have a clear memory that Mac Lane told me (perhaps at Chicago
while I was a postdoc at Champaign-Urbana 1968-69) that Benabou
courteously asked him (possibly by airmail, maybe by phone call,
maybe at a conference) whether Mac Lane would mind whether he used
the term "bicategory" in the sense we now use it. Mac Lane had used
"bicategory" to mean a category with two distinguished classes of
morphisms: roughly speaking, what we now call a category with a
factorization system. Mac Lane told Benabou he did not mind. So
Benabou used it in SLNM 47.

3) Less clearly I remember Mac Lane said Benabou also suggested the
term "monad" for use in SLNM 47.

4) It is again my clear memory that, in his lecture marathon at the
Summer School on Category Theory at Bowdoin College (Maine,
mid-1969), Mac Lane expressed strong dislike for the term "triple"
but had not really settled on a term. Mac Lane actually used the term
"triad" in his lectures at Bowdoin.

5) At CT08, Lawvere told me Eilenberg suggested the term "monad".

Best wishes,
Ross

"Operads" are like sets of operations.

A monad is an extension of a functor. If the functor is the term functor,
then the operations of the signature lies inside the functor, and the
"operations" eta and mu are identities, or at least something very
isomorphic to identities.

In the filter functor eta is point filters and mu is Kowalsky's
diagonalization.

In my view there is no logic monoid => monad, and I cannot see the
full idea behind using "operads", so help me Mona.

[Note from moderator: this thread has strayed; although this post is
allowed, comments closer to categories (not Kant's) are preferred.]

Reference to Leibniz is nice, and so is going back even more in history.=20
Going forward into modern history leads to problems of who actually cause=
d=20
what. Probably because we then tend to mix history and politics.

Anyway, also having googled, I found this about Leibniz:

=A7. 1. Die Monaden (Das Worte Monade oder Monas) wovon wir allhier reden=
=20
werden / sind nichts anders als einfache Substanzen / woraus die zusammen=
=20
gesetzten Dinge oder composita bestehen. Unter dem Wort / einfach /=20
verstehet man dasjenige / welches keine Teile hat.

"sind nichts anders als einfache Substanzen"
"is nothing but simple substances"
They are, but it is not a mathematical statement.

"woraus die zusammen gesetzten Dinge oder composita bestehen"
"using which you put them together or compose(!) them together"
Now he is cooking. Monad compositions are important. Leibniz and Beck=20
working together, I like it. This is closer to mathematics.

"verstehet man dasjenige / welches keine Teile hat"
"is to be understood as something which doesn't have subparts"
I am sure there are non-trivial monads which are not composed (in Beck's=20
sense) by other non-trivial monads. But more interestingely, composed=20
monads are indeed monads, and even worse (from leibniz point of=20
view) submonads do exist, like the filter monad being submonad to the=20
ultrafilter monad (with the astonishing fact, yes, I know, I am repreatin=
g=20
myself, that their respective algebras are Scott lattices and compact=20
Hausdorff spaces).

So, basically I like Leibniz, even if he was wrong at this point. History=
=20
is not easy. We say "Rome was destroyed" and we frequently say by the=20
goths. Saying that leads us to ask "how could it be destroyed". Seldom do=
=20
we hear "how could it stay alive so long".

Best,

Patrik

PS "Monas" seems mostly to be used for a sailing boat, the "Kiel", and=20
"the Mona" is Louvre in Paris.

Sorry if this offended you, but I heard from several places that you
claimed the invention of the term.  You will note that one other
respondent credited it to you, so there must have been a meme to that
effect.  If you never made that claim then I truly apologize.  Perhaps
people confused "monad" with "operad", which I do believe you invented.

Michael

We can generalize the concept of monoid from Set to any monoidal category

Indeed, most people seem to call a "monoid" in a bicategory a "monad".

John, given the didactic nature of this thread, I think we should be
more precise about what you mean by `a "monoid" in a bicategory'. For
a bicategory B and an object X therein, B(X,X) (together with composition,
1_X, and the inherited constraints of B)  i s  a monoidal category and a
monad in B is an object X in B together with a monoid in B(X,X).

In one paragraph, a monad can be understood as a set T of operations
graded by their arity X, that is, a variable set T(X) where the set X is
the parameter of variation.  This set is made a monoid by the operation
of substitution interpreted as the multiplication of the monoid.
Substitution is associative (terms of height three can be built top-down
or bottom-up) and has a two-sided identity interpretable ambiguously as
the identity operation of T (when applied to the top of a term) and
substitution of variables for themselves (when applied to the bottom of
a term).

The back-to-back talks of Walter Taylor on his general theory of
varieties and Fred Linton on monads at the Universal Algebra and
Category Theory (UACT) meeting held at MSRI in 1993 were like ships
passing in the night.  No one thought to mention, either before, during,
or after the talks, that they were describing essentially the same thing
(or if they did both George McNulty and I missed it), with the result
that many of the algebraists at the meeting just assumed that these were
unrelated talks.

Monads can be explained in terms of their associated Kleisli category,
or their Eilenberg-Moore category, or as the composition UF of any
set-valued functor U with its left adjoint.  After Fred's talk I had
lunch with George and tried out the third of these on him.  However we
got bogged down in the definition of adjunction.

In hindsight I think the quickest way to explain a monad to an
algebraist is to do so directly in terms of T, \mu, and \eta, without
the distraction of the additional machinery of the three above methods.
  It would go something like the following, which of the above three is
closest to the Kleisli category approach.  I'll ignore the inconsistent
monads, those axiomatized by x=y, for which T(X) = 1 for nonempty X and
T(0) <= 1.

A monad specifies the language and equations of an equational theory.
The functor T specifies the language by providing for each set X the set
of operations (more properly polynomials or abstract terms) of arity X,
e.g. T(2) is the set of binary operations of the theory.  The
multiplication \mu_X: T(T(X)) --> T(X) specifies the theory by mapping
terms of height at most two to operations (identified with terms of
height at most one).  Terms s and t of height two identified by \mu,
e.g. x(y+z) = xy+xz in the case of ring theory, constitute the axioms s
= t of the theory determined by \mu.

Hardware types and visual thinkers can picture T(X) as a black box
containing all operations of arity X.  X can be thought of as a row (or
any other layout, I like the unit interval [0,1] of reals for picturing
an uncountable set as a row) of input sockets on one side and T(X) as a
row of output plugs on the opposite side, one per operation.  The unit
\eta_X: X --> T(X) at X, necessarily an injection, ensures that the
operations include the variables, qua (formal) projections.  Thinking of
T(X) as consisting of terms, define the height of each variable to be
zero and that of the remaining operations of T(X) as one.

Since T can take any set of variables it can take in particular T(X),
whence there is also a box with input set T(X) and output set T(T(X)).
The boxes containing T(X) and T(T(X)) can be plugged together to form a
single black box with set X of inputs and set T(T(X)) of outputs.

However this latter set must now be interpreted as consisting of
entities of arity X instead of arity T(X).  Viewed syntactically (taking
into account the separate contents of the two boxes and how they attach)
we can consider the outputs of T(T(X)) as terms of height two in the
variables in X, or rather at most two since the unit of the monad embeds
X in T(X) and T(X) in T(T(X)).

One can then ask whether any of these terms realize some operation not
among those of T(X).  The function \mu_X: T(T(X)) --> T(X) accomplishes
three things.

(i) It interprets every term of height up to two as an operation of
T(X), a form of abstract evaluation that hides the two-level term structure.

(ii) In so doing it answers the above question in the negative: no new
operations, all terms of height up to two realize operations already
present in T(X).  In this sense T as a graded set of operations is
closed under substitution.

(iii) As noted above it axiomatizes the equational theory associated
with the monad with all equations of that theory involving terms of
height at most two, namely all equations s = t such that \mu_X maps s
and t to the same operation of T(X).

\mu can be extended to evaluate terms of height h inductively.  If
\mu_h: T^h --> T evaluates terms of height up to h then the vertical
composite \mu T(\mu_h): T^{h+1} --> T^2 --> T evaluates terms of height
up to h+1, starting from \mu_2 = \mu.  (So \mu_h = \mu T(\mu)
T^2(\mu)...T^{h-2}(\mu).)  This is the categorical counterpart of using
equational logic to inductively build up the height of equations in the
theory one level at a time via \mu, starting from the equations
constituting the kernel of \mu.

(Although height is always finite there is no such restriction on arity
and hence on width of a term, which can be any set.  Even for a finitary
monad an operation can take uncountably many arguments, e.g. for the
monad for Vct_R as the variety of vector spaces over the reals, each
operation in T(T(2)) takes as many parameters as there are linear
combinations ax+by, namely uncountably many, though it depends on only
finitely many of them because Vct_R is a finitary variety in the sense
Steve Lack referred to on Friday.)

If the boxes really do consist of operations then the two pluggings
required to form a chain T(X), T(T(X)), T(T(T(X))) of three black boxes
should have the same operational effect regardless of the order in which
they're performed.  The associativity axiom for a monad enforces this
property of black boxes containing operations.  The above inductive
definition of \mu_h was bottom-up (T^{h+1} = TT^h) but there is an
equivalent top-down one (T^h T) producing the same \mu_h.

The Eilenberg-Moore category of a monad is the variety of algebras it
axiomatizes, modulo details of the treatment of the associated
signature.  In general the signature will be a proper class but in many
  cases encountered in practice one can pick out of this class a (small)
set sufficient for a basis of operations, e.g. +, -, and the scalar
multiplications for Vct_k, or NAND and a constant for Boolean algebra.
The variety of sigma-algebras is not finitary although it can still be
furnished with a small signature, but this is not possible for the
varieties of complete semilattices and of complete atomic Boolean
algebras, which old-school algebraists would not consider varieties for
that reason.

The Kleisli category is the full subcategory of the variety consisting
of its free algebras.  The latter is intimately linked to the above
intuitions, and amounts to an equivalent way of seeing that T is closed
under substitution by formulating substitution as the composition of the
Kleisli category.

The essential point of departure from the usual notion of a monoid as a
fixed set is that for the type T^2 --> T of multiplication, T^2 is
defined via composition instead of cartesian product.  Monads are
therefore simply monoids adapted in this way to accommodate their
variability.

Monads need not be sets.  Just as a ring can be defined as a monoid
object in Ab, with the domain of multiplication being formed via
cartesian product in Ab, so can a monad be a monoid object in the
category of endofunctors of Ab, with the domain of multiplication being
formed by functor composition in Ab^Ab.  Although not all categories
have finite products, T^2 is defined for every category C and
endofunctor T: C --> C.

Dear Tim,
I heard from Eraldo Giuli and Anna Tozzi yesterday morning soon after
the quake.
They all are safe (and their families). My be Eraldo's hause was
slightly damaged, not Anna's.
Anyway, they plan to move to their  hauses  along the coast where the
quake had no effect.

Tim -

I have been in telephone contact with Eraldo Giuli. His and Anna Tozzi's
families are fine. They are currently staying with their families away
from the town of L'Aquila, in order to avoid the aftershocks. They do,
however, report considerable damage to some of their properties in L'Aquila.

Regards,
Walter.

Dear Tim,
    I just succeeded in getting in touch by phone with Eraldo,
after trying for quite a long time. Eraldo, his family and all the other
colleagues are fine. Eraldo lost a family flat in the center of the town,
but nobody was injured. He will not be able to be contacted by e-mail
for quite a long time, and is now staying in his house at the beach
nearby L'Aquila. Eraldo asked me to inform the colleagues and friends.
           Best wishes,
                               Aurelio.

CAM-CAD

Workshop on  Computer Algebra Methods and Commutativity of Algebraic Diag=
rams

IRIT, Toulouse  (France)
October 2009


*** FIRST CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ***
*** AND ***
*** PAPERS ***

Categorical diagrams have multiple applications
in mathematics (algebra, topology) and computer science
(models and metamodels, rewriting systems, higher order
languages). Diagrams (understood less strictly) can be found
in physics, chemistry and other scientific domains.
One meets many similar problems in
computer-assisted treatment of diagrams in all these
domains concerning algorithms, graphic interfaces,
interaction with systems of computer algebra and
other software. In spite of importance of diagrammatic
methods, they are relatively little developped
and underrepresented in the world of computer-assisted
reasoning.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers working on
these subjects, to assess the current state of the art and
identify open problems and future research directions.

The main topics may be listed (non-exhaustively) as follows:
algorithms that may be used in computer-assisted treatment of diagrams,
treatment of diagrams in existing computer algebra systems,
formal developments related to diagrams and
category theory in proof-assistants,
user interfaces and graphics for categorical diagrams.

There will be space for talks presenting original work,
work in progress, applications, survey of previous works.
We plan to provide sufficient time for discussions. Details on
paper submission will be given in a further announcement.

Papers presented at the workshop will be published on the
web site of the workshop and may be selected for submission,
in complete and revised form, to a special issue of an
international journal, in case their number and quality
justify it.

Important dates:

Submission deadline:

   send short abstract (title) by 30 June 2009  by e-mail
   to soloviev@irit.fr

   send either a full paper or an extended abstract by 30 September 2009

there is something similar in algebraic logic. The class of locally
finite cylindric/polyadic algebras is not a variety and the forgetful
functor to Set is not monadic (l.f. means that all relations are of
finite arities). In categorical logic (hyperdoctrines), these algebras
are considered in many-sorted signatures, in fact, as algebras over
graphs, and their theory becomes equational (= the corresponding
forgetful functor to Graph is monadic). Probably, it's a general
phenomenon wrt specifying finitary objects: by indexing them with
finite sets (contexts, supports,arities), we get equational theories
over graph-like structures.

In a wider (and partly speculative) setting, the shift from classical
algebraic to categorical logic is a shift from simple signatures and
complex theories to  complex signatures and simple theories. In a
sense, this is what category theory does wherever it applies to
classical problems: it greatly simplifies the logic (and the internal
structure), but pays for this by a complex vocabulary (the external
structure, interface). A typical example is classical vs. categorical
set theories.

Thus, a categorical model is a device with a structurally complex
interface and simple internal logic. An average user prefers, of
course, simple-looking interfaces of classical theories (and
eventually has to pay for this choice but it happens later on...). So,
for marketing categorical models, it's important to provide good
manuals for their complicated interfaces -- what Vaughan just did for
monads.

====================================================

1 POSTDOC and 1 PHD POSITION in the MathWiki project

          at Radboud University Nijmegen (NL)

          http://www.fnds.cs.ru.nl/fndswiki/Vacancies

The Institute for Computing and Information Science of the Radboud
University Nijmegen (NL) is looking for 2 researchers to work on the NWO
project "MathWiki a Web-based Collaborative Authoring Environment for
Formal Proofs".

The vacancies are:

- a POSTDOC for the period of 3 years
vacancy number: 62-16-09


- a PHD POSITION for the period of 4 years
vacancy number: 62-17-09

AIMS OF THE PROJECT
===================
The aim of the MathWiki project is to open up to a wider community the
rich collections of knowledge stored in the repositories of proof
assistants.

To this end we will build a web-based collaborative authoring
environment for formal mathematics, the MathWiki system. This system
will provide interactive web access through a standardized interface to
a number of proof assistants. The MathWiki system will also be a
platform for the development of formal proofs within those proof
assistants and it will provide high level access (through Wikipedia-like
web pages) to their repositories of formalised mathematics. These
repositories will reside on the server.

In the project we will study and further develop Wiki technology and
semantic web technology, all in the context of proof assistant
repositories of formalized mathematics. The project thus brings together
the open nature of Wiki authoring with expertise in Proof Assistants and
Semantic Web technologies to build a new Wiki for mathematics,
supporting content creation, search and retrieval.

>From the perspective of the ordinary user of mathematics, MathWiki will
be important because it will provide high-level mathematical content on
the web in a much more coherent and precise way than is available at
present.

>From the proof assistant user perspective, MathWiki will be important
because it will provide an advanced environment for the collaborative
authoring of verified mathematics, mediated simply by a web interface.

The MathWiki system will be based on our existing experience with proof
assistant technology on the web, the "ProofWeb" systems, see
http:://prover.cs.ru.nl

There is yet another way to see logic monoid => monad.

Definition. Let N be a full subcategory of a category G. A monad (or clone) over N is a pair (K, T) where K is a category with Ob K = Ob N and T is a functor T: K -> G such that for any A, B, C in N
(i) K(A, B) = G(A, TB).
(ii) f(Tg) = fg for any f in K(A, B) and g in K(B, C) (the order of composition is from left to right).

A monad over a category G (in the usual sense) is a monad over the subcategory N = G of G, with K as the Kleisli category and T the right adjoint of the adjunction. A monoid is simply a monad over a singleton (as a subcategory of the category of sets).

Examples: Let G = Set be the category of sets.
1. A clone over a singleton is (equivalent to) a monoid.
2. A clone over a finite set is a unitary Menger algebra.
3. A clone over a countably infinite set is simply called a clone.
4. A clone over the subcategory of finite sets  is a clone in the classical sense (or a Lawvere theory), which corresponds to a locally finitary clone in the sense of 3 above.
5. A clone over a one-object category is a Kleisli algebra  in the sense of E. Manes.

For a monad the left algebras (Eilenberg-Moore algebras) represent the smantics (model) and right algebras represent the syntax (logic) of the monad. The theory of right algebras, which is missing from the classical approach to monads, may be applied to study mathematical logic, lambda calculus and recursion theory effectively.

I am not sure I completely understand your comments. I guess it may be
helpful to be more precise:

F : FinSet -> Set
F A = Real -> A

together with:

>

eta_A : A -> F A
eta a = \ b . if a=b then 1 else 0

(>>=) : F A -> (A -> F B) -> F B
v >>= f = \ b. \Sigma a:A.(v a)*(f a b)

My notation is inspired by functional programming and naturally as a
Computer Scientist I am interested in the constructive content of
theorems. This construction only works if the input is decidable
(needed for eta) and if we can define Sigma (this certainly works if A
is finite).

I can see how to lift F to a functor on Sets by using a Kan extension
(left ?). In my terminology it may be something like

F' : Set -> Set
F' X = Sigma A:FinSet. A -> X x F A

I suspect my eta and >>= give then rise to a monad on Set? However, I
don't see how to do this if the vector spaces are not finite.

Btw, I only used this as an example. My question was rather wether
people have studied monoids in categories of functors which are not
endofunctors. I believe this notion is useful in functional
programming and Type Theory as a natural generalisation of the notion
of a monad.

Cheers,
Thorsten

Dear Thorsten,

I'm not familiar with the notation that you are using, although I can
guess what is meant in some cases


>
> I am not sure I completely understand your comments. I guess it may be
> helpful to be more precise:
>
> F : FinSet -> Set

I assume you mean A->Real. It's true that the monad for vector spaces sends
a finite set A to R^A, which can be seen as the set of functions from A to
R.

For a general set A (not necessarily finite) FA is the set of functions from
A to R of finite support. Equivalently, FA is the set of formal finite
linear combinations of elements of A.

> I suspect my eta and >>= give then rise to a monad on Set? However, I

Yes, this gives a monad on Set whose algebras are vector spaces, not
necessarily finite dimensional. I'm not sure what it is you claim to be
doing when you "do this". In any case there is a monad on Set whose
algebras are vector spaces; there is not a monad on Set whose algebras are
finite dimensional vector spaces. You can see this last statement by noting
that the category of algebras for a monad on Set is always cocomplete.

Yes, monoids in categories of functors are useful concepts. Of course to
define a monoid you need a monoidal structure on the ambient category. There
may be many possibilities, and for some of them the corresponding notion of
monoid looks more like a monad than for others. For some monoidal structures
one should really think of the monoids as not generalizations of monads, but
special cases of monads. Your example of finitary monads is a good example.
So are operads. There are more examples in the paper "notions of Lawvere
theory" available from my home page or as arXiv:0810.2578.

Regards,

Steve Lack.

Yes, they have. Two quick examples of such categories, =

and what monoids in them boil down to:

1) simplicial sets (cf. Gabriel-Zisman or D.M. Kan for
just how this is a functor category) -- here monoids =

are "simplicial monoids." Of particular interest, =

of course: simplicial groups.

2) modules over a fixed (commutative, say) ring R (a
functor category of the form [R, Ab] from the one-object
additive category R to the category Ab of abelian groups,
consisting of course only of the additive functors) --
here monoids boil down to R-algebras (what in the older
van der Waerden terminology were called hypercomplex
systems over R).

In each instance, of course, one must be careful to
specify correctly just which "product" bifunctor on
the functor category is to be used in the definition
of "monoid" -- in case (2) it's not the usual =

(cartesian) product but, rather, a suitable tensor =

product one that one wants to be using.

I'll let others provide other illustrative examples.

Cheers, -- Fred

There will be an informal workshop on

      Quantum Logic Insipred by Quantum Computation

at Indiana University, May 11-12.

Our aim is to organize a small workshop that would bring together people
who are developing new areas of logic coming from quantum computation, and
also people who are interested in related projects coming from areas of
philosophical logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science.

Information on speakers may be found at www.indiana.edu/~iulg/qliqc.

There is no formal registration and all are welcome, but we would
appreciate knowing ahead if you plan to come.

Hi category gurus and categorists

=20

I have many questions about category theory but i start with one.

=20

1>

What are smooth functors and proper functors=2C originating in pursuing sta=
cks?

Both nontechnically and technicaly.

=20

I know they are dual to each other and that they are characterized by cohom=
ological properties

inspired by the proper or smooth base change theorem in algebraic geometry=
=2C but what is the relation?

(I don't know the statement of the theorems)

=20

Finally=2C what are smooth and proper functors good for?

Are smooth and proper functors fibrations and cofibrations or Grothendieck =
fibrations and

Grothendieck op-fibrations in some model categories or derivators?

=20

The only thing i could find about smooth and proper functors on internet is=
 the last entrance in

Hi,

The following paper is very clear, I'm currently learning the basics =20
of the subject with it: http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~maltsin/ps/=20
asphbl.ps. It's written in French. Another member of this mailing-=20
list has asked me to translate it in English, I may be able to send =20
you a rough translation in a few weeks.

Best,

Jonathan

Hi Rafael,

I don't know much about this, but I listened to an excellent talk of
Maltsiniotis a few months ago at IHES and posted the scanned notes in
a blog post here:

http://homotopical.wordpress.com/2009/01/26/maltsinotis-grothendieck-and-homotopical-algebra/

These notes (on page 11-12) contain at least the definition of proper
and smooth functors, and the duality statement, so maybe they can be
of some limited use. Hopefully other people on this list can provide
some more substantial information.

Best regards,
Andreas Holmstrom

Dear category theorists,
I noticed recently that the category whose objects are categories with pullbacks and whose morphisms are pullback preserving functors is cartesian closed.  Given a pair of categories with pullbacks A and B, the internal hom [A,B] has objects: pullback preserving functors from A to B, and morphisms: cartesian natural transformations.
I have posted a short paper on the arxiv proving this fact:
http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2486
It seems like a fairly natural fact but is not to my knowledge in the literature.  I am wondering whether anyone was previously aware of this result, and if so whether it might  be mentioned somewhere in the literature?
Thanks,
John Bourke,
University of Sydney.

Let C,D be categories, let F be a functor from C to D, and let G be right
adjoint to F. In a recent paper of Connes and Consani, they consider the
following "pasting along an adjunction": let E be a category whose object
class is the union of the object class of C and the object class of D; and
given objects X,Y of E, let the hom-set hom_E(X,Y) be defined as follows:

-if X,Y are both in the object class of C, then hom_E(X,Y) = hom_C(X,Y).

-if X,Y are both in the object class of D, then hom_E(X,Y) = hom_D(X,Y).

-if X is in the object class of C and Y is in the object class of D, then
hom_E(X,Y) = hom_C(X,GY) = hom_D(FX,Y).

-if X is in the object class of D and Y is in the object class of C, then
hom_E(X,Y) is empty.

Composition is defined in a straightforward way. When C,D are closed
symmetric monoidal categories, then E has a natural closed symmetric
monoidal structure as well. Connes and Consani use this categorical
pasting to construct schemes over F_1, "the field with one element," and I
have worked out some variations and applications of this categorical
pasting which produce other useful objects (e.g. algebraic F_1-stacks and
derived F_1-stacks, which have some useful number-theoretic as well as
homotopy-theoretic properties).

I would like to know if this "pasting along an adjunction" is a special
case of some more general construction already known to category theory,
and if basic properties of pasting along an adjunction have already been
worked out and written down somewhere.

Thanks,
Andrew S.

Dear Andrew

There is a bicategory Mod whose objects are categories and whose
morphisms are "modules" (also called bimodules, profunctors and
distributors). A module from B to A is a functor m : A^op x B --> Set.
Modules m : B --> A and n : C --> B are composed using a tensor-product-
over-B-like process: see Lawvere's paper:
	<http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/1/tr1abs.html>.

Every functor g : B --> A gives a module g_* : B --> A taking (a,b) to
the set A(a,gb) (which you would write hom_A(a,gb) ).

The bicategory Mod has lax colimits (which we call collages because of
their gluing- and pasting-like nature).

Each single module m : B --> A can be regarded as a diagram in Mod.
The collage C of that diagram is the category whose objects are
disjointly
those of A and of B, morphisms between objects of A are as in A,
morphisms
between objects of B are as in B, there are no morphisms b --> a, while
C(a,b) = m(a,b). There are fully faithful functors i : A --> C and
j : B --> C
and such cospans A --> C <-- B are precisely the codiscrete cofibrations
in Cat. This was important in my paper in Cahiers:
<http://www.numdam.org:80/numdam-bin/feuilleter?id=CTGDC_1980__21_2>

Also see
	<http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/4/tr4.pdf>
which relates to stacks.

Your case is the collage of the module g_*. It doesn't matter whether g
has an adjoint or not (that simply allows the module to be expressed in
two different ways).

Regards,
Ross

In section 2.3.1 of

"Higher Topos Theory"
http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608040

Jacob Lurie motivates the notion of "inner fibrations" and of
Cartesian fibrations of (oo,1)-categories as a generalization of this
"pasting" construction.

"Pasting" along any bifunctor C^op x D --> Set is the same as having
an inner fibration over the interval (which is an arbitrary functor
for 1-categories), and the particular "pasting" that you mention, over
hom_D(F(-),-) coming from a functor F : C \to D, gives a Cartesian
fibration over the interval (top of p. 88, leading over to section
2.4).

Best,
Urs

Research project: "Applications of geometric logic to topos approaches
to quantum physics".

[I have already announced a PhD studentship on this project, but a 3 yr
post-doc position has now come available.]

I have received EPSRC funding for a 3-year project with a post-doctoral
research position and PhD studentship attached, to be conducted in the
School of Computer Science in the University of Birmingham, UK, and to
start between now and October. I would be very pleased to receive
applications.

The essential area of expertise for the post-doc is constructive
reasoning (with toposes and point-free topology), but the researcher
will also need to have or acquire some familiarity with quantum theory.

The funding allows for appointment at a high salary grade for a suitably
qualified and experienced researcher.

The "topos approaches" referred to are those of Isham and Doering (at
Imperial) and Heunen, Landsman and Spitters (at Nijmegen). By working
internally in suitable toposes, they are able to find (commutative)
Gelfand-Naimark spectra for systems that, externally, are non-
commutative. The hope is that this might lead to a style of reasoning
about quantum systems that, while logically non-classical, is
physically classical.

My project will look at trying to keep the intuitionistic, topos-
valid, internal reasoning within its geometric part. Insofar as this
is possible (and there is mounting evidence that substantial amounts
of practical mathematics can be done this way), it enables a language
of points, stalks, fibres and bundles for the point-free topology
involved. It is hoped that this will allow the topos approach to be
conducted in terms that are more conceptually transparent (in
particular to physicists), but also make it technically palatable to
move from the present presheaf toposes to sheaf toposes. Initial work
will focus on the geometric content of the Banaschewski/Mulvey
account of Gelfand-Naimark duality.

Further information can be found on my web site, at

   http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/geophysics.php#phd

I can also supply a more detailed project description on request.

Steve Vickers.

Dear category theorists,

May I draw to your attention my paper "Close categories vs. closed
multicategories" available at

http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3137

In the paper I prove that the 2-category of closed categories of
Eilenberg and Kelly is equivalent to a suitable full 2-subcategory of
the 2-category of closed multicategories. Comments are welcome!

Best,
Oleksandr

                           THIRD ANNOUNCEMENT

                                 * * *

  FMCS09 now has a website where one can reserve accommodation online.
  The address is

  http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/general-event/foundational-methods-computer-science-2009

  Participants in FMCS 2009 are guaranteed accommodations if reservations
  are made by April 28, 2009 through the link in the preceding web address.
  After April 28 the housing office will not guarantee accommodation for
  our group but will, however, continue to book in the same way as long as
  space is available.

  Reservations can be cancelled without penalty until 48 hours before the
  arrival date so it is to your advantage to book if there is even a slight
  possibility that you may attend.

  The next announcement will contain a more complete list of participants so
  if you are not on the current list of participants and you will or may
  attend, then please send email to johnm@math.ubc.ca with subject heading
  FMCS09 - WILL ATTEND or FMCS09 - MAY ATTEND.

  A preliminary schedule of talks as well as preregistration details will be
  posted on the website by May 4.

  In the meantime those who have never attended an FMCS meeting may wish to
  get an idea of the range of topics by looking at the talks given in 2008
  at Halifax appearing in http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/fmcs2008/

Hi John

Interesting result. Especially the way in which the
correct 2-structure follows from cartesian closure.

An analogous result may be the (exension from=20
posetal domains to categories of) closure under=20
filtered colimits of various shapes. Possibly there
is a common generalization to connected limits=20
or colimits ?

Every closed category can be embedded fully faithfully into a closed
monoidal category such that the closed structure is preserved; this is
due to Laplaza (exact reference in my paper). However, non-monoidal
closed categories do occur. I was motivated by the example of
A-infinity categories, and frankly, I am not aware of any other
non-trivial and non-artificial examples, but I am sure there must be
some, it is just my ignorance.

Best,
Oleksandr

Along with Francois Lamarche and various other people that I don't
clearly recall, I did a lot of work on this idea in the early 1990s.
I was based on earlier ideas by Pierre Ageron, Gerard Berry,
Yves Diers, Jean-Yves Girard, Peter Johnstone, Andre Joyal,
Christian Lair, ...

Since the motivations came from either domain theory or generalisations
of algebraic theories, the functors that were considered also preserved
directed joins or filtered colimits, but these are not relevant to the
basic cartesian closed structure.

One of the best known categories of posets like this is that of
"coherence spaces", which were described in Girard's book "Proofs
and Types", which Yves Lafont and I translated.

Earlier work by Berry had been the beginning of the search for
models of the notion of sequentiality in programming languages.

That by Diers had been about a generalisation of algebraic theories
to cover the case of fields, with unique disjunction.

In the categorical setting, I considered functors that preserve
pullbacks.  However, Andre Joyal, Francois Lamarche and others
considered functors that preserve squares that differ from a pullback
by an epi.  Then there's the question of whether to preserve
equalisers and/or cofiltered limits;  for such generalisations
I introduced the term "wide pullback".

Girard's version had a representation of the function-space.
I put this in categorical form by showing that there is a
factorisation system in which the "epis" are maps with left
adjoints and the "monos" are similar to discrete fibrations.
This system is closely related to the Street--Walters
"comprehensive" fibration.

I described a model whose objects are called "quantitative
domains" and which involves permutation groupoids.

See   www.PaulTaylor.EU/stable/   for my stuff on this subject.

There has been renewed interest in some of these things,
for which you should look out for words like "species",
"shape", "container".

Dear category theorists,


Sorry for my following stupid questions , but i would like:

-Given a monoidal category M , for first assumed to be strict, What kind =
of
thing do we obtain when we take it's classifying space ?: we take the ner=
ve of M
and then realising the simplicial sets obtained=20

Explicitely there are theses questions :

1) Does the nerve of M "preserve" (or "reflect")  the monoidal structure =
of M ?

    -Is it a monoid in the category of simplicial sets ?=20
    -If yes , can we have conditions on a monoid of sSet to be the nerve =
of a
monoidal category ? I mean, does some kind of "segal condition" ?



2) And What kind of topological spaces of the realization of the nerve
   -Is it a topological monoid , with some extra structure ?=20


3) And what hapen if M is not strict, or is symmetric, or braided , etc..=
.=20





Thank you and sorry if these are completely stupid  questions=20

         DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS: 31st May 2009
***************************************************************

Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic allowing direct reference
to worlds/times/states. It is easy to justify interest in hybrid
logic on the grounds of applications, as the additional expressive
power is very useful.  In addition, hybrid-logical machinery
improves the behaviour of the underlying modal formalism.  For
example, it becomes considerably simpler to formulate modal proof
systems, and one can prove completeness and interpolation results
of a generality that is not available in orthodox modal logic.
But more generally, the topic of this special issue is not only
standard hybrid-logical machinery (like nominals, satisfaction
operators, binders, etc.) but also extensions of modal logic that
increase its expressive power in one way or other.

For more general background on hybrid logic, and many of the key
papers, see the Hybrid Logics homepage (http://hylo.loria.fr/).

The special issue will welcome papers in a wide range
of topics, including description logic, feature logic, applied
modal logics, temporal logic, and labelled deduction.

We welcome both theoretical work and work describing systems and
applications on hybrid logics, broadly conceived.

All submissions will be peer reviewed with respect to the usual
journal criteria. Authors are invited to submit original,
previously unpublished, research papers written in English.

SUBMISSION DETAILS:

Papers should not exceed 25 pages including references. Authors
are required to prepare their submissions in latex, using the

Subject:  The development  of  space systems  (including on-board  and
ground systems)  requires complex engineering and  relies upon various
disciplines. Until now,  the success of such projects  has relied upon
the quality and experience of engineers as well as on partly-automated
development  processes.  However,  although  some technical  artifacts
(e.g: mathematical  model of a battery, satellite  simulator) are used
in such  developments, there  is still =E2=80=94and  mainly=E2=80=94 a huge=
  amount of
paper documentation expressed in natural language. This complexity and
diversity of technical means mitigate  the validation of a whole space
system.    Systems  model-based   development,  inspired   by  similar
approaches in the software field,  is gaining more and more importance
both  in  the  industrial  and  academic  communities.   However,  the
mainstream  solutions  currently  proposed are  still  unsatisfactory,
notably on  two major points: =E2=80=93  on one hand,  the requirement capt=
ure
phase and  its further refinement  towards a formal  specification are
not well  taken into account;  =E2=80=93 on the  other hand, there is  stil=
l a
lack of formal semantics  for architectural models.  Both these points
have obviously a  strong impact on the verification  and validation of
such  systems.  The  objective  of  this PhD  is  to propose  relevant
concepts  for a  modeling  language addressing  these questions.   The
solution to  the first problem  may rely on  goal-oriented requirement
engineering, in  the style  of KAOS or  Tropos methods...   The second
question will  be addressed by devising  formal architectural concepts
with  further  (semi-)automated  verification  in  mind.   Categorical
and/or   algebraic   approaches,   process   calculi,   model-oriented
techniques  (such as  the B  method)  will be  favoured. Results  from
software  engineering,  such as  component-based  development will  be
taken into account. The results of the PhD will be backed up by a case

Subject: A  current approach to  the engineering of  systems (software
systems, sociotechnical systems, systems of systems, etc.) consists in
modeling them,  during specification  and design phases,  according to
various  viewpoints. This  approach aims  at helping  engineers handle
extremely complex systems by  providing them with a view corresponding
to their  sole business (e.g  air or space  regulation, dependability,
realtime  performance,  etc.),  abstracting  from other  concerns.  Of
course,  the viewpoints  that  are  useful may  strongly  vary on  the
context,  henceforth   entailing  the  recurring   definition  of  new
multi-view  modeling languages.   This definition  is  usually ad-hoc,
which forces language designers  either to ignore semantic matters and
remain on  a purely syntactic definition,  or to propose  a new formal
semantics  and  demonstrate a  certain  number  of otherwise  standard
results.  The aim  of this PhD is to propose  a theoretical setting to
assist  in  the  creation  of  multi-view  languages  out  of  =E2=80=9Csma=
ll=E2=80=9D
predefined modeling languages (each  one being concerned with only one
topic). The major question is then to determine under which conditions
it  is possible  to  deduce  the formal  semantics  of the  multi-view
language from the semantics  of its constituent languages. Another way
to  state this problem  is to  say that  we aim  at provding  a formal
semantics to  aspect-oriented metamodeling.  The  foreseen theoretical
solutions essentially rely on categorical approaches: algebraic speci-
fication, theory of institutions,  graph grammars, etc. The results of
the PhD will be backed up by  a case study and may be implemented in a
software prototype.

Candidate  profile:  MSc  in  computer  science or  in  logic,  having
followed  some  =E2=80=9Ctheory=E2=80=9D   courses  (e.g  logic,  =CE=BB-ca=
lculus,  process

  Workshop announcement: 18 June 2009 at Burnside Hall, McGill, Montreal.

   We wish to announce a one-day workshop seminar, a "prequel" to the
   Makkaifest which is being held at CRM 19-20 June (with a reception
   on the evening of 18 June).

    http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Makkaifest09/
    http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Makkaifest09/index_e.php

   This workshop is intended for the participants of the Makkaifest,
   and will end in time to allow attendance at the reception at 6pm.

   If you are interested in attending the workshop, please let us (Phil
   Scott or Robert Seely) know so we can book a room of suitable size.
   Any participants who would like to give a talk in the workshop should
   contact one of the workshop organisers (Phil Scott or Robert Seely)
   *as soon as possible*, as places are very limited.  The themes of
   the workshop are those of the Makkaifest itself, and should reflect the
   interests shown by Michael Makkai over his career.

   We will announce a schedule of talks later, probably late May or
   early June.  We expect the talks to start around 9am and to finish
   by 5pm, so there'll be time to get to the reception at CRM at 6pm.

   The workshop will be an informal affair - there will be no
   registration, and no "refreshments" (people can buy their own
   coffee, and lunch will be "dutch treat").

  Phil Scott (phil@site.uottawa.ca)
  Robert Seely (rags@math.mcgill.ca)

Dear Hugo,

Your question involves the functors

       N           | |
Cat -----> SSet ------> Top

(nerve and geometric realization) and their composite, the classifying
space functor B.

1. The nerve functor N has a left adjoint, so in particular it preserves
finite products.  Hence if M is a monoid in Cat (i.e. a strict monoidal
category) then N(M) is, in a natural way, a monoid in SSet.

2. It's also true, though not totally obvious, that the geometric
realization functor | | preserves finite products.  So if X is a monoid
in SSet then |X| is a topological monoid.

3. Putting these together, if M is a strict monoidal category then its
classifying space B(M) is a topological monoid.

If M is a non-strict monoidal category then B(M) is not necessarily a
topological monoid in a natural way, but it is a "homotopy topological
monoid" in any of several accepted senses.  For instance, it is a
Delta-space in the sense of Segal, and an A_infinity-space in the sense of
Stasheff (although that doesn't deal satisfactorily with the unit).

Similarly, if M is a symmetric monoidal category then B(M) is a "homotopy
topological commutative monoid", e.g. a Gamma-space or an E_infinity
space.

Best wishes,
Tom

A small issue - this works provided the destination of the geometric
realization is the category of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces.
Otherwise, as in Milnor's original paper, there are limitation on the
simplicial sets involved.

The small issue cited by Bob has further ramifications.

Actually the geometric realization  functor  "should"
preserve all finite limits. That is probably a main reason
(along with the lack of function spaces) for the gradual demise=20
of Top (and its relatives like Locales) as the default model=20
of cohesion.

A functor with a right adjoint and preserving finite limits
is the inverse image of a geometric morphism of toposes,
provided it is between toposes. Can Top be reasonably=20
replaced by a topos that will serve all purposes of
algebraic topology, functional analysis, etc ? Yes, as=20
Peter Johnstone showed some years ago, using in fact=20
a well-known monoid as site.

The issue for simplicial realization in particular is whether
- the unit interval is totally ordered or not and whether
-its endpoints are distinct.=20
That is because simplicial sets is precisely the classifying
 topos for such structures, as was pointed out by Joyal and
explained well  both in Johnstone and in Mac Lane & Moerdijk.
(The second condition justifies the omission of 0 from the Delta site).

Johnstone used the monoid of continuous endomaps of the
generic convergent sequence to achieve the total order of the unit
interval; the internal meaning of the latter is that inside the square
there is no subobject containing both solid triangles. No sheaf, that is.

But Peter achieved that solution after detailed study led him  to reject=20
another  model, proposed by several people whose=20
geometric intuition does not include Peano curves, undecidable
 statements, etc (e.g., me). That proposal, namely that the basic
figures of topology are continuous curves, had to be rejected=20
at the then-current level of knowledge because the usual model
for the shape of these figures, the unit interval as constructed in=20
traditional set theory, admits far too many endomaps, along which=20
coverings must be stable by pullback; thus too few coverings , too
many sheaves.  This leads to the reasonable demand for a submonoid
of those continuous reparametrizers, containing polynomials and lattice
operations but not containing, for example, the coordinates of a=20
Peano curve  in the square.

That demand is very similar to the one put forth by Grothendieck in=20
his proposal for TAME TOPOLOGY.  I pointed out several years ago
that Grothendieck's demand is related to the achievements
of mathematicians working on so-called O-minimal models, and  some=20
of the of them in fact mention Grothendieck's slogan in their discussions.
But I am not aware of any publications addressing the issue exposed by Pete=
r.

Can we now understand by example the kind of monoid desired ?

Best wishes
Bill

It took a while but categories@mta.ca archives starting from 1997 have
been successfully imported into gmane. It will take a while until all
the messages are correctly sorted by date.

The archives are accessible at

http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.science.mathematics.categories

Merit for the import should go to gmane's administrator, Lars Magne
Ingebrigtsen <larsi@gnus.org>

Thanks a lot for your help.
