This is to reannounce a selection of Web-based category theory
demonstrations that I've put up at
http://www.j-paine.org/cgi-bin/webcats/webcats.php .

The page contains a number of buttons such as "generate and demonstrate an
equaliser" and "generate and demonstrate a limit". Clicking on one will
generate an example of the construct in the category of finite sets, and
display it as a listing of its objects and arrows, and as a diagram. My
latest demo generates examples of exponential objects, using the same
notation as the Wikipedia article at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_object .

Bug reports, and suggestions for improvement, would be very welcome.

I have a memory that someone (Linton or Manes, maybe) proved a variation
on the PTT involving split ERs.  Can someone provide a reference?  I
thought it would be in LNM 80, but I couldn't find it there.

It turns out that what I asked about is in TTT, Section 9.1.  It starts on
p. 250 of the electronic version, p. 303 of the print edition.  The result
is due to Jack Duskin.

Hi Walter, let me advert my paper
on a similar and related subject
http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0602463
"Flatness, preorders and generalized metric spaces"
that treats completions of non symmetric spaces.
It took some time to be written but it is going to
appear (in an improved version) in the
Georgian Mathematical Journal.

Cheers,
V.

reminds me of a question I've been meaning to ask for several years, in
fact since my CT'04 talk on communes over bimodules, but wasn't quite
sure how to formulate.

In any setting, ordinary or enriched, it is possible to introduce
presheaves immediately after defining "category," even before defining
"functor."

Ordinarily one does not do so because functors are more fundamental to
category theory than presheaves, being an essential stepping stone to
the notion of natural transformation, Mac Lane's motivating entity for
the whole CT enterprise.

But just as dessert tends to lose its appeal when complete demolition of
the main course is a prerequisite, so are applications of CT most
effective for a foreign (non-CT) audience when they don't assume that
the whole CT enchilada has been digested.  For applications of
presheaves it is helpful to know what is the absolute minimum of CT
required by the audience.

Just as it is not necessary to understand the principle of the internal
combustion engine when getting one's driver's license by showing that
one can control such an engine, it should not be necessary to know what
a functor, natural transformation, adjunction, or colimit is to freely
construct a presheaf on a small category J as a colimit.  The following
construction should suffice for those who know nothing more about CT
than the definition of category.

Grow a presheaf category C starting with C = J (with Set^{J^op} as the
unstated secret goal) as follows.  Independently adjoin objects x to C.
  For each such x and each object j in J, further adjoin morphisms from
j to x (more generally in the V-enriched case, assign an object of V to
C(j,x)), with composites of the morphisms of C(j,x) with those of J
chosen subject only to the requirement that C remain a category.  For
any objects x,y of C, with x not in J (y in J is ok), populate C(x,y)
with as many morphisms f,g,... as possible (in the V-enriched case, a
suitable limit), again choosing composites with morphisms from any j to
x arbitrarily, subject to the requirements that (i) if for all j and all
morphisms a: j --> x, fa = ga, then f = g, and (ii) again that C remain
a category (which then determines all remaining composites x --> y -->
z).  A pre-question here is, did I inadvertently leave anything out?

My main question is, is there a reference for this process that I can
cite?  Any such reference must make the point that the prerequisites for
this process include categories but exclude the rest of CT (as
prerequisites---obviously some additional parts of CT are directly
derivable, the point is that they're not prerequisites for the student).

Ordinarily one reason for not bothering with such a thing would be that
one can avoid even the categories by talking about equational theories
with only unary operations.  My application however is to communes,
which are trickier to describe from a purely algebraic perspective
(they're chupological rather than coalgebraic), but very natural from
the above colimit-based perspective.

PSSL 88 - supplementary announcement

Dear all,

We are delighted by the large number of registrations
and talk proposals we have had for the PSSL in honour
of the joint 60th birthdays of Martin Hyland and Peter
Johnstone.

However, we have already had more talks proposed than
we can accommodate.  Therefore if you would like to
propose a talk and have not already done so, we now
ask you to let us know by January 31st rather than the
end of February as originally planned.  The deadline
for applying for funding is also January 31st, as before.

The PSSL announcement email and registration form can
be found here:

http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/pssl88/announce2.html


Apologies for the inconvenience.

Eugenia Cheng

Carnegie Mellon Summer School in Logic and Formal Epistemology

In the summer of 2009, the Department of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon
University will hold a three-week summer school in logic and formal
epistemology for promising undergraduates in philosophy, mathematics,
computer science, linguistics, and other sciences.

The goals are to

   o introduce students to cross-disciplinary fields of research at an
     early stage in their career; and
   o forge lasting links between the various disciplines.

The summer school will be held from Monday, June 8 to Friday, June 26,
2009. There will be morning and afternoon lectures and daily problem
sessions, as well as planned outings and social events.

The summer school is free. That is, we will provide

   o full tuition, and
   o dormitory accommodations on the Carnegie Mellon campus.

So students need only pay round trip travel to Pittsburgh and living
expenses while there. There are no grades, and the courses do not
provide formal course credit.

Instructions for applying can be found on the summer school web page,

   http://www.phil.cmu.edu/summerschool

Materials must be received by the Philosophy Department by March 15,
2009.

This year's topics are:

   Categories and Structures
   Monday, June 8 to Friday, June 12
   Instructor: Steve Awodey

   Decisions and Games
   Monday, June 15 to Friday, June 19
   Instructor: Teddy Seidenfeld

   Logic and Formal Verification
   Monday, June 22 to Friday, June 26
   Instructor: Jeremy Avigad

The summer school is open to undergraduates, as well as to students
who will be completing their first year of graduate school. Applicants
need not be US citizens. There is a $20 nonrefundable application
fee.

Inquiries may be directed to Jeremy Avigad (avigad@cmu.edu).

Folk,

Each definition of a limit which I've=20
seen contains something I would describe=20
as a "probe object" or "test object".  The=20
definition of map object in L&S page 313=20
for example, has X with a criterion asserted=20
for every object X in the category.

Is there any sense in my terminology?

Dear mathematicians,
I wonder if the following is true. Has anybody a reference, if this is
the case?

Let V and W be two complete and cocomplete symmetric monoidal closed
categories and
L: V <--> W :R
an adjunction of (lax) symmetric monoidal functors. Let D be a small V-
category.
Is it true that there is a V-isomorphism
V-Fun(D,RW) = R(W-Fun(LD,W)) ?

(If not, is this at least the case if L is strict symmetric monoidal?)

Thank you for any help.
Tony

I often call them "test objects" in talking with students (by analogy
with "test particles" in General Relativity).  I don't think I have ever
done it in print.  But I did use "T" as the typical name of such an
object in my book.

I am curious to know what others think.

       Foundations for Computable Topology
       www.PaulTaylor.EU/ASD/foufct/

This paper is an overview of the whole of the Abstract Stone Duality
research programme.   I was invited to write it for a volume on
Foundations of Mathematics that is more inclined towards philosophy
than technicalities and has contributions from categorists, set
theorists and philosophers.  I advertised this in July, but the
production timescale of this book has slipped somewhat, so I would
still welcome comments.   In particular, I have some questions
below about citations for the history of category theory.

The plan of the paper is as follows:
1. Foundations should be designed FOR mathematics.
2. The formal link between category theory and symbolic logic.
3. Using this as a methodology to design the new theory.
4. Stone duality between topology and algebra over sets
5. Stone duality as a monad, with applications to topology
6. The axiomatic "monadic framework".
7. The subobject classifier and Sierpinski space.
8. Axiomatic development of set theory using the Euclidean principle
    and topology using the Phoa principle.
9. Discrete mathematics using overt discrete spaces,
    arithmetic universes, recursion, description.
10. The "underlying set" axiom, which makes the full subcategory
    of overt discrete spaces into a topos.
11. Scott continuity as an axiom.
12. Beyond local compactness.

The version of the last section as it appeared in July was COMPLETELY
SCRAPPED, and replaced with a discussion of "equideductive logic",
about which I talked at meetings in Sussex in September and Padova
in October.  Even in the present version, I still intend to replace
the last few pages with a "conclusion".

Briefly, equideductive logic is the (surprisingly interesting) logic
of regular monos in a CCC with all finite limits.   It is exactly
what is required to perform Dana Scott's "equilogical space"
construction, but without using the set theoretic interpretation
based on the set of points of the basic spaces.   I have done further
work on this, but I am nowhere near being ready to advertise it.

This paper does not discuss computation,  but Andrej Bauer did some
interesting programming during the summer:
math.andrej.com/2008/08/24/efficient-computation-with-dedekind-reals/

SOME HOSTORICAL QUESTIONS

Recall that the purpose of my paper is to give a general overview of
the philosophy and motivations of ASD, along with a statement of all
of the axioms for reference.   I am therefore looking for citations
that are also of a survey, historical or philosophical flavour,
rather than the original technical source.   The numbers refer to
the subsections or paragraphs -- the paper is written in a narrative
style, without Definition--Lemma--Theorem--Proof.   The non-bracketed
text is quoted from my paper.

2.6 [In a discussion of the relationship between category theory and
symbolic logic.] Systems such as linear logic that do not obey all of
the
structural rules correspond to different categorical structures.
These might, for example, be \emph{tensor} products~($\otimes$), which
categorists understood long before they did predicate logic.

3.7 [In a critique of point--set topology.] Sheaves in algebraic
geometry were based on open sets and not points

3.8 These books [on point--set topology] ... make little attempt to
explore the full extent of even the world that is measured out by
their own co-ordinate system.  This was only begun when the analogy
with the $\exists\land$-fragment of logic was recognised.

5.1 For this, we need a way of formulating (potentially infinitary)
algebraic theories that works over an arbitrary category $\S$, and not
just over the category of sets.  Such an account is provided by the
categorical notion of \emph{monad}.   [Has anyone ever tried to
write a textbook that covers the material of Modern or Universal
Algebra using monads?]

6.12 The problem of finding splittings is actually not a new one: it
was well known in homological algebra, which provided Jon Beck's
original inspiration. [Can you give me a simple example of the use
of splittings in homological algebra, and the difficulty in finding
them?]

9.1 Finite limits and stable effective quotients of equivalence
relations were studied in category theory long before it considered
logic, because categories of finitary algebras inherit them from sets.

9.12 For terms and parameters of these types, Scott continuity is a
\emph{theorem}, essentially the one of Henry Rice and Norman Shapiro.

Peter E observed that
> each definition of a limit which I've seen contains something
> I would describe as a "probe object" or "test object"
although I am not sure whether his question is about the name for
this (for which either of his suggestions is reasonable), or what.

Limits are, of course, examples of right adjoints, and the situation
that Peter describes is a case of the adjoint correspondence

   (considered as a trivial diagram) test object  ----->  diagram
   ==============================================================
                            test object ------>  limit of diagram

So the left adjoint is a "forgetful" functor,  which takes the test
object and considers it as a trivial diagram,  ie with identities
as edges.

Giving the test object a "name" in the sense of an English word
is not such a big deal.

However, I would argue that it is important to give it a "name"
in the sense of using a particular letter uniformly for it.

For this purpose, I propose the Greek letter capital Gamma.

The reason for this choice is that the same role is played in
symbolic logic by the "context",  ie the collection of parameters,
along with their types and hypotheses,  that occurs in any
mathematical statement.   In type theory, the letter Gamma is
traditionally and uniformly used for this purpose.

(Can some type or proof theorist tell me who introduced or
established this convention?)

Indeed, I use this convention both for this test object and for
other parts of the anatomy of an adjunction systematically throughout
my book, "Practical Foundations of Mathematics"  (CUP, 1999).

In so far as there was a previous convention in category theory for
the name of this object, it was "U".  This came from sheaf theory,
where, by the Yoneda lemma, we need only consider maps from
hom(-,U), where U belongs to the base category.  This category was
primordially the lattice of open subsets of a topological space,
so the convention came from that of using "U" for an open set.
I believe that German-speaking authors were responsible for this,
though I don't know what German word it was that began with U.

Speaking of sheaf theory,  when and to whom was it first apparent
that the category of sheaves depends only on the lattice of open
sets, and not on the points of a topological space?

 From a game-theoretic standpoint one can be either taking the test or
administering it.  Both sides call it the test, showing that the name is
stable under perp (change of team).

However that's not to say that "test" gives a helpful perspective in
either case.  A right adjoint defined by its adjunction is simply a
specification of *all* homsets to it, and dually, in the case of left
adjoints, of all the homsets from it.  What you're calling a "test"
object there is for me merely the variable being universally quantified
over in the definition of "all."

Whether a student is going to find it helpful thinking of a universally
quantified variable as a "test object" is going to be less a question of
what the student thinks about that perspective than what the teacher
thinks about it and whether they can convey their point of view.  The
mathematically talented student who immediately sees it is merely being
universally quantified over may be more puzzled than helped.

But then how many of us are so lucky as to have a significant number of
mathematically talented students in our classes?

In answer to Paul Taylor

Charles Ehresmann has realized as soon as 1951 (cf. "Charles =20
Ehresmann: Oeuvres compl=E8tes et comment=E9es", Part I, p. 153) that in a =
=20
pseudogroup of transformations only the open sets of the associated =20
topology are used, not the points, whence the idea of replacing the =20
pseudogroup of transformations by a  groupoid and the topology by a =20
paratopology (i.e., a complete distributive lattice).
He formalized this idea in later works, in particular in the 1957 =20
seminal paper "Gattungen von lokalen Strukturen" [Oeuvres, Part II, p. =20
126], where he replaces the pseudogroup of transformations by a local =20
groupoid, and even, more generally, by a local category, that is a =20
category equipped with a "local" order compatible with its structure =20
(in modern term it is a category internal to a category of locales); =20
and he develops the theory of complete local species of structures =20
over a local groupoid, which generalizes that of a sheaf.

Calculus teachers do something similar when they make an epsilon-delta proof
into a game:  The opponent picks an epsilon (the test object) and you have
to come up with a delta.
There is one big difference between epsilon-delta proofs and limits.  To
show that something is a limit you have to find, for each test object, the
unique arrow specified by the definition of limit.  Thus you are producing a
function (indeed, a bijection).   The delta for a given epsilon is not unique,
and so there is no natural function giving a delta for each epsilon.  I am
pretty sure this makes epsilon-delta proofs harder for non-talented students
than proving something is a limit.  I know some calculus teachers talk about
there being a function that takes epsilon to delta, but I suspect it is a
mistake to bring that up.

 When I teach limits I call Colin's "test object" a "competitor" to the true
limit, or "pretender to the throne", and describe the universal property as
saying "whatever you can do, I can do better".

This game-theoretic approach to universal properties becomes more
interesting when dealing with n-categorical weak limits: the two players
take turns making moves.  First the proponent picks a cone, then the
challenger picks a cone, then the proponent picks a map between cones, then
the challenger picks a map between cones, then the proponent picks a map
between maps between cones, etc..

This idea is important in opetopic n-categories, and there's also an
omega-categorical version - a nice discussion appears starting at the bottom
of page 32 of this paper by Makkai:

http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/equivalence/equivinpdf/equivalence.pdf

"The Hero has to answer each move of the Challenger [...] If Hero can keep
it up forever, he wins; otherwise he loses."

Best,
jb

This is getting peripheral to the main point.  AS far as I recall, I
thought of T as a test object.  As for epsilon-delta, Bishop required that
delta be prescribed as a constructible function of epsilon in order that a
function be continuous.  He required that the convergence be uniform on
every closed interval, so that this function on a closed interval was
independent of the points in the interval.

Without getting into discussion of the `game' aspect, I feel category
theorists should speak out against the epsilon-delta approach to limits as
against the neighbourhood
                       f(M) \subseteq N
approach, where the notation easily describes  the pictures. The
epsilon-delta approach is in terms of measurement of a neighbourhood, i.e.
one step away from the neighbourhood, and less actual (I almost wrote
`real'!), and students find that step difficult.  The utility of
epsilon-delta is in terms of calculation, rather than geometry and
structure.

The  `only measurable things are real' approach is based on the notion that
numbers are the most important aspect of science, rather than one tool to
investigate  structure.

I have always used the phrase "test object" in a slightly
different sense. Namely, to refer to a tractably small
collection of objects that one may use, not only to detect,
but also to calculate some right adjoint. Thus in Set, one
may take the terminal object; in Set/X, the elements 1-->X;
in Cat, the ordinals 1, 2 and 3; in presheaf categories, the
representables; and so on. The best case is that these test
objects are colimit dense, since then your calculations
always yield a right adjoint as soon as the functor you start
with preserves colimits.

of course, by choice (and many times without choice), there are lots of
functions \delta = f(\epsilon). It is a good question to see when there is a
continous such "f".

I do not do free work for journals published by publishers who make
enormous profits and pay nothing in return either to the authors or
reviewers.  In choosing to publish your proccedings in such a journal
rather than in the many journals that charge between 0 and and a tenth
what Elsevier does, you have chosen a path that ultimately would lead to
the destruction of scholarship.  It is insulting to ask me to cooperate in
such a venture.

Sincerely yours,

Michael Barr

ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Generic Programming 2009
Edinburgh, UK, August 30, 2009

    http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/WGP09

Goals of the workshop

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by
making them more general. Generic programs often embody
non-traditional kinds of polymorphism; ordinary programs are
obtained from them by suitably instantiating their parameters. In
contrast with normal programs, the parameters of a generic program
are often quite rich in structure; for example they may be other
programs, types or type constructors, class hierarchies, or even
programming paradigms.

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both
to practitioners and to theoreticians, and for at least 20 years
generic programming techniques have been a specific focus of
research in the functional and object-oriented programming
language communities. Generic programming has gradually spread to
more and more mainstream languages and is today widely used also
in industry. This workshop will bring together leading researchers
and practitioners in generic programming from around the world,
and feature papers capturing the state of the art in this
important area.

We welcome contributions on all aspects, theoretical as well as
practical, of

   * adaptive object-oriented programming,
   * aspect-oriented programming,
   * concepts (as in the STL / C++ sense)
   * component-based programming,
   * generic programming,
   * meta-programming,
   * polytypic programming,
   * programming with modules,
   * and so on.

Although this has nothing to do with categories, it should be of interest
to all mathematicians.  According to this:
http://groups.google.com/group/sci.math.research/browse_thread/thread/43d73791ca5d5cbd?hl=en
someone is claiming proof of the abc conjecture by adapting somehow the
valid proof for polynomial rings F[x] over a field that uses formal
differentiation (this can be found, e.g. in Lang's Algebra).  The abc
conjecture easily implies the Fermat Last Theorem as well as a number of
generalizations (such as the impossibility x^n + y^m = z^p with obvious
exceptions) and more.  It would be an astounding result.

1) Conference

Over the past fifteen years, the RelMiCS meetings have been a main forum for
researchers who use the calculus of relations and similar algebraic =20
formalisms as
methodological and conceptual tools. The workshop series on Applications of
Kleene algebra started with a Dagstuhl seminar in 2001 and has been co-
organised with the RelMiCS conference since. Due to their considerable =20
overlap,
the two events have a joint PC and joint proceedings.Their scope comprises
relation algebra, fixpoint calculi, semiring theory, iteration =20
algebras, process
algebras and dynamic algebras. Applications include formal algebraic =20
modelling,
the semantics, analysis and development of programs, formal language theory
and combinatorial optimisation.

We invite submissions on the general topics of Relation Algebra
and Kleene Algebra in computer science. Special focus will lie
on formal methods for software engineering, logics of programs and
links with neighbouring disciplines. Particular topics of the =20
conference cover, but
are not limited to the theory of

- relation algebras and Kleene algebras
- related formalisms such as process algebras, fixed point calculi, idempote=
nt
   semirings, quantales, allegories, dynamic algebras, cylindric =20
algebras and their
   applications in areas such as
   - verification, analysis and development of programs and algorithms
   - relational formal methods such as B or Z, tabular methods,
   - algebraic approaches to logics of programs, modal and dynamic logics,
     interval and temporal logics
   - algebraic semantics of programming languages
   - graph theory and combinatorial optimisation
   - games, automata and language theory
   - mechanised and automated reasoning, decision procedures
   - spatio-temporal reasoning, knowledge acquisition, preference and
     scaling methods
   - information systems.

The predecessors of this conference were held in Dagstuhl (January 1994),
Parati (September 1995), Hammamet (January 1997), Warsaw (September
1998), Quebec (January 2000), Dagstuhl (February 2001), Oisterwijk (October
2001), Malente (April 2003), St. Catherines (January 2005), Manchester
(September 2006) and Frauenwoerth (April 2008).

In the relationship between Lie groups and Lie algebras, there is the
neat result that the Lie functor L : LieGrp->LieAlg restricts to an
equivalence on the simply connected Lie groups, and that the fibre
over any given Lie algebra is the category of those G which are
isomorphic to quotients of the one simply connected one of them and
hence there is a Galois theory interpretation in terms of central
extensions.

I am sure that this sort of situation must be much more general than
just this case, and is somehow linked to abstract Galois theories. I
am hoping that someone can point out really neat categorical results
on this (in the literature).  I am sure I ought to know them but ...

It does not seem to be in Borceux-Janelidze, and my own library on
this area is very sadly thin on the ground.


Thanks in advance,

Tim

Dear Category Theorists,

as you know, there is a proliferation of monoidal categories with
additional structure, many of which have graphical languages. For
example: autonomous, balanced, braided, compact closed, pivotal,
ribbon, rigid, sovereign, spherical, tortile, traced.

I have recently written a survey article on all of these graphical
languages (and more). The goal was not to re-prove known theorems, but
simply to collect most known facts in one location, with references to
the primary literature. I have also tried to put a systematic
perspective on things. Consequently, I included many results and
conjectures that don't seem to appear in the literature at all, or for
which only special cases seem to be known.

Since this paper will not be refereed in the usual sense (it is
supposed to appear as a book chapter), I am instead inviting comments
and corrections from all interested parties. I am particularly
interested in missing references for any of the results or
conjectures, and of course any other corrections you might have.

The article is available from:
http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/papers.html#graphical

I hope this will be useful. Thanks! -- Peter

----------------------------------------------------------------------
P. Selinger: A survey of graphical languages for monoidal categories

December 2008. 59 pages.

Abstract: This article is intended as a reference guide to various
notions of monoidal categories and their associated string
diagrams. It is hoped that this will be useful not just to
mathematicians, but also to physicists, computer scientists, and
others who use diagrammatic reasoning. We have opted for a somewhat
informal treatment of topological notions, and have omitted most
proofs. Nevertheless, the exposition is sufficiently detailed to make
it clear what is presently known, and to serve as a starting place for
more in-depth study. Where possible, we provide pointers to more
rigorous treatments in the literature. Where we include results that
have only been proved in special cases, we indicate this in the form
of caveats.

There is a much more general form of the functor that takes a Lie algebra
to its envelloping ring.  This is not precisely what you asked, but if it
would be helpful, try looking at my 1992 thesis, Enveloping rings of
universal algebras, University Microfilms, and the paper a bit later in
Algebra Universalis.

Hello,

I am looking for references regarding the interplay between Model =20
Theory and Category Theory. I came across an announcement related to =20
this topic recently, possibly on this list, but I cannot find it =20
anymore. There has been a thread about it on the n-Category caf=E9 a =20
few months ago also. Do you have any other reference? What would be =20
the best place to start?

Thanks in advance,

Jonathan=20=

Hi all,

has anyone come across this situation? I have a 2-category where the
underlying category has a model structure, and the class of equivalences
(from the 2-cat structure) is contained in the weak equivalences. The
class
of weak equivalences admits a bicategory of fractions, and so one can
consider that bicategory as the homotopy 'category' in some sense.

Cheers,

David Roberts

Dear Jonathan:

There will be an upcoming workshop June 19-20 at the CRM (Centre de =20
Recherches Mathematiques) at the University
of Montreal, dedicated to Michael Makkai's 70th birthday, which is =20
exactly on this theme.  Its  local organizers
are Robert Seely and me, along with two model theorists (Bradd Hart =20
and Tommy Kucera), who were students of Makkai.

This was announced on this list some time ago, but a more up-to-date =20
announcement with the official CRM webpage will shortly be made
available from CRM.  I will post information soon.

										=
Cheers,
										=
Phil Scott

Hi David,

This is something I've thought about as well.  If your model category
is a Cat-model category, then by Hovey's general results on enriched
model categories, its homotopy category is automatically enriched over
Ho(Cat), the category of categories and natural-isomorphism-classes of
functors.  A Ho(Cat)-enriched category is like a "bicategory without
coherence," and the question is about lifting that structure to a
coherent bicategory.

However, in this case I believe you can actually always obtain a
strict 2-category equivalent to the bicategory of fractions by just
looking at the full sub-2-category of your model 2-category spanned by
the fibrant and cofibrant objects.  Since any Ho(Cat)-category that is
equivalent (as a Ho(Cat)-category) to a bicategory must itself
underlie a bicategory, you can use this to get a "homotopy bicategory"
without needing the calculus of fractions (which model category theory
is basically designed to avoid).

There is lots of good stuff about Cat-model categories in Steve Lack's
paper "Homotopy-theoretic aspects of 2-monads":
http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0607646.

Best,
Mike

Dear David,

I have written about this sort of thing in the paper

Homotopy-theoretic aspects of 2-monads, Journal of Homotopy and Related
Structures 2:229-260, 2007; also arXiv:math.CT/0607646.

Dear Tony,

I pointed out this fact in my reply (see below) to one of your earlier
questions. In fact you don't need symmetry, and L is automatically strong
monoidal.

Steve Lack.

Dear Tony,

Yes, it is true. More generally, let F-|U:W-->V be a monoidal adunction.

This means that V and W are monoidal categories, F and U are monoidal
functors, monoidal natural transformations 1-->UF and FU-->1 satisfying the
triangle equations.

(A monoidal functor F:V-->W involves maps FX\otimes FY-->F(X\otimes Y)
and I_W-->F(I_V), not necessarily invertible, but satisfying coherence
conditions. In a monoidal adjunction, as above, the monoidal functor F is
necessarily strong, so that the comparison maps are invertible. The
comparison maps for U need not be invertible.)

For a small V-category K and a W-category C we do indeed have an isomorphism
    V-Fun(K,UC) = U(W-Fun(FK,C))
of V-categories. I'll do my best to explain this via ascii.


V-functors from K to UC are in bijection with W-functors from FK to C; this
takes care of the object-part. For V-functors M,N:K-->UC,
the hom-object V-Fun(K,UC)(M,N) is the equalizer of the evident maps
               --->
Pi_k UC(Mk,Nk) ---> Pi_{k,l} [K(k,l), UC(Mk,Nl)]
in V, where the products run over all objects k and l of K.

On the other hand, U(W-Fun(FK,C)(M,N)) is given by the equalizer of
                 -->
U(Pi_k C(Mk,Nk)) --> U Pi_{k,l} [FK(k,l),C(Mk,Nl)]
or equivalently, since U is a left adjoint, the equalizer of
               -->
Pi_k UC(Mk,Nk) --> Pi_{k,l} U[FK(k,l),C(Mk,Nl)]

So we are now left to prove

Lemma: U[FX,Y]=[X,UY], for X in V and Y in W.
Proof:

V(Z,U[FX,Y]) = W(FZ,[FX,Y]) = W(FZ\otimes FX,Y) = W(F(Z\otimes X),Y)
             = V(Z\otimes X,UY) = V(Z,[X,UY])

naturally in Z and so U[FX,Y]=[X,UY] as required.

Regards,

Steve Lack.

CALCO brings together researchers and practitioners to exchange new
results about both traditional and emerging uses of algebras and =20
coalgebras
in computer science.

This is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces
and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic =20
Methods
in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development
Techniques). The first and second CALCO conferences took place 2005 in
Swansea, Wales (http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/calco/index.php), and 2007 in
Bergen, Norway (http://www.ii.uib.no/calco07/).
The second event will take place September 2009 in Udine, Italy.

CALCO 2009 will be preceded by two events on September 6, 2009.

  * CALCO-jnr - a CALCO Young Researchers Workshop dedicated to
    presentations by PhD students and by those who completed
    their doctoral studies within the past few years.

  * CALCO Tools Day - providing the opportunity to give
    system demonstrations. See below for more information.

There are separate submission procedures for the CALCO main conference,
CALCO-jnr and CALCO Tools Day, respectively.

Invited Speakers
------------------
Mai Gehrke (Nijmegen, NL)
Conor McBride (Strathclyde, UK)
Prakash Panangaden (McGill, Canada)
Gordon Plotkin (Edinburgh, UK)

Topics of Interest
------------------
We invite submissions of technical papers that report results of
theoretical work on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the
way these results can support methods and techniques for software
development, as well as experience with the transfer of resulting
technologies into industrial practice. We encourage submissions in
topics included or related to those in the lists below.

  * Abstract models and logics
    - Automata and languages,
    - Categorical semantics,
    - Modal logics,
    - Relational systems,
    - Graph transformation,
    - Term rewriting,
    - Adhesive categories

  * Specialised models and calculi
    - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems,
    - Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed,
      mobile, and context-aware computing,
    - General systems theory and computational models
      (chemical, biological, etc)

  * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
    - Abstract data types,
    - Inductive and coinductive methods,
    - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation),
    - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques,
    - Semantics of programming languages

  * System specification and verification
    - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification,
    - Formal testing and quality assurance,
    - Validation and verification,
    - Generative programming and model-driven development,
    - Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
      hardware/middleware/architectures,
    - Process algebra


Submission Guidelines
---------------------
Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Experience papers
are welcome, but they must clearly present general lessons learned
that would be of interest and benefit to a broad audience of both
researchers and practitioners. As in 2005 and 2007, it is planned to =20
publish
the proceedings in the Springer LNCS series. Final papers will be
no more than 15 pages long in the format specified by Springer. It
is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length
(see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). Submissions that
are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Proofs omitted due
to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.
Both an abstract and the full paper must be submitted by their =20
respective
submission deadlines.

A special issue of the new high-quality open access journal Logical
Methods in Computer Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), consisting of
extended versions of selected papers will be produced after the =20
conference
if there are enough good papers that can be extended and revised to the
standards of this journal.

for its
outstanding wine and culinary traditions.


CALCO Tools Day
---------------
A special day at CALCO'09 is dedicated to tools based on algebraic
and coalgebraic principles. These include systems/prototypes/tools
developed specifically for design, checking, execution, and verification
of (co)algebraic specifications, but also tools targeting different
application domains but making core or interesting use of (co)algebraic
techniques. Tool submissions should be no longer than 5 pages in the
LNCS format; the accepted tool papers will be included in the final
LNCS proceedings of the conference.  The tools should be available on
the web for download and evaluation. Each submission will be evaluated
by at least three reviewers; one or more of the reviewers will be asked
to download and run the tool. At least one of the authors of each tool
paper must attend the conference to demo the tool.
Submissions by e-mail to grosu@cs.uiuc.edu.

Does anybody know a reference for the following (very easy) result?

Let C and D be categories, and let F:C-->D and G:D-->C be functors.

If (c,theta) is an initial algebra for GF, then (Fc, F theta) is an initi=
al algebra for FG.

thanks,
Paul

Dear Paul,

I proved a "topical" version of this as Propn 2.3.7 in my "Topical
Categories of Domains" (1999).

"Topical" here means working in the 2-category of Grothendieck
toposes and geometric morphisms instead of that of categories and
functors. Instead of objects of a category and morphisms between
them, it deals with points of a topos and natural transformations
between them. (Note that I use the term "F-structures" instead of "F-
algebras".)

In this setting there are some subtleties of interpretation. An
initial F-structure is defined as a point of the classifying topos [F-
struct] for F-structures that is initial amongst all the generalized
points - making [F-struct] a local topos. Nonetheless, the argument
is essentially one that you might use with categories and functors.

I remarked that my results were familiar from the category context as
set out in Freyd's 1991 paper "Algebraically complete categories". I
cannot remember if your result on FG-algebras and GF-algebras was in
Freyd.

All the best,

Steve.

                     Logic, Language and Information
                  ESSLLI 2009 <http://esslli2009.labri.fr/>
                     July 20 - 31, 2009 in Bordeaux
*******************************************************************

ORGANIZERS:

Michel Parigot (CNRS, Univ. Paris 7, France)
Lutz Strassburger (INRIA Saclay-IdF, France)


DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP:

The topic of this workshop is the application of algebraic, geometric,
and combinatorial methods in proof theory. In recent years many
researchers have proposed approaches to understand and reduce
"syntactic bureaucracy" in the presentation of proofs. Examples are
proof nets, atomic flows, new deductive systems based on deep
inference, and new algebraic semantics for proofs. These efforts have
also led to new methods of proof normalisation and new results in
proof complexity.

The workshop is relevant to a wide range of people. The list of topics
includes among others: algebraic semantics of proofs, game semantics,
proof nets, deep inference, tableaux systems, category theory,
deduction modulo, cut elimination, complexity theory, etc.

The goal of the workshop is twofold: first, to bring together
researchers from various fields who share the interest of
understanding and dealing with structural properties of proofs and
second, to provide an opportunity for PhD students and researchers to
present and discuss their work with colleagues who work in the broad
subject areas that are represented at ESSLLI.

The workshop is intended to be a sequel of the ICALP-workshop SD05 in
Lisbon 2005 <http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/ag/w/sd05>.


SUBMISSION DETAILS:

Contributions can be regular papers, but also work in progress,
programmatic/position papers or tutorials.  Submissions should be
formatted with the LNCS LaTeX style, take between two and fifteen
pages and allow the committee to assess their merits with reasonable
effort. The length limit can be relaxed for the versions that will be
presented at the workshop, depending on the total bulk of the accepted
contributions.

Please use the SD'09 submission page=20
<http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsd09>
handled by the EasyChair conference system, to submit papers.

The accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published by=20
ESSLLI.  One author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop in=20
order to present the paper.


WORKSHOP FORMAT:

The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants.
It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive
days in the first week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 or 3 slots for paper
presentation and discussion per session. On the first day the workshop
organizers will give an introduction to the topic.


INVITED SPEAKER:

Fran=E7ois Lamarche (LORIA, Nancy)

A symmetric monoidal functor F:C->D is closed if the morphism
  c_D(Phi_{x -o y, x}^{-1} o F(c_C^{-1}(1_{x -o y}))):F(x -o y) -> F(x) -o F(y)
is an isomorphism, where x,y in C,
  Phi_{x,y}:F(x) tensor F(y) -> F(x tensor y)
and c_C and c_D are currying in C, D.

Could someone give me the definition of a symmetric monoidal closed
natural transformation?  I thought it would be a simple commuting
diagram like the one involving Phi, but one of the arrows goes the
wrong way.

Thanks to all those who responded, letting me know that precisely
because of the arrow going the "wrong" way, it only makes sense to
talk about symmetric monoidal closed natural isomorphisms.

[Note from moderator: this may have been sent incorrectly earlier,
apologies if you have received it twice.]

Dear Category group,

      Here is a definition of Cantor dust ....
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set.

      My question is from a constructivist viewpoint does this set really
exist and if so, why?

Very kind regards,

Vasili

I don't think it exists from a constructivist viewpoint because it has to be
constructed in a finite number of steps.

Yes, it exists. In fact, it is a continuous image of 2^N.
It is Bishop compact, fan-like and compact overt (choose your taste of

I would  like to raise an objection  to using the term `2-group' as on =
nlab and elsehere since for the group theorists this has a specialised =
meaning: See the following wiki entry, especially the first 2 words:=20

"In mathematics, given a prime number p, a p-group is a periodic group =
in which each element has a power of p as its order. That is, for each =
element g of the group, there exists a nonnegative integer n such that g =
to the power pn is equal to the identity element. Such groups are also =
called primary."=20

I feel we should try to  avoid and even  to reduce  confusion, =
especially as there are claims that crossed modules, for example, can be =
thought of as `2-dimensional groups' (I agree with this, of course!); =
there are nice crossed modules M \to P in which M and P are 2-groups in =
the group theoretic sense!=20

My favourite example is=20

\mu: Z_2 \times Z_2 \to Z_4=20

in which Z_4 acts by the twist (of order 2), and \mu maps each factor =
Z_2 injectively into Z_4. This crossed module has non trivial =
k-invariant. I think Johannes Huebschmann first observed this.=20

So an example oriented approach to crossed modules could well need the =
term p-group in its standard group theoretic usage. Some examples of =
finite crossed modules are in=20

R. Brown and C.D. Wensley, `Computation and homotopical applications
of induced crossed modules', J. Symbolic Computation 35 (2003)
59-72.

However I think one can be happy with the well established term =
2-groupoid.=20

I would just like this point to be discussed: terminology is important, =
and confusing an established  use might raise hackles unnecessarily.=20

       17th Workshop on Foundational Methods in Computer Science
                 University of British Columbia, VANCOUVER, Canada
                         MAY 28th - 31st, 2009

                           FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

                                 * * *

The Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia
in cooperation with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences
is hosting the Foundational Methods in Computer Science workshop
on May 28th - 31st, 2009, on the University of British Columbia
Campus in Vancouver, Canada

The workshop is an annual informal meeting intended to bring together
researchers in mathematics and computer science. There is a focus on
the application of category theory in computer science. However, all
those who are interested in category theory or computer science are
welcome to attend.

There will be a welcoming reception on the evening of Thursday May 28. The
scientific program starts on May 29, and consists of a day of tutorials
aimed at students and newcomers to category theory, as well as a day and
a half of research talks. The meeting ends at mid-day on May 31.

Research talks

There will be some invited presentations, but the majority of the
talks are solicited from the participants. If you wish to give a talk
please send a title and abstract to johnm@math.ubc.ca. Time
slots are limited, so please respond early if you would like to be
considered for a talk.

Graduate student participation is particularly encouraged at FMCS.

Accommodations

A block of rooms has been reserved for participants at Gage Towers on the
UBC campus.

Registration

If you would like to come to the meeting or will come to the meeting
please send a brief email to johnm@math.ubc.ca with the words "would like

i.e. a well-defined algorithm exists to construct Cantor dust but the Cantor
dust cannot be constructed/built from the algorithm in a finite number of
steps. Hence, Cantor dust represents potential infinity rather than actual
infinity. This problem has nagged at me for a while.

It is in Section 5 of

Peter Freyd
Remarks on Algebraically Compact Categories, LMS LNS 177, 1992.

(modulo initial invariant = initial algebra).

The full dinaturality of initial algebra delivery (as a diagram of
functors) is in Section 4 of

Adam Eppendahl
Coalgebra-to-algebra Morphisms, ENTCS 29, 1999.

where it is seen to follow from the lemma:

If p is a coalgebra for GF and s is an algebra for FG, then morphisms
from Fp to s correspond one-for-one to morphisms from p to Gs (even
without an adjunction between G and F).

It seems that what you are describing is usually called finitism.

Bill, if you mean this literally then you don't accept the existence of
the set N of natural numbers either.  If that's the case then for you it
is very reasonable to reject the Cantor set K as well, e.g. because
you're a finitist as Bas Spitters suggests.

However if you're ok with the idea of a natural numbers object N in a
topos, defined as an initial algebra for the functor F(X) = X+1, then
you would need to draw a fairly fine line to reject as nonconstructive a
Cantor set object K in a topos, defined as a final coalgebra for the
functor F(X) = 2X (~ X+X, 2 being 1+1 in a topos).

 From this standpoint the existence of a Cantor set object is more
plausible than a continuum object rather than less because more is
needed.  If you go with the double-induction approach of Pavlovic and
Pratt, where the functor is F(X) = NX (~ X+X+X+...) then the topos needs
a natural numbers object.  If instead you go with Freyd's
single-induction approach of connecting up (eliminating the gap between)
the two halves of K+K, as preferred e.g. by Tom Leinster, then the topos
needs structure sufficient tfor such gluing.

I'm not aware of any reason why a topos with a Cantor set object K has
to also have a natural number object N, though I'm not enough of a topos
hacker myself to know how to produce one with K but without N (but would
be happy to learn).  Does such a topos exist in nature?  And what can be
said of the free topos with Cantor set object?

That the first 2 words are "In mathematics" rather than
"In group theory, a branch of mathematics," means nothing.
It's not like the Wikipedians had a discussion about it
and determined that p-groups appear throughout mathematics.

You do raise a good point, though.  The term '2-group' is a special case
of both 'p-group' and 'n-group', and these mean very different things.

I wouldn't want to give up 'n-group', so I find '2-group' appropriate
when (as on the n-Category Lab) one is discussing n-groups as well.
But in your example about the structure of finite crossed modules,
one can simply say 'crossed module', making a note that some literature
calls a crossed module a '2-group' (or even 'strict 2-group').

>"[...] Such groups are also called primary."
>there are claims that crossed modules, for example, can be thought of as `2-dimensional groups'

In extreme cases, these show the way: both 'p-group' and 'n-group'
are abbreviations, for 'p-primary group' and 'n-dimensional higher group'.
So one can always use the full name or specify which usage one's paper follows.
