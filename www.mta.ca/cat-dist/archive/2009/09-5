The following preprint is available;

Limits in symmetric cubical categories
(On weak cubical categories, II)
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 568 (2009).  (25 pages)
    http://www.dima.unige.it/~grandis/CCat2.pdf  (ps)

Abstract. Weak symmetric cubical categories are equipped with
an action of the n-dimensional symmetric group on the n-dimensional
component; this action, besides simplifying the coherence conditions,
yields a *symmetric* monoidal closed structure and one path functor.
As a consequence, we have a clear notion of higher cubical
transformations of symmetric cubical functors (which is not the case
in the non-symmetric setting).

    Here we deal with symmetric cubical limits, showing that they can be
constructed from symmetric cubical products, equalisers and tabulators.
Weak double categories are a cubical truncation of the present
structures;
double limits are compared with the cubical ones.

With best wishes

Marco Grandis

Dear Friends and Colleagues

On p. 331 of

Magnus-Karras-Solitar, Combinatorial group theory

there is a hint at an unpublished
manuscript of R. Lyndon [1955] containing an example of a Lie
algebra over an integral domain
for which the statement of the PBW theorem is not true.
I did not find this example in the literature
not did I find any other hint at it.
Does anybody know anything about it?



Many thanks in advance

Johannes

18 PhD Positions in Mathematical Logic (MALOA Network)

The Marie Curie (FP7) Initial Training Network in Mathematical Logic (MALOA) is
a network with 8 Full Partners (Leeds (coordinator), Manchester, Oxford, Lyon
(Lyon 1 and Lyon ENS), Paris (UPD), Muenster, Munich, Prague) and 3 Associated
Partners (UEA, BT, Onera). Contract negotiations are still not concluded, so
funding is nor absolutely confirmed, but it is expected to start on 1 October
2009, and run for 4 years. It will fund 18 PhD students and 20 short-term
visitors (at least 3 months). All the full partners expect to make appointments
for October 2009.

For more information, seee http://www.logique.jussieu.fr/MALOA/ or contact
Dugald Macpherson (the coordinator, h.d.macpherson@leeds.ac.uk) or the
Scientist-in-Charge at the relevant partner.

It is not entirely clear what the PBW theorem is supposed to say over an
arbitrary ring.  Cartan-Eilenberg prove that if g is a K-free Lie algebra
(K is an arbitrary ring with 1), then the enveloping algebra is K-free and
on the same sort of basis as when K is a field (assume the basis is
ordered, then you can take the set of increasing sequences as the basis of
g^e).  Although they don't, it is simple to show that if g is
K-projective, so is g^e, although the idea of a basis is no longer
meaningful.  If g is an arbitrary K-Lie algebra, then I have no idea what
a PBW theorem could say.

Dear Michael

Thank you for your message.

My message was perhaps a bit cryptic.
By statement of the PBW theorem I mean that,
essentially, relative to the PBW filtration of the
universal algebra UL of the Lie algebra L, the
canonical algebra morphism from the symmetric algebra SL
to the associated graded object E^0(UL) is an isomorphism.
This then implies that the canonical map
from L to UL is injective.

More precisely: The universal algebra UL and the symmetric algebra SL both
acquire filtered cocommutative coalgebra structures,
and the canonical morphism
SL --> E^0(UL)
is one of Hopf algebras. One way to make precise the statement of the PBW
theorem is to require the existence of an isomorphism
UL --> SL of filtered coalgebras such that the
associated graded morphism
E^0(UL) --> SL
is the inverse to the canonical morphism
SL --> E^0(UL).

Certainly the freeness of the Lie algebra is enough to guarantee
the statement of the PBW theorem.
More generally, L projective as a module over the ground ring
still suffices I guess.
Indeed, the arguments you give in Subsection 5.3 of your 1996 JPAA algebra
paper imply this.

Best regards

Johannes

Here's a question about elementary (naive, finitist) probability.
The proper, self-dual axioms for elementary probability are presumably

  P(0) = 0
  P(X) = 1
  P(A u B) + P(A n B) = P(A) + P(B)

P's domain is a boolean algebra.  P's codomain is [0,1].
What kind of algebraic structure is [0,1] in this case?

What can we prove from this theory?  The best I can think of is inclusion /
exclusion:

  P(A u B u C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A n B) - P(A n C) - P(B n C) + P(A n
B n C)
  P(A n B n C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A u B) - P(A u C) - P(B u C) + P(A u
B u C)

Thanks,

David

Annual Meeting (at RMIT. Melbourne) about a categorical approach to
probability theory.

In light of the recent discussion here about
the "horizontal line notation", I've returned
to the introduction to map objects in L. & S.,
_Conceptual Mathematics_.  This statement is
in the rectangle at the top of page 314.

( Script.ChangeFont Courier8 )

     T   e                 X ----> Y
T x Y  ----> Y  induces  -------------
                         T x X ----> Y

Evaluation map e induces a "correspondence".

Is this horizontal line an implication or
an equivalence or a map or a bijection?

"Induces" seems plausible but exactly what
is meant?

Thanks,          ... Peter E.

Dear David,

On structure: Domain L (say) just needs to be distributive lattice - not
Boolean algebra.

The axiom P(top) = 1 looks an obvious dual to P(bottom) = 0, but there's
a lot to be gained from considering P with codomain [0,infinity] and
forgetting P(top) = 1.

Maps P: L -> [0,infinity] satisfying P(0) = 0 and the third (modular)
law are called valuations - I believe this dates back to Birkhoff's book
on lattice theory. In the case where L is a frame (complete lattice,
with binary meet distributing over all joins) and P is Scott continuous,
P is called a continuous valuation. These have been studied in domain
theory (Jones, Plotkin: probabilistic power domain) and general locales
(including by Heckmann, by Coquand and Spitters and by myself).

More generally, the domain of P can fruitfully be any commutative monoid
M. There is a universal valuation L -> M(L) in this generalized sense,
with M(L) got by adjoining finite monoid structure to L and forcing the
two laws.

Coquand and Spitter cite an interesting construction of M(L) by Horn and
Tarski. Let L* be the set of finite lists over L, and define a preorder
on L* by

  [x_i]_{1 in I} <= [y_j]_{j in J}

if for every natural number k,

  \/{x_K | K subseteq I, |K| = k} <= \/{y_K' | K' subseteq J, |K'| = k}

where x_K = /\{x_i | i in K} etc.

Then M(L) is isomorphic to L*/(equ reln corresponding to <=).

The relations holding in M(L) are what can be proved from the theory.
You give a ternary inclusion-and-exclusion for P(A u B u C). If you
bring all the negative terms from right to left, it will still hold in
M(L), and can be generalized from ternary to n-ary. I think you will get
the dual (for P(A n B n C)) by considering L^op.

Another interesting relation, which can be used in proving the
Horn-Tarski result, is this:

   Sigma_{i = 0}^{n-1} x_i
      = Sigma_{k = 1}^{m} \/{x_I | I subseteq {0, ..., n-1}, |I| = k}

Hi all categorists
=20
Here are other questions i think about and need your help with.
=20
2>
Is there a correspondence in general between TQFTs and state sum models?
If not what restrictions are necessary?
=20
I think there is a correspondence but i am not sure.
If it is=2C what is the correspondence then called?
I am als interested in who discovered or proved it and in which year?
=20
Also=2C do anyone have references about how to actually construct the corre=
spondence both ways?

Best regards

Readers of the list may be interested in the following paper:
L. de Francesco Albasini, N. Sabadini, R.F.C. Walters, The compositional
construction of Markov processes, arXiv:0901.2434v1, 2009.

We believe that the identification of probability theory with measure
theory should be replaced with a theory based
on processes. To do this the theory of processes needs to be developed
categorically.
I have some comments on my web page about such a development.

There should be a correspondence between *extended* TQFTs and state sum
models.

The theory of extended TQFTs is only beginning to be developed, so this
expected correspondence has not yet been proved.  I recommend taking a look
at this paper:

This may depend on what exactly one understands under "state sum models".

The Fukuma-Hosono-Kawai construction of 2d TQFTs from semisimple
algebras has tradionally been called a state sum model description.
Lauda and Pfeiffer have described it at great length in

Lauda-Pfeiffer
State sum construction of two-dimensional open-closed Topological
Quantum Field Theories
http://arxiv.org/abs/math.QA/0602047

When one internalizes these constructions from Vect into a modular
tensor category, one obtains the state-sum-like  construction of 2d
CFT by Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert, a review of which is for instance here

I. Runkel, J. Fjelstad, J. Fuchs, Ch. Schweigert
Topological and conformal field theory as Frobenius algebras
math.CT/0512076.

The Turaev-Viro model for 3d TQFT is also frequently called state sum
model. I don't find the good review of Turaev-Viro that I wanted to
link to right this moment, but googling shows up lots or useful links,
it seems.

Urs

David,

To my mind there are three presentations of a "theory" of probability. Two
arrive at essentially the same theory by somewhat different means; these are
frequentist and Bayesian presentations of "standard" probability theory. The
third comes from a completely different direction: quantum mechanics. i
remember when i first encountered the Dirac presentation of QM and the
interpretation of <a| M |b> as a probability amplitude. My first thought was
-- hang on, doesn't that come with an obligation to prove that this aligns
with (satisfies the axioms of) a theory of probability. In attempting to
work that out for myself, i realized that it didn't; discovered a whole
cottage industry of people who had made a similar observation; and argued to
myself that of the various notions of probability put forward, this one
enjoyed being rigourously employed in physical calculations verified to many
decimal places.

Best wishes,

--greg

http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/general-event/foundational-methods-computer-science-2009

Accommodations may also be reserved from the same page. There are in fact
some rooms still available. Reservations can be cancelled without penalty
until 48 hours before the arrival date so it is to your advantage to book
if there is even a slight possibility that you may attend.

The next announcement will contain a complete list of participants so if
you are not on the current list  and you will or may attend, then please
send email to johnm@math.ubc.ca with subject heading FMCS09 - WILL ATTEND
or FMCS09 - MAY ATTEND.

A schedule of talks will be posted on the website on or about May 20. In
the meantime those who have never attended an FMCS meeting may wish to get
an idea of the range of topics by looking at the talks given in 2008 at
Halifax appearing in http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/fmcs2008/

The conference begins with a reception at 6pm on Thursday May 28th in the
Ruth Blair room at Gage Towers on the University of British Columbia
campus and ends at 1pm on Sunday May 31st. On May 29th there will be
tutorials given by Ernie Manes(University of Massachusetts), Vaughan
Pratt(Stanford University) and Pieter Hofstra(University of Ottawa). This
will be followed by a day and a half of research talks by some of the
participants listed below. There is still room for more participants and
for a few more talks so if you would like to speak please let me know by
May 18th before the program is posted.

on May 28th - 31st, 2009, on the University of British Columbia
Campus in Vancouver, Canada

The workshop is an annual informal meeting intended to bring together
researchers in mathematics and computer science. There is a focus
on the application of category theory in computer science. However, all
those who are interested in category theory or computer science are
welcome to attend.

The meeting begins with a reception at 6pm in the Ruth Blair room
in Walter Gage Towers on the UBC campus on Thursday May 28, 2009.
The scientific program starts on May 29, and consists of a day of
tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to category theory, as well as a
day and a half of research talks. The meeting ends at mid-day on May 31.

Research talks

There will be some invited presentations, but the majority of the
talks are solicited from the participants. If you wish to give a talk
please send a title and abstract to johnm@math.ubc.ca. Time slots are
limited, so please register early if you would like to be considered for a
talk.

Graduate student participation is particularly encouraged at FMCS.

2010 FEDERATED LOGIC CONFERENCE (FLoC'10)

  Edinburgh, Scotland, U.K.
  July 9-21, 2010
  http://www.floc-conference.org

* In 1996, as part of its Special Year on Logic and Algorithms, DIMACS hosted
  the first Federated Logic Conference (FLoC). It was modeled after the
  successful Federated Computer Research Conference (FCRC), and synergetically
  brought together conferences that apply logic to computer science.  The
  second Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'99) was held in Trento, Italy,
  in 1999, the third (FLoC'02) was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2002, and
  the fourth (FLoC'06) was held in Seattle, Washington, USA.

* We are pleased to announce the fifth Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'10)
  to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland, U.K. (www.edinburgh.org), in July 2010,
  at the School of Informatics at University of Edinburgh (www.inf.ed.ac.uk).

* The following conferences will participate in FLoC:
  Int'l Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV)
  Int'l Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP)
  Int'l Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR)
  Int'l Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP)
  IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)
  Int'l Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA)
  Int'l Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT)

* Pre-conference workshops will be held on July 9-10.  ITP, LICS, RTA, and SAT
  will be held in parallel on July 11-14, to be followed by mid-conference
  workshops on July 14-15. CAV, ICLP, and IJCAR will be held in parallel on
  July 16-19, to be followed by post-conference workshops on July 20-21.
  Plenary events involving all the conferences are planned. There will be
  receptions in the Edinburgh Castle and at the National Galleries of Scotland.

* The call for workshop proposals can be found at the FLoC web page
  (http://www.floc-conference.org). Calls for papers will be issued in the
  near future. For additional information regarding the participating meetings,
  please check the FLoC web page later this summer.

It is a partial algebra with partial operations \wedge, v, +, o, 0, 1
(the order can be written with \wedge, v)

a+b is defined iff a+b =< 1 in R
a o b  is always defined (multiplication)

plenty of strong weak equalities hold.

What is the generalization to categories?

A reminder, a request, and an invitation:

Information about the following meeting may be found on the webpage:
   http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Makkaifest09/

      Models, Logics and Higher-Dimensional Categories
         A tribute to the work of Mihaly Makkai

                 18 - 20 June 2009

at Centre de Recherche Math\'ematique (CRM) in Montreal
with a 1-day workshop at McGill on 18 June.

-----------------

If you wish to stay near the CRM for the MakkaiFest, there are two
accommodation options, as given on the meeting webpage.

    http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Makkaifest09/logement_e.php

- First, a *very* small number of rooms are still available at the
Terrasse Royale Hotel at the meeting rate of $CAN 125 per night.  If you
want one of these rooms you should contact Louis Pelletier
<pelletl@CRM.UMontreal.CA> immediately (do NOT contact the hotel
directly if you want the conference rate).  Once the reserved rooms are
all taken, we cannot guarantee there will still be rooms available at
the Terrasse Royale.

- The University residence has simple rooms available for very
reasonable rates.  Check their website - you should make reservations
with them directly. http://www.studioshotel.ca/index.php?lang=en&d=h

------

If you are interested in speaking in the 1-day Workshop on June 18th (at
McGill), please let us know as soon as possible - there are VERY FEW
places available in the program, and at this time we cannot guarantee
all requests can be accommodated.

------

If you intend to attend the meeting banquet, please let one of us (Phil
or Robert) know as soon as possible, so we can inform the restaurant of
the numbers attending.  We have to give them a final number early in
June, and once that has been done, we cannot guarantee latecomers can be
accommodated.  We'd rather not have to disappoint participants.

------

Finally, we encourage you to register (on-line at the meeting webpage)
as soon as possible.

                   Call for Papers (Extended Abstracts)

        6th Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science, FICS 2009
                Coimbra, Portugal, 12-13 September 2009,
                    a satellite workshop of CSL 2009,
                  colocated with PPDP 2009, LOPSTR 2009


                        http://cs.ioc.ee/fics09/

Background

Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer
science and logic by justifying induction and recursive
definitions. The construction and properties of fixed points have been
investigated in many different frameworks such as: design and
implementation of programming languages, program logics,
databases. The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for
researchers to present their results to those members of the computer
science and logic communities who study or apply the theory of fixed
points. Previous workshops where held in Brno (1998, MFCS/CSL
workshop), Paris (2000, LC workshop), Florence (2001, PLI workshop),
Copenhagen (2002, LICS (FLoC) workshop), Warsaw (2003, ETAPS workshop).

Topics include, but are not restricted to:

    * categorical, metric and ordered fixed point models
    * fixed points in algebra and coalgebra
    * fixed points in languages and automata
    * fixed points in programming language semantics
    * the mu-calculus and fixed points in modal logic
    * fixed points in process algebras and process calculi
    * fixed points in the lambda-calculus, =

         functional programming and type theory
    * fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits
    * fixed points in logic programming and theorem proving
    * finite model theory, descriptive complexity theory, =

         fixed points in databases

Hello,

      I know that some Lawvere papers are available on TAC, but is there a
list of all Lawvere papers online and if so, which URL?

Kind regards,

Vasili

Hi

I have found that there is a fairly straightforward way to generalize
the notion of enrichment over a monoidal category to enrichment over a
monoidal bicategory.  Namely, a "bicategory enriched over a monoidal
bicategory V" consists of the following:

1) a collection of "objects" A, B, C,...

2) for any pair of objects A,B, an object in V called hom(A,B)

3) for any triple of objects A,B,C a morphism in V called composition:
hom(A,B) tensor hom(B,C) -> hom(A,C)
where "tensor" is the tensor product in V.

4) for any object A a morphism in V called identity: I_A -> hom(A,A)

5) for any quadruple of objects A,B,C,D a 2-isomorphism in V called
the associator, which does the obvious thing.

plus left and right unitors, and so on with all the axioms closely
following those of the definition of a bicategory.

I am looking to be pointed in the right direction in the literature.
Can anyone help?  I am aware of the fc-multicategories by Leinster and
earlier work by Walters, but those do not seem to use the monoidal
structure to enrich as I want.

Best,
Alex Hoffnung

Hi Robert,

     I should have said that I am looking for one paper on "variable sets"
and another on "adjoints", i.e. Lawvere adjoint revelation. I would like
soft copy.

Kind regards,

Vasili

I recently announced a Research Fellowship at Birmingham. Its aim is to
apply techniques of geometric logic to the topos approaches to quantum
theory (Isham and Doering at Imperial, Landsman's group at Nijmegen).

The job is now posted online at Birmingham, application deadline 10th
June 2009. Go to

   http://www.hr.bham.ac.uk/jobs/

and search by post number 43408. There will be an advertisement on

   http://www.jobs.ac.uk/

in the next couple of days.

You can also find all that information on my website at

Dear Alex,

A fair amount of the theory of enriched bicategories is
worked out in Steve Lack's PhD thesis "The algebra of
distributive and extensive categories". I don't think there
have been any further attempts to develop the theory to any
serious degree.

Best wishes,

Richard

For those interested in old stuff, I mention the new internet site I
have opened.
It contains information on my 50 years research with postings of many
of my publications and online references to others.
It also contains the diapos of my Calais conference in 2008 on
distructures and Schwartz distributions, as well as a long unpublished
paper developing it. The address is

http://pagesperso-orange.fr/ehres

This site complements my joint site with Jean-Paul Vanbremeersch on
our Memory Evolutive Systems

The bicategory of (small categories, profunctors, and natural
transformations), should be equivalent to the 2-category of (presheaf
categories, colimit-preserving functors, and natural transformations).
Has someone proved this?  If so, where?

Thanks!

Hi all categorists

Here is another questions i think about and need your help with.

What does the cohomology H^n(X=3Bcoefficients) classify=2C for X a more gen=
eral object then a group and especially when X is a category?
I know that the case X=3Dgroup gives n-torsors.

And how come that the classification is independant of the coefficients?

Dear Alex,

As you say, it is not hard to define bicategories enriched in a monoidal
bicategory; in fact the only hard thing is saying what a monoidal bicategory
is. As you also point out, these are quite different to categories enriched
in a bicategory, in the sense of Walters. The latter are still "strict"
structures; indeed they are categorical rather than 2-categorical, so there
is no room for any non-strictness.

Benabou [Introduction to bicategories, SLN 47] defined a polyad in a
bicategory B to be a set X equipped with a morphism of bicategories
X_ch-->B, where X_ch is the bicategory with object-set X and with all
hom-categories terminal. This is exactly what Walters later called a
B-enriched category, and used in his study of sheaves. (Benabou gave
categories enriched in a monoidal category as an example of polyads, but did
not explicitly suggest that polyads were a sort of enriched category.)

Gordon, Power, and Street [Coherence for tricategories, AMS Memoirs]
considered the next dimension up. For a tricategory T, they called a
morphism of tricategories X_ch-->T a T-category, although did not go on to
use this notion in any way. The case where T has one object is exactly
the situation you discuss.

There is a certain amount of flabbiness in this notion of T-categories,
coming, for example, from the use of not necessarily normal homomorphisms.
A tighter, more explicit definition of bicategories enriched in monoidal
bicategories was given by Sean Carmody in his 1995 Cambridge thesis. They
also appeared in my thesis the following year.

More recently, there has been quite a lot of work done on the one-object
case: pseudomonoids in Gray-monoids, or equivalently pseudomonads in
Gray-categories.

Hope this helps.

Steve Lack.

A new paper of mine is available on the Arxiv:

http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0905.2665

*Abstract:* We employ the notions of `sequential function' and
`interrogation' (dialogue) in order to define new partial combinatory
algebra structures on sets of functions. These structures are analyzed
using J. Longley's preorder-enriched category of partial combinatory
algebras and decidable applicative structures.We also investigate total
combinatory algebras of partial functions. One of the results is, that
every realizability topos is a quotient of a realizability topos on a
total combinatory algebra.

Group cohomology also classifies crossed extensions:

Huebschmann, Johannes
Crossed $n$-fold extensions of groups and cohomology.
Comment. Math. Helv. 55 (1980), no. 2, 302--313.=20

There is a similar approach for cohomology of categories in:

Baues, Hans-Joachim(D-MPI); Minian, Elias Gabriel(D-MPI)
Track extensions of categories and cohomology. (English summary)
$K$-Theory 23 (2001), no. 1, 1--13.=20

The cases n =3D 0, 1, 2, 3 were known before, see references therein.

Best,

Dear Categorists -

Andrei Rodin pointed out this paper by Charles Wells:

http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/pdf/sketch.pdf

I took a look.  In section 4.1 it mentions that people have given a finite
limits sketch for cartesian closed categories.  I'm curious about how this
works,  Unfortunately the list of references given here is quite long.  Can
anyone help me find a reference on a sketch for CCC's?

Best,
jb

Dear colleagues,

The deadline for the submission of papers to the special issue of
Information and Computation on Intuitionistic Modal Logics and
Applications is fast approaching (31st May).

Please see the CFP below, and forward it to other interested colleagues. If
you'd like to submit a paper, but don't think you can make the deadline,
please write to us with your title and preliminary abstract and we can have
(some!)  flexibility.


 Best regards,
 Brigitte & Valeria

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Call for Papers

Special Issue of Information and Computation on
Intuitionistic Modal Logics and Applications (IMLA)

Guest Editors: Valeria de Paiva, Brigitte  Pientka and Aleks Nanevski

Submission deadline: 31. May, 2009

Constructive modal logics and type theories are of increasing
foundational and practical relevance in computer science. Applications are
in type disciplines for programming languages, and meta-logics for reasoning
about a variety of computational phenomena.
Theoretical and methodological issues center around the question of how the
proof-theoretic strengths of constructive logics can best be combined with
the model-theoretic strengths of modal logics. Practical issues center
around the question of which modal connectives with associated laws or proof
rules capture computational phenomena accurately and at the right level of
abstraction and how to implement these efficiently.

There have been a series of   LICS-affiliated workshops devoted to the
theme. The first one was held as part of FLoC1999, Trento, Italy, the second
was part  of FLoC2002, Copenhagen, Denmark, the third was associated with
LiCS2005, Chicago, USA and the last one was associated with LICS 2008 in
Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Two special issues of journals on the theme have
already appeared,  a Mathematical Structures in Computer Science volume
edited by Matt Fairtlough, Michael Mendler and Eugenio Moggi (Modalities in
type theory) in 2001, and a special
issue of  the Journal of Logic and Computation  in 2004
(Intuitionistic Modal Logics and Application, eds. Valeria de Paiva, R. Gore
ad M. Mendler).

We are hereby soliciting papers for a further special volume
 of Information and Computation, devoted to Intuitionistic Modal
Logics and Applications. We hope to cover the novel applications
presented in the last two workshops, especially applications to
computer security, automated deduction and  computational linguistics, but
also to include work not presented at the workshops. The proposed timeline
 of events is as follows:
* Papers (preferably under 20 pages long) should be submitted by 31st May
 2009
* Reviews will be provided until the end of August 2009 and the volume
should be ready by the end of the Fall.

Topics  of interest include, but are not limited to:

* applications of intuitionistic necessity and possibility
* monads and strong monads
* constructive belief logics and type theories
* applications of constructive modal logic and modal type theory to formal
verification, foundations of security, abstract interpretation, and program
analysis and optimization
* modal types for integration of inductive and co-inductive types,
higher-order abstract syntax, strong functional programming
* models of constructive modal logics such as algebraic, categorical,
Kripke, topological, and realizability interpretations
* notions of proof for constructive modal logics
* extraction of constraints or programs from modal proofs
* proof search methods for constructive modal logics and their
implementations.

Please contact one of the editors (Valeria de Paiva
valeria@cuill.com or  Brigitte Pientka bpientka@cs.mcgill.ca) if
you're not sure that your paper is within the scope of this special
volume. Submissions should be 10 to 20  pages  long and sent in
PostScript or PDF format to one of the editors, before the 31st
May 2009.

I have not kept up with the field very well, but I can recommend these
works:

Peter Johnstone, *Sketches of an Elephant*, Vol. 2, OUP 2003: the chapter on
sketches.  (I am in rural Wisconsin at the moment asnd don't have access to
the book.  If OUP would make its pages available to look at on Amazon I
could have told you the exact page.)

Bagchi and Wells, *Graph Based Logic and Sketches*, here:

http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0809/0809.3023v1.pdf

Also Kinoshita, et al 1997, referred to in GBLS.  There might be relevant
papers since 1993 mentioned in the Elephant, too.

Category people:  If you can suggest other papers that should be included,
let me know soon, and I will revise the sketches paper to include them (and
the ones I mentioned above).

Charles Wells

That is carried out (rather sketchily :)) on page 48 of Graph Based Logic
and Sketches by Bagchi and Wells, here:

http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0809/0809.3023v1.pdf

This post

http://sixwingedseraph.wordpress.com/2009/05/08/turning-definitions-into-mathematical-objects/

is the first of a projected series to explain the Bagchi-Wells paper in a
more how-to-think-about-it style.

I am guessing that the crucial statement that makes this work is the
standard fact that if a category A admits small colimits, then there
is an equivalence of categories

  Funct^cocont(PSh(C), A)  = Funct(C,A) .

In the textbook literature one can find this for instance as corollary
2.7.4, page 63 of Kashiwara-Schapira's "Categories and Sheaves".

It may be noteworthy that this statement is known to generalize from
categories to (oo,1)-categories, for instance as given in theorem
5.1.5.6 of Lurie's "Higher Topos Theory".

Colimit preserving functors between "presentable (oo,1)-categories",
i.e between localizations of (oo,1)-presheaf categories play a major
role in the theory and have some nice applications.

For instance Ben-Zvi/Francis/Nadler have recently shown that "integral
transforms" (of the Fourier-Mukai type and higher generalizations) are
precisely equivalent to colimit preserving functors between the
corresponding presentable (oo,1)-categories.

See around the highlighted box in section 4 here:
http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometric+infinity-function+theory.

Best,
Urs

Dear John,

Barr & Wells "Toposes, Triples and Theories", Section 4.4, give some
examples of LE-sketches (= finite limit sketches) that includes sketches
for the theories of finite limit categories and of elementary toposes.
They don't include CCCs, but you should at least get the idea. The basic
trick (corresponding to the logical one of Freyd's "essentially
algebraic" theories) is to think of these theories as being given
algebraically with some of the operators (e.g. composition, pairing)
being partial and with domain of definition described by equations. You
then introduce those domains of definitions as nodes in the sketch, with
arrows, diagrams and cones constraining them to be finite limits in a
way that corresponds to the equations.

Incidentally, Palmgren and I recently came up with a new logical
characterization of finite limit theories, using a logic of partial
terms. It leads to a neat proof of the initial model theorem. However, I
also believe there is a specific but non-obvious advantage of sketches
over logical syntax in that sketches do not rely on having canonical
finite limits. Suppose a sketch has two distinct nodes a and b, and
manages to constrain them both to be finite limits of the same diagram.
In a model, a and b can be interpreted as different objects (though, of
course, they have to be isomorphic).

Regards,

Steve Vickers.

many thanks, Charles, somehow I forgot that the Elephant is also about Sk=
etches.
I came across this recent paper by Diskin&Wolter

http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zdiskin/Pubs/ACCAT-07.pdf

where the authors propose a version of sketch-based syntax for Computer S=
cience
purposes. The main idea here (as far as I understood the paper) is to use
sketches as arities of predicates. I heard about similar ideas from Rene
Guitart in private conversations (but Rene's approach is algebraic rather=
 than
logical). Looking at GBLS briefly I couldn't immediately grasp if your an=
d
Atish Bagchi's approach to graph-based logic is based on similar ideas or=
 your
approach is quite different. I certainly should read GBLS more carefully =
for
discussing it but I would grateful for a hint.

Dear Andrei,
   Speaking about research programmes,  Makkai's generalized sketches
should definitely be mentioned. An easy introduction can be found in

A Diagrammatic Logic for Object-Oriented Visual Modeling
Zinovy Diskin and Uwe Wolter
DOI Bookmark:	10.1016/j.entcs.2008.10.041

It provides references to Makkai's papers and some other sources, and
briefly describes some history and motivations. You may skip all
sentiments about engineering applications, or do just the opposite --
pay attention to them -- at least, this is what granting agencies
like.

There are two distinctions from Makkai's sketches: a signature of
diagram predicates is a category rather than a set, and semantics is
given in terms of functors into sketches rather than from them.

Makkaifest Workshop
18 June 2009
Burnside Hall, McGill University

[Updated information]

We are pleased to announce the following workshop, held at McGill
University, Mathematics Department, on 18 June 2009, in conjunction
with the Makkaifest being held at CRM, 19-20 June 2009, with an
initial reception at the CRM on 18 June.

This workshop is intended for the participants of the Makkaifest. It
will begin at 9am, in Burnside Hall, McGill University, and will
finish around 5pm, so there will be time to get to the reception at
CRM at 6pm. A provisional schedule of talks appears online:

http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/seminar/mf-wkshop.html

(Not all speakers have confirmed their participation, so please check
the webpage for updated information.)

Information about the weather and maps of the area (showing
Burnside Hall) are given on the same webpage.

The workshop will be an informal affair - there will be no
registration, and no "refreshments" (people can buy their own coffee,
and lunch will be "dutch treat"). The workshop is not officially part
of the Makkaifest at the CRM.

If you are interested in attending the workshop, please let us (Phil
Scott or Robert Seely) know so we can be sure we have a room of
suitable size. The themes of the workshop are those of the Makkaifest
itself, and reflect interests shown by Michael Makkai over his career.

Information about the Makkaifest (19-20 June at CRM) may be found on
the meeting website: http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Makkaifest09/

You can register for that meeting online, and if you plan to attend
the meeting banquet on 19 June, please make sure we know (so we can
inform the restaurant of the correct number).

With the recent question about references for sketch theory in mind,
perhaps now is a good time to ask:

Are the old issues of Diagrammes available anywhere on the web?
Also, although the regular issues of the Cahiers seem to be available at

http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?j=CTGDC,

what about the Supplements, containing the collected work of Charles
Ehresmann,

published around 1982?


Best wishes,

Keith

Dear John,

You ask about a sketch for cartesian closed categories. Have a look at
at the paper "A presentation of topoi as algebraic relative to categories or
graphs (Dubuc-Kelly, J. Alg. 81: 420-433, 1983). This describes something
even tighter: the category of cartesian closed categories is monadic over
the category of graphs.

If you look at the description given in that paper, it clearly contains a
sketch for cartesian closed categories (this depends heavily paper on the
paper Algebres Graphique of Albert Burroni). In fact the Dubuc-Kelly paper
also describes a notion of presentation for finitary monads on Cat; this was
later developed by Kelly and Power into a fully-fledged theory of
presentations for finitary enriched monads on locally finitely preseentable
categories, in their paper " Adjunctions whose counits are coequalizers, and
presentations of finitary enriched monads" (JPAA 89:163-179, 1993).

Regards,

Steve Lack.

our version of sketches is intended for use in software engineering,
not only in computer science. The difference between them is like the
difference between, say, electrical engineering and physics.

Predicate arities may be objects of any a priori chosen good category,
e.g., sketches built in a previous step, but this is not the main
idea. Relation of Makkai's generalized sketches to classical sketches
is, roughly, like relation of a general first-order theory a la Tarski
to a particular family of theories like, e.g., lattice theory. The
former provide a general framework, in which the user can define any
theory she likes. The latter is a family of particular instantiations
of the framework. The fact that this family is expressive enough to
specify any structure is another story.

A first-order signature contains operation and predicate symbols.
Similarly, a generalized sketch signature may contain operation
symbols too (whose arities are In-Out spans). Definitions and some
details can be found in Report referenced as [6] in the paper above.

LCC'09 FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

>>> EXTENDED DEADLINE: JUNE 5

The Tenth International Workshop on Logic and Computational Complexity
(LCC'09, www.cs.indiana.edu/lcc)
will be held in Los Angeles on August 10, 2009, as an affiliated meeting
of LiCS'09 (www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/lics/lics09),
and in conjunction with SAS'09 (sas09.cs.ucdavis.edu).

LCC meetings are aimed at the foundational interconnections between
logic and computational complexity, as present, for example,  in
implicit computational complexity (descriptive and type-theoretic methods);
deductive formalisms as they relate to complexity (e.g. ramification,
weak comprehension, bounded arithmetic, linear logic and resource logics);
complexity aspects of finite model theory and databases;
complexity-mindful program derivation and verification;
computational complexity at higher type; and proof complexity.

The LCC'09 program will consist of invited lectures as well as
contributed papers selected by the program committee.
This year there will be no published proceedings, and work submitted
or published elsewhere is welcome, provided all pertinent information
is disclosed at submission time.  Papers should be written in English,
be accessible to non-specialists, start with a clear statement of the
issues and results, and not exceed 15 pages.

Proposed papers should be uploaded to
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lcc090,
by Friday, June 5, 2009,
with expected notification date of Monday, June 22.
For additional information see www.cs.indiana.edu/lcc,
or email inquiries to lcc@cs.indiana.edu.
Further information about previous LCC meetings can be found at
http://www.cis.syr.edu/~royer/lcc.

Thanks!

And thanks to everyone else for their helpful comments.  I'm behind on
answering my emails.

In this approach, does each pair of objects in a ccc come with a chosen
product and exponential? Are the morphisms of ccc's are required to preserve
these on the nose?

At first I was a bit shocked to hear of a sketch for ccc's, because the
internal hom is contravariant in one variable.  But I guess that as long as
we treat ccc's purely 1-categorically that's no problem.  But then I guess
we pay the price of "undue strictness".  Right?

Best,
jb

Description
The general purpose of the project CHOCO is to investigate
the syntactic, semantic and algebraic aspects of proof theory
in order to integrate concurrency theory in the Curry-Howard
correspondence between proofs and programs.

The interdisciplinary nature of the project between proof theory
and concurrency theory means that candidates from various
scientific horizons are welcome to apply. On the other hand,
we will consider with special interest applications by candidates
with background in one or several of the fields:
- linear logic (proof nets, geometry of interaction)
- semantics (game semantics, vectorial semantics)
- concurrency theory (process calculi, presheaf semantics)
- type theory (realizability, types for process calculi)
- rewriting theory (lambda-calculus, diagrammatic rewriting)
- category theory (categorical algebra, topos theory)
The applicant should hold a PhD or be about to defend
his/her PhD thesis by December 2009.

The postdoc researcher will work within the laboratory PPS
(Preuves, Programmes, Systemes)
     http://www.pps.jussieu.fr
which is internationally recognized as one of the leading
research laboratories in mathematics and computer science,
with its distinctive proof-theoretic culture.

The laboratory PPS is located in Chevaleret, the largest research
community of mathematicians in France. The laboratory PPS
is also part of the Fondation Sciences Mathematiques de Paris.
http://www.sciencesmath-paris.fr

Strong interaction of the postdoc researcher with the partner sites
of the CHOCO project is also expected:
- Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris Nord.
- Laboratoire d'Informatique du Parallelisme, Lyon,
- Laboratoire de Mathematiques de l'Universite de Savoie, Chambery
- Institut de Mathematiques de Luminy, Marseille,
- Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Marseille,
Further information will possibly be made available

That'll teach me to hit Send without proofreading.  I should add that the
copies of Diagrammes at CWRU should be available via interlibrary loan, but
not over the web.

For the moment, I don't think issues of "Diagrammes" are available on
the net, except for Guitart's papers which can be found on his site
http://pagesperso-orange.fr/rene.guitart/index.html

and for a short paper of myself available on my site
http://pagesperso-orange.fr/ehres

For the volumes of "Charles Ehresmann: Oeuvres completes et
commentees" (Supplsements to the "Cahiers" 1980-83), NUMDAM has
promised to post them, but not before several months because they have
too many work ahead. Before that, I intend to publish on my site part
of the "Comments" and "Synopsis" which I added to Charles' works
during the editing of the 7 volumes.

Kind regards
Andree

I skimmed the patent briefly just now, dated 2005.  I was amused to see
Dusko Pavlovic's name on it, I hadn't realized Dusko had become an
inventor (congrats, Dusko).

My first impression was that it's patenting the application of a
category theory technique to the composition of hierarchically organized
software specifications.  It wasn't immediately clear to me which claims
in the patent someone "skilled in the art" wouldn't have come up with
right away given the problem(s) claimed to have been overcome.  Since
simply aggregating things is an obvious technique, the role of the
morphisms in regulating the overlaps in the aggregation is obviously
key.  That of course is far too well known to be patentable itself.
What I couldn't find on a first pass was what problem was overcome by
what clever *and novel* trick.

As with any patent, its viability will depend on how original the
application is.  Any prior art applying it in this way will render it
vulnerable, but if the method is sufficiently novel it may serve its
intended purpose of temporarily (namely until 2025) barring entry of
others to whatever market turns out to have been created by this
application, unless the would-be competitor can come up with a
satisfactory alternative that does not infringe on this patent.
(Imagine a jury wrestling with the question of whether amalgamation as
used in logic and algebra infringes on a patent based on colimits.)

Mathematicians who are philosophically opposed to seeing their ideas put
to use in the business world should either stick to those parts of
mathematics least likely to be of practical use or prepare for the shock
of seeing their ideas used for the benefit of the non-mathematical
public in ways that enrich primarily the "last-mile" people bringing
those ideas to the public.

In the first two decades of the internet, some academics took the
attitude that no one should derive commercial benefit from the internet,
and protested strenuously whenever anyone appeared to be trying to do
so.  That dam burst around 1995, and the purists were run over in the
resulting stampede.

There is no point trying to stand in the way of a similar stampede for
commercial applications of category theory.  Either colimits will turn
out not to be a particularly effective way of assembling software
specifications, in which case the patent will have been a waste of
money, or they will turn out to be of use, in which case the purists
will (hopefully) be run over as they were for the internet.

More importantly from the perspective of mathematics, the latter outcome
will motivate the funding agencies to take category theory more
seriously and steer more support in its direction so it can grow faster
and be even more useful.  This would make category theory a secondary
beneficiary behind the primary "last-mile" beneficiaries, giving it a
more engineering flavour that brings it closer to the standing of
academic electrical engineering and computer science, whose status is
that of secondary beneficiaries of practical applications behind such
primary beneficiaries as Oracle and HP.  This connection with
practicality has not impeded theoretical computer science, which has
done quite well in the reflected glory of usefulness to the public at large.

The biggest risk to which this patent subjects category theory is that
if it fails to benefit its assignee, Kestrel, for want of interest in
its methods, then that outcome might be used in arguments against
raising the funding level for category theory research.  Funding might
then stay at the low level appropriate for truly pure mathematics, pure
in Hardy's sense of having no practical application, just enough to
support the most talented contributors to the subject while encouraging
the rest to apply their enthusiasm for mathematics to areas of greater
public benefit.

Mathematicians wanting to prevent business people from applying
mathematical results to practical problems via the usual protocols of
the business world (e.g. patents) for fear it will somehow impede or
impurify mathematics are like parents wanting to prevent doctors from
disease-proofing their kids via the usual protocols of the medical world
(e.g. vaccination) for fear it will somehow cause autism or turn their
kids into needle-using junkies.  The arguments that there are better
protocols than patents or vaccination are not widely accepted today in
the respective professional communities currently using them, though of
course that sort of thing can change with the advent of new insights and
better methods.

It is certainly to be deplored, but I'm not sure that it's anything new.

"A computer-implemented method and system for" performing calculations
is a common patent; there are even patents on straight-up algorithms.
The U.S. patent office is far too ignorant to judge whether the idea
"would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person
having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains"
(35 U.S.C. 103), which would make the invention unpatentable.

Certainly much of what is in the patent application is obvious,
but perhaps not all of it; were these diagrams of diagrams a new idea?,
or was applying them to computer system specifications a new idea?.
If so, it's too bad if they're published here instead of in a journal.
But actually, that doesn't seem to be what the patent is about;
it spends more time explaining how to calculate colimits of graphs
and repeating the rather obvious 3-option user menu.
There is an interesting theorem about extensions of diagrams;
I trust that it was published in one of the cited journal articles.

As (at least) one of the listed inventors is a reader of the list,
we might hear the other side; I'd be interested.

Yes, that's right on both counts, but see below.

As you say, if you work 1-categorically, you are stuck with undue
strictness. And as you imply, there is an impediment to a fully
2-categorical approach because of the contravariance of the internal hom.
But there is a way around this. You work 2-categorically, but not over the
2-category Cat, but over the 2-category of categories, functors, and natural
_isomorphisms_. (Kelly & co call this 2-category Cat_g, with g presumably
standing for groupoidal, since this is not just enriched in Cat but in
groupoids.) Then the internal hom does indeed become a 2-functor
Cat^2_g-->Cat_g.

Having these invertible 2-cells now allows you to consider pseudomorphisms
of algebras, which preserve structure up to isomorphism, thus alleviating
the problem of undue strictness. It doesn't completely solve it - since we
only have invertible 2-cells, we don't have a notion of lax morphism; or,
more precisely, the notion of lax morphism we get is just that of
pseudomorphism. Similarly, some constructions might not give what we hoped
for. For example, the cotensor C^2 in Cat_g is not the category of arrows in
C, it's the category of invertible arrows in C.

All the best,

Steve.

Interesting comments by Vaughan.  I have not looked at this patent and
have no intention of doing so.  But Charles and I, both in CTCS and in a
paper published in some CS conference proceedings exhibited things like
a sketch for trees of integers as a pushout or amalgamated sum of a sketch
for trees and that for integers by identifying the sort for integers in
the latter with the sort for leaves in the fomer.  I think we have a
triple amalgamation too, something like trees of lists of integers.  So
evidence of prior art certainly exists, if anyone cares.

On the other hand, I for one would welcome serious applications of
category theory in industry.  My former department is hiring in only three
areas: number theory (in which they are truly strong), applied math, and
statistics (in each of which I rather suspect they are truly weak since
they are competing with every g-d university in North America).  I would
just love to shove it in their collective faces that by allowing the
category theory group to wither, they have allowed an important applied
area to disappear.  But no, they would rather be in the rearguard than the
advanced guard.

Wouldn't it be nice to make the same point to NSF which announced
officially in 1993 that there would never again be any funding in category
theory?

Vaughan, I agree with nearly all that you say about how good it would be
if category theory found practical, commercially viable application.
The only thing that I don't understand is why you see patenting it
as a *good* thing, when (as you say) the purpose of a patent is
>temporarily (namely until 2025) barring entry of others

that is, to *prevent* (in part) commercial application.

I can only suppose that this is because patents are one of

along with many other anti-competitive practices.
(Interestingly, software patents are unavailable in much of the world,
so I'm not sure that it really makes sense to call them "usual".)
I know that if *I* ever come up with a commercially viable application (ha!),
I would not wanted to be hobbled by a patent on the relevant mathematics.

Toby, et al,

Unfortunately, the patent game is more subtle than 'is it really new' on
adjudication. To the best of my understanding, the adjudication process over
a disputed claim really has a lot more to do with the depth of the pockets
of the parties involved in the dispute. Discovery and argumentation can
often be drawn out in a manner that those not quite resourced to see through
to the end of the process simply get buried. The organizations and entities
engaged in the IP-game are fully aware of this aspect of the whole
arrangement. While i'm of mixed feelings regarding the overall issue of
intellectual property, the actual motivations and carryings on of those who
do engage in this really are often quite deplorable.

Best wishes,

yes, i stand guilty as accused: we patented colimits. but just the
*hereditary* ones. so if you compute 1+1, you don't owe me anything. but
if you compute 1+(1+0), then expect a letter from my lawyers, the same
ones representing MPAA, RIAA and elsevier.

but those 1s that you are computing with must be software specifications,
ie in the form "spec 1 endspec", or something like that...

in fact i prolly shouldn't be joking about this. patent laws are a deadly
serious symptom.

speaking of diseases, do you know that about 30% of human genome is
patented? most of the potential cancer and parkinson disease genes are
owned by a couple of companies. that means that if i want to test whether
i have some cancer-related gene, i have to go to a lab that has the
monopoly on testing that gene (since they rarely license to others). they
will charge me a monopoly price, and if i want to test 5 genes, i may have
to write to 5 different labs. if i want a second opinion about the test,
whoever gives it to me may be sued. and there is no second test.

the motivation for this statute is that it provides incentives for
research.

in contrast with the genes, mathematics cannot be patented, nor
copyrighted, even according to the current crazy laws. officially and
explicitly not. if you say in a patent application that you have this
extremely original result, which never occurred to anyone else, and you
would like to patent it --- they will reject it. the same with copyright:
if you try to copyright a theorem, it will not work: anyone can cite your
theorem without paying you.

*but* if you write a book, and present pythagora's theorem in it, you will
not only be able to copyright it, but it will actually be almost
impossible for you to distribute your book without copyright it, and
without selling the copyright to a publisher. so anyone who wants to use
your version of pythagoras' theorem has to ask your publisher's
permission.

patents are crazier than copyright --- but maybe not that much crazier.
you cannot patent mathematics, but you can patent "method and apparatus"
for a particular application of pythagoras' theorem. (they always call it
"method and apparatus".) you cannot patent modular exponentiation, nor the
conjecture that inverting it (ie computing the discrete logarithms) is
computationally unfeasible. but you can patent a method and apparatus to
share a public key by exchanging and multiplying two modular exponents.
the essence of your originality argument will rely upon the novel use of
the conjecture that the discrete logarithms are hard to compute, on which
the security of your system is based.

what i just described is the *diffie-hellman* patent of public key
cryptography. it may sound crazy to pure mathematicians, but there is very
little doubt that the diffie-hellman invention changed the world of
cryptography, networks, the web. our banks would work differently without
diffie-hellman. (ironically, it turned out that some british civil
servants working at GCHQ discovered the diffie-hellman discovery 9 years
before diffie and hellman, see http://jya.com/nsam-160.htm but the UK
governement classified it all, and even paid royalties for the
diffie-hellman patent.)

our colimits patent was, of course, not of comparable importance, although
the underlying math was perhaps slightly less obvious. i'll only comment
about it because toby asked. many people in software specification
community (starting with goguen and burstall) thought that colimits were a
good tool for composing sofware specifications. the objects of the
category where you are computing the colimits are theories in some formal
language, and the morphisms are the interpretations that map axioms to
theorems. many people studied that approach, and a couple of tools really
used it. but when you really start building software with such a tool, you
find that the method hampers software reuse and evolution: a colimit
composes your components by cooking them up into a big unreadable
specification. so you find yourself saving the diagram of your colimit all
the time, and trying to relate the content of the colimit spec with its
nodes. (which ironically repeats the first lesson about the colimits: the
colimit is not just the tip of the cocone, but the whole thing.)

anyway, instead of computing the colimits of specs and then building new
diagrams of the resulting unreadable specs to compute even more unreadable
(and unmodifiable!) specs as colimits, we wanted to build a category where
the objects would be diagrams of diagrams of diagrams... of specs, and the
morphisms would be such that each diagram (of diagrams...) would be a
colimit of itself, when externalized. that is what the requirement of a
non-destructive colimit operation amounts to.

what is patented is not that category, but the method to implement and use
it to build and maintain software specs. we did some of implementing and
using, and some of it was fun, but definitely not the shortest way to
building the kind of software that needed to be built.

i don't think that we published anything about this construction. the
patent description was written by the lawyer (a very bright woman, i think
with an MIT PhD, who now runs the world for google). some other things
that we didn't publish were perhaps closer to a mathematical result. but
the purpose of it all was to build software, not to publish mathematical
results.

we just patented it so that all those geneticists have to pay us some day,
or give us some free genetic testing in exchange for hereditary diagrams
;)

Our full account of an application of colimits and limits to improving
upon a standard neural architecture is soon to appear in the journal
Neurocomputing.  In case this interests you, a preprint is obtainable fro=
m

The blurb:

Applying Category Theory to Improve the Performance of a Neural Architect=
ure
Michael J. Healy, Richard D. Olinger, Robert J. Young,
Shawn E. Taylor, Thomas P. Caudell, and Kurt W. Larson

Abstract:

A recently-developed mathematical semantic theory explains the
relationship between
knowledge and its representation in connectionist systems. The semantic
theory
is based upon category theory, the mathematical theory of structure. A
product of its
explanatory capability is a set of principles to guide the design of
future neural architectures
and enhancements to existing designs. We claim that this mathematical
semantic
approach to network design is an effective basis for advancing the state
of the art. We
offer two experiments to support this claim. One of these involves
multispectral imaging
using data from a satellite camera.

One reason a mathematician may want to patent a practical use of his idea is
because if he doesn't do so, someone else can.  If some corporation spent
the money to understand a mathematical construction and then patented its
application, not only does that corporation stand to make a lot of money (on
a construction the corporation was hardly involved with), it can also keep
competitors from using the ideas.  Or, the corporation can "bury it," by
patenting the ideas and then not using them, but still using litigation to
prevent others from putting the ideas to good use.
Once you patent, you control the rights to the intellectual property, and
can make the product more or less widely available.  To me, the patenting of
an application of category theory is not an issue; the problem would be if
someone patented such an application of category theory and then restricted
its use or attempted to make undue amounts of money from it.

Interestingly, software industry is heading in the opposite --
patent-free -- direction. It's called Open source software
development, and it is tremendously popular. There are several
impressive examples, such as the extremely successful Eclipse project
http://www.eclipse.org, (btw, Eclipse is partly based on categorical
ideas that engineers developed/reinvented from scratch).  Another
example is the use of open source software for commercial products by
such giants as IBM. (Of course, building legal foundations for this is
a separate story but somehow they managed it.) I have a feeling
(though i maybe wrong), that patenting is becoming an outdated
enterprise in the internet era.

Aha, and then you'll apply for a position and someone will say
that you violated a patent when you use colimits in your work.

More precisely, AFAIK, copyright effectively applies to the *form* that you

Let us however recall that patenting algorithms is possible in the USA or in
Japan but certainly not in the EU, until now (despite much repeated lobbying
from pharmaceutical and IT companies). Still, the European Patent Office
(EPO) has already accepted tens of thousands of such patents, by cheating
with the law (indeed, the law says that you can't patent an algorithm "as
such", which the EPO interpreted as : you can patent an algorithm as long as
it is part of a "technical mechanism" such as an MP3 player, for instance).

Without even entering into social or economic outcome of "openness" of
results, or so-called innovations (see Maskin's publications for more
information, for instance), I'd like to point out an ethical issue here. Th=
at
is the harm done to a 500-year, or so, social contract between scientists
acknowledging publicly, that is in publications, that they stand on the
shoulders of giants or, with less grandiosity, on other colleagues' results=
.=20

Of course, there is a strong incentive, to say the least, in many instituti=
ons
for the "valorisation" of results. My point is that a strong "openness" (su=
ch
as publications under "creative commons" or release of software under
free/open-source licences) may give a far better valorisation of results th=
an
strong, defensive, appropriation, while being more compliant to centuries of
scientific practice.=20

American patent laws are radically different and more backwards in common
sense than ones say in India. In India you can patent only a process/means
how to do certain thing, not a thing itself, what is more natural, and this
is a main dispute between american industry and various movements in India.

For example, once there is a nuclear energy, one can use it for any thing
which requires energy.
But in american law it is theoretically possible that in times when there
was not  a single nuclear submarine, one registers a patent
for the idea/concept nuclear submarine without
any specific techincal details on construction. Similarly for the concept of
a shoe which charges battery by using the energy disssipated in changing
pressure on the shoe when walking.
In Indian patent law, any specific way to achieve that is patentable.
But somebody else who wishes to independently makes another design
achieving the same function can not be prevented by that patent.

Also in Indian patent law one can not patent existing
natural resources, like species of wild plants, naturally
existing compounds in plants na rocks and alike; and my
understanding is that this hence applies to mathematical facts like number
13 is prime even if before unknown to the mankind.

2nd Interaction and Concurrency Experience (ICE'09)
Structured Interactions


Satellite workshop of CONCUR 2009
31st of August 2009
Bologna, Italy

Homepage: http://ice09.dimi.uniud.it/


-- Invited Speakers --

- Farhad Arbab (CWI)
- Doron Peled (Bar Ilan University)


Interaction and Concurrency Experiences (ICEs) is intended as a series
of international scientific meetings oriented to researchers in
various fields of theoretical computer science. The timeliness and
novelty of these events relies both on the variety of the topics that
will be treated on each event and on the adopted paper selection
mechanism.

Every experience will focus on a different specific topic which
affects several areas of computer science. A thorough scientific
debate among PC and authors of submitted papers will parallel the
reviewing process. After the paper selection phase, papers will be
published on the web and the discussion will be extended to
perspective participants.

-- Scope of ICE'09 --

The general scope is to include theoretical and applied aspects of
interactions and the synchronization mechanisms used among actors of
concurrent/distributed systems. The workshop intends to attract
researchers interested in models, verification, tools, and programming
primitives concerning such structured interactions.

The theme of ICE09 will be structured interactions by which we mean
the class of synchronisations that go beyond the "simple"
point-to-point synchronisations. A few examples of such structured
interactions are: multicast or broadcast synchronisations,
even-notification based interactions, time dependent interactions,
distributed transactions, stateless/statefull interactions.

Not only structured interactions have been studied "in isolation", but
researchers have also considered mutual relations and theoretical
frameworks featuring uniform representations and/or co-existence of
different structured interactions.
As a matter of fact, different structured interactions are typically
required when specifying views of a distributed system or when
considering it at different levels of abstraction. For instance,
multicast or broadcast interactions (desirable at a high level of
abstraction) have to be mapped on more basic kind of interactions like
point-to-point asynchronous synchronisations.

The interest in such interactions is growing due to the recent trend
in providing abstractions that allow one to master the complexity of
distributed systems. Remarkable research lines in this area are the
use of types or behavioural equivalences to guarantee properties of
concurrent/distributed systems (eg., progress properties) or the use
of model-driven approaches in order to achieve correctness "by
construction" (eg., graceful termination), or else the relations among
interactions, mobility and spatial aspects (eg., bigraphs).

-- Topics --

Topics of interest include, but shall not be limited to:
- models, logic and types for structured interactions;
- expressiveness results;
- timed and hybrid interactions;
- verification, analysis and tools;
- programming primitives for structured interactions;
- structured interactions as coordination mechanisms;
- structured interactions inspired by emerging computational models

(systems biology, quantum computing, etc.).

-- Selection Procedure --

The workshop proposes an innovative paper selection mechanism based on
an interactive discussion amongst authors and PC members. As shown by
the past edition of ICE, this considerably improves the quality of the
papers, the reviews and the discussion during the workshop. We
continue by detailing the selection procedure.

After the submission deadline expires, each PC member selects a number
of suitable papers to review before the start of the discussion
phase. At the beginning of the discussion, each submitted paper is
published on a Wiki and associated with a discussion forum whose
access will be restricted to the authors and to all the PC
members. The latter will be able to post comments/questions which the
authors will reply to (authors will obviously have access only to
forums associated with their own papers). Thus, the discussion on
forums (and hence the reviewing process of papers) may be enhanced by
the additional comments of interested PC members.

-- The Public Wiki --

After the notification, the accepted papers will be published on a
public forum, the rationale being to initiate public discussions that
will trigger and stimulate the scientific debate of the workshop. We
argue that this will drive the workshop discussions and let
perspective participants to interact with each other well in advance
with respect to the modus operandi of more traditional events.

-- Submission Guidelines --

Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted to
another conference/workshops with refereed proceedings. Programme
Committee members, barring the co-chairs, may (and indeed are
encouraged) to contribute. Accepted papers must be presented at the
workshop by one of the authors.

There is no specific page limit, but authors should strive for
brevity. Details of the submission mechanism will follow in due
course.

-- Dissemination --

The ICE09 post-proceeding will be published in a novel series:
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science.

- Submission deadline: 5 June 2009
- Reviews due: 26 June 2009
- Discussion: from 29 June to 11 July 2009

Dear Michael and all,

I am unaware of a great deal of the history of category theory in grant
funding.  The NSF declaration is troubling, especially since my colleague=
s
and I so far have had our category-theoretic proposals in cognitive
neuroscience rejected.  Some of the reviewers, though, did seem to find
favor with our use of category theory in relation to their subject; the
problem seems to have been more in other areas.  We haven't given up!

I regret not joining the FMCS crowd at UBC.  Too much work has resulted
from a prior commitment.

Best regards,
Mike

Dear Toby,

The idea of treating specifications as colimits is a few decades old
now. Burstall and Goguen used it in their categorical account of their
specification language Clear, with a specification used to construct a
new theory as colimit of others.

The hierarchical step, diagrams of diagrams, was studied by Catherine
Oriat in her thesis and (I believe) a TCS paper in 2000. My own student
Gillian Hill investigated a variant of this (PhD Thesis 2002; also two
papers with me, 2001, 2006), replacing the category of finite diagrams
over a base category C by the equivalent category of finitely presented
presheaves. Both are finite cocompletions, but a presheaf presentation
by generators and relations comes over neatly as a "configuration by
components and sharing". For obvious reasons the iterated construction
"flattens" back down to the single one (the construction is a KZ-monad
in the 2-category of categories). Gillian also investigated a
multi-level configuration language that maintains the hierarchical
structure without flattening (configurations of configurations of
configurations of ...) and includes cross-level specification morphisms.
However, we did not persevere to work out the categorical semantics of
this, nor did we make a computer implementation.

Regards,

Steve Vickers.

First, patent laws are national laws. But it is generally acknowledged, even
in the most patent-friendly countries, that a patent should protect somethi=
ng
*original*. As long as you have published your idea with a clearly
identifiable date of publication, for instance in a scientific journal, no
one should be able to patent it afterwards (I write "should" because patent
offices are often a bit skimpy).

Secondly, and once again, many countries do not allow patenting mathematical
results. Things are less clear for algorithms.

As a matter of fact, considering the cost of patent registration, the
depositer must expect something... Either to earn money, or to have its
competitors lose money, or (that may be the case for many public institutio=
ns)
to give evidence for "valorisation" of results to public authorities.=20

Except for the last case where patents may, perhaps, not be used to prevent
scientific work, other applications of patents are likely to be problematic
both ethically and economically as far as scientific research is concerned
(think about scientists working in institutions unable to afford royalties =
or
attorney expenses).=20

This is a good example, since if you read Feynman's account
of how he didn't get the patent for that (but did for other things),
you can see how the ideas that he got patents for really *were*
"obvious at the time the invention was made to a person
having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains"
(to quote current law, which may have been different in 1945).
But of course, the patent office had no way of knowing that.

Here's an abbreviated account:

It's a shame if there were new mathematical results
(perhaps, pace Steve Vickers's post, there weren't)
that were published only in a patent application.
Maybe they were too obvious to be worthy of publication,
but then weren't they too obvious to be worthy of a patent?

Of course, you were presumably doing work for hire,
and I'm not trying to blame you for all of this,
but I'm happy when people get outraged about these practices.

While I'm here, some clarifications are my previous posts:
When I first wrote "I'm not sure that it's anything new",
I didn't mean the novelty of the invention in the patent
but instead the practice of patenting such things.
And when I wrote "I would not wanted to be hobbled
by a patent on the relevant mathematics", of course I meant
a patent on implementing the relevant mathematics in software.

We have put a tutorial on symmetric monoidal categories on the arXiv:

http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3010
Categories for the practising physicist (104 pages)
Bob Coecke and Eric Oliver Paquette

It is directed to physicists who unlike mathematical physicists, do not
have a strong background in pure maths.  The target audience are
researchers in quantum foundations and quantum infomation.  The main goal
is to show that monoidal categories are a natural starting point to craft
theories of physics, and that they are closely related to something
physicists are very used to, namely Dirac notation.  Some effort is made
to unpack the definition of a symmetric monoidal category which given its
`size', is just too much to grasp at once.  On the other hand, there is a
very clear physical intuition to monoidal categories which can be easily
grasped by physicists or any other operational scientist.  This tutorial
starts from this operational intuition and gradually converts it on
mathematical substance.  As a consequence, the attempt to convey a story
is more prominent than mathematical rigor.  In our interaction with
quantum foundationalists and quantum informaticians we noticed a great
need for a tutorial of this nature.

We seem to be more excited about patents than categories!  I guess opinions
are cheaper than theorems...

I'd say that citation is the academic form of currency.  Here's a
dictionary:

Academia: Academics rush to publish before their colleagues.
Industry: Companies rush to patent before their competition.

Academia: Academics get quite upset if you use their ideas without citing
them.
Industry: Companies sue you if you use their patents without paying them.

Academia: A generous academic lets you publish his idea (yeah, right).
Industry: A generous businessman lets you profit from his idea (yeah,
right).

Academia: You can publish improvements to someone's basic idea.
Industry: You can patent improvements to someone's basic idea.

So you can see why I find the academic "high horse" attitude towards patents
a bit hypocritical.

BTW, here's a difference between academia and industry, which comes about
because money is more flexible than time:

Academia: An academic *cannot* give you any credit for his existing
publication.
Industry: A company *can* let you profit from its existing patent.

Yes, Steve! And they coined also the idea of so-called "based objects"
that allow to distinguish between parameter specifications and
imported specifications once you are going to develop a fully fledged
theory of parametrized specifications. Ingo Classen worked out this in
more detail in his PhD thesis around 1995 (?) at Technical University
Berlin.

is publishing really the supreme purpose of mathematical results? it is
the main method to get an academic job, but academia itself is not a
purpose of itself.

mathematics and sciences are a good thing in at least two ways:

1) as a form of communication (collaboration) between people, and

2) as a source of benefits (better life, useful technologies)

the imperative of publishing evolved as a part of (1). are the current
publishing practices still serving their original purpose, to help
collaboration? or did we put the cart in front of the horse? does the
publishing scrutiny really improve sciences? (search, web, internet all
arose from largely unpublished results. some great ideas of category
theory did not hurry to get published. and the other way around...)

patenting evolved as a part of (2). it also deviated from its original
purpose, and now mostly hampers social benefits...

can such problems be solved on moral grounds, by saying "patenting is bad,
i won't patent"? some people think it can. both grothendieck and newton
said "publishing is bad, i won't publish". and did anything change? i
somehow don't think that it would change if i joined them.

better methods to solve these problems are sought than abstinence and
moralizing.

re
> It's a shame if there were new mathematical results
> (perhaps, pace Steve Vickers's post, there weren't)

i didn't think that they were research level mathematical results. so i am
impressed that steve vickers enumerates so many publications about them.

in any case, even our tool implementing these results predates the
publications that steve vickers mentions.

> Maybe they were too obvious to be worthy of publication,
> but then weren't they too obvious to be worthy of a patent?

you seem to have missed the main point of my previous post.

i described one of the most important patents in computing: the diffie
hellman key exchange. its mathematical content boils down to the
conjecture that discrete logarithms are computationally hard. this
mathematical content has been obvious to nearly anyone who tried to
compute discrete logarithms.

the point is that

** the novelty of a patent is not in the underlying math. (by law,
mathematics cannot be patented.)

** the novelty of a patent is in the "method and apparatus" extracted from
it. (the intent of a patent is not to protect knowledge, but an
application, a new way to use it.)

(gotta run)

Of course; it's a matter of convenience, not excitement.

Here's what you missed:
Academia: Academics can freely use ideas if they cite them,
 and nobody minds if they come up with idea independently.
Industry: Companies must pay to use patented ideas,
 even if they come up with the idea indpendently,
 at whatever rate (possibly prohibitive) set by the owner of the patent.

i designed two tools which people who built them built on top of
eclipse, and i must admint that i managed to completely miss those
categorical ideas. eclipse is very handy, but some simple class
hierarchies often become unrecognizable in its straitjacket. i am
probably not the only one who would be curious to learn more about

i hope that you are right that it is a good thing that IBM supports

Philip Morris supports the teen culture.

well, I've overstated it a little bit because of the context. What I
actually meant was Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) --  one of the
several top-level projects constituting Eclipse.

The core idea of EMF is that a majority of complex structures called
models can be presented as lax functors m: EC  --> mRel, where EC is
the category freely generated by some graph EM called the Ecore
metamodel, and mRel is bicategory of finite sets and finite
multirelations (spans) between them. However, not every such functor
is a valid model because the metamodel EM is actually a sketch, EC is
the theory generated by EM and m should be a functor preserving the
structure (using Makkai's rather than classical sketches is much more
technically convenient here).

Models are used for code generation, and code is just another model.
For example, a Java program is a morphism p: JC-->mRel with JC being
the theory generated by the Java metamodel sketch JM. So, code
generation would be a case of the  change of base situation if we had
a theory morphism e2j: JC-->EC (generated by a Kleilsi arrow JM-->EC).
The real situation is much more complicated because e2j is a span EC
<-- o --> JC rather than a functor.

This is a rough picture. Metamodels and models appearing in practice
are big, and therefore are designed and stored in fragments called
packages. Gathering them together (virtually via the so called package
merge)  is an operation based on taking colimits of the diagram
specifying package relationships. Code generation/change of base in
the presence of packages gives rise to sheaves. And so on.

Of course I did  not mean that Eclipse developers explicitly used
categorical ideas. Relations between software systems like Eclipse and
cat. theory are like relations between physical phenomena and their
mathematical models.

although a part of Eclipse but an important one. Here is what the EMF
Book [1] says (pages 4-5):
<<
The development work in Eclipse is divided into several top-level
projects, including the Eclipse Project, the Modeling Project, the
Tool Project, and the Technology project.
....
The Eclipse Modeling Project is the focal point for the evolution and
promotion of model-based development technologies at Eclipse. At its
core is EMF, which provides the basic framework for modeling. Other
modeling sub-projects build on top of the EMF core, providing such
capabilities as model transformation, database integration, and
graphical editor generation...

The starting date for the postdoctoral position is September 2009
although later dates may be also considered.

Description
The general purpose of the project CHOCO is to investigate
the syntactic, semantic and algebraic aspects of proof theory
in order to integrate concurrency theory in the Curry-Howard
correspondence between proofs and programs.

The interdisciplinary nature of the project between proof theory
and concurrency theory means that candidates from various
scientific horizons are welcome to apply. On the other hand,
we will consider with special interest applications by candidates
with background in one or several of the fields:
- linear logic (proof nets, geometry of interaction)
- semantics (game semantics, vectorial semantics)
- concurrency theory (process calculi, presheaf semantics)
- type theory (realizability, types for process calculi)
- rewriting theory (lambda-calculus, diagrammatic rewriting)
- category theory (categorical algebra, topos theory)
The applicant should hold a PhD or be about to defend
his/her PhD thesis by December 2009.

The postdoc researcher will work within the laboratory PPS
(Preuves, Programmes, Systemes)
      http://www.pps.jussieu.fr
which is internationally recognized as one of the leading
research laboratories in mathematics and computer science,
with its distinctive proof-theoretic culture.

The laboratory PPS is located in Chevaleret, the largest research
community of mathematicians in France. The laboratory PPS
is also part of the Fondation Sciences Mathematiques de Paris.
http://www.sciencesmath-paris.fr

Strong interaction of the postdoc researcher with the partner sites
of the CHOCO project is also expected:
- Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris Nord.
- Laboratoire d'Informatique du Parallelisme, Lyon,
- Laboratoire de Mathematiques de l'Universite de Savoie, Chambery
- Institut de Mathematiques de Luminy, Marseille,
- Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Marseille,
Further information will possibly be made available
from the web page of the project indicated above.
