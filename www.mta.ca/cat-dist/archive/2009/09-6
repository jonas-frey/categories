Final Coalgebras in Accessible Categories,
by Panagis Karazeris, Apostolos Matzaris and Jiri Velebil

Abstract:
We give conditions on a finitary endofunctor of a finitely accessible
category to admit a final coalgebra. Our conditions always apply to the
case of a finitary endofunctor of a locally finitely presentable (l.f.p.)
category and they bring an explicit construction of the final coalgebra i=
n
this case. On the other hand, there are interesting examples of final
coalgebras beyond the realm of l.f.p. categories to which our results
apply. We rely on ideas developed by Tom Leinster for the study of
self-similar objects in topology.=20

Best regards,
Panagis Karazeris

Dusko,

let me just notice that we are maintaining a *free software* tool
that actually is built upon categorical ideas (using Goguen's
and Burstall's institutions) and that computes colimits
(there is a menu Edit -> Proofs -> Compute Colimit

http://www.dfki.de/sks/hets

It is published under a free license, so you can freely download
the binaries, the source, modify the source, and republish your

Consider the theory of a monad, i.e., the axioms are those of a
category and a monad given as a triple: an operation T on objects, for
each object A a morphism eta_A : A -> T A, and an operation lift_{A,B}
which maps morphisms f : A -> T B to lift f : T A -> T B. Concretely,
the axioms are (where lift f is written f* and composition is
juxtaposition):

id f = f
f id = f
(f g) h = f (g h)
eta* = id
f* eta = f
(f* g)* = f* g*

Presumably, the equational theory (with partial operations) of such a
triple is decidable. Is this known? If we ignore the types and
partiality, we can attempt to turn the above equations into a
confluent terminating rewrite system using the Knuth-Bendix algorithm,
but it gets stuck (on various orderings I tried).

A more categorical way of asking the same question is: what is a
concrete description of the free "monad on a category" (is this the
same as  "free monad" on "free category"?).

With kind regards,

Andrej

I thank eveyone who answered my question so quickly. For reference I
post a summary of the answers.

Bill Lawvere answered that "the theory of a monad is just that of
ordinal addition of 1 on the augmented simplicial category Delta
considered as a (non-commutative) monoidal category wrt ordinal
addition." A relevant reference in this regard is his "Ordinal Sums
and Equational Doctrines" which was part of the Zurich Triples Book,
available online as TAC Reprints 18.

Similarly, Jaap van Oosten pointed out that the free "monad on a
category" on one generator is the simplicial category \Delta (nonempty
finite ordinals and monotone functions).

It follows from these observations that the theory of a monad is decidable.

Todd Wilson kindly pointed me to a thesis by Wolfgang Gehrke, see
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.47.7087 ,
which contains a complete set of rewrite rules (page 40, Proposition
20) for the theory of a monad:

id f ==> f
f id ==> f
(f g) h ==> f (g h)
eta* ==> id
f* eta ==> f
f* g* ==> (f* g)*
f* (eta g) ==> f g
f* (g* h) ==> (f* g)* h

The last two rules are extra, compared to the original equations. So
the next time you wonder whether an equation holds of a general monad,
just use the above rewrite rules on both sides of the equation.

With kind regards,

Andrej

In reply to Hasse Riemann's question (see below):

I remember being asked this kind of question at a Topology conference in
Baku in 1987.  It is worth discussing the background to this, as someone who
has never gone for a `famous problem', but found myself trying to develop
some mathematics to express some basic intuitions.

Saul Ulam remarked to me in 1964 at my first international conference
(Syracuse, Sicily) that a young person may feel the most ambitious thing to
do is to tackle a famous problem; but this may distract that person from
developing the mathematics most appropriate to them. It was interesting that
this remark came from someone as good as Ulam!

G.-C. Rota writes in `Indiscrete thoughts' (1997):
What can you prove with exterior algebra that you cannot prove without it?"
Whenever you hear this question raised about some new piece of mathematics,
be assured that you are likely to be in the presence of something important.
In my time, I have heard it repeated for random variables, Laurent Schwartz'
theory of distributions, ideles and Grothendieck's schemes, to mention only
a few. A proper retort might be: "You are right. There is nothing in
yesterday's mathematics that could not also be proved without it. Exterior
algebra is not meant to prove old facts, it is meant to disclose a new
world. Disclosing new worlds is as worthwhile a mathematical enterprise as
proving old conjectures. "

It is like the old military question:  do you make a frontal attack; or find
a way of rendering the obstacle obsolete?

I was early seduced (see my first two papers) by the idea of looking for
questions satisfying 3 criteria:
1) no-one had previously asked it;
2) the question was technically easy to answer;
3) the answer was important.

Usually it has been 2) which failed!

Of course you do not find such questions where everyone is looking! It could
be interesting to investigate how such questions arise, perhaps by pushing a
point of view as far as it will go, or seeing a new analogy.

"If at first, the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it." Albert
Einstein
It could be interesting to investigate historically:

 if (let us suppose) category theory has advanced without a fund of famous
open problems, how then has it advanced?

One aim of mathematics is understanding, making difficult things easy,
seeing why something is true. Thus improved exposition is an important part
of the progress of mathematics (even if this is ignored by Research
Assessment Exercises). R. Bott said to me (1958) that Grothendieck was
prepared to work very hard to make something tautological. By contrast, a
famous algebraic topologist replied to a question of mine about his graduate
text by asking: `Is the function not continuous?' He never gave me a proof!
And I never found it! (Actually the function was not well defined, but that
I could fix!)
Grothendieck wrote to me in 1982: `The introduction of the cipher 0 or the
group concept was general nonsense too, and mathematics was more or less
stagnating for thousands of years because nobody was around to take such
childish steps ...'. See also

http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/Grothendieck-speculation.html

The point I am trying to make is that the question on `open problems' raises
issues on the nature of,  on professionalism in, and so on the methodology
of, mathematics. It is a good question to start with.

Hope that helps.

Ronnie Brown

Probably people are going to jump on me for saying this, but it seems to
me that category theory is different from much of mathematics in that
often the difficulty is in the definitions rather than the theorems, and
in the questions rather than the answers.  Thus, there are probably many
unsolved problems in category theory, but we don't know what they are
yet, because figuring out what they are is the main aspect of them
that is unsolved.  (-:

Dear Andrej,

The free monad on a category has a well-known simple concrete description.
Let Ordf be the category of finite ordinals and order-preserving maps.
        -->
0 --> 1 <-- 2 ...
        -->
(This is sometimes called the algebraicist's simplicial category - it
contains the topologist's simplicial category as the full subcategory of
non-empty finite ordinals. Ordf is simply called Delta in Categories for the
Working Mathematician.) Ordinal sum makes Ordf into a strict monoidal
category. The object 1 is a monoid in this monoidal category, and in fact
is the "free monoid in a monoidal category", in the sense that for any
strict monoidal category C, there is a bijection between monoids in C and
strict monoidal functors from Ordf to C. (There is also a non-strict version
of this fact.)

The free "category with a monad" on a category A is the Ordf x A, with monad
having endofunctor part (n,a) |-> (n+1,a), with the obvious multiplication.

More generally, the monoidal category Ordf can be regarded as a one-object
2-category mnd, and 2-functors mnd-->K for a 2-category K, are in bijection
with monads in K. Freely adding a monad to an object of K can be seen as
left Kan extension along the unique 2-functor 1-->mnd.

Regards,

Steve Lack.

Hi!

not touching the partiality issue the answer to the question about=20
decidability is positive. Decidability follows from the results, proved=20

Generic Effects", accepted for the upcoming CALCO conference. The paper=20
should be soon available on my homepage:=20
http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~sergey/papers_e.htm
It does contain a confluent and strongly normalising rewrite system but=20
the proof details will show up (hopefully) only in the journal version.=20
The proofs are also included into my PhD thesis, which is under=20
development and thus still unpublished but in case of interest I can=20
make available some parts of it containing the proofs under discussion.

Dear Andrej,

It seems to me that the monad-on-a-category freely generated by one
object should be the simplicial category Delta, following from the facts
that Delta contains the universal monoid and a monad on C is a monoid in
C^C - see Mac Lane Cats for Working Mathematician Section VII.5, VII.6.
The object n of Delta will correspond to T^n(X) where T is the (functor
for the) monad and X the generating object. If I've got that right then
I would presume it's already known and proved carefully somewhere.

After that, the monad-on-a-category freely generated by a category C
would seem to be CxDelta. (Object (X,n) represents T^n(X), morphism
(f,s): (X,m) -> (Y,n) corresponds to T^m(f);s(Y): T^m(X) -> T^m(Y) ->
T^n(Y) and using naturality of T to deduce that s(Y);T^n(g) =
T^m(g);s(Z) so the f's can always be shunted to the left.) Again, if
I've got that right then it wouldn't surprise me to find it's already known.

This would suggest that C |-> CxDelta is a monad on Cat. Then a monad on
C is a structure morphism CxDelta -> C, i.e. Delta -> C^C with
appropriate properties, which looks like a monoid in C^C, which we knew
already.

I don't know Knuth-Bendix well enough to understand the issues there.
But since you mention various orderings, that reminds me of Freyd's
trick in "essentially algebraic" presentations of these cartesian
theories. (Amongst theories of partial operators, it is the cartesian
theories that have good universal algebraic properties.) That involves
ordering the operators so that, for each one, its domain of definition
is defined by equations involving "earlier" operators. (Ultimately that
comes down to total operators, for which no equations are needed.) Then
the equations s = t are understood in the sense "if s and t are both
defined, then they are equal". I don't know if that can be accommodated
in Knuth-Bendix as it stands. In particular, I don't know how amenable
K-B is to incorporating conditional rewrites. Conditional equations seem
inevitable in cartesian theories; the essentially algebraic formulation
reduces them to definedness explicitly conditional on equations, and
equations implicitly conditional on definedness. You might want to look
at my paper with Palmgren, which unifies them by identifying definedness
with self-equality.

You ask whether a free "monad on a category" is the same as a "free
monad" on "free category". Of course, in using the word "free" one ought
to be careful what kind of structure these are free over, but generally
speaking if the forgetful functors compose then so will their left
adjoints, the free functors.

Best wishes,

Steve.

Finding the "right" questions and notions is certainly a prominent
theme in category theory, perhaps more prominently than in other
fields. Still, just like in other fields, solving open problems was
always part of the agenda. For example, half a century ago people asked
whether every "standard construction" (=monad) is induced by an
adjunction, and it took a few years to have two interesting answers.
And there is ceratinly a string of examples leading all the way to
today.

I don't know whether there are any >famous< unsolved problems in
ordinary category theory, but there are certainly non-trivial
questions. Here is one that we formulated in an article with Reinhard
B"orger (Can. J. Math 42 (1990) 213-229) two decades ago:

A category A is total (Street-Walters) if its Yoneda embedding A --->
Set^{A^{op}} has a left adjoint. Then
1. A has small colimits, and
2. any functor A-->B that preserves all existing colimits of A has a
right adjoint.
Do properties 1 and 2 imply totality for A?

I must admit that, after formulating the question we never considered
it again, so there may well be a known or quick answer. So don't hold
back please, especially since I plan to incorporate several questions
of this type in my CT09 talk.

Walter.

Hello categorists

=20

To those who have replied on my question and others.

=20

First i want to thank for the suggestions of problems.

=20

Since i am new here some people assume that i seek a problem to solve so =
i can quickly become famous.
I am in fact much more interested in the structure and foundation of math=
ematics than solving
math problems. I just felt i should know these problems since they are fa=
mous, but almost none came to mind.

=20

A reason for this is that the proofs i have seen have mostly been "not wa=
ter tight", they miss some things (mostly in the logic).
And, they are not spelled out in full but are very "cut down" in their ar=
guments. This makes them too time
consuming to follow. I don't want to read a proof to recreate half of it =
but to understand why something is true.

=20

"A mathematical theory is not to be considered complete until you have ma=
de it so clear that you can explain it to the first man whom you meet on =
the street" -David Hilbert

=20

I argue that the same is true for proofs. Something to think about next t=
ime you write a proof.

=20

In Dyson Freemans terminology i am a bird and not a frog. As a bird i mus=
t say that it is sad that about 90% of mathematicians are frogs. This giv=
e an inbalance in mathematics.

=20

To answer Michael Shulman:

Yes, there is something different about category theory. It is at the top=
 of mathematics. A perfect place for a bird :)

=20

Now to my question.

=20

After some intensive work and help from people on the mailing list i have=
 found
some problems that are interesting in ordinary category theory :)

=20

You just have to learn to see them. Some won't be stated even as problems=
 to solve.

=20

To illustrate my point:
How many categories of n objects are there up to categorical equivalence =
for n a natural number?
If it can not be given directly, can it be expressed by other counting fu=
nctions?
Maby the pattern is easier than that for groups.

=20

A simplified version of the problem is to count only finite categories wi=
th at most 1 morphism between any objects.
This suggests the NC(r,s)-problem:
What is the number of categories with r objects and at most s morphisms (=
in one direction) between any two objects.

=20

Specialized versions of these are to count model categories, toposes (def=
ined as categories and not as 2-categories),...
Correct me if it is not so, but i don't know of any theorem that model ca=
tegories or toposes must be infinite.

=20

Another example first stated by John Baez that i call the no-go quantizat=
ion conjecture:
There is no functor from the symplectic category (symplectic manifolds an=
d symplectomorphisms) to the Hilbert category (Hilbert spaces and unitary=
 operators) that preserves positivity. I.e. a one-parameter group of symp=
lectic transformations generated by a positive Hamiltonian is mapped to a=
 one-parameter group of unitary operators with a positive generator.

=20

That maby helps to find the problems. Not that i am trying to popularize =
them.
If you know some you can still e-mail them to me.

=20

Now from the question to the mysterious Hasse Riemann!

=20

It seems that people wonder about me so here i go.

This is written from a 15 year old gymnasium account from the time of the=
 beginning of internet.
Bernhard Riemann was my hero then because of riemannian geometry and riem=
ann surfaces.
Actually i have still not managed to replace Riemann!
Hasse is just a name that i think fits me more than Rafael.
Since everyone i e-mail knows me by this pseudo i have decided not to cha=
nge it.

=20

It took me 20 years of studying mathematics to find category theory.
It is a long time but it was hardly wasted time.
I actually went into category theory 3 times before (not so deep), but no=
t until this fourth time
i understood what category theory really is and that it is precisely what=
 i was looking for :)
,and hence decided to stay here for a long while.


The first year in category theory went with a blazing speed.
Now, a half year after that i have more questions than facts.
I happen to be seated in Stockholm. It is not a bad place but there are n=
o category theorists in Sweden!
Hence i'm counting on you people.

=20

Best regards

Rafael Borowiecki

This is what stuck with me from the e-mail

Indeed they don't teach you this at the university=2C but somehow i always =
knew it.

It was obvious from the start=2C then i had to resist everyone trying to te=
ll me otherwise.

I am glad that there are other who see this as well.

=20

I like this quote since i like structuralizing mathematics.

Something to think about if you want to take the next step.

Fill in the void with a precise mathematical void.

One of my favorite quotes:

The question you raise ``how can such a formulation lead to
computations'' doesn't bother me in the least! Throughout my whole life
as a mathematician, the possibility of making explicit, elegant
computations has always come out by itself, as a byproduct of a thorough
conceptual understanding of what was going on. Thus I never bothered
about whether what would come out would be suitable for this or that,
but just tried to understand -- and it always turned out that
understanding was all that mattered.

A. Grothendieck


Raoul Bott reinforced this in a talk I had the privilige to hear back in
98.  He said that mathematics, done well, never required the placing of
your oar in the water (he probably put it better than that...).  The
idea I think is that if you continually ask and answer the questions
that occur to you, and, thus, gain understanding, then you will
inevitably make progress. And that is what matters, really.  So often
the person credited with solving a 'famous' problem only takes the final
step in a hard journey of a thousand miles made by a thousand others.

Glory and fame - such as it is in the world of mathematics - are nice,
but they are not, in the end,  mathematics.  I think it is of high
importance to avoid confusing them.

I think the reason for the silence is that category theory is a bit
different than other branches of mathematics.  Other branches of mathematics
get very excited about patterns that may exist, but may not.  So when
mathematicians hear the phrase "famous unsolved problems", that's the sort
of thing that comes to mind: for example, Goldbach's conjecture, the twin
prime conjecture, the Riemann hypothesis or the Hodge conjecture.

On the other hand, category theorists tend to get excited about taking
already partially understood patterns in mathematics and making them very
clear.   So, the most important open problems often aren't  of the form "Is
this statement true or false?"  Instead, they tend to be a bit more
open-ended, like "Develop a workable theory of n-categories."  So, they
don't have names.

I've tried to encourage people to work on n-categories by emphasizing five
"hypotheses": the homotopy hypothesis, the stabilization hypothesis, the
cobordism hypothesis, the tangle hypothesis, and the generalized tangle
hypothesis.  I didn't want to call them "conjectures", because they're a bit
open-ended.  But they're precise enough that someone can claim to have
proved one, and people can probably agree on whether this has occurred.  For
example, Jacob Lurie claims to have proved the cobordism hypothesis:

http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0465

http://lab54.ma.utexas.edu:8080/video/lurie.html

and when he provides the full details, people should be able to decide if he
has.

Best,
jb

Rafael Borowiecki, under the alias Hasse Riemann, asked,
> Are there any famous unsolved problems in category theory?

Ronnie Brown's posting in response to this is a classic, and
deserves to be printed out and pinned up in every graduate
student's office!   I particularly like the military analogy
with the choice between a frontal assault and making the
obstacle obsolete.   The following point is especially important:

> I was early seduced (see my first two papers) by the idea of
> looking for questions satisfying 3 criteria:
> 1) no-one had previously asked it;
> 2) the question was technically easy to answer;
> 3) the answer was important.
> **** Usually it has been 2) which failed! ****

I sent (a version of) the following reply to "categories" when
Rafael first asked the question, but then asked Bob to withdraw
it as I thought I could write it better.  I put off doing so
because other topics were under discussion,  but by his posting
Ronnie has obliged me to send it, since otherwise I would just
be a chicken.

So here goes:

Do I hear taunts of "do you have a Fields Medal?"?

These are a bit like those of "do you have a girlfriend?".

Well, no, I admit it. I don't.   I have a boyfriend (Richard), and
some of you have met him.   If you bear with me, you will see that
this is not a completely frivolous answer, even though it is a
personal one.

My point is that there are analogies between being a gay man and
being a conceptual--constructive mathematician:

- They both involve long periods of self-doubt and pretence in the
   face of real and perceived discrimation.  This is very much still
   real in the mathematical case, as evidenced by that fact that
   categorists and consructivists are largely to be found in
   computer science departments, excluded from mathematics in case
   they might corrupt the youth.

- The result of this is a significantly delayed adolescence --
   I have met gay men going through adolescence in the 50s or 70s.

- Finally, there is pride in being who you are, and the recognition
   of "Honi soit qui mal y pense" -- that it is the people who think
   ill of it that have the problem.  In the words of a song from
   "La Cage aux Folles" that is known as the "sweet potato song",
   "I yam what I yam!".

Before I came out as a categorist, I pretended to be interested
in difficult puzzles,   I was in the British team in the
International Mathematical Olympiad in 1979, but didn't do very
well.  I started a magazine called QARCH, whose total output
in 30 years amounts to less than one of my papers now.

I was taught as an undergraduate by the Hungarian analyst and
graph theorist Bela Bollobas.  He set problems for first year
students problems that took three weeks to solve, if at all.
(Bela is a mathematician of considerable stature -- so great that
it took me five years to notice that he is 10cm shorter than me --
and I remember him with great affection, in case he gets to read this.)

However, I hope that Bela (along with Andrej Bauer, Imre Leader and
Dorette Pronk, who help organise IMO things in Slovenia, Britain and
Canada nowadays), will forgive me if I say that there is something
fundamentally unsatisfying about IMO problems.   Once you have the
solution, that is it.  They are like crosswords or jigsaws or sudoku.

After that I had my delayed adolescence (with an unsuitable
boyfriend).  I studied continuous posets instead of algebraic
ones and categories instead of posets, just to show that I could.
Somebody should have told me to get a proper job as a programmer,
but they didn't have the guts to say it to me.  (If graduate
students ask me for advice nowadays, I do tell them to get proper
jobs, and not surprisingly they (mis)interpret this personally.)

Long after this, the first paper on Abstract Stone Duality was
published on my 40th birthday, more or less.   According to
G H Hardy's depressing "Mathematician's Apology", and to the rules
for getting a Fields Medal,  I was officially finished as a
mathematician.  But it is pretty clear that I have been doing
my best mathematics during my fifth decade.  On the other hand,
all of those gratuitously difficult problems had gone into the mix.

Before I return to the question.  please refer to number 6 in
     en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_problems
which asks for the axiomatisation of physics.  Even in this most
famous collection of gratuitously difficult problems, we find a
conceptual question.

The first of Hilbert's problems is called the "continuum hypothesis",
but is about smashing the continuum into dust.   Elsewhere, he
said "no-one shall expell us from Cantor's Paradise", but I regard
it as a dystopia.  I dream of some eventual escape, returning to the
Euclidean paradise.  There we would actually talk about lines,
circles, compact subsets or whatever, instead of families of subsets
or arcane algebra (or, indeed, category theory).   I am looking for
a language for mathematics that would look like "set theory" (as
mathematicians, not set theorists, perceive it) but would yields
computable continua instead of dust.

More categorically, I believe that there is some notion of category
that is very similar to an elementary topos, but in which all
morphisms are continuous (in particular Scott continuous with
respect to an intrinsic order).

I also believe that these ideas are applicable to other subjects.
When I have made the appropriate tools, I hope to be able to understand
algebraic geometry, which was a complete mystery to me as a student.
I am in princple capable of doing this, BECAUSE I am a categorist,
by following the analogy between frames and rings.

One version of this problem that I still cannot solve is a question
that Eugenio Moggi asked me in April 1993, although I forget the
exact words.   We wanted a class of monos (I said they should be
the equalisers targetted at power of Sigma) that was closed under
composition and application of the Sigma^2 functor (ie taking the
exponential Sigma^(-) twice).

Another is how to embed the category of locales in a CCC WITHOUT
using illegitimate presheaves (Vickers and Townsend) or the axiom
of collection (Heckmann).  When I wrote the original version of
this posting a couple of weeks back, I thought I could solve this
one.  I am still hopeful, but it turns out to be a powerful question,
cf Ronnie's (2) above.

Notice that I give the principal formulation of the question in
vague language, not as a Diophantine equation.  The more specific
the question, the more likely it is to have been the WRONG one.
Asking an impertinent question is the best way of getting a
pertinent answer.

This still involves very difficult problems and hundreds of journal
pages of formal proofs.  But for me the problems serve the concepts
rather than the other way round.  This is the essence of what it is
to be a conceptual mathematician.   Ronnie Brown has told you a
different story of his own, but with the same message.  Many
other experienced categorists (including the ones in higher
dimensions, which Rafael excluded from his original question,
for some reason) would do likewise.

What about Fields Medals?   People will get them, using my work,
two or three generations down the line.

Hi,

Sam Lindley and Ian Stark proved that Moggi's computational
Metalanguage (\lambda_ML) is decidable - this is simply typed lambda
calculus with a monad. If I am not mistaken your theory can be
faithfully encoded in \lambda_ML.

Actually, isn't it the case that the continuation monad is actually
the free monad. Hence, using this result decidability of \lambda_ML
should follow from the decidability of simply typed lambda calculus.

Cheers,
Thorsten

John,

Glad you liked it! Thanks for the references to Raoul Bott.

Mind you there was a serious point:

how to turn abstract mathematics into machine computation?

I have discussed this often with Larry Lambe.

Dear Rafael,

here is a list of problems from categorical logic that I find difficult
to solve and don't know the answer yet. Certainly they are more on the logical
side but categories are involved in all of them. I don't claim that these
problems are generally important for category theory but they simply do bother
me. I write this mail to show that there are technically hard problems and
with the salient hope that someone may come up with an answer. Nevertheless
I am aware that the subsequent list of problems might easly get a prize for
the "best collection of most misleading problems".

(1) In their booklet "Algebraic Set Theory" Joyal and Moerdijk defined
    for every strongly inaccessible cardinal \kappa a class of
    \kappa-small maps inside the effective topos.

    Does there exist a "generic" \kappa-small map such that all other maps
    can be obtained as pullbacks from this generic one?

    In their book the authors show the existence of a weakly generic one
    but this doesn't imply the existence of a generic one and I suspect
    there is none.

(2) Does there exist a model for Martin-L\"of's Intensional Type Theory
    which validates Church's Thesis?

    This question is due to M.Maietti and G.Sambin. Notice that type theory
    validates the axiom of choice and, accordingly, the statement is much
    stronger than saying that for every function from N to N there exists a
    code for an algorithm computing this function.

(3) In my habilitation thesis
    (www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/HabilStreicher.pdf)
    I showed that the sconing of the effective topos (i.e. glueing
    Gamma : Eff -> Set) gives rise to a model of INTENSIONAL Martin-Loef
    type theory faithfully reflecting most of the weakness compared to
    EXTENSIONAL type theory.
    Martin Hofmann and I showed that the groupoid model refutes
    the principle UIP saying that all elements of identity types are equal.
    This has recently generalised to \omega-groupoids by M.Warren and there
    is recently some activity of constructing models based on abstract
    homotopy.

    Can one construct a categorical model model serving both purposes?

    This is an issue since the groupoid model and related ones constructed
    more recently have the defect that all types over N are fairly extensional
    and thus don't do the job which sconing of the effective topos does.

(4) Is the realizability model for the polymorphic lambda calculus
    parametric in the sense of Reynolds?
    It needn't be realizability over natural numbers.
    Would be interesting already for some pca!

Thomas

Dear category theory community,

There are Fundamental Theorems of Arithmetic, Algebra, Calculus, and
indeed, many more.

My question is, What would be candidates for the Fundamental Theorem
of Category Theory?

Yoneda Lemma comes to my mind. What do you think?

Best,

I don't follow to the end here.
Why should presheaves be illegitimate?
Then=2C i suppose the axiom of collection is valid at least in the CCC.
But what is so bad about the axiom of collection in this case?

Do the embedding get bad?

Dear All -

Here a question related to categorical logic (or categorical proof theory=
)
of a very different type. I would like to put it here because it is an
illustration of another part of the field and also because it is
technically difficult and interesting.

It is well known that certain systems of propositional logic have a
natural structure of free category for certain classes of categories with
structure. For example, we have a structure of free Symmetric Monoidal
Closed Category on the Intuitionistic Multiplicative Linear Logic. In thi=
s
structure formulas are objects and equivalence classes of derivations of
the sequents A -> B are morphisms.

Free SMCC (in presence of "tensor unit" I) is not "fully coherent": there
are non-commutative diagrams. For example, one has the Mac Lane's example
A*** -> B***
(called "triple dual diagram"). In terms of IMLL there exist two
non-equivalent derivations of
((A-oI)-oI)-o I -> ((A-oI)-oI)-o I
w.r.t. the equivalence of free SMCC on the derivations of IMLL.  One
derivation is identity, another derivation is obtained in obvious way
using the derivability of ((A-oI)-oI)-o I -> A-o I.  Let us denote these
derivations 1 and f respectively. (For the sequent ((A-oI)-oI)-o I ->
((A-oI)-oI)-o I every derivation is equivalent to 1 or to f.)

The "triple dual conjecture" says that if we declare f\equiv 1 then all
the derivations with the same final sequent in IMLL will become
equivalent. I.e. the stronger categorical structure than SMCC (obtained b=
y
adding this new axiom for equivalence/ commutativity of diagrams) will be
"fully coherent".

If it is true we would have an interesting new variety of categories
(subvariety of SMCCs) in the sense of Universal Algebra.

Proof-theoretically, the study of this conjecture requires to study the
equivalence relations on derivations of IMLL between the relation of free
SMCC and the relation  that  identifies all derivations with the same
final sequent.

In my paper
S. Soloviev. On the conditions of full coherence in closed categories.
Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, 69:301-329, 1990.

it was shown that
 - if the "triple dual diagram" is commutative w.r.t. some equivalence
relation ~ (containing the relation of free SMCC)
- and the following additional condition holds:
[a-oI/a] h ~ [a-oI/a] g =3D> h~g
for any two derivations of the same sequent,

then all the derivations of the same sequent in IMLL become equivalent.

The additional condition is a) difficult to verify b)  has the form
different form the equational form ("commutativity of a diagram") require=
d
from the point of view of Universal Algebra approach. All the attempts to
prove "pure" triple dual conjecture (by myself and others) did not yet
succeed.

One may mention that it is known that some intermediate equivalence
relations between the relation of free SMCC and the "total" relation of
derivations do exist:
L. Mehats, S. Soloviev. Coherence in SMCCs and equivalences on deriva-
tions in IMLL with unit. Annals of Pure and Applied Logic, v.147, 3, p.
127-179, august 2007.

but all known intermediate relations are contained in the relation
generated by commutativity of triple dual diagram.

My ph.d. student
Antoine El Khoury has checked also that the commutativity of triple
dual diagram (equivalence of 1 and f) implies equivalence of derivations
of the balanced sequents with 1, 2 or 3 variables (commutativity
of corresponding diagrams in SMCC).

Remark. Obviosly, the commutativity of triple dual diagram implies
A*** isomorphe to A*.

Best regards to all

Sergei Soloviev

I have a question for the categories list: it is well-known (and proven
e.g. in Hollander's PhD thesis) that categories fibered in groupoids over
a small category C are equivalent to lax presheaves of groupoids on C. I
would like to use the generalization of this result in which the word
"groupoids" is replaced throughout by "small categories." It is not hard
to write out how this proof goes, but I suspect there is some vast
generalization of this, e.g. with the word "groupoids" replaced by
"quasicategories" or something of that nature, which somebody has already
proven, and in that case I would prefer to cite the more general result.
Does anyone know if something like this is already in the literature?

Thanks,
Andrew S.

My suggestion would be the theorem that left adjoints preserve colimits,
and right adjoints preserve limits.

This may not be the deepest theorem in category theory, but

(a) it's pretty darn deep,
(b) it describes a beautiful connection between two fundamental notions
in the subject,
(c) it admits a huge variety of applications in "ordinary" mathematics.

I've occasionally referred to this theorem as the Fundamental Theorem of
Category Theory by way of emphasizing its importance while teaching, but
I've always immediately clarified that it's only me who uses this term :-)

Walter Tholen's recent message reminded me of a conjecture. Perhaps
we have been too shy about stating our conjectures because, even
among mathematicians, they may have seemed too technical.

I seem to remember Peter Freyd saying once that the problem in
category theory of proving sets were small (to find adjoints to
functors for example) was analogous to finding numerical bounds in
mathematical analysis. Surely by now, there are as many people who
understand what a sheaf is as understand what the Riemann Hypothesis
asserts (for example, local to global versus analytic continuation).

So here is a problem I came up with in the 1970s. As with Fermat's
Last Theorem, I don't particularly remember having any application
for it. However, similar solved problems were used by Rosebrugh-Wood
to characterize the category of sets in terms of adjoint strings
involving the Yoneda embedding. By locally small I mean having homs
in a chosen category Set of small sets.

Problem. Suppose A is a locally small site whose category E of Set-
valued sheaves is also locally small. Is E a topos?

Perhaps that, yes; or, perhaps, the characterization of representable
functors.

Terminal sequences for accessible endofunctors=20
James Worrell

Abstract:

We consider the behaviour of the terminal sequence of an accessible
endofunctor T on a locally presentable category K. The preservation of
monics by T is sufficient to imply convergence, necessarily to a
terminal coalgebra. We can say much more if K is Set, and =CE=BA is =CF=89=
. In
that case it is well known that we do not necessarily get convergence at
=CF=89, however we show that to ensure convergence we don't need to go to=
 a
higher cardinal, just to the next limit ordinal, =CF=89 + =CF=89.

For an =CF=89-accessible endofunctor T on Set the construction of the
terminal coalgebra can thus be seen as a two stage construction, with
each stage being finitary. The first stage obtains the Cauchy completion
of the initial T-algebra as the =CF=89-th object in the terminal sequence=
 A=CF=89.
In the second stage this object is pruned to get the final coalgebra A=CF=
=89
+=CF=89. We give an example where A=CF=89 is the solution of the correspo=
nding
domain equation in the category of complete ultra-metric spaces.

[From moderator: Resent with apologies to those who received an empty
message body...]

Walter Tholen's recent message reminded me of a conjecture. Perhaps
we have been too shy about stating our conjectures because, even
among mathematicians, they may have seemed too technical.

I seem to remember Peter Freyd saying once that the problem in
category theory of proving sets were small (to find adjoints to
functors for example) was analogous to finding numerical bounds in
mathematical analysis. Surely by now, there are as many people who
understand what a sheaf is as understand what the Riemann Hypothesis
asserts (for example, local to global versus analytic continuation).

So here is a problem I came up with in the 1970s. As with Fermat's
Last Theorem, I don't particularly remember having any application
for it. However, similar solved problems were used by Rosebrugh-Wood
to characterize the category of sets in terms of adjoint strings
involving the Yoneda embedding. By locally small I mean having homs
in a chosen category Set of small sets.

Problem. Suppose A is a locally small site whose category E of Set-
valued sheaves is also locally small. Is E a topos?

Hi categorists
=20
OK, here is the beuty of collecting and spreading problems that many seem=
 to miss.
It just took me a few days to change my mood from the depressing answers
not to look for problems. Again i am much more for structuring of mathema=
tics.
=20
Usually you only get to know what is proved and not what is unproved.
Problems complete this by letting you know what to not to look for.
They also answer your questions even if it is by saying unkown or a conje=
cture.
Then, on the other hand, they are good research projects so they should b=
e widely known.
Just maby someone undertakest them and happens to find the solution.
But often he must first see the problem.
=20
The problems Ross Street put forward are so beautiful i have decided to p=
ost 2 problems
i have learned from him, unedited.
=20
1)
Fermat's Last Theorem is about the category of finite sets. Is there a ca=
tegorical proof?
Can we characterize those categories C in which x^n + y^n isomorphic to z=
^n has only trivial
solutions for n> 2?
=20
2)
The category of finite sets is a concrete form of the set N of natural nu=
mbers.
What are concrete forms of Z, Q, R and C?

If anyone know some problems of these sort below let me know.
=20
* characterization problems
* inherit properties problems
* every category/functor/... of type A is a category/functor/... of type =
B
=20
=20
I also foregot to mention before that i know and more than like Grothendi=
ecks philosophy
of dissolving problems by developing a proper framework for rhem.
=20

Yes, see section 3.3.2 of Jacob Lurie's "Higher Topos Theory" for the
statement for "quasicategory valued presheaves".

Limits, colimits, and adjoints:

I go along with this: it is the result of general category theory that I
have used most in studying colimits of forms of multiple groupoids, for
homotopical applications. It really does come under `categories for the
working mathematician'.

I have also been attracted in the same vein by fibrations and cofibrations
of categories: see a recent paper in TAC.

I well remember a remark of Henry Whitehead in response to a visiting
lecturer saying: `The proof is trivial.' JHCW: `It is the snobbishness of
the young to suppose that a theorem  is trivial because the proof is
trivial.'  (There  was and is no answer to that!) (His example was
Schroder-Bernstein.)

The leads to the interesting question of what makes a theorem nontrivial?
Good discussion topic for the young (at heart).

You could make your choice more comprehensive: Freyd's General and
Special Adjoint Functor Theorems give a more complete picture of the
fundamental relationship between limit preservation and adjointness.

Indeed. I think there's an analogy to be made between these theorems and
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: one side is very simply stated, and
the other requires more care. Compare

* d/dx (integral f(x) dx) = f(x),
* integral (d/dx f(x)) dx = f(x) [up to constant offset...]

with

* all right adjoints preserve limits,
* all limit-preserving functors [satisfying some caveats...] are right adjoints.

This is one of (probably) many problems of Girau topoi [satisfy all conditions
in Girau's Theorem exept (may be) the set of generators] which are not known
to be a topos.

Another, the Etale "topos" in the sense of Joyal's axiomatic theory of etal
maps (which is even a subcategory of a topos).

Another (solved), to show the existence of colimits in the category of topoi,
the only hard part is to get the generators.

Concerning the other thread (not Ross question)

Of course, Yoneda Lemma, at the birth of category theory, is the fundamental
result that makes of category theory something more than a convenient language.

Related to this, the definition of category should include small hom sets, and
categories with large hom sets should be called "illegitimate" (in the manner
of the definition of topoi, which include generators, the others being
illegitimate or "faux" in Grothendieck's terminology).

(*) It seems Not: Take a Girau (really faux but locally small) topos E, with
the canonical topology. Then the topos of sheaves should be E again, which is
not a topos (am I missing something ?).

I had wanted to give more careful consideration to this question
before posting about it again,  but an emergency has arisen:

My website (paultaylor.eu) is likely to be out of action for the rest
of this week. Apparently the hosting company was badly hacked, and
even their own webpage doesn't exist at the moment.  However, email
gets through to me by a backup route, so please do not try to second
guess my email address.   You can access my papers etc by adding
    site:paultaylor.eu
to a Google query and using their cached versions.

The version of my diagrams package on CTAN was out of date (sorry).
I have uploaded a new release (V3,93) and asked them to install it
quickly.  The package now automatically recognises when it is running
under XeTeX, as it has done with PDFTeX for some time.  I would like
to thank Apostolos Syropoulos for his help in implementing this, which
he wanted to use to combine my diagrams with Greek text in Unicode.

---

I would like to thank all of the people who sent supportive responses
to my autobiographical comments.   However, it seems that people read
these rather more literally than was intended,  whilst incorrectly
interpreting the "inappropriate boyfriend" as a metaphor.  I was
certainly not suggesting that I had a relevation about constructive
categorical logic during puberty (which would have coincided with
the invention of elementary toposes) and that this was suppressed
by my mathematical teachers until my rebellion!

Of course, this was exactly my point:  conceptual and constructive
thinking (which are by no means coincident) require mathematical
and personal maturity.

My reaction to Ellis Cooper's question about "Fundamental Theorems"
was that Ronnie Brown and others had answered this question under
the "famous unsolved problems" heading.   Notwithstanding the
occurrence of the phrases "fundamental theorem of algebra" and
"fundamental theorem of interval analysis" on my (dormant) website,

I would say that they demonstrate a fundamental lack of appreciation
of the breadth of mathematics, and are only appropriate for
schoolteachers to shoehorn the subject into a restrictive curriculum.
The adjoint functor theorem and the Yoneda Lemma are the two obvious
candidates for the title "fundamental theorem of category theory",
but I have to say that I am somewhat alarmed by prospect that the
apparent consensus about this might become "legislated" into
someone's lecture notes, curriculum or textbook.

I think that Ronnie Brown and other people have given the right answer
to the question about famous unsolved problems.  Category theory is
not a collection of miscellaneous problems like combinatorics,
but a way of thinking about mathematics.

Rafael Borowiecki, alias Hasse Riemann, did not seem to be satisfied
with these answers, so what I said to him privately is this:

It would help people to give better answers if he, along with
students and non-academics who ask questions on "categories",
gave some clearer indication of their mathematical background.

If you read the archives of "categories", you will find that people
discuss topics from many areas in mathematics, physics and computer
science.   You may find amongst this something that interests you,
in which case you should look up the web pages and papers of the people
who post on that topic.  Academics are not very responsive to
completely uninformed questions, but they usually are very happy
to help if you show some background.  It is also a good idea to
flatter them by indicating that you have looked at their papers.

Finally, Rafael queried some of the technical points about "illegitimate
presheaves on locales" that I made at the end of my "autobiography".
I will publish my private reply another time, as I have some other
things to say about locale theory.

Sorry for the hurried response.

Paul Taylor

Dear categorists,

When I read the question for the first time, I did not know such a =
problem.
Moreover, my impression was that in category theory one often finds new
results, which had not been conjectured before. Sometimes an important =
part
of the work is even to develop the right notions. This may explain that
there are less important well-known problems in category theory than in
other areas.

Nevertheless, I remember a problem that can be easily formulated in pure
category and is still unsolved as far as I know. Bur it does not seem =
vastly
distributed. Cantor's diagonal says that says that the power set always =
is
of larger cardinality as the original set. Gavin Wraith suggested the
following generalization to topoi: If for two objects A,B there is a
monomorphism A^B>->B, is there also a monomorphism A>->1? This looks =
like a
meaningful analogue, and I have not seen an answer in the meantime. The
question can even be asked not only in a topos, but in every cartesian
closed category. Does anybody know anything about progress?

Greetings
Reinhard

I presume that Ross was using the word "topos" to mean "elementary topos".
But in any case, Eduardo was missing something: the proof that, if E is
an \infty-pretopos (my preferred name for what he calls a "Girau(d)
topos"), then every canonical sheaf on E is representable, requires the
existence of a generating set (see C2.2.7 in the Elephant). For a
counterexample in the absence of generators, let G be the "large" group
of all functions from the ordinals to {0,1} having finite support, the
group operation being pointwise addition mod 2 (or, if you prefer,
the group of finite subsets of the ordinals under symmetric difference),
and let E be the (elementary) topos of G-sets. For each ordinal \alpha,
let A_\alpha be the set {0,1} with G acting via its \alpha-th factor;
then any G-set admits morphisms into only a set of the A_\alpha, from
which it follows that the coproduct of all the A_\alpha exists as a
(set-valued) canonical sheaf on E, though it clearly isn't a set.
Moreover, this coproduct admits a proper class of maps to itself, so
the category of sheaves on E isn't locally small; hence it doesn't
violate Ross's conjecture.

Dear Hasse,

The presheaves that Townsend and I used are on the category Loc of
locales. The fact that Loc is large may be seen as a problem, but
another illegitimacy is the way a presheaf is a functor to Sets. This
means, for instance, that for a representable presheaf y(X), where X is
a locale, we take y(X)(W) = Loc(W,X) to be a _set_ for any pair of
locales X and W, and that is foundationally tendentious. Whatever kind
of collection Loc(W,X) is (if W is locally compact then we can take it
to be another locale, but otherwise not), the ability to extract a "set
of points" from it is sensitive to the foundations.

We tried to be foundationally conservative in what we did with the
presheaves, and you can see come remarks on this in the conclusions of
our paper. (I should stress that we did not claim to have embedded Loc
in a CCC, and we tried not to make use of any particular categorical
properties of Presh(Loc).) Insofar as the representable presheaves y(X)
can be acceptable, then so too are their exponentials y(Y)^y(X), since
y(Y)^y(X)(W) = Loc(WxX,Y). What we showed is that then the exponential
y($)^(y($)^y(X)) also exists (where $ = the Sierpinski locale), and in
fact is representable of the form y(PP(X)) where PP(X) is the "double
powerlocale" on X. Thus PP(X) has a claim to be thought of as $^($^X)
even when X is not exponentiable (locally compact). PP is a
foundationally robust construction, available in both topos-valid locale
theory and predicative formal topology.

Regards,

Steve Vickers.

Steve Vickers has bounced me into replying to the questions about
locales that Rafael Borowiecki (aka Hasse Riemann) asked, even
though I had said that I would do so when I was ready with some
other comments on that subject.   The following also includes the
answer to a question that I myself raised last year, which has
further consequences for the appropriateness of locale theory
as an account of general topology, but I am not going to say what
these are until I am actually ready.

In my "autobiography", I had said,

> Another [problem] is how to embed the category of locales in a CCC
> WITHOUT using illegitimate presheaves (Vickers and Townsend) or
> the axiom of collection (Heckmann).  When I wrote the original version
> of this posting a couple of weeks back, I thought I could solve this

> cf Ronnie's (2) above.

Rafael asked me,
> Why should presheaves be illegitimate?

I am not saying that presheaves in general are illegitimate in the
plain English sense of the word.   The work that I was referring
to uses the category of all functors from the opposite of the
category of locales to the category of sets.   Since the category
of locales is "large", this functor-category is super-large or
"illegitimate", where the quoted words have a technical meaning.

As Steve Vickers has already explained, he goes to some trouble
to avoid the problems, essentially by exploring only a tiny part
of the presheaf category.  He really only uses the exponentials
Sigma^X of locales, which are the functors  Loc(-xX,Sigma).

The rest of the comments concern the paper
   @article{HeckmannR:carcec,
   title={A Cartesian Closed Extension of the Category of Locales},
   author={Heckmann, Reinhold},
   journal={Mathematical Structures in Computer Science},
   year={2006}, volume={16},  pages={231--253}}
which was inspired by Dana Scott's equilogical space construction.

However, Reinhold's "equivalence relations" are what the presheaf
category provides.  So a relation on a single locale requires data
from every object in the category.  (The details are rather
complicated, and I don't recall them exactly at the moment.)
The collection of morphisms between two equilocales is defined
as the image of a class in a set.

> Then, i suppose the axiom of collection is valid at least in the CCC.

No.  The axiom of collection says roughly that, given a function
from a class to a set, its image is a set.   This is quite a
strong axiom of set theory, and is certainly not valid in something
as logically weak as a CCC.

> But what is so bad about the axiom of collection in this case?

The vast majority of ordinary mathematics can be done in an elementary
topos with a natural number object, maybe together with assumptions
of excluded middle or the axiom of choice.   This is roughly but
not quite equivalent to Zermelo's set theory -- NOT ZFC, which adds
the substantially more powerful axiom-scheme of replacement.

Rather than using sledgehammers (adding more and more powerful axioms),
most categorists would prefer to re-examine the problem to look
for more delicate ways of doing things.

On a different aspect of locale theory, I asked on 22 July 2008,

> Where can I find a published proof that
>     if    X --->> Y   is a (not necessarily regular)  epi  of locales
>     then so is   X x Z --->> Y x Z   for any locale Z?
> NB  (I know that) this is not true for general pullbacks of locales!

Peter Johnstone told me, essentially, that I was assuming excluded
middle, in the form that every locale is open (as he would say) or
overt (using my word).  In fact, the answer is negative even with
excluded middle, as Till Plewe pointed out to me.   (Till no longer
studies categories or locales, but is still doing academic research
in Japan, or at least was last year when I was in touch with him.)

The (basis of the) counterexample that Till pointed out is described
in Peter's book (Stone Spaces) in section II 2.14.   It is the
locale QE of rationals with the Euclidean topology, that is, the
frame of open subsets of the reals, quotiented by their effect on
the rationals, so for example  (3,pi)v(pi,4) = (3,4) in QE since
pi is irrational.   I also write QD for the rationals with the
discrete topology, so QD is homeomorphic to N.

The point is that QE has enough points, indeed  QD-->>QE is epi,
but QExQE doesn't.

This means that   QDxQE --> QExQE  is not epi.

Dear Ellis
=20

I also had this question when i started with category theory but
i was satisfied with the Yoneda lemma. Now thanks to your question
i know more theorems to answer this.

I don't think you can get a better answer than the replied suggestions.
=20
However there is also higher category theory.
The interesting point would now be to generalize:
=20
What are the coresponding theorems for strict/weak n-categories?
=20
I plan to at least ask for and suggest a higher dimensional Yoneda lemma.
=20
The other adjoints preserving limits theorem is also interesting to
generalize. But here as far as i know there is no concept of adjoint
for 3-categories and higher up. I am more uncertain as to limits=2C
but i have not seen limits in n-categories defined in the
graceful style of limits in 1-categories.

Hello,

      I'm sorry that this a bit off topic (but both algebras are
categories), but I don't know where to post in order to get an intelligent
answer. Is there any research to base data base queries on Heyting algebra,
i.e. intuistionistic logic?

Thanks,

Should it not be weak oo-groupoids?
I think you also mean homotopy category of spaces instead of
"homotopy theory of spaces andthe related".
Spaces is a bit vague but i encounter this sometimes in category theory.
Usually in such statements it is ment a topological space.

Is there a categorical definition of a space (not a topological space)?

Due to the requirements of the restaurant, we have to place a deadline
for letting us know you intend to attend the banquet 19 July, during
the Makkaifest 18 - 20 June 2009 in Montreal.

    http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Makkaifest09/index_e.php

If you plan to attend the banquet, please let us know *BEFORE*
Wednesday noon (GMT) (17 June 2009).  Requests after that time may be
impossible to meet.  If you register, there is a place on the online
form where you can indicate your intentions; otherwise email me
directly.  (If you have already done so, no worries!)

The banquet will be held at the Musee des Beaux Arts, and will cost
around $55 - 60 each (tax & tip included, wine extra), to be paid at
the restaurant. (They will provide receipts.)

If you have special dietary requirements, please let me know - the
restaurant is very accommodating about such requests, as long as they
know in advance.  This includes vegetarian meals, allergies, etc.
The main course will consist of a choice of beef or salmon.

Vasili,

Are you familiar with the use of monads as an approach to modeling storage
semantics and access? The most high profile of these efforts is LINQ.
XQuery's FLWOR expressions are also based around this. i've been
investigating a very rich generalization. You get a logic out of the
following data:

   - a distributive law, d, between
   - a monad, T, representing the algebra of your term language (think
   what's described by the DB schema)
   - a monad, S, representing some notion of collection (set, list, tree,
   graph...)

The distributive law, d : ST -> TS is showing how collections of terms ST
are representable as terms over collections, TS. Then SELECT-FROM-WHERE is
precisely a comprehension which as Wadler shows maps clearly onto monadic
semantics. The generalization allows you to consider collections that have
notions of state. As a toy example, if your notion of collection is a
quantale, then you get a (not very convincing) notion of update. This is
closely related to current experiments factoring transactional semantics
through a monadic presentation. In fact, i've recently been helping folks
looking at the JTA specification arrived at a comprehension-based
presentation. (Check out the Scala and Lift mailing lists for that thread.)

i've written up and coded examples of how this works for 3 different term
languages: the usual notion of tuples (resulting in what one would expect, a
relational calculus), a graph algebra (resulting in a query language for
graphs), and a process algebra. You can find a blog entry about it, with
pointers to working code
here<http://biosimilarity.blogspot.com/2009/01/3-applications-of-indexed-composition.html>
.

Another nice thing about this approach is that it factors nicely through
languages with reduction semantics such as lambda calculi or process
calculi. So, you can extend the query semantics to include symbolic
reduction. In some sense, you turn a model-checker into a query engine
allowing you to add Hennessy-Milner-style modal operators to the query
language.

Best wishes,

--greg

Dear Professor Boerger,

there are counterexamples to this in elementary topoi. In the effective
topos there are nontrivial objects X such that 2^X is isomorphic to 2
(for example, one can take the object R of real numbers for X; this
gives a mono 2^R>->R), and the inclusion N-->N^{P(N)} is an isomorphism
(giving a mono N^{P(N)}>->P(N) , where P(N) is the power object of N).
I believe the example of 2^R>->R also holds in sheaf toposes where
(internally) the object of functions R^R coincides with the object of
continuous functions (since R is always connected).

Best, Jaap van Oosten

Dear Vasili,

I'm not sure how much this will answer your questions, but there was
some research towards the end of the last century relating databases and
 powerdomains. In a sense, then, the associated logic of database
queries is that of the open sets of the domain, i.e. geometric logic,
and hence (at least in its finitary form) a fragment of intuitionistic
logic. The names I associate with this work are Carl Gunter and Peter
Buneman. I wrote a 1992 paper "Geometric Theories and Databases" that
was inspired by them, though its main content was a topos-theoretic
construction.

Regards,

Steve Vickers.

I came from Algebraic Specifications to Category Theory. When my =20
students (computer science, software engineering) ask me about the =20
benefit of categories I'm referring often to the "Categorical =20
Manifesto" of Jo Goguen.

If they insist more and ask "Be honest! What is the REAL reason that =20
some theoreticians like categories so much?" Then I'm trying to be =20
honest and say: Because categories are the winner of the competition =20
"What mathematical structure is closed under the maximal number of =20
"reasonable" constructions". They have just the right amount of =20
structure - not too few, as graphs for example, and not to much, as =20
cpo's for example. And if there is time I'm telling them about the =20
"Erlanger Programm" of Felix Klein.

Of course we can turn this statement and say: If a construction =20
doesn't provide a category when the "inputs" are categories, then this =20
construction can not be considered to be a "reasonable construction".

Best regards

Uwe Wolter

production systems, and in theoretical work that promises to bring
practical, tangible benefit.

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to, the
following.

    Formal model-based development and code generation
    Abstraction and refinement
    Specification, verification and validation
    Formal testing approaches
    Integrated methods and theories for different programming paradigms
    Formal methods for object and component systems
    Tool development and integration
    Experiments involving verified systems
    Applications of formal methods

There will be a special track on UML (but in the scope of the ICFEM
remit as described above). ICFEM'09 will have a five-day technical
programme, including two days for tutorials and workshops, and three
days for a conference.

INVITED SPEAKERS

    Manfred Broy, Germany - FME Invited Lecture

Apropos of the Yoneda Lemma, is there some reason why it is usually
stated on its own rather than as one direction of a characterization of
categories of presheaves on J?  Unless I've overlooked or misunderstood
something it seems to me that the Yoneda Lemma should state that C is a
category of presheaves on J if and only if there exists a full,
faithful, and dense functor from J to C.

This should generalize the characterization of an Archimedean field as
any dense extension of the rationals.

Dear Makoto,

The Yoneda Lemma came to mind partly because of M. Barr and C. Wells book
"Toposes, Triples and Theories." Its Preface recounts that in the sense of
Lawvere's insight -- a mathematical theory corresponds "roughly to
the definition of a class
of mathematical objects" -- toposes, triples, and theories are
beautifully connected fundamental notions.

Barr-Wells write that the Yoneda Embeddings Theorem, "the first of
several important consequences" of the Yoneda Lemma, "in one way or
another is used in
practically every mathematical argument in this book." (p. 27)

Perhaps subscribers to this list would care to comment on how
specific results in this book apply or relate to computer science,
other areas of mathematics, logic, or physics.

All the best,
Ellis D. Cooper

Dear All

The Fundamental Theorem of Category Theory, to my mind, encompasses
all the facts surrounding the fact that the presheaf category PA is
the bicategorically free small-cocompletion of a small category A.
With my students I have always called it:

"The Whole Kan Business".

It can be expressed something like this:

Theorem. For each small category A and small-cocomplete category X,
left Kan extension along the Yoneda embedding y_A : A --> PA provides
an equivalence of categories

	[A,X] --> Cocts[PA,X]

where the codomain is the full subcategory of the functor category
[PA,X] consisting of the small-colimit-preserving functors. Moreover,
the value of the equivalence at j : A --> X has a right adjoint given
by x |--> X(j-,x).

Hi all categorists
=20
I am not an expert on oo-categories but i am sure there is a structure to

the "class" of all omega-categories. I hope all this will not depend on the

definition of an oo-category.


6>
Is the "class" of oo-categories of a certain recursive depth

always an oo-category of depth one higher than the previous depth?

I think yes for both strict and weak oo-categories.

=20

What should the "class" of all n-categories in Makkais foundation be called

to describe it technically accurately?

An oo-cosmos? in the categorical sense of a cosmos.

I am not sure but this "class" maby also contain all oo-categories.

=20

Are there different strict/weak n-categories with n any infinite ordinal

number omega?
omega does remind of an ordinal number.
The category need not to be accessible by forming categories of categories=
=2C

just satisfy some axioms of an strict/weak oo-category for oo=3Domega.

There might be a better definition of an omega-category if it is

necessary at all=2C i don't know.

=20

Dear Vaughan,

Your proposed characterization is actually a characterization of full
subcategories of [J^op,Set] containing the representables. To get the whole
presheaf category you should add that C is cocomplete, and that homming out
of objects in J is cocontinuous (i.e. C(j,-) is cocontinuous for all j in
J).

Steve.

When I lecture on category theory to first-year graduate students, I
tell them there are two things they should remember about the
Yoneda Lemma: it isn't a lemma, and it was never published by Yoneda.
In this respect it resembles that bulwark of the British constitution,
the Lord Privy Seal (who is none of the three things that his title
claims).

Version 2.0 of Easik has been released. Easik is a Java application with a
graphical environment for database design, and data entry and manipulation
using Entity-Attribute (EA) sketches.

EA sketches are the syntactic basis for the categorical Sketch Data Model
which extends and enhances the standard Entity-Relationship-Attribute data
model.

In the graphical interface, Easik supports design of EA sketches and their
export to an SQL database schema. The exported schema has triggers and
procedures to enforce the graphically specified constraints. Easik also
provides connectivity to the common open-source database management
systems MySQL and PostgreSQL

Version 2.0 enhancements include:
- multiple sketch editing through an overview
- support for views (subject to SQL limitations)
- data entry and manipulation from the the graphical interface.

The application is available at

http://mathcs.mta.ca/research/rosebrugh/Easik

or follow the link from

http://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/

Downloads include:
- user instructions
- an executable Java archive (jar) file
- Java source code
- example designs

The contributors to Easik are Robert Fletcher, Kevin Green, Vera Ranieri,
Jason Rhinelander, Andrew Wood and Robert Rosebrugh with support from
NSERC Canada and Mount Allison University.

Extensive information about the Sketch Data Model is in articles available
from the web pages of the poster and Michael Johnson.

We look forward to receiving comments and reports from users.

Right, that's what I meant by "*a* category of presheaves on J" (as
opposed to *the* category of all presheaves on J), the point of my
analogy with Archimedean fields (as opposed to the field of all reals).

> To get the whole

Right, just as to get all of the reals one should say that the
Archimedean field is complete.  For situations where one doesn't need
the whole thing it is convenient to be able to characterize the
categorical counterpart of an Archimedean field, with J in place of Q,
as any full, faithful and dense extension of J.  Density serves to keep
the extension inside [J^op,Set], just as it keeps Archimedean fields
inside R.

Am I missing something?  I was thinking that followed from density of J
in C.

Dear all,

I strongly agree to Ellis Gould's quote of Bill Lawvere's remark on the
Yoneda Lemma:

> -- a mathematical theory corresponds "roughly to
> the definition of a class
> of mathematical objects"

One of the most important points in category theory are universal
properties. The existence of universal solutions is equivalent to the
representability of certain functors - at least under reasonable smallness
conditions. This is closely related to the Yoneda Lemma; therefore it is
really one of the fundamental theorems to me.

                 2nd Call for Papers (Extended Abstracts)

        6th Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science, FICS 2009
                Coimbra, Portugal, 12-13 September 2009,
                    a satellite workshop of CSL 2009,
                  colocated with PPDP 2009, LOPSTR 2009


                        http://cs.ioc.ee/fics09/

Background

Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer
science and logic by justifying induction and recursive
definitions. The construction and properties of fixed points have been
investigated in many different frameworks such as: design and
implementation of programming languages, program logics,
databases. The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for
researchers to present their results to those members of the computer
science and logic communities who study or apply the theory of fixed
points. Previous workshops where held in Brno (1998, MFCS/CSL
workshop), Paris (2000, LC workshop), Florence (2001, PLI workshop),
Copenhagen (2002, LICS (FLoC) workshop), Warsaw (2003, ETAPS workshop).

Topics include, but are not restricted to:

    * categorical, metric and ordered fixed point models
    * fixed points in algebra and coalgebra
    * fixed points in languages and automata
    * fixed points in programming language semantics
    * the mu-calculus and fixed points in modal logic
    * fixed points in process algebras and process calculi
    * fixed points in the lambda-calculus, =

         functional programming and type theory
    * fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits
    * fixed points in logic programming and theorem proving
    * finite model theory, descriptive complexity theory, =

         fixed points in databases

Hi Reinhard,
when I entered category theory I must have gotten on the nerves of a
student of logic who found it necessary to point out to me that
universality is as good as one knows the ambient universe. That remark
came around to bite me once more when I recently pontificated that under
the same assumptions on a category S, under which NNO's in S imply that
the category of categories in S is monadic over the category of directed
graphs in S,  the converse would be true.
Dietmar (Schumacher)

the connection between n.t.(hom(A, -), hom(B, -)) and =

hom(B, A) in the case that the hom-sets are the =

It didn't take much, either, to see the underlying =

Hmm. Not sure if you mean you're allowing any full subcategory of

No. The category Setf of finite sets has a fully faithful dense inclusion in
to the (presheaf) category Set of all sets, but Set is not [Setf^op,Set].

I find this intersting, but I do not quite agree with Prof. Yoneda!

In order to challenge his claim, I would like to try making a list (which
I fear will not be "huge in variety") of some instances I know of in
mathematics where representable functors play central roles, and hope some
other people could do similar. While I know that I am not a particularly
well qualified person to write the part I am taking, I view this as a
great opportunity to share ideas from various different fields! (I hope
this is not off the topic of the list.)

- Given a category C of some mathematical objects, it is often equipped
with a "forgetful" functor C -> Set, so objects of C can be thought of as
sets equipped with some specific sort of structure. Let us call it a
C-structure. Then a C-structure on an object X of _any_ category can be
defined as a way to factorize the functor [ ,X], represented by X, through
the forgetful functor C -> Set. If C is the category of groups, then The
Lemma implies that giving a group structure on X is the same as giving
structure maps on X which are in analogy with the group operations for an
ordinary group. This readily generalizes for any sort of algebraic
structure, and this is related to Lawvere's notion of algebraic theories.
One can further replace the category Set with some other closed category
such as that of Abelian groups, using the language of enriched category
theory.

- Schemes in algebraic geometry can fruitfully be viewed as sheaves on the
opposite category Aff of that of commutative rings. Those schemes actually
represented by rings are called affine schemes. Thus, the category of
affine schemes is opposite to the category of rings, and is fully embedded
in the category of all schemes. The Yoneda lemma is a basic tool for the
study of schemes.

- Some presheaves on the category of (affine) schemes which fail to be
sheaves can more naturally be thought of as a groupoid-valued (rather than
set-valued) presheaves which can be represented by geometric objects
called algebraic stacks (which generalize schemes).

- Let G be a group (in a suitable category of "spaces"). In the theory of
principal bundles, the functor which assigns to a space X, the set of
principal G-bundles over X, modulo isomorphism, is represented (in the
homotopy category of spaces) by the so called classifying space BG of G.
That is, BG "classifies" principal G-bundles. Then The Lemma implies a
fundamental theorem that characteristic classes for bundles are the same
as cohomology classes of the classifying space.

- Similarly, one can consider the classifying stack of a group scheme
(i.e. scheme with group structure), in particular a finite group, G.

- Every spectrum, in the sense of stable homotopy theory, represents a
so-called generalized cohomology theory, and vice versa. The Lemma then
gives a way to compute natural operations between theories. The results of
computation of the algebra formed by operations on the "ordinary"
cohomology theory (with coefficients in a prime field), known by the name
the Steenrod algebra, is the input of the Adams spectral sequence, which
in turn computes (in principle) the stable homotopy groups of spheres,
which is of central interest in the field.

- On the category of commutative ring spectra, which are 'by definition'
spectra with commutative ring structure, the (covariant) functor
classifying characteristic classes, or "orientations", in the associated
multiplicative (because of the ring structure) generalized cohomology
theories is represented by the so-called Thom spectrum. Quillen pointed
out that the variant MU of Thom spectrum, classifying Chern classes, or
orientations for complex vector bundles, corresponds to the moduli stack
of formal groups (i.e. the stack classifying formal groups) thus
discovering a deep connection between homotopy theory and algebraic
geometry. MU has since been a key object in stable homotopy theory.

- One of the greatest recent achievements in algebraic topology is the
construction of a spectrum called tmf, the topological modular forms. It
is the global section of a certain sheaf of commutative ring spectra over
the moduli stack of elliptic curves. From this sheaf, one can recover the
Adams-type spectral sequence associated to tmf. According to Lurie, this
sheaf is actually the structure sheaf of the moduli stack classifying
"oriented elliptic curves" over commutative ring spectra, or, to be in the
correct variance, over derived affine schemes, in the world of derived
algebraic geometry. This extremely beautiful viewpoint enlightens the
meaning of Quillen's discovery just mentioned.

The disputed proposition (whether it is a theorem or a lemma) or its
appropriate generalization applies to any of these situations.

Another family of examples of representable functors would be supplied by
those represented by "dualizing objects" appearing in various contexts.
However, at this moment, I only have a vague idea of how the Yoneda lemma
would imply something useful in this situation. I think experts out there
are well in order to help me with this!

Concerning the discussion on the "fundamental theorem" of category theory,
it might worth remarking that preservation of limits by right adjoints
(and its dual) are a corollary of the more fundamental fact that adjoints
compose, granted uniqueness of the adjoint functor. The last is notably
one of the important consequences of The "Lemma".

Also, in addition to the claimed prominent applicability in mathematics,
the Yoneda lemma has remarkably neat and witty statement:
"Every presheaf represents itself."

Best wishes,
Takuo

By "category of presheaves on J" I had in mind retaining J as part of it.

Oops, right, I was mixing up cocomplete and cocompletion-of.  (Actually
I don't think in terms of either, I find it easier to think of
[J^op,Set] as the maximal dense extension of J up to equivalence, in the
sense that all dense extensions of J are full subcategories of it.)

Dear categorists,

Although I know this thread is basically over, I would like to thank
Paul Taylor for (earlier than my previous post) pointing out that not
every subject of mathematics has or should have its single "fundamental
theorem". While I think one theorem can be more important than another,
what may more worth discussing (still not necessarily here on the list)
could be what fundamental theorems are wanted for the future.

Best wishes,
Takuo

A cohomology group can easily be an infinite power of the coefficient
group. But such a group has a natural non-discrete topology, namely the
compact-open (which in this case is also the product topology).

Are there approaches to cohomology that, as part of the process, also
supply topologies on the cohomology groups?

[I'm trying to understand the topos-theoretic account of cohomology as
in Johnstone's "Topos Theory". But it looks heavily dependent on having
a classical base topos, since it uses the classical proof of sufficiency
of injectives (together with the existence of Barr covers) to deduce the
same property internally in any Grothendieck topos. For a more fully
constructive theory I wonder if one needs to take better care of the
topologies.]

Dear Categorists,

Does anyone know a name for the monad described below and/or whether
it has been studied?

Let k-Set denote the category of k-small sets (for some small regular
cardinal k).  For a set S, we denote by

T(S)=(k-Set \downarrow {S})

the set whose elements are pairs (K,f), where K is a k-small set and
f:K-->S is a function.  This construction is functorial in S.  I
claim that the endo-functor T: Set -->Set is a monad.  The identity
transformation S-->T(S) is given by "singleton set" and the
multiplication transformation TT(S)-->T(S) is given by Grothendieck
construction.

(There is a similar monad on Cat, where we replace k-Set with k-Cat.)

Does this monad T have a name?  Has it been studied?

Thank you,
David

This certain does happen--if E^* is a generalized cohomology theory, and X
is an infinite complex, we often want to topologize E^*(X) by the inverse
limit of the E-cohomology of the finite skeleta of X. This is why, for
example, if E is a complex-oriented cohomology theory, the E-cohomology of
infinite-dimensional complex projective space is a power series ring (and
not merely a polynomial ring), in one variable, over the coefficient ring
E^*.

This is sometimes important and useful in topology (for example, in the
situation above, where one uses the above description of E^*(CP^{\infty})
to associate a 1-dimensional formal group law to E), and sometimes it's
more just a hassle: for example, the early papers on the Adams-Novikov
spectral sequence used MU-cohomology (i.e., complex cobordism), and this
necessarily meant keeping track of the topology on MU^*(X) of various
spectra E, since for example MU^*(MU), the ring of stable natural
transformations of MU^*, has infinite homogeneous sums, and one had to
handle completed tensor products of MU^*(MU)-modules; the modern way is to
use generalized homology instead of generalized cohomology for these
generalized Adams spectral sequences, which does away with the topologies
and the need for completed tensor products (of course, the price one pays
is that one is then, in the case of MU, dealing with MU_*(MU)-comodules
rather than (topological) MU^*(MU)-modules, and computing Cotor rather
than Ext; but this seems to be worth it).

There's some discussion of this in Ravenel's green book. The paper on
unstable operations by Boardman, Johnson, and Wilson in the Handbook of
Algebraic Topology also includes some discussion and some nice
manipulations of topologies (again, coming from the finite skeleta of an
infinite complex) on some generalized cohomology rings and modules.

There are also generalized homology theories, like the Morava E-theories,
which occur as completions of other generalized homology theories, and so
E_*(X) naturally has a topology (coming from the completion) when E is one
of these theories; recent developments in stable homotopy theory make it
seem likely that there will be more such theories in our future.

Hope this is useful to you,
Andrew S.

I'm not sure if this is quite what you are looking for, but the topology on
cohomology theories is given as an inverse limit (if I have my limits the
correct way round) over the finite skeleta.  This has an impact, for example,
in the correct statement of the Kunneth theorem on cohomology of products (one
has to complete the tensor product with respect to the topology).

A fairly comprehensive and detail account is in Boardman and
Boardman+Johnson+Wilson in the Handbook of Algebraic Topology: MR1361889 and
MR1361900 (though it was known well before that).  These papers are available
online from Steve Wilson's homepage:

http://www.math.jhu.edu/~wsw/

(scan right down to the bottom).

Sarah Whitehouse and I also look at this in our paper 'The Hunting of the Hopf
Ring' (arxiv:0711.3722, to appear in HHA).

Very tentatively, I have a memory that Lefschetz in the 30s invented
linearly compact vector spaces (and proved that the "category" of them
was dual to the "category" of discrete vector space (this was before
categories) for the purpose of making cohomology more closely dual to
homology.

Having been cast in the role of Brutus -- saving the Republic of
Category Theory from the crowning of a Fundamental Theorem --
I would like to say that it's "Not that I lov'd Caesar less, but
that I lov'd Rome more".

Takuo Matsuoka, whom I thank for the undeserved compliment,
gave an excellent list of some of the applications of the Yoneda
embedding as a way of enriching categories in various mathematical
disciplines.   The first of these was about schemes in Algebraic
Geometry, which he has been explaining to me privately, despite
my long-term mental block on this subject.   Some of the following
was part of my response to him, but I don't want to put him under
pressure to be the spokesman for a subject that, as I discovered
later, is not actually his own.

So, this posting is addressed to algebraic geometers, synthetic
differential geometers, and others, to give a sketch of some of
the categorical techniques that have been developed for general
topology by domain theorists over the past two decades.  Whilst
their subjects manifestly have a richer history than domain theory
did, we now have a few new tricks that they seem to have missed.
However, I shall start with some textbook material.

The Yoneda Lemma is to category theory what Cayley's Theorem
is to groups.   An object of a category can be REPRESENTED by
the collection of all INCOMING morphisms (from all of the other
objects), just as a group can be represented by its permutation
action on itself.  This representation is faithful for the
tremendous but trite reason that an object is represented by
its own identity map.

Here is a syntactic example:  a type X in a lambda calculus is
represented by all of its terms, possibly involving free variables.
One such term is the single variable   x:X,  which is the
identity in the category.   The other objects of the category are
the other types, or, given that there may be many free variables,
the CONTEXTS, which are lists of typed variables.   In proof theory
the letter Gamma is used for a typical context.

This yields a presheaf whose value at Gamma is the set of terms
Gamma |- a:X  of type X, using only the variables from Gamma,
subject to the equivalence defined by the theory.   It defines
a contravariant functor in which the morphisms act by substitution.
This example is spelt out in detail in my book,  "Practical
Foundations of Mathematics", in particular in Section 7.7,
which describes categorical methods for proving normalisation,
conservativity, consistency, etc.

I use the letter Gamma for a typical object of ANY base category
(not just for a syntactic context but also for a topological space
or affine variety) over whose categories we may want to consider
presheaves.  In so far as there was a previous convention, it was
to use "U" (Juergen Koslowski suggested to me that this stood for
"Umgebung" = neighbourhood), "I" (for "index") or "-".

Since a presheaf is a family of SETS subject to some bookkeeping,
the huge advantage of the Yoneda embedding is that we can bring
the power of SET THEORY to bear on categorical problems.   (Rest
assured, you will see that I have not gone over to the Dark Side.)

For example, let f,g:X==>Y be parallel maps in a category C. The
object X is represented by the SETS   C(Gamma,X) of incoming maps,
so we can consider the SUBSET
                                         ---- f ---->
E(Gamma)={x|f.x=g.x}  >--->  C(Gamma, X)             C(Gamma,Y)
                                         ---- g ---->

of maps x:Gamma-->X that have equal composites with f and g.
Notice that these are the data for the universal propery of an
equaliser.  Indeed, the equaliser E>-->X==>Y exists in C iff
the presheaf E(-) is REPRESENTABLE, ie it is of the form C(-,E)
for some object E of C, which is unique up to unique isomorphism.

For this reason I also use the letter Gamma as the test object
FROM which maps come in any universal property.   I would urge
students to work through this method for exponentials too,
first writing down either their universal property or their
introduction and elimination rules.

In topos theory, another interesting presheaf is given by
the set  Sub(Gamma)  of "sieves"  on an object Gamma.   This
presheaf is representable iff the category C is a topos, and
the representing object is the subobject classifier Omega.
I this case, I invite you to work backwards from the definition
of the subobject classifier to find out what a "sieve" is.

In general, the Yoneda embedding preserves universal properties
such as limits that are given by maps FROM a generic object Gamma.

However, it completely DESTROYS the colimits in C, giving it
new ones instead.   Indeed, we can think of a presheaf as a
"formal" colimit diagram.

Now sheaf theory was invented to "PATCH" things together,
that is, to add COLIMITS such as pushouts.   But usually we
don't want to scrap the old colimits altogether, because some
of them were "already correct".  So, we specify which ones we
want to keep, and such a specification is called a GROTHENDIECK
TOPOLOGY.   Then, instead of using ALL presheaves, we just
keep the ones that respect our chosen "correct" colimits,
and call them SHEAVES.

In particular, we are quite often happy with the existing
COPRODUCTS in the base category.  In particular, these will be
stable and disjoint in any topos, but not the same under one
Grothendieck topology as under another, so if the ones that
we have in the original category already have this property
then they are probably correct.   Nowadays, a category with
nice finite coproducts is called EXTENSIVE;  topological spaces,
locales and affine varieties all enjoy this property.

Therefore, the colimits that we want to change are usually the
epis, coequalisers pushouts and filtered (=purely infinite) ones.

Presheaves may be adapted directly to the task of adding colimits
of a particular kind.   For example, Peter Johnstone describes
the "IND" construction that adds filtered colimits in Section VI.1
of "Stone Spaces".  In the dual category, this is how we obtain
profinite objects, which often come with a compact Hausdorff
but totally disconnected topology.

A Grothendieck topos is therefore a truly magnificent beast, but
it is a SET THEORY, whereas sheaves were originally introduced
to  study algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.  I want to
consider some ways in which it might be adapted to the construction
of a category that is actually like whichever subject we wanted
to study.

For various reasons we consider that the category of affine
varieties (the formal opposite of the category of commutative
rings) and the traditional category of topological spaces
are not rich enough for the requirements of their subjects.
For example, they are not cartesian closed.

So we introduce SCHEMES and (for example) EQUILOGICAL SPACES
to do a better job.   (Recall that I don't actually know what
a scheme is, though I have my guesses, and the reason for
spelling out all of this general category theory is to
elicit a definition that I can understand, in return for some
new techniques that algebraic geometers might find useful.)

It is not altogether surprising that the new categories are
represented as subcategories of the category of presheaves on
the old categories.   Since the NEW objects are conceived as
"patched together" from old ones,  they are, by design,
faithfully represented by the incoming maps from (all of)
the OLD objects.

Steve Vickers' posting of 9 June concerned presheaves on the
category of locales.  (Locales have very strong formal analogies
with affine varieties, being the formal opposite of a category
of algebras.)  My posting on the same day about "Aspects of
locale theory" is also relevant to this

Rather more people have studied subcategories of presheaves on
the category of topological spaces.  Pino Rosolini gave an
excellent survey of these categories in his 2000 paper on
"Equilogical spaces and filter spaces".   You can obtain this
and several other papers that provide many of the details of
what I am about to say from his webpage
       www.disi.unige.it/person/RosoliniG/biblio.html

Analogously to the "ind" construction above, Dana Scott's
equilogical spaces formally adjoin quotients of equivalence
relations to topological spaces, whilst Reinhold Heckmann's
construction of "equilocales" does the same for locales.

A Grothendieck topos is a set theory, but what in the construction
makes it so?   It is the requirement on the "correct colimits"
(Grothendieck topology) that they be stable under all PULLBACKS.
The SHEAFIFICATION functor that reflects presheaves to sheaves
also preserves all finite limits.

If we just want a CARTESIAN CLOSED category, rather than a topos,
it is enough that the data and reflection functor be preserved
by PRODUCTS, rather than general pullbacks.   The categories that
I shall describe all contain the base category but are contained
in the smallest category of sheaves, so it becomes irrelevant
whether we consider sheaves as intermediaries or go straight
from presheaves to the smaller category.

Along with several other people in the 1990s, Rosolini and
I studied ways of defining and constructing categories like these,
under the heading of SYNTHETIC DOMAIN THEORY (SDT).  This was
inspired by synthetic differential geometry, and I think Dana
Scott is responsible for the name.  However, most of the other
people who worked under this banner were interested in realisability
toposes rather than sheaf toposes, which was part of the reason
why I changed to a different name.

Key to this is the object SIGMA.  Like Omega, this classifies
subobjects, but now just OPEN ones in topology, or RECURSIVELY
ENUMERABLE ones in computation.  Rosolini identified the
abstract properties of a class of monos (or "dominion") and its
classifier ("dominance") in his PhD thesis.  My "Euclidean
principle",   Fx & x = FT & x,  puts it in an algebraic form --
see "Geometric and Higher Order Logic" on my webpage at
    www.PaulTaylor.EU/ASD/.

However, if algebraic or differential geometers want to pick this
idea up, they should not be misled by the idea of classifying
subobjects of any kind.   It is the algebraic property that
matters.   As a ring,  Sigma should be the ring of polynomials
in one variable.   As an affine variety, it is the geometric
incarnation of the ground field.

This means that, for an affine variety X, the set of maps X->Sigma
is (the underlying set of) the corresponding ring.  Similarly,
in topology it is the set of open subsets, ie the corresponding
frame.   The idea of ASD is that this "set" of maps should itself
be a space, but I don't know what this is for algebraic varieties.

Sigma is the spider at the centre of the web.  Considered as
a space, it carries the relevant algebraic structure (a lattice
or a ring), and maps  X-->Sigma  determine the structure of
other spaces X.   (Notice that this is the opposite way from
the maps Gamma-->X that motivated the category of presheaves.)

In synthetic domain theory we devised various properties, involving
maps X-->Sigma, that would say whether the presheaf X was to be
regarded as a "domain".   I am going to stick to those that can
be expressed in pure category theory and generalised to other
subjects.

The weakest one, a kind of T0 property, was that   X >---> Sigma^Y,
ie that the presheaf X be a subobject (family of subsets) of some
exponential.  (Recall that you constructed exponential presheaves
as an exercise earlier!)

A stronger one is that  X >---> Sigma^Y ====> Sigma^Z  as an
equaliser of such exponentials.

Usually there is a reflection functor from all presheaves to the
"domains", and this preserves products.

I forget exactly what was in each of Rosolini's papers, but
he studied the analogy between this reflection functor and
sheafification,  and also what happens in presheaf categories
over various interesting concrete categories.

Even with this modification of the notion of sheaf topos, the
Yoneda embedding and Grothendieck toposes have at best been
given the status of a "constitutional monarchy", so it is time
to introduce some genuinely republican ideas.

My programme "Abstract Stone Duality" moves away from the models
based on toposes to a direct axiomatisation of the subject that
we actually want to study.  This axiomatisation consists of two
parts -- some pure category theory and some specifically topological
axioms on top of it.   The reason why I believe ASD could be
adapted to other subjects is that the topological axioms say
little more than that Sigma is a lattice, so this could be replaced
by a ring.   MOST of the work is done by the underlying category
theory, and this will be even more strongly so in the developments
of the theory that I am currenly studying.

In ASD, I concentrate on powers of Sigma, rather than of general
objects, and other structure that can be defined in these terms.
The version of my theory that is reasonably well established
starts from the hypothesis that the adjunction Sigma^(-) -| Sigma^(-)
be MONADIC.

The result of this is an account of computably based locally
compact spaces and computable continuous functions.

I applied this to elementary real analysis, and obtained a computable
construction of the Dedekind reals in which [0,1] is compact ---
contrary to the received wisdom of Russian Recursive Analysis that
this is impossible, and to Bishop's constructive analysis, which
develops a lot of the subject in a "can do" fashion but without
using compactness of [0,1].

The problem with this theory is that, rather than enlarging the
traditional category to a cartesian closed one that is embedded in
a category of presheaves, it cuts down to locally compact spaces.

However, I am currently writing up a new technique that replaces
the monadic assumption.  In one manifestation,  it gives an account
of all sober topological spaces and continuous functions.  However,
since it says that products preserve epis,  it doesn't work for
locales, because of the counterexample that I gave in my "aspects
of locale theory" posting.

On the other hand, this DOES work for affine varieties -- over a
field, because the same problem with locales arises if you try to
work over a general commutative ring.   (It comes down to whether
modules are FLAT,  ie tensor product with them preserves monos.)

I talked about "illegitimate" presheaves in my "categories"
posting on "aspects of locale theory", and Steve Vickers said
something on the same topic.   Set-theoretic issues aside,
presheaves are "heavyweight" gadgets in that you have to give
data pertaining to every object of the base category, so a
scheme is defined by its relationship to ALL rings.

I am offering a much more "lightweight" construction.  In this,
to give an object of the new category (a "scheme", maybe) would
involve only a handful of objects and morphisms of the original
one (rings).

This "lightweight" construction will give an account of equilogical
spaces (with some of their more set-theoretic features removed).
I would like to know what the relationship is between the analogous
result that I have for algebraic varieties, and whatever the official
definition of SCHEME is in algebraic geometry.

My category of "schemes" (if that is what it is) would be embedded
in the presheaf category and closed therein under finite limits
and exponentials.   It would contain all affine varieties, along
with their products, equalisers, pullbacks, coproducts and epis
but not coequalisers (coproducts, coequalisers, pushouts, products
and monos but not equalisers of rings).

The (possible) difference from the existing notion of scheme is
that I would give you the SMALLEST category of presheaves that
has these properties.

Along with this would come a "synthetic" and computable
axiomatisation similar to the one that I give for elementary
real analysis in
      www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/lamcra/elemcalc

Finally, why is the Yoneda Lemma not a Theorem?   Because Lemmas
do the work in mathematics, whilst Theorems, like royalty,
just take the credit.

Thank you for listening.

I don't think this construction works at the level of sets rather than
categories. The problem is that k-Set is a category, not a set, so T(S)
also has a category structure, and you can't simply "forget" this. If
you do, then you have the problem "*which* singleton set?" for the
unit (i.e., which singleton set do you choose as the domain of the
functions 1 --> S which you identify with elements of S?), and
whichever choice you make you are going to run into problems verifying the
monad identities.

This is correct, and it's well-known: it is the monad which freely adjoins
k-small coproducts to a category.

Not really a contribution to the mathematical question, but I'm struck by
the fact that both Andrew Salch and Andrew Stacey, in their replies to
Steve Vickers, use the plural "skeleta". I used to do that when I was a
student, as a way of winding-up my teachers, but it isn't justifiable.

The English word "skeleton" is indeed derived from a Greek root (the
past participle of the verb "skellein", to wither or dry up), but it
doesn't exist as a noun in Greek. There is therefore no justification
for giving it an imagined Greek plural. Having in my time devoted some
effort to fighting the bogus (but in fact more justifiable) Greek
plural "topoi", I feel bound to protest against this one too.

Dear David

I'm not sure whether your specific construction has been looked at or
named, but it is a "submonad" of something very well known.

Let's work with 2 universes of sets, your "Set" being the topos of small
sets, and SET being a topos of sets large enough to include {arrows of
Set} as an object. For those not so comfortable doing this, fix two
regular cardinals far enough part, read "Set" as "the category of sets of
cardinality less than the smaller cardinal", and "SET" as "the category o=
f
sets of cardinality less than the bigger one", and far enough apart means
Set is a category internal to SET.

Now the 2-category CAT (of category objects in SET) contains Set as an
object so one may form the slice 2-category

CAT/Set

in the strictest sense (1-cells being triangles commuting on the nose).
The big brother of your monad is a 2-monad on this 2-category. The
endofunctor part does the following:

S:A-->Set   |-->  Set \downarrow S --> Set

This is the underlying monad of what could be called the "fibration"
2-monad. That is applying to a functor produces the free split fibration
on what you started with. This construction works at the following
generality: replace CAT by any 2-category with comma objects and Set by
any object therein, and the first paper to see fibrations as algebras of =
a
monad in this way was

R. Street "Fibrations and yoneda's lemma in a 2-category" SLNM 420 1974

The relation between your monad and this one is that there's a canonical
inclusion

Set --> CAT/Set

which regards any Set S as a functor S:1-->Set, and this functor is the
1-cell data for a monad morphism (in the sense of Street: "Formal theory
of monads") from your monad to the monad I described.

With best regards

Mark Weber

The Yoneda Lemma is in fact a particular case of the reflections of Cat/X i=
n discrete (op)fibrations over X (the reflection of an object x:1->X gives =
the slice X/x -> X, which corresponds to the representable X(-,x));
another particular case (X=3D1), gives the components of a category.
The above reflections are a consequence of the "comprehensive" factorizatio=
n systems (final functors, discrete fibrations) and (initial functors, disc=
rete opfibrations) on Cat.
It turns out that several aspects of category theory can be developed in an=
y finitely complete category C with two factorization systems properly rela=
ted (the main axiom is "reciprocal stability").
Thus category theory can be indeed founded on (a generalization of) the Yon=
eda Lemma; in particular, in this perspective, universal properties inside =
C depend on the universal properties which follow from the factorization sy=
stems.

Eduard Cech center had been established in 2005 as the national research
center focusing its attention to interactions between algebra, geometry, and
logic (and their applications in cryptology, computer science, etc.). It
is jointly operated by mathematicians from Masaryk University in Brno,
Charles University in Prague and Academy of Sciences of the Czech
Republic, with offices both in Brno and Prague.

The Center invites applications for several research positions
for the year 2010 commencing at the date depending on mutual agreement.
The candidates must be recent PhD's that obtained their degree not earlier
than 2 years before submitting this application.

Candidates should submit a letter of application accompanied by a CV,
list of publications and an outline of their research project to
Professor Jan Slovak (slovak@muni.cz) not later than August 10, 2009.
They should also arrange for at least 2 letters of recommendation (one can
be from a Czech mathematician) to be mailed directly to slovak@muni.cz
before August 20, 2009. The successful applicants will be notified as soon
as possible, we hope the decision will be taken by September 20, 2009.

Has anyone generalised the theory of (weak) triquotient assignments
from locale maps to geometric morphisms? In particular, does the
pullback (assuming boundedness) of a geometric morphism with a
triquotient assignment have a unique triquotient assignment satisfying
the Beck-Chevalley condition?

Also, if f:X->Y is a continuous function between topological spaces,
are there any reasonable conditions (other than openness) under which
the interior of the direct image along f is a weak triquotient
assignment for the inverse image map?

Thanks,

Barney.

As Peter Johnstone also emphasized in his reply, the construction which =20
David Spivak describes,
namely "T(S)=3D(k-Set \downarrow {S})",  is really a part of a well known=
=20
"monad" on the category of categories: if S is any category, T(S) is the=20
free cocompletion of S under k-small coproducts. It is only a monad up=20
to canonical isomorphisms, because coproducts are not in general=20
strictly associative. This cocompletion "monad"  under coproducts has=20
been widely studied under the name "Fam" (because T(S) is the category=20
of k-small Families of objects in S). It is an example of a KZ monad.

However,  replacing k-Set by k-Cat provides a monad on Cat which is not=20
KZ; David observes:

"(There is a similar monad on Cat, where we replace k-Set with k-Cat.)"

and Peter's reply to this:

"This is correct, and it's well-known: it is the monad which freely adjoi=
ns
k-small coproducts to a category. "

does not apply here (it slipped into the wrong place of his reply):=20
rather, David's "similar monad" is trying to provide free cocompletion=20
under colimits indexed by k-small categories, but does not, until you=20
make a category-of-fractions construction on its values. My University=20
of Chicago thesis (1967) described this way of making free cocompletions.

This "similar monad" (before doing the fractions-part) has  been studied=20
by Guitart, he calls it this monad DIAG. Reference: Guitart, Ren=E9,=20

I assume you mean to take such pairs (K,f) up to isomorphism, or else,
as Peter Johnstone has already pointed out, your construction will not
be well-defined. For instance, even the finite sets may form a proper
class, depending on your underlying set theory.

In the case where k=omega, T is the well-known finite multiset monad,
which associates to each S the free commutative monoid generated by S
(whose elements are also known as finite multisets in S).

For other k, I would call this the "monad of multisets of size less
than k". I think this works for any infinite small cardinal, not just
regular ones.

I see that Takuo and I have still not overcome the "royalist" forces.

Claudio, Vaughan, Ross and others have mentioned various more
"sophisticated" versions of the Yoneda Lemma.

However, I contend that the more sophisticated the result is,
the LESS it deserves to be called "the fundamental theorem of
category theory".

I particularly like Euclid's algorithm for the highest common
factor as a historical and methodological example,   Without
meaning to dictate to number theorists how their subject should
be organised, let me suggest for the sake of argument that it
is a pretty good candidate for being called the "fundamental
theorem of number theory".

Gauss used the same idea to factorise polynomials, and no doubt
number theorists have many more "sophisticated" developments of it.

But the principal idea was Euclid's (or one of his colleagues),
not Gauss's, and definitely not that of any subsequent number
theorist!

Saunders Mac Lane said something about "the right" generality,
as opposed to the greatest generality.

As I say, I like Euclid's algorithm because the idea has
survived many many revolutions in the "official" foundations
of mathematics.

Theorems, like royalty, are rightly the victims of revolutions,
because the way in which we encapsulate a piece of theory as
a "theorem" depends as much on our current cultural prejudices
as it does on the real underlying mathematics.

For example, there is Cantor's "theorem" about a powerset being
strictly bigger than a set.  This belongs entirely to the dogma
of set theory.  When set theory is overturned, this miserable
and wholely misguided "theorem" will go in the dustbin of
mathematical history with it.

But Euclid's algorithm will live forever.

And the Yoneda Lemma will survive as long as Category Theory
does in a recognisable form.

But it still shouldn't be called the "fundamental theorem"!

Paul

Peter Johnstone is right -- the monad David described doesn't exist, thus
neither does the monad morphism I described in my other post (... sorry!)=
.
Perhaps the fibrations monad is still of interest.

One could fix a skeleton of Set_k, and for k =3D cardinality of natural
numbers this works fine, and the monad on Set you get is the monoid monad=
.
However for bigger k you're likely to run into problems when trying to do
this sort of thing.

However it isn't true that the monad

>> (... on Cat, where we replace k-Set with k-Cat.)

is the k-coproduct completion monad -- you need to keep k-Set but work in
Cat and take lax slices, ie take the monad on Cat which has underlying
endofunctor

X |-> k-Set // X

(where // means "lax slice") to get the k-coproduct completion monad.

The generic-seeming example "phenomenon/phenomena" certainly *suggests*
a parallel "skeleton/skeleta" -- but it would also suggest "polygon/polyg=
a",
which I think we all would agree is nonsense. Peter is merely (justifiabl=
y)
pointing out that "skeleton/skeleta" is as much nonsense as "polygon/poly=
ga",
and I'm with him 100% on that score.

[As for the plural of "topos", I guess I'm in the mugwump camp that would=

*write* it as "topoi" (pace Peter), but *pronounce* it as "toposes" :-) .=

English was never very strong at phonetic consistency of pronunciation;
witness GBShaw's "phonetic" spelling of FISH: "ghotip".]

Cheers, -- Fred

PS: "ghotip"? "gh" as in COUGH, "o" as in WOMEN, =

"ti" as in NATION, and "p" (silent) as in PNEUMONIA.

As far as I am aware, no generalisation of localic triquotient assignments =
to geometric morphisms has been developed. That's not for want of trying on=
 my part!

A na=EFve approach would be to define a weak triquotient assignment on a ge=
ometric morphism f:F->E to be a filtered colimit preserving functor that is=
 required to interact with the inverse image of f in a manner that mimics t=
he localic case. For this approach to work in a way that is similar to what=
 happens for locales we would need to have a similar way of characterising =
such filtered colimit preserving functors which, as far as I am aware, is n=
ot available (essentially due to the technical difficulty that sheafificati=
on is 'two step' for toposes, but only 'one step' for locales). The technic=
al problems here are, in my mind, the same as the more well known problems =
associated with constructing an upper power topos.=20

My current view on how to solve this problem is to use localic representati=
ons of geometric morphisms. This requires us to re-state the theory of geom=
etric morphisms as adjunctions between categories of locales and to develop=
 'topos theory' relative to these adjunctions. For example 'Grothendick top=
os' becomes 'category of localic diagrams of a localic groupoid' in this pa=
radigm. The lower power topos construction should guide us to see how its a=
ction effects (the category of actions of) localic groupoids; then by upper=
/lower symmetry we know what the 'upper' case should be (and hence to weak =
triquotient assignments on geometric morphisms). Unfortunately getting the =
symmetry to work even at the much simpler level of bounded geometric morphi=
sms is proving a headache.=20

If you would like any further detail, please feel free to get in touch.=20

Subject: categories: Triquotient assignments for geometric morphisms

Has anyone generalised the theory of (weak) triquotient assignments
from locale maps to geometric morphisms? In particular, does the
pullback (assuming boundedness) of a geometric morphism with a
triquotient assignment have a unique triquotient assignment satisfying
the Beck-Chevalley condition?

Also, if f:X->Y is a continuous function between topological spaces,
are there any reasonable conditions (other than openness) under which
the interior of the direct image along f is a weak triquotient
assignment for the inverse image map?

Thanks,

Barney.

I expected my term to be slightly controversial, but didn't realise what
depth of feeling existed on the subject!

So, while I thank everyone for the very enlightening discussion of
Yoneda's Lemma, and Paul for his thoughts on Fundamental Theorems, I'd
like to ask: is there another name I can use for the theorem that right
adjoints preserve limits and left adjoints preserve colimits that's (a)
a bit less of a mouthful than that and (b) emphasises the result's
importance and applicability?

There is a very nice paper by Lawvere that shows that the essence of
Cantor's theorem is fundamental and beautiful:

You really do need the regularity. Otherwise removing
brackets from a k-small multiset of k-small multisets might
yield something bigger than a k-small multiset, and then one
cannot define a multiplication for the monad.

Dear Barney,

The weak triquotient assignments go along with the double powerlocale
monad PP, since a weak triquotient assignment for f: X -> Y is a map g:
Y -> PP(X) satisfying certain conditions that relate to the strength of
PP. I believe Townsend has published some work on this.

This is similar to how open maps go along with the lower powerlocale P_L
(see my "Locales are not pointless"), though with P_L it is made tighter
using an adjunction that is not available in the PP case, so the open
analogue of triquotient assignment, the map from Y to P_L(X), is
characterized uniquely.

For open maps we know of a trivial generalization to toposes: a
geometric morphism is open if its localic part is an open locale map.
You could probably play the same trick with triquotient assignments, and
 then I think your stability property follows from stability of the
hyperconnected-localic factorization.

However, there is also a more interesting generalization in the case of
open maps, got by generalizing P_L to the symmetric topos construction
M. (This is described in the Elephant, but also, in much more detail, in
the Bunge-Funk book "Singular coverings of toposes". See also my paper
"Cosheaves and connectedness in formal topology".) In fact, Bunge and
Funk have proved that for a locale X, P_L(X) is the localic reflection
of M(X). The relationship between P_L and open maps transfers to one
between M and locally connected geometric morphisms.

Since PP is the composite of (commuting) monads P_U and P_L, where P_U
is the upper powerlocale, one natural approach to a topos generalization
would be try also to generalize P_U.

This generalization seems to be missing in our current state of
knowledge, though I've had some thoughts about it and firmly believe
that it exists.

Regards,

Steve.

Yes, and this illustrates the distinction that I am trying to make
between Lemmas that do the work and Theorems that take the credit.

Lawvere's argument is a Lemma about fixed points that has many uses
elsewhere.  I might even stretch to crediting Cantor with a good
idea, since it reappeared as Turing's insolubility of the halting
problem and Goedel's incompleteness theorem.

As a Theorem, on the other hand, Cantor's result was the basis of
the theory of cardinality,  which was more or less immediately
recognised as being completely useless for ordinary mathematical
purposes such as distinguishing between R^2 and R^3.  It is dogma.

As I said, we use "Theorems" to summarise how a piece of work fits
into the currently prevailing mathematical dogma.   When that dogma
changes, the Theorems go out of the window, but the Lemmas survive,
being reorganised in a new way according to the new dogma.

To give an example in category theory, it is a Theorem that a certain
structure is the "classifying category" or "classifying topos"
for some theory, because this terminology comes from a particular
world view.  However, the same underlying calculations have been
organised in different ways under different names (such as "clone"
and "Lawvere theory") in the past, and will be reorganised in other
ways in the future.

The thing that makes Mathematics interesting is that there is
something there that is essentially independent of the world view
according to which it is currently organised.  In approaching
a particular topic, you can choose the Definitions one way and
then have to prove a particular Theorem, or go round the circle
the other way, rewriting the Theorem as the Definition and proving
a different Theorem.   But when you look carefully at the two versions,
you realise that the same Lemma is there either way.

I used to illustrate this with Galois Theory, but I regret that
I can no longer remember that beautiful subject sufficiently
clearly to do so now.

Instead, I gave a more prosaic example in Section 1,2 of my book,
called the Lineland Army.   (As a Theorem, it is the free monad
on a monoid.)  You can approach it as a pure mathematician would,
using equivalence classes, in which case the Theorem says that
its binary operation is associative.  Or you can approach it as
a theoretical computer scientist would, and prove a normalisation
Theorem.  But either way there is the same Lemma.

In a particular topic, therefore, rather than in a whole discipline
such as category theory, there may well be a Fundamental Lemma --
the one thing that you have to prove, whichever way you go round
the circle.   But I think we should wrap up this thread now.

> There is also a post by Andrej Bauer in his Mathematics and
> Computation blog:

Funny you should mention this, because I was going to cite it for
a completely different reason.

Andrej originally posted this to FOM, but it was censored, and he
received a "referee's report" from the "editorial board".

Those who have been anywhere near FOM will know of its notoriety.
For example, two categorical logicians who attempted to engage with
set theorists there c1998 were on the receiving end of a lot of
personal abuse from one specific person.   I have heard similar
stories from about four other sources in completely unrelated
disciplines.  In particular, some of us recently attempted to
discuss some points of constructive real analysis there.

I have to be careful in posing my question, otherwise I will get
a mailbox full of examples of dogma, abuse and censorship.

On "categories" we ask questions, advertise our work and discuss
issues of research and professional matters.  Set theorists
appear to do the same on FOM, but the list is called "Foundations
of Mathematics" and not "Set Theory".   In both cases I expect
that there are isolated graduate students for whom these lists
are their one contact with the outside world and source of
information about mathematical research.   FOM ought to provide
them with a diversity of points of view, as "categories" does.

Has anyone EVER managed to discuss constructive mathematics,
type theory, categorical logic, or any other "heretical" topic,
on FOM, in a professional way, without being shouted down or
censored?   Please reply privately, and don't copy long postings
or "referee's reports" to me.  Just tell me briefly the month in
which the exchange took place and who participated in it, then
I can look it up myself in the FOM archive.

Let me second Paul's observation.  Going from the Yoneda lemma to a more
sophisticated version would be analogous to saying that the Fundamental
Theorem of calculus is "really" Stokes's theorem in its most general form
(that the integral of form over the boundary of an n-dimensional compact
region is the integral of the differential of the form over the region).
The point of fundamental theorems is that they are easy to state and
somehow capture something essential about the subject.  The original
Yoneda lemma states that all the properties of an object are present in
its homfunctor.  Thus objects are really captured by the morphisms.  That
it then leads to very sophisticated extensions is the point, but it, not
they, are the basis for it all.

Dear All

To add to the confusion:

There is a difference between skeleton and polygon:

skeletos, etc. is a participle

polygon is a noun

polygonon in ancient Greek
polygono in modern Greek

plural form polygona in ancient Greek

>From my recollections:
as a participle (I would have to check this):
skeletos, skeletae, skeleton etc.,

the neutrum  participle "skeleton" also has plural forms:

skeleta (nominativ)
skeleton (genitiv) (long o, i.e. omega)
skeletois (dativ)
skeleta (accusativ)

I cannot check details right now since I
cannot chek my ancient Greek sources right now to confirm.

Best regards

Johannes

My teacher of category theory calls the first of these two theorems
RAPL. Maybe he can explain whether he picked it up from someone.
Somehow, LAPC does not sound so good.

Hi Christopher & Steve, thanks for your replies.

The version I need is the generalisation of open & proper morphisms
(i.e. some kind of map  f_*\Omega_F  -> \Omega_E) rather than the
generalisation of locally connected & tidy morphisms (some kind of
functor F -> E). As Steve says, I think the results I want follow from
the stability of the hyperconnected-localic factorisation, but I was
hoping someone had written out the details in the style of sections
C3.1 & C3.2 of the Elephant. Looks like I'll have to do it myself.

Barney.

Mark Weber says rightly about David Spivak's "monad"
(and it applies to its natural extension to the "cocompletion under k-small coproducts-monad" on Cat as well):

"One could fix a skeleton of Set_k, and for k = cardinality of natural
numbers this works fine, and the monad on Set you get is the monoid monad.
However for bigger k you're likely to run into problems when trying to do
this sort of thing."

Yes, you do run into problems; however, they can be solved, as I showed in my Chicago thesis 1967. Namely, take for Set_k the (small) full subcategory of Sets whose objects are the  ORDINAL numbers of cardinality less than the regular cardinal k. Ordinal sum formation then allows you to get the multiplication of the monad to be strictly associative.

Similarly for the "similar monad" mentioned by David
(based on the Grothendieck-construction of categories) - this monad is also in my thesis, and Lawvere reports on it in his "Ordinal sums and equational doctrines", (Seminar on Triples, SLN 80 (1969), see p.152-153. ).

However, these cunning tricks to get strict associativity were in the 1960s forced on us, for historical reasons:  at that time we did not have the notion of 2-dimensional category well enough established to see these cocompletion "monads" in their true 2-dimensional nature.

The "similar monads", based on a suitable Cat_k, are also reported on in loc.cit.; and Cat_k could be replaced by any small category Cat_0 of categories which is stable under the Grothendieck construction, like the category of k-small posets, or of k-small directed categories. (I called these monads  "prelimit monads"; Lawvere calls them Dir_Cat_0. They also appear in Guitart's 1974-article, as referenced in my previous posting.)

I don't see how supplying the missing half of an if-and-only-if is "more
sophisticated."  The Yoneda Lemma usually states that J embeds (meaning
fully) in [J^op,Set], but it could just as well state this for any
factor C between J and [J^op,Set].  In such situations it is natural to
ask whether the converse holds; it doesn't, but if one adds to
full-and-faithful the (very natural) requirement of density then it
does: the dense extensions of J are precisely the categories of
presheaves on J, by which I mean the full subcategories of [J^op,Set]
that retain J as a full subcategory (the sense of "on").  I don't call
that sophisticated.

Indeed.  Any branch of mathematics that does so only contributes to the
image of mathematics as a difficult subject.

That's an algorithm.  The relevant theorem is also called the
fundamental theorem of arithmetic.  One could state the essential idea
in sophisticated language as "Z is a principal ideal domain" but the
more usual statement about uniqueness of factorization of positive
integers makes number theory a more accessible subject.

I like Cantor's theorem because, like Euclid's algorithm, it will
survive the revolution Paul is trying to foment here.

As will diagonalization arguments like Cantor's.

Unlike the Fundamental Theorems of Arithmetic and of Algebra, the Yoneda
Lemma has not yet established itself as *the* fundamental theorem of
category theory.  Nor will it unless a reasonable consensus to that
effect emerges.  I suggest waiting a few years before coming to any
conclusion about whether CT has an FT, and if so what it is.

Of course, the proof that the object x:1->X (of Cat/X) has the slice  X/x -=

ntially the same of that of the standard Yoneda lemma, and the general case=
 only requires a little more effort.
My point is that this formulation seems to me more in the "categorical spir=
it", stating a universal property that relates categories over X and discre=
te fibrations.
In fact the paradigm "categories, functors and natural transformations" can=
 be in part replaced by "categories, functors and discrete (op)fibrations";=
 for instance a colimit x of the object p:P -> X of Cat/X is a reflection o=
f p in slices over X, where the reflection map p -> X/x in Cat/X is the col=
imiting cone, and so on.
Furthermore, there is a clear analogy (which can be made precise with the p=
roper choice of factorization system on posets) with the reflection of the =
subsets of a poset X in lower or upper sets of X (the principal sieves bein=
g a particular case).

Dear Vaughan,

The usual statement is significantly stronger than that (see e.g. Mac
Lane, Mac Lane and Moerdijk, or Wikipedia). It says that, for
contravariant functors F: C -> Set, the elements of FX are in bijection
with transformations to F from the representable functor for X. Your
statement can be deduced by considering the particular case where F too
is representable.

(To put it another way, the representable presheaf for X is freely
generated - as presheaf - by a single element (the identity morphism) at
X. This then allows you to calculate the left adjoint of the forgetful
functor from presheaves over C to ob(C)-indexed families of sets.)

There can be no doubt that this strong Yoneda Lemma is vitally important
when calculating with presheaves - for example, it shows immediately how
to calculate exponentials and powerobjects. If F and G are two
presheaves, then the exponential G^F is calculated by

   G^F(X) = nt(Y(X), G^F)    (by Yoneda's Lemma)
          = nt(Y(X) x F, G)  (by definition of exponential)

I don't think you can get it and its useful consequences from your
weaker statement, even if you start strengthening yours in the way you
suggest by supplying converses.

Another closely related and important result, though not known as
Yoneda's Lemma as far as I know, is that the presheaf category over C is
a free cocompletion of C, and the Yoneda embedding is the injection of
generators.

(By the way, I agree that category theory doesn't have to have a
Fundamental Theorem. I haven't see any compelling reason to appoint one.)

Regards,

Steve.

All,

This is an argument about effective theories and so i would love to hear
from the topos-theory crowd. i'll state the argument in lowly computational
terms, using two distinct proposals for foundational models of computing:
the lambda calculus and the =F0-calculus. Both the lambda calculus and the
=F0-calculus suffer a dependence on a theory of names (aka variables). Both
require two things of whatever theory of names is provided to them:

   - at least countably infinitely many names
   - an effective equality on names

Now, to this recent proposals[1] add a third constraint, namely

   - names are atomic -- they have no internal structure

To my way of thinking these three constraints are incompatible. i cannot se=
e
how to make an effective equality on a countably infinite set of entities
that have no internal structure on which to rest the equality check. It
seems to me that the only possible expression of the equality is an infinit=
e
table which states the results of comparing every single pair of atoms --
which is not going to fit into any realizable model of computation of which
i'm aware and understand.

Is there a way around this? If there is, i would be eternally grateful to b=
e
enlightened.

The reason i focus on foundational proposals for theories of computation is
that one could drop the atomic requirement and allow names to have internal
structure, but because of the other two constraints one is dangerously clos=
e
to sneaking into a supposedly foundational account a theory of names that i=
s
-- itself -- already sufficiently rich to model computation. (For example,
in many implementations of lambda or =F0-calculus, names are ultimately
represented as integers.) This would appear to undermine the foundational
character of the model of computation in question. This has led me to
constructions in which the internal structure of names *reflects* the
structure of computations. In fact, this idea has a simple monadic
characterization, but that's for another discussion.

i've already posted to this list an intuitive account of red/black set
theories that also side-step the issue of atoms with no structure which
allows to recast the FM-Set-Theory-based accounts of names onto what appear=
s
to me to be the only construction that meets all the requirements mentioned
above: sufficiently many names, effective equality, restricting internal
structure of names to the structure of the proposal at hand. Again, if ther=
e
is a way to skate around this argumentation or debunk it, please consider
this a sincere call for help to do so.

Best wishes,

Dear Gregory,

I think the problem resides in what you mean by "no internal structure".
If by this you mean that the *set* of names has no internal structure,
then it's obviously impossible -- to require the set to have decidable
equality is to impose internal structure on it. But it's still possible
for the names themselves to be atomic: you can identify the set of names
with the set of natural numbers (which has lots of internal structure,
including decidable equality) without identifying the individual names
with von Neumann-style natural numbers (or Russell-style cardinals,
or ...)

The draft paper advertised above investigates these ideas.

This work was part of a re-formulation of Dana Scott's equilogical
space construction about which you can find three sets of slides
at www.PaulTaylor.EU/slides/ and the details will follow shortly.

My lengthy posting on "Applications of the Yoneda embedding"
on 20 June 2009 also provides background material for this.

However, it has turned out to be very fruitful to leave the CCC
aside and first consider the properties of a category that "lies
nicely" within its cartesian closed extensions.  The categories
of sets, of sober topological spaces (in the textbook sense) and of
affine varieties have the appropriate properties.  However, because
of the counterexample that I gave in "Aspects of locale theory"
on 9 June 2009, the category of locales does not (products do not
preserve epis).

As I suggested in 2007, the key idea is to study equalisers
targeted at exponentials.   In terms of the Yoneda embedding,
if we have a pair of maps from a representable presheaf to
the exponential (Sigma^-) of another representable, is the
equaliser representable too?  We can reformulate this in the
original category, without using presheaves, as a (kind of)
PARTIAL PRODUCT.   The categories of sets, topological spaces
and affine varieties have these partial products.

(I would like to thank Andrea Schalk, Mike Barr and possibly
Robin Cockett for joining me in banging our heads against the
brick wall of trying to find out whether locales have them too.
Probably they don't, but I'm not sure whether it is this or
something else that goes wrong.)

An EQUIDEDUCTIVE CATEGORY is one that has finite limits,
(my) partial products, an object Sigma that is injective wrt
the monos that arise from partial products, and enough injectives.
It turns out that those objects A that have exponentials Sigma^A
are SOBER in my abstract sense, and the adjunction Sigma^- -| Sigma^-
on this subcategory is monadic.

In other words we have the characteristic properties of the
subcategory of locally compact spaces within the category of
sober topological spaces, without assuming any structure on Sigma
such as being a lattice.

EQUIDEDUCTIVE LOGIC captures this categorical structure in symbolic
form.  It is a predicate calculus whose object language is the
sober lambda calculus.  The chief feature is a quantified implication
that justifies the (recursive) notation
      E = { x:A | All y:B. q(y) => fxy=gxy }
for the equaliser   E >--> A ====> Sigma^Y    where  Y = {b:B | q(y)}.

Note that the predicates that are defined by this logic are general
subobjects, not terms of type Sigma^A.

Using quantification over terms of type Sigma^A, one can define an
"existential quantifier".  This is the most striking aspect of
equideductive logic:  although this is an old idea (maybe due to
Russell) from higher order logic, it turns out to characterise
the EPIs in the category, which have to be preserved by products.

Of course, epis need not be surjective.   For example  N-->>X is
epi amongst sober spaces, where X is the domain of ascending
natural numbers, with T=oo.   This means that one has to be
EXTREMELY careful in using this quantifier -- it only has a
restricted Frobenius law and doesn't allow substitution -- but
I think that it will turn out to be very useful.  For example,
Scott continuity can be expressed in the form that, for phi:Sigma^N,
"there exists" a finite set S such that  phi n <=> n in S.
What this means is that it is sufficient to test this case when
proving equality of terms of type Sigma.

We recover topology (in the style of ASD) by requiring SOME of
these quantifiers to agree with structure on Sigma.  That is,
a space {x:A|p(x)}  is compact or overt if the PREDICATE given
by quantification of a term of type Sigma^A agreed with another
term of type Sigma.

On the other hand, and coming back to the question at the top
of this posting, we recover set theory (ie an elementary topos)
by requiring ALL quantifiers to agree with operators on Sigma.

I trust that I will not hear any further repetition of the claim
that ASD is restricted to locally compact spaces.  This paper
essentially replaces "Subspaces in ASD" and the monadic lambda
calculus.  It also fills in several gaps in other papers, such
as allowing equational hypotheses and constructing the compact
and overt subspaces that are described by modal operators.

Hi,
Yes. My thesis. "Obstructions to Coherence: Natural Noncoherent
Associativity and Tensor Functors", City University of New York, 1996.

The part about the associahedron was published in
Obstructions to Coherence: Noncoherent Associativity
The Journal of Pure & Applied Algebra. 147 no. 2, Pgs 175 - 213. (2000).
or http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/math.QA/9804106

The second part about the tensor functors was never published.

I look at the fundamental group of the associahedra thought of
as groupoids (called the "Catalan groupoids"). They are all trivial.
But then I ask, what if the pentagons do not commute? The fundamental group
of the Mac Lane non-commuting pentagon is Z. And I get generators and
relations for all the higher non-commuting associahedra. They are not
free groups from n=7 on.

I do a similar thing for non-coherent tensor functors (monoidal functors).

All the best,
Noson

Well, you might want to look at this:

\item  (With. M.-A. Knus), Extensions of Derivations. Proc. Amer.
      Math. Soc. {\bf 28} (1971), 313--314.

This is more homological algebra than category theory. The story is that
someone had done this in a special case (where the center was local I
think) in a dozen pages and someone else had extended it to semilocal and
Knus was lecturing at the ETH on his extension to arbitrary centers (but
the ambient ring was always semi-simple = Hochschild dimension 0).  As
Knus was lecturing I said to myself that there had to be a better way.
And there was.  It took only a paragraph and use only Hochschild dimension
1 besides.  The rest of the two pages was intro and bibliography.

Although it isn't category theory it exemplifies the categorical way of
thinking, dealing with generic properties and the like.

Incidentally, the paper was originally rejected.  The referee's report
said, "The only possible reason for publishing this is that it has been so
badly handled in the literature"!  I would have thought that an excellent
reason to publish it.  Only the fact that the editor was a personal friend
who said he would publish it if I insisted, allowed it to see the light of
day.  But I have long thought it a "proof from the book".

This is indeed a very nice statement of the ordinary Yoneda lemma, but
it doesn't seem capable of capturing all incarnations of the Yoneda
lemma, such as that in enriched category theory.

Dear Jim,

Surely that's not true, assuming that by "Mac Lane coherence" you mean Mac
Lane's coherence theorem for monoidal categories.  The associahedra (and
in particular the pentagon) say nothing about the unit coherence
isomorphisms,

X \otimes I ----> X <---- I \otimes X.

To make it true, surely you need to weaken Mac Lane's theorem to a
statement about "semigroupal" categories, i.e. monoidal categories without
unit...?

Best wishes,

Dear Category theorists,

	I'm sure the following lemma is either known, or I've made some
mistake in proving it:

Lemma:

	If I is an injective object in a topos, then for any monomorphism
I>---m--->A, the object of splittings of m, i.e.

S={f:I^A|(\forall i:I)(f(m(i))=i)}

is also injective.



Could someone let me know of a reference to it. Thanks a lot.

Toby

Quite right, I should have used something other than "lemma" for that
weaker statement.  Misplaced force of habit.

Googling "Theorem 5.1 (Yoneda)" returns section 5, on full completeness,
of Phil Scott's nice Handbook of Algebra chapter.  Phil introduces that
section with "The most basic representation theorem of all is the Yoneda
embedding: Theorem 5.1 (Yoneda) If J is locally small, the Yoneda
functor Y: J --> [J^op,Set], where Y(j) = J(-,j), is a fully faithful
embedding."

(Phil's A is my J, which I'll use throughout as the base whether small
or not in order to make it easier to compare theorems.)

If "theorem" is good enough for Phil it's good enough for me.  For
definiteness let's name the theorems as follows.

YT (Yoneda Theorem): [J^op,Set] fully extends J.

YL (Yoneda Lemma): For any functor F: J^op --> Set and object j of J,
F(j) is in bijection with [J^op,Set](J(-,j),F).  (This replaces C in
Steve's version with J^op.)

DYT (Dense Yoneda Theorem):  C is equivalent to a category of presheaves
on a *small* category J if and only if C densely extends J.

Here a category of presheaves on J means a full subcategory of
[J^op,Set] containing the functors J(-,j) for all objects j of J (that
is, "on J" qualifies not just the individual presheaves but the whole
category of them, as in "free group on X"(*)).  C densely extends J just
when there exists a full, faithful, and dense functor K: J --> C.  (If
someone has a use for a broader notion of dense extension I wouldn't
object to saying "fully densely extends.")

For now assume "dense" is defined as in X.6 of CWM, namely that every
object of C arises as a colimit of FP for the evident functor P: (K,c)
--> J, (K,c) being the comma category whose morphisms are of the form
Kj-->c, j in ob(J).  (I'll consider equivalent ways of defining density
in a followup message.)  This has the effect of representing each object
c of C as the presheaf C(K-,c): J^op --> Set (namely C(Kj,c) is the set
of morphisms of (K,c) of the form Kj-->c) and each homset C(c,d) as
[J^op,Set](C(K-,c),C(K-,d)) (that is, Nat(C(K-,c),C(K-,d)) in the CWM
notation Steve is using), via the adjunction defining "colimit."

The homsets [J^op,Set](J(-,j),F) used by YL (and hence YT) are always
small even if J isn't.  DYT however deals with arbitrary homsets
[J^op,Set](F,G), which may be large when J is, whence DYT's requirement
that J be small.  (Steve Lack would be the person to ask what form DYT
might take for large J.)

The applicability of YL and YT to large J makes them incomparable with
DYT.  However if we require J to be small then we have YT < YL < DYT in
the sense that each of them represents entities by using progressively
more of [J^op,Set].  YT uses just the image of the Yoneda embedding to
represent J, YL takes one step beyond YT by using all the homsets from
that image to an arbitrary presheaf in [J^op,Set] to represent carriers
of algebras with unary operations (aka presheaves), and DYT takes one
more step than YL by using homsets between more general presheaves of
[J^op,Set] to represent *all* homsets of C.

Replacing "equivalent to" by "representable as" in DYT makes more
explicit the sense in which DYT is unambiguously a representation
theorem for certain abstractly defined categories, namely dense
extensions of a small category, which are of greater generality than the
categories contemplated in YT or YL.

I would only buy that reasoning for small J (otherwise why should G^F be
a functor to Set?), where YL isn't benefiting from the additional
generality of YL over DYT.  Is there any other reason to prefer YL to
DYT?  It doesn't seem a very natural candidate for theorem-hood (perhaps
that's why it's relegated to the status of a lemma).  It's hard to argue
for it as the fundamental theorem of CT when it's sandwiched in between
YT and DYT, both of which *do* come across as real theorems (the reason
I'm comfortable calling both of them theorems).  Anyone remember the
history of why YL rose to the top?

Don't underestimate the power of the converse.  YL < DYT because it's
only a partial converse, DYT is the whole thing.

The colimit-based definition of dense functor shows that this is pretty
much equivalent to DYT and therefore stronger than YL in what I take to
be the sense in which you consider YL stronger than YT. (Is there a
stronger sense of "stronger," e.g. a natural nonstandard model in which
YT is true and YL false, or YL true and DYT false?)

Michael Shulman's comment about the enriched case is apropos here:
defining cocompletion for conical (co)limits isn't sufficient when V
doesn't permit them (for want of diagonal functors).  This limitation
can be avoided with left Kan extensions as treated in Chapter 4 of
Kelly, "Basic Concepts of Enriched Category Theory."  Kelly arrives at
the notion of free cocompletion 15 pages into Chapter 4 and long after
indexed (nowadays weighted) colimits (Chapter 3) as a satisfactory
generalization of conical colimits.

(Incidentally, of what use are non-free cocompletions?  Is there any
reason not to define "cocompletion" to make it free?  I seem to recall
people being happy to drop "free" in this context.  Who ordered "free"?)

This post is quite long enough already so I'll stop it here with the
interesting question (to me anyway), what is the earliest point in the
development of (ordinary or unenriched) category theory at which one can
introduce either cocompletion or density in order to have functors that
are dense, full, and faithful?  Can either be usefully introduced before
functor categories, for example?  And can this be done with sufficient
generality to carry over essentially unchanged to the enriched case?  I
imagine this would reduce to just avoiding conical colimits.

The proof of Proposition 2.7.1 on page 59 in Volume I of "Handbook of =
Categorical Algebra" by Francis Borceux may be a candidate.  John Gray =
once told me that the proof is due to Peter Freyd.  When I was studying =
category theory in graduate school, proofs of this proposition, the =
Adjoint Functor Theorem, and some other results in "Categories, =
Allegories" struck me as demonstrating a creative, original, and =
insightful use of limits and colimits.

Recently rereading Fourman's "Continuous Truth" I came across the term
"separable locale" but could nowhere find an explanation. Does it mean a
cHa A for which there exists a countable subset B such that ever a in A is
the supremum of those b in B with b leq a. This would be the point free
account of "second countable", i.e. having a countable basis.
Of course, second countable T_) spaces are separable, i.e. have a
countable
dense set.
Is this reading the "usual" one?
