ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

For the FACETS OF REALIZABILITY workshop.

https://project.inria.fr/realizability2019

Cachan (Paris), France, 1 - 3 July 2019.

We are looking for people who want to present recent work on topics
related to realizability.

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission deadline: 1st June
Workshop: 1st-3rd July

BACKGROUND:

The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in
realizability or whose research involves applications of realizability.
Here, ???realizability??? is to be understood in a very broad sense to
foster new ideas from interaction of people working on its different
aspects. The main focus will be realizability interpretations,
arithmetic, function and categorical realizability and in particular
work on the boundary between any of these. An example of a concept that
lies at the border between arithmetic and function realizability is the
principle of bar induction.

INVITED SPEAKER:

Paulo Oliva

TOPICS:

The scope of the workshop includes but is not limited to:
- Number realizability
- Modified realizability
- Function realizability
- Computable analysis
- Dialectica interpretation
- Classical realizability
- Synthetic topology
- Categorical realizability
- Bar induction / bar recursion

Short abstracts (at most half a page excluding references) should be
sent to the two organizers directly with subject line ???[facets of
realizability] abstract???. There will be no formal reviewing but the
organizers will select work they consider relevant to the workshop and
give notification of accepted abstracts as they arrive. The abstracts
will not be published and contributions about submitted or already
published work are welcome.

the organizers, Valentin Blot & Florian Steinberg
