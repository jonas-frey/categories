Below is the solicitation for the 2011 WCATSS. This is a small-scale 
WCATSS, and it will be more like an informal conference, by and for 
postdocs and grad students at all levels who are interested in algebraic 
topology. Please consider giving a talk--it's great for your CV, and this 
is a relaxed environment for inexperienced speakers.

It's best to sign up by July 8, especially if you would like to be 
considered for funding.

2011 West Coast Algebraic Topology Summer School
University of Washington, Seattle
Dates: August 26 - 28

Hello. This year we're having a small-scale WCATSS, organized by and for 
grad students and postdocs. The content of the course will be based on the 
interests and expertise of the participants. Current topics include:

Stable homotopy theory
Model categories and their localization
Ring spectra
Triangulated categories

Participants will have the opportunity to do some subset of the following:

1. give a talk about their research or a topic of interest.
2. collaborate with other grad students in planning topics and pre-lectures.
3. attend lectures outlining current research, as well as more general background pre-lectures, and extended question/answer sessions.

All interested graduate students and postdocs are encouraged to visit 
http://2011-wcatss.wikispaces.com/ for more information. Limited travel 
funding is available.

Or contact wcatss2011@gmail.com if you have questions.
