If everything can be related to interval arithmetic in one way or
another, why not take interval arithmetic itself as the gold standard
for the constructive reals?  The Edalat-Escardo-Potter domain-theoretic
analysis of interval arithmetic struck me as sufficiently canonical that
I don't understand why all the alternatives aren't being evaluated
relative to that one.  Are there alternatives that compensate for some
shortcoming of interval arithmetic as understood through the lens of
domain theory?
