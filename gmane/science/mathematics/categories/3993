yes, that is an interesting question. in fact, i have a similar question
about the words star and dagger. although they are perfectly acceptable
english words on their own, in the context of categories we write
*-autonomous and %-compact, even in the titles, where star-autonomous and
dagger-compact would say the same, just look easier to pronounce.

but then again, with my name and surname gaining and losing accents as i
go, maybe i should not ask such questions.
