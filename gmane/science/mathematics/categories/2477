After giving the matter some thought, I finally decided that the
category of Hilbert spaces should have as its morphisms norm-reducing
linear maps.  At the very least that will ensure that an isomorphism is
an isometry.  And yes the category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces
is *-autonomous.  The internal hom of two is the space of all linear
maps and the inner product <f,g> = \sum f(u_i)g(u_i), taken over an
orthonormal basis of the domain.  This can be shown to be invariant
under orthogonal change of  basis.  The norm of the identity on an
n-dimensional space is sqrt(n).  The dual of a space is itself, of
course with the duality being adjunction (or transpose).  Then the
tensor product H # G = (H --o G^*)^*.

Here is another approach to the same structure.  Consider a pair
(V,\phi) where V is a finite dimensional space and \phi is an
isomorphism of V with its dual space.  You have to add positive
definiteness and symmetry, but that is no problem.  Maps again are norm
reducing.  Now we can define (V,\phi) # (W,\psi) = (V # W,\phi # \psi),
(V,\phi)^* = (V,\phi^{-1}), and (V,\phi) --o (W,\psi) = (V # W,\phi^{-1}
# \psi).  The resultant category is exactly the same as before.

BTW, it is easy to see that the transpose of a norm-reducing map is norm
reducing.
