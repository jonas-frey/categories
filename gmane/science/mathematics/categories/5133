Dear Pierre,

at ESSLLI'09 at Bordeaux it was said quite a lot about
categorical linguistics. I would suggest to have a look
at the site, you may also look for such names as Sylvain Salvati,
Philippe de Groote, Gerald Penn, and keywords abstract categorical gramma=
rs,
parsing with categorical grammars... By the way,
Sylvain told me that now there are uses for coherence
theorems from category theory in parsing.

Best regards,

Sergei Soloviev
