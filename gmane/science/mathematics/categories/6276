I personally prefer to say that "unique choice structure" is something
"in between" property and structure.  Kelly and Lack dubbed it
"Property-like structure" in their paper with that title.  The
difference is exactly as you say: property-like structure is unique
(up to unique isomorphism) when it exists, but is not necessarily
"preserved" by all morphisms.  In terms of forgetful functors,
property-like structure corresponds to a functor which is
*pseudomonic*, i.e. faithful, and full-on-isomorphisms.  Another nice
example is that being a monoid is a "property" of a semigroup, i.e. a
semigroup can have at most one identity element, but a semigroup
homomorphism between monoids need not be a monoid homomorphism.
