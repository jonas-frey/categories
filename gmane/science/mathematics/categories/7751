This brings up one of my hobby-horses, that the virtues of abstraction
are not marketed, even to mathematics students.  After I gave a
presentation to teachers and pupils on knots, including prime knots, in
1987 or so a teacher came up to me and said: "That is the first time in
my mathematical career that anyone has used the term `analogy' in
relation to mathematics!" Who is responsible for this?

Of course *abstraction* is about *analogies*.  I will comment  this on
the given web site, but my registration awaits approval. The word
`analogy' does occur 9 times in Spivak's book, but not I think with this
force.

Tim and I have a paper:

   `Category Theory: an abstract setting for
analogy and comparison', In: What is Category Theory? Advanced
Studies in Mathematics and Logic, Polimetrica Publisher, Italy,
(2006) 257-274.  ([141] on my publication list. pdf available)

The other side to category theory is that is has stimulated the
development of new algebraic/mathematical  structures.
