Vaughan's message prompts me to pass on the information, received
today, that the U.S. end of OUP has already sold out of copies of
(at least) the second volume of the "Elephant", due to higher than
expected sales. The U.K. end still has some copies, but they are just
about to reprint, six months before they expected to do so. What
implication (if any) this has for the availability of the book from
Amazon, I have no idea.
