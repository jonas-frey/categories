======================================================
               Lecturer position in PPS
          (University Paris 7 Denis Diderot)
======================================================

A lecturer position will be opened next academic year
within the Laboratory PPS (Preuves Programmes Systemes)
located at University Paris 7 Denis Diderot:
http://www.pps.jussieu.fr

Important dates:
- deadline for qualification A:      28 October 2009
- deadline for qualification B:      14 December 2009
- deadline for application as indicated on the web page
http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/annonces/200909-mdc
- starting date:                     September 2010

Application procedure.
The applicant should have defended his/her PhD thesis
before Thursday 10 December 2009.

The procedure works in two stages in France: in the first stage,
every candidate applies to a national committee in order to be qualified.

* Qualification step A.
The first step of qualification is performed at the following web site:
https://galaxie.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/antares/can/index.jsp
Note that this first step should be done very soon, before 28 October.
The interested candidates should not be afraid to contact us
sufficiently early in case of difficulty with the qualification procedure.

* Qualification step B.
Once the application has been performed on the web site,
the names of two reviewers are notified on Monday 16 November
on the ANTARES web site:
https://galaxie.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/antares/can/index.jsp
The candidate should then immediately send his full application
to the two reviewers, and at last before Monday 14 December 2010.

* Application step.
In this second stage, the qualified candidate should send
his full application to the University Paris Denis Diderot,
this including a resume, a research project and referee letters.
All necessary information about that step will appear
on the web site in due time.

Profile of the position.
Foundations of programming languages, possibly with connections
to concurrency theory, with an expertise in one or several of
the fields below:

Logic:
-- lambda-calculus and extensions, in particular to classical logic,
-- linear logic and non-deterministic generalizations,
either probabilistic or algebraic (in particular differential)
-- formal certification and program extraction.

Computer Science:
-- operational semantics of the lambda-calculus and of its extensions
(rewriting, abstract machines)
-- denotational semantics (domains and other models)
-- theoretical foundations of new programming paradigms
(in particular web programming)

Algebra:
-- categorical description of calculus
(monoidal categories, higher-dimensional categories,
homological and homotopical invariants)
-- homotopy theory and concurrency.

The selected candidate will work within the laboratory PPS
(Preuves, Programmes, Systemes)
      http://www.pps.jussieu.fr
The general purpose of the PPS lab is to study the syntactic,
semantic and algebraic aspects of proof theory and programming
languages. The lab is internationally recognized as one of
the leading research laboratories in mathematics and computer science,
with its distinctive proof-theoretic culture.

The laboratory PPS is located in Chevaleret, the largest research
community of mathematicians in France. The laboratory PPS
is also part of the Fondation Sciences Mathematiques de Paris.
