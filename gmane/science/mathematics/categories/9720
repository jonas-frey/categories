Harold Simmons was around at most of the PSSLs I started to attend in
the second half of the 80s. As a middle European person I was deeply
impressed by his sense of humour and having a sarcastic attitude to
everything without being cynical.
Only later I learned that he set some trends like provability logic or
locale theory well before my time. One would have heard this from him
directly. I think he was a paradigm in not following fashions and
sticking to his interests. How different from what is predominant nowadays.

It's sad that one can't meet him again (and go for a `snifter' as he
would have put it).
