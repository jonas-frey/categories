     OXFORD UNIVERSITY COMPUTING LABORATORY 
         IN COLLABORATION WITH MICROSOFT

      	       RESEARCH OFFICER

        INTENTIONAL PROGRAMMING PROJECT

Oxford University Computing Laboratory has recently started
a three-year research project in collaboration with
Microsoft Research Laboratories.  The goal is to develop a
new kind of environment for transformational programming
that permits software to be composed from a set of
independent design decisions or "intentions", using
domain-specific notations and optimization strategies. The
specific aim of the Oxford component of the work is to
design a meta-language for the environment, within which
domain-specific abstractions can be described, implemented
and reused.

We now have a vacancy for an additional research officer to
join the project with immediate effect, for an initial
period of one year, but with the expectation of an
extension to cover the three-year life of the project,
depending on continuation of the research contract.

The research officer will work at Oxford University
Computing Laboratory, together with three research students
and three academics, namely Oege de Moor, Michael Spivey and
Bernard Sufrin. The research officer's specific tasks will
include:

(a) identifying suitable features of current meta languages
in compiler construction and automated theorem proving.

(b) designing and building a prototype implementation of a
suitable meta language.

(c) experimenting with the use of that meta language in
case studies.  

The successful candidate will

* have demonstrated research ability in a Computing-related
discipline,

* have experience of programming language design and
implementation, transformational programming, or automated
theorem proving,

* actively enjoy the challenge of collaborating with
engineers working in industry.  

Familiarity with formal methods of program construction 
will be an advantage.

Salary will be on the age and experience related RS1A grade
(currently 15,735 to 23,651 p.a.).  Applications should
clearly state the post title and be in the form of a full
curriculum vitae plus application letter, together with the
names of two referees. Further details and selection
criteria are available from
http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/jobs.html 
or on request to The Administrator of the Computing Laboratory.

The completed application should be sent to arrive before
the closing date of Friday 6th November 1998 and be
addressed to: The Administrator, Oxford University
Computing Laboratory, Wolfson Building, Parks Road, Oxford
OX1 3QD.  (Email: Mike.Field@comlab.ox.ac.uk) .  Oxford
University is an Equal Opportunities Employer

Informal email enquiries about the academic aspects of
this project and this post are welcome, and should be 
directed to one of the academics: 
        oege@comlab.ox.ac.uk   (Oege de Moor) 
        mike@comlab.ox.ac.uk   (Michael Spivey)
        sufrin@comlab.ox.ac.uk (Bernard Sufrin)

Oxford University Computing Laboratory is a full academic
department of the University and at present has
twenty-seven academic staff, thirty-five research officers
and approximately sixty doctoral students, engaged in
teaching and carrying out research in computer science and
numerical analysis.
