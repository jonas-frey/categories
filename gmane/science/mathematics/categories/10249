Dear friends and colleagues,

This is a reminder that the GeoCat workshop will start online tomorrow =
and take place on Sunday 5 and Monday 6 July.

The purpose of the GeoCat workshop is to provide an open and =
interdisciplinary venue where mathematicians, logicians and computer =
scientists interested in category theory, algebraic topology and higher =
structures can freely meet and interact. The ambition of the workshop is =
to establish and nourish a fruitful dialogue between the foundational =
and categorical aspects of topology and geometry on the one hand, and of =
computation and deduction on the other hand.

We are very happy with the scientific program of the workshop, which =
will offer us the opportunity to listen to eight invited speakers:

Denis-Charles Cisinski (Universit=C3=A4t Regensburg)
Andrea Gagna (Charles University)
Amar Hadzihasanovic (Universit=C3=A9 de Paris)
Yuki Maehara (Macquarie University)
Philippe Malbos (Universit=C3=A9 Claude Bernard)
Simona Paoli (University of Leicester)
Sophie Raynor (Macquarie University)
Martina Rovelli (Australian National University)

The workshop is free and online and you are thus all welcome to join and =
take an active part to it. You will find more on the event here:
https://www.irif.fr/~geocat

Note that in order to have access to the talks, you will first need to =
register here:
https://fscd2020.org/register-ws

Many thanks, we are looking forward to meeting you online very soon!

Christine and Paul-Andr=C3=A9

ps: please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any difficulty to =
register and access the workshop online.
