Hi David

Since i could not e-mail you directly=2C i got delivery failure=2C i send m=

I have developed many perspectives on categories
=20
As the study of algebraic structures with several objects
As the study of primitive mathematical universe or space (not as fancy as a=
 topos)
As an unifying tool in mathematics
As a foundation of mathematics (that is structural)
As an abstarction of an abstarction of an abstarction of ... (if you go to =
higher categories)
As a generalized theory of representations=20


If i have missed someone please let me know.

I don't think i understand in what style Ehresmann worked in.

Should it not be weak oo-groupoids?
I think you also mean homotopy category of spaces instead of
"homotopy theory of spaces andthe related".
Spaces is a bit vague but i encounter this sometimes in category theory.
Usually in such statements it is ment a topological space.

Is there a categorical definition of a space (not a topological space)?

I have seen similar problems and maby this one also.
John Baez mentioned a bunch of such problems on an internet page
and Ronnie Brown also in explaining pursuing stacks.


Thank you for the problems.
