The purpose of the workshop is to consider the notion of internal act=
ion in
different categorical contexts and to relate it with internal structu=
res
defined thereby.

In particular, the well established context of semiabelian categories=
 provides a
natural setting for studying  the interplay between categorical and a=
lgebraic
aspects of actions, with respect to internal structures that may be d=
efined.
Nevertheless, more general  settings are worth to be considered ( lex=
 pointed
categories with sums, protomodular categories...)

Keywords of the meeting are: the representability of actions, suffici=
ent
conditions for their existence,  universal actions, categorical semi-=
direct
product and constructions, internal groupoids and internal crossed mo=
dules,
internal commutator theory, cohomological implications.


The workshop is intended to reflect its etymology, in order to give t=
he
participants a fruitful opportunity of debate and exchange experience=
s about
the subject.
That is the reason why after every lecture there will be time for inf=
ormal
discussions.

The backbone of the meeting are the lectures of the invited speakers:=
 Dominique
Bourn (Universit=E9 du Littoral), Marino Gran (Universit=E9 du Littor=
al) and Enrico
Vitale (Universit=E9 Catholique LLN).  Lectures are scheduled on Thur=
sday 26th
and Friday 27th (morning and afternoon), and on Saturday 28th (only m=
orning).

Attendance is open to everyone and other contributions on related top=
ics will be
considered with pleasure.

The workshop will take place at the Math Department of Universit=E0 d=
egli Studi,
Milan, Italy.
Detailed program, logistic and further information will follow.
