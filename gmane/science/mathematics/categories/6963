Dold gave two courses in algebraic topology while I was a graduate =
student
at Columbia, 1961-62 I think. They were really beautiful. Apart from =
Sammy's course
on homological algebra, they were the only lectures I learned something =
from, I still
have the notes. Albrecht Dold was a wonderful mathematician, and a very =
decent person.
I think we will all miss him.

I have meet Dold only a couple of times.
He always made a big impression on me.

I remember very well his talk at the conference in honour of Samy =
Eilenberg in 1984.
He spoke on a categorical formulation of Lefschetz fixed points theorem =
using S-duality and trace.
It was a very beautiful mixture of category theory and topology.=20
He received a standing ovation for his talk!

He is one of my mathematical heros.
