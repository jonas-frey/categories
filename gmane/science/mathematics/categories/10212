Workshop on Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations

July 5-6, 2020, The Internet

https://hott-uf.github.io/2020

     Abstract submission deadline: May 20, 2020

Homotopy Type Theory is a young area of logic, combining ideas from
several established fields: the use of dependent type theory as a
foundation for mathematics, inspired by ideas and tools from abstract
homotopy theory. Univalent Foundations are foundations of mathematics
based on the homotopical interpretation of type theory.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested
in all aspects of Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations: from
the study of syntax and semantics of type theory to practical
formalization in proof assistants based on univalent type theory.

# Invited talks

* Carlo Angiuli (Carnegie Mellon University)
* Liron Cohen (Ben-Gurion University)
* Pierre-Louis Curien (Universit=C3=A9 de Paris)

# Submissions

* Abstract submission deadline: May 20, 2020
* Author notification: June 05, 2020

Submissions should consist of a title and an abstract, in pdf format,
of no more than 2 pages, submitted via
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dhottuf2020

Considering the broad background of the expected audience, we encourage
authors to include information of pedagogical value in their abstract,
such as motivation and context of their work.
