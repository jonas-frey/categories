IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (LICS 2008)
      Call for Workshop Proposals
      24th=E2=80=9327th June 2008,
      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA
* The Twenty-Third IEEE Symposium on Logic In Computer Science (LICS 2008)
  (see http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/lics/lics08 ) will be held
  in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (USA) June 24--27, 2008.  It will be
  colocated with CSF (IEEE Computer Security Foundations).
* Possible dates for workshops are June 21-23
  (i.e. up to three days before LICS).
* Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for
  workshops on topics relating logic - broadly construed - to computer
  science or related fields. Typically, LICS workshops feature a
  number of invited speakers and a smaller number of contributed
  presentations. LICS workshops do not produce formal proceedings.
  However, in the past there have been special issues of journals
  based in part on certain LICS workshops.
* Proposals should include:
  - A short scientific summary and justification of the proposed topic.
    This should include a discussion of the particular benefits of the
    topic to the LICS community.
  - A discussion of the proposed format and agenda.
  - The proposed duration, which is typically one to two days,
    and your preferred dates.  (important!)
  - Let us know if you would like your workshop to be a joint
    workshop with CSF.
  - Procedures for selecting participants and papers.
  - Expected number of participants (this is important!)
  - Potential invited speakers.
  - Plans for dissemination (for example, special issues of journals).
* Proposals are due Nov. 20, 2007 and should be submitted
  electronically to both of us:

   Adriana Compagnoni
   abc@cs.stevens.edu

   Philip Scott
   phil@site.uottawa.ca

   Workshops Chairs,
   LICS 2008
* Please specify if you wish to have a 1 or 2 day workshop. And your
  preferred dates.
* Workshops will be chosen by a committee consisting of the LICS
  General Chair, LICS Workshop Chairs, LICS 2008 PC Chair and LICS
  2008 Conference Chair.



5th WORKSHOP ON "METHODS FOR MODALITIES" (M4M-5)
   November 29-30, 2007, Cachan, France
   http://m4m.loria.fr/M4M5
* The workshop ``Methods for Modalities'' (M4M) aims to bring together
  researchers interested in developing algorithms, verification methods
  and tools based on modal logics. Here the term ``modal logics'' is
  conceived broadly, including temporal logic, description logic,
  guarded fragments, conditional logic, temporal and hybrid logic, etc.
  To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will feature a
  number of invited talks by leading scientists, research presentations
  aimed at highlighting new developments, and submissions of
  system demonstrations.
  We strongly encourage young researchers and students to submit papers
  and posters, especially for experimental and prototypical software tools
  which are related to modal logics.
* Invited speakers:
  Ahmed Bouajjani (University of Paris 7),
  Patricia Bouyer (OUCL, Oxford - LSV, ENS Cachan),
  Balder ten Cate (University of Amsterdam),
  Koen Claessen (Chalmers University of Technology),
  Wiebe van der Hoek (University of Liverpool)
* Important dates:
  Deadline for submissions: September 7th, 2007
  Notification: October 10, 2007
  Camera ready versions: November 5, 2007
  Workshop dates: November 29-30, 2007
* Paper Submissions: Authors are invited to submit papers in the
  following three categories.
  - Regular papers up to 15 pages, describing original results,
    work in progress, or future directions of research.
  - System descriptions of up to 12 pages, describing new systems or
    significant upgrades of existing ones.
  - Presentation-only papers, describing work recently published
    or submitted (no page limit).  These will not be included in the
    proceedings, but pre-prints or post-prints can be made available to
    participants.
* Final versions of accepted papers will be published online
  in an Elsevier ENTCS volume. A preliminary version of the proceedings
  will also be available at the workshop.

    workshop.
  - Preference for a pre- or post-conference workshop, if any.  (Note,
    however, that the final choice of the day when the workshop will be
    held and other logistic aspects will be decided by the organizing
    committee.)
  - A short scientific summary of the topic, including a discussion on
    the relation with the ICALP topics.
  - A description of past versions of the workshop, if any, including
    dates, organisers, submission and acceptance counts, attendance.

11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THEORY AND APPLICATIONS OF
   SATISFIABILITY TESTING (SAT 2008)
   Call for Papers
   May 12 - 15, 2008
   Guangzhou, P. R. China
   http://www.upb.de/cs/SAT08
* The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
  Satisfiability Testing is the primary annual meeting for
  researchers studying the propositional satisfiability problem
  (SAT). SA5DT08 is the eleventh SAT conference. SAT08 features the
   SAT Race, the Max-SAT Evaluation, and the QBFEVAL.
* SCOPE
  Many hard combinatorial problems can be encoded into SAT.
  Therefore improvements on heuristics on the practical side, as well
  as theoretical insights into SAT apply to a large range of real-world
  problems. More specifically, many important practical verification
  problems can be rephrased as SAT problems. This applies to
  verification problems in hardware and software. Thus SAT is becoming
  one of the most important core technologies to verify secure and
  dependable systems. The topics of the conference span practical and
  theoretical research on SAT and its applications and include but are
  not limited to proof systems, proof complexity, search algorithms,
  heuristics, analysis of algorithms, hard instances, randomized
  formulae, problem encodings, industrial applications, solvers,
  simplifiers, tools, case studies and empirical results. SAT is
  interpreted in a rather broad sense: besides propositional
  satisfiability, it includes the domain of quantified boolean
  formulae (QBF), constraints programming techniques (CSP) for
  word-level problems and their propositional encoding and
  particularly satisfiability modulo theories (SMT).
* SUBMISSION
  Submissions should contain original material and can either be
  regular research papers up to 14 pages or short papers up to 6
  pages. Double submissions including submissions as short and long
  papers will be rejected.  Submissions should use the Springer
  LNCS style. All appendices, tables, figures and the bibliography
  must fit into the page limit. Submissions deviating from these
  requirements may be rejected without review.
  All accepted papers including short papers will be published
  in the proceedings of the conference. The conference proceedings
  will be published within Springer LNCS series. The submission page is
  http://www.easychair.org/SAT2008. Papers have to be submitted
  electronically as PDF files.
* IMPORTANT DATES
  January 11, 2008  Abstract Submission
  January 18, 2008  Paper Submission
  February 18, 2008 Author Notification
  February 25, 2008 Final Version
* PROGRAM CHAIRS
  Hans Kleine B=C3=BCning, University of Paderborn, Germany
  Xishun Zhao, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, P.R. China
* Further information on SAT Race, Max-SAT Evaluation, and QBFEVAL
  will be published also on the SAT08 conference web page.
