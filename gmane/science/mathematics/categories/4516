"aboutissement" existed for over 50 years of course, but the translation
"abutment" is, (at least in the references given in these postings, including
the translation of the grothendieck-serre correspondence) much more recent, it
seem that all of its occurrences are from the second millennium, or very close.

On the other hand, we have learned in these postings that in the 1980's and
before, the word "limit" (and not "abutment') was used for what a spectral
sequence converges to. An authority as Peter Hilton used "limit".

There are a lot of well established words in mathematics which are not
particularly meaningful, but the difference with  "abutment" is precisely that
they are well established.
