Thanks.  I don't have access to that book at the moment, but I seem to
remember that they don't mention triposes.  Do you know if anyone has
studied realizability triposes by looking at their associated
allegories/bicategories of relations, and/or compared (in that context or
another) the category-of-pers construction of realizability toposes with
the exact-completion method?
