From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

I regret that my recent posting on Pratt's construction should not
have been sent to categories.  He sent me privately a construction
showing that A -o A has at least 2^K dinatural endomorphisms (that
is the diagonalization of the functor that takes A,B to A -o B) in
chu(Set,K) and I mistakenly thought it had come off the categories
bulletin board.  But it had been sent to me privately.  In any case, 
the claim is correct and my description for K = 2 is too.

Sorry for the mixup.

Michael
