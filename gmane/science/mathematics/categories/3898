Dear Colleagues,

The artificial choice of unit of length=20
should indeed be avoided in fundamental
considerations since, among other things,
it trivializes the relation between length &
area, etc.

Over a given rig R, a Euclidean space E seems
to be
1) a torsor over an R-module V where V
is equipped with=20
2) an isomorphism=20
         V->Hom(V, L)
3) where L is an invertible R-module.

The fact  that L itself has no given rig structure
can be compared with the general idea of
metric (TAC Reprints 1) as valued in a monoidal
category (which has one covariant binary operation,
NOT two.)

The R-modules R, L, L@L, etc, may be=20
non-isomorphic, and there may even be=20
other invertibles corresponding to time, force, etc.
However, this Picard group will have all its elements
of order two (i.e.,each invertible module will have
its own R-valued pairing) if R is real in the sense
that a sum of several squares is invertible if one of them=20
is (as shown a few years ago by Steve Schanuel).
That result is for the category of abstract sets,
destroying my hope that the free abelian group on
three generators might occur for a suitable spatial
topos of affine algebraic geometry.

Of course, a unit of M, where M is an invertible=20
module, should be an isomorphism R->M, but=20
in general such isomorphisms exist only locally.

To see nontrivial invertible modules, look at
classical arithmetic or complex analysis, or in
the present geometric vein, look at rigs and R-modules
not in abstract sets, but in more cohesive or variable
toposes. Garrett Birkhoff recommended the topos of
G-sets for a certain group G of homogeneities,=20
obtaining (in a rather tautological way) the result=20
that the group of dimensional analysis occurs as a=20
Picard group.

Looking forward to your thoughts
Bill
