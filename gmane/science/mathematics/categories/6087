Classical Logic and Set Theory influenced deeply the emergence of =20
Analytical Philosophy at the
beginning of XXth Century. After a hundred years, it may be time that =20=

the Logic of Sheaves and
Category Theory help to create alternative forms of practicing =20
Philosophy.
Closer to the concepts of movement, flow, passage, boundary and =20
contamination, Sheaf Logic
and Category Theory must reinvigorate some regions of Philosophy =20
abandoned by the
Analytical dogmae. =93Naturalized=94 Phenomenology, =93Mathematical=94 =20=

Metaphysics, =93Semiotical=94
Hermeneutics, between others, may thus emerge with new instruments at =20=

hand.
The Symposium Philosophy of the Logic of Sheaves hopes to establish =20
the state of the question,
profiting from a creator of the Logic of Sheaves (Caicedo) and some =20
major specialists in the
Philosophy and History of Category Theory (Kr=F6mer, Marquis, McLarty). =20=

Forty years after
Grothendieck=92s departure from the IHES, the Symposium will be devoted =20=

in part to his legacy.

Speakers:

- Colin McLarty (Case Western Reserve University)

- Xavier Caicedo (U. de los Andes, Colombia)

- Jean Pierre Marquis (Universit=E9 de Montr=E9al)

- Ralf Kromer (Nancy Universit=E9 / University of Siegen)

-Fernando Zalamea (U. Nacional, Colombia)
