Fred Linton has pointed out to me that my terminology here is not
standard. By "isometric injector", I mean a morphism which is unitary
on its range, i.e., one-to-one and norm-preserving in the case of
Hilbert spaces; I believe this is usually simply referred to as an
isometry. By "isometric projector", I mean a morphism which is unitary
on the complement of its kernel; some people prefer to call this a
"partial isometry". I was then using the terms "isometric" and
"isometry" to mean "isometric projector or isometric injector".

    Anyway, the simple prescription I give for a bilimit cannot work,
as it is easy to find diagrams in the category of finite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces, our canonical example of a strongly compact-closed
category with biproducts, for which the colimit and limit are not
isomorphic. A diagram f:A-->B for non-iso A and B is the simplest
example. However, if we restrict to diagrams F:D-->FdHilb such that D
admits a dagger-operation compatible with the dagger on FdHilb, then I
believe the conjecture becomes plausible.
