                               Call for Papers

                        12th International Workshop on
                 Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science (CMCS'14)
                     5 - 6 April 2014, Grenoble, France
                         http://www.coalg.org/cmcs14


NEW DEADLINE: 15 January 2014!

Objectives and scope
-------------------
Established in 1998, the CMCS workshops aim to bring together researchers
with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras, their logics, and their
applications. As the workshop series strives to maintain breadth in its
scope,
areas of interest include neighbouring fields as well. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to, the following:
- The theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
    approaches)
- Coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for
    programming languages, dynamical systems, term rewriting, etc.)
- Coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent, and constraint)
    programming
- Model checking, theorem proving and deductive verification
    using coalgebraic techniques
- Coalgebraic data types, type systems and
    behavioural typing
- Proof principles and (coinductive) definitions for
    coalgebras (e.g. with bisimulations or invariants)
- Coalgebras and algebras
- Coalgebraic specification and verification
- Coalgebras and (modal) logic
- Coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event
    and hybrid systems)
- Coalgebra in quantum computing
-  Coalgebra and game theory
- Tools exploiting colgebraic techniques

Venue and event
---------------
CMCS'14 will be held in Grenoble, France, co-located with ETAPS 2014 on

Submission guidelines
---------------------
We solicit two types of contributions: regular papers and short
contributions.
Regular papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for
publication elsewhere. They should not exceed 20 pages in length in
Springer
LNCS style. Short contributions may describe work in progress, or summarise
work submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere. They should be no
more
than two pages. Regular papers and short contributions should be submitted
electronically as a PDF file via the Easychair system at

          http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcs2014.

The proceedings of CMCS 2014 will include all accepted regular papers and
will be published post-conference as a Springer volume in the IFIP-LNCS
series. Accepted short contributions will be bundled in a technical report.
