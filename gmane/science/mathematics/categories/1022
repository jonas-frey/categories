what does "no coherence assumptions at all" mean in this context?
does it mean that yanofsky is studying what i call "coarse
n-categories", defined recursively as categories enriched over the
cartesian closed category where the objects are the coarse
[n-1]-categories and the morphisms are the enriched natural
isomorphism classes of enriched functors?  coarse n-categories are
interesting but they're obviously not the whole story; for example
it's straightforward to define the "fundamental coarse n-groupoid" of
a space, but it's indeed a rather coarse invariant of the homotopy
type.
