Second Call for Papers
------------------------
4th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2008)
Leicester, United Kingdom,
September 7 - 13, 2008
-----------------------
The 4th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2008)
will be held in Leicester (United Kingdom) in the second week of
September 2008,  along with several satellite events. It continues the
line of conferences previously held in Barcelona (Spain) in 2002, Rome
(Italy) in 2004, and Natal  (Brazil) in 2006 as well as a series of six
International Workshops on Graph Transformation with Applications in
Computer Science between 1978 and 1998, and alternates with the workshop
series on Application of Graph Transformation with Industrial Relevance.
The conference takes place under the auspices of EATCS, EASST, and IFIP
WG 1.3. Awards will be given by EATCS and EASST for the best theoretical
and application-oriented papers. Proceedings are planned with Springer's
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

Scope:

Graphs are among the simplest and most universal models for a variety of
systems, not just in computer science, but throughout engineering and
the life sciences. When systems evolve we are interested in the way they
change, to predict, support, or react to their evolution. Graph
transformation combines the idea of graphs as a universal modelling
paradigm with a rule-based approach to specify evolution. The area is
concerned with both the theory of graph transformation and their
application to a variety of domains.

The conference aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners
interested in the foundations and application of graph transformation to
a variety of areas. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to

    * foundations and theory of
          o General models of graph transformatio
          o High-level and adhesive replacement systems
          o Node-, edge-, and hyperedge replacement grammars
          o Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformations
          o Term graph rewriting
          o Hierarchical graphs and decompositions of graphs
          o Logic expression of graph transformation properties
          o Graph theoretical properties of graph languages
          o Geometrical and topological aspects of graph transformation
          o Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages
          o Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems
          o Structuring and modularization concepts for transformation
systems
          o Graph transformation and Petri nets

    * application to, languages and tool support for
          o Software architecture
          o Workflows and business processes
          o Software quality and testing
          o Software evolution
          o Access control and security models
          o Aspect-oriented development
          o Model-driven development, especially model transformations
          o Domain-specific languages
          o Implementation of programming languages
          o Bioinformatics and system biology
          o Natural computing
          o Image generation and pattern recognition techniques
          o Massively parallel computing
          o Self-adaptive systems and ubiquitous computing
          o Service-oriented applications and semantic web
          o Rule- and knowledge-based systems


Submitted papers should not exceed fifteen (15) pages using Springer's
LNCS format, and should contain original research. Simultaneous
submission to other conferences with proceedings or submission of
material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed.

Venue:

Located in the heart of England, Leicester is a truly multi-cultural
city. The city is a historic meeting place, where for centuries people
of different races and cultures have gathered, creating a rich and
unique heritage. This diversity continues today with a thriving ethnic
minority community accounting for more than a third of Leicester's
population. ICGT 2008 will be held at the University of Leicester's
conference facility next to the Universiy's botanic gardens.
