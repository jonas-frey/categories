Dear Michael,

Semantically, as Lawvere observed long ago, a monad gives rise not just t=
o
a category of algebras but also to a forgetful functor into the category
on which the monad acts. For any category C the functor

"semantics" : Mnd(C)^op --> CAT/C

whose object map sends a monad on C to its associated forgetful functor i=
s
full and faithful. Thus a pair of monads on C giving rise to isomorphic
forgetful functors must necessarily be isomorphic. So your observations
about different monads giving rise to the same algebras, while correct, d=
o
not tell the whole story on the semantic side.

The situation is of course different for sketches: they too give rise to
forgetful functors (into Set), but this does not suffice to determine a
given sketch up to isomorphism in the same way, and this justifies Steve
Lack's perspective of "sketches as presentations of theories".
