-- SCOPE --

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with
interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging
uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science.

It is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the
forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on
Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on
Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place
in Swansea (Wales, 2005), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Udine (Italy, 2009)
and Winchester (UK, 2011). The fifth edition will be held in Warsaw,
the capital of Poland.=20

-- INVITED SPEAKERS --

N.N.

-- TOPICS OF INTEREST --

We invite submissions of technical papers that report results of
theoretical work on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the
way these results can support methods and techniques for software
development, as well as experience with the transfer of the resulting
technologies into industrial practice. We encourage submissions in
topics included or related to those listed below.

  * Abstract models and logics
    - Automata and languages
    - Categorical semantics
    - Modal logics
    - Relational systems
    - Graph transformation
    - Term rewriting
    - Adhesive categories

  * Specialised models and calculi
    - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems
    - Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed, mobile, and
      context-aware computing
    - General systems theory and computational models (chemical,
      biological, etc.)

  * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
    - Abstract data types
    - Inductive and coinductive methods
    - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation)
    - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
    - Semantics of programming languages

  * System specification and verification
    - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification
    - Formal testing and quality assurance
    - Validation and verification
    - Generative programming and model-driven development
    - Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
      hardware/middleware/architectures,
    - Process algebra

-- NEW TOPICS --

This edition of CALCO will feature two new topics, and submission of
papers on these topics is especially encouraged.

   * Corecursion in Programming Languages
     - Corecursion in logic / constraint / functional / answer set=20
       programming
     - Corecursive type inference
     - Coinductive methods for proving program properties
     - Implementing corecursion
     - Applications=20

   * Algebra and Coalgebra in quantum computing
     - Categorical semantics for quantum computing
     - Quantum calculi and programming languages
     - Foundational structures for quantum computing
     - Applications of quantum algebra=20

-- SUBMISSION GUIDELINES --

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Experience papers are
welcome, but they must clearly present general lessons learned that
would be of interest and benefit to a broad audience of both
researchers and practitioners. As with previous editions, the
proceedings will be published in the Springer LNCS series. Final
papers should be no more than 15 pages long in the format specified by
Springer (see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). It is
recommended that submissions adhere to that format and
length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected
immediately. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included
in a clearly marked appendix. Both an abstract and the full paper must
be submitted by their respective submission deadlines.

-- BEST PAPER AND BEST PRESENTATION AWARDS --

For the first time, this edition of CALCO will feature two kinds of
awards: a best paper award whose recipients will be selected by the PC
before the conference and a best presentation award, elected by the
participants.  =20

-- IMPORTANT DATES --

Abstract submission:	February 22, 2013
Paper submission:	March 1, 2013
Author notification:	May 6, 2013
Final version due:	June 3, 2013

-- ORGANISING COMMITTEE --

Bartek Klin      (University of Warsaw, Poland)
Andrzej Tarlecki (University of Warsaw, Poland)

-- LOCATION --

Warsaw, the capital of Poland, is a lively city with many historic
monuments and sights, but also with a thriving business district. It
is easily accessible via two airports: the main Chopin Airport, used by
most international carriers, and the recently open Warsaw Modlin
Airport (30 minutes away by rail), used by budget airlines.=20

-- SATELLITE WORKSHOPS --

CALCO 2013 will be preceded by the CALCO Early Ideas Workshop, chaired
by Monika Seisenberger (Swansea University). The workshop is dedicated
to presentation of work in progress and original research
proposals. PhD students and young researchers are particularly
encouraged to contribute.

A workshop dedicated to tools based on algebraic and/or coalgebraic
principles, CALCO Tools, will be held alongside the main conference,
chaired by Lutz Schr=F6der (Friedrich Alexander Universit=E4t
Erlangen-N=FCrnberg). Papers of this workshop will be included in the
CALCO proceedings.

-- FURTHER INFORMATION --

Queries related to submission, reviewing, and programme should be sent
to the relevant conference or workshop chairs.
