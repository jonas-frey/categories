                         Types Meeting 2013
                     Toulouse, 22-26 April 2013

                        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The 19th Conference "Types for Proofs and Programs" will take place in
Toulouse, France, from 22 to 26 April 2013 - including the pre-conference
workshop PCC on April 22 and 23 and the post-conference workshop CSPM in
the afternoon of April 26. The scientific programme of the main event
is from the morning of April 23 (Tuesday) until lunch time on April 26.
For an overview of the whole planning, see the web site.

The Types Meeting is a forum to present new and on-going work in all
aspects of type theory and its applications, especially in formalized
and computer assisted reasoning and computer programming.

Invited speakers (abstracts are available on the web site):

* Steve Awodey,
   School of Mathematics, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, U.S.A.
   & Department of Philosophy, Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.A.
   "Higher Inductive Types in Homotopy Type Theory"

* Lars Birkedal, Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University,
   Denmark
   "Charge! a framework for higher-order separation logic in Coq."

* Ulrich Kohlenbach, Department of Mathematics, TU Darmstadt, Germany
   "Types in Proof Mining"

TYPES 2013 is intended to be a conference in our traditional workshop
style. The contributed talks were selected by the program committee on the
basis of abstracts of up to two pages (in EasyChair LaTeX style).

34 contributed talks were finally accepted for presentation, see their list
via the web site or directly at http://www.irit.fr/TYPES2013/accepted.html

The deadline for the final version of LaTeX sources for inclusion of the
abstracts into the abstract book is Monday, April 1st. The abstracts will
then be made available on the web site.

Post-proceedings of TYPES 2013 are confirmed to appear in LIPIcs (Leibniz
International Proceedings in Informatics), Schloss Dagstuhl, see
http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics
(the same publisher as for the last TYPES meeting in Bergen in 2011)
There will be a separate call for papers, and participation in TYPES
2013 is no prerequisite for submission to the post-proceedings.

The conference itself: Tuesday to Friday, April 23-26 (end of scientific
programme on Friday planned for 12:30)

The venue: Toulouse in the South West of France is the fourth largest
city of France and a lively university center with way over 100000
students. Toulouse offers numerous inexpensive accommodations,
including student residences. On the web site, there are links to
hotels and residences - even one of the latter only 500m walking
distance from the lecture hall of the main event.

Thanks to our sponsors, notably Universit?? Toulouse 1 Capitole,
granting the lecture hall in the city center, and IRIT (Institut de
Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse), the federative research
structure FREMIT and Universit?? Paul Sabatier (Toulouse 3) with
financial support (other sources pending), we are able to keep the
participation fee low. Moreover, we operate a scheme of additional
fee reduction for master and PhD students.

*** Early registration will be until      ***
*** Wednesday, April 3, 23:59 Paris time. ***

Access to the online registration system is through
http://www.irit.fr/TYPES2013/Registration.html
where the fees can be studied offline.

SATELLITE EVENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The twelfth international workshop Proof, Computation, Complexity (PCC 2013)
is held on Monday, April 22, and Tuesday, April 23. On Monday, this takes
place on the campus of Toulouse Technical University (which is well connected
by underground with the city center and the airport bus) and on Tuesday, this
is on the site of TYPES 2013.

The program committee of PCC 2013 selected 12 contributed talks on the basis
of short abstracts.

For the details, see http://www.irit.fr/TYPES2013/PCC2013/

Workshop CSPM "Computer Science, Philosophy, Mathematics",

a workshop hosted by the Mathematical Institute, and with financial support
by FREMIT.

Speakers: 14:30-16:00 Steve Awodey, 16:15-17:45 Ulrich Kohlenbach,
titles to be announced

The workshop aims to stimulate discussions between computer scientists,
philosphers and mathematicians and takes place in the Mathematical Institute,
which requires approximately 20 minutes walk + 20 minutes on the subway from
the main TYPES conference location.

There will be no extra fee for participating in the workshop CSPM.

A dedicated web page will appear soon and will be linked from the main page
of TYPES 2013.
