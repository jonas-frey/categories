                          July 20 - 24, 2009
                         organized as part of
                     the European Summer School on
                    Logic, Language and Information
                 ESSLLI 2009 <http://esslli2009.labri.fr/>
                     July 20 - 31, 2009 in Bordeaux

ORGANIZERS:

Michel Parigot (CNRS, Univ. Paris 7, France)
Lutz Strassburger (INRIA Saclay-IdF, France)


DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP:

The topic of this workshop is the application of algebraic, geometric,
and combinatorial methods in proof theory. In recent years many
researchers have proposed approaches to understand and reduce
"syntactic bureaucracy" in the presentation of proofs. Examples are
proof nets, atomic flows, new deductive systems based on deep
inference, and new algebraic semantics for proofs. These efforts have
also led to new methods of proof normalisation and new results in
proof complexity.

The workshop is relevant to a wide range of people. The list of topics
includes among others: algebraic semantics of proofs, game semantics,
proof nets, deep inference, tableaux systems, category theory,
deduction modulo, cut elimination, complexity theory, etc.

The goal of the workshop is twofold: first, to bring together
researchers from various fields who share the interest of
understanding and dealing with structural properties of proofs and
second, to provide an opportunity for PhD students and researchers to
present and discuss their work with colleagues who work in the broad
subject areas that are represented at ESSLLI.

The workshop is intended to be a sequel of the ICALP-workshop SD05 in
Lisbon 2005 <http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/ag/w/sd05>.


SUBMISSION DETAILS:

Contributions can be regular papers, but also work in progress,
programmatic/position papers or tutorials.  Submissions should be
formatted with the LNCS LaTeX style, take between two and fifteen
pages and allow the committee to assess their merits with reasonable
effort. The length limit can be relaxed for the versions that will be
presented at the workshop, depending on the total bulk of the accepted
contributions.

The accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published
by ESSLLI.  One author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop
in order to present the paper.


WORKSHOP FORMAT:

The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants.
It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive
days in the first week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 or 3 slots for paper
presentation and discussion per session. On the first day the workshop
organizers will give an introduction to the topic.


INVITED SPEAKERS:

IMPORTANT DATES:

Deadline for submissions: February 15, 2009
Notification of acceptance: April 15, 2009
Deadline for final versions: May 11, 2009

Workshop dates: July 20 - 24, 2009


LOCAL ARRANGEMENTS:

All workshop participants including the presenters will be required to
register for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors presenting a
paper will correspond to the early student/workshop speaker
registration fee. Moreover, a number of additional fee waiver grants
will be made available by the ESSLLI local organizing committee on a
competitive basis and workshop participants are eligible to apply for
those. There will be no reimbursement for travel costs and
accommodation. Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding
funding should contact the local organizing committee to ask for the
possibilities for a grant.
