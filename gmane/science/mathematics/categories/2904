Well, not quite.  In a taxonomy the identity axiom is not simply
removed, but replaced by a weaker requirement.  Essentially this
says that every morphism factors.  In the corresponding semigroups,
which I would call "interpolative", this can also be formulated as
follows: the multiplication  * : S x S ---> S  is a coequalizer of
S x *  and   * x S .  (This formulation can be lifted to taxonomies
as well.)  It would be interesting to know, whether the gadget that
prompted this question is a taxonomy in this sense.

[By the way, the term "taxonomy" resulted from a misunderstanding
on my part of a remark by Robert Pare and Richard Wood.  It has
since been abbreviated to "taxon".]

The notion of "category without units" also shows up in Azumaya=3D20
theory as studied by Francis Borceux and others.
