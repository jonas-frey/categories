Dear Giuseppe, dear all,=0A=
=0A=
I am shocked to learn that Bob Walters is gone.=0A=
I knew him from the time I visited Max Kelly in Australia.=0A=
He was a very friendly person with a good sense of humor.=0A=
And a good mathematician too.=0A=
He was an adventurer, both in math and in life.=0A=
The last time I saw him was at the CT2010 meeting in Genova.=0A=
I am using his work with Carboni and Kasangian in my latest paper=0A=
with Gambino.=0A=
=0A=
My deepest condoleance to his friends and family,=0A=
Andr=E9=0A=

Dear Bill, dear all,=0A=
=0A=
this is terribly sad news. I feared the worst when Bob did not show up at C=
ambridge for CT2014, but hoped that it was just a wrong feeling.=0A=
=0A=
The strongest and happiest link I had with Bob was in the organization of t=
wo major conferences at Como and Genova: in both occasions the many, strang=
ely difficult tasks which we had to confront always appeared easier than th=
ey were because of his willingness to make things work and of his amazing s=
ense of humour.=0A=
=0A=
My image of Bob is forever connected to cartesian bicategories (I, II, III,=
...). They constitute landmarks in the research in mathematics, and I am ce=
rtain they will prove fundamental in the philosophy of the subject in the d=
ecades to come. It is the saddest of thoughts that I shall not discuss it w=
ith him any more.=0A=
=0A=
At this terrible moment my heart is with Nicoletta and Sofia.=0A=

Pino=0A=
