Following a (private) suggestion by Thomas Streicher, a possible
candidate for a TPCA A such that Asm(A) does not have coproducts would
be the TPCA whose types are lattices and monotone maps (take countable
lattices if you like to worry about size). Note that taking algebraic
lattices won't do because those are injective and so they'll allow us
to define if-then-else by continuoulsy extending the interesting part
of if-then-else (I hope someone will understand what I am saying).

Also, I do not see at the moment whether we get coproducts for the
TPCA of total continuous functionals over the real numbers. More
precisely, let A be the finite type hierachy over the real numbers, as
generated in some super- or sub-ccc of topological spaces that
contains the reals.

Another candidate is the "syntactic" TPCA generated by the simply
typed lambda-calculus (with products) over a base type. Perhaps there
is a syntactic theorem which tells us that this TPCA does not have
"weak" coproducts (which is what is needed to get coproducts at the
level of assemblies).

Best regards,

Andrej
