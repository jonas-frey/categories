Dear colleagues,

I am writing in hopes that one of you will join me in our department next
fall. We are advertising one faculty position =E2=80=94 either at the tenur=
e track
or tenured level =E2=80=94 for an appointment to begin next July and expect=
  to
advertise more positions in the near future. (In particular, do not let a
two body problem prevent you from applying.) Algebraic geometry and
algebraic topology, broadly defined, are areas of priority for this search,
though we will consider exceptional candidates in all areas of pure
mathematics.

http://mathjobs.org/jobs/jhu
http://mathematics.jhu.edu

We are also are searching for an experienced teaching faculty member to
join the department as a Senior Lecturer or Associate Teaching Professor.
This is viewed by the department as a leadership position, with latitude to
re-imagine our existing course offerings, and intended as a long-term hire.
More details can be found here:

http://mathjobs.org/jobs/jobs/14278

In addition, we are looking to fill two three-year postdoctoral positions
for J.J. Sylvester Assistant Professors.

Johns Hopkins (note the unexpected =E2=80=9Cs=E2=80=9D) is a private resear=
ch university
located in Baltimore, Maryland. We teach a high proportion of the
undergraduate population because a large number of Johns Hopkins undergradu=
ates
(double or triple) major in the sciences, and we have around 34 PhD
students in our department as well as 6-8 postdoctoral fellows.

Research interests of departmental faculty include algebraic geometry,
algebraic number theory, algebraic topology, category theory, data science,
differential geometry, fluid dynamics, general relativity, geometric
analysis, harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, several
complex variables, statistical learning theory, and stochastic processes.

I=E2=80=99d be happy to answer any questions about the department or about =
living
in Baltimore. I=E2=80=99ve also copied my colleague, David Savitt, on this =
message,
who is currently the department chair.

Regards,
Emily Riehl
