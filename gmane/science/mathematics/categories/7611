********************************************************************

             Workshop on Algebra, Coalgebra and Topology
                 (part of the Wessex Theory Seminar)

                         University of Bath

                         Friday 1 March 2013

********************************************************************

The Technische Universitaet Dresden is one of the world's leading =
centres in
clone theory. An abstract clone, with nullary operations, is a mild =
rephrasing
of what category theorists call a Lawvere theory. They are also =
equivalent to
finitary monads, but the equivalence with the latter is far more than =
mild
rephrasing.

The notions of abstract clone and Lawvere theory have been developed for
several decades largely independently of each other. Much of the =
development of
Lawvere theories has been done in the UK, in recent years primarily in
association with the University of Cambridge. Duality has been studied =
for
both, with notions such as coclone, comodel and coalgebra prominent. =
Both have
interacted with computer science, and both have involved relationships =
with
topology.

Several of the key researchers in the two fields will meet for a =
workshop at
the University of Bath on Friday 1 March. Before lunch, Mike Behrisch,
Sebastian Kerkhoff and Martin Schneider from Dresden will speak on clone
theory, explaining the background and current research, with a view =
towards
categories. After lunch, Jiri Adamek and Martin Hyland will speak from a
category theoretic perspective; and late in the afternoon, we will have =
talks
more broadly about the topic from Nicolai Vorobjov, Uday Reddy, James =
Davenport
and Sam Staton.

We would like to invite others to participate too. If you are interested =
in
coming, please contact Cai Wingfield (C.A.J.Wingfield@bath.ac.uk).

PROGRAMME:

10:30 - 11:00 Mike Behrisch "A gentle introduction to clones, their =
Galois
theory, and applications"

11:00 - 11:30 Sebastian Kerkhoff "(Concrete) clones and Pol-Inv vs =
(Models of)
Lawvere theories and ???"

11:30 - 12:00 Martin Schneider "Clones and invariant relations in =
categories"

1:30 - 2:15 Jiri Adamek "Nondeterministic Closure Automata"

2:15 - 3:00 Martin Hyland "Algebraic theories: a general bicategorical =
approach"

3:30 - 4:00 Nicolai Vorobjov "Monotone functions and maps"

4:00 - 4:30 Uday Reddy "Automata theory for program semantics"

4:30 - 5:00 James Davenport "What can algebra tell us about pedagogical
correctness?"

5:00 - 5:30 Sam Staton "Abstract clones enriched in presheaf categories"

Abstracts can be viewed on the website for the event
(http://go.bath.ac.uk/wessex20).


VENUE: The meeting will be held in the (very pleasant) department lounge =
of the
Department of Computer Science, East Building, University of Bath
http://www.bath.ac.uk/about/gettinghere/maps/index.html.

By lucky coincidence, the Bath Literature Festival =
(http://bathlitfest.org.uk)
and Bristol Jazz and Blues Festival =
(http://bristoljazzandbluesfest.com/) will
both be happening on the 1st and the days following.


REGISTRATION FEE: There is no registration fee, but the meeting will be =
held on
a pay-your-own-everything basis. We will show you suitable places for =
morning
and afternoon teas and for lunch, either sit-down or take-away.


TRAVEL FUNDING: The workshop will be part of the Wessex Theory Seminar, =
so
there is a (very) small amount of travel funding available to those =
people
working at Wessex sites go.bath.ac.uk/wessex20. If you would like to =
apply for
it, please email Guy McCusker (G.A.McCusker@bath.ac.uk).


ACCOMMODATION: Few people are likely to need accommodation for a one-day
meeting, but if you do and need help, please contact us, although you =
can
probably find it as easily on the web as we can, for instance via
http://visitbath.co.uk/. You are strongly advised to book accommodation =
soon,
as the Bath Literature Festival starts that day and much of the =
accommodation
we normally recommend is already sold out. Participants might also be
interested in the Bristol Jazz Festival, which runs 1-3 May: Bristol is =
a short
train ride from Bath.


PROCEEDINGS: We plan to publish an ENTCS post-proceedings of the =
workshop if we
receive a reasonable number of high quality submissions of relevant =
articles.
We can discuss details at the time. The one caveat is that Elsevier now =
charges
$50/paper for publishing in ENTCS, which we may need to pass on to =
successful
authors.
