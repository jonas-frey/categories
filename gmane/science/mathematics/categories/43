Ah, good, thanks.  In that case it should be almost as easy, given a
suitably "easy" coalgebra structure X --> N x X, to define the transpose
N x X --> N of the unique coalgebra morphism X --> N^N.

The easiest one is forward lexicographic order (s < t when s(i) < t(i)
at the least i where distinct sequences s and t differ), which has the
order type of [0,oo), equivalently [0,1).

One way to see this is to replace the 0's in the usual binary expansion
of x \in [0,1) by commas and read the resulting comma-separated blocks
of 1's as tally notation.

Alternatively, any monotone bijection f: [0,oo) --> [0,1), such as
x/(x+1) giving one kind of continued fraction, or 2*atan(x)/pi for
"circular continued fractions", induces the monotone bijection
R: N^N --> [0,oo) defined coinductively as

   R(s) = s(0) + f(R(s o succ)).

These are among the coalgebraic presentations of the reals Dusko
Pavlovic and I spoke about in Amsterdam on 3/20/99 at CMCS, see ENTCS
19, 133-147 (1999), journal version TCS 280(1-2):105-122 (2002).

Reverse lexicographic order gives the irrationals, and is the one
usually encountered with the continued fractions used by "spigot
algorithm" programmers such as Bill Gosper, who don't seem to mind that
the space they're working in is totally disconnected.  This results from
not bothering to correct for the antimonotonicity of 1/(x+1).  Pedantic
spigot programmers who prefer working in a connected space can easily
substitute its monotonic complement, 1-1/(x+1) = x/(x+1), but
(digressing from mathematical reality for a moment) to what practical
advantage?  Presumably Brouwer would take Gosper's side here, it's not
as if the real line is going to crumble into dust when it becomes
totally disconnected by omitting a countable subset, it's still held
together by its metric.  Nature abhors topology.  A demonstrably
nondiscrete Hausdorff space in either nature or computer engineering
would be a great discovery worthy of the Nobel prize in physics or the
Turing award respectively.

Back to mathematical reality.

Freyd's post of 12/22/99 to this list introducing his presentation,

   http://north.ecc.edu/alsani/ct99-00(8-12)/msg00039.html

gives the general provenance for the coalgebraic approach to the reals
as our CMCS paper.  Our respective approaches to connecting up the bits
of our coalgebras to form a continuum differ mainly in that Peter
explicitly glues the abutting ends of 2xX ~ X+X together while we
exploit the open-ended nature of N (least but no greatest element, as
the discretization of a half-open interval) for a glue-less connection
at the expense of the additional induction needed when replacing 2 by N.
  The choice of poisons is therefore manual glue vs. double induction.

In light of your remark at the start of D4.7 that "there are different
constructions of the reals which are classically equivalent but may
yield different results in a non-Boolean topos," is there a topos in
which the order type of the Freyd coalgebra is not that of the (forward)
lexicographic ordering of N^N (modulo endpoints)?  Are they the same in
Grph, for example?
