         Dear colleagues,

This is the second announcement for the conference

         Categories for Homotopy Theory and Rewriting

              September 25 to September 29, 2017
                  CIRM, Luminy (France)

The conference will deal more generally with applications of categorical
methods in a broad range of fields: homotopy theory, rewriting, higher
categories, computer science, geometric group theory, operads, physics,
homological algebra and homotopy type theory.

The invited speakers are:

   Steve Awodey (Carnegie Mellon University)
   Fr?r?dic Chapoton (CNRS, Universit? de Strasbourg)
   Pierre-Louis Curien (CNRS, Universit? Paris 7)
   Ya?l Fr?gier (Universit? d'Artois)
   St?phane Gaussent (Universit? Jean Monnet)
   ?ric Hoffbeck (Universit? Paris 13)
   Martin Hyland (University of Cambridge) (to be confirmed)
   Andr? Joyal (Universit? du Qu?bec ? Montr?al)
   Joachim Kock (Universitat Aut?noma de Barcelona)
   Victoria Lebed (Trinity College Dublin)
   Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine (Stockholms Universitet)
   Simona Paoli (University of Leicester)
   Dominic Verity (Macquarie University)

Two mini-courses will be given:

   Philippe Malbos (Universit? Lyon 1), on Squier's theory for monoids and
     algebras
   Fran?ois M?tayer (Universit? Paris Nanterre), on homotopy theory of strict
     omega-categories and its connection with homology of monoids

A limited number of slots are available for short contributed talks. People
interested in giving such a talk should send an abstract to one of the
organizers before July 16, 2017.

Some (not so) limited funding is available to support participants,
particularly young researchers and those who may not have other means of
covering their expenses. Applications for financial support should be sent
to one of the organizers as soon as possible.

Further information and updates will be available on the website of the
conference:

   http://scientific-events.weebly.com/1773.html

Preregistration is open until July 16, 2017. To preregister, please fill in
the form on the webpage of the event:

We look forward seeing you in Luminy.

The organizers,
Dimitri Ara
