First Call for Papers

CSL 2010
Annual Conference of the European Association for Computer Science Logic

August 23=9627, 2010, Brno, Czech Republic

http://www.mat.uc.pt/=98csl/

Submission (title & abstract):  March 26, 2010
Notification:                   May 17, 2010
Submission (full paper):        April 2, 2010
Final papers:                   June 6, 2010

Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European Ass=
ociation for
Computer Science Logic (EACSL). The conference is intended for computer s=
cientists whose
research activities involve logic, as well as for logicians working on is=
sues significant
for computer science. The 19th EACSL Annual Conference on Computer Scienc=
e Logic (CSL 2010)
and the 35th International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Compu=
ter Science
(MFCS 2010) are federated and organized in parallel at the same place. Th=
e federated
MFCS & CSL 2010 conference has common plenary sessions and social events =
for all participants.
The technical program and proceedings of MFCS 2010 and CSL 2010 are prepa=
red independently.
The MFCS & CSL 2010 conference is accompanied by satellite workshops on m=
ore specialized topics.

Suggested topics of interest include (but are not limited to) automated d=
eduction and interactive
theorem proving, constructive mathematics and type theory, equational log=
ic and term rewriting,
automata and games, modal and temporal logic, model checking, decision pr=
ocedures, logical aspects
of computational complexity, finite model theory, computational proof the=
ory, logic programming and
constraints, lambda calculus and combinatory logic, categorical logic and=
 topological semantics,
domain theory, database theory, specification, extraction and transformat=
ion of programs, logical
foundations of programming paradigms, verification and program analysis, =
linear logic, higher-order
logic, nonmonotonic reasoning.

Proceedings will be published in the Advanced Research in Computing and S=
oftware Science (ARCoSS)
subline of the LNCS series. Each paper accepted by the Programme Committe=
e must be presented at the
conference by one of the authors, and a final copy must be prepared accor=
ding to Springer's guidelines.
Submitted papers must be in Springer's LNCS style and of no more than 15 =
pages, presenting work not
previously published. They must not be submitted concurrently to another =
conference with refereed
proceedings. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work sub=
mitted to a conference or
journal by March 19, 2010. Papers authored or coauthored by members of th=
e Programme Committee are
not allowed.

Papers will be submitted through the conference website. Submitted papers=
 must be in English and
provide sufficient detail to allow the Programme Committee to assess the =
merits of the papers. Full
proofs may appear in a technical appendix which will be read at the revie=
wers' discretion. Authors
are strongly encouraged to include a well written introduction which is d=
irected at all members of
the program committee.

The Ackermann Award for 2010 will be presented to the recipients at CSL'1=
0.
