Dear all,

This is the second call for participation to our little workshop /
summer school on Coinduction in Type Theory in Le Bourget-du-Lac, near
Chamb=C3=A9ry, France, from July 3 to July 6, 2017. Everything you need to
know should be at

http://lama.univ-savoie.fr/~hirschowitz/CoTT2017 ,

in particular, registration is open until June 15, here:

http://lama.univ-savoie.fr/~hirschowitz/CoTT2017/registration.php .

Briefly, the workshop will revolve around three mini-courses:

   - Henning Basold: Type Theory Based on Dependent Inductive and Coinductiv=
e Types,
   - Neil Ghani: Coinduction and infinite games,
   - Rasmus M=C3=B8gelberg: Guarded dependent type theory with coinductive t=
ypes.

Contributed talks are solicited on theoretical and more applied topics
having to do with coinduction and type theory =E2=80=94 preferably both! =
=E2=80=94,
particularly those not represented by the invited talks.

In the tradition of the R=C3=A9alisabilit=C3=A9 =C3=A0 Chamb=C3=A9ry worksh=
op series, the
organisers won't organise much, apart from the talks and coffee
breaks. In particular, lunch is not organised and registration is
free. Some things generally happen spontaneously, like a social dinner
and a barbecue near Lake Bourget.

The workshop website includes a few hints for accomodation and the like,
but please don't hesitate to contact us in case of further questions.

Hoping to see you there,
     Tom Hirschowitz
     Clovis Eberhart
     Pierre Hyvernat
     Rodolphe Lepigre
     Christophe Raffalli
