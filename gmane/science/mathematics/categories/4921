Dear Andrej,

The free monad on a category has a well-known simple concrete description.
Let Ordf be the category of finite ordinals and order-preserving maps.
        -->
0 --> 1 <-- 2 ...
        -->
(This is sometimes called the algebraicist's simplicial category - it
contains the topologist's simplicial category as the full subcategory of
non-empty finite ordinals. Ordf is simply called Delta in Categories for the
Working Mathematician.) Ordinal sum makes Ordf into a strict monoidal
category. The object 1 is a monoid in this monoidal category, and in fact
is the "free monoid in a monoidal category", in the sense that for any
strict monoidal category C, there is a bijection between monoids in C and
strict monoidal functors from Ordf to C. (There is also a non-strict version
of this fact.)

The free "category with a monad" on a category A is the Ordf x A, with monad
having endofunctor part (n,a) |-> (n+1,a), with the obvious multiplication.

More generally, the monoidal category Ordf can be regarded as a one-object
2-category mnd, and 2-functors mnd-->K for a 2-category K, are in bijection
with monads in K. Freely adding a monad to an object of K can be seen as
left Kan extension along the unique 2-functor 1-->mnd.

Regards,

Steve Lack.
