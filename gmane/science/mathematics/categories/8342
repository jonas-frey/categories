Dear Jason,

I=92m travelling at the moment, and can=92t look up details, but similar =
things have been
done in the past, in particular by Bob Walters. If you start with a =
monoidal category,=20
then you can define a bicategory with the same objects, and in which a =
morphism=20
from A to B consists of an object X and a morphism A=97> X @ B, where @ =
denotes=20
the tensor product.

There is a dual version in which the original category in which =
morphisms have the form A@X->B.

Your version is a combination of both of these. (Once again, you get a =
bicategory rather=20
than a category,  unless for some reason + is strictly associative.)

Another closely related notion is that of Elgot automaton, studied by =
Walters and various collaborators.

Regards,

Steve Lack.
