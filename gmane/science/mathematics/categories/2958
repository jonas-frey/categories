It's funny, but exactly that question of terminology
(prone, supine, etc) came up a few weeks ago in some
joint work with a student here.  I made the same case
to him, almost exactly, that Jean Benabou just made.
And one other objection: I'd like category theory no
longer to be regarded as nonsense in this country ---
it still is in many quarters, as I could easily prove ---
and such terminology is not exactly helpful to the cause!

Peter May

ps: Then again, I don't much like using the overused
words cartesian and cocartesian.
