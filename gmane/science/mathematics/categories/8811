If you know of any real world applications of category theory, please
let me know. I would be interested to know of clearly described
applications rather that anticipated ones using categories in background
theories.

When we speak about "applications of categories" or "applied categories"
we mostly or almost exclusively mean applying categories within
mathematics (or theoretical computer science), where we have categories
in algebra, topology, logic (and type theory), and so on. We do have
real world applications of algebra, topology, logic, and many other
branches of mathematics, but possible use of categories is then hidden
and/or indirect.

Therefore the question: Are categories applicable in the real world?

Application areas could be found within the public or private sectors.
In the public sector it can be e.g. within education and health, and in
the private sector in can be e.g. within energy, finance and
manufacturing.

If I receive more than just a few replies, I will make a survey of it,
and later on inform the mailing list about the survey.

Looking forward.

Best,

Patrik
