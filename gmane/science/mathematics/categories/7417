Claudio Pisani asked,

Well, those presheaves are exactly the "restrictions to C" of the =

presheaves on the grouppoid reflection (the grouppoidal 'quotient') of C
(by which I mean the category got by declaring invertible every C-morphis=
m).

Does that suggest "grouppoidal action of C" might work? I think I'd tend =

to lobby against the use of the prefix "bi-" unless there were *really* =

compelling reasons in favor of it.

Cheers, -- Fred
