Dear David,

> I have been plagued by the following question: does the classifying
> space functor commute with (co)limits?

The classifying space functor (from Cat to Top) does preserve finite
products.  It doesn't preserve all infinite products, e.g. let A be the
discrete category with two objects and consider the product of
infinitely many copies of A.  Nor does it preserve all colimits, as the
following example shows.

Let 1 be the terminal category, 2 the category consisting of a single
arrow, and 3 the category consisting of a commutative triangle:

1 = .
2 = . --> .
3 = . --> . --> .

Take the two different functors from 1 to 2.  The pushout of the diagram
in Cat formed by these functors is 3, and B3 is Delta^2, the standard
topological 2-simplex.  However, B1 is the one-point space and B2 is the
unit interval, so the pushout of B1 and B2 is an interval of length 2,
which is not homeomorphic to Delta^2.

This doesn't answer your question about sequential colimits, but maybe
it gives some helpful context.

Best wishes,
Tom
