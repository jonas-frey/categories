The paper "The Yoneda Lemma as a foundational tool" can be downloaded as

http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/yon.pdf

Section 1 attempts to bridge the gap between algebra and category theory
by treating the Yoneda Lemma from the viewpoint of universal algebra.

Section 2 expands on what I wrote about density on this list on June 28
under the heading "Yoneda Theorem < Yoneda Lemma < Dense Yoneda
Theorem", giving two characterizations of density that I call
respectively semantic and syntactic.

(Only two?  Kelly gives six characterizations of density in Chapter 5 of
his book at

http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10.pdf .)

Section 3 cleans up my several previous attempts, both on this list as
far back as 9/7/02 and at CT'04 in Vancouver, at explaining communes,
which can be understood as a categorification of Chu spaces as well as a
generalization of the Isbell envelope of a category.  It also gives some
applications of communes to combinatorics and ontology (shades of
categorial grammar!), and speculates on the origin of the distinction
between types and properties.

The "foundational tool" part has to do with my perception of density as
somehow more basic than functors and natural transformations, if
possible.  On the theory that there is little new under the sun that is
basic, I would be delighted to learn that there are even better ways to
conceptualize that idea.
