Actually, F isn't even a functor.  The unique arrow 0 --> Ub has to give a
canonical arrow F0 = 1 --> b, which there isn't.  You could choose one, of
course, but it could not be functorial.

Actually, I realized the answer to my question cannot be yes.  Here's why.
Let A be some complete category to be specified later.  Let d be a fixed
object of A.  Let B be set\op and Fa = Hom(a,d).  The right adjoint is
given by b |---> d^b.  It is not entirely trivial to show this, but if my
answer were "yes", then you could show that the class of objects that were
equalizers of powers of d would be complete.  It is obviously closed under
products but, over 40 years ago, Isbell gave an example in which it was
not closed under equalizers.

This much is true: if there is an equalizer of the form a --> UFa ===> Ub,
then a ---> UFa ===> UFUFa is an equalizer.
