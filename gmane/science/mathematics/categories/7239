Dear Steve,

you may want to check

Coherence for pseudodistributive laws revisited
F. Marmolejo and R.J. Wood
Theory and Applications of Categories, Vol. 20, No. 6, 2008, pp. 74=E2=80=
=9384.

and the bibliography there-in for the pseudo case (and for pseudomonads).=
=20
The standard reference for the 1-categorical case must surely be

The formal theory of monads

J. Pure Appl. Algebra 2 (1972)
