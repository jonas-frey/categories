Floris Geerts (Edinburgh, database person working with Peter Buneman)  an=
d I=20
are organising DBPL 2009 this year. This symposium provides an interface=20
between database and programming language research. I've been to a couple=
 of=20
meetings and think they're really good. In particular, over the years I h=
ave=20
found it invaluable to talk with people from database theory.=20

Following tradition,  the meeting is co-located with  VLDB in Lyon.=20
As well as the LNCS proceedings, we will be inviting the best  papers to
be  published in the Journal of Computer and System Sciences.

I very much encourage people to submit to this lovely meeting, and=20
hope that we will end up with a good showing of programming language pape=

CALL FOR PAPERS

12th International Symposium on Database Programming Languages
DBPL 2009
Co-located with VLDB 2009
Lyon, France. August 23-24, 2009.


http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/dbpl09/

-----------------------

The 12th Biennial Symposium on Data Base Programming Languages (DBPL
2009), to be held on August 23-24, 2009, in Lyon, France, continues
the tradition of excellence initiated by its predecessors in Roscoff,
Finistere (1987), Salishan, Oregon (1989), Nafplion, Argolida (1991),
Manhattan, New York (1993), Gubbio, Umbria (1995),  Estes Park,
Colorado (1997), Kinloch Rannoch, Scotland (1999), Marino, Rome
(2001), Potsdam, Germany (2003), Trondheim, Norway (2005) and Vienna,
Austria (2007).

Over the years DBPL has established itself as the main venue for
publishing and discussing new ideas at the intersection of database
and programming languages research. Many key contributions in query
languages for object-oriented data, persistent databases, nested
relational data, semistructured data, as well as fundamental ideas in
types for query languages have been first announced and discussed at
DBPL. Today's emergence of new data management applications like Web
services, XML processing, sensor networks and peer to peer data
management has lead to a new flurry of creativity in the area lying at
the intersection of data management and programming languages, and
DBPL is an established destination for such new ideas.

Important dates:
-----------------------

Submission of paper: May 3, 2009 (midnight GMT)
Notification: June 7, 2009.
Camera ready: June 14, 2009.
DBPL 2009: August 23/24, 2009.

Topics of Interest:
-----------------------

DBPL 2009 solicits theoretical and practical papers in all areas of
Data Base Programming Languages. Papers emphasizing new topics or
foundations of emerging areas are especially welcome.  Suggested, but
not exclusive, topics of interest for submissions include:

 -Data exchange
 -Data integration and interoperability
 -Databases and information retrieval
 -Databases and the Semantic Web
 -Database languages in Bioinformatics
 -Databases in computational linguistics
 -Declarative data centers
 -Managing uncertain and imprecise information
 -Programming language support for databases
 -Databases in e-commerce
 -Multimedia databases
 -Peer-to-peer data management
 -Stream data processing
 -Schema mapping and metadata management
 -Security in data management
 -Semi-structured data
 -Spatial and temporal data
 -Transaction management
 -Validation, type-checking
 -Web services
 -XML processing

Submission guidelines:
--------------------------------

Papers should be submitted in PDF via the EasyChair submission website:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Ddbpl2009

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. The proceedings will be
published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (lncs)
series (www.springer.com/lncs). Submissions should be no more than 15
pages long in the format specified by Springer. Papers longer than 15
pages risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

It is recommended that each submission begins with a succinct
statement of the problem and a summary of the main results. If the
authors believe more details are necessary to substantiate the main
claims of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix to be
read at the discretion of the committee. E-mail addresses of the
authors should be included on the title page. At least one author of
each accepted paper must attend the symposium to present their work.


Invitation for the best papers:
---------------------------------------

The authors of the best papers will be invited to submit extended
versions of their papers to the Journal of Computer and System Sciences.
