I will try answer your question, but my answer is wonkish.

First, a category can be regarded as a (simplicial) diagram of =
groupoids.
More precisely, every category C has a "Rezk nerve" RN(C)
which is a simplicial object in the category of groupoids.
By definition, we have

RN(C)_n=3DIsoNat([n],C)

for every non-negative integer n,
where IsoNat([n],C) denotes the groupoid of natural isomorphisms
in the category of functors [n]-->C.
The nerve RN(C) was first introduced by Charles Rezk in
http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9811037
The functor RN has very nice properties.=20
It embeds the category Cat in the category
of simplicial groupoids Simp(Grpd).=20
The embedding respects (ie preserves and reflects)
the equivalences defined on both sides,
where a map of simplicial groupoids f:X-->Y =20
is defined to be an equivalence if it is an equivalence levelwise.
It can be proved that RN is a right Quillen functor
with respect to the natural model structure on Cat
and with respect to the Reedy model structure on Simp(Grpd).

A dagger category can also be regarded as a (dagger simplicial) diagram =
of groupoids.
More precisely, every dagger category C has a "unitary nerve" UN(C)
which is a dagger simplicial object in the category of groupoids.
By definition, we have

UN(C)_n=3DUIsoNat([n],C)

for every non-negative integer n,
where UIsoNat([n],C) denotes the groupoid of unitary natural =
isomorphisms
in the category of functors [n]-->C.
The functor UN embeds the category DCat in the category
of dagger simplicial groupoids DSimp(Grpd).=20
The embedding respects the equivalences defined on both sides,
where a map of dagger simplicial groupoids f:X-->Y =20
is defined to be an equivalence if it is an equivalence levelwise.

I am afraid I dont have an answer to this question.=20
But I will think about the problem.


Best,
