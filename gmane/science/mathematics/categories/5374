They won it ... but how prevalent is the
subject in undergraduate programs?  Vector
algebra and analysis wasn't taught to engineers
until what, 1900 or later.  Now it is ubiquitous.

Absolutely no offense to existing books but what
about an energetic mathematician or two writing
a _Schaum's Outline of Category Theory_? I'd
expect it to sell off the shelves initially.
