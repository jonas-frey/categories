I assume that the question is about category-theory related quantum-ish=20
research.

Firstly, as several UK based category theory groups are already aware of,=
=20
we now have a network grant to support travel between UK category theory=20
related groups, more general travel, and events:
http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=3DEP/I03596X/1
funded by EPSRC, the main British funding body, and coordinated by Samson=
=20
Abramsky, Andreas Doering, Jamie Vicary and myself.  (I used to fund many=
=20
such events for the past five years with my personal EPSRC fellowship, bu=
t=20
that is now running out)

Concerning the Butterfield-Isham-Doering type topos approach to physics,=20
Steve Vickers has a decent grant from EPSRC, through their mathematics=20
panel (I think).  In addition to this, Andreas Doering has PhD students i=
n=20
the area funded by Oxford's Computing Laboratory.  There is also funding=20
in the Netherlands for this subject.  I am aware of two grants in Nijmege=
n=20
(Landsman, Jacobs, Moerdijk).

For the quantum computing related research that relies on monoidal=20
categories, there is quite a bit more funding, in part because of the=20
popularity of the topic of quantum computing.  Both Samson Abramsky and I=
=20
have five year EPSRC fellowships that buy us out of faculty duties, a=20
number of postdocs also had EPSRC fellowships, we have a number EPSRC=20
grants in the area, and many students are funded by the department or=20
university.  But we are also receiving/received substantial funding from=20
EU and US sources, e.g. Office of Naval Research that also sponsors the=20
MFPS meetings, and some charitable organizations.  However, currently
a substantial part of the focus of our group's research is on foundations
of quantum mechanics, but we complement this with actual tool design
(which fundamentally draws from categorical logic):
http://sites.google.com/site/quantomatic/

An example of the "impact" that this research has generated, and which=20
immediately has been recognized by EPSRC with a five year "career=20
acceleration" fellowship for Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, is a spin-off from the=20
categorical quantum computing research to natural language processing=20
(NLP) technology.  It started with a paper entitled "Mathematical=20
Foundations for a Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning":
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4394
which made it to the cover heading of New Scientist (this indeed counts
as "impact" with respect to REF):
http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/NewScientist.pdf
This work provides an algorithm that provides meanings of sentences given=
=20
meanings of words, relying on the common categorical structure of Lambek'=
s=20
pregroups and the category of vector spaces (both are compact closed).=20
The inspiration came from the categorical quantum computing research:=20
"meanings of words are "teleported" within a sentence so that they can=20
interact". :)

Concerning "impact" at the concrete technological end,=20
Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh and my student Ed Grefenstette produced a paper=20
entitled "Experimental Support for a Categorical Compositional=20
Distributional Model of Meaning" ("Categorical" as in Category Theory,
not as in categorial grammar, which is different of course) :
http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4058
accepted for Empirical Methods in NLP, the main conference on the subject=
,=20
which shows that for certain NLP tasks the algorithm implemented in a=20
certain manner yields way better results than existing methods.

While of course one can hide that category-theoretic backbone, these=20
results could never have been obtained without, and the diagrammatic=20
language for monoidal categories is a particularly useful tool here.

Finally, it's probably well-known that general categorical semantics in=20
computer science has been a well-funded area in the UK for quite a while,=
=20
and there are many faculty positions in the area, in Edinburgh, Cambridge=
,=20
Oxford, Manchester, Bath, Leicester, ...
