Dear category-theorists,

Many of you will be aware that over the years I have kept a record
of all talks given at meetings of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves
and Logic. I promised to make this publicly available on the
occasion of the hundredth meeting; and it has now been uploaded to
the website, at

https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~jg352/PSSL100/pssl100.html

Information on each talk is given in the form

Date; start time; speaker; current affiliation; title.

For reasons of space, when I started keeping the list (typed out in
hard copy in those days!) I omitted finishing times (so you have to
work out for yourself where the coffee-breaks came) and co-authors
of joint work. By the time I went over to using TeX it was too late
to reconstruct this information for the earlier meetings, so I
continued to omit it.

There are a number of gaps in the list (mostly missing titles or
affiliations); if anyone can help to fill in some of those gaps, or
correct any mistakes (of which I'm sure there are many), please
e-mail ptj@dpmms.cam.ac.uk.

Peter Johnstone
