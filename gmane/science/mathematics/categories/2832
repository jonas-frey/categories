	The "green stuff" is not the lower part of the lobster's alimentary
canal (a barely visible black "string"); it is the lobster's liver.
While the texture & flavor take more getting used to than those of the
white meat, the liver (known   slightly confusingly as "tomalley") is
perfectly wholesome, and should certainly be eaten. So, of course,
should the immature eggs (bright red & known as "coral") if present.
