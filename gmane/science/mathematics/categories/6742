                  CALL FOR PARTICIPATION:  CALCO 2011

4th International Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science

                        August 29 - September 2, 2011

                              Winchester, UK

                     http://calco2011.ecs.soton.ac.uk/

=========================================================================

              *** Early registration deadline: July 15, 2011 ***

                (accommodation only guaranteed until July 15)

 	     *** Programme now available from the website ***

=========================================================================


CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with
interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging
uses of algebras and coalgebras in computer science.

This is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the
forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on
Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on
Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place
in Swansea (Wales, 2005), Bergen (Norway, 2007) and Udine (Italy,
2009). The fourth edition will be held in the city of Winchester
(UK), a historic cathedral city and the ancient capital of Wessex
and the Kingdom of England.

CALCO 2011 will be preceded by the CALCO Young Researchers Workshop,
CALCO-Jnr, dedicated to presentations by PhD students and by those who
completed their doctoral studies within the past few years.

The programme of CALCO also comprises presentations of tools based on
algebraic and/or coalgebraic principles, that have been selected in the
context of a dedicated workshop, CALCO-Tools.
