Dear Mike and everbody
The converse result , as stated by Mac Lane, was what needed to be said in
1950, especially since it began to bring out that category theory has
content. What it's converse to, namely that when maps can be added then
the cartesian product has the mapping property now called coproduct, had
already been folklore for years... or if it hadn't been, how else to
explain the widespread terminological ambiguity concerning "direct sums"?
Perhaps a much older reference needs to be adduced.
Thanks for bringing this up.
Best regards
Bill
