Hi,

My name is Lars Lindqvist and I wonder if there are any packages which makes 
it possible to include diagrams in documents on the WWW in a conveniant 
manner? What I have in mind are packages similar to the existing packages 
for the creation of diagrams in e.g. LaTex.

Very simple diagrams can probably be specified using the table construct in 
MathML but problems occur quite rapidly as the diagrams become more 
complicated. MathML is simply not intended for specification of such 
diagrams. See e.g. the last paragraph in section 7.1.5.2 of the MathML 
specification http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-MathML2-19991222:

" Finally, apart from the introduction of new glyphs, many of the situations 
where one might be inclined to use an image amount to some sort of labeled 
diagram. For example, knot diagrams, Venn diagrams, Dynkin diagrams, Feynman 
diagrams and complicated commutative diagrams all fall into this category. 
As such, their content would be better encoded via some combination of 
structured graphics and MathML markup. Because of the generality of the 
`labeled diagram' construction, the definition of a markup language to 
encode such constructions extends beyond the scope of the W3C Math activity. 
(See http://www.w3.org/Graphics for further W3C activity in this area.) "

Following this suggestion I have made some initial attemts to construct an 
XML markup language for diagrams. I have also written a XSL (Extensible 
Stylesheet Language) schema that transforms diagrams specified in this 
language to a VML (Vector Markup Language) specification which can be 
rendered by e.g. Internet Explorer 5. There is a lot of work involved in a 
project like this so I am really interested to hear about other attempts and 
experiences before I continue.
