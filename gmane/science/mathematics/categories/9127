Dear Colleagues,

We are very pleased to remind you that this May, Professor George =
Janelidze will be the recipient of the prestigious Chaire de la Vallee =
Poussin 2017 (see http://www.uclouvain.be/784661.html) at the Universite =
catholique de Louvain.

On this occasion, professor Janelidze will give a series of invited =
lectures entitled "=46rom Galois theory to commutative Hopf algebras and =
finite topological spaces".

Abstract:
These lectures are about Galois theory, which begins with field =
extensions, makes several steps of wide generalization, and eventually =
arrives at a purely category-theoretic level, where it gets new =
motivation and many new expected and unexpected examples. These examples =
will be described, with special remarks on commutative Hopf algebras =
that appear as Galois groups, and the whole last lecture devoted to =
algebraic topology of finite spaces, where the Galois theory of covering =
spaces works especially well.

Schedule:
Tuesday, May 30, 16:30: "Evolution of Galois theory"
Wednesday, May 31, 11:00: "Categorical foundation"
Wednesday, May 31, 16:30: "Concrete Galois theories"
Thursday, June 1, 10:00: "Algebraic topology of finite spaces"

--------------------------------------------------------------

A Workshop on Categorical Methods in Non-Abelian Algebra will follow =
from June 1st to 3rd, 2017.

Please, let us know as soon as possible if you want to participate by =
sending a message to tim.vanderlinden@uclouvain.be.
Participants are warmly invited to present talks.
The deadline for registration and abstract submission is April 30, 2017.

Looking forward to seeing you in Louvain-la-Neuve,

The organizers
