I suspect the answer is no, for irritatingly trivial reasons.
If C is a pointed category (i.e. has a zero object), then any internal
distributive lattice in C has its top and bottom elements equal, and
so is degenerate (i.e. isomorphic to the terminal object 1). Hence
the free-distributive-lattice functor exists, and is the constant
functor with value 1. But I'm sure there must be examples of pointed,
finitely complete categories which don't have a free-semilattice
functor (though I have to admit I don't have one at my fingertips).
