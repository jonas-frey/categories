Dear Category Theorists,

with my adviser Damiano Mazza and his other student Pierre Vial, we are =
looking
for a name =E2=80=93 or even better, a reference =E2=80=93 for the =
following kind of functors:

Let C and B be two categories, F : C ---> D a functor satisfying, for =
all
morphisms f:c -> c' in C:
- if Ff =3D g \circ h, then there exists two morphisms k,l such that
  + f =3D k \circ l=20
  + Fk =3D g
  + Fl =3D h
- if Ff =3D id_a for a certain object a, then f itself is an identity.

These functors arise when applying the Grothendieck construction to =
relational
presheaves: P : B ---> Rel. Indeed, the category of relational =
presheaves on B
is equivalent (through the Grothendieck construction) to a category =
whose
objects are such functors over B.

If anyone could point us in a right direction, it would be much =
appreciated.

Best,

=E2=80=94 Luc=
