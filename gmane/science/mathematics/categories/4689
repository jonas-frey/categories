PSSL 88 - Second announcement
21/11/08

Dear All,

We are pleased to invite you to register for the 88th
Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic in honour of
the 60th birthdays of Martin Hyland and Peter Johnstone.
This will be held on the weekend of 4th-5th April 2009
in Cambridge, UK.

The conference will be based at Newnham College, with
talks taking place at the Centre for Mathematical
Sciences.

We have received generous support from the Morgan-Phoa
Family Fund, and the Department of Pure Mathematics and
Mathematical Statistics of the University of Cambridge.
Therefore we are delighted to be able to invite all
conference participants to a special celebration dinner
at Gonville and Caius College on the evening of Friday
3rd April.  We hope that you will be able to make travel
arrangements that allow you to join us for this dinner.

In addition, we are pleased to be able to offer some
financial support. In the first instance, we will make
this available to graduate students; depending on demand,
we may also be able to offer funding to young
researchers and others without grants.  We also aim to
keep the costs low for all participants.

If you would like to attend the PSSL please send an
e-mail to Eugenia Cheng, using the form attached below.

TALKS

We look forward to having a full programme of talks
celebrating the enormous contributions of Martin Hyland
and Peter Johnstone to a wide range of subjects. We will
fit in as many talks as time allows, but in the event
of an excess of offers we will give priority to current
and former students of Martin and Peter.

DEADLINES

If you are applying for funding, please reply by 31st
January, 2009.

To guarantee accommodation and/or your place at dinner,
please reply by February 28th, 2009.

COST

The residential cost will be 35 pounds per night.  This
includes bed, breakfast and lunch at Newnham College,
and of course the celebration dinner on Friday.  Please
note that Newnham has single student accommodation
with shared facilities. If you prefer en suite
accommodation, we can book en suite rooms at St
Catharine's college, for around 60 pounds per night plus
tax (subject to availability).  All participants are
invited to lunch at Newnham on Saturday and Sunday,
wherever they are staying.

In addition, for Saturday evening we have organised a
large group booking with a special menu at a restaurant
in the centre of Cambridge, serving Tapas and Paella.
There will be a set menu for 20 pounds.

PAYMENT

Payment will be by cash (British pounds) or credit card
upon registration.  Alternatively, if you prefer to pay
in advance, please ask for details.

This information can be found at the PSSL88 website:

http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/pssl88/

Here you can also find information about travel to Cambridge
and to Newnham College.  The list of participants will
be updated regularly and the schedule will be available
in due course.

We look forward to seeing you in April.

With best regards,

The organisers,


Eugenia Cheng <e.cheng@sheffield.ac.uk>,
Andy Pitts.
