I think this construction will not work since the set-theoretic
difference C\S is not a subcategory of C while 1 is a subcategory of D+1.

The collection of all partial functors from C to D is a partial ordering
due to the inclusion of definition domains. For each subcategory S of C
you have the functor category [S->C] and each inclusion functor
In_S,S':S->S' gives you a functor from [S'->D] into [S->D]. Combining
both structures (via an appropriate variant of the Grothendieck
construction] you should get a category with objects all partial
functors (S,F:S->D) and morphisms (In_S,S', \alpha:F =>
In_S,S';F'):(S,F)->(S',F'). Composition of partial functors is given by
pullback (inverse image) construction.

I don't know if this gives a bicategory put maybe it helps to have a
look in the paper of Barry Jay "Partial Functions, Ordered Categories,
Limits and Cartesian Closure (1993) "
