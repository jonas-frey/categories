Call for Participation:  Representing Streams II
=====================================================================

Dates:
------
* Tutorial week: 20-24 Jan 2014
* Workshop week: 27-31 Jan 2014
* Registration deadline: 30 Oct 2013

Location:
---------
Lorentz Center, Leiden, The Netherlands: http://www.lorentzcenter.nl.

Description:
------------
Streams are infinite sequences of symbols that are studied by both
mathematicians and computer scientists. Mathematicians are motivated by
combinatorial problems that arise from number theory or probability.
Computer scientists are motivated by specifying and reasoning about
infinite data types and ongoing computations.
     The workshop will bring together researchers from both disciplines
with the aim to learn from each other, exchange ideas and establish
collaborations.
     Representing Streams II will consist of a tutorial week and a
workshop week. In the tutorial week, experts will provide introductory
lectures to various topics and is not only aimed at PhD students, but
all researchers who are interested in broadening their horizon, and
making connections with other areas. In the workshop week, keynote
speakers and participants will be invited to present results and open
questions from their field. There will be ample time for participants to
cooperate on these open problems. The goal is not necessarily to solve
all of them, but rather learning from each other's approach to these
problems.

Programme:
----------
Tutorials during the first week will consist of 3x45min lectures plus
exercises.

Tutorials:
* Automatic Sequences (Narad Rampersad, Winnipeg)
* Ergodic Theory (Michael Keane, TU Delft)
* From p-Adic Numbers to p-Adic Words (Jean-Eric Pin, Paris/CNRS)
* Streams and Coalgebra (Jan Rutten, CWI Amsterdam & Helle Hvid Hansen,
RU Nijmegen)
* Tilings and Symbolic Dynamics (Anne Siegel, Rennes/CNRS)

The second, workshop week will consist of keynote talks, contributed
talks and work sessions.

Keynote speakers:
* Valerie Berthe  (Paris/CNRS)
* Joerg Endrullis (VU Amsterdam)
* Herman Geuvers (RU Nijmegen)
* Neil Ghani (U Strathclyde, Glasgow)
* Michel Rigo (UL Liege)

Participation and costs:
------------------------
Participation is free, and includes a workshop dinner.
For PhD students, we have a number of student grants available.
