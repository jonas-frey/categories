*********************************************************

FM2009 is the  sixteenth in a series  of symposia  of the
Formal Methods Europe  association,   and the second  one
that  is organized as  a world congress. Ten  years after
FM'99,  the  1st  World Congress,  the   formal   methods
communities from all over the world  will once again have
an  opportunity  to  meet.   FM 2009   will  be  both  an
opportunity to  celebrate, and an  opportunity to join in
when enthusiastic   researchers and practitioners  from a
diversity  of backgrounds and   schools come together  to
discuss their ideas and experiences.

The Programme Committee  of  FM2009 comprises 83  members
representing 46 countries.   For the technical symposium,
papers  on    every aspect   of   the   *development  and
application of formal methods for  the improvement of the
current practice on system developments*  are invited for
submission.  Of particular interest  are papers on  tools
and  *industrial applications* : there will  be a special
track devoted to this topic.

Many  have already joined  the celebrations. Springer has
offered a prize  for  The  Best  Paper;  this Award  will
include  free electronic access to the  Formal Aspects of
Computing journal for one year,  and a choice of Springer
books  up  to a  value  of EUR 250.00.  The  authors of a
selection  of  the accepted  papers  will  be  invited to
submit extended versions  of their papers  to anniversary
special issues of  reputable journals.  And there will be
more: watch this space.

It will  be possible to participate  in other ways: there
will be opportunities to propose tutorials and workshops,
a  Doctoral   Symposium,    a  tools    exhibition,   and
more. Complete and up to date information can be found at
http://www.win.tue.nl/fm2009/. FM2009 is also part of the
1st  FMweek  (Formal  Methods week),   which  will  bring
together a  variety  of events   in  the area,  including
TESTCOM/FATES  (Conference  on Testing  of  Communicating
Systems  and  Workshop on Formal Approaches to Testing of
Software),  FMICS (Formal Methods for Industrial Critical
Systems), and the REFINE Workshop.

There will be something for everybody.  So, put the dates
in your diary:

Submission deadline         4 May, 2009
Notification of acceptance  6 July, 2009
Final version               10 August, 2009
