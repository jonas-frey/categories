Eduardo quotes Mac Lane as saying
(paraphrased) If it hasn't been proved, it isn't mathematics

Much as I admire Mac Lane and owe much to him,
that's rather at odds with what most of us do
even those who insist on getting a proof ultimately.

case in point:

http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/2005-06/v18n2/04.shtml

if that isn't math, what is it?
(perjorative adjective of your choice) mathematics?

Was Newton doing *only* physics?
