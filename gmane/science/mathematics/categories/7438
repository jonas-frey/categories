Of course, these two don't stem from any "dictatory" or "professory", or?=

The question is not which sort of ending occurs more frequently,
-orical or -orial, but whether there's a "rule" by which a final
"-y" on a noun gets converted to a final, adjectival, "-ial".

I suggested earlier, by a long list of such nouns, that, if there is =

such a rule, it's more honored in the breach than in the observance.

Again, if there is such a rule, why does it not apply to the nouns
bigotry, burglary, comedy, empathy, felicity, poetry, progeny, prosody,
registry, sodomy, sophistry, story, symphony, therapy, ..., zealotry? =

We have neither storial nor storical, for instance (despite "historical"
(but not "historial") from history), nor ... (left to the reader) ... .

Even for words like memory, remedy, or testimony, the results of the =

*+y =3D> *+ial "rule" have meanings rather far from the adjectival =

"relating to the notion of *+y " meanings that most *+ical constructs =

derived from corresponding *+y nouns have.

Memorial, for example, is a noun, signifying an object serving to recall
a given memory, not an adjective signifying "relating to memory";
remedial, though an adjective, signifies, "serving to remediate", not =

"relating to the notion of a remedy"; and a testimonial is, again, a noun=
, =

not an adjective meaning "of, or related to, testimony".

Perhaps only arterial, from artery, comes close, but even it means
"flowing as through an artery", rather than "related to, or having to =

do with, arteries".

And alluvial, jovial, sartorial, are words in the *+ial camp that do not,=
  =

however, arise from any application of Peter Pease's proposed "rule",
any more than do radial or medial -- or their ^c^ counterparts
radical and medical: there is no noun alluvy, jovy, or sartory -- or
rady or medy -- to apply such a rule to, any more than there is a cony =

to engender conical, or comy for comical.

(Ah: and Pease's "rule" doesn't work on "frequency", either? How comial :=
