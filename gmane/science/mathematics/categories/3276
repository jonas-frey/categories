This reminded me of a long-standing torture: does anybody know an elementary
proof at least of the particular case when the base ring - thus the dualizer
too - has only two elements? (Demanded by Guram Bezhanishvili; I agreed to
try thinking on this one as it seemed somehow close to Boolean algebras,
but...)

Yes, yes?
