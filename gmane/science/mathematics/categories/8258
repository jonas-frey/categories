Dear Harley,

Thanks!

Actually, some of us were just discussing the possibility of writing a
second category theory book as a collaborative venture:

http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/07/basic_category_theory.html#c046968

(But personally, I've probably had enough book-writing for a while.)

Best wishes,
Tom
