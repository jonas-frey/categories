The following:

"In 1981 I [Lawvere] visited him [Grothendieck] in his stone hut, in
the middle of a lavender field in the south of France [...] subobject
classifier which, as he said, is one of the few ingredients of topos
theory that he had not foreseen. Later in his work on homotopy he
kindly referred to that object as the "Lawvere element"."
