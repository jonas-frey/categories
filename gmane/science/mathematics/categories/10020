Eugenia,

The manifesto looks great to me.

Subject: categories: Manifesto for Inclusivity

Dear All,

During CT 2018 we had an informal discussion session about issues of
diversity and inclusion in the Category Theory community and beyond. One
idea that arose was to write some sort of "Manifesto for Inclusivity",
which I then did, but after showing it to a few people I promptly became
too afraid to disseminate it any further.

At the highly galvanising workshop that Emily Riehl organised last month
on "Professional Norms in Mathematics", many participants urged me to
share it, come what may. So here it is.

I'm not quite sure what to suggest is done with it but here are some
suggestions:

a) Conference organisers who believe in it could include it (or a version
of it) on the conference website, in conference announcements, and even
acknowledge it out loud at the start of a conference.

b) Individuals could include it (or a version of it) on their own
webpages, as I have now done here:

http://eugeniacheng.com/inclusivity/

Incidentally, on this page I have also included a link to Spectra, the
association for LGBTQ+ mathematicians, where everyone can sign up to the
Out List or the Ally List.

http://www.lgbtmath.org/

c) Someone more technically adept than me could make a sign-up form so
that we could compile a list of people in the community who agree with
this.  In the meantime, if you'd like to put your name to it you could
email me privately and I could add names to my page manually until the
administration of such an ad hoc system becomes too much for me.


Best wishes,
Eugenia
