Triples has been down for a while, especially its ftp interface
with the outside world. Things seem to be back to normal again.
So if you have had trouble getting papers from our ftp site, 
please try again - things ought to be working.  (And please
let us know if you still have trouble.)

One thing has changed: we have a simpler WWW URL for the group's
home page.  The old URL still works, but you might want to update
any links you have to the new one:
  http://triples.math.mcgill.ca
(Individual team members may or may not also change their WWW
page URLs, but at present, only the old ones are active, so don't
try to "guess" other URLs based on the team one.  There are links
to all the team members WWW pages or ftp sites on the group page.)
