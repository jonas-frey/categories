Perhaps the closest that Weyl came to discussing things related to
categories and functors is in his marvellous address at the 1954
International Congress of Mathematicians when he spoke on the work of
the Fields Medal winners, Kodaira and Serre.  As cohomology and sheaves
featured prominently in their work, as well of course as spectral
sequences (at least in Serre's work), his writtren text, according to a
footnote more expansive than what he said at the Congress, goes quite
far in "explaining" what de Rham cohomology is, what additional
structures result when the manifold is a complex or Kahler  or Hodge
manifold, how there is a great interplay between the analysis of several
complex variables, linear partial differential equations, algebraic
geometry over the complex numbers, the Hirzebruch Riemann-Roch theorem
(which was actually a conjecture of Serre and was, of course, nd
generalized by Grothendieck to a relative statement valid over any base
field), the Serre duality theorem (discussed by Weyl, only over the
complex numbers), the theorems A and B (of Cartan and Serre), Serre's
work on homotopy groups, the Serre spectral sequence. the work of Serre
together with Hochschild on cohomology of groups and Lie algebras, ....
