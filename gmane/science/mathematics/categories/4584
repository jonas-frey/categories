I agree with Andre.  Encapsulating a group of mathematicians inside a =20=

single named entity fosters a kind of collaborative spirit in which =20
good ideas are not kept for personal use later but are shared amongst =20=

the community.  When ideas are shared in real time, good mathematics =20
can be produced faster.  Anyone who wants to join the collective can =20
do so, and the collective produces highly useful material.  Of course =20=

such an enterprise is orthogonal to name-recognition, and maybe to =20
getting tenure!  But there is certainly something good about it, as =20
there is about wikipedia and the open source movement.

I also agree that the internet could be used in a better way to =20
transfer knowledge of mathematics.  Math papers are written linearly, =20=

in the bottom-up (Euclid/Bourbaki) style, to some extent.  Whereas =20
words on paper are in this sense one-dimensional, computers offer =20
many more dimensions for knowledge transfer.

Even more interesting to me would be a kind of zoom-feature on =20
proofs.  Proofs are in the eye of the beholder: for example it has =20
been debated as to whether Perelman's 70 pages was a full proof of =20
geometrization.  Given a proof with a statement which one does not =20
understand, a mathematician may find himself reproving something that =20=

was obvious to (or wrongly assumed to be obvious by) another =20
mathematician.  The community could benefit if a mathematician who =20
proves such a statement then uploaded the proof, even in rough form, =20
to some kind of math wiki.  If it were well-organized, this math wiki =20=

could revolutionize how mathematics is done.  In fact, choosing the =20
"right way" to organize such a site may itself be a problem which =20
could produce interesting mathematics.

Whatever the case may be, I am all for the idea of a new Bourbaki-=20
style enterprise in some form or another.  I think it may first =20
require interested parties to get together at some physical location.
