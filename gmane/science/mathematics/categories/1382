This is interesting in connection with some previous discussion in
this list on "definability" of the mid-point operation "by
coinduction".

As it is well known, the mid-point operation is not continuously
realizable via binary expansions with the Cantor topology. 

(As Andrej Bauer and other people have mentioned signed-digit binary
expansions in this discussion, let me emphasize that, in contrast to
the above situation, all continuous functions [-1,1]^n->[-1,1] are
continuously realizable via signed-digit binary expansions with the
Cantor topology. Put in another way, the space 3^N = (3^N)^n is
projective over (the regular epimorphism) s:3^N->[-1,1], but the space
2^N is not projective over r:2^N->[0,1].)
