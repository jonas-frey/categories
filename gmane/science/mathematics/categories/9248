Moreno Andreatta has asked me to transmit the following information
which could interest young category researchers.
Yours
Andree

Full-Time Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Researcher/Research Engineer
in Computational Musicology, University of Strasbourg, France

   Applications are invited for a one-year post-doctoral Research
position and a one-year Researcher/Research Engineer position, both
based at the Institute of Advanced Mathematical Research (IRMA) of the
University of Strasbourg. The two positions are available within the
SMIR (Structural Music Information Research) Project supported by USIAS
(University of Strasbourg Institute for Advanced Study), in
collaboration with IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination
Acoustique/Musique). The project investigates the use of structural
mathematical methods based on algebra, topology and category theory in
the field of MIR (Music Information Research) and aims to build bridges
between different musical genres, ranging from contemporary art music to
popular music, including rock, pop, jazz and chanson.

   Applicants should have (or be about to receive) a PhD in mathematics
or computer-science with a significant musical background. Strong skills
in programming (e.g. Java, C/C++, Python, Matlab/Mathematica) are
essential. A knowledge of algebraic models in computational music
analysis and other symbolic approaches in MIR is an advantage.
Applicants will need to demonstrate a record of research success and the
ability to work independently and in a creative way. While French
language skills are not mandatory, a fluency in English is required.

   The two one-year posts are available, respectively, from 1st September
2017 and from 1st January 2018.
For further details about the SMIR Project, including the list of
institutional collaborations, please visit:

Applications must include a detailed CV with a list of publications and
a motivation letter.

Please do not hesitate to contact me for informal Inquiries,

Best regards,
