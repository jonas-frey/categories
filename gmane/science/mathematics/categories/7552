SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS:

                               TAMC 2013

         The 10th Annual Conference on Theory and Applications of
                         Models of Computation

                   Hong Kong, China, 20-22 May 2013

                    http://www.cs.hku.hk/tamc2013/

===========================================================================

The 10th Annual Conference on Theory and Application of Models of
Computation (TAMC 2013 http://www.cs.hku.hk/tamc2013/) will be held in
Hong Kong, China, from May 20 to May 22, 2013. TAMC aims at bringing
together a wide range of researchers with interests in computational
theory and applications.

Hong Kong is situated on China's south coast and is famous for its
skyline. Hong Kong was a colony of the British Empire until 1997 when it
was returned to China. It now thrives under the principle of "one country,
two systems", enjoying a high degree of authority and independent
judiciary. Hong Kong is often described as "East meets West" and is one of
the world's leading international financial centers.

Come and visit Asia's vibrant world city
(www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/index.jsp) and join the conference at the
University of Hong Kong (according to 2012 QS World University Rankings
HKU ranked 23rd in the world and 1st in Asia).

The main themes of the conference are computability, complexity, and
algorithms. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include:

algebraic computation
algorithmic coding theory
algorithmic number theory
approximation algorithms
automata theory
circuit complexity
computability theory
computational biology, and biological computing
computational complexity
computational game theory
computational logic
computational geometry
continuous and real computation
cryptography
data structures
design and analysis of algorithms
distributed algorithms
fixed parameter tractability
graph algorithms
information and communication complexity
learning theory
natural computation
network algorithms, networks in nature and society
online algorithms
optimization
parallel algorithms
privacy and security
property testing
proof complexity
quantum computing
randomness, pseudo-randomness
randomized algorithms
streaming algorithms

Submission instructions:
* Authors should submit an extended abstract (not a full paper), online
at:  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tamc2013

* The submission should contain a scholarly exposition of ideas,
techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison with
related work.

* The length of the extended abstract should not exceed ten (10)
letter-sized pages (not including bibliography and appendices.)

* Submitted papers must describe work not previously published. They must
not be submitted simultaneously to another conference with refereed
proceedings.

* Research that is already submitted to a journal may be submitted to
TAMC13, provided that (a) the PC chair is notified in advance that this is
the case, and (b) it is not scheduled for journal publication before the
conference.

Proceedings:
The TAMC proceedings will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science Series by Springer (http://www.springer.com/lncs).
Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the
conference.

Special issues of the leading journals 'Theoretical Computer Science' and
'Mathematical Structures in Computer Science', devoted to a selected set
of accepted papers of the conference, are planned.

Steering Committee:
Manindra Agrawal (Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India)
Jin-Yi Cai (University of Wisconsin - Madison, USA)
S. Barry Cooper (University of Leeds, Leeds, UK)
John Hopcroft (Cornell University)
