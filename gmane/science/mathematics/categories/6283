How should this terminology be applied when the property-like structure
is necessarily preserved by all morphisms?

A group can be defined as a monoid with the property that all of its
elements have inverses.  The inverse is preserved by all morphisms.

A Boolean algebra can be defined as a bounded distributive lattice with
the property that all of its elements have complements.  The complement
is preserved by all morphisms.

Are these merely "property-like structures," or are they actual
structures, despite being defined merely as properties?
