Dear Jamie,

I agree that there is no canonical choice of horizontal composition of
pseudonatural transformations, but that the various possible choices
are, in a suitable sense, equivalent.=20

Whether or not you should be bothered by this I can't really say. But=20
perhaps it's worth pointing out that there are various different =
possible
descriptions of the structure of weak 3-category, and not all of them =
include
a chosen horizontal composition of pseudonatural transformations. Some,
particularly, the simplicial approaches, include *no* choices of =
compositions.
Others include some choices of composition, but not this particular one.=20=

For example, the notion of Gray-category does include chosen composition
of 1-cells, and vertical composition of 2-cells, but does not include a =
chosen
horizontal composition of 2-cells.=20

Best wishes,

Steve Lack.
