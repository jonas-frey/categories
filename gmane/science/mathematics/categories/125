Bob Lubarsky has recently asked me a question I could answer only partially.
He is not reading this mailing list and so I forward his question (since I am
also interested in it).
The question is whether for nonisomorphic spaces X and Y one can always find
a formula in higher order arithmetic or in the language of set theory which
holds in one of the toposes Sh(X), Sh(Y) but not in the other.
More concretely he asked about the folowing 4 spaces

  R (reals)        R_{\geq 0} (nonnegative reals)

  Q (rationals)    Q_{\geq 0} (nonnegative rationals)

AC_N holds for sheaves over spaces in the second line but not for sheaves
over the spaces in the first line.
But I couldn't tell him how to logically separate R and R_{\geq 0} or
Q and Q_{\geq 0}.

The background of Bob's question is his work on "forcing with settling down"
(http://www.math.fau.edu/lubarsky/forcing with settling.pdf) providing a model
for CZF without Fullness but Exponentiation where, moreover, the Dedekind
reals are not a set but a proper class.
