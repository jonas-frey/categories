That's a good point.  However, I think we can get around it as
follows.  We can make finitely many choices without any axiom of
choice.  Thus, for any natural number n, by applying collection n
times, we can find *some* n^th iterate of the "construction".
(Formally, we prove this by induction on n.)  Applying the axiom of
collection again over the natural numbers, we obtain a set which
contains at least one n^th iterate of the "construction" for every
natural number n.  Taking the union of this set, we should obtain a
set of objects whose corresponding full subcategory contains at least
one limit of every finite diagram therein.
