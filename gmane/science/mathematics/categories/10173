Dear members of the Category Theory community,


Due to the coronavirus outbreak, many universities are moving activities on=
line. This is a great opportunity to open up ACT2020 to a broader audience,=
  with speakers from around the world.


The conference will take place July 6-10 online, coordinated by organizers =
in Boston USA. Each day there will be around six hours of live talks, which=
  will be a bit more spaced out than usual to accommodate the different time=
  zones of our speakers. All the talks will be both live streamed and record=
ed on YouTube. We will also have chat rooms and video chats in which partic=
ipants can discuss various themes in applied category theory.


We will give more details as they become available and post updates on our =
official webpage, act2020.mit.edu.


Since there is no need to book travel, we were able to postpone the accepta=
nce notification, and hence the submission deadline. If you would like to s=
peak, please prepare an abstract or a conference paper according to the ins=
tructions here: act2020.mit.edu/#papers.


** IMPORTANT DATES (all in 2020) **


   *   Submission of contributed papers: May 16

   *   Acceptance/Rejection notification: June 07

   *   Tutorial day: July 5

   *   Main conference: July 6-10


Registration will now be free; please register for the conference ahead of =
time here: http://act2020.mit.edu/#registration. We will send registering p=
articipants links to the live stream, the recordings, and the chat rooms, a=
nd we'll use the list to inform participants of any changes.


All the best,

The ACT committee
