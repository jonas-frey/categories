It's a structure.

Consider the following category C.
Two objects x and y, with hom-categories
C(x,x)=3DC(y,y)=3D{0,1}
C(y,x)=3D{0}
C(x,y)=3DM
with composition defined so that each 1 is an=20
identity morphism and each 0 a zero morphism,
and with M an arbitrary set. Any commutative=20
monoid structure on M makes C into a linear category.=20

Bill Lawvere uses "linear" for a category enriched over commutative
semigroups.  Obviously, if the category has finite products, this is a
property.  What about in the absence of finite products (or sums)?  =
Could
you have two (semi)ring structures on the same set with the same
associative multiplication?

Robin Houston's startling (to me, anyway) proof that a compact
*-autonomous category with finite products is linear starts by proving
that 0 =3D 1.  Suppose the category has only binary products?  Well, I =
have
an example of one that is not linear:  Lawvere's category that is the
ordered set of real numbers has a compact *-autonomous structure.
Tensor is + and internal hom is -.  Product is inf and sum is sup, but
there are no initial or terminal objects and the category is not linear.
