                 FOUR research positions available

           Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science
                       School of Informatics
                      University of Edinburgh

                     Mobility & Security group
                    http://www.lfcs.ed.ac.uk/m+s

                  Closing date: 30 September 2005


Following on from the successful "Mobile Resource Guarantees"
project, the Mobility & Security group at Edinburgh has four
research positions available, lasting from one to three years, in
two new projects working with proof-carrying code in Java.

 - Mobius: a European collaboration developing technologies to
   support trust and security in the next generation of global
   computers.

 - ReQueST: an EPSRC-funded project to equip e-Science applications
   with formal proofs of their requirements for memory space and
   processor time.

Both projects will involve working with Java, the Java Modeling
Language JML, logics for Java bytecode, and automated theorem
proving tools.  Activities will range from theoretical research to
prototype implementation, with considerable scope for international
collaboration.

We seek applicants with a strong background in computer science, in
particular the following areas: program logics and proof systems;
formal methods; type systems and static analysis; semantics of
programming languages; compilation techniques; mobile code; embedded
systems.

Candidates should have either a PhD or equivalent research
experience.  Please note that these are fixed-term positions,
associated with specific funded grants.
