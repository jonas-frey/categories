        CMCS 2008 Final Announcement
        Please excuse multiple copies

9th International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science
http://www.cwi.nl/projects/cmcs08/
Budapest, Hungary
April 4-6, 2008


Key Note Speaker: Dexter Kozen (to be confirmed)
Invited Speakers: Stefan Milius and Dirk Pattinson

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 11th European Joint
Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software ETAPS 2008
March 29 - April 6, 2008


Programme Committee

Jiri Adamek (chair, Braunschweig), Corina Cirstea (Southampton),  Neil
Ghani (Nottingham),  H. Peter Gumm (Marburg), Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen),
Clemens Kupke (co-chair, Amsterdam), Alexander Kurz (Leicester), Ugo
Montanari (Pisa), Larry Moss (Indiana), John Power (Bath), Jan Rutten
(Amsterdam), Lutz Schr=F6der  (Bremen), Tarmo Uustalu (Tallinn), Yde

Submissions

Two sorts of submissions will be possible this year:

Papers to be evaluated by the programme committee for inclusion in the
ENTCS proceedings:

These papers must be written using ENTCS style files and be of length
no greater than 20 pages. They must contain original contributions, be
clearly written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison
with related work. If a submission describes software, software tools,
or their use, it should include all source code that is needed to
reproduce the results but is not publicly available. If the additional
material exceeds 5 MB, URL's of publicly available sites should be
provided in the paper.

Short contributions:

These will not be published but will be compiled into a technical
report of the Technical University of Braunschweig. They should be
no more than two pages and may describe work in progress, summarise
work submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere, or in some
other way appeal to the CMCS audience.

Both sorts of submission should be submitted in postscript or pdf form
as attachments to an email to cmcs08@cwi.nl.  The email should
include the title, corresponding author, and, for the first kind of
submission, a text-only one-page abstract.

After the workshop, we expect to produce a journal proceedings of
extended versions of selected papers to appear in Theoretical
Computer Science.
