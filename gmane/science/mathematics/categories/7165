The key here is to understand what to mean by "in a similar manner,"
and for that one needs to understand what the "manner" is by which
one comes up with the diagonal morphisms themselves originally.

As I see it, the original "manner" for the diagonal morphism is this:
in the category of Sets, the only function available from 2 to 1 is the =

universal example (in contravariant form) of such a diagonal morphism --

1) in Sets^op, 2 is the product of two copies of 1, and the function
just mentioned is that diagonal morphism of yours for that product;

2) anywhere at all, your "diagonal morphism" C --> C*C is just what =

that function from 2 to 1 induces as morphism from C^1 (which "is" C) =

to C^2 (which "is" your C*C).

So, now, by "similar manner" I would have to understand some sort of =

family of maps C*C --> C or C^2 --> C^1 induced by some 1 --> 2.
Well, there are only two functions 1 --> 2 (the two injections), =

and neither of them does what you'd like (not even in any particular =

special case of C).

What this proves, beyond any shadow of a doubt, is that, if there *is*
any sense of "similar manner" for which your question has an affirmative
answer, it sure as heck isn't what "I would have to understand," as
just described. =


What's worse, I wouldn't expect to achieve *any* uniform ways of coming u=
p
with maps C*C --> C that deliver binary products in the case of a categor=
y
C that *has* products -- what, after all, could it be delivering for a =

category C that just happens *not* to be "closed under products" :-) ?

Does this help you at all? Cheers -- Fred
