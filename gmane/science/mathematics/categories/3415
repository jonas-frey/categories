My request for precursors to Mike Barr's deprecation of set membership
seems to have set loose a thread that has veered off from set theory
into model theory.  The following extract from the introduction to
Gerald Sacks' "Saturated Model Theory" (335 pages, W.A. Benjamin, 1972)
serendipitously ties up this loose thread while at the same time
promising that category theory offers deeper insight into categoricity,
a central notion of model theory, than the alternatives.

"It is true that model theory bears a disheartening resemblance to set
theory, a fascinating branch of mathematics with little to say about
fundamental logical questions, and in particular to the arithmetic of
cardinals and ordinals.  But the resemblance is more of manners than of
ideas, because the central notions of model theory are absolute, and
absoluteness, unlike cardinality, is a logical concept.  That is why
model theory does not founder on that rock of undecidability, the
generalized continuum hypothesis, and why the Los conjecture is
decidable: A theory T is k-categorical if all models of T of cardinality
k are isomorphic.  Los conjectured and Morley proved (Theorem 37.4) that
if a countable theory is k-categorical for some uncountable k, then it
is k-categorical for every uncountable k.  The property 'T is
k-categorical for every uncountable k' is of course an absolute property
of T.

The notion of rank of 1-types was invented by Morley to prove Los's
conjecture.  There are proofs of it that make no mention of rank, but
they leave one ill-prepared to prove Shelah's uniqueness theorem
(Section 36).  I have made rank a central idea of the book, because it
is the central idea of current model theory.  ...  Morley's notion of
rank was inspired by the Bendixson differentiation of a closed subset of
a compact Hausdorff space; however, the Morley derivative differs from
the Cantor-Bendixson derivative in that the former commutes with the
inverse limit operation.  The Morley derivative is expounded in section
29 as a transformation which acts on functors of a class common in model
theory.  One advantage of a category theoretic treatment of Morley rank
is that it applies equally well to other notions [Shelah] of rank of
1-types.  Section 25 reviews the apparatus of category theory needed in
section 29."

The difference between this recommendation of category theory for model
theory and (for example) the literature on accessible categories is that
Sacks was not a card-carrying category theorist but a recursion
theorist.  While category theory has no bias towards Goedel's notion of
absoluteness (that I'm aware of), it seems reasonable to infer from
Sacks' acceptance of CT that neither is CT biased away from absoluteness
but rather is a neutral general-purpose tool.
