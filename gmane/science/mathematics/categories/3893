Some helpful discussion with Dana Scott and Fred Linton got me to the
point where I felt I could say reasonably succinctly exactly what a
Euclidean space is (or ought to be).  The following summarizes my
present understanding, which is a lot clearer than 24 hours ago.

I've seen only two essentially different approaches so far, bottom-up
(adding structure) and top-down (forgetting structure).

Bottom-up:

     A Euclidean space is
     an affine space transformable only by similarities.

Since affine spaces are already understood to be transformable only by
affinities, the further restriction to similarities is equivalent to the
preservation of circles, or of right isosceles triangles.  Affine spaces
are in turn definable as an affine-closed subspace of a projective space
transformable only by affinities.

Constraining the morphisms in this way is morally equivalent to adding
structure (of some unspecified kind), whence "bottom-up".

Top-down:

     A Euclidean space is
     a torsor for a Euclidean inner product space E.

A torsor, or principal homogeneous space, is (in this instance) a
generalized metric space with vector distances in place of real
distances so as to make the triangle inequality an equality, with d(x,y)
= -d(y,x) and d(x,y) = 0 iff x = y.  Like metric spaces torsors have no
origin.  E supplies the distances.  I put "Euclidean" as a modifier for
"inner product space" to connote the liberalization of morphisms thereof
to preserving inner product only up to a constant factor (as opposed to
the presumed default of on the nose).  This liberalization accommodates
scaling, and can be considered as forgetting the scale.  That and
torsors for forgetting the origin makes this approach "top-down."

I've used both approaches in software for things like surveying and
computer graphics, using respectively top-down and bottom-up.  Top-down
is simple at a low level, is primarily vector oriented, involves little
or no multiplication, and works fine with single-precision floating
point or even fixed point arithmetic.  Bottom-up is simple at a high
level (if you don't try to follow the individual arithmetic steps when
debugging), uses an extra dimension to express projective geometry
(needed to represent the part at infinity dropped when passing to affine
space), is primarily matrix oriented, involves lots of multiplication,
and benefits from double precision.  All high-end video cards today use
bottom-up exclusively, understandable for rendering which needs
projective rather than Euclidean geometry, but its benefits for rigid
solid modeling over top-down are less clear to me, though for
articulated solid modeling bottom-up seems preferable.

What other approaches to defining Euclidean space have been proposed?
