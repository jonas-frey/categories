It's interesting, I think, that two categories A and B are equivalent if
and only if there exists a span

    A <-- X --> B

of functors that are full and faithful and *genuinely* surjective on
objects.

What's interesting is that "full and faithful and genuinely surjective on
objects" is a purely graph-theoretic condition: it doesn't refer to the
category structures.  This suggests a pain-free way of defining
equivalence of n-categories, an idea I learned from Carlos Simpson.

For example, if I remember correctly, two bicategories A and B are
biequivalent if and only if there exists a span

    A <-- X --> B

of strict functors that are surjective at every level, i.e. locally
faithful, locally full, locally surjective on objects, and surjective on
objects.
