Mike,
   I think there may be some confusion here. Adobe Acrobat 8 costs
about $450, and it will produce pdf files from various inputs. I
assume at this price, it will produce files that Adobe Reader 8
displays properly. Adobe Reader 8 is free, but it only has the
capability of displaying pdf files, not creating them. I wonder if it
is Reader that's the culprit here, by not displaying the ligatures
you list properly if the files are created by some method that
doesn't use Acrobat. If so, there's no need to abandon pdf as a
preferred format - just caution users to view them in Acrobat 7 until
Adobe "fixes the problem" (sic). In particular, using the now-
standard methods built into most (La)TeX distributions should still
generate pdf files that will display correctly on most pdf apps -
Preview.app for Macs and xpdf for Linux or other UNIX-based systems.
No longer being a Windows user, I am not sure what alternative pdf
file viewers are available for it, but this seems an ideal
opportunity for someone to create one to fill an obvious need.
   In any case, using dvi as the preferred format has its drawbacks.
Notably, it is binary, and hence can't be included in emails without
extra effort. It also generates files that usually are considerably
larger than corresponding pdf files, which makes sending them as
email attachments a problem: most email servers now limit the size of
attachments (the server at Tulane, which is admittedly more
restrictive than most, simply throws such emails away, warning
neither the sender nor the receiver), which forces one to place the
files online for others to download them.
   In any case, I think more research is needed before a move like
the one you are proposing for TAC is warranted. And, I'd be
interested to know the exact nature of the problem.
   Best regards,
   Mike
