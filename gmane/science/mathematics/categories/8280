Dear George,

When you say
> I don't want us to live on different planets - so, I am making one =
more attempt:
I agree with you and could repeat word for word this sentence.

But I disagree totally with you when you say:
> My feeling is that you interpret everything I say as "some kinds of =
mathematical objects are better than fibrations" ("some kinds" could be =
indexed categories, or pseudo-fibrations, or, say, semi-left exact =
reflections).And then you give convincing examples where the language of =
fibrations works better,
I never said, or even hinted, that fibered categories are better than =
pseudo fibrations or semi-left exact reflections, but only that they are =
different and, in particular for semi-left exact reflections that the =
analogy was totally superficial.
And I gave many many mathematical arguments to show how radically =
DIFFERENT they were.

> and then you say that you could not convince me.
These arguments didn't convince you,and I just stated that fact.
>=20
> I NEVER said that any of those concepts is better!
I never reproached you that!

> All I was trying to say (more than once) is that all of them, =
including fibrations, are very important.
you don't have to convince me of that, except for indexed categories =
which I consider as a VERY BAD approach to fibered ones. I have for =
years said so, WITH MATHEMATICAL ARGUMENTS, which have not convinced =
you, but seem to convince more and more people.

> Moreover, the relationship between them - which is not exactly an =
equivalence - is a very serious mathematical result/discovery/idea,
Sorry, I shall seem to you very dumb but I don't see much relation =
between left-exact reflections and fibered categories. But you can =
easily convince me if you give many MATHEMATICAL arguments showing the =
two notions are DEEPLY related.

> By the way, a very 'small part' of the relationship between fibrations =
and indexed categories, namely the equivalence between discrete =
fibrations over a category C (with small fibres) and functors =
C^op-->Sets, is already a fundamental result, is not it? Well, working =
with discrete fibrations eliminates sets to a larger extend: e.g. we =
don't need to think of small fibres, and we can internalize them (I =
mean, define discrete fibrations over an internal category).
You made both the question and the answer. Discrete fibrations can be =
internalized, and this internalization is very important, e.g. in Topos =
theory, but Set valued functors cannot!
=20
> But does it mean that we should forget about Set-valued functors?
Of course not! But category theory has taught us how to generalize =
CORRECTLY well known notions.
>=20
> I know everything I said is trivial for you, but, forgive me, you =
forced me.
I NEVER said, nor hinted that ANYTHING you said was trivial, even when I =
disagreed with SOME of the things you said.

Best regards,
Jean
