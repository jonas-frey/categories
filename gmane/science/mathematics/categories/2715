[and one more...]

In reply to the question from Oswald Wyler <owyler@suscom-maine.net>
let me quote from Donald E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming
(1968, 1973), Section 1.2.8:

The number $\phi$ itself has a very interesting history.  Euclid
called it the "extreme and mean ratio"; the ratio of A to B
is the ratio of (A+B) to A, if the ratio of A to B is $\phi$.
Renaissance writers called it the "divine proportion"; and in the
last century it has commonly been called the "golden ratio".  In
the art world, the ratio of $\phi$ to 1 is said to be the most
pleasing proportion aesthetically, and this opinion is confirmed
from the standpoint of computer programming aesthetics as well.
For the story of $\phi$, see the excellent article "The Golden
Section, Phyllotaxis, and Whythoff's Game", by H.S.M. Coxeter,
Scripta Math. 19 (1953), 135-143, and see also Chapter 8 of
The 2nd Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions,
by Martin Gardner (New York:  Simon and Schuster, 1961).
