The Eduard Cech center had been established in 2005 and, since 2012, it 
continues as the national research center focusing its attention to 
interactions between algebra, geometry, and mathematical physics. The 
participating institutions are Faculty of Science of Masaryk University in 
Brno, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University in 
Prague, Institute of Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech 
Republic and the Mathematics Institute of the Silesian University in Opava 
(see http://eci.sci.muni.cz).

The Center invites applications for several research positions commencing 
during the academic year 2017/2018 at the date depending on mutual 
agreement. The positions are initially for one year with a possibility of 
extension. The candidates must be recent PhD's and should submit a letter 
of application accompanied by a CV, list of publications and an outline of 
their research project to Professor Jiri Rosicky (rosicky@math.muni.cz) 
not later than

                                        February 28, 2017.

They should also arrange for at least 2 letters of recommendation (one can 
be from a Czech mathematician) to be mailed directly to 
rosicky@math.muni.cz before February 29, 2017. The successful applicants 
will be notified as soon as possible but not later than April 30, 2017.
