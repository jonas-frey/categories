If I correctly understand what is proposed for an "equitable" or
"fair" journal (as you prefer!), I think the "Cahiers de Topologie et
Geometrie Differentielle Categoriques" can be so classified.

Up to 1975 the "Cahiers" had some support from the CNRS. However for
the last 30 years we have published them (at a very cheap price),
without any financial nor clerical subvention, with only the revenue
of the subscriptions which (scarcely) pay for the printer and the
stamps. I do all the material work (preparation of the final version
of the volume for the printer, preparation of the envelopes and
sending of the volumes, registration of the subscriptions,...) without
any help. I even pay personally for the simple computer material
necessary to handle them (that explains why I need well prepared .pdf
files from the authors...).

Though the "Cahiers" seemed forgotten by the French establishment, I
have been pleasantly surprised to recently receive an offer from
NUMDAM to post them on the Internet (without any cost for me). In fact
the 7 first volumes are already posted under the heading "Seminaire
Ehresmann" (which was their initial title or sub-title); at the address
http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?j=SE&sl=0*

The following volumes should be numerized in 2007 (I have agreed with
the terms of the contract and should incessantly receive its final
version to sign). After that NUMDAM will post each volume 2 years
after its paper publication. I hope you'll help me by avoiding to
substantially decrease the number of subscriptions which are vital for
the journal's continuation.

With all my best wishes to all
Andree Ehresmann
