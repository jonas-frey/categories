Dear Richard,

That's an ingenious idea, but I don't think it helps. The
factorization system is indeed a well-known one: it's the
hyperconnected--localic factorization [proof below], and
it is indeed true that M-maps into Set[O] correspond to
single-sorted geometric theories (Elephant, D3.2.5). But
every morphism Set --> Set[O] (in particular the one which
classifies the real numbers) is localic, so you just end up
with the topos of sets.

Here's the proof. The morphisms you describe are all localic,
so it's enough to prove that any morphism orthogonal to them all
is hyperconnected. But orthogonality to the last morphism you
list, for a morphism f: F --> E, says precisely that if m is
a mono in E and f^*(m) is iso then m is iso, i.e. that f is
surjective. Then orthogonality to the first group (actually
you only need the case n=1) says that f^* is `full on subobjects',
i.e. that every subobject of f^*(A) is of the form f^*(B) for a
unique (up to isomorphism) B >--> A. Applying this to the graphs
of morphisms, you get that f^* is full in the usual sense;
applying it to arbitrary subobjects, you get the criterion for
hyperconnectedness given in Elephant, A4.6.6(ii).
