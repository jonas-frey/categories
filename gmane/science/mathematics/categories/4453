* About DistriNet

The "Distributed systems and computer Networks=E2" (DistriNet) research
group was founded in 1984 as part of the Department of Computer Science
at the K.U.Leuven. DistriNet's research focus and scope is twofold:
distributed software=E2 and secure software.
The group works on a wide range of topics including computer networks,
middleware, internet architectures, network and software security,
embedded systems and multi-agent systems. DistriNet's research is generally
application driven and often conducted in collaboration with industry
partners.

Currently DistriNet counts 60 members (8 professors, 12 post-docs and
45 junior researchers) and participates in about 30 national and
international research projects. The annual budget amounts to approximately
5MEuro. More information on projects and publications can be found on the
DistriNet web pages:

* About Leuven

Lively Leuven is a  picturesque and upbeat Flemish city, just 25km from
Brussels, and within 3 hours of major European centres such as Antwerp,
Amsterdam, London and Paris. Leuven is shaped by its healthy student
population - some 25,000 of them - more than a quarter of the town's
