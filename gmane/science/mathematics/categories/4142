Dear Colleague,

Your are cordially invited you to submit a paper to the special theme issue
"Interactions of Algebraic & Coalgebraic Structures (Theory and
Applications)" of the AJSE (The Arabian Journal of Science and Engineering).

The special theme issue is planned to be published in December 2008
(deadline for submitting papers is June 1st, 2008.).

The main topics of the theme issue are
. Algebras and Coalgebras
. Hopf Algebras
. Corings and Comodules
. Bialgebroids & Hopf Algebroids
. Quantum and Lie Groups
. Non-commutative Geometry
. Categorical Aspects
. Applications in Physics
. Applications in Logic, Universal Algebra & Computer Science

More details are in the attached call for papers (in PDF-format).

I appreciate it much, if you would inform me if you are likely to submit a
contribution (so that we can have an approximation of the number of papers
we expect to handle).

Your contribution is highly appreciated.

With best regards,
Jawad
