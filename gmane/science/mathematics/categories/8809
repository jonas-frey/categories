Funded Doctoral Positions in Computer Science [http://logic-cs.at/phd/]

TU Wien, TU Graz, and JKU Linz are seeking exceptionally talented and
motivated students for their joint doctoral program LogiCS. The LogiCS
doctoral college focuses on interdisciplinary research topics covering

(i) computational logic, and applications of logic to
(ii) databases and artificial intelligence as well as to
(iii) computer-aided verification.

THE PROGRAM

LogiCS is a doctoral college focusing on logic and its applications in
computer science. Successful applicants will work with and be
supervised by leading researchers in the fields of computational
logic, databases and knowledge representation, and computer-aided
verification.
