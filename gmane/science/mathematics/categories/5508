Dear all,

   this message continues the discussion about the "evil" aspect of the=20
definition of a dagger category. In part I would like to give some=20
support to Dusko Pavlovic's message and also stress the relationship=20
with another concept (that of a pivotal, aka sovereign category).

  Call a functor (-)^*:E->E^{op} an *involution* of E if (-)^* is=20
faithful and self-adjoint. The latter means that there is a binatural=20
bijection between maps A->B^* and B->A^* for all objects A,B of E. The=20
unit (and counit) of this adjunction is a natural transformation=20
i_A:A->A^** which is supposed to be monic in E by faithfulness of (-)^*,=20
and which fulfills the triangular identity id_{A^*}=3D(i_A)^*i_(A^*) by=20
self-adjointness of (-)^*.

  Call a category E *involutive *if E comes equipped with an involution=20
(-)^*:E-> E^{op}. Involutions may be transported along adjoint=20
equivalences. Now, to any involutive category (E,(-)^*) is naturally=20
associated a dagger category, which I shall call the *dagger core* of=20
(E,(-)^*). Namely, the objects of the dagger core are pairs (A,\phi_A)=20
consisting of an object A of E together with an isomorphism=20
\phi_A:A->A^* which is invariant under the self-adjunction (i.e.=20
phi_A=3D(phi_A)^*i_A). The morphisms f: (A,\phi_A)->(B,\phi_B) are simply=
=20
the morphisms A->B in E. The dagger operation on the dagger core is=20
given by f^{dagger}=3Dphi_A^{-1}f^*\phi_B.

Equivalent involutive categories have dagger-equivalent dagger-cores.=20
What I am trying to say is that involutive categories are "large"=20
objects (in Bob Par=E9's terminology) giving rise (among others) to=20
"small'' objects such as dagger categories (in which it isn't "evil" to=20
speak about "equality" of objects).

In order to get the dagger-category of Hilbert spaces and continuous=20
maps, one has to start with the involutive category of Banach spaces and=20
continuous (i.e. bounded) maps. Over the reals, the involution is given=20
by the continuous dual; over the complex numbers however, the involution=20
is given by homming into C equipped with the complex-conjugate C-action.

Let me briefly discuss two possible strengthenings of the notion of=20
involutive category (relevant to quantum algebra). Call a category E=20
*closed involutive* if  E is at once closed monoidal and involutive in=20
such a way that the involution (-)^*:E->E^{op} is given by homming into=20
the unit of the monoidal structure. Define the *core *of a closed=20
involutive category to be the full subcategory spanned by the dualizable=20
objects A (i.e. those for which i_A:A->A^** is an isomorphism). Then the=20
core is again closed involutive, and is actually a pivotal category.=20
Indeed, pivotal categories are precisely closed involutive categories in=20
which all objects are dualizable. I guess that most of the pivotal=20
categories occuring in nature are cores of "large" closed involutive=20
categories. This is at least the case when Tannaka-reconstruction applies=
.

Finally, call a category E *star-involutive* if E is at once closed=20
monoidal and involutive in such a way that the involution is given by=20
homming into a "dualising" object D. The only thing we require is that=20
i_D:D->D^** be an isomorphism. Then the core of a star-involutive=20
category (spanned by the dualizable objects) is again star-involutive.

In analogy with above, a star-involutive category in which all objects=20
are dualizable, could be called *star-pivotal*; star-pivotal categories=20
bear the same relationship to pivotal categories as Michael Barr's=20
star-autonomous categories bear to autonomous categories.

All the best,
                    Clemens.
