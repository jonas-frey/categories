Since "nauseous" means "causing nausea", perhaps Thurston's remark
had just sickened the audience.

Now here is someone well-attuned to these subtleties of English!

I've always been delighted by opposite categories.  Sometimes I think
we live in one.  For example: if you flip forward in a book you
eventually reach the back, but if you go back far enough you reach
the foreword... and in the ancient past everything was younger.

I always tell my students that since category theory reduces all of
mathematics
to the study of arrows, and the only mistake you can make with an arrow is
to get confused about which way it's pointing, they should expect to spend
many hours confused about exactly this.

Best,
jb
