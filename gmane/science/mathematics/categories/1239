>From the Introduction:
As friends, colleagues, and students of Jim's for many years, we are
pleased to be able to present to him this collection of papers, whose
span covers much (unfortunately not all) of the territory Jim's own work
has influenced so profoundly. We join the authors of these papers in
wishing him well, and hoping to derive further inspiration from his
research for many years to come.
The Editors: M. Barr, P.J. Scott, R.A.G. Seely
