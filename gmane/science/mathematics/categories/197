Categorical,

i have a question about a presentation of sets. The motivation for this
question comes from a conversation i had a few years ago with Jamie Gabbay
concerning the use of FM-set theory in semantics for 'freshness'. i was
arguing that a certain use of 'reflection' gave a canonical (and smallest)
set of atoms. Jamie objected that atoms are not allowed to have internal
structure in FM-set theory. My question has to do with my response.

Because my question has to do with a formulation in categorical language,
rather than formulate it in that language, i will formulate it naively. In
my view, heavily influenced by computing as it is, i see the basics of set
theory as providing some operations for constructing and inspecting,
de-structing a data type called set. Very primitively, we have operations
for

   - extensionally constructing sets, '{ ... }' and
   - operations for intensionally constructing sets '{ ... | ... }'
   - operations for inspecting sets 'x in ... '

In this view, nothing prevents me from imagining two different versions of
this data type. One of which i will call the 'black' version and one of
which i will call the 'red' version. Initially, i might imagine these data
types as copies of each other; but, we can only construct and inspect 'black
sets' with 'black' braces and 'black' in predicate; and likewise for the
'red sets'. So, never the twain shall meet.

Now, once we've built such a structure, there's nothing to prevent us from
imaginging that the 'atoms' of a 'black' FM-set theory are none other than
'red sets'. Symmetrically, nothing prevents us from imagining that the
'atoms' of a 'red' FM-set theory are none other than 'black sets'. A
suggestive use of data type specifications might illustrate the idea

   - Ordinary sets
      - Set ::= '{' Set* '}'
      - Red/black sets
      - BlackSet ::= '{b|' (BlackSet + RedAtom)* '|b}'
      - RedSet ::= '{r|' (RedSet + BlackAtom)* '|r}'
      - RedAtom ::= RedSet
      - BlackAtom ::= BlackSet

Now, my question: is there a topos theoretic characterization of the obvious
zoology that results from these musings?

Best wishes,

--greg
