If you wish to attend the QICS school PLEASE REGISTER.  Places are =20
limited!

The QICS Spring School consists of extended tutorials on:
* Structures and methods for measurement-based quantum computation
* Categorical semantics, logics, diagrammatic methods
* Classical-quantum interaction and information flow
* Quantum automata, machines, calculi

Topics that will be covered include:
* measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC); properties of graph =20
states; MBQC and condensed matter physics; blind quantum computation; =20=

determinism in MBQC; measurement-based classical computation and non-=20
locality;
* monoidal categories, Frobenius algebras, and their graphical =20
calculus; (co)algebra of complementary observables and multipartite =20
quantum entanglement, and applications to MBQC; phase groups and non-=20
locality;
* classical simulation of quantum circuits; categorical topological =20
quantum computation; graphical calculus for measurements and channels; =20=

generalized probabilistic theories; convex operational models and non-=20=

locality;
* quantum cellular automata (QCA); QCAs and causality; higher types in =20=

quantum computing; quantum logics and quantum machines; colagebraic =20
methods;

Confirmed lecturers:
Samson Abramsky (Oxford), Pablo Arrighi (Grenoble), Howard Barnum =20
(Perimeter), Jonathan Barrett (Bristol, TBC), Dan Browne (UCL - =20
London), Bob Coecke (Oxford), Ross Duncan (Oxford), Bill Edwards =20

The QICS Spring immediately precedes the Quantum Physics and Logic =20
workshop, happening at the same location.  =

FEES and SUPPORT:
For students there will be no registration fees;  for others we ask =20
that you bring =A335 in cash toward the costs of food and drink at the =20=

school.

We will provide free youth hostel accommodation for a limited number =20
of students.  Please email ross.duncan@comlab.ox.ac.uk as soon as =20
possible if you would like to take advantage of this.  Places will be =20=

allocated on a first come first served basis.

TO REGISTER:
Email ross.duncan@comlab.ox.ac.uk.  Please indicate whether or not you =20=

are a student, and whether you will also attend the QPL workshop.
