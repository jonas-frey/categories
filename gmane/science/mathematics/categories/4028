Since all of January is a peak time for tourism in Cape Town, it is urgen=

independently through Internet of course. However, the following addition=
al
information should be helpful: We recommend that participants book either

1. All Africa House http://www.cal.uct.ac.za/ . This is very nice and
reasonable accommodation on the campus within 10 mins walking distance of
the conference venue. They are reserving  20 rooms for us until the end o=
f
October. Please contact Callie at prezandt@protem.uct.ac.za (Web:
www.cal.uct.ac.za ) to make a reservation and mention that you are a
participant in the Max Kelley Conference.

2. Alternatively, if you prefer to stay in the City, we recommend the
Victoria and Alfred Waterfront http://www.waterfront.co.za/ which has a
number of hotels (some quite expensive) in particular the Breakwater Lodg=
e
Hotel. In fact we have made an agreement with the Breakwater Lodge Hotel;
they are retaining some rooms for conference participants at a (mildly)
reduced rate. If you wish to reserve a room there we can provide you with=
 a
reference to include in your application for a reservation. The Waterfron=
t
is very attractive and a prime tourist destination with many good
restaurants and shops and is situated in the working harbour about 15
minutes by car from UCT.

If you prefer a hotel or B&B near UCT then you can make your own
arrangements by consulting the web page
http://www.mth.uct.ac.za/sams/accomodation.html which summarises options.
(This page was constructed for another conference which is being hosted b=
y

options mentioned above. Note that if you are staying for an additional w=
eek
then you may choose to change accommodation in the second week to suit yo=
ur
purpose.
