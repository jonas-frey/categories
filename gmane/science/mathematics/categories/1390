I am afraid it has not.

In my opinion, it should be called 'semi-simplicial object', consistently
with the original terminology in Eilenberg-Zilber (see references below).
Such a term has been adopted in Weibel's text on homological algebra
(1994). But there seems to be some opposition.

I hope the following reconstruction of terminology is correct.

1. What is now called a simplicial object was introduced by Eilenberg and
Zilber (1950); they use:

(a) [already existing] 'simplicial complex' = set with distinguished parts;
(b) [new term] 'semi-simplicial complex' = graded set with faces;
(c) [new term] 'complete s.s. complex' = graded set with faces and degeneracies;

2. Later, notion (c) was recognised as more important than (b) and called
'semi-simplicial complex', leaving (b) without any standard name.

3. Since May's book (1967) at least, notion (c) gradually settled down as
'simplicial set', generalised to 'simplicial object' in a category; this is
now standard.

4. It should now be natural to use a similar term, 'semi-simplicial object
(possibly: set)' for (b), i.e. a 'simplicial object without degeneracies'
(as in Weibel 1994). This is consistent with the original use in
Eilenberg-Zilber and gives a non-ambiguous set of terms for the three
notions recalled:

(a) 'simplicial complex' (also: combinatorial complex)
(b) 'semi-simplicial object (set)'
(c) 'simplicial object (set)'

However, I used myself this terminology in a paper published in '97 and had
strong reactions from people attached to the terminology in use between
50's and '60s (point 2 above).
