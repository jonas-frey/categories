============================================================

91st Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic

November 27-28, 2010

Amsterdam, The Netherlands

http://staff.science.uva.nl/~ciancia/PSSL91/

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION------CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

=============================================================

Dear All,

The registration for the 91st Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and
Logic is now open.

To register please visit the web site and fill the registration form.
Please REGISTER BEFORE 10th of November 2010


The seminar will be held on the weekend of 27th-28th November 2010 in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  The conference venue is located in the
heart of Amsterdam, University library (Single 452, 1.5km from
central station)


The web site contains practical information on traveling and
accommodation. You can also find a map with relevant locations for
the conference.


Everybody is encouraged to give a talk. If you want to speak please
specify this in the registration form. We will fit as many talks as
time allows.


Accommodation:

Amsterdam is a very touristy city. This means that there are plenty
of offers for accommodation and very often you can benefit from
"Weekend Escape Deals". Unfortunately, such popularity makes it
difficult for us to prebook rooms.

The University of Amsterdam has deals with several hotels, see the
web site, and they offer a small discount for participants of PSSL91.
Please contact the hotels directly and mention that you are attending
PSSL91 organized by the ILLC.

A solution to reduce costs is to share. Many hotels will offer you
the same rate (or an infinitesimal difference) for one or two persons.


Hotel Asterisk (Den Texstraat 16) has prebooked some rooms for us.
75 euros per night single room with private facilities.
50 euros per night single room shared facilities.
To benefit from these offers contact the Hotel before 1st of November
and mention PSSL91.


Conference Dinner

On Saturday the 27th there will be a workshop dinner. All attendees
are invited for the dinner, which will be free for speakers.
Depending on the number of guests we will partially sponsor the cost
for registered participants.


Looking forward to see you in Amsterdam!!!


Best Regards,

Raul Leal
