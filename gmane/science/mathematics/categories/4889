Toby, et al,

Unfortunately, the patent game is more subtle than 'is it really new' on
adjudication. To the best of my understanding, the adjudication process over
a disputed claim really has a lot more to do with the depth of the pockets
of the parties involved in the dispute. Discovery and argumentation can
often be drawn out in a manner that those not quite resourced to see through
to the end of the process simply get buried. The organizations and entities
engaged in the IP-game are fully aware of this aspect of the whole
arrangement. While i'm of mixed feelings regarding the overall issue of
intellectual property, the actual motivations and carryings on of those who
do engage in this really are often quite deplorable.

Best wishes,

--greg
