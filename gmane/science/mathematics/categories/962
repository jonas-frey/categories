A few remarks: In the case where V is an abelian group, the first
axiom already implies the other two if we define [a] = -[a,a,a].
Namely, by letting a=b in the first axiom, it follows that [a,a,c] is
independent of c.

If V is an abelian group, then one can get an example of the above
structure from an arbitrary map {-,-} : A x A ---> V by letting
[a,b,c] = {a,b}+{b,c}-{a,c} and [a] = -{a,a}. Tom's "area" example is
of this form.

In fact, if V is an abelian group, then *any* example of a V-enriched
category is (non-uniquely) of the form described in the previous
paragraph: Fix some x in A (if any), and define {a,b} = [a,b,x].

What about the non-group case? In general, [a,b,c] need not always be
invertible in V. In fact, [a,b,a] need not be invertible. For a simple
example of this, let V be the natural numbers and define

 [a]     = 0,
 [a,b,c] = 0, if a=b or b=c,
           1, if a,b,c pairwise distinct,
           2, otherwise (i.e., if a=c but a,b distinct).

This indeed works. 

Best wishes,
