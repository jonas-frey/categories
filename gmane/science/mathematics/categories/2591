Dear Categorists -

Sorry to take a while to respond.  People at UCR have been unable to
receive posts on the category theory mailing list, due to problems with
our internet connection.

I'd asked for some nice examples of an object G in a rig category
equipped with an isomorphism from G to G^2 + 1.  Steve Schanuel replied:

>I was unable to understand John Baez' golden object problem, nor his
>description of the solutions.  He refuses to tell us what 'nice' means, [...]

The problem was deliberately open-ended, but you seem to have
understood it perfectly, since you've given a nice solution,
including a precise specification of what you consider "nice".

Let me repeat the two solutions given by Robin Houston:

1) The first solution works in any rig category having an object H
equipped with an isomorphism to H^2 + 4H + 1.  The solution is to take

G = H + 2.

I described how Houston uses the isomorphism H -> H^2 + 4H + 1 to
construct an isomorphism G^2 -> G + 1.

What's nice about this is that it reduces a problem that's not
obviously of fixed-point form to one that is.

2) Houston's second solution works in any monoidal cocomplete category,
tensor product distributing over colimits, that contains an object X
equipped with an isomorphism to 2X + 1.  The solution is to let G be
the object of "binary planar rooted trees with X-labelled leaves", i.e.

G = X + X^2 + 2X^3 + 5X^4 + 14X^5 + 42X^6 + ...

where the coefficients are Catalan numbers.  He uses the obvious
isomorphism G -> G^2 + X to construct an isomorphism G^2 -> G + 1.

What's nice about this is that it shows Propp's originally proposed
golden object really is one: just take the category of sigma-polytopes
with its cartesian product, and let X be the open interval!  And,
it makes precise the sense in which the alternating sum of Catalan
numbers equals the golden ratio.

Steve writes:

I think example 1) does the job if we take the free distributive
category on an object H equipped with an isomorphism to H^2 + 4H + 1.
Right?

Steve also writes:

>He is very generous, allowing one to use a category with both plus
>and times as extra monoidal structures.  (Does anyone know an example

It's unnecessary, but handy: I think there's also an golden object in
the rig category of reps of quantum SU(2) at a suitable value of q.
Here the tensor product is not cartesian.

In the lingo of quantum group theory, this object has "quantum dimension"
equal to the golden number.  It's interesting how such nonintegral but
algebraic "dimensions" show up naturally in quantum group theory,
just as nonintegral but algebraic "cardinalities" show up in the theory
of distributive categories.

I don't know any golden objects in rig categories where the plus is
not coproduct, and I agree that such rig categories arise less often
than those where times is not product.  But, if you use the obvious
way of making the groupoid of finite sets into a rig category, + isn't
coproduct, nor is x product.

You're right: categorification is not a systematic process!
I explained this idea back in "week121", and also in my paper
"Categorification", at http://www.arXiv.org/abs/math.QA/9802029.
Here's what I said.

 If one studies categorification one soon discovers an amazing fact: many
 deep-sounding results in mathematics are just categorifications of facts
 we learned in high school!  There is a good reason for this.  All along,
 we have been unwittingly `decategorifying' mathematics by pretending
 that categories are just sets.  We `decategorify' a category by
 forgetting about the morphisms and pretending that isomorphic objects
 are equal.  We are left with a mere set: the set of isomorphism classes
 of objects.

 To understand this, the following parable may be useful.  Long ago, when
 shepherds wanted to see if two herds of sheep were isomorphic, they
 would look for an explicit isomorphism.  In other words, they would line
 up both herds and try to match each sheep in one herd with a sheep in
 the other.  But one day, along came a shepherd who invented
 decategorification.  She realized one could take each herd and `count'
 it, setting up an isomorphism between it and some set of `numbers',
 which were nonsense words like `one, two, three, ...' specially
 designed for this purpose.  By comparing the resulting numbers, she
 could show that two herds were isomorphic without explicitly
 establishing an isomorphism!  In short, by decategorifying the category
 of finite sets, the set of natural numbers was invented.

 According to this parable, decategorification started out as a stroke
 of mathematical genius.  Only later did it become a matter of dumb
 habit, which we are now struggling to overcome by means of
 categorification.  While the historical reality is far more
 complicated, categorification really has led to tremendous progress
 in mathematics during the 20th century.  For example, Noether
 revolutionized algebraic topology by emphasizing the importance of
 homology groups.  Previous work had focused on Betti numbers, which
 are just the dimensions of the rational homology groups.  As with
 taking the cardinality of a set, taking the dimension of a vector
 space is a process of decategorification, since two vector spaces are
 isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.  Noether noted
 that if we work with homology groups rather than Betti numbers, we can
 solve more problems, because we obtain invariants not only of spaces,
 but also of maps.

 In modern language, the nth rational homology is a *functor* defined
 on the *category* of topological spaces, while the nth Betti number is
 a mere *function*, defined on the *set* of isomorphism classes of
 topological spaces.  Of course, this way of stating Noether's insight
 is anachronistic, since it came before category theory.  Indeed, it
 was in Eilenberg and Mac Lane's subsequent work on homology that
 category theory was born!

 Decategorification is a straightforward process which typically
 destroys information about the situation at hand.  Categorification,
 being an attempt to recover this lost information, is inevitably
 fraught with difficulties.

I hope it's clearer now.

Best,
