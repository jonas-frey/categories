                      4th WORKSHOP ON HYBRID LOGICS

                      LICS 2002 Affiliated Workshop
                          >>> JULY 25, 2002 <<<
                           Copenhagen, Denmark

                          FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS


 THEME:

 Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic in which it is possible to
 directly refer to worlds/times/states or whatever the elements of the
 (Kripke) model are meant to represent. Although they date back to the
 late 1960s, and have been sporadically investigated ever since, it is
 only in the 1990s that work on them really got into its stride.

 It is easy to justify interest in hybrid logic on applied grounds,
 with the usefulness of the additional expressive power. For example,
 when reasoning about time one often wants to build up a series of
 assertions about what happens at a particular instant, and standard
 modal formalisms do not allow this. What is less obvious is that the
 route hybrid logic takes to overcome this problem (the basic
 mechanism being to add nominals --- atomic symbols true at a unique
 point --- together with extra modalities to exploit them) often
 actually improves the behavior of the underlying modal formalism. For
 example, it becomes far simpler to formulate modal tableau and
 resolution in hybrid logic, and completeness and interpolation
 results can be proved of a generality that is simply not available in
 modal logic. That is, hybridization --- adding nominals and related
 apparatus --- seems a fairly reliable way of curing many known
 weaknesses in modal logic. For more general background on hybrid
 logic, and many of the key papers, see the Hybrid Logics homepage:

                      http://www.hylo.net

 HyLo@LICS is likely to be relevant to a wide range of people,
 including those interested in description logic, feature logic,
 applied modal logics, temporal logic, and labelled deduction.
 Moreover, if you have an interest in the work of the late Arthur
 Prior, note that this workshop is devoted to exploring ideas he first
 introduced 30 years ago --- it will be an ideal opportunity to see
 how his ideas have been developed in the intervening period.

 In this workshop we hope to bring together researchers from all the
 different fields just mentioned (and hopefully some others) in an
 attempt to explore what they all have (and do not have) in common. If
 you're unsure whether your work is of relevance to the workshop,
 please check out the Hybrid Logics homepage. And do not hesitate to
 contact the workshop organisers for more information. We'd be
 delighted to tell you more. Contact details are give below.

 SUBMISSIONS:

 We invite the contribution of research papers to the workshop. Please
 send electronically an extended abstract of up to 10 A4 size pages,
 in PostScript format to: carlos@science.uva.nl BEFORE the 26st of
