The 21st International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and
Applications (RTA 2010) is organized as part of the Federated Logic
Conference (FLOC 2010), together with the International Joint Conference
on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR 2010), the Conference on Automated
Verification (CAV 2010), the IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science
(LICS 2010), the International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP
2010), the Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability
Testing (SAT 2010), the Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP
2010) and many workshops.  FLOC 2010 will be held at the University of
Edinburgh.

IMPORTANT DATES:

Abstract Submission:  January 15, 2010

Paper Submission:     January 22, 2010

Notification:         March 8, 2010

Final version:        April 3, 2010

RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects
of rewriting. Typical areas of interest
include (but are not limited to):

 * Applications: case studies; analysis of cryptographic protocols;
   rule-based (functional and logic) programming; symbolic and algebraic
   computation; theorem proving; system synthesis and verification;
proof
   checking; reasoning about programming languages and logics; program
   transformation;

 * Foundations: matching and unification; narrowing; completion
techniques;
   strategies; rewriting calculi, constraint solving; tree automata;
   termination; complexity; combination;

 * Frameworks: string, term, and graph rewriting; lambda-calculus and
   higher-order rewriting; constrained rewriting/deduction; categorical
and
   infinitary rewriting; integration of decision procedures; net
rewriting;
   binding techniques;

 * Implementation: implementation techniques; parallel execution;
rewrite
   tools; termination checking; abstract machines; explicit
substitutions;

 * Semantics: equational logic; rewriting logic; rewriting models of
   programs.

INVITED SPEAKERS:
Georg Gottlob (Oxford, UK) and J. Strother Moore (Austin, USA) will be
keynote speakers for the RTA block at FLOC.  Mikolaj Bojanczyk (Warsaw,
Poland) and Vincent van Oostrom (Utrecht, Netherlands) will be invited
speakers at RTA.

BEST PAPER AWARD:
A prize of 500 Euro will be given to the best paper as judged by the
program committee. The program committee may decline to make the award
or may split it among several papers.

CONFERENCE CHAIR:
 * Fairouz Kamereddine (Edinburgh, UK)

PUBLICATION:
RTA proceedings will be published by LIPIcs (Leibniz International
Proceedings in Informatics).  LIPIcs is open
access, meaning that publications will be available online and free of
charge, and authors keep the copyright for their papers.  LIPIcs
publications are indexed in DBLP.  STACS and FSTTCS proceedings also
appear in LIPIcs.  See

http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics for more information about
LIPIcs.

SUBMISSIONS:
Submissions must be original and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Submissions must fall into one of the
following categories (to be indicated at submission):

1. Regular research Papers: describing new results; they will be judged
   on correctness and significance.

2. Papers describing the experience of applying rewriting techniques in
   other areas; they will be judged on relevance and comparison with
   other approaches.

3. Problem sets that provide realistic and interesting challenges in
   the field of rewriting.

4. System descriptions; they should contain a link to a working system
   and will be judged on usefulness and design.

All submissions will be judged on originality and quality of
presentation. Submissions in the first three categories can be up to 15
proceedings pages long, system descriptions up to 10 proceedings pages.
Additional material, for instance proof details, may be given in an
appendix which is not subject to the page limit.
However, submissions must be self-contained within the respective page
limit; reading the appendix should not be
necessary to assess the merits of a submission.

Submissions are accepted in either Postscript or PDF format.

Abstracts and papers must be submitted electronically through the
EasyChair system at:

  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rta2010

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:
Submitted works are limited to 15 pages, including references, and must
use the LaTeX class lipics-rta.cls,
available for download below.

An appendix, at the end of an article, may be included for the purpose
of review but will not be included in the
text published in the proceedings. An appendix, if included, may or may
not be considered by the referees, at their discretion.
