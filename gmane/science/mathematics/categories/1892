LAST CALL FOR PAPERS
FORMAL STRUCTURES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

Organized by Y. Velinov, University of Natal

-------------------------

TOPICS OF THE INVITED SESSION:

A rich variety of formal models are currently in use in 
every field of the contemporary information technology. 
New formal structures are frequently introduced to model 
real world situations. Old, sometimes almost forgotten, 
are revived finding new applications.
The aim of the present session is, 
instead of concentrating on a particular approach, 
to get together researchers from different areas 
to share ideas, approaches and their practical efficiency.

The scope of the session includes set-theoretical, 
relational, logical or categorical structures. 
More specific areas like Petri nets or Automata theory 
are also welcome.


SUBMISSION  
------------
Potential authors are asked to inform for their intention 
to submit a paper as soon as possible by sending a short 
abstract to  yuri@cs.unp.ac.za.

Potential authors are expected to send the draft of their paper 
for reviewing before 12 April 2001 in PS (possibly zipped) 
or PDF format to yuri@cs.unp.ac.za.

Instructions for preparing a paper for the session 
can be found at the conference site.

The invited sessions will be published by IIIS
(International Institute of Informatics and Systemics)
as books with multiple authors.
