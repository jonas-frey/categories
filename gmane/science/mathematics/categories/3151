Dear Mike,

Looking into the MathSciNet, I see that:

Mackey's 1942 thesis was published in abbreviated form in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 29 (1943). The Math Reviews
reviewer seems to clearly understand that part of idea was to replace open
sets with linear functionals.

The extended publication in the Transactions was in vol. 57 (1945) whereas
the publication of Eilenberg and Mac Lane's famous paper was in vol. 58.
In the same volume 58 there is a paper by Clifford Truesdell.

Best, Bill
