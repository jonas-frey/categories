This result is a special case of a general fact about adjunctions,
which appears (yes, really!) as Lemma A1.1.1 in the Elephant.
I don't claim any originality for it, but I did comment in the
text that it "seems not to be widely known".

Lemma: Let F: C --> D be a functor having a right adjoint G.
If there is any natural isomorphism between the composite FG and
the identity functor on D, then the counit of the adjunction is
an isomorphism.

Proof: One can transport the comonad structure on FG across the
isomorphism, to obtain a comonad structure on 1_D. But the monoid
of natural endomorphisms of the identity functor on any category
is commutative, so the counit and comultiplication of this comonad
must be inverse isomorphisms. Transporting back again, the counit
of (F -| G) is an isomorphism.
