Summer School in Algebra and Topology (second announcement)


Dear colleagues,

As previously announced, the Summer School in Algebra and Topology will =
take place at the Universite catholique de Louvain from Wednesday 12 to =
Saturday 15 September 2018 ( see www.uclouvain.be/irmp-summerschool for =
more information).

The invited speakers of the Summer School will be professors Maria =
Manuel Clementino (University of Coimbra), Alberto Facchini (University =
of Padova) and Tim Van der Linden (Universite catholique de Louvain).=20

The Summer School will consist of three intensive courses addressed to =
Master and PhD students, that will be of interest also for more =
experienced researchers in mathematics. This event is part of a joint =
project of the Universit=C3=A9 catholique de Louvain with the =
universities of Coimbra, Padova and Poitiers, promoting research =
collaboration within the Coimbra Group.=20

The programme will be the following:=20

Topological algebras - Maria Manuel Clementino=20

Commutative monoids, noncommutative rings and modules - Alberto Facchini=20=


Non-associative algebras - Tim Van der Linden=20

There is limited funding available to partially cover local expenses for =
students. To apply for this funding, the applicant should send me an =
updated CV and a reference letter by May 1st, 2018.

In order to register it suffices to send an email to Mme Carine Baras ( =
carine.baras@uclouvain.be ) by June 15, 2018, mentioning the academic =
status (Master or PhD student, post-doc, professor, etc.).

With best regards,=20

Marino Gran
