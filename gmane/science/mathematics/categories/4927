I think the reason for the silence is that category theory is a bit
different than other branches of mathematics.  Other branches of mathematics
get very excited about patterns that may exist, but may not.  So when
mathematicians hear the phrase "famous unsolved problems", that's the sort
of thing that comes to mind: for example, Goldbach's conjecture, the twin
prime conjecture, the Riemann hypothesis or the Hodge conjecture.

On the other hand, category theorists tend to get excited about taking
already partially understood patterns in mathematics and making them very
clear.   So, the most important open problems often aren't  of the form "Is
this statement true or false?"  Instead, they tend to be a bit more
open-ended, like "Develop a workable theory of n-categories."  So, they
don't have names.

I've tried to encourage people to work on n-categories by emphasizing five
"hypotheses": the homotopy hypothesis, the stabilization hypothesis, the
cobordism hypothesis, the tangle hypothesis, and the generalized tangle
hypothesis.  I didn't want to call them "conjectures", because they're a bit
open-ended.  But they're precise enough that someone can claim to have
proved one, and people can probably agree on whether this has occurred.  For
example, Jacob Lurie claims to have proved the cobordism hypothesis:

http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0465

http://lab54.ma.utexas.edu:8080/video/lurie.html

and when he provides the full details, people should be able to decide if he
has.

Best,
