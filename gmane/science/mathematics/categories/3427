This announces the release of Easik, a Java application providing a
graphical design environment for Entity-Attribute (EA) sketches.  These
sketches are the syntactic basis for the categorical Sketch Data Model
(SkDM) which extends and enhances the standard Entity-Relationship-Attribute
data model.

For extensive information about the Sketch Data Model consult the web
sites of the poster and Michael Johnson.

Complementing its graphical interface, Easik can save an EA sketch
design into an XML document which is exportable to a database schema in
SQL. The schema includes triggers and procedures to enforce the
constraints defined graphically. Easik provides connectivity to common
database management systems via JDBC.

The application is available for download at

http://mathcs.mta.ca/research/rosebrugh/Easik

or follow links from

http://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/

Instructions for using Easik are are on the Web pages:
- users may download a Java archive (jar file) providing the application and
- source code is available.

Easik was developed by Robert Fletcher, Kevin Green, Vera Ranieri and
Robert Rosebrugh with support from NSERC Canada and Mount Allison
University.

We are interested comments from users, and would also appreciate receiving
reports of difficulties with function or usability.
