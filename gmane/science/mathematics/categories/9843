I don't know if the cat list ever posted anything about John Gray's death. =
  Here is something a friend in Urbana sent me when I asked about John (whom=
  I hadn't heard from in years and wondered about) written by one of his son=
s.  If you think it appropriate, you could send to the list.

John Gray

URBANA - John Walker Gray died May 17, 2017, at age 85. It was not unexpect=
ed.

He died as he lived, in a comfortable and well-planned manner, his needs an=
ticipated, and care taken that his affairs be in order. He was there for my=
  first breath, and I was there for his last, as is good and right. His fore=
sight gave him, at the end of his time, an interval of rest and contentment=
  that all deserve, but few are afforded.

Born to a merchant, he imagined for himself a life of the mind. Through har=
d work and patient dedication, he made that a reality, becoming an erudite =
and well-traveled man, a talented pianist and a mathematician of note in se=
veral fields. The arc of his life was a work of his own devising, and it wa=
s good.

John went from an undergraduate degree from Swarthmore College in 1953 to h=
is doctorate from Stanford University in 1957 as a student of the renowned =
Charles Loewner. His doctoral thesis on contact structures, published in th=
e Annals of Mathematics, remains of interest today, having been cited nearl=
y a hundred times in recent years alone.

As a professor of mathematics at the University of Illinois, John supervise=
d five Ph.D. students and at the end of his career served as director of gr=
aduate studies. His research interests centered on category yheory, a study=
  of patterns common to many parts of mathematics including algebra, topolog=
y, logic and computer science. His 1974 book on formal category theory has =
long been a standard reference. John contributed to categorical semantics o=
f programming languages, including versions of the lambda calculus, and he =
attracted several of the founders and early employees of Wolfram Research t=
o Urbana. He made his mark, advanced the art, and his students take a part =
of him into the future.

John was preceded in death by his wife of many years, Eva Wirth Gray, who i=
ntroduced him to Switzerland where he spent happy sabbatical years and wher=
e his only daughter, Elizabeth, died at age 15. Of his siblings, Corinne, S=
uzanne and Nancy, only the last survives him, as do his nephews Allen, Tom =
and Kayvon. Yiling, Laur and Tony preceded him in death. Of his own, he is =
survived by his sons, Stephen and Theodore; and three grandchildren, Addie,=
  Emma and Connor. He is also survived by all but one of a dedicated group o=
f caregivers who became his second family late in life. To this family - Br=
ittany, Mary, Jan, Ashley and the tragically departed Tiffany - his first f=
amily extends their most heartfelt thanks for the love and care he received=
  right up until the last moment of his life.

John Walker Gray executed the story of his life well and completed it with =
grace. He will be missed by all who knew him.
