My self-published advanced undergraduate algebra  text
"Introductory Algebra, Topology, and Category Theory"
has been  available by mail order since mid-2006.  Recently I have made
it  available at "_www.amazon.com_ (http://www.amazon.com) ".  Also,  it has
received a favorable
review from the MAA online reviews ("_www.maa.org/reviews_
(http://www.maa.org/reviews) ").

This text is currently the only one available which covers such a
wide  range of material in a single volume.  It is ideally suited for a
number  of uses, including as a supplementary text for any undergraduate
algebra  course.  The MAA review recommends it as a second text in
algebra for  students interested in mathematics.

The table of contents and first chapter may be viewed at
"_www.hyperonsoft.com_ (http://www.hyperonsoft.com) ".
