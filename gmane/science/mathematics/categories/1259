           Post-Doctoral Research Associate (Ref: R9112/GD)

Applications are invited for the post of Research Associate to work on
a project funded by the EPSRC to develop Mechanized Operational
Semantics.  Applicants should have (or expect soon to have) a
Ph.D. which includes experience in either programming language
semantics or machine assisted proof. Knowledge of both areas would be
an advantage. The project will involve the coding of operational
semantics within a theorem prover such as Isabelle or HOL, and will
lead to verifications of compiler optimizations. The position is
available from January 2000 for up to three years. Salary will be on
the R&A1A scale 16,286 to 24,479 GBP pa. Further details can be
found at http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk/jobs
