I have for the  most part been acknowledging corrections as they come in,
but just take it as given that I welcome all corrections and they will
appear in the next iteration.  So far, corrected things have appeared
every day, but I will likely stop that after today.

After some discussion with Marcia, we have accepted Colin's suggestion
(thanks also to Jean-Pierre) and the new title will appear shortly.

Michael
