Dear Andre,
An addendum to my previous is in order. In Section 7 of Bunge-Hermida =20=

we actually discuss Lack's model structure on 2-Cat(S). We did this =20
only to show that it is not suitable to get 2-stack completions, in =20
case someone would think of this idea. The (ELP) is too restrictive =20
for that. This may have led to your misunderstanding when we actually =20=

agree. What we wanted (though we did not need it) was a model =20
structure similar to the Joyal-Terney but in dimension 2, and of =20
course it would be different from this one. I am sure too that it =20
exists.
Best,Marta
