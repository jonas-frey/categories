Supplementing Peter's answer to Streicher's K-finiteness question,
I recall Prop. 7.4 on p. 97 of SLNM #753, which states, for presheaf topoi
E = (C^op, Sets), that, with  E_Kf  the full subcategory of K-finite E-objects:
 
E_Kf  is balanced
iff
it's a topos
iff
each K-finite is decidable
iff
C is a "2-way" category
iff
... .

Streicher's >--> sure isn't 2-way, hence ... .

The rest of that 20 year old report on my student Acun~a's thesis with me
is also fun.
