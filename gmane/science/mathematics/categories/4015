Dear Paul,

In the following (private) response to Vaughan, I cleared up a couple of
points from my previous posting. I reproduce it here publicly since those
points may be relevant to some of the things you wrote. But I really have
nothing else to say (at the moment) so no need to reply.

Best regards,
Marta
