CiE 2015:  Call for Participation and Registration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPUTABILITY IN EUROPE 2015: Evolving Computability
Bucharest, Romania
June 29 - July 3
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/


IMPORTANT DATES:
EARLY REGISTRATION DEADLINE: May 20, 2015
Details on the registration:
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/registration.html
Details on accommodation possibilities:
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/accommodation.html
(please note the individual deadlines for each variant)

CiE 2015 is the 11-th conference organized by CiE (Computability
in Europe), a European association of mathematicians, logicians,
computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested
in new developments in computability and their underlying
significance for the real world. Previous meetings have taken
place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006), Siena (2007), Athens
(2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponta Delgada (2010), Sofia (2011),
Cambridge (2012), Milan (2013) and Budapest (2014)

Evolution of the universe, and us within it, invite a parallel
evolution in understanding. The CiE agenda - fundamental and
engaged - targets the extracting and developing of computational
models basic to current challenges. From the origins of life, to
the understanding of human mentality, to the characterising of
quantum randomness - computability theoretic questions arise in
many guises. The CiE community, meeting this year for the first
time in Bucharest, carries forward the search for coherence, depth
and new thinking across this rich and vital field of research.

In line with other conferences in this series, CiE 2015 has a broad
scope and provides a forum for the discussion of theoretical and
practical issues in Computability with an emphasis on new paradigms
of computation and the development of their mathematical theory.

We invite everyone who is interested in the topics and program of
CiE 2015 to register for the conference. Details on the program of
the conference are given below. The details regarding the registration
procedure are given at:
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/registration.html


PROGRAM:

The papers accepted for CiE 2015 can be seen here:
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/accepted.html

The CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS will be published by LNCS, Springer
Verlag, and there will be a best student paper award presented to
the best paper written solely by students, sponsored by Springer.

The speakers of the special sessions are listed at
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/sessions.html

INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS:

While computer science conferences usually host formal presentations
based on papers published in a proceedings volume, mathematics
conferences allow for informal presentations that are prepared very
shortly before the conference and inform the participants about
current research and work in progress. So, continuing the tradition
of past CiE conferences, CiE 2015 hosts a series of informal
presentations, in addition to the presentations based on the papers
in the LNCS proceedings volume. These will be soon published on the
CiE 2015 website.

ASSOCIATED WORKSHOPS, JUNE 26-28:

http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/workshops.html

The Turing Centenary Research Project: Mind, Mechanism and
Mathematics (MMM 2015), 3rd Workshop - joint with
Workshop on Computability Theory (WCT 2015),
June 27-28, 2015 (free registration)

Days of Computer Science (DACS 2015), 2nd Workshop,
June 26-27, 2015


STILL AVAILABLE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES:

CiE 2015 has received funding from EATCS (European Association for
Theoretical Computer Science) that allows students who are members
of EATCS and want to attend CiE 2015 to apply for travel funds or a
reduction of the early registration fee. Applications for EATCS
travel grants have to be sent to <cie2015@fmi.unibuc.ro> prior to
the early registration deadline.
