I am pleased to announce the books:

-------------------------------------------------------
     Introduction to Bisimulation and Coinduction
     Davide Sangiorgi
     Cambridge University Press,260pp,ISBN:9781107003637
-------------------------------------------------------
     Advanced Topics in Bisimulation and Coinduction
     Davide Sangiorgi and Jan Rutten (eds)
     Cambridge University Press,340pp,ISBN:9781107004979
-------------------------------------------------------

The first book is an introduction to bisimulation and coinduction and
a precursor to the companion book on more advanced topics.
Throughout the two volumes, a special emphasis is given bisimulation
and processes. This because bisimulation is by far the most studied
coinductive concept, and because bisimulation was discovered in
Concurrency Theory and processes remain the main application area.

Below are blurbs and  tables of contents. For more details,
including order information, see:

INTRODUCTION TO BISIMULATION AND COINDUCTION
=======================================================

BLURB (from the cover page)

Induction is a pervasive tool in computer science and mathematics for
defining objects and reasoning on them. Coinduction is the dual of
induction, and as such it brings in quite different tools. Today, it
is widely used in computer science, but also in other fields,
including artificial intelligence, cognitive science, mathematics,
modal logics, philosophy and physics. The best-known instance of
coinduction is bisimulation, mainly employed to define and prove
equalities among potentially infinite objects: processes, streams,
non-well-founded sets, and so on.

This book presents bisimulation and coinduction: the fundamental concepts
and techniques, and the duality with induction. Each chapter contains
exercises and selected solutions, enabling students to connect theory with
practice. A special emphasis is placed on bisimulation as a behavioural
equivalence for processes. Thus the book serves as an introduction to models
for expressing processes (such as process calculi) and to the associated
techniques of operational and algebraic analysis.

ADVANCED TOPICS IN BISIMULATION AND COINDUCTION
=========================================================

BLURB (from the cover page)


Coinduction is a method for specifying and reasoning about infinite
data types and automata with infinite behaviour. In recent years, it
has come to play an ever more important role in the theory of
computing. It is studied in many disciplines, including process theory
and concurrency, modal logic and automata theory. Typically,
coinductive proofs demonstrate the equivalence of two objects by
constructing a suitable bisimulation relation between them.

This collection of surveys is aimed at both researchers and Master's
students in computer science and mathematics and deals with various
aspects of bisimulation and coinduction, with an emphasis on process
theory.

Seven chapters cover the following topics: history, algebra and
coalgebra, algorithmics, logic, higher-order languages, enhancements
of the bisimulation proof method, and probabilities. Exercises are
also included to help the reader master new material.
