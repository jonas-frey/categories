The Horn formulae quoted by Vaughan can of course be generalized to the
cancellation laws:  xy = xz => y = z  (and similarly on the other side).
In fact the free monoids aren't needed: every free monoid embeds as a
submonoid of a (free) group, and so satisfies all Horn formulae true in
groups. Thus Vaughan is asking for the universal Horn theory of those
monoids which are embeddable in groups. I'm fairly sure that the answer
to this is known, but I can't find a reference for it. In the commutative
case, it's easy to see that the cancellation law is all you need (the
proof is essentially the same as the proof that every integral domain
embeds in a field), but I vaguely remember that in the non-commutative
case you need something more than the cancellation laws.

Generalizing in an obvious way: can one characterize those categories
which admit faithful functors to groupoids by a finite collection of Horn
formulae?
