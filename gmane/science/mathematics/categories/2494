              CATEGORY THEORY AND COMPUTER SCIENCE (CTCS'04)
			  AUGUST 12-14, 2004

                                 AND

		            SUMMER SCHOOL
			  AUGUST 9-11, 2004

		        Copenhagen, Denmark

			FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS


CTCS'04 is the 10th Conference on Category Theory and Computer
Science. The purpose of the conference series is the advancement of
the foundations of computing using the tools of category theory.  The
emphasis is upon applications of category theory, but it is recognized
that the area is highly interdisciplinary.

Typical topics of interest include, but are not limited to,
category-theoretic aspects of the following:

coalgebras and computing
concurrent and distributed systems
constructive mathematics
declarative programming and term rewriting
domain theory and topology
foundations of computer security
linear logic
modal and temporal logics
models of computation
program logics, data refinement, and specification
programming language semantics
type theory

Previous meetings have been held in Guildford (Surrey), Edinburgh (twice),
Manchester, Paris, Amsterdam, Cambridge, S. Margherita Ligure (Genova), and
Ottawa.

The proceedings of the conference will be published as a special issue
of ENTCS (Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science).

Invited Speakers:
	Francois Bergeron
	Martin Hyland
	Robin Milner
	Andrew Pitts
	Thomas Streicher

SUMMER SCHOOL

Inspired by the success of the graduate student preconference of CTCS'02 in
Ottawa, the CTCS of this year will have a similar event: A summer school
from August 9-11. The goal is to prepare students - both graduate and
undergraduate, with basic knowledge of category theory - for CTCS, through
mini-courses in the basic areas underlying some of the fields of the
conference. We anticipate offering courses in among others the following
areas:

Coalgebras
Game Semantics
Categorical Models for Concurrency
Operational Semantics in Concurrency
