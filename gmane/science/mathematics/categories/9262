Hi Jamie,

You said : "Batanin, Leinster and other have presented related definitions
of weak
n-groupoid in terms of contractible globular operads.". I personally find
these definitions of "contractible n-groupoids" extremely beautiful.

To be more precise they gave an operadic approach of weak higher
categories with which we can extract a definition of weak n-groupoids and
can say :
a weak n-groupoid is a specific algebra for the operad K of weak higher
categories (build first by Batanin). However it is important to know that
neither Batanin or Leinster have defined a monad,
specific to higher groupoids,
which algebras are models of globular weak higher groupoids. However this
was done
in my work here :

http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/30/22/30-22.pdf

where in particular I proved that my models of weak higher groupoids are
also
algebras for the operad K of Batanin (which algebras are his definition of
weak
higher categories).

Remark : And with similar methods we can go beyond, and build
cubical and multiple weak higher groupoids, but this is an other story ...
(see
my arxived work ...)

The homotopy hypothesis for these globular weak higher groupoids (those
defined
by Batanin in 1998, or the definition of Grothendieck-Maltsiniotis, or my
approach), seems to be a difficult problem (for that it is good to see the
work of Ara (thesis), Tuy=C3=A9ras (thesis) and Simon Henry), and it is not
evident at all that the homotopy hypothesis is in fact true. However we
suspect it to be true
only based on the fact that Kan-complexes models homotopy of spaces, and
we suspect that there is a Quillen model structure on the category of weak
globular higher groupoids which is Quillen equivalent to the category of
Kan-complexes equipped with the induced model structure on the category of
simplicial sets.

In fact, in=C2=A0http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/30/22/30-22.pdf, I said =
that
we have a generalized
version of the homotopy hypothesis of Grothendieck, which is the statement
that the category of globular weak (infinity,N)-categories (which is the
category of algebras for a fixed monad, for each integer N; and these
algebras are still algebras for the operad K of Batanin !), should be
Quillen equivalent to the category of other simplicial models of
(infinity,N)-categories.

Best,
Camell.
