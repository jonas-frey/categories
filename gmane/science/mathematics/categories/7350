Correction/clarification to previous note: in what follows, the sloppy ph=
rase

> ... the resulting u' is the same as the result of conjugating all the v=
alues
of u by the transposition ...

should be replaced by the more accurate expanded version

> ... the h' (as below) resulting from u' is the same as what Sammy gets =
by
conjugating all the values of the h that arises from u by the transpositi=
on
=2E.. =


Sorry for the sloppy writing. =


Cheers, -- Fred
