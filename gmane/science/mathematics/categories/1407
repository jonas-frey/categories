Yes. Indeed as part of my Ph.D. dissertation I wrote a complete specification
of the interpreter in ASF+SDF, a rewrite rule-based system for algebraic
specifications used at the University of Amsterdam. It can execute programs
of that kind. I can send it to you if you want so. The interpreter is
partially described also in the following papers:

Sebastiano Vigna. Specifying IMP(G) using ASF+SDF: A case study. In Proc. of
the ASF+SDF95 workshop on generating tools from algebraic specifications.
Technical Report P9504 of the University of Amsterdam, 1995.

Sebastiano Vigna. Towards an efficient implementation of distributive
programs. In Proc. of the 2nd International Workshop on the Theory and
Practice of Algebraic Specifications ASF+SDF, Workshops in Comput.
Springer-Verlag, 1998.

Of course (the book is a bit confusing about this issue). Turing completeness
is proved in

Nicoletta Sabadini, Sebastiano Vigna, and Robert F.C. Walters. A note on
recursive functions. Math. Struct. Comp. Sci., 6:127-139, 1996.

and BSS (real numbers computability) completeness is proved in 

Sebastiano Vigna. On the relations between distributive computability and the
BSS model. Theoret. Comput. Sci., 162:5-21, 1996.

Not to my knowledge, but you should ask Bob Walters directly.
