Dear Mike,

Of the results Peter reports in the Elephant, the main one about sheaves
is - as he points out - restricted to point-set spaces.

You may think that's enough, but morally there is a result that is both
simpler and more general and applies also to point-free spaces. It is
somewhat like your original phrasing: if every stalk is a model (of a
given theory T), then the sheaf is an internal T-model in the category
of sheaves. The proof idea is to consider the stalk for the generic
point: this is the sheaf itself, and so is a model.

Of course, the catch is that the generic point is internal in the topos
of sheaves, not in Set. Hence the construction point |-> model has to be
be not only valid in toposes, but also geometric, so that the generic
construction agrees with the specific ones. If "every stalk is a model"
is interpreted in this geometric way, then the result holds and applies
to general geometric theories, not just lex ones. Lex comes in when you
want to make a model out of the set of global sections.

In your example, for a commutative ring R, the points of the co-Zariski
spectrum are described geometrically as the prime ideals of R. In other
words, the topos of sheaves classifies the geometric theory of prime
ideals of R. (We have to be constructively careful here, since for the
Zariski spectrum the points are the prime coideals.) Then the generic
point is an internal prime ideal of the constant sheaf R.

For every prime ideal p we can construct an integral domain R/p, and
this construction is geometric. It constructs not only the sheaf (the
stalks are R/p) but also the stalkwise ID structure. Applying it to the
generic prime ideal of R gives us an ID in the category of sheaves, and
geometricity ensures that it pulls back to the construction in Set for
specific prime ideals. The theory of IDs is not lex, but it is geometric.

I don't know the details of your lex theory, so there is a further
question regarding the construction of models of it out of IDs: is this
construction geometric? If so, then you can carry on working internally
in the topos of sheaves to get a model of the lex theory.

All the best,

Steve.
