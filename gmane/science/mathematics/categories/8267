Dear Paul,

I have received many mails concerning the posting you mentioned and I =
try to answer all of them with precision. This takes a lot of time. I =
shall answer yours, in detail, about the general definition of cartesian =
functors in terms of disdtributors very soon. But the precise answer =
shall be a bit long, so please be patient.=20
All I can say now is that, if P: X --> S is a prefoliation the general =
definition reduces to the simple one I have given (the proof is not =
trivial).
Moreover some of the results of the theorem require the assumption that =
P is a prefoliation. Hardly surprising, if you want to prove stronger =
results you need stronger assumptions. The ones I make are, in a sense, =
minimal. You'll have I think noticed that for 7) I need P to be a =
foliation.

Thanks for your interest. Best regards,

Jean
