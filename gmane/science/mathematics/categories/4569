=3E and considering only small categories would be strange and lacking =

The claim is not that Bourbaki should have studied categories as
structures=2E  It is that Bourbaki was doomed to fail in trying to use
their structure theory=2E  Leo Corry shows in his book =22Modern Algebra =

And they should have seen this coming=2C because their theory had been =
