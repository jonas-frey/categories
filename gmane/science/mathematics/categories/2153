Dear Peter,

I think the relevance of this condition (Sxy defined) is explained in the
Hyland-Ong paper "Modified Realizability Toposes and Strong Normalization
Proofs" (TLCA, LNCS 664, 1993; reference 466 in the Elephant) where they
have a definition of "c-pca" which is just omitting this requirement.
They show that the standard P(A)-indexed preordered set, for a c-pca A,
can fail to be a tripos. So the condition IS used.

Another condition which is often imposed is really redundant: it is the
requirement that, if sxyz defined, then xz(yz) defined and equal to sxyz.
There are important constructions of realizability toposes where this
fails to hold.
