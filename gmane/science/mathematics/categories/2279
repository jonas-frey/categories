Call for Participation
----------------------

We plan the following courses and workshop for graduate students and
researchers.  Like for last year's events on `Proof Theory and
Computation=B4 (Dresden) and `Proof, Computation, Complexity=B4 (Tuebingen),
we aim at a meeting where people have plenty of time to exchange ideas.
The summer school consists of eight advanced courses; the workshop is
integral part of the school and takes place in the last two days.

We ask for a participation fee of 100 EUR. A limited number of grants
covering all expenses is available.  Registration is requested before
May 25, 2003; please send an email to PTEvent@Janeway.Inf.TU-Dresden.DE,
making sure you include a very brief bio (5-10 lines) stating your
experience, interests, home page, etc.  We will select applicants in
case of excessive demand.  We will provide assistance in finding an
accommodation in Dresden.

    Denotational Semantics of Lambda Calculi
    Achim Jung (Birmingham, UK)
