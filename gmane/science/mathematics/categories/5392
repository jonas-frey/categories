Like most fields of mathematics, category theory keeps growing and =
evolving.=20
It may be hard to identify the mechanism of this evolution=20
but fashion must be playing a role.
But why are certain subjects becoming hot at a given time?
Probably because they resonate with new developments outside category =
theory.
When a trend becomes hot, it gives rise to a permanent current.=20
I was able to distinguish approximatly 6 major currents:

1) Algebraic topology and homological algebra

2) Abelian categories

3) Algebraic Geometry and topos theory=20

4) Logic and elementary topos theory

5) Category theory and computer science

6) Higher categories with homotopy theory =20

Here is an example of a recent applications of category theory to =
geometry:

"Associahedral categories, particles and Morse functor"=20
by Jean-Yves Welschinger http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4712=20

The n-category caff=E9 is an extraordinary experiment in=20
research collaboration and dissimination of knowledge.
It maybe the way of the future.
But an old mathematicians like me find it=20
difficult to adapt to this new form of collaboration.=20

Yep! And we should not remain passive.

Best,
