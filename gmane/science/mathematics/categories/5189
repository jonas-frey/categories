Greetings to all,

After a thread in the mailing list ALGTOP-L regarding mathematical review
services led to a discussion of possible collaborative web-based systems,
the following forum was created (many thanks to Andrew Stacey for taking
the initiative) to try to design one such service:

http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/rForum/

>From the first post:

"The primary purpose of this site is to put together a design for a
website where mathematicians can record reviews, corrections, and other
relevant information, of mathematical resources."

I thought it would be a good idea to publicize it here to further the
discussion (despite some overlap with the ALGTOP-L mailing list where
this originated). Also, due to the occasional discussion of web-based
collaborative mathematical resources that crops up in the categories
mailing list, I thought this would be fertile ground for broadening the
audience of this forum.

Sincerely,
Ricardo
