Thanks to all the suggestions for `flow chart' graphics.
I had first asked the alg top list and had no responses
whereas here I've received 4 or 5 suggestions


gastex,
dia (on Linux)
xy-pic
xfig
 "The LaTeX Graphics Companion",
Goossens, Rahtz, and Mittelbach
use the xy-pic and PSTricks packages
to draw flowcharts.

if anyone has used more than one and cares to comment,
I would appreciate that

as for example

This can be done, with the dint of much pain, with XyPic directly in
LaTeX.  The layout tends to be perfect, but learning how to use the tool
for anything beyond the simplest diagrams is remarkably painful.

On the other hand, xfig produces very nice results with manual layout,
and
is really quite easy to use (though figuring out how to drop the
diagrams
into your LaTeX document has its surprises).
