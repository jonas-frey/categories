                       CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                          JOINT MEETING OF

            the Twenty-Third EACSL Annual Conference on
                    COMPUTER SCIENCE LOGIC (CSL)
                                AND
           the Twenty-Ninth Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on

CSL is the annual meeting of the European Association for Computer Science
Logic (EACSL) intended for computer scientists whose research activities
involve logic, as well as for logicians working on issues significant for
computer science.

LICS is an annual international forum on theoretical and practical topics in
computer science that relate to logic.

The organizers of these two series of meetings have chosen to join the 2014
editions of these meetings into a single event within the Federated Logic
Conference (FLoC) that will be part of the Vienna Summer of Logic 2014. Thus,
in 2014, these meetings have one program committee, one program, and one
proceedings.


INVITED SPEAKERS

Christel Baier (TU Dresden)
Patrick Cousot (ENS Paris and NYU)


INVITED TUTORIAL SPEAKERS

Assia Mahboubi (INRIA Saclay)
Jasmin Fisher (MSR Cambridge)
