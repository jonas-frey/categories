Dear Tony,

I pointed out this fact in my reply (see below) to one of your earlier
questions. In fact you don't need symmetry, and L is automatically strong
monoidal.

Dear Tony,

Yes, it is true. More generally, let F-|U:W-->V be a monoidal adunction.

This means that V and W are monoidal categories, F and U are monoidal
functors, monoidal natural transformations 1-->UF and FU-->1 satisfying the
triangle equations.

(A monoidal functor F:V-->W involves maps FX\otimes FY-->F(X\otimes Y)
and I_W-->F(I_V), not necessarily invertible, but satisfying coherence
conditions. In a monoidal adjunction, as above, the monoidal functor F is
necessarily strong, so that the comparison maps are invertible. The
comparison maps for U need not be invertible.)

For a small V-category K and a W-category C we do indeed have an isomorphism
    V-Fun(K,UC) = U(W-Fun(FK,C))
of V-categories. I'll do my best to explain this via ascii.


V-functors from K to UC are in bijection with W-functors from FK to C; this
takes care of the object-part. For V-functors M,N:K-->UC,
the hom-object V-Fun(K,UC)(M,N) is the equalizer of the evident maps
               --->
Pi_k UC(Mk,Nk) ---> Pi_{k,l} [K(k,l), UC(Mk,Nl)]
in V, where the products run over all objects k and l of K.

On the other hand, U(W-Fun(FK,C)(M,N)) is given by the equalizer of
                 -->
U(Pi_k C(Mk,Nk)) --> U Pi_{k,l} [FK(k,l),C(Mk,Nl)]
or equivalently, since U is a left adjoint, the equalizer of
               -->
Pi_k UC(Mk,Nk) --> Pi_{k,l} U[FK(k,l),C(Mk,Nl)]

So we are now left to prove

Lemma: U[FX,Y]=[X,UY], for X in V and Y in W.
Proof:

V(Z,U[FX,Y]) = W(FZ,[FX,Y]) = W(FZ\otimes FX,Y) = W(F(Z\otimes X),Y)
             = V(Z\otimes X,UY) = V(Z,[X,UY])

naturally in Z and so U[FX,Y]=[X,UY] as required.

Steve Lack.
