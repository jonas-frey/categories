Actually I was going to ask about Ab.  I thought it was abelian groups
but (maybe I'm just the last to be told) the context suggests Ab =
topological abelian groups.  Is there life in discrete circles?

(To reconcile the subject line with the underlined line you need to know
Mike's usage: the large print giveth and the small print taketh away.
Chu is to chu as preordered sets are to posets, or topological spaces
to T_0 spaces.)
