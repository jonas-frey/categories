The operations of Q-alg are the functions between the powers of the set Z,
forming the (Lawvere) theory T of Q-algebras, which are product-preserving
functors from T to Set.  (So if Z is 3 then there are 27 = 3^3 "Boolean"
operations in place of the familiar 4 = 2^2.)  With all powers Q-algebras are
equivalent to CABAs, with only finite powers and finite-product-preserving
functors they are equivalent to Boolean algebras.

A natural next question would be, what is obtained when T is taken to be
Set itself, in each of the cases when the functors T->Set are required to
preserve all limits, and just the discrete ones?
