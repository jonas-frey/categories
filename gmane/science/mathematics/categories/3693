Here's at least a partial conceptual explanation of
Richard Garner's "curiosity". There are really three
categories involved, all of them toposes: they are
the functor categories [2,Set] where 2 denotes the
discrete two-object category, [I,Set] where I denotes the
category (* --> *) and [G,Set] where G has two objects and
two parallel arrows between them. The inclusions
f: 2 --> I and g: 2 --> G of course induce essential
geometric morphisms (strings of three adjoint functors)

          f           g
[I,Set] <--- [2,Set] ---> [G,Set]

and Richard's functors are simply the composites
g_*f^* and f_!g^*. So it's no surprise that they
should be adjoint: also, the adjunction (g^* -| g_*)
is comonadic, because g is surjective on objects.
The only oddity is that (f_! -| f^*) is also
comonadic (it's obviously monadic, again because f
is surjective on objects). As far as I can see, this is
just an isolated fact: it isn't a particular case of any
general result that I know.
