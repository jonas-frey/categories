Meanwhile the existence of some who prefer adding "or argument" to=20
"evidence" seems to have been established.  Maybe one day they'll=20
surrrender, but this is not my highest priority.  Higher is to make the=20
following title changes on Wikipedia:

Proof (truth)     --->     Proof
Proof             --->     Proof (disambiguation)

The first is the article on proof, the second is the Wikipedia=20
disambiguation or dab page that takes you to other meanings such as=20
"alcoholic proof" (an obsolete term even in the US, having been replaced=20
by "alcohol by volume" or ABV) and proofreading.  The suggested change=20
would make the article on proof the primary topic (a Wikipedia concept)=20
having a so-called hatnote (note at the head of the article) pointing to=20
a disambiguation page for the lesser meanings.  So far no but myself and=20
one or two people have spoken up for this; until they do nothing will=20
change.

I would divide proofs into two kinds, those where the intended audience=20
can argue back, as in a courtroom or ordinary conversation, and those=20
where they can't, for example the subscribers to a journal.  What you=20
describe does cover both, but for the latter the game is very short.

In computation this distinction is that between alternating computation=20
and nondeterministic computation.  Alternation computation is an=20
on-going game, in non-deterministic computation one player makes one=20
choice and the game ends.  Interestingly the notion of nondeterministic=20
computation preceded that of alternating computation under that name by=20
some 15 years or so.  But Fra=EFss=E9's alternation preceded both by a=20
decade, although it took a decade for Ehrenfeucht to cast Fra=EFss=E9's=20
approach as a game (1961).
