Dear categorists,

Some remarks about topological and categorical models of directed algebraic=
=20
topology.

Indeed, d-spaces have a lot of interesting features as topological model si=
nce=20
i also work in a recent preprint with multipointed d-spaces (1) and i prove=
=20
that from a homotopical point of view, they are the topological version (in=
=20
the sense of concrete topological functors) of the category of flows (Or on=
 the=20
contrary, the flows are a categorical version of multipointed d-spaces). I =
had=20
introduced them for studying branching and merging homology theories, which=
=20
require a specific feature of the topological model that d-spaces do not ha=
ve.=20
This study can also be done with multipointed d-spaces in theory, but the=20
theory remains to be written (I am working on that...). I also have a model=
=20
structure on multipointed d-spaces preserving the homotopy type of path=20
spaces. I'd like to mention in this mail that I do not know how to prove th=
at=20
it is left-proper and any idea would be really welcome.

Concerning cubical sets now. The usual degeneracy maps have no interest in=
=20
computer science. But they do not "disturb". On the contrary, there is a ne=
w=20
kind of degeneracy map that I call transverse degeneracy (2) which are of=20
interest in computer science. The symmetric transverse precubical sets  are=
=20
the only kind of precubical set such that the 1-dimensional coskeleton func=
tor=20
is well-behaved from a computer science point of view (see (2)). The base=20
category \widehat{\square} appears also in the study of topological models =
of=20
concurrency. Roughly speaking, the space of morphisms from a topological m-
cube to a topological n-cube preserving the labelling will be always homoto=
py=20
equivalent to \widehat{\square}([m],[n]), if the m+n labels are the same (i=
f=20
they are not the same, it will be homotopy equivalent to the subset=20
corresponding to maps preserving the labelling of course).

Precubical sets are enough to model all process algebras (3) but they are t=
oo=20
poor for a mathematical treatment, even in the combinatorial world. For=20
example, in the category of precubical sets, the labelled square correspond=
ing=20
to the concurrent execution of a and b is not isomorphic to the labelled=20
square corresponding to the concurrent execution of b and a if a<>b !=20
Symmetric precubical sets are better (or less bad) because this drawback=20
disappears. Transverse symmetric precubical sets are even better but they a=
re=20
more complicated to understand. I have an explicit combinatorial descriptio=
n=20
of the symmetric precubical set of labels. I do not have such a description=
=20
for the transverse symmetric precubical set of labels for example.
Symmetric precubical sets are also related to higher dimensional transition=
=20
systems in a non-trivial way: the latter can be identified to a full reflec=
tive=20
subcategory of the (labelled) former (4).
