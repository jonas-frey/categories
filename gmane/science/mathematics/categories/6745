I completely agree with Ronnie and George.
.
For the history, in 2009 I had exchanges of mails with Rafael
Borowiecki (who also used the nickname of Hasse Riemann). I did not
know him but he wrote that he was publishing a timeline and sent me a
lot of questions about the works of Charles Ehresmann and myself on
categories. I took a lot of time to respond to him in details, with
corrections to some of his assertions and proposal of new entries.
Since then I had no news from him, and most of the information I sent
him does not appear in the present timeline.
