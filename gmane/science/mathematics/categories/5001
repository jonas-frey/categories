I don't think this construction works at the level of sets rather than
categories. The problem is that k-Set is a category, not a set, so T(S)
also has a category structure, and you can't simply "forget" this. If
you do, then you have the problem "*which* singleton set?" for the
unit (i.e., which singleton set do you choose as the domain of the
functions 1 --> S which you identify with elements of S?), and
whichever choice you make you are going to run into problems verifying the
monad identities.

This is correct, and it's well-known: it is the monad which freely adjoins
k-small coproducts to a category.
