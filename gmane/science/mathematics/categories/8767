                         CALL FOR PAPERS
                         ---------------

Since their introduction in the early 1970s, vector space models of
meaning have evolved into a well-established area of research in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). Their probabilistic nature and ability to
exploit the abundance of large-scale resources such as the Web make them
one of the most useful tools (arguably the most successful (Turney and
Pantel, 2010)) for modeling what we broadly call meaning in language.
The geometry provided by the angular distance between the vectors has
been widely used as a representative of the degree of similarity of
meaning in NLP.

Another field in which vector space models play an important role is
physics, and especially quantum theory. Though seemingly unrelated to
language, intriguing connections have recently been uncovered. Some
examples include models of compositionality in distributional semantics
(Coecke et al. 2010), treatments of logical words in vector space models
(Widdows, 2003), reasoning about the human mental lexicon in cognitive
processes (Bruza et al., 2009), using vectors of queries and documents
in information retrieval (Van Rijsbergen, 2004), and representing the
meaning of words by density operators (Piedeleu et al., 2015). There is
also a long-standing history of vector space models in cognitive science.
Theories of categorization such as those developed by Nosofsky (1986);
Smith, Osherson, Rips, & Keane, (1988), utilise notions of distance
between concepts represented as feature vectors. More recently G=E4rdenfors
(2004) has developed a model of concepts in which conceptual spaces
provide geometric structures, and information is represented by points,
vectors and regions in vector spaces.

Exploiting the common ground provided by the concept of a vector space,
the workshop aims to bring together researchers working at the intersection
of NLP, cognitive science, and physics, offering to them an appropriate
forum for presenting their uniquely motivated work and ideas. The interplay
between these three disciplines will foster theoretically motivated
approaches to understanding how meanings of words interact with each
other in sentences and discourse, how diagrammatic reasoning depicts and
simplifies this interaction, how language models are determined by input
from the world, and how word and sentence meanings interact logically.
Topics of interest include (but are not restricted to):

* Reasoning in semantic spaces
* Applications of quantum logic in natural language processing
* Compositionality in semantic spaces and conceptual spaces
* Links between conceptual spaces and natural language processing
* Modeling functional words such as prepositions and relative pronouns
   in compositional distributional models of meaning
* Diagrammatic reasoning for natural language processing

SUBMISSION
----------
We solicit papers that describe original work. The submitted papers may
consist of up to 6 pages of content (including references) in the EPTCS
format (http://style.eptcs.org/). Authors are invited to submit their
papers via EasyChair:

A selection of the accepted papers will be presented orally, and the rest
of them as posters. Depending on participation and quality of submissions,
the proceedings of the workshop will be published as an EPTCS
(Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science) volume.
