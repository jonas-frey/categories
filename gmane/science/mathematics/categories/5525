Your test is addressed in more detail in other replies, but to pull out =
one idea that comes up in several:

--- the diagonal embedding is not always the equality relation.

I don't think I've seen anyone propose how to define a notion of =
category in the absence of some kind of diagonal embedding, but Francois =
Larmarche and others nicely describe various situations (topological =
spaces, higher categories, intensional type theories...) where the =
diagonal embedding isn't a well-behaved equality relation, and certainly =
isn't the one we want.

For example, one such situation is explored by Gambino and Garner in =
"The identity type weak factorisation system".  Roughly: you can have =
logical categories where a predicate S ---> A on an object means not a =
monic, but rather a _fibration_, for some wfs (or similar structure).  =
The diagonal embedding A >--> AxA may fail to be a fibration; then the =
equality predicate E comes from the factorisation of this map as a left =
map (think "cofibrant weak equivalence") followed by a fibration:

A >--> E ---> AxA.

The groupoid case is a nice example of this situation, as described in =
that paper.

So the notions of "diagonal embedding" and "equality relation" can =
certainly diverge (even in situations where both exist); and I think the =
insight of Mike Shulman and co. here is that "diagonal embedding" is the =
one which (if either) is wanted in the definition of a category.
