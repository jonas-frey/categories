Dear Vaughan,

Your proposed characterization is actually a characterization of full
subcategories of [J^op,Set] containing the representables. To get the whole
presheaf category you should add that C is cocomplete, and that homming out
of objects in J is cocontinuous (i.e. C(j,-) is cocontinuous for all j in
J).

Steve.
