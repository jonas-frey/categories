Dear Marta,

Mathematics and science are very often regarded
as the pure product of human rationality.
I can agree with the importance of rationality, except that humanity
is as much the product of nature as it is of rational choices.
You will agree that the natural world is only partially explained by scienc=
e.
The rest is a big mystery. Not that the mystery is absolutly impenetrable.
I feel compelled to recognize the presence of mysteries even
in mathematics. The history of complex numbers, from the
discovery by Cardano to their applications in quantum physics is bewilderin=
g.
They belong to this universe as much as the electron and the human mind.
The fact that we human can understand  complex numbers may
have a metaphysical meaning.
What is it?

Best,
Andr=E9

Dear all,

The above is a quotation from a recent posting by Andre Joyal.  To the risk=
  of boring everyone I offer the following comment on it here. There is no n=
eed to talk about miracles in mathematics, not even as some sort of analogy=
. Why not instead give credit to the very important insight of an elementar=
y topos as embodying both the logic and the geometry? There are two notions=
  of morphism between elementary toposes, not a preferred one - the geometri=
c and the logical. One structure - to wit that of an elementary topos, can =
be seen in two different ways depending on what the mathematical uses one w=
ants to give it. There is no confusion here  - just richness. Let me be mor=
e specific.


Thinking of an elementary topos S as the chosen "set theory", a Grothendiec=
k topos (including any category of the form Sh(X) for X a locale in S, but =
more generally as a category of sheaves on a site in S) can be recovered as=
  a pair (E, e) where E is another elementary topos and e: E -> S a bounded =
geometric morphism. Thinking of elementary toposes from the logical point o=
f view, and so of logical morphisms between them, there are other ideas and=
  constructions that profit from this point of view - for instance a formula=
tion and proof of realizability by means of Artin-Wraith glueing.


Both the geometric and the logical are sides of the same coin. The notion o=
f an elementary topos (or "topos" for short) is simple yet powerful and unt=
il now it has served most of the mathematical purposes for which it was int=
ended and more.


Best wishes,

Marta
