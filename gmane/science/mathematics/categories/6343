I'm afraid I say this every time "schizophrenic" objects come up, but here
I go again...

Let's not use that word.

To quote the Guardian style guide (http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/s):

     schizophrenia, schizophrenic

     use only in a medical context, never to mean "in two minds",
     contradictory, or erratic, which is wrong, as well as offensive to
     people diagnosed with this illness.

There is a concise summary of the history and terminology at

     http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dualizing+object

which also links to a discussion of alternatives.  "Dualizing object" and
"ambimorphic object" are both used.

Best wishes,
Tom
