 DEFINITION. Let X be some structure on categories. By this, I mean
 that there is a given 2-category called X-Cat, whose objects are
 called X-categories, whose morphisms are called X-functors, and whose
 2-cells are called X-transformations, and for which there is a given
 2-functor U to Cat, called the forgetful functor.

 We say that X is "transported along equivalences of categories" if the
 following holds. Given an X-category D', with underlying category D =3D
 U(D'), and a category C, and an equivalence (F,G,e,h) of categories D
 and C, where F: D -> C, G: C -> D, and e: FG -> id_C, h: GF -> id_D,
 it is then possible to find:

 (1) an X-category C' whose underlying category U(C') is isomorphic
     [not equivalent!] to C. Let c : U(C') -> C be the isomorphism
     (i.e., an invertible functor in Cat) with inverse c': C -> U(C');

 (2) an X-equivalence of X-categories (F',G',e',h'), where
     F': D' -> C', G': C' -> D', e': F'G' -> id_C', and h': G'F' -> id_D'
     [the concept of equivalence makes sense in any 2-category];

 such that

 (3) (U(F'), U(G'), U(e'), U(h')) =3D (cF, Gc', cec', h).

 Here, cF and Gc' denotes composition of functors, and cec' denotes
 whiskering.

 The structure X is called "evil" iff it is not transported along
 equivalences of categories.

 This finishes the definition.

More informally, "transported along equivalences" therefore means that
if D and C are equivalent, and D has an X-structure, then there is a
way to equip C with an X-structure and to lift the original equivalence
to an X-equivalence.

There was a need for the isomorphism c in the definition, because the
forgetful functor U : X-Cat -> Cat may not be strictly speaking
surjective onto 0-cells in some real-life examples (and in any case,
this forgetful functor may sometimes only be well-defined up to
isomorphism). It is important that c is an isomorphism, rather than an
equivalence, because else the definition becomes vacuous (and we are
precisely interested in notions that are not well-defined up to
equivalence).

Also note that I didn't require the data (C',F',G',e',h') to be
unique, not even up to equivalence in X-Cat. Although in practice, it
will often be unique in this sense. So my definition allows for a
given structure to be transported "in essentially more than one way"
along a given equivalence. I am open to strengthening the definition
to forbid this.



Dear all,

A quick pointer to a variation on this matter, which has already been aroun=
d
(I presented it at CT07).
The nature of 2-categorical structures that transport along equivalences is
nicely captured by the notion of Equ-iso-fibration:

DEFINITION
A 2-functor F:E =E2=86=92 B is an Equ-iso-fibration if:

 - it admits cartesian liftings of (adjoint) equivalences and

 - every hom F(X,Y):E(X,Y) =E2=86=92 B(FX,FY) admits cartesian lifitings of
isomorphism 2-cells, and such liftings are preserved by precomposition
(pointwise).

Notice that a cartesian lifting of an adjoint equivalence is another such.
The notions of cartesian liftings used here are those for 2-fibrations (as
in the references below); they involve the expected 2-dimensional property
for 1-cells.
The liftings are strict.

The most interesting example of such a structure is the forgetful functor o=
f
a 2-cateogory of pseudo-algebras
V: Ps-T-Alg =E2=86=92 K, for a 2-monad T on a 2-category K (or a pseudo-mon=
ad on a
bicategory). They include all the known interesting examples of
pseudo-structures, the classical such being monoidal categories. The
morphisms in Ps-T-Alg are strong ones, preserving structure up to coherent
isomorphism. The observation that pseudo-algebras do transport along
equivalences is credited to Max Kelly in Power=C2=B4s article below.

I used this notion to capture the following universality of coherence:
coherence for such pseudo-algebras (meaning that we can strictify every
pseudo-algebra into a equivalent strict T-algebra) is equivalent to the
statement

THM: The inclusion 2-functor J: T-alg =E2=86=92 Ps-T-alg makes V: Ps-T-alg =
=E2=86=92 K the
FREE Equ-iso-fibration over
U:T-alg =E2=86=92 K

In other words, the passage from strict algebras (with their strict
morphisms) to pseudo-algebras (and strong morphisms) is the universal way o=
f
achieving transportability along equivalences.
