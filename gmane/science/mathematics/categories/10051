======================================================================


The 36th Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming
Semantics (MFPS 2020) takes place at University of Paris Saclay,
France, June 1???5, 2020.

MFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and
computer science that are related to models of computation in general,
and to semantics of programming languages in particular. This is a
forum where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet
and exchange ideas. The participation of researchers in neighbouring
areas is strongly encouraged.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
bio-computation; concurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed
systems; process calculi; probabilistic systems; constructive
mathematics; domain theory and categorical models; formal languages;
formal methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; programming-language
theory; quantum computation; security; topological models; logic; type
systems; type theory. We also welcome contributions that address
applications of semantics to novel areas such as complex systems,
markets, and networks, for example.

INVITED SPEAKERS & SPECIAL SESSIONS:

As in previous years, MFPS will have several invited speakers and
special session highlighting areas within programming languages
semantics. We are pleased to announce the following invited speakers
