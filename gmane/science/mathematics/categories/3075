By a presentation in mathematics I mean exactly the same thing, I agree with
every word you said in this paragraph, and I know that what we call today
Lawvere theories was your beautiful discovery along this lines to thoughts.

I am sorry, what is "presented" in Definition 7.2.1 can of course be
considered as a subcategory of the category of finite sets, but certainly
not full (because, say, there are no arrows from C_1 to C_2). I suppose you
have noticed this, and so you are suggesting to modify the Definition
7.2.1 - since in "all" examples in fact there are more arrows. Well, one
could do so, but there is also a good reason not to do so: those five
generators and five relations is exactly the minimum needed to define
internal actions (I have actually first used this definition in my CT90
paper "Precategories and Galois theory" and many other people used similar
definitions for other purposes, probably long before).

Having said this, I again agree with every word of the rest of your message.
Can you accept the fact I agree with it and at the same time I do like
Definition 7.2.1? Note that if we go one step down in dimension, there will
be reflexive graphs whose "theory" is a full subcategory of sets and just
graphs whose "theory" is not. Are you telling me that this is a good reason
to forget the notion of graph, and use only reflexive graphs?

George
