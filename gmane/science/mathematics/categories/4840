2010 FEDERATED LOGIC CONFERENCE (FLoC'10)

  Edinburgh, Scotland, U.K.
  July 9-21, 2010
  http://www.floc-conference.org

* In 1996, as part of its Special Year on Logic and Algorithms, DIMACS hosted
  the first Federated Logic Conference (FLoC). It was modeled after the
  successful Federated Computer Research Conference (FCRC), and synergetically
  brought together conferences that apply logic to computer science.  The
  second Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'99) was held in Trento, Italy,
  in 1999, the third (FLoC'02) was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2002, and
  the fourth (FLoC'06) was held in Seattle, Washington, USA.

* We are pleased to announce the fifth Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'10)
  to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland, U.K. (www.edinburgh.org), in July 2010,
  at the School of Informatics at University of Edinburgh (www.inf.ed.ac.uk).

* The following conferences will participate in FLoC:
  Int'l Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV)
  Int'l Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP)
  Int'l Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR)
  Int'l Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP)
  IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)
  Int'l Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA)
  Int'l Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT)

* Pre-conference workshops will be held on July 9-10.  ITP, LICS, RTA, and SAT
  will be held in parallel on July 11-14, to be followed by mid-conference
  workshops on July 14-15. CAV, ICLP, and IJCAR will be held in parallel on
  July 16-19, to be followed by post-conference workshops on July 20-21.
  Plenary events involving all the conferences are planned. There will be
  receptions in the Edinburgh Castle and at the National Galleries of Scotland.

* The call for workshop proposals can be found at the FLoC web page
  (http://www.floc-conference.org). Calls for papers will be issued in the
  near future. For additional information regarding the participating meetings,
  please check the FLoC web page later this summer.
