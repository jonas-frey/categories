****************************************************************
                      Category Theory NovemberFest
                     Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh
                 Saturday - Sunday, November 14-15, 2009
****************************************************************

We invite you to join us in Pittsburgh this Fall for a weekend meeting
in Category Theory, a translation of the traditional OctoberFest.

VENUE:

The meeting will be held at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
The talks will be held on Saturday and Sunday morning, in Baker Hall
A53,
on the CMU campus.  See the maps and travel information on the website:

	http://www.cmu.edu/about/visit/index.shtml

REGISTRATION:

There is no official registration, but please let us know (by email
to awodey@cmu.edu)
if you plan to attend, if possible.   Those who wish to speak should
inform the organizers
at least one week in advance.

WEBSITE:

There is a rudimentary website at:

	http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/NovemberFest.htm

More information will be posted here as the meeting draws near.

HOTELS:

Some hotel options are listed on the website.
We have been able to reserve a block of 20 rooms at a special rate,
as follows:

Wyndham Hotel
412-683-2040 (ask for In-house reservations)
Special rate of $119/night +tax
Participants must mention they are coming for Novemberfest at CMU
Participants must book their room by October 13 to secure this
special rate

TRAVEL:

Air fares between Pittsburgh and Montreal/Ottawa seem to be running
quite high at the moment, for some reason.  We've recently had good luck
booking a flight/hotel combination through priceline.com -- maybe
worth a try.
There is a very convenient bus between the airport and Oakland, where
CMU
and the hotels are located.  Look for the 28X Airport Flyer stop near
the taxi stand
(the fare is $2.75).  There is a stop at the Wyndham.


SOCIAL:

We will announce a meeting place for Friday evening.
There will be a social event on Saturday evening.
Talks will end by 1PM on Sunday.


Please feel free to ask for any further information.
Hoping to see many of you in Pittsburgh in November!
