Dear David,

I appreciate your view.
I would love to have the dictatorial power to reform=20
the mathematical vocabulary.
I dream of kicking out long words like diffeomorphism and homeomorphism.
I guess that if they have persisted in mathematics, it is because
everybody understand them.

It is very difficult to impose a new terminology.
There is a social aspect to the problem.
Even if small group of peoples agree in using
a new terminology, this may have little influence on the larger =
community.
The new word may become a tag for identifying the members of a group.
It may enclose its user into a sub-culture.

Best,
andr=E9

Dear Andre:

Brevity is the usual reason for introducing new terminology.

And, ultimately there is a need, as mathematics would grind
to a halt if one had to write out a phrase giving the content
of each concept whenever one wanted to talk about it.

One may object to the jocular use of a word with a moral
denotation as the name for a mathematical concept, but four=20
characters beats 28 characters (or 31 if one counts spaces).

It certainly seems desirable to have a brief name for either
"invariant under equivalence" or "not invariant under=20
equivalence".

Best Thoughts,
David Y.
