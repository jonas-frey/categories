Dear Paul,

I proved a "topical" version of this as Propn 2.3.7 in my "Topical
Categories of Domains" (1999).

"Topical" here means working in the 2-category of Grothendieck
toposes and geometric morphisms instead of that of categories and
functors. Instead of objects of a category and morphisms between
them, it deals with points of a topos and natural transformations
between them. (Note that I use the term "F-structures" instead of "F-
algebras".)

In this setting there are some subtleties of interpretation. An
initial F-structure is defined as a point of the classifying topos [F-
struct] for F-structures that is initial amongst all the generalized
points - making [F-struct] a local topos. Nonetheless, the argument
is essentially one that you might use with categories and functors.

I remarked that my results were familiar from the category context as
set out in Freyd's 1991 paper "Algebraically complete categories". I
cannot remember if your result on FG-algebras and GF-algebras was in
Freyd.

All the best,

Steve.
