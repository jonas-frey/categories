There has been quite a lot of work on fuzzy sets and topos
theory: a Google search for "fuzzy sets topos", or
"fuzzy logic topos",  will turn up quite a lot of it.
I find it a bit surprising that there is so much
work, given the sociological characteristics of the
communities involved. But it's there anyway.
