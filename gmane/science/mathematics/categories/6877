                        PhD Position
                                in
     Category Theory and Functional Programming

     Department of Computer and Information Sciences
          University of Strathclyde, Scotland

Applications are invited for one PhD position within the Mathematically
Structured Programming group at the University of Strathclyde. The group
comprises Prof. Neil Ghani, Dr. Patricia Johann, Dr. Conor McBride, Dr.
Peter Hancock, Dr. Robert Atkey, and six PhD students. The PhD project
centres around applications of categorical methods to functional programming
languages. The project is under the direction of Patricia Johann.

The successful applicant will have either a first-class degree or an MSc in
Mathematics or Computing Science or a related subject with a strong
Mathematics or Computing Science component. Ideally, they will also have a
strong, documented interest in doing research. Strong mathematical
background and problem-solving skills are essential; good programming skills
are a plus. Prior knowledge of category theory and/or functional programming
is an advantage, but is not required.

The PhD position is for 3 years; it must be started before September
2012 at the latest, but will preferably be started earlier. The position
is a fully-funded post for a UK or EU student, and includes both coverage
of fees and an EPSRC-level stipend for each of the three years. Fees for
non-EU students are covered only at the UK or EU student level.

The University of Strathclyde (http://www.strath.ac.uk) is located in the
heart of Glasgow, which Lonely Planet Travel Guides hail as "one of
Britain's largest, liveliest and most interesting cities" (see
http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/scotland/glasgow/). Southern Scotland
provides a particularly stimulating environment for researchers in
theoretical computer science, with active groups in this area at Heriot-Watt
University, the University of Edinburgh, the University of Glasgow, the
University of St. Andrews, and the University of Strathclyde.
