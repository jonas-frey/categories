What the origins of the argument Mac Lane outlines here are, I don't know=
=2E =

I do seem to recall that I first saw more or less such an argument in a =

graduate course Sammy gave at Columbia during the "golden era" 1958-1963,=
  =

and that Sammy himself, probably at a Bowdoin NSF summer semester on =

categories, revealed his deft trick by which to convert the argument for =

the "index greater than 2" case to a uniform argument ignoring the =

subgroup's index.

Let me record that argument here.

Given are a group G, a subgroup H of G, and an element a in G \ H.

P is to be the group of permutations of the underlying set of the left =

G-set got by forming the coproduct =


G/H + 1

of the principal left G-set G/H of left cosets xH of H in G (x =E2=88=88 =
G) =

with a (trivial) terminal left G-set 1 =3D {*} (assume * =E2=88=89 G/H):

P =3D perm(|G/H| =E2=88=AA {*}) =3D (|G/H| =E2=88=AA {*})! .

One permutation in particular is to be singled out for attention: the =

transposition t =E2=88=88 P interchanging * with the coset H itself.

Let me use r: G --> P for the result of composing the regular =

representation of G by left action (g, xH) |-> (gx)H on the cosets of H =

with the obvious injection of (|G/H|)! into (|G/H| =E2=88=AA {*})! -- thu=
s:

[r(g)](xH) =3D (gx)H  ,
[r(g)](*) =3D * .

And let me write s: G --> P for the result of conjugating by t the variou=
s =

assorted values of r -- thus:

[s(g)](xH) =3D t([r(g)](t(xH))) ,
[s(g)](*) =3D t([r(g)](t(*))) =3D t([r(g)](H)) =3D t(gH) .

The end-game strategy is now this:

(i) for h =E2=88=88 H: r(h) =3D s(h) ; yet
(ii) for g =3D a, [r(a)](*) =3D * but [s(a)](*) =3D aH (whence r =E2=89=A0=
  s).

Details: Bear in mind that if, for x in G and h in H, we have (hx)H =3D H=
, =

we must have hx in H, whence also x in H so that xH =3D H. Then for (i):

(a) if xH =E2=89=A0 H -- [s(h)](xH) =3D t([r(h)](xH)) =3D t((hx)H) =3D (h=
x)H =3D [r(h)](xH)
;
(b) if xH =3D H -- [s(h)](H) =3D t([r(h)](*)) =3D t(*) =3D H =3D [r(h)](H=
) ;
(c) and at * -- [s(h)](*) =3D t([r(h)](H)) =3D t(H) =3D * =3D [r(h)](*) .=


And bear in mind also that aH =E2=89=A0 H because a =E2=88=89 H; thus:

for (ii) -- [s(a)](*) =3D t([r(a)](H)) =3D t(aH) =3D aH =E2=89=A0 * =3D [=
r(a)](*) .

By the way, if the subgroup H had index 3 or more in G, one need not =

require recourse to any external element * as above -- one could let any =

coset other than H and aH (when there are such) play the role of *, and, =

with but a few additional wrinkles (unless I am mistaken (which is always=
  =

possible :-) )), I believe that is essentially how the proof George cites=
  =

from Mac Lane's exercise works.

Cheers, -- Fred

[NB: I'm writing =E2=88=88 for an element symbol, =E2=88=89 for a crossed=
-out =

element symbol, =E2=88=AA for a union symbol, and =E2=89=A0 for a crossed=
-out equal =

sign. With luck these HTML glyph constructs will simply display as the =

glyphs they're meant to represent; and if not, they're no more painful to=
  =

decipher than their TeX counterparts, which HTML can't display as glyphs.=
