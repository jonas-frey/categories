CMCS 2010 Pre-announcement/call for papers
------------------------------------------------------

The Tenth International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science
26-28 March 2010, Cyprus, Greece (co-located with ETAPS 2010)

Aims and scope
------------------

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers
with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its applications.
Over the last two decades, coalgebra has developed into a field of
its own, presenting a mathematical foundation for various kinds
of dynamical systems, infinite data structures, and logics.
Coalgebra has an ever growing range of applications in and interactions
with other fields such as reactive and interactive system theory,
object oriented and concurrent programming, formal system specification,
modal logic, dynamical systems, control systems, category theory,
algebra, analysis, etc.

An anniversary: the 10th CMCS
----------------------------------------

CMCS took place for the first time when ETAPS started, in 1998.
Since then, it has always been collocated with ETAPS, becoming
bi-annual since the start of CALCO (Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra)
in 2005.

In 2010, we will celebrate the 10th edition of CMCS,
by inviting a number of specialists in the field to present overviews
of both obtained results and future challenges.


Programme Committee
--------------------- -----
Chairs: Bart Jacobs (RUN) and Jan Rutten (CWI, VUA, RUN).
Members: to be announced shortly.


Organising Committee
--------------------------

Bart Jacobs,
Milad Niqui (co-chair, CWI),
Jan Rutten,
Alexandra Silva (co-chair, CWI).



Submissions
--------------
There are two types of submissions possible:

(a) Papers to be evaluated by the PC for publication in the proceedings:
They must have a length no greater than 20 pages.
(Style files will be provided shortly.)

They must contain original contributions,
be clearly written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison
with related work.
Accepted papers will appear in either ENTCS or EPTCS.

Also a special journal issue of selected papers will be considered.

(b) Short contributions:
These will not be published in the proceedings
but will be bundled in a CWI technical report.

They should be no more than two pages and may describe work in progress,
summarise work submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere,
or in some other way appeal to the CMCS audience.
