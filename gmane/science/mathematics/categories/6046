                     GAMES 2010

     Annual Workshop of the ESF Networking Programme on

         Games for Design and Verification

              September 19 - 23, 2010

          St Anne's College, Oxford, UK

              CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

================================================================

The ESF Networking Programme on Games for Design and Verification is a
European Network pursuing research and training on the design and
verification of computing systems.  GAMES is the annual workshop of the
Network. This year's GAMES workshop will be held at St. Anne's College
Oxford. More information about the games workshop can be found at
http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/games2010.


SCOPE:
The scope of the workshop includes the mathematical and algorithmic
analysis of finite and infinite games, the interplay of games with
automata theory and logic, and applications of games, automata, and
logic to the design and verification of computing systems.


PROGRAMME:
As in previous years, GAMES 2010 will be an informal workshop, without
proceedings. Its programme consists of six invited tutorials,
contributed talks (30 min) and short presentations (15 min).
Contributed talks and short presentations will be selected by the
programme committee on the basis of submitted abstracts. GAMES 2010
will also feature an open problem session, which will consist of very
short (10 min) descriptions of interesting open problems about games.


INVITED TUTORIALS:
- Roderick Bloem   (TU Graz, Austria)
- Thomas Colcombet (Liafa, Paris 7, France)
- Fedor Fomin (Bergen, Norway)
- Paul Goldberg (Liverpool, UK)
- Tristan Tomala  (HEC, Paris, France)
- Wieslaw Zielonka (Liafa, Paris 7, France)


SUPPORT:
There are a limited number of student support packages aimed at
students who cannot cover their own expenses. Those receiving such a
package will have their accommodation for the nights of September
19th-September 22nd pre-paid and will receive a contribution toward
travel costs.

To apply please send an email to games2010@comlab.ox.ac.uk stating
your affiliation, the name of your supervisor and your thesis topic.
Also we ask that you arrange for your supervisor to send a brief email
to the same address to indicate support for your application.

Since numbers are limited we encourage participants to apply as early
as possible.

REGISTRATION:
Registration is now open. Please see
http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/games2010/ for registration information.

LOCATION:
The workshop will be held in the Mary Ogilvie Lecture Theatre at St
Anne's College, Oxford UK. See http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/ for
