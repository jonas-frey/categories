John L. has recalled that the traditional definition of pca is motivated
by functional completeness.

>     (\lambda x.e) a [b_1/y_1,...,b_n/y_n] ~ e[a/x,b_1/y_1,...,b_n/y_n]

He also has pointed out that in realizability one always may replace a realizer
by one which is defined for more arguments. Thus, it appears as natural to
weaken the notion of functional completeness to the following "asymmetric"
variant:

    for every formal expression e (built up from variables x,y_1,...,y_n and
    constants from A via juxtaposition),
    there is a formal expression called (\lambda x.e), whose variables
    are just y_1,...,y_n, such that for all  a, b_1,...,b_n in A

       (\lambda x.e) a [b_1/y_1,...,b_n/y_n] = e[a/x,b_1/y_1,...,b_n/y_n]

    whenever the right hand side is defined

Certainly, this assymmetric version of functional completeness ensures the
existence of a  k  (with the usual properties) and an  s  in A with the
property that

    (*)  sabc = ac(bc)  whenever ac(bc) is defined

Obviously, from a  k  and an  s  satisfying (*) one can prove the assymmetric
version of functional completeness. Axiom (*) doesn't even exclude
undefinedness of  sa  (if  a.x  undefined for all x in A).

Probably, such very weak pca's are also equivalent to an ordinary one?

In any case the notion of pca is somewhat intensional in character. As we
know Asm(A) and Asm(A') are equivalent iff their categories of modest
projectives are equivalent. Concretely, for a pca A the category MP(A) of
modest projectives is nothing but the category of subsets of A and maps
f : P -> Q such that for some r in A we have ra = f(a)  for all  a in P.
Of course, we know from John L.'s work that MP(A) and MP(A') are equivalent
iff A and A' are applicatively equivalent.

What, alas, is not known is an intrinsic categorical characterisation of those
categories equivalent to MP(A) for some pca A. If we had such a
characterisation we would have arrived at a categorical characterisation of
categories of assemblies and, this, also of realizability toposes.
