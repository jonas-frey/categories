GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SFM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Formal methods are emerging in computer science as a prominent
approach to the rigorous design of computer, communication and
software systems.

The aim of the SFM series is to offer a good spectrum of
current research in foundations as well as applications of
formal methods, which can be of interest for graduate students
and young researchers who intend to approach the field.

This year SFM is devoted to multicore programming and covers
topics such as concurrency and coordination mechanisms,
architecture and memory models, and type systems.


COURSES AND LECTURERS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The school features the following lectures:

   "Parallel Objects for Multicores"
     Dave Clarke (Uppsala U, SE)

   "Concurrency in Java"
     Doug Lea (SUNY Oswego, US)

   "Coordinating Multicore Computing"
     Farhad Arbab (CWI Amsterdam, NL)

   "Automated Inference of Atomic Sets for Safe Concurrent Execution"
     Gul Agha (UI Urbana-Champaign, US)

   "Modeling of Architectures"
     Jade Alglave (UC London, UK)

   "Memory Models for Programming Languages"
     Francesco Zappa Nardelli (INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt, FR)

   "Multiparty Session Types"
     Nobuko Yoshida (IC London, UK)

   "Ownership Types"
     Sophia Drossopoulou (IC London, UK)

   "Types and Permissions in Mezzo"
     Francois Pottier (INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt, FR)

   "Safe Concurrent Programming with Linear Behavioral Types"
     Luis Caires (UN Lisbon, PT)

All participants will receive a copy of a tutorial book published by
Springer as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.


LOCATION
^^^^^^^^

SFM-15:MP will be held in the medieval hilltop town of Bertinoro.

This place is in Emilia Romagna, about 70 km south-east of Bologna,
at an elevation of about 230 m. It can be reached in a couple of
hours from the international airport "G. Marconi" of Bologna by
shuttle (from the airport to the railway station) + train (from
Bologna to Forli`) + bus/taxi (from the railway station to Bertinoro).

Bertinoro is close to many splendid locations such as Urbino,
Gradara, San Leo, and the Republic of San Marino, as well as some
less well-known locations like the thermal springs of Fratta Terme.
Bertinoro can also be a base for visiting some of the better-known
Italian locations such as Bologna, Parma, Rimini, Ravenna, Ferrara,
Padova, Venezia, Verona, Firenze, Pisa, Lucca, and Siena.

Bertinoro itself is picturesque, with its narrow streets and
walkways winding around the central peak. The school will be held
at the Centro Residenziale Universitario (CRU), an ex-episcopal
fortress that has been converted into a modern conference center.
From the fortress, it is possible to enjoy a beautiful vista stretching
from the Apennines to the Adriatic Coast and the Alps over the Po Valley.


ORGANIZATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scientific directors:
* Marco Bernardo       (U Urbino, IT)
* Einar Broch Johnsen  (U Oslo, NO)

Secretary:
* Monica Michelacci    (CRU Bertinoro, IT)


APPLICATION
^^^^^^^^^^^

Prospective participants should send by 21 March 2015
the application form, available on the school website,
to the two e-mail addresses below:

   Marco Bernardo
   marco.bernardo AT uniurb.it

   Monica Michelacci
   mmichelacci AT ceub.it

The registration fee is 300 euros and includes the school material.

The accommodation fee is 350 euros and covers the period June 14-20
(6 nights), double room (to share with another participant),
half board (breakfast and lunch from June 15, lunch of June 20 excluded).

The reduced accommodation fee for the participants who do not
need a room is 100 euros and covers the period June 15-19
(5 lunches).

A very limited number of grants is available to cover
the registration fee (no grant can be requested
to cover the accommodation fee or the travel expenses).

Notification of accepted/rejected applications and
grant requests will be communicated by March 31.

Registration to the school, including payment of fees,
is due by April 20.

No refund is possible for cancellation after May 15.
