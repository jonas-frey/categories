2. Complexity and Cryptography (Organising Chair: Xiaotie Deng)
3. Models of Computing and Networking (Organising Chairs: Anthony Bonato )
4. Programming and Verification (Organising Chair: Wenhui Zhang)

IMPORTANT DATES:

* Submission deadline: 11:59pm EST Jan. 10, 2012.
* Notification of authors: Feb. 20, 2012.
* Final versions deadline: Due on March 10, 2012.

PROCEEDINGS:

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, in
the LNCS Series by Springer.
Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the
conference.

POST CONFERENCE PUBLICATIONS:

Special issues of the journals Theoretical Computer Science and
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science devoted to a
selected set of accepted papers of the conference are planned.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

* Authors should submit an extended abstract (not a full paper).

* The submission should contain a scholarly exposition of ideas,
techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison
with related work.

* The length of the extended abstract should not exceed ten (10)
letter-sized pages (not including bibliography and appendices.)

* Submitted papers must describe work not previously published. They
must not be submitted simultaneously to another conference with refereed
proceedings. Research that is already submitted to a journal may be
submitted to TAMC12, provided that (a) the PC chair is notified in advance
that this is the case, and (b) it is not scheduled for journal
publication before the conference.
