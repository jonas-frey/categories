In June this past summer, Basil Rattray died at the age of 84.  Many
in the categorical community will remember Basil, particularly for his
work in category theory with Jim Lambek.  In his memory, his wife
Samaa has generously donated a sum of money to support students
attending the Categorical Octoberfest, being held at Concordia, 27-28
October 2012. It is our intention to divide this sum between students
attending the meeting, proportional to their expenses.  So, any grad
student who is planning to attend and would like support should write
me (Robert Seely) (by Oct 25 please) and make a request. We may or may
not be able to help with travel expenses, but we should be able to pay
for local hotel bills, although everything depends on how many
applicants there are. Participants will have to submit original bills
to be reimbursed. Sorry, but it will be impossible to provide money
beforehand.
