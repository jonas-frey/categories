Dear Colleagues,

It is a pleasure to let you know that a special volume of Theory and Applic=
ations of Categories will be published in honor of our friend Bob Rosebrugh=
.
As you know Bob has recently stepped down from his role as Managing Editor =
of TAC after 25 years of admirable work. We have no doubt that many colleag=
ues would like to thank him for his generous commitment to the journal and =
his scientific contributions.

To submit a paper you should send the pdf file to the address marino.gran@u=
clouvain.be<mailto:marino.gran@uclouvain.be>, possibly suggesting one of th=
e guest editors Michael Johnson, Walter Tholen, Richard Wood and Marino Gra=
n to be assigned to the paper. All submissions should be within the scope o=
f Theory and Applications of Categories, and will be carefully refereed fol=
lowing the standards of the journal.

The deadline for submitting the articles is December 31st, 2020.

With best regards,

Michael Johnson, Walter Tholen, Richard Wood and Marino Gran
