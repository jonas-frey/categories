This is indeed commonly accepted original inspiration; I've never heard about Eilenberg or Mac???Lane protesting against
this explanation (maybe somebody knows better?). See for example:

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory/#2

which seems a better summary of historical origins than anything you might find on wikipedia.

As regards Mathematical Reviews, while this is an interesting observation, I am not sure if it settles definitively the
question?? who and when started to see category theory as a field in its own right. There is no guarantee that the
authors of these reviews paid particular attention to terminological issues, or that they were sympathetic enough to the
goals of papers under discussion. In particular, that they shared the views of reviewed authors that mathematics needs a
new subdiscipline.

I haven't checked if the phrase "category theory" was ever used in the 1950's books of Eilenberg & Steenrod or Cartan &
Eilenberg. But Kan's 1958 paper on adjoint functors contains, by a quick count, 120 occurrences of the term "category"
on merely 36 pages and Grothendieck's 1957 T??hoku paper---over 200 (it is almost four times as large that of Kan
though). It'd seem that if you talk about a mathematical entity so much, you are developing its theory.

In fact, the 1945 paper itself does seem to suggest quite openly that a grand unifying foundational theory is the
ultimate goal. It is enough to read the final paragraphs of its intro:
