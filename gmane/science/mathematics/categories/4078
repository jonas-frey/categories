Dear colleagues,

I have had, so far, no less than 22 answers to my mail about
references for the "Beck" theorem mentioned in the Elephant, all of
them supporting Peter Johnstone. An I am not counting "references"
which "referred" to other "reliable references" such as Dusko
Pavlovic an Claudio Hermida in one of the THIRTEEN mails sent by
Marta Bunge! I intend to answer in detail to all these mails.
It might take a few days, because I don't have such a powerful team
helping me in my research: bibliography, recollections, etc.
It takes ALL of my time, 12 hours a day, but I enjoy EVERY MINUTE OF
IT. I congratulate Peter Johnstone to have such a numerous and
faithful army of supporters. But as you say in English: "The more the
merrier". So Johnstone might use the delay before my answer to find a
few dozen more supporters. It will make me even more happy, and I'm
afraid he will need ALL the support he can get!
