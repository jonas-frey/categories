The 1999 Annual Conference of the European Association for Computer
Science Logic follows previous CSL Conferences: CSL'98 (Brno, Czech
Republic), CSL'97 (Aarhus, Danemark), CSL'96 (Utrecht, Netherlands),
CSL'95 (Paderborn, Germany), CSL'94 (Kasimierz, Poland), CSL'93
(Swansea, Great Britain), CSL'92(San Miniato/Pisa, Italy), CSL'91
(Bern, CH), CSL'90 (Heidelberg, Deutchland), CSL'89 (Kaiserslautern,
Deutchland), CSL'88 (Duisburg, Deutchland), and CSL'87 (Karlsruhe,
Deutchland), CSL'99 will be held in Madrid (Spain). The event is
organized jointly by the Computer Science Departments (SIP and DACYA)
of Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

The scientific program includes 34 selected papers from among 91
submissions, five invited lectures, and two tutorials on theorem
proving and rewriting techniques, scheduled on September 24
afternoon (Friday) and September 25 morning (Saturday), immediately
after the main conference.

In addition to the scientific program, the social program includes
an excursion to Segovia (a nearby historic city), and a conference
dinner. Madrid, a city of contrasts, traditional and contemporary at
the same time, offers the opportunity to enjoy both Spain and one of
the most attractive capitals in Europe.

Scientific Programme, General Information, Registration and
Accommodation Information. The CSL'99 Web page

GENERAL INFORMATION

Place and travel

The Conference will be held in Madrid (Spain), at the Faculty of Mathematics
of Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), from the 20th to the 25th of

Ciudad Universitaria or Metropolitano) or by bus (bus lines 132, F, or 82).
The CSL'99 Web page (http://mozart.sip.ucm.es:1580/csl99/) contains
additional information such as the metropolitan network map, and the
surroundings to CSL host site map.

Social Events

A guided excursion to Segovia will be held on Wednesday, 22th. The departure
will be after lunch, at 14:00. Registered participants have this excursion
