23rd ACM International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Contro=
l
April 21-24, 2020
Sydney Australia
https://berkeleylearnverify.github.io/HSCC_2020/

Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC) 2020 is the 23rd in a series
of conferences focusing on original research on concepts, tools, and
techniques from computer science, control theory, and applied mathematics
for the analysis and control of hybrid dynamical systems with an emphasis
on computational aspects. By drawing on strategies from computation and
control, the hybrid systems field offers techniques that are applicable to
both man-made cyber-physical systems (ranging from small robots to global
infrastructure networks) and natural systems (ranging from biochemical
networks to physiological models). Papers in the conference are expected to
range over a wide spectrum of topics from theoretical results to practical
considerations, and from academic research to industrial adoption.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to

- Mathematical foundations
- Computability and complexity analysis
- Verification, validation, and testing
- Modeling paradigms and techniques
- Design, synthesis, planning, and control
- Nonlinear and safety-critical control
- Programming and specification languages
- Network science and network-based control
- Security, privacy, and resilience for cyber-physical systems with focus
on computation and control
- Autonomy, artificial intelligence and machine learning in CPS
- Design automation for CPS, including design formalisms, techniques and
tools for the above topics
- Applications and industrial case studies in: automotive, transportation,
autonomous systems, avionics, energy and power, robotics, medical devices,
manufacturing, systems and synthetic biology, models for the life sciences,
and other related areas.

SPECIAL TRACKS

This year, HSCC will have three special tracks on interdisciplinary topics
of increasing interest and importance to CPS:

(1) Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in CPS (autonomous and
semi-autonomous CPS, learning-based CPS, deep learning, intersection of
robotics/AI and CPS, etc.), and

(2) Design Automation for CPS (modeling, specification, verification,
synthesis, composition, hierarchy, languages, etc. for CPS design).

(3) Autonomy and Robotics. The submission requirements and review process
for special track papers will be the same as regular papers. The main
reason to have a special track is to broaden the HSCC pool of papers in the
direction of these topics.

PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION

HSCC invites submissions in the categories of regular papers including
special track papers (max 10 pages), and case study and tool papers (max 6
pages). We will employ a double blind reviewing process and will have a
rebuttal phase to provide authors the opportunity to reply to reviewer
concerns.

AWARDS

HSCC will have an ACM SIGBED Best Paper Award, all regular papers will be
automatically eligible for this award. HSCC will also award an "HSCC
Test-Of-Time Award". The rules for eligibility, nomination and selection of
the paper for this award can be found here. Repeatability evaluation:
Papers that pass repeatability evaluation process will receive the
"artifact evaluated" badge and there will be a Best RE Award. Best
Demo/Poster: All demos and posters accepted for presentation at HSCC=E2=80=
=9920
will be eligible for the best demo/poster award.

IMPORTANT DATES

Paper submission deadline: October 23, 2019 (AOE)

Tool paper repeatability package submission deadline: October 28, 2019 (AOE=
)

Rebuttal phase: December 4-6, 2019

Acceptance/rejection notifications: December 23, 2019 (tentative)

Poster/demo session submission: Typically mid-january (after notification)

Camera-ready: February 14, 2020

Conference dates: April 21-24, 2020

HSCC 2020 will be part of the thirteenth Cyber Physical Systems Week (CPS
Week), and co-located with the International Conference on Cyber-Physical
Systems (ICCPS), Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN), the
Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS),
Conference on Internet-of-Things Design and Implementation (IOTDI), and
related workshops.
