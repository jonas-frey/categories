SUMMER SCHOOL ON BIDIRECTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS

Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, UK
25th to 29th July 2016
http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/tlcbx/ssbx/


TOPIC

Bidirectional transformations (BX) are means of maintaining consistency 
between multiple information sources: when one source is edited, the 
others may need updating to restore consistency. BX have applications in 
databases, user interface design, model-driven development, and many other 
domains. This summer school is one of the closing activities on the 
"Theory of Least Change for BX" project at Oxford and Edinburgh 
(http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/tlcbx/). It brings together leading 
researchers in BX, spanning theory and practice, for a week of lectures in 
beautiful Oxford. It will be aimed at doctoral students in computer 
science, but will also be suitable for strong master's students and for 
researchers.


LECTURERS

Anthony Anjorin, University of Paderborn, DE
"Bx with Triple Graph Grammars"

Martin Hofmann, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, DE
"Modular Edit Lenses"

Zhenjiang Hu, National Institute of Informatics, JP
"Principles and Practice of Putback-based Bidirectional Programming in BiGUL"

Mike Johnson, Macquarie University, AU
"Mathematical Foundations of Bidirectional Transformations"

Richard Paige, University of York, UK
"Engineering Bidirectional Transformations"

The TLCBX team, Universities of Edinburgh and Oxford, UK
will introduce, say a bit about TLCBX results, and conclude


VENUE

The school will take place at Lady Margaret Hall 
(http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/) in leafy North Oxford, right next to the 
University Parks and the River Cherwell and a short walk from the City 
Centre. LMH is one of the constituent colleges of the University of 
Oxford; it was founded in 1878 as the first women's college in Oxford. Our 
lectures will take place in the splendid Simpkins Lee Theatre in the Pipe 
Partridge Building, completed in 2010.


REGISTRATION

Details to follow - please keep an eye on the webpage. The Summer School 
is financially partially supported by EPSRC, and we hope to keep costs 
low: an early registration fee of ?200 (or ?150 for students) if booked 
before the early registration deadline of 10th June, rising to ?250 (or 
?200 for students) after that point. The registration fee includes 
lunches, coffee breaks, and a banquet one evening. We have reserved 
bed-and-breakfast accommodation in college, at ?62.50 per night in an 
ensuite room, ?58 per night standard; those rooms will be released after 
the early registration deadline, after which point there will be no 
guarantee of accommodation. Space is limited; there is room for 40 
students.
