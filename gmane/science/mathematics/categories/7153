I have the following situation:

I have an adjunction F:C<->D:G such that the left adjoint F is
faithful (but not full), and I would like to characterize its
essential image. If F were full, its image would be precisely those
objects of D for which the co-unit is an isomorphism. Is there an
analogous description for the case that F is only faithful? If it
matters, in the situation I am looking at, I have a faithful functor
j:A -> B, and I am trying to characterize the essential image of its
prolongation  j_!:Psh(A) \to Psh(B). I welcome any comments.

Thank you for your time,

Dave Carchedi
