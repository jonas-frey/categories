FULLY-FUNDED DOCTORAL STUDENTSHIP
IN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AT OXFORD

I have just obtained funding for a DPhil studentship at Oxford.  The
studentship is open in terms of topic; I would welcome applications
for research in any of my areas of interest. These include:

   functional programming
   generic programming
   dependent types
   design patterns
   model-driven development

For more information about topics, please visit my web page

   http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/Jeremy.Gibbons/

or discuss with me.

The successful candidate will have a good bachelor's or master's
degree in CS, and a strong background in the principles of programming
languages.  The funding covers stipend, fees (at the home/EU rate),
equipment, and travel, and is for three and a half years from October
2010 (or as soon as possible after that).

Please do contact me with any questions, and in any case before
applying.  Please also pass this note on to anyone who might be
interested.
