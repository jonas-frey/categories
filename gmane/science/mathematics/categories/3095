I congratulate Marta for her posting, I just read Motls's

http://motls.blogspot.com/2004/11/category-theory-and-physics.html

and find it very revealing as Marta said, and more than that, I find it a
very clear exposition (by way of philosophy and by way of examples)
about what is good science and mathematicas and about what it is not.

Marta is right about that it concerns all of us category theoricist.

I will like to see here a debate about Motls's writing quoted above.

Just about this writing, NOT ABOUT Motls himself or other things he may
have done or represent !!

I do not feel capable to say something because in particular am ignorant
of physics, but many of you are not. I think in Bill for example.

So long    Eduardo Dubuc
