  21st European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
                               ETAPS 2018

                 Thessaloniki, Greece, 14-21 April 2018

                       Call for  Satellite Events


-- ABOUT ETAPS --

The European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
(ETAPS) is the primary European forum for academic and industrial
researchers working on topics relating to Software Science. It is an
annual event held in Europe each spring since 1998. Its twenty-first
edition, ETAPS 2018, will take place 14-21 April 2018 in Thessaloniki,
Greece.

ETAPS 2018 main conferences, scheduled for 16-20 April, are:

* ESOP: European Symposium on Programming
* FASE: Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering
* FOSSACS: Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures
* POST: Principles of Security and Trust
* TACAS: Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of
   Systems


-- SATELLITE EVENTS --

The ETAPS 2018 organizing committee invites proposals for satellite
events (workshops) that will complement the main conferences. They
should fall within the scope of ETAPS. This encompasses all aspects of
the system development process, including specification, design,
implementation, analysis and improvement, as well as the languages,
methodologies and tools which support these activities, covering a
spectrum from practically-motivated theory to soundly-based
practice. Satellite events provide an opportunity to discuss and
report on emerging research approaches and practical experience
relevant to theory and practice of software.

ETAPS 2018 satellite events will be held immediately before and after
the main conferences, on 14-15 April and 21 April.


-- ARRANGEMENTS FOR SATELLITE EVENTS --

The organizers of an ETAPS 2018 satellite are expected to:

* create and maintain a website for the event,
* form a PC, produce a call for papers for the event (if appropriate),
* advertise the event through specialist mailing lists etc. to
   complement the publicity of ETAPS,
* review the submissions received and make acceptance decisions,
* prepare an informal (pre)proceedings for the event (if appropriate),
* prepare the event's program complying with any scheduling
   constraints defined by the ETAPS 2018 organizing committee,
* prepare and organize the publication of a formal (post)proceedings
   (if desired).

The ETAPS 2018 organizing committee will:

* promote the event on the website and in the publicity material of
   ETAPS 2018,
* integrate the event's program into the overall program of the
   conference,
* arrange registration for the event as a component of registration
   for ETAPS,
* collect a participation fee from the registrants,
* produce a compilation USB memory stick of the informal
   (pre)proceedings of the satellite events of ETAPS 2018 and
   distribute this to the registrants,
* provide the event with a meeting room of an appropriate size, A/V
   equipment, coffee breaks and possibly lunch(es).

As a rule, ETAPS will not contribute toward the travel or accommodation
costs of invited speakers or organizers of satellite events.


-- SUBMISSION OF SATELLITE EVENT PROPOSALS --

Researchers and practitioners wishing to organize satellite events are
invited to submit proposals to the workshop co-chairs Alexander
Chatzigeorgiou <achat@uom.gr> and Nick Bassiliades
<nbassili@csd.auth.gr> using the web form at

http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/ETAPS/ .

The following information is requested:

* the name and acronym of the satellite event
* the names and contact information of the organizers
* the duration of the event: one or two days
* the preferred period: 14 April, 15 April, 14-15 April or 21 April
* the expected number of participants
* a brief description (120 words approximately) of the event topic for
   the website and publicity material of ETAPS 2018
* a brief explanation of the event topic and its relevance to ETAPS
* an explanation of the selection procedure of contributions to the
   event, the PC chair and members, if known already, information about
   past editions of the event, if applicable
* any other relevant information, like a special event format, invited
   speakers, demo sessions, special space requirements, etc.
* a tentative schedule for paper submission, notification of
   acceptance and final versions for the (informal pre-)proceedings
   (the ETAPS 2018 organizing committee will need the final files by
   the end of Feb. 2018)
* the plans for formal publication (no formal publication, formal
   proceedings ready by the event, formal post-proceedings, publication
   venue - EPTCS or elsewhere)

The proposals will be evaluated by the ETAPS 2018 organizing committee
on the basis of their assessed benefit for prospective participants of
ETAPS 2018. Prospective organizers may wish to consult the web pages
of previous satellite events as examples:

-- HOST CITY --

Thessaloniki, named after Alexander's the Great sister, is the second
largest city in Greece.  Thessaloniki is an industrial and commercial
center hosting an annual international trade fair, as well as a
transportation hub with a major modern port and an international
airport.  Thessaloniki's history spans over 2300 years. Although
largely rebuilt in modern style, Thessaloniki still retains its famous
white Byzantine walls, the 15th century White Tower, and a Venetian
citadel.  The city is famous for its many fine Byzantine churches and
Roman ruins of the triumphal arch and the palace of Emperor Galerius.
Thessaloniki is a vibrant student city hosting more than 80,000
university students and offering countless options when it comes to
local/international cuisine, cafes, music and day trips.

ETAPS 2018 is organized by the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,
the largest university in Greece.
