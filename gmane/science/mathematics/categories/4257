Oops
Email is great. I cited Peter before
he could correct himself.=20=20
A possible remedy would be to
consider not just monoids with
zero, but those equipped with a=20
homomorphism from R, so that
points are retractions of that.
This cuts down on the automorphisms,
at least the naturally available ones.
