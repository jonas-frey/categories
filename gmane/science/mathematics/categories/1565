Dear Colleagues:

The "conversions" from x/y to 1 - x + y and from x/y to x + y - xy which =
I introduced here on July 8, 2000 not only can be used across =
probability-statistics and (fuzzy) multivalued logical categories and =
ring theory and number theory categories (Fermat's Last Theorem) as =
indicated in that paper, but they are especially useful in special =
relativity and quantum field theory as well as quantum mechanics as I =
shall show here.  The categories in the latter two fields will be =
discussed in detail later, but here I would like to indicate what =
results are obtained.

Applying the conversion from x/y to 1 - x + y to the Heisenberg =
Uncertainty Principle in the form xy > k where k is a positive constant =
(x, y uncertainties in position and momentum respectively, for example, =
where notice x and y are nonnegative in the standard deviation version =
of uncertainty) yields xy =3D (x/y)y^^2 (where ^^ is exponentiation) --> =
(1 - x + y)y^^2.  For 1 - x + y < 0, which says x > 1 + y, the latter =
expression is negative, so the converted form reads: (1 - x + y)y^^2 =3D =
-/1 - x + y/y^^2 > k and therefore /1 - x + y/y^^2 < -k for k positive.  =
Since y^^2 is always nonnegative, this conditional holds trivially =
(always) provided that x > 1 + y.   Since x and y could be selected with =
exchanged physical roles (uncertainties in momentum and position =
respectively, for example), the condition that x > 1 + y is rather =
arbitrary and certainly will be fulfilled for one of the two orders in =
which x and y are defined.

The conclusion which we must come to is that there are two phases: the =
phase in which the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is satisfied (which =
phase may for example correspond to an interaction between macroscopic =
observation and microscopic phenomena) and the phase in which the =
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is not satisfied (which phrase may =
correspond to two macroscopic or two microscopic observation/phenomena =
pairs or both or some other regime).

A similar but even more explicit results holds when we make the =
conversion in special relativity in the beta or 1/beta Lorentz =
contraction factor sqrt(1 - v^^2/c^^2) where sqrt means square root of.  =
We get 1 - v^^2/c^^2 =3D 1 - (v/c)^^2 =3D 1 - y/x for y =3D v^^2, x =3D =
c^^2 and this goes over to 1 - (1 - x + y =3D x - y.   So beta or 1/beta =
(depending on what notation one uses) goes over to sqrt(x - y).  =
However, it has been pointed out in earlier papers (and it will be =
pointed out again) that the closure law holds in most of the categories =
to which these conversions x/y --> 1 - x + y for example apply, and let =
us assume the same thing here (closure under subtraction means that if x =
and y are in the category or in the set part of the category other than =
the morphism, then x - y and y - x are also in the set part).   =
Therefore, sqrt(y - x) is an alternate form of the result for beta or =
1/beta, and since sqrt (y - x) is imaginary when y < x and real when y < =
x, it must be that the real and imaginary scales are themselves =
arbitrary.  In more common terminology, they merely measure different =
phases in the sense of liquid-solid-gas etc.

Thus, not only can the speed of light be exceeded (although the object =
exceeding it enters a different phase), but the Heisenberg Uncertainty =
Principle can be violated (but the objects violating it enter different =
phases).    This is not surprising in view of the superluminal group =
velocity results obtained in 1997 and later experiments by Nimtz in =
Cologne/Koln and Berkeley and elsewhere (which according to Nimtz are =
also applicable to ordinary velocities).  It is also not surprising in =
view of M. Jammer's comprehensive analysis (The Philosophy of Quantum =
Mechanics, Wiley: New York 1974) of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle =
in which it is found that the principle does not apply to individual =
measurements of physical objects but to statistical summaries of their =
uncertainties (Schrodinger in fact proved that on Hilbert Space =
self-adjoint operators obey this inequality for the product of their =
uncertainties, but Banach Space is far more general than Hilbert Space =
and gives enough room by far to define or contain a second phase sets of =
objects - which may not be operators in the usual sense).

The implications for special relativity and for quantum field theory =
(which combines quantum mechanics with special relativity) are obviously =
serious, although not necessarily catastrophic.   It just means that =
these theories are again approximations to one or two states or category =
of states of physical objects but not to more general or different =
categories of states of physical objects.  Since light itself satisfies =
both categories (sqrt (1 -(c^^2/c^^2)) is 0 which can be regarded as =
both real and imaginary), there certainly is at least one non-empty =
element in each category.
