Dear all,

I'd just like to point out that a quick google search of "category theory
evil" gives the correct definition, from the nLab page. As long as articles
are referenced properly, this is a non-issue. Moreover, frequently people
define things in papers which remain unused outside that one article - as
long as everything is clear, there is no problem here. With regards the
original problem, that evil is a poor choice, I personally see little point
in changing a word no one would be offended by.
