Dear colleagues,

You can find in the following site
http://www.math.mcgill.ca/bunge/abstracts.ps
the abstracts of the Oberwolfach Meeting on Descent from 1995.

Look in particular at the abstract for Jack Duskin's lecture on "Triples and
Descent". In it, Jack gives as a corollary to the main theorem what he calls
"the Benabou-Roubaud-Beck theorem". Jack mentions that the theorems exposed
in that lecture were part of a thesis project of his student M. Alsani.

There seems to be a precedent in print then in adding Beck's name to this
theorem, unlike what I previously thought.  Other authors (like Claudio
Hermida) refer to it as "the Beck-Benabou-Roubaud theorem". This, added to
the recollections by Ross Street and Bill Lawvere, seem to contradict my
previous contention (from lack of evidence) that the theorem is exclusively
due to Benabou and Roubaud. It seems now clear that Jon Beck must have had
it (independently) too, which of course is not at all surprising.


With best wishes,
Marta
