You seem to be shifting uncertainly between the category where colimits
may or may not exist and a category (e.g. Set or a topos) that provides
an ambient logic for your mathematics.

Do you assume that 2 has all colimits? (Then the proof for the halting
problem says take the colimit of the diagram H: ?? -> 2. You've
parameterized that by x and y for program and data, but the essence of
the argument can be seen even without those.) Or even those colimits of
the specific form H? If so, then you are using a logical principle of
your ambient mathematics, not pure category theory.

"Indiscrete" means for each pair of objects x, y, there is a unique
morphisms from x to y. From your definition on p.4, 2 is not indiscrete,
since there is no morphism 1 -> 0. From the definition on p.14, ??_i is
indiscrete. Suppose you have a functor H: ??_i -> 2.
For any n you have H(0 -> n): H(0) -> H(n) and H(n -> 0): H(n) -> H(0).
Hence, by antisymmetry in the poset 2, H(n) = H(0). What you are saying
in words is captured by a functor from ?? (poset) to 2, not from ??_i to 2.

Steve.
