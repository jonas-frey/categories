CALL FOR PAPERS

Second Workshop on
MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
6 July 2008,  Reykjavik - Iceland
A satellite workshop of ICALP 2008

PRESENTATION
The workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming is=20
devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a=20
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on=20
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in=20
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of=20
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of remarkable=20
power and abstraction. Monadic programming in Haskell is the=20
paradigmatic example, but there are many more mathematical insights=20
manifest in programs and in programming language design:=20
Freyd-categories in reactive programming, symbolic differentiation=20
yielding context structures, and comonadic presentations of dataflow, to=20
name but three. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to=20
reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.

The first MSFP workshop was held in Kuressaare, Estonia, in July 2006.=20
An associated special issue of the Journal of Functional Programming is=20
in preparation.

SUBMISSIONS
Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science have provisionally=20
agreed to publish the proceedings of MSFP 2008. ENTCS require=20
submissions in LaTeX, formatted according to their guidelines=20
(http://www.entcs.org/prelim.html).

Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted=20
concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. Programme=20
Committee members, barring the co-chairs, may (and indeed are encouraged=20
to) contribute. Accepted papers must be presented at the workshop by one=20
of the authors.

There is no specific page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.

We are using the EasyChair software to manage submissions.
To submit a paper, please log in at:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmsfp2008.

TIMELINE:
Submission of abstracts: 4 April
Submission of papers: 11 April
Notification: 16 May
Final versions due: 13 June
Workshop: 6 July
