Workshop on  Computer Algebra Methods and Commutativity of Algebraic Diag=
rams

IRIT, Toulouse  (France)
October 2009


*** FIRST CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ***
*** AND ***
*** PAPERS ***

Categorical diagrams have multiple applications
in mathematics (algebra, topology) and computer science
(models and metamodels, rewriting systems, higher order
languages). Diagrams (understood less strictly) can be found
in physics, chemistry and other scientific domains.
One meets many similar problems in
computer-assisted treatment of diagrams in all these
domains concerning algorithms, graphic interfaces,
interaction with systems of computer algebra and
other software. In spite of importance of diagrammatic
methods, they are relatively little developped
and underrepresented in the world of computer-assisted
reasoning.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers working on
these subjects, to assess the current state of the art and
identify open problems and future research directions.

The main topics may be listed (non-exhaustively) as follows:
algorithms that may be used in computer-assisted treatment of diagrams,
treatment of diagrams in existing computer algebra systems,
formal developments related to diagrams and
category theory in proof-assistants,
user interfaces and graphics for categorical diagrams.

There will be space for talks presenting original work,
work in progress, applications, survey of previous works.
We plan to provide sufficient time for discussions. Details on
paper submission will be given in a further announcement.

Papers presented at the workshop will be published on the
web site of the workshop and may be selected for submission,
in complete and revised form, to a special issue of an
international journal, in case their number and quality
justify it.
