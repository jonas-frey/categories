I now have available a 9-month post-doctoral research fellow position =
for research on the computational interpretation of homotopy type =
theory.  I am looking for someone with a strong background in =
intuitionistic type theory and mechanized reasoning, and will prefer =
candidates with computer science credentials over those without.  The =
foundation of the project is described at =
http://www.homotopytypetheory.org, and in particular the monograph =
mentioned therein.

The official job posting is attached for your reference.  It is intended =
that the successful candidate would begin work at the start of the fall =
semester at Carnegie Mellon, and continue for the academic year, but =
some small flexibility may be possible, with the permission of the =
funding agency.

This project is funded by the National Science Foundation under grant =
number CCF-1116703.

Professor, Computer Science
