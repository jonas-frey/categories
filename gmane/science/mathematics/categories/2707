CTCS'04 is the 10th Conference on Category Theory and Computer Science,
with the purpose to advance the foundations of computing using the =20
tools of category theory.

Invited Speakers for the CTCS 2004 Conference:

      * Francois Bergeron (Queb=E9c)
      * Martin Hyland (Cambridge)
      * Robin Milner (Cambridge)
      * Andrew Pitts (Cambridge)
      * Thomas Streicher (Darmstadt)

Typical topics at CTCS include category-theoretic aspects of the =20
following:

coalgebras and computing
concurrent and distributed systems
constructive mathematics
declarative programming and term rewriting
domain theory and topology
foundations of computer security
linear logic
modal and temporal logics
models of computation
program logics, data refinement, and specification
programming language semantics
type theory

Previous conferences have been held in Guildford (Surrey), Edinburgh =20
(twice),
Manchester, Paris, Amsterdam, Cambridge, S. Margherita Ligure (Genova), =20=

and
Ottawa.

CTCS 2004 PhD SUMMER SCHOOL

The summer school is aimed at both graduate and undergraduate students, =20=

with basic
knowledge of category theory. The school will offer mini-courses (5 =20
lectures each) in:

      * Stone Duality, Coalgebras, and Modal Logic (Alexander Kurz)
      * Game Semantics (Guy McCusker)
      * Operational Semantics (Pawel Sobocinski)
      * Categorical Models for Concurrency (Thomas Hildebrandt)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

CMCIM 2004 WORKSHOP

In between the summer school and the CTCS conference, August 11th,
there will be an informal half-day workshop on Categorical Methods in
Concurrency, Interaction and Mobility.

The workshop has previously been held in connection with
CONCUR 2002 and CONCUR 2003.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts (less than 5 pages),
presenting status reports, recent results, challenges or work in
progress. There will be no formal proceedings of the workshop,
informal proceedings will be distributed at the workshop. Thus,
accepted material may be published elsewhere at a later date.

Workshop participation is FREE, but requires registration before 1st
of July. Submissions should be sent before 21th of June.
