Dear Peter=2C Dear David=2C Dear All=2C

I was going to reply=2C but was too busy with non-mathematical things at th=
e moment (a big move). =A0

The following are the papers relevant to David's question=2C beginning with=
 the one that Peter mentions:

M. C. Bunge=2C=A0Classifying toposes and fundamental localic groupoids=2Cin=
: Category Theory 1991=2C CMS Conference Procedings 13=2C American Mathemat=
ical Society (1992)=2C 75-96.=A0
M. C. Bunge=2C=A0Universal Covering Localic Toposes=2CComptes Rendues Socie=
te Royale du Canada 24 (1992)=2C 245-250.
M. C. Bunge and I.Moerdijk=2COn the construction of the Grothendieck fundam=
ental group of a topos by paths=2CJ. Pure and Applied Algebra 116 (1997)=2C=
 99-113.=A0

Comments will have to wait=2C I'm afraid.=A0

Cordial regards=2C
