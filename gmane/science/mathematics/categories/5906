Dear Marco,

We could use of the dotted-equality symbol only when the=20
canonical isomorphism under consideration is part of
a contractible network of isomorphisms. The network does
not need to be explicitly identified if the context is clear enough.=20


For example, the dotted equality

(A times B)times C =3D. A times (B times C)

is refering to the associativity constraint.
The dotted equality

  A times B =3D. B times A

is refering to the symmetry constraint. But
the dotted equality

  A times A =3D. A times A

is ambiguous and should be excluded (actually, it
is not ambiguous, since the identity of A times A
is denoted  A times A =3D A times A ).

I am proposing a rule of thumb, not a new formalism.
Mathematics is as much an art as it is an exact science.

Best,
Andr=E9

Dear Peter,

Isn't this very dangerous?

1. First, I think you are referring to some (specified) *coherent*
(contractible) system of isomorphisms,
otherwise you can easily prove that 1 =3D - 1 (see an example below).

2. Even in that case, we know that coherence can be a delicate thing.
Let us take the cartesian product in Set (or the tensor product in a
symmetric monoidal category).
Would you write XxY =3D. YxX for the symmetry isomorphism s?
Then by XxX =3D. XxX do you mean s or the identity?
For XxXxX =3D. XxXxX we have six permutations of variables, generated
by sxX and Xxs; and so on.
I hope nobody will suggest some complicated trick to account for this;
transpositions and permutations are already there, known to
everybody; but we have to name them.


3. Coming back to point 1, "canonical" isomorphisms need not be
coherent.
There are a lot of such situations; I like to refer to the induced
isomorphisms in homological algebra,
because much of my early work was linked with that.
