                               CiE 2006
                     Computability in Europe 2006 :
              Logical Approaches to Computational Barriers
                         30 June - 5 July 2006
                          Swansea University
                   http://www.cs.swansea.ac.uk/cie06/

                        2nd  CALL  FOR  PAPERS

                       Deadline: JANUARY 6, 2006

CiE 2006 is the second of a new conference series on
Computability Theory and related topics which started in
Amsterdam in 2005.  CiE 2006 will focus on (but not be limited
to) logical approaches to computational barriers:
- practical and feasible barriers, e.g., centred around the P vs.
  NP problem;
- computable barriers connected to models of computers and
  programming languages;
- hypercomputable barriers related to physical systems.

Tutorials:
   Samuel R. Buss (San Diego, CA)
   Julia Kempe (Paris)

Invited Speakers:
   Jan Bergstra (Amsterdam)
   Luca Cardelli (Microsoft Cambridge)
   Martin Davis (New York, NY)
   John W Dawson (York, PA) (Special Address on Kurt Goedel)
   Jan Krajicek (Prague)
   Elvira Mayordomo Camara (Zaragoza)
   Istvan Nemeti (Budapest)
   Helmut Schwichtenberg (Munich)
   Andreas Weiermann (Utrecht)

Special Sessions:
   Proofs and Computation
   Computable Analysis
   Challenges in Complexity
   Foundations of Programming
   Mathematical Models of Computers and Hypercomputers
   Goedel Centenary: His Legacy for Computability

The Programme Committee cordially invites all researchers
(European and non-European) in the area of Computability Theory
to submit their papers (in PDF-format, max 10 pages) for
presentation at CiE 2006.  We particularly invite papers that
build bridges between different parts of the research community.
Since women are underrepresented in mathematics and computer
science, we emphatically encourage submissions by female authors.

The proceedings will be published within Springer's LNCS series.

To submit a paper and for more information on the submission
process, go to our web site http://www.cs.swansea.ac.uk/cie06/

Important dates:

Submission Deadline:           January 6th, 2006.
Notification of Authors:         March 3rd, 2006.
Deadline for Final Version:     March 24th, 2006.

(Please note that the dates have changed.)
