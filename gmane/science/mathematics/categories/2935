Continuation of namings

(1) -  Is there a standard name for the squares where the canonical map=20=

is monic , i.e. the pair of maps A --->B  and  A --->C is jointly =20
monic. I propose semi-pullback

(2)- In most cases the canonical map being epic is not what one really=20=

wants. Of course Joyal assumes the category where the maps live to be a=20=

pre-topos, then it's enough, otherwise one cannot "compose" such=20
squares.  Do we have to rename the squares where the canonical map is a=20=

universal epi, or those where its a universal regular epi?

In view of (1), one would like to say that a square is a pullback iff=20
it is both a quasi and semi pullback
