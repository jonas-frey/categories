From: john baez <baez@math.ucr.edu>

In their book "Homotopy invariant structures on topological structures",
Boardman and Vogt construct from any topological operad O a new one WO,
which can be thought of as a "weakened" version of O in which all the
laws of O now hold only up to homotopy in a coherent way.  

Has there been any subsequent work clarifying this construction?  Here
I'm not interested so much in all the *other* approaches to infinite
loop space machines, as in the notion of "weakening" a topological
operad.  For example, Boardman and Vogt point out that their construction
can be used to discuss homotopy colimits, which makes me wonder if the
construction of WO from O could be done slickly using homotopy colimits.
Has anyone discussed this?

Best,
John Baez
