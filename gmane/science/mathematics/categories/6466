Dear Jean,

you (and all other categories list readers) are welcome to add as much
material on category theory of any sort as you see fit to the nLab.

http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage

the input is no harder than writing in (La)TeX. For example, the page

http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck+fibration

deals with fibrations from several different points of view, but if
you see fit to expand it, I (and I assume others) would be very
pleased.

Or you could start some new topics at

http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Jean+Benabou

and I'm sure the nLab regulars will pitch in and lend a hand. As far
as actively discussing these ideas go, there is the nForum

http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/

where it is a simple matter to sign up. In all events, the discussions
there are public and open for all to read.

Best wishes, and good luck for what sounds like a very interesting lecture,

David Roberts
