Hi=2C Emily and Fred
This definition of finiteness can be extended to a definition of smallness.
Double dualisation and coadequacy monads have a big overlap=2Crelated to
the Isbell conjugacy between Csheaves and Calgebras where  C is a given
category. Instead of taking C to consist only of 2 and 3 element sets=2Cas =
in the=20
Stone case=2C let C be a full category of countable sets and ask if C is co=
adequate
among all sets. Then the fixed algebras for the resulting monad are small i=
n the=20
sense of being smaller than the UlamTarski number. That they are sufficient=
ly big=20
for all reasonable constructions of geometry and analysis concentrates in t=
he fact
that they are closed under the formation of Hurewicz exponentials=2C ie tha=
t their
  category is Cartesian closed=2C indeed a topos (the subobject classifier i=
s tautological
since it is in C). It would be desirable to have a general proof of this fa=
ct.
         The intuitions connected with historical cases of Mcompleteness req=
uire that.=20
M is already idempotent=2C ie does not cry out for transfinite iteration. T=
hus indeed
a suggestive and appropriate name for these fixed algebras is needed.
