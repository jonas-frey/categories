This division of categories into left, right, and other caters for only
a very special case of the general phenomenon "signature of opposite is
complement of signature", namely where *all* the algebra is on the right,
call this C\op.  The more general situation permits the algebra to be
split between C and C\op, e.g. CSLat which puts the sups (say) in C and
sends the infs off to C\op, which turn into sups as they "pass through
the mirror."  Many other partitions of algebra are possible that similarly
do not fit this left-right classification and so fall under "other".
