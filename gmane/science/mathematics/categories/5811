A few thoughts about terminology.

Categories are tradidionally named according to the nature
of their objects, not the nature of their morphisms.=20
We say "the category of sets" not "the category of functions".=20
This convention is not respected in the case where the category=20
has only one object: we call it a monoid, not because it is a=20
mono-object category (maybe we should) but because it has only one=20
binary operation in contrast with a ring.=20
Like monoids, operads are collections of abstract operations
closed under composition. Classical operads have
only one object, one color. But multi-colored operads
are often called muti-categories, especially when they are big.=20

A set is a discrete homotopy type, a 0-type.
This why I like to give the category of sets rank 0.
I like to denote the quasi-category of n-types by U[n].


Best,
Andr=E9

Not at all. It may be was not a good example. A better example would be
categories. If we follow the principle "foo =3D 1 foo" and want to agree
with historical low dimensional terminology we should call categories
2-sets. Set =3D 1 Set. So, categories =3D 2 Set. Nobody will do it I =
guess.
There are many other examples like stack, gerbes and so on. I agree with
Mike Shulman that this is a byproduct of categorification. But we can
survive with it.
