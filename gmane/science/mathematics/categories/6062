ACM Symposium on Applied Computing

The ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has gathered scientists
from different areas of computing over the past twenty-five years. The
forum represents an opportunity to interact with different communities
sharing an interest in applied computing.

SAC 2011 is sponsored by SIGAPP and will be hosted by Tunghai
University, TaiChung, Taiwan.


Software Verification and Testing Track

We invite authors to submit new results in formal verification and
testing, as well as development of technologies to improve the usability
of formal methods in software engineering. Also welcome are detailed
descriptions of applications of mechanical verification to large scale
software. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

- tools and techniques for verification of large scale software systems
- real world applications and case studies applying software verification
- static and run-time analysis
- abstract interpretation
- model checking
- theorem proving
- correct by construction development
- model-based testing
- verification-based testing
- symbolic execution
- analysis methods for dependable systems
- software certification and proof carrying code


Submissions guidelines

Paper submissions must be original, unpublished work. Submissions should
be in electronic format, via the START site:
https://www.softconf.com/b/sac11-tp/. Author(s) name(s) and address(es)
must not appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference should be
avoided and made in the third person. Submitted paper will undergo a
blind review process. Authors of accepted papers should submit an
editorial revision of their papers that fits within six two-column pages
(an extra two pages, to a total of eight pages, may be available at a
charge). Please comply to this page limitation already at submission
time. Publication of accepted articles requires the commitment of one of
the authors to register for the conference and present the paper.
Accepted papers will be published in the ACM SAC 2011 proceedings.
