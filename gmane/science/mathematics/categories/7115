Hi
``Cartesian bicategories II'' by A. Carboni, G.M. Kelly, R.F.C. Walters,
and R.J. Wood in TAC Vol. 19, 2008, No. 6, pp 93-124, gives the details
showing that a bicategory with bicategorical finite products has a
canonical symmetric monoidal structure. (This is used there to show that
a cartesian bicategory also has a canonical symmetric monoidal structure.)
Best regards, Richard
