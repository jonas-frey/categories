Recently I posted this question

https://mathoverflow.net/q/277582/41291

to mathoverflow and now it occurred to me that most likely I can get a
quick answer here.

Are there geometric morphisms f: YY -> XX which are

(1) locally but not globally bounded, or
(2) locally but not globally presheaf, or
(3) as in (2) and bounded?

In more detail, I mean this: there must be an object X in XX with
global support (X->1 epic) such that the pullback f/X: YY/f^*(X) -> XX/X
is

(1) bounded, while f is not bounded, or
(2) equivalent over XX/X to the topos (XX/X)^{CC^op} of internal
presheaves on some internal category CC of XX/X, while YY is not
equivalent to any such over XX, or
(3) same as (2) and in addition f bounded.

Can any of these happen?

Hoping,
Mamuka
