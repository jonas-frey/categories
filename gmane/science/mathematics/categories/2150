I don't remember the original context, so I don't know who's right,
but the answer depends on what sort of real number e could be.
It can't be 0, for example, so what can it be?

* If e > 0, then work with 1/e and use the Archimedean property;
  Bishop would recognise and accept this proof.
* But if you only know that e <= 0 is false,
  then you need Markov's principle to deduce e > 0.
