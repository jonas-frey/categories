In answer to Pat Donaly

The connection between group actions and groupoids has been known and=20
extensively used for a long time. It was realized by Charles Ehresmann in=20
the early fifties. In fact Charles came to categories from groupoids, and=20
to groupoids from group actions and from pseudogroups of transformations.

In particular, in his works on fibre bundles and Differential Geometry, he=
=20
associated a groupoid to a pseudogroup of transformations (1), then=20
considered action of groupoids of jets as extending group actions (2).

In the paper (3) he introduces topological and differentiable categories=20
(i.e., internal to Top and to Diff), in view of associating to a principal=
=20
bundle H a particular topological groupoid P (called a locally trivial=20
groupoid). He then finds the locally trivial bundles associated to H as the=
=20
spaces on which there is an (internal) action of this groupoid. Given a=20
topological space F with an action of a sub-group of P, he constructs such=
=20
a space with fibre F by an "enlargement"  process he had defined in his=20
important paper (4).

These results and many others can be found in the series of papers=20
reprinted in "Charles Ehresmann : Oeuvres completes et commentees" (more=20
specially in Part I), 1980-83..
