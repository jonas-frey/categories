Equivalence of categories in practice is highly non symmetric. Usually
one direction is defined and canonical, and the other is choice
dependent and as such they are many of them. A definition of equivalence
should reflect this fact, thus, it is not "a pair of functors such etc
etc", but, either "A FUNCTOR full and faithful and essentially
surjective", or "A FUNCTOR such that there exist a quasi inverse" if you
do not want to use choice.
