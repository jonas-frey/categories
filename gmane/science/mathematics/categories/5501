Dear Paul,

I must mention that it is not me, but Jacques Penon who has worked on =20
"locally internal" notions.

I would like to add (to my yesterday mail) some indications on what I =20
have called "small categories theory". In fact, this theory begins to =20
exist. It is, for instance, what is called the "higher dimensionnal =20
words problem", but also a developpement on higher automata theory (I =20
have made many talks on this subjet, but not published --- I can send =20
a manuscript to anybody interested). I have for example proved that =20
finite and finitary Lawvere theory are finitely presentable 2-mono=EFds =20
(it is my motivation for introducing the notion of polygraphs, =20
previously introduced by Ross Street under the name of computads). It =20
is perhaps not well-known by the categorists because it is published =20
in a computer sciences revue :
