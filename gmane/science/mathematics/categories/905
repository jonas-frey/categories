Re: Mike Barr's question concerning two equivalent definitions
    of a class of categories

    Since the term 'additive' had already been established to refer
to the special case where the homs are abelian groups, I called 
these 'linear categories' in my paper

    Categories of Space and of Quantity
    in The Space of Mathematics, Philosophical, Epistemological
    and Historical Explorations, de Gruyter, Berlin (1992) pp 14-30

because 'linear' is a term well known to engineers, statisticians and
others, and because these categories form the natural environment for
applications of Linear Algebra.  Of course, the entries in the matrices
are in general maps, not necessarily scalars, although scalars for which
the addition is idempotent are an important special case. (Here by the 
scalars of such a category I mean the elements of the rig which is its
center.) 
	In that paper I referred to what I believe is the first reference
to this theory, namely Saunders Mac Lane's 1950 paper

     Duality for Groups, Bull AMS vol 56, pp 485-516, (1950)

expounding work he did in the late 40's.
