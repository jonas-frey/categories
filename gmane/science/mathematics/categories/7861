Indeed this was done in the Thesis of Nancy J. McCracken in 1979
supervised by John Reynolds. Its title is

   An investigation of programming languages with a polymorphic type
   structure.

Cardelli and Wegner got interested in this in the mid 1980s. There are
2 paper on this one can find on the web

Cardelli & Wegner  On Understanding Types Data Abstraction and Polymorphism
                    Computing Surveys, Vol.17 (1985)

Cardelli  A Polymorphic Lambda Calculus with Type:Type
           a DEC report from 1986

That's what I have wrung out of my beard
