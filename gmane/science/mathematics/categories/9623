BACKGROUND

Established in 2004 by the International Institute for Software
Technology of the United Nations University (UNU-IIST), the ICTAC
conference series aims at bringing together researchers and
practitioners from academia, industry and government to present
research and exchange ideas and experience addressing challenges in
both theoretical aspects of computing and the exploitation of theory
through methods and tools for system development. ICTAC also aims to
promote research cooperation between developing and industrial
countries.


SCOPE

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:

* Languages and automata
* Semantics of programming languages
* Logic in computer science
* Lambda calculus, type theory and category theory
* Domain-specific languages
* Theories of concurrency and mobility
* Theories of distributed, grid and cloud computing
* Models of objects and components
* Coordination models
* Models of software architectures
* Timed, hybrid, embedded and cyber-physical systems
* Static analysis
* Software verification
* Software testing
* Program generation and transformation
* Model checking and automated theorem proving
* Interactive theorem proving
* Verified software, formalized programming theory


SUBMISSION OF CONTRIBUTIONS

We solicit full-length research papers reporting original research
contributions.  Submissions must adhere to the LNCS format and must
not exceed 18 pages (excluding bibliography of maximum 2 pages).

Submissions must not have been published or be under consideration for
publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis of
originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation
quality, and relevance to the conference.

Submission is through Easychair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac2018

One author of each accepted paper must attend the conference to present
it, having paid the regular registration fee.


PROCEEDINGS

The proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series.


BEST PAPER AWARD

Springer is sponsoring a best paper award.


SPECIAL ISSUE

After the conference, authors of the best contributions are invited to
submit a revised and extended version to a special issue, to be
published in Elsevier's Theoretical Computer Science.

The city of Stellenbosch, founded 1685, is the second oldest European
settlement in South Africa after Cape Town. It is situated about 50 km
to the east of Cape Town. It is the place to admire Cape Dutch
architecture and the heart of the Cape Winelands, South Africa's prime
wine region. Stellenbosch University is one of the leading universities
in Africa.
