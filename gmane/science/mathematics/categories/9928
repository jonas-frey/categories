Call for papers

The 14th International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and
Systems (CRiSIS)
29-31 October 2019, Hammamet, Tunisia

http://crisis2019.redcad.org

The International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems
2019 will be the 14th in a series dedicated to security issues in
Internet-related applications, networks and systems. Internet has become
essential for the exchange of information between user groups and
organizations from different backgrounds and with different needs and
objectives. These users are exposed to increasing risks regarding security
and privacy, due to the development of more and more sophisticated online
attacks, the growth of Cyber Crime, etc. Attackers nowadays do not lack
motivation and they are more and more experienced. To make matters worse,
for performing attacks have become easily accessible. Moreover, the
increasing complexity as well as the immaturity of new technologies such as
pervasive, mobile and wireless devices and networks, raise new security
challenges.

In this context, new security mechanisms and techniques should be deployed
to achieve an assurance level acceptable for critical domains such as
energy, transportation, health, defence, banking, critical infrastructures,
embedded systems and networks, avionics systems, etc. The CRiSIS conference
offers a remarkable forum for computer and network security actors from
industry, academia and government to meet, exchange ideas and present
recent advances on Internet-related security threats and vulnerabilities,
and on the solutions that are needed to counter them.

the time of the conference.

Maximum paper length will be 16 printed pages for full papers or 6 pages
for short papers, in LNCS style (
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). Authors of accepted papers
must guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. All
paper submissions will be handled through the EasyChair conference
management system: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcrisis2019
