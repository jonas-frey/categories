*************************************************************
Midlands Graduate School 2013 in the Foundations of Computing
*************************************************************

The Midlands Graduate School is taking place

8 - 12 April 2013 at the University of Leicester, UK.

http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/mgs2013/

The School provides an intensive course of lectures on the Foundations
of Computing. It is very well established, having run annually for
10 years, and has always proved a popular and successful event.
This year we have Philip Wadler, University of Edinburgh, as guest lecturer.

Natasha Alechina,   Modal Logic
Venanzio Capretta,  Coalgebras and Infinite Data Structures
Paul Levy, Typed Lambda-Calculus
Brian Logan, Multi-agent programming
Uday Reddy, Category Theory
Eike Ritter, Security and applied pi-calculus
Georg Struth, Kleene Algebra
Rick Thomas, Formal Languages and Group Theory
Philip Wadler, tba

The lectures are aimed at graduate students, typically in their first
or second year of study for a PhD. However, the school is open to
anyone who is interested in learning more about mathematical computing
foundations.

Early registration fee will be approximately 500 GBP, including
accommodation and full board. Details will be announced in January, but
we already welcome expressions of interest to mgs.le.2013@gmail.com
