Does "equi-unstable" have enough relevant content for you?
Or do any of the proposals so far have enough relevant content
for you?  (I mean the pithy proposals contained in Joyal's list;
there is always the longer "non-invariant under equivalence".)

The quotation above seems to effectively summarize what the
rant is all about; I think I can do without the judgment or
projection that I or anyone else is taking "dictation from God".

Yes, let's. I look forward to other suggestions as well.

Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't much care for it
if it merely evokes skeletal subcategories -- that is only
one application of the concept we're discussing.

Do you have a positive contribution you'd like to make,
Paul?
