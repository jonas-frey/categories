Dear Thomas,

I am a bit surprised that you, of all people, should defend cleavages, =
i.e. indexed categories. As far as I remember, there not many of them in =
the notes you wrote on Fibered categories a la Benabou.
I remind you that these notes were written not only after lectures I =
gave, but after long conversations we had, many times, in my flat, and =
also a few days you spent in my house in the south of France, where, for =
at least 10 hours everyday I explained in detail to you my work on =
fibered categories and corrected many mistakes you made in first drafts  =
of that paper.
Nevertheless, for the sake of the people on the category list,to whom =
this message is also addressed, I shall answer your questions an =
remarks.

Let  p: X --> S be a surjective group homomorphism. It is a fibration, =
and a cleavage is a section of p (in Set). This was explicitly noted by =
Grothendieck more than 50 years ago!=20
Does such a  p come equipped with a cleavage? Take for p the morphim :  =
R --> R/Z  of the reals on the circle. Suppose I were to teach periodic =
functions, i.e functions with domain R which factor through R/Z. =
Wouldn't it be ridiculous to use a section of p ? Which one by the way?

Take the theorem : The composite of two fibrations is a fibration. Does =
it need cleavages, i.e. AC for classes, to be proved? Of course, if you =
are cleavage fan, as you seem to be, you can add that, given cleavages =
of p and q one gets an associated cleavage of  pq.

Let's look at an important example,namely categories S with pull backs, =
not with choice of pull backs mind you. This is a first order notion, =
saying that : for every cospan of S there exists a universal span making =
the obvious square commutative.
Then, without AC, you can prove that the functor  Codom: S^2 --> S  is a =
fibration. And again, if you are cleavage happy, add that a cleavage of =
this fibration, if it exists, (I'm not assuming AC)  is a choice of =
pullbacks in S.

I could multiply the examples. But let's look at an important question. =
Suppose you prove an intrinsic result about fibrations, using cleavages, =
in principle you'd have to see what happens when you change cleavages. =
And don't wave your hands and tell me that, for formal 2-categorical =
reasons, the result is obvious. I'll believe you only when you write a =
precise metatheorem which covers ALL the cases.
You are convinced, and I am convinced, and everybody is convinced that =
such a metatheorem is not necessary. But that is NOT A PROOF !  And why =
are you convinced? Because, even if you say the contrary, deep in your =
mind you KNOW that intrinsic properties of fibrations AND cartesian =
functors should not refer to cleavages. Let me insist on the fact that =
the mythic metatheorem should also cover cartesian functors  F: X --> X' =
where you change the cleavages of both X and X'

Of course the theorem I mentioned in my mail on pre foliations, applies =
to fibrations and gives new results in that case. But this theorem is =
true for  F: X --> X'  where X is a prefoliation hence, even with AC, =
has no cleavage, and X' is an arbitrary category over S, i.e. has even =
less cleavages than X.

In order not to make this mail too long I have not, but I should have, =
mentioned internalization where cleavages are even more problematic.

Best to all,
Jean
