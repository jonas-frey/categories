Gregory Maxwell Kelly was one of the great mathematicians of our time, so
perfect in his research and vision of mathematics, and in every aspect of
academic life. And he was so exceptionally kind to everyone. It is hard to
imagine that Max is not with us anymore, and it is a great pain for his
family and for all of us, his friends and colleagues...
