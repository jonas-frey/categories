Dear Bob, Thorsten and Dusko,

I thank you for expressing frankly your position.

You seems to suggest that this is a debate between pure and applied =
category theorists.
I disagree to the extend that "quantum foundation" and "quantum =
information"=20
are very speculative subjects. The "Foundational Question Institute",

http://www.fqxi.org/

which is known to support speculative research projects exclusively,
is funding a project on Quantum Foundation by Bob Coecke:=20

http://www.fqxi.org/grants/large/awardees/view/__details/2008/coecke

It has funded a project called "Topos Quantum Theory" by Christopher =
Isham

http://www.fqxi.org/grants/large/awardees/view/__details/2006/isham

It is funding a project "Categorifying Fundamental Physics" by John =
Baez:=20

http://www.fqxi.org/grants/large/awardees/view/__details/2008/baez

Physics is in bad shape today according to Lee Smolin:

http://www.amazon.ca/Trouble-Physics-String-Theory-Science/dp/061891868X/=


His main critic is that string theory has lost contact with experiments. =

It has become an academically driven discipline.
Maybe we should stop calling it physics.=20
Of course, it can be interesting mathematically.=20
In mathematics, the word "quantum" is often used as a prefix to express =
some vague
connection to quantum physics, like non-commutative algebras and Feynman =
diagrams.
By itself it is no proof that the named notion is fitting something in =
the natural world.
There are quantum groups, quantum algebras, quantum Grassmanians,
quantum planes, quantum bundles, quantum Schubert cells, quantum =
cohomology theories,
quantum fields, quantum Yan-Baxter operators, etc.
The theory of quantum groups is mathematically very interesting
but it has no applications that I know to real quantum physics:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_group

I have a Phd student working on quantum quasi-shuffle algebras
and he needs not to know about quantum physics because it is irrelevant.

The notion of dagger compact closed category is interesting
and purely mathematical, like the notion of quantum group.


Quantum information science is also quite speculative:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Information_Science
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer

Again, there is nothing wrong with highly speculative research.
So the present debate is not about real applications of category theory.

Feynam introduced his diagram as a method for computing the solutions
of QED field equations. It is essentially a technique for enumerating=20
the terms arising in perturbation theory.  The method was extended to =
all physical fields
and Penrose understood the connection between the diagrams and tensor =
calculus.=20
The geometry of tensor calculus is just an abstraction of this =
connection.
Feynman diagrams are very useful in physics and mathematics.
But the mystery of quantum physics lies elsewere: the extraction of a=20
probability distribution from the complex values of a wave function.
I dont think that a categorical formalism based on Feynman diagrams=20
is very different from what the physicists are currently doing.
This maybe why your formalism is having a moderate success among the =
physicists.
Of course, a good formalism can stimulate new developements.
But it should not be presented as radically new if it is not.
Too much hype may backfire. It is not good  for the reputation of =
category theory.


Happy New Year to all!

Best,
Andr=E9
