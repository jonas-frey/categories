Specifically, you use ~trademark~ law, rather than ~copyright~ law,
to do this.  So a practical question in the case of the name "Topology"
is whether Elsevier claims it as their trademark as a journal title.
(They don't have to mark it on the cover to do this, although it helps;
trademarks often aren't legally identified until the litigation begins.)
Note that such a meaningful and relevant (not arbitrary and fanciful) name
is harder to trademark at all, but history and recognition help.
