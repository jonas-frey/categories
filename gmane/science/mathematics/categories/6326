In something I've been thinking about recently, the condition
on a simplicial set that all faces of non-degenerate simplices
are non-degenerate seems to play a significant role. Does anyone
know whether this condition has been considered previously, and
if so whether it has a standard name?

The condition is of course satisfied by those simplicial sets
which are derived from simplicial complexes in the standard way,
but it's more general: it allows the possibility that two
(formally) different faces of a non-degenerate simplex might
coincide, as long as they're not degenerate.
