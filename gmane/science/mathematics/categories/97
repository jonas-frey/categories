You still need a condition with the same objective.  It is given
by LOCATEDNESS:
    for any  d<u, either d is in the lower cut, or u is in the upper cut
This means that, if you so far know that the number is between d0 and
u0,
ie that d0 is in the lower cut and u0 in the upper one, and want another
three decimal (ten binary) places, you need to bisect [d0,u0] 11 times.

No -- you're trying to force Dedekind cuts (and real computation in
general) into the straitjacket of Cauchy sequences.   This is part
of the longstanding prejudice in favour of numbers and against logic.

If you GENUINELY take Dedekind cuts on board, you can start thinking
of computation using GEOMETRY and other disciplines.

The fragment of the ASD calculus for R has a syntax with
  - types  N, R, Sigma and Sigma^R
  - arithmetic operations   +  -  *
  - arithmetic relations    <  >  !=
  - the usual stuff on N too
  - logical operations   T   F  /\  \/
  - existential quantifiers  over  N, R, open intervals, closed intervals
    (with real endpoints),  ie with types  Sigma^N-->Sigma  etc
  - universal quantifiers over closed bounded intervals
  - definition by description for N
  - Dedekind cuts for R
  - primitive recursion over N at all types.

The primitive calculation is therefore a LOGICAL question,
  - existentially or universally quantified over some ranges
    of the variables
  - of an arithmetic comparison ( > OR < )
  - of two polynomials.

This suggests using SEMI-ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY,  although I do not know
enough about this subject to see how to use it.

A quick way that answers a universally quantified question
surprisingly often is just to evaluate the polynomials using
interval (Moore) arithmetic.

Another technique is to split the range of one of the variables.

A much more powerful technique uses the INTERVAL Newton algorithm.
The "classical" Newton algorithm DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF BITS OF
PRECISION at each iteration -- once you have got below the "typical
length" of the problem.  Above this, it behaves chaotically.
The interval Newton algorithm "knows" how to behave -- like
interval halving when the problem is essentially combinatorial,
and like the classical algorithm when we're below the typical length.

Whereas UNIVERSALLY quantified questions can often be answered
using "ordinary" (Moore) interval arithmetic,  EXISTENTIAL ones
are handled in a similar way, but using "back-to-front" intervals,
whose arithmetic was originally formulaed by Edgar Kaucher.

Andrej's program uses forward and backward intervals to evaluate
Dedekind cuts, but does not at the moment use the interval Newton
algorithm,

Vaughan Pratt said, again in response to Andrej,

In previous ages, mathematicians of the day "standardised" on unit
fractions or Roman numerals.   At one conference that I attended,
a whole afternoon was given over to a team of interval analysts who
wanted to "standardise" their subject, in the bureaucratic sense of
getting some document accepted by the ISO.   One of the speakers did
some dreadful mathematics that depended heavily on decidable choices,
another presented some "software engineering" that was -- even for
that subject -- dogmatic and outdated, whilst the third gave a (good)
political speech.

If you read what most interval analysts write, it is ad hoc and
wrong-headed.   There is, in particular, a fundamental error in
regarding the interval [d,u] as the closed set of numbers BETWEEN
d and u.   Amongst other things, this makes it impossible to understand
Kaucher arithmetic (back-to-front intervals).   Another widespread
belief is that interval arithmetic is some wonderful new algebraic
system in the tradition of the complex numbers and quaternions.

A much simpler way of understanding the interval [d,u],  which is
both constructive and compatible with Kaucher arithmetic, is as
a DEDEKIND PSEUDO-CUT.  The two halves consist of the numbers that
are SO FAR KNOWN to be respectively less and greater than the number
being calculated.   This representation is much more natural, in
that advancing calculation and the Scott topology are in the same
sense as increasing the sets D and U, whereas the closed set [d,u]
becomes smaller.   Essentially, the two parts D and U then lead
their own separate lives, each belonging to an "extended line"
with the Scott topology.  It's actually very simple.

PS.   I have flagged Toby Bartels' question,
> to what extent does ASD have inductive and coinductive objects,
to answer after the current thread about the reals, Cantor space,
the Conway numbers, constructivity and toposes has died down.


PPS.   My website has now gone live on a new server at www.PaulTaylor.EU
whilst the old one is still at www.monad.me.uk.   Please tell me
about missing links and server errors.   The "monad" address will
become a redirection in a couple of weeks' time, and will be
discontinued next year.
