I had known Steve Schanuel for so long, met him in so many
and such varied circumstances, and held so admiring an appreciation
as much for his mathematical perceptiveness as for his endearing
humanity, musicality, and general good cheer, that my reaction,
last week, to Bill's reluctant report of Steve's death left me
simply speechless.

How could it be that Steve was not simply automatically going to
outlive me, by decades?

Today I found the latest AMS Notices in my mailbox, with its Memorial
Tribute to Friedrich Hirzebruch, who passed away, aged 84, in 2012.
This is the same Hirzebruch whose famous little Springer hardback on =

Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry was at least as much my
constant companion, as a grad student at Columbia in the half-decade
centered around 1960, as the equally famous Princeton hardbacks on =

Homological Algebra and Algebraic Topology that Sammy Eilenberg had
his signature on. =


Of Hirzebruch, too, it seemed, I had expected a life unstopped by death.

Finally, after I saw the 1956 snapshot (taken in Mexico at the
conference at which yet another topological immortal lost his life)
of Chern, Eilenberg, and Hirzebruch, now all passed on, it all came =

together for me -- it all "clicked": =


That death we see is not so much the loss of a beloved friend, =

an admired colleague, a revered teacher, an astute researcher,
though it certainly is that, too -- yet it isn't so much a wordly loss =

as it is that History has rung up a new gain: no longer does Steve =

belong so exclusively to his peers, colleagues, friends, and family, =

as to History.

All the many who have left us behind on this world -- George Rinehart,
Jon Beck, Eva Gray, Sammy, Saunders, Steve, Jim Lambek, Hirzebruch,
and all the many others we would think of here -- they have entered =

into the arms of History, and we may but hope History will treat them =

as kindly as we would, were it all up to us.

Peace, Steve; and peace be with all who love you.

-- Fred Linton
