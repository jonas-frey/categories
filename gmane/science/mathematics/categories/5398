Dear Bob,

The subjects in my list were not chosen according to=20
the size of research grants or the number of peoples hired in=20
recent years by such and such institutions.
I know  first hand every subject in the list, at least at the basic =
level.
They make an essential use of category theory,
and they inspire new developements in the field.
I confess that I am quite ignorant about quantum computing.

I do not question the importance of the subject.
But presently, I am not convinced that quantum computing can
contribute significantly to category theory.

Best,
