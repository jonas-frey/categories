SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS
  Workshop on Symmetric calculi and Ludics for the semantic=20
interpretation (http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~quatrini/ESSLLI2008.html)
August 4-8, 2008

organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language and
Information ESSLLI 2008 (http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/), 4-15
August, 2008 in Hamburg, Germany



Workshop Organizers:

Alain Lecomte (SFL - Paris 8),  Alain.Lecomte@upmf-grenoble.fr
Myriam Quatrini (IML Marseille), quatrini@iml.univ-mrs.fr

Workshop Purpose and topics:

  In recent years there have been some important new developments of=20
methods of dealing with semantic and pragmatic phenomena in=20
Linguistics, inspired by developments in Logic and Theoretical Computer=20=

Science. Among these developments, Continuation Theory, Symmetric=20
calculi and Ludics play an important role. Continuation theory dates=20
back from the early seventies (cf. Reynolds, 93) and was at the heart=20
of Programming Languages like Scheme. More recently, a logical account=20=

was given to it, by extending the Curry-Howard homomorphism (Griffin,=20
1990),. This led to several calculi like such as Parigot's=20
lambda-mu-calculus, Curien-Herbelin's lambda-mu-mu-tilde-calculus,=20
Wadler's dual calculus and so on. These calculi are based on the core=20
idea that programs and contexts are dual entities and this is reflected=20=

in the symmetry of the "classical" sequents. These systems were=20
prefigured by the so called Lambek-Grishin calculus (Grishin, 83), a=20
calculus extending the Lambek calculus by taking classical sequents=20
into account. Following Curien-Herbelin (Bernardi and Moortgat, 2007)=20
focuses on the connection between Lambek-Grishin calculus with=20
lambda-mu-tilde-calculus and hence with continuation semantics.
  Classical linear logic (Girard, 87, 95) gives another viewpoint, where=20=

the co-product is realized by an authentic parallelisation connective.=20=

Linguistic applications have been given since around 2000, particularly=20=

by C. Barker (Barker, 2002), K. Chung-chieh Shan (Chung-chieh Shan,=20
2002) and P. de Groote (de Groote, 2001) who exploited the advantages=20
of these systems in the task of giving several readings of an ambiguous=20=

sentence. De Groote (de Groote, 2007) also shows that we gain a new=20
dynamical logic which enables us to elegantly treat phenomena of=20
discourse like anaphora resolution. M. Moortgat and R. Bernardi=20
(Moortgat & Bernardi, 2007) shows how moving to a symmetric categorial=20=

grammar, namely Lambek Grishin calculus, helps accounting for=20
discontinous phenomena that are not captured by the asymmetric Lambek=20
calculus. Independently, linear logic was intensively studied in=20
particular by Girard himself who invented "Ludics" as a new conception=20=

of logic, where the dualism between syntax and semantics is abolished :=20=

the meaning of rules is in the rules themselves. This conception has=20
some similarities with more traditional "Game Semantics" (Lorenz,=20
Lorenzen, Hintikka...) but it is dynamic, in the sense that=20
"strategies" are replaced by interacting processes. Moreover, a new=20
step in abstraction is provided, which consists in stating rule=20
schemata which are only expressed in terms of loci (that we may see as=20=

memory cells).
  The two approaches in this workshop are connected, basically because=20=

of their common root : explorations in the meaning of Logics and in=20
particular reflections on one of the symmetrical systems, namely linear=20=

logic. Linguistic applications of Ludics remain very embryonic, but=20
some authors have already emphasized that it is suitable for giving a=20
framework in which it is possible to study speech acts and dialogue=20
(Livet, 2007, Troncon, 2006). Other authors have pointed out=20
similarities of the Ludics' philosophy with Wittgenstein's views on=20
language games (Pietarinen, 2006). This workshop will provide an=20
opportunity to study these questions. It will accept several kinds of=20
contributions : theoretical works on continuation theory, symmetric=20
calculi and ludics, applied works of these theory concerning linguistic=20=

topics (semantics, pragmatics) and philosophical investigations.


Submission Details:
  Authors are invited to submit an anonymous, extended abstract.=20
Submissions should not exceed 7 pages, including references.=20
Submissions should be in PDF format. Please send your submission=20
electronically using the interface EasyChair. The submissions will be=20
reviewed by the workshop's programme committee.



Workshop format:
  The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants.=20=

It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive=20
days in the first week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 slots for paper=20
presentation and discussion per session. On the first day the workshop=20=

organisers will give an introduction to the topic.

  Philippe de Groote, LORIA, France.
  Additional invited speaker to be confirmed
