Thank you!  This is exactly what I was looking for.

But it doesn't seem to be *well* known any more, or at least
well-disseminated and exposited.  Several people have told me that
they didn't think it was possible to express replacement
category-theoretically without using a category of classes.  And even
now knowing what I'm looking for, I am unable to find more than a
sentence or two about it in any book on topos theory, none of which
actually gives any version of the axiom.

This raises another question.  You mention at the end of this paper
that large-cardinal axioms are "routinely pursued in
isomorphism-invariant terms".  This is clear to me for many types of
large cardinals, but not for the stronger ones that involve elementary
embeddings of the universe of sets.  Ultrapowers have a categorical
analogue, of course (filterquotient) but then there is a transitive
collapse of the entire universe, from which I don't see immediately
how to eliminate the global membership predicate.  Can you give a clue
or a reference?

Thanks again,
Mike
