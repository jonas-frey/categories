Hi Vasili,

This is not an easy one, since that "theory" has changed form every now
and then.

I cannot but see it as related to the unsolved issue of the distinction
between terms and sentences in logic. When we mix the two, or when we
are unclear of the "types" of the two, we will not be able to proceed.

Church in 1940 spoke about the 'iota' and 'o' "types of types", where
'iota' is potentially the type of possible sorts in a "conventional
signatures". Then 'o' is the "type of propositions", but Church was
humble to say that the formal situation about this is not clear. In my
view this has not been properly solved since then. See our "Modern eyes
on lambda-calculus" under GLIOC (www.glioc.com) for a notion of a
three-level signature that may be a solution to some of the problems in
this context.

Martin-L??f started off with a universes V of types, and added an "axiom"
saying "V is also a type", i.e. is part of that V, so "V \in V" was seen
to be ok. It turned out not to, so later it was changed by others to
"Prop \in Type", where Type is like Church's iota and Prop like Church's
o. This still doesn't distinguish between terms and sentences in a
proper way, and type constructors kind of come to rescue "from the
outside" and are indeed not "internalized" within any signature.
Dependent data typing is full of that "externalization".

Howards 1969 note (circulated among a few, eventually published upon
request by 1980) on the subject is also fine, continuing e.g. what Curry
and Fey wrote a decade before, but these notes and writings also do not
conclude anything about Church's dilemma about iota and o. Needless to
say, Heyting's book is "set-theoretic" so it doesn't help at all. I
don't know the "type theory" history and atmosphere from the time of
around 1965 (I was seven years old at that time), but I can imagine that
there was a bit of "fictive mathematics" and ambitions to establish "new
foundations" around tables here and there at that time and during the
next decade or even two. Whether this has been useful or harmful for
computer science as a whole is difficult to say, but obviously, lots of
functional languages have been created upon different views of those
"axioms". Many definitely say it has all been very useful, but I have
started to have "foundational and constructive doubts", at the age of
55. "Imperative" and "algorithm" is still allowed to be "outside
everything", and this privilege is quite "interesting?", but also
doubtful. You may want to recall e.g. what Kleene said in his
Metamathematics about the "metamathematical proposition" R(x,Y): "There
must be a decision procedure or algorithm for the question whether
R(x,Y) holds". Indeed there must be. Otherwise G??del's "theorems" are
doubtful. Maybe G??del's "theorems" are basically paradoxes, showing how
obscure the foundations really are. Freely making propositions related
to truth and provability, and feeling privileged not to keep concepts
clearly apart from each other, i.e. "mixing bags", leads to many things,
but also leads to trouble.

Even concerning the distinction between term and sentence, I strongly
believe we need to be formal firstly about the term monad (see "Fuzzy
terms" under GLIOC), in order to be "constructive" about terms.
Thereafter we quickly realize that terms actually reside in sentences.
Substitution and compositions with it is for terms, not for sentences.
There is a certain "lativity" in all this, and "lativity of choice" if
you want to be foundational about it. I don't think there is a "unique"
or "canonic" foundations.

Basically I am not sure you will find that gentle "tutorial", but if you
do, I would also be interested to read it. However, a potpourri tutorial
or paper is no good, because the light will just keep staying out,
leaving me in the dark, and even worse, in the "foundational gutter".

Cheers,

Patrik
