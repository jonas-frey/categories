Dear colleagues,

I hope someone, and in particular Prof. Peter Johnstone, will help me
with the following information. I thought I had, with Jacques
Roubaud, proved in our joint note at the "Comptes Rendus" which I
mentioned in my previous mail proved a theorem on Monads and Descent.
I must have been mistaken, and also the many persons who quoted this
note, because in El Proposition 1.5.5 is the same theorem, but
attributed to J. Beck.

I immediately "rushed" to the monumental bibliography of El to find
the reference, and there, big surprise, there was no J. Beck at all
among the 1262 references.

Thus i'd greatly appreciate to have the date and paper of the paper
where Beck proved this theorem, and the precise statement he made, in
particular, did he prove his theorem in the general context of
fibered or indexed categories, or only in some very special case.

Many thanks for your help
