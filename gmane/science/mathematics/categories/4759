David Eppstein, a regular contributor to Wikipedia, asked me recently
about background relevant to his recent work on the Birkhoff duality of
finite posets and finite distributive lattices.  This resulted in
several exchanges that can be seen at

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Vaughan_Pratt#Birkhoff.27s_representation_theorem

His last message requested citable references concerning my explanation
of the duality.  The best I could come up with was Peter Johnstone's
*Stone Spaces*, which is where I learned about these particular
dualities.  However my answer to his earlier question was phrased in
what I felt was more elementary language than used by Peter (but of
course "elementary" is in the eye of the beholder).

My question here is, where in the literature is there an account of
Birkhoff/Stone duality in terms of homming into schizophrenic objects at
a level comparable to my detailed reply to David?  The concept itself
can be presented at a very elementary level, but the expositions of it
that I'm aware of presume a degree of sophistication of the reader out
of proportion to what the concepts should require in this case.

If Peter's book is indeed the most elementary account available I'll
settle for that.  Whatever's available.
