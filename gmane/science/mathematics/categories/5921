Dear Bill and Ronnie=2C

=A0

In the context of topos theory it is
very natural to consider groupoids both for Galois toposes as for the van
Kampen theorems.=20

=A0

=A0

See Marta Bunge=2C "Galois groupoids
and Covering Morphisms in Topos Theory"=2C Fields Institute Communications=
=2C
volume 4 (2004) 131-161. I will be happy to send anyone interested a pdf fi=
le
of this paper.=20

I quote from the Introduction:
"Also in section 4 we introduce and study the notion of a Galois topos
over an arbitrary base topos S. Although these relative Galois toposes are =
not
assumed to be either connected or pointed=2C they come naturally equipped w=
ith a
bag of points indexed by the connected components of a (non-connected)
universal cover=3B this is in line with the view advocated by Grothendieck =
and Brown
that=2C rather than a single base point=2C one ought to work with a suitabl=
e
"paquet des points"=2C for instance=2C one that is invariant under the
symmetries in the given situation. This idea was naturally and independentl=
y
incorporated into topos theory both by Kennison and myself=2C by discussing=
  the
fundamental groupoid of an unpointed (and possibly pointless) locally conne=
cted
topos." The justification for these statements are given in detail in the
paper.

Here is the outline:=20

2. Locally constant objects in toposes.=20

3. Stack completions and the fundamental
groupoid of a topos.=20

4. Galois groupoids and Galois toposes.=20

5. Locally paths simply connected
toposes over an arbitrary base.=20

6. Generalized covering morphisms and a
van Kampen theorem.
