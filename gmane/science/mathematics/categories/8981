In early 2014, the n-Category Caf=C3=A9 hosted the Kan Extension =
Seminar, a graduate reading course in category theory modeled after =
Daniel Kan=E2=80=99s eponymous reading course in algebraic topology at =
MIT. My experience with the seminar, described here:

http://www.ams.org/notices/201411/rnoti-p1357.pdf =
<http://www.ams.org/notices/201411/rnoti-p1357.pdf>

was overwhelming positive, so I=E2=80=99m delighted to announce that =
we=E2=80=99re back. Alexander Campbell, Brendan Fong, and I are =
organizing "Kan II" in early 2017 and we=E2=80=99re currently soliciting =
applications for seminar participants.

Our plan is to read the following eight papers between mid January and =
mid May:

* Hyland and Power, The category theoretic understanding of Universal =
Algebra: Lawvere Theories and Monads,

* Freyd, Algebra valued functors in general and tensor products in =
particular

* Beck, Distributive laws

* Kelly, On the operads of J.P. May,=20

* Kelly, Structures defined by finite limits in the enriched context, I

* Kelly, On Clubs and Data-type Constructors

* Lack and Rosicky, Notions of Lawvere Theory

* Berger, Mellies, and Weber, Monads with arities and their associated =
theories

We are seeking eight participants who will read and engage with all of =
the papers as well as prepare an oral presentation on one of them, =
followed by a blog post to be published on the n-Category Caf=C3=A9. The =
course will conclude with a series of short public expository lectures =
given, by those able to attend, on July 16 in conjunction with the 2017 =
International Category Theory Conference at the University of British =
Columbia in Vancouver.=20

More details, including information about how to apply, can be found on =
the seminar website:

http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/kanII =
<http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/kanII>

or by contacting any of the three of us. Applications are due November =
30th. I hope you=E2=80=99ll help us spread the word by passing this =
message along to those who might be interested.

On behalf of the organizers,
