Hi Andrej,=0A=0AThere is an analogous problem when trying to "extend" Gelfa=
nd duality to locally compact Hausdorff spaces and (not necessarily unital)=
  C*-algebras: everything works fine on the object level, but there are many=
  (not necessarily unital) *-homomorphisms C_0(1) --> C_0(2), but only one c=
ontinuous map 2 --> 1.=A0 The standard solution, IIRC, is to restrict the c=
lass of *-homomorphisms to those which "preserve the approximate unit".=A0 =
[As it turns out: every (not necessarily unital) C*-algebra has an "approxi=
mate unit" (even a canonical one); and, for a *-homomorphism between unital=
  C*-algebras, preserving the approximate unit is equivalent to preserving t=
he unit.]=A0 =0A=0AIn any event, I have found it (paradoxically) illuminati=
ng to think of: locally compact Hausdorff spaces and proper maps as a subca=
tegory, via the one-point compactification functor (here denoted ( )+1), of=
  compact Hausdorff spaces; and, (not necessarily unital) C*-algebras as a s=
ubcategory, via the free functor (also denoted ( )+1), of unital C*-algebra=
s.=A0 Since C(X+1)=3DC_0(X)+1 holds at the level of objects (where =3D mean=
s isomorphic), it remains to reverse-engineer the correct classes of arrows=
  in order to piggyback the desired statement off the usual duality theorem.=
=A0 Of course, it's also possible to consider the b.o./f.f. factorisations =
of the two ( )+1 functors: that results in some class of partial maps on th=
e topological side, as you suggest.=0A=0AI expect that something similar ha=
ppens in the case of Stone duality and GBAs.=A0 Hope this helps!=0A=0ACheer=
