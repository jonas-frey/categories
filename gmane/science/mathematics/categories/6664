Fred,

The process of resolving misconceptions and comprehending an
intended meaning is part of learning.  So I view this matter
of "other O" as helping me to understand the equaliser.

Yes, Wikipedia has careless editing and that is one of the
motivations for building the Citizendium.  [http://en.citizendium.org/]
It has careless editing also; hopefully not so prevalent as
in the Wikipedia.  Even with the limitations, the Wikipedia
and the Citizendium have helped me.

For publishing with immunity to outside interference, nothing is better than
a personal Web page.

Thanks for the responses,          ... Peter E.
