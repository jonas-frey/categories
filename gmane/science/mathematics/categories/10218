We invite participants to the on-line workshop TEASE-LP on

  Trends, Extensions, Applications and Semantics of Logic Programming

Logic programming is a framework for expressing programs, propositions
and relations as Horn clause theories, and for automatic inference in
these theories. Horn clause theories are famous for their
well-understood declarative semantics, in which models of logic programs
are given inductively or coinductively. At the same time, Horn clauses
give rise to efficient inference procedures, usually involving
resolution. Logic programming found applications in type inference,
verification, and AI. While logic programming was originally conceived
for describing simple propositional facts, it was extended to account
for much more complex theories. This includes first-order theories,
higher-order theories, inductive and coinductive data, and
stochastic/probabilistic theories.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers that work on
extensions of logic programming and inference methods, and to foster an
exchange of methods and applications that have emerged in different
communities.

Keynote talk: Dale Miller. Structural Proof-Theory and Logic Programming
Invited tutorial: Uli Sattler. Description Logics and Ontology Languages
- an introduction and overview

In light of COVID-19, we organise TEASE-LP as a virtual workshop and
online-only event. To achieve broad participation, we use three
different mediums:
Discussion Forum, Pre-recorded lightning talks, Live sessions with
invited and contributed live talks. Further details can be found here:

      https://www.coalg.org/tease-lp/workshop-schedule/.

Registration is free, but we require all participants to sign up at

      https://teaselp.flarum.cloud/
