               *** CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS ***

                            ICLP'07

          23rd International Conference on Logic Programming

                         Porto, Portugal

ICLP'07, the 23rd International Conference on Logic Programming, will
be held in Porto (Portugal), from September 8 to 13, 2007.

Workshops co-located with international conferences are perhaps
the best place for the presentation of preliminary work or
novel ideas, new open problems to a wide and interested audience.
Co-located workshops also provide a venue for
presenting specialized topics and opportunities for intensive
discussions and project collaboration. The topics of the workshops
co-located with ICLP'07 can cover any areas related to logic  
programming,
(e.g., Theory, Implementation, Environments, Language Issues,
Alternative Paradigms, Applications) including cross-disciplinary areas.
However, any workshop proposal will be analyzed.

The format of the workshop will be decided by the workshop organizer(s),
but ample time must be allowed for general discussion.
Workshops can vary in length, but the optimal duration
will be half a day or a full day.

Workshop Proposal:
==================

Those intending to organize a workshop at ICLP'07 are invited
to submit a workshop proposal. Proposals should be in English and
about two pages in length. They should contain:

   * The title of the workshop.
   * A brief technical description of the topics covered by the  
workshop.
   * A discussion of the timeliness and relevance of the workshop.
   * A list of some related workshops held in the last years
   * The (preliminary) required number of half-days allotted to the  
workshop
     and an estimate of the number of expected attendees.
   * The names, affiliation and contact details (email, web page, phone,
     fax) of the workshop organizer(s) together with a
     designated contact person.
   * The previous experiences of the workshop organizing committee in
     workshop/conference organization.

Proposals are expected in ASCII or PDF format. All proposals should be
submitted to the Workshop Chair by email by February 14, 2007.

Reviewing Process:
==================

Each submitted proposal is reviewed by the Workshops Chair and the
Conference Program Chairs. Proposals that appear well-organized and
that fit the goals and scope of ICLP will be selected.  The decision
will be notified by email to the responsible organizer by February  
28, 2007.

The definitive length of the workshop will be planned according to the
number of submissions received by the different workshops. For every
accepted workshop, the ICLP local organizers will prepare a meeting
place and can print the workshop proceedings, whose LaTeX preparation
is however in charge to the workshop organizers. The workshop
registration fees will be handled together with the conference fees.


Workshop Organizers' Tasks:
===========================


   * Producing a "Call for Papers" for the workshop and posting it
     on the net and/or other means. Please provide a web page URL which
     can be linked into the ICLP'07 home page by April 15, 2007.
   * Providing a brief description of the workshop for the conference
     program.
   * Reviewing/accepting submitted papers.
   * Scheduling workshop activities in collaboration with the local
     organizers and the workshop chair.
   * Sending workshop program and workshop proceedings in  pdf
     format to the workshop chair for printing (deadline to be defined)
   * The use of the Computing Research Repository (CoRR) for the
     workshop proceedings is strongly suggested (see http:// 
logicprogramming.org/
     [Guidelines for electronic publishing of proceedings])
