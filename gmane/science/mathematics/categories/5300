Dear Steve,
Thank you for your precious informations (I have never read the =20
article "two-dimensional ...").
But my interest is really in the case of non necessarily 2-monad over =20
Cat and I am convinced that the adjonction j -| i exists, with or =20
without coherences (for the pseudomorphisms).
Best regards,
Albert
