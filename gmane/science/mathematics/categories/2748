      [Apologies for multiple copies of this announcement]

                   CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


                         ICGT 2004

                 2nd International Conference
                   on Graph Transformation

           Roma (Italy), September 28 - October 2, 2004


The second International Conference on Graph Transformation ICGT 2004,
along with several satellite events, will be held in Roma at the end
of September 2004. It follows the first ICGT 2002 (Barcelona, October
2002) and a series of six international workshops on graph
transformation with applications in computer science held from 1978 to
1998 in Europe and the USA. The conference takes place under the
auspices of EATCS, EASST, and IFIP WG 1.3.
The proceedings will appear in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
series by Springer-Verlag.
The conference is co-located with IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages
and Human Centric Computing (VL/HCC), September 26-29, 2004, allowing
its participants to have a closer look at this important, related
field.


Scope.

Graphical structures of various kinds (like graphs, diagrams, visual
sentences and others) are very useful to describe complex structures
and systems in a direct and intuitive way. These structures are often
augmented by formalisms which add to the static description a further
dimension modelling the evolution of systems via any kind of
transformation of such graphical structures. The field of Graph
Transformation is concerned with the theory, applications and
implementation issues of all these formalisms.
The theory is strongly related to areas such as graph theory and graph
algorithms, formal language and parsing theory, theory of concurrency
and distributed systems, formal specification and verification, logic
and semantics. The application areas include all those fields of
Computer Science, Information Processing, Engineering and Natural
Sciences where static and dynamic modeling by graphical structures and
graph transformations, respectively, play an important role.

Ravi Sandhu (Fairfax, VA USA),
