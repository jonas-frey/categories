Dear Paul,

Here is one possible answer to your question.

One has a notion of action of a monoidal category V on an
arbitrary category X, which generalises that of action by a
monoid on a set; thus we have a functor

(-) * (-): X x V --> X

together with natural isomorphisms x * I ~ x and x * (v * w)
~ (x * v) * w satisfying pentagon and triangle axioms.
Formally, one may define an action of V on X to be a strong
monoidal functor V --> [X, X], where the latter is equipped
with its compositional monoidal structure.

If we are given two categories X and Y equipped with an
action by V, then we have a notion of equivariant morphism
between them; namely a functor F: X --> Y together with
natural morphisms

   m_{x, v} : F(x) * v  --> F(x * v)

obeying axioms like those for a monoidal functor. This is
what one might call a lax equivariant morphism; if the m_{x, v}'s
are all invertible we should rather call it strong,
whilst if they point in the opposite direction then what we
have is an oplax morphism.

The situation you have described is a special case of an lax
equivariant morphism. You have a monoidal category M, and a
functor F : M --> S. Now, M has a canonical action on itself
induced by tensoring on the right (the "right regular
representation"); and it has a trivial action on S given by
s * m = s for all s and m.  Your natural transformation beta
can now be written as

beta(p, a) : F(p) * a --> F(p * a),

and your two axioms are precisely the axioms required for
beta to equip F with the structure of a lax equivariant
morphism.

This whole area of monoidal actions is slightly folklorish
but a useful source is:

George Janelidze and Max Kelly, "A note on actions of a
monoidal category", TAC Vol. 9, No. 4

Also worth mentioning is the work of Paddy McCrudden who has
studied actions by a symmetric monoidal V under the name
"V-actegories".

Hope this is of some help,

Richard
