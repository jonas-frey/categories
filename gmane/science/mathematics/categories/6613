It seems that what Ellis is asking for is not so much the interesting richn=
ess per se
of the real numbers but "the proper categorical framework"=2C that is a fra=
gment of  objective logicto explain how we relate partial structures of the=
  "same thing". Not necessarily an "intersection"but more precisely
  an inverse limit of a diagram of forgetful functors=20
may be the right sort of thing. Straining through many related layersvia na=
turality is the standard way to extract the Structure of a given functor me=
asuring given mathematical objects. Can it dually be a way to extract a ima=
ge of the objects themselves?Bill
