Dear Colleagues,
   This is a reminder that the deadline for submission to MFPS 22 is
next Wednesday, February 22. The twenty-second conference on the
Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics will take place in
Genoa, Italy from May 24 through May 27, 2006. The invited speakers are:
   Marcelo Fiore, Cambridge
   Eugenio Moggi, Genova
