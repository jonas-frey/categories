Max Kelly was not only a power house of categorical understanding, but
he also taught us how to combine beauty with rigour and thoroughness in
his mathematical writings (see, for example, Richard Wood's recent
message!) and thereby rendered an enormous service to the reputation of
category theory.

In addition to creating a world centre for categories at Sydney, with his
willingness to spend long periods of time at numerous places in the world
he was (together with Saunders Mac Lane) also the prime ambassador for
category theory for many years in many countries, where he would not only
give plenty of his time but also never fail to fully engage himself in the
local language and culture.

Early in my career I had the great privilege to benfit from Max's visits
in Germany. Like many others, I will always remain very grateful to him
for everything that I learned from him at that time, and for being such a
candid and inspiring leader in our community for over forty years.

Walter Tholen.
