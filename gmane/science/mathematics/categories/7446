                             Category Theory OctoberFest

                           Concordia  University, Montreal
                       Saturday - Sunday, October 27 - 28, 2012

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   We invite you to join us in Montreal next October for a weekend meeting
   in Category Theory, the "not-quite-annual" OctoberFest. As has been the
   tradition with these meetings, we invite talks from all participants. If
   you wish to give a talk, send your request along with a short abstract
   (well before mid-October please) to Robert Seely (email address below).
   The final schedule of talks will be handed out at the meeting, but a
   provisional schedule should be available on the webpage, if possible,
   before the meeting.

   Please let us know if you intend to join us by sending a short email
   (before mid-October if possible) to Robert Seely.

   We will meet in Concordia's Faubourg building on Saturday morning,
   October 27th. The FG building is located at 1616 St. Catherine W.,
   corner of St Mathieu. Lectures will be in room FGB040 in the basement.
   Further details on the webpage.

   Information re parking: Concordia has an indoor parking garage in the LB
   (Library) building, 1436 Mackay, near the site of the talks - the daily
   rate on weekends is about $6.

   There will be a very modest registration fee (probably $CAN 20, to be
   confirmed) to cover refreshments and sundries (details to be specified
   later).

   You will find a list of hotels and tourist rooms close to Concordia
   on the webpage, with links to those that ought to be the most
   suitable. Please note that October is a popular month for visiting
   Montreal, and early booking is recommended.
   If you have any further questions, please contact one of us.
