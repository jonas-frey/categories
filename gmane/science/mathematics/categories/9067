It would take a book-length response to adequately reply to your
question - more about that later.  But in short here's an answer: a
theorem is the conclusion of a valid argument (i.e. a "proof") based
on certain assumptions ("hypotheses" or "axioms").  And Godel's result
is such a theorem.  I won't attempt to define a paradox, but certainly
it seems his theorem might also be regarded (and has been) as a
paradox as well.  But a better answer might be found in the book
"Godel's Theorem: an incomplete guide to its use and abuse", by Torkel
Franz\'en - I hugely recommend it, if you haven't already done so.

PS: Godel's theorem isn't based on the liar paradox - that's Tarski's
theorem - but rather on a closely related paradox about provability -
which isn't really a paradox after all ...

PPS - you don't really think theorems "close development or debate",
now, do you?!  Experience suggests otherwise I think.
