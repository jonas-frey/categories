Well, if boring means non-trivial there are examples, namely opposites
of cartesian closed categories. E.g. Set^op equivalent to CABA
(complete atomic boolean algebras). E.g. for a topological space X the
poset C(X) of closed subsets of X ordered by set inclusion is an example.
There conegation ~A is the closure of the complement of A and A \cap ~A
is the border of A. This received some attention as models of
"dialectical logic". There are also biHeyting algebras meaning that A
and A^op are Heyting algebras. Subobject lattices of objects in
presheaf toposes are examples of this as observed by Lawvere.
But if you mean by coexponential A x (_) having a left adjoint then
in presence of a terminal object 1 this means A is isomorphic to 1 and
indeed they are trivial.
