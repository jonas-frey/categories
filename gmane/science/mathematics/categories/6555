The workshop is an informal meeting to bring together researchers in
Mathematics and Computer Science with a focus on the applications of
category theory in computer science.  It is a three and a half day
meeting, which starts with a day of tutorial style talks followed by
research and contributed talks.  Student participation at FMCS is
particularly encouraged.  There are limited funds to provide support for
students who wish to attend the workshop please see the website for
