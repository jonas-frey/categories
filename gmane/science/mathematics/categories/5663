Dear John,

Let Dist be the category of posets and distributors (also known as
profunctors, modules, ...) between them. Dist is monoidal via the
categorical product of posets. This is not the product in Dist, but I will
still write AxB for the product of A and B.

Then the opposite poset of A (reverse the direction of inequalities) is
dual to A, in the sense of monoidal categories: there are distributors
1--/--> A*xA and AxA*--/-->1 satisfying the triangle equations for an
adjunction.

It follows that any distributor A--/-->B induces a distributor B*--/-->A*,
which one could call the converse (it is the converse as a relation).

All this works for categories rather than posets, but then Dist has to be
regarded as a monoidal bicategory rather than a monoidal category, and the
notion of dual has to be suitably adapted. More generally it holds for
enriched or internal categories, provided that the base for enrichment or
internalization has enough structure.

Regards,

Steve Lack.
