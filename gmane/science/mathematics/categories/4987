Once, long, long ago, I looked up the Yoneda paper =

then cited as source for the Y.L. =

Agreed: not there. =


But, in another Yoneda paper ("On Ext and exact sequences",
perhaps, I'm relying on memory alone, here), it *is* there,
not called Y.L., of course, but describing, as I recall, =

the connection between n.t.(hom(A, -), hom(B, -)) and =

hom(B, A) in the case that the hom-sets are the =

Ext equivalence classes (the only case of interest =

for that paper).

It didn't take much, either, to see the underlying =

Y.L. structure in the main proof there.

Cheers (and more detail, if called for,
once I'm back from Montrreal), =
