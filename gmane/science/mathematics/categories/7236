                              Call for papers
           6th International Workshop on Higher-Order Rewriting

                                 HOR 2012

                        June 2, 2012, Nagoya, Japan
                           Colocated with RTA'12
                  http://www.cs.gunma-u.ac.jp/events/hor/
======================================================================

HOR is a forum to present work concerning all aspects of
higher-order rewriting. The aim is to provide an informal and friendly
setting to discuss recent work and work in progress concerning higher-order
rewriting. The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics for the workshop:

* Applications:
   proof checking, type checking, theorem proving, functional programming,
   declarative programming, program transformation, using some notions of
   higher-order rewriting.

* Foundations:
   pattern matching, unification, strategies, termination, syntactic properties,
   type theory, for higher-order rewriting.

* Frameworks:
   graph rewriting, net rewriting, comparisons of different formats.

* Implementation:
   explicit substitution, rewriting tools, compilation techniques.

* Semantics:
   semantics of higher-order rewriting, higher-order abstract syntax,
   categorical rewriting.

Important dates
---------------
       Paper submission:         ** EXTENDED:  March 26, 2012 **
       Notification:             April 20, 2012
       Final version:            May 10, 2012
       Workshop:                 June 2, 2012

Invited speakers
----------------
* Zhenjiang Hu (National Institute of Informatics, Japan)
   Can Graph Transformation be Bidirectionalized?
   -- Bidirectional Semantics of Structural Recursion on Graphs --
* Another speaker to be annouced

Submissions
-----------
Two categories of papers are solicited:

     - Category A: Extended abstracts of new results, describing work in
       progress, or problems in higher-order rewriting.

     - Category B: Short versions of recently published or submitted
       elsewhere articles on higher-order rewriting. Papers in this category
       are for presentation only, and not considered as candidates for the
       post-workshop proceedings.

Papers in both categories should be between 2 and 5 pages, and should note
the category (either A or B). Papers are formatted according to EPTCS style,
and submitted electronically via the EasyChair submission website. Papers
will be judged on relevance, originality, correctness and usefulness.

Please address your questions to the PC chair: hamana at cs.gunma-u.ac.jp.

Proceedings
-----------
The proceedings of HOR 2012 will be made available on the HOR 2012 web page,
and a printed version will be distributed at the workshop. Post-workshop
proceedings of extended abstracts of selected contributions is planned to be
published as a volume of EPTCS.
