Dear Ronnie, and all,

In the internet there is no *removing* of any information, as you suggest,
at all. The only way to remove anything (ask celebrities PR people) is to
add new information that supersedes the undesired one. I suggest applying as
many band-aids as are necessary as soon as possible. Believe me, I just
spent 3 years working for a search engine...

Best regards,
Valeria
