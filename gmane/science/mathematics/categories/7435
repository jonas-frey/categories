According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the etymology of
"categorical" derives, via Latin, from Greek kategorikos, which seems
to be a Greek adjective derived from kategoria.

This seems to be consistent with other English words deriving from
Greek adjectives ending in -kos, such as logikos (from logos) and
graphikos (from graphein), explaining "geographical", "psychological",
and so on.

I found one online source claiming "Greek adjectives that end in -kos
do not describe the substance out of which something is made. They
describe the force that is animating the thing in question", but I
don't know if it's a reliable source. See also page 28 in this book
(from 1772, copyright probably expired):
