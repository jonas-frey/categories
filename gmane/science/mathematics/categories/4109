SPECIAL ISSUE ON HYBRID LOGIC
  Journal of Logic, Language and Information
  Call for papers
  http://akira.ruc.dk/~torben/HyLo1.TXT
* Scope. Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic allowing direct
  reference to worlds/times/states. It is easy to justify interest
  in hybrid logic on applied grounds, because of the usefulness of
  the additional expressive power. In addition, hybrid-logical
  machinery improves the behaviour of the underlying modal formalism.
  For example, it becomes far simpler to formulate modal tableau,
  resolution, and natural deduction in hybrid logic, and
  completeness and interpolation results can be proved of a
  generality that is not available in orthodox modal logic.
  Topics of interest include not only standard hybrid-logical
  machinery like nominals, satisfaction operators, and the downarrow
  binder, but generally extensions of modal logic that increase
  its expressive power.
* Submission deadlines: March 1, 2008.
* Guest editors: Torben Bra=C3=BCner and Thomas Bolander
* For further information see the URL above.


JOURNAL OF LOGIC, LANGUAGE AND INFORMATION (JOLLI)
  SPECIAL ISSUE ON VISUAL LANGUAGES AND LOGIC
  Guest Editors: Philip Cox, Dalhousie University;
  Andrew Fish and John Howse, University of Brighton.
  CALL FOR PAPERS
* Diagrams of one sort or another have always been used as aids to
  abstract reasoning. Although many are informal mnemonics, reminding
  their authors about structures and relationships they have observed
  or deduced, considerable research effort has been expended on
  formalising graphical notations so that they may play a more central
  role in the application of logic to problems. While early work
  concentrated on diagrammatic representations of logic as a more
  intuitive or revealing paper-based replacement for textually
  represented logic, research in this area now mostly involves notations
  specifically designed for computer implementation either as
  computational models or interface languages. Examples include
  relational and existential graphs (C.S. Peirce), conceptual graphs
  (J.F. Sowa), various flavours of semantic networks such as conceptual
  dependency graphs (R. Schank), graphical deduction systems such as
  clause interconnectivity graphs (S. Sickel), Venn diagrams, Euler
  diagrams, constraint diagrams, and visual logic programming languages.
* Following the success of the 2007 Workshop on Visual Languages and
  Logic (VLL 2007) (http://vivid.cs.dal.ca/VLL), we are soliciting,
  for a Special Issue of JOLLI, papers in which the primary focus is
  research at the intersection of logic and visual languages.
  In particular, we invite VLL 2007 authors to submit updated and
  expanded versions of their papers.
* Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Graphical
  notations for logics (either classical or non-classical, such as
  first or higher order logic, temporal logic, description logic,
  independence friendly logic, spatial logic); Diagrammatic reasoning;
  Theorem proving; Formalisation (syntax, semantics, reasoning rules);
  Expressiveness of visual logics; Visual logic programming languages;
  Visual specification languages;
  Applications; Tool support for visual logics.
* If you intend to submit a paper, please email a title, abstract and
  keywords to VLL@cs.dal.ca by November 30, 2007. This information
  will be used to assign referees in advance of the paper
  deadline. Your paper may be up to 30 pages, must conform to
  the JOLLI style (see following URL), and be emailed as a PDF to
  VLL@cs.dal.ca by January 31, 2008. Note that although PDF is not the
  required format for the final copies of accepted papers, it is the
  most convenient for reviewing.
* Important dates:
  - title, abstract and keywords by November 3
  - paper submission by January 31, 2008.
* If you have any questions about this Special Issue, please email
  VLL@cs.dal.ca.

ABZ 2008 CONFERENCE
   September 16-18, 2008
   BCS London Offices, Covent Garden, London, UK
   Call for Papers
* Abstract State Machines (ASM), B and Z stand for three rigorous
  methods that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely
  used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis
  of hardware and software systems.  This conference is dedicated
  to the cross-fertilization of these three related state-based
  and machine-based formal methods.  The program spans from
  theoretical and methodological foundations to practical
  applications, emphasizing system engineering methods and tools
  that are distinguished by mathematical rigor and have proved to
  be industrially viable.  A main goal of the conference is to
  contribute to the integration of accurate state- and
  machine-based system development methods, clarifying their
  commonalities and differences to better understand how to
  combine related approaches for accomplishing the various tasks
  in modelling, experimental validation, and mathematical
  verification of reliable high-quality hardware/software systems.
* The conference will be articulated into a one-day common program
  of invited lectures and two days of contributed papers.
*  Although organized logistically as an integral event, editorial
  control of the joint conference remains vested in three separate
  programme committees, which will respectively determine its ASM,
  B and Z content, to be presented in parallel conference tracks
  with a schedule to allow the participants to switch between the
  sessions.  The conference simultaneously incorporates the 15th
  International ASM Workshop, the 17th International Conference of
  Z Users and the 8th International Conference on the B Method.
  It will be preceded by a tutorial day and Verified Software
  Repository Network (VSR-net) workshop on Monday, September 15.
* A case study for design and verification of a flash-based file
  system is suggested to the participants.  Leo Freitas and Jim
  Woodcock will organize a series of intermediate workshops where
  those who decide to work on the problem can meet to enhance the
  collaborative aspect of the work. For details see:
  http://www.abz2008.org/
* The papers are planned to be published in a volume of Springer's
  LNCS series.  Contributions are solicited on all aspects of the
  theory and applications of ASMs, B, Z and related approaches in
  software/hardware engineering, including the development of
  tools and industrial applications.
* Two kinds of contributions are invited:
  1. Research papers: full papers (not extended abstracts) of not
     more than 12 pages (in LNCS format), which have to be original,
     unpublished and not submitted  elsewhere.  Papers dealing with
     the case study are particularly welcome.
  2. Short presentations of work in progress, industrial
     experience reports and tool demonstrations.  An extended
     abstract of not more than 3 pages is expected and will be
     reviewed.  The volume of accepted extended abstracts will be
     made available at the time of the conference on the website of
     the conference, a 1-page abstract of each presentation will be
     published in the Proceedings.
