Dear Eduardo,

Your message contains many important observations with which I very much
agree, and a few others that need discussing. I may comment on it some time
soon, publicly or privately. Right now, my purpose for replying to you is a
different and more pressing one.

I noticed that in your "cracks and pots 93" you implicitly refer to a lette=
r
which I had sent to categories in reply to Peter Selinger, and which I had
also sent privately to various people, including you. The letter in questio=
n
never appeared!. It contained an attachment (to MacLane's article) which,
according to Bob Rosebrugh, was difficult to include, hence the delay of it=
s
posting, and ultimately my replacing it by a brief message in response to
Bill Lawvere, in which I included the URL, as suggested by Bob. It seems
imperative now that I post the original message, without the attachment.
Thus, portions of your letter may make more sense. It is below this message=
=2E

By the way, by my own count, there are only 75 messages posted in the
"thread", but 183 more that were written privately to me in connection with
it. Maybe you included some private messages in your count? Either way, thi=
s
means a *lot* of messages.


Best,
Marta

Dear Peter,

You were lucky to have been away on vacation, but perhaps quickly reading
(how else) the mass of postings in the "cracks and pots" has caused you
intellectual indigestion. Your reaction is therefore quite understandable.
For your sake (and that of others in similar situations), I will sum up wha=
t
caused my postings, and be more explicit concerning


>Is there any evidence to support this claim? I.e., actual examples where
>such research was disproportionally supported that was uncritical and
>perhaps unwarranted? There have been several posts seemingly agreeing that
>this is the case, but none have given concrete evidence.

1.
On March 13, I shared with you all a disturbing posting in Motl's blog,
criticizing category theory in its applications to physics, and more
particularly, John Baez. My concern was based on the possibility that any o=
f
this criticism might be justified because I could not failed to notice how
John Baez had become more or less a prominent figure (as speaker/member of
the scientific committee) in recent(ly announced) meetings in CT.
Explicitly, I was thinking of

Firenze, Ramifications of CT, Nov 13-19, 2003,
Sydney, StreetFest, July 11-16, 2005,
Union College, UC Mathematical Conference, December 3-4, 2005,
Chicago, MacLane Memorial Conference (Unni Nambondiri Lectures), April
7,10,11, 2006,
Halifax (near), CT'06, June 25-July 1, 2006.

2.
On  March 14, and in response to some,  I asked more explicitly what caused
organizers of meetings to bring to center stage one aspect of CT over
others, particulaly one which seemed to me not to be in good standing after
Motl's postings. Was it because it is indeed the case that CT is in
disrepute, and if so its reputation needs to be restored, this being the
best way to do it? Was it because it is funding for CT (notoriously lacking
in the USA) that may be more easily secured that way? I wanted to know
myself, but also possibly alert organizers of meetings to reflect on this
issues, since their power and responsibility is indeed enormous in promotin=
g
a certain kind of research over another.


3.
>From the many responses that I got (some public, and many more privately),=
 I
picked on one (March 17) to add some information that I had just come acros=
s
by reading Nature (on our coffee table, along with a dozen or so scientific
journals), in an article which connected Lee Smolin of the Perimeter
Institute with the Templeton Foundation, the latter a promoter of anything
they can in the borderline of science and religion. In the Scientific
American articles by Lee Smolin on Loop Quantum Gravity and the discretenes=
s
of the universe, a paper John Baez is quoted among the few references  give=
n
at the end of the article. This, in turn, led me to research the Templeton
Foundation itself, and with some help from a fellow categorist who seemed t=
o
know a lot about it, I easily located references to Templeton funding to th=
e
Goedel Centenary Symposium in Vienna, and to the A.Connes workshop on NCA a=
t
the Sir Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge. I was, however, relieved not t=
o
find any direct connection between Templeton and Category Theory. Still, I
meant to warn those unaware of this easy source of funding (with strings
attached). In a subsequengt posting (March 27) I gave explicit references t=
o
these claims in response to some queries.

4.
In short, I do not think that I can be blamed for not being explicit enough
in matters that I could be explicit about. I still do not have all the
answers to my questions. As I mentioned on March 27, I was mistaken in
thinking of John Baez as a promoter of string theory when, in fact, he
promotes a competitor thery, LQG. But the general question of categorical
applications to physics remained. Why are they promoted now? As you, Peter,
kindly offer as a possible explanation,


>Can one rule out another possibility, namely that such research is
>supported because it is original, timely, and interesting?

No, of course not -- one cannot rule it out. Here, I am ignorant of physics
so I cannot answer this question (David Yetter has supported the view that
they are original, timely and interesting, and has contrasted "algebraic" t=
o
"foundational" aspects of CT).  But even if the answer were "yes", I would
welcome responses  to the question which still remains unaswered (except
that most of us surely have a formed opinion) -- is CT in such a poor state
that it needs revamping? Sould we not wait a few years until several
original and interesting (maybe not timely) contributions to CT in
connection with other fields of mathematics are appreciated and incorporate=
d
into the mainstream? What do we gain by pushing those under the rag? To
imply, perhaps, that we ourselves do not value them? These, I believe, are
crucial and timely questions, and I do not regret unwilingly having brought
them up

5.
I take this opportunity to thank Bill Lawvere for his first posting "Why ar=
e
we concerned? I", in which the lucid article by Saunders MacLane (Synthese,
1997) is recalled in connection with the discussions that arose in the
"cracks and pots" so-called-thread (why "thread"?). I am sure that most of
you have read it, but just in case you have not, I attach it here it in pdf
form. This is very timely in view of the upcoming MacLane Memorial
Conference in Chicago.


Peter, I hope that I have answered your questions. I can't speak for the
others who have contributed to this "thread". Unlike what has been
suggested, what I originated on March 13 was far from a "complot". It was a
genuine concern of mine and I see now, by many of the responses, that it is
also a concern of others. On the other hand, getting personally attacked
(for the wrong reasons, to boot) is a necessary price that I have to pay an=
d
it does not concern me as much.

Yours,
Marta
