Yes, sorry about that.  A couple of others wrote privately with the same
request.

I have no problem with the notion of mathematical truth per se, which I
imagine to be what all mathematicians seek, along with mathematical
tools and a consensus thereon by their colleagues.

What I had in mind by the "haunting" remark is that the implications of
Goedel's incompleteness results don't immediately leap out at one, and
there is a certain optimistic tendency to minimize those implications
and continue to argue the issues as though Goedel's theorems weren't
relevant.

We can't *define* mathematical truth (Tarski may have been the first to
enunciate that implication most clearly), yet we can often recognize it
when we see it.  Learning to do mathematics amounts to learning how to
find and communicate those mathematical truths that are easily
recognized as such by other mathematicians according to community standards.

We imagine that mathematics on Arcturus must be like ours, but
mathematics is an intrinsically cultural subject and I don't see why
Arcturan mathematics should be like ours.  Do Arcturans have logic?  Do
they have algebra?  Do they draw a distinction between the two?  Do they
believe in either?  Add category theory as a third framework and ask the
same questions of it.  Do they know about initial algebras and final
coalgebras, and if so which came first for them?  Do they know about
monads and adjunctions, and if so which came first?

That's surely too brief to be clear.  I'd be happy to engage further in
this sort of speculation on the practice of mathematics as a cultural
issue.  I have less to contribute on the intrinsic nature of mathematics
itself for lack of insight into its scope.
