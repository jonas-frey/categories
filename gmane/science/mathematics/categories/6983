i assume that even this pure predicate calculus defines its predicates =
over a set A as the maps
A --> Prop, where Prop is the set truth values. is that right?

then there is just one predicate P:A-->Prop if A=3D0 (empty). you may =
call this predicate identically true, or identically false if you like.

do we also agree (with Gentzen) that a sequent=20
(exists x). Q(x,y)=3D>R(y)=20
gives a sequent=20
Q(x,y)=3D>R(y)?=20
(tacitly, R gets a dummy variable x in this second sequent.)

if we agree with this, then for the predicate P:0-->Prop the identity =
sequent
(exists) a. P(a) =3D> (exists) x. P(x)
gives the sequent
P(a)=3D> (exists) x. P(x)

this is not so unintuitive if you realize that (exists) x. P(x) in this =
sequent must be a predicate over 0, in order to be compared with the =
truth value of the predicate P(a) over 0. but there is just one =
predicate over 0, so these two predicates must be equal.

maybe it's time that we all recall lawvere's "Adjunctions in =
foundations", that appeared some 35 years ago. in its best times, =
categorical logic offered powerful tools to expand our logical =
intuitions.=20
