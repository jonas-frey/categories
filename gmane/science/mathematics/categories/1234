Dear Colleagues,

Please find below an advertisement for a UK Chair in Computer Science.
Three lectureships will follow immediately after the appoinment is
made, allowing for a new group to be formed.  I am sending this
message to categories and types, whose members may be interested in
applying: the Department is joint with Mathematics, and the areas of
category theory, type theory, logic and theorem proving are all
represented at Leicester.

Thanks for your help,

Roy Crole.
