Hi, everyone.

Dee Roytenberg=92s email pushed me to write an email I have been wanting =
to write
for a bit.

One thing I have been trying to do recently is figure out what the major =
(and minor)
open problems are with respect to applications of category theory to CS. =
  I am very
new to this area, and getting an idea of what folks are working on, and =
what problems
people feel are important will help young researchers learns where to =
concentrate=20
their efforts.

I am thinking perhaps we could compile a list of research topics/open =
problems in
this area.  I hope some of the experts who read this mailing list would =
like to add=20
their thoughts.

To start us off here are a few that I know of:

1. Homotopy type theory
     - The study of a new interpretation of intensional type theory based =
in homotopy=20
        theory. This line of research has a lot of interesting problems =
that need to be
        solved, and as applications in the design and analysis of =
functional programming=20
        languages, and software verification.=20

2. Databases
     - David Spivak has done a lot of great work applying category theory =
to the design
       and analysis of databases.  I am not sure what the current major =
open problems are.

3. Security
     - Dusko Pavlovic currently has a number of projects related to =
security that use category
       theory either explicitly or are inspired by categorical concepts.  =
I have read a few of
       his papers in this line of work, but I am not sure of the current =
open problems.  A list
       of the papers in this line were posted here awhile ago and can be =
found here:=20
          =
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.mathematics.categories/8068/match=3D=


What other topics or specific open problems do others know about? =20

I look forward to hearing about more.

Very best regards,
Harley Eades
