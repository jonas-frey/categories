Dear All,

I thought the following workshop on mathematical modelling of
consciousness might be of some interest to you and your students.
Would you be kind enough to share it with your students.

I wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving!

Thanking you in advance,
posina

Dear Venkata,

I hope this email finds you well!

I would like to let you know about an upcoming workshop which I am
co-organizing and which might be of interest to you or colleagues of
yours:

http://modelling-consciousness.org/

The workshop is dedicated to formal approaches to the mind-matter
relation and takes place in a mountain cabin in the Austrian alps in
Dorfgastein between March 23 - March 30, 2019. Unlike usual workshops
and conferences, the focus is not so much to present recent results,
but to create an atmosphere that stimulates discussions of existing
approaches in the field, exchange on open questions and brainstorming
on new ideas and research directions concerning models of
consciousness.

It would be great to have you or some of your coworkers there! -
Further details, e.g. concerning the application procedure, are given
at the website.

Best wishes!
Johannes

PS: It would be great if you could forward this call for application
to mailing lists at your institute, in case this is possible.
