                       Category Theory OctoberFest

                       McGill University, Montreal
                 Saturday - Sunday, October 16 - 17, 1999

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the second notice for the Category Theory weekend meeting in
Montreal October 16 - 17 (next weekend).  At this time, we would like
some firm estimate of numbers, so we can plan the Saturday evening party
- if you have not already sent me a message to indicate your
participation, please let me know, preferably before Tuesday October
12th, if you are planning to attend. (Email rags@math.mcgill.ca)

We have a provisional list of talks, (appended below) and a provisional
schedule will appear soon on the Octoberfest99 web page:

       www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/octoberfest99.html

Hotel and weather information, as well as a local map, may also be found
on that web page.

There will be a registration charge of $CAN 40 ($CAN 20 for students)
($US 30, 15 respectively).  Canadian cash will be most convenient!
Registration will take place during the pauses before and between
lectures, Saturday morning. All mathematical activities will take place
in the Bronfman Building, 1001 Sherbrooke West.  We start with coffee
and registration at 8:30 am Saturday, with the first talk at 9:00 am.

For further information, try the web page above, or email me
(rags@math.mcgill.ca).

See you Saturday, Oct 16th.
