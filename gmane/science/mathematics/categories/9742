hi Bob,
As you'd expect there is a lot of literature into discourse analysis. I'm
sure you're already know about DRT
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_representation_theory
but you may not have heard of  "segmented discourse representation theory
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmented_discourse_representation_theory>"
(SDRT) presented in
Asher, Nicholas
<https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3DNicholas_Asher&action=3Dedit&=
redlink=3D1>
and Alex Lascarides (2003). *Logics of Conversation
<https://books.google.com/books?id=3DVD-8yisFhBwC>*. Studies in Natural
Language Processing. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-65058-5
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-521-65058-5>
or RST Mann, William C. and Sandra A .Thompson (1988). "Rhetorical
Structure Theory
<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~nenkova/Courses/cis700-2/rst.pdf>: A theory of
text organization". *Text <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_(journal)>*
*8*: 243=E2=80=93281.
or  LDM (Linguistic Discourse Model) e.g.  in
https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Eantho/W/W04/W04-0211.pdf, from Livia
Polanyi, for example.
I thought the Tutorial Discourse Structure: Theory, Practice and Use
<http://aclweb.org/anthology/P10-5003>(
https://aclanthology.info/papers/P10-5003/p10-5003) would be useful, but I
couldn't find its contents online.
I don't know much about the area, but I know there are lots more.
best,
Valeria
