 From a computer science point of view, both the first "nice" solution
(finite binary trees) and the second "nice?" solution (possibly
non-finite
binary trees) are canonical, in the sense that the first is the carrier
of the
initial algebra for the endofunctor 1+X^2 on Set,  while the second is
the
carrier of its final coalgebra.

All the best,
Pawel.
