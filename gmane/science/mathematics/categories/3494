I was going through some of my old notes today and came across
investigations I had done several years ago on implicit operations in
Universal Algebra.  These are definable partial operations on algebras
that are preserved by all homomorphisms.  Here are two examples:

(1) Pseudocomplements in distributive lattices.  Given a <= b <= c in a
distributive lattice, there is at most one b' such that

     b /\ b' = a   and   b \/ b' = c.

Because lattice homomorphisms preserve these inequalities and equations,
the uniqueness of pseudocomplements implies that, when they exist, they
are also preserved by homomorphisms.

(2) Multiplicative inverses in monoids.  Similarly, given an element m
in a monoid (M, *, 1), there is at most one element m' such that

     m * m' = 1    and    m' * m = 1.

It follows that inverses, when they exist, are also preserved by monoid
homomorphisms.

Now, the investigation of these partial operations gets one quickly into
non-surjective epimorphisms, dominions in the sense of Isbell, algebraic
elements in the sense of Bacsich, implicit partial operations in the
sense of Hebert, and other topics.  Some of the references that I know
about are listed below.

My question is this:  Does a definitive treatment of this phenomenon in
"algebraic" categories exist?  Are there still some mysteries/open problems?
