Apologies to anyone seeing this more than once.
The Case Western Reserve University Department of Mathematics, Applied
Mathematics and Statistics will soon be advertising at least one and
hopefully up to three Visiting Assistant Professorship(s). These positions
will be for one year initially, with the possibility for renewal subject to
departmental needs and budgetary approval. I strongly encourage anyone
working in category theory, algebraic topology, or related subjects to
apply. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
Nick
