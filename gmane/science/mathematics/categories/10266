                             Call for Participation
                         The 15th International Workshop on
                   Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science (CMCS'20)
                              ONLINE, Sept-Oct 2020
                             https://coalg.org/cmcs20


Update: CMCS 2020 will be held virtually, as a series of approximately
three hour sessions spread across five weeks, according to the
following tentative schedule:

=E2=80=93 21/09/2020, 15:00 =E2=80=93 18:00 CEST
=E2=80=93 28/09/2020, 10:00 =E2=80=93 13:00 CEST
=E2=80=93 05/10/2020, 15:00 =E2=80=93 18:00 CEST
=E2=80=93 12/10/2020, 10:00 =E2=80=93 13:00 CEST
=E2=80=93 19/10/2020, 10:00 =E2=80=93 13:00 CEST

The exact schedule will be determined and announced in August.
Registration will be free (details will follow), but please subscribe

Objectives and scope
--------------------
Established in 1998, the CMCS workshops aim to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras, their
logics, and their applications. As the workshop series strives to
maintain breadth in its scope, areas of interest include neighbouring
fields as well.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
     approaches);
- coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
     languages, dynamical systems, term rewriting, etc.);
- coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent,
     and constraint) programming;
- coalgebraic data types, type systems and behavioural typing;
- coinductive definition and proof principles for coalgebras (including
     "up-to" techniques);
- coalgebras and algebras;
- coalgebras and (modal) logic;
- coalgebraic specification and verification;
- coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and
     hybrid systems);
- coalgebra in quantum computing;
- coalgebra and game theory;
- tools exploiting coalgebraic techniques.
