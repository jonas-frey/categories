Here is a technical/pedagogical question which has been bothering me for
about twelve years.

In problem 5 on page 19 of "Categories for the Working Mathematician" (CWM),
Saunders Mac Lane points out that a natural transformation may be fully
extended to an intertwining function from one category to another, intertwining
meaning (except in the void case), that the function transforms on one side
according to its domain functor and on the other according to its codomain functor.
Then on page 42 Mac Lane introduces what he calls "horizontal" composition
diagramatically and without reference to the fully extended intertwining
functions. But the function composite of such a pair of functions trivially
intertwines the function composite of the domain functors with that of the codomain
functors, and this function composition operation is very quickly verified to be
"horizontal" composition when written in terms of restrictions to sets of
objects. Thus Mac Lane and everyone else I have read leaves the impression that an
honest verification of, say, the associativity of "horizontal" composition
would require a somewhat involved diagrammatic demonstration which, in fact,
would be nothing other than the hard way to prove the associativity of function
composition. Presumably this has been noticed for a long, long time, but the
1998 edition of CWM did not mention it, and I can't help but be struck by the
fact that other authors' terminologies leave the impression that they don't know
or don't care that "horizontal", star or Godement composition is function
composition. Notationally, I am bemused to see the standard symbol for function
composition (the small circle) degraded into a generic symbol for the
composition of just about any category, while a star or an asterisk is frequently used
to denote what amounts to function composition done awkwardly.

This worries me that I am somehow overlooking something fairly blatant. Can
someone tell me what it is?
