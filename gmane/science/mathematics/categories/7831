If you want *-autonomous categories which are not preorders (I assume
that's what you mean by "non-trivial"), there is an enormous selection
to chose from, including the "first" you mention.  One that's simple
to use is "the" free *-aut cat (over an arbitrary category, so there
are many such free *-aut cats), what we call "circuits" (aka proof
nets). One ref:

   Natural Deduction and Coherence for Weakly Distributive Categories
   (Blute-Cockett-Seely-Trimble) (JPAA 113(1996)3, pp 229-296)

In fact, you can find many examples where the double negation
isomorphism is in fact an equality, by the following result:

   Coherence of the Double Involution on *-Autonomous Categories
   (Cockett-Hasegawa-Seely) (TAC 17(2006) pp 17-29)

(Of course the second paper is online; the first is also available on
my webpage.)

This illustrates Girard's point (made in his first paper on linear
logic) that the double negation isn't inherently non-constructive,
rather that the "problem" with classical logic lies with the contraction
structure rule.
