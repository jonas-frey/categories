Yes, Steve! And they coined also the idea of so-called "based objects"
that allow to distinguish between parameter specifications and
imported specifications once you are going to develop a fully fledged
theory of parametrized specifications. Ingo Classen worked out this in
more detail in his PhD thesis around 1995 (?) at Technical University
Berlin.
