Peter Sellinger writes recently:=20

---------------------------------------------------

I think this is a very apt illustration of what happens if a term with
an existing meaning is redefined to mean something else. Henceforth it
is impossible for anybody to use the term (with either meaning)
without first giving a definition.

---------------------------------------------------

I completely agree. My own problem is with term `infinity groupoid' which=
  is used to describe something which is not even a groupoid, and whose us=
e seems to me to militate against the understanding of what has been achi=
eved with the original and much earlier definition. I once asked Gian-Car=
l Rota about such change of terminology, in connection with a refereeing =
job, and he agreed that mathematicians are used to creating confusion in =
this way.=20

There are two easy tendencies: one is to use an old name in a quite diffe=
rent way, and the other is to use a new name for an old idea, so that the=
  use of the old term looks old fashioned, and a lot of work may be consig=
ned to the dustbin of history, becoming not easy of access  for new stude=
nts.=20

It seems to be an example of these confusions is the way the simplicial s=
ingular complex of a space is called an infinity-groupoid, even the `fund=
amental infinity groupoid', when what seems to be referred to is that it =
is a Kan complex, i.e. satisfies the Kan extension condition, studied sin=
ce 1955. The new term sounds like `dressing up' an old idea to look new. =
My personal objection to this change of terminology (i.e. axe to grind!) =
is that this distracts from studying the not so simple proofs that strict=
  higher homotopical structures exist, which mainly are for structured spa=
ces (in particular filtered spaces (Brown/Higgins, Ashley), n-cubes of sp=
aces (Loday), and more recently smooth spaces (Faria Martins/Picken)). Th=
e analysis and comparison of these uses should be made. It was certainly =
a relief to Philip and I that we could do something with filtered spaces =
which we could not do for the absolute case; the significance of the fact=
  that these constructions work and lead to specific calculations should b=
e thought about.=20

The term `higher dimensional group theory' which was published in a paper=
  with that title in 1982 was intended to suggest developing higher groupo=
id theory and its relations to homotopy theory in the spirit of group the=
ory, which meant specific constructions relevant to geometry and calculat=
ions, even computer calculations,  of many examples, in which actual numb=
ers arise as a test of and examples of the general theory, and in which s=
ome aspects of group theory are sensibly seen as better represented in th=
e higher dimensional theory; and example of this is the nonabelian tensor=
  product of groups, where group theorists have found lots of pickings.=20

I am not sure how these terminological problems will be resolved, and I k=
now the term (\infty,n)-groupoid has been well used recently but the prob=
lem of relation to the older ideas, which have had a certain success, sho=
uld be recognised.=20
