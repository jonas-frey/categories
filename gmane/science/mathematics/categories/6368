Thanks to all who've responded.

Peter Johnstone has suggested that such an object (whose poset of
subobjects reduces to just the object itself) is simply "minimal".

And I'm embarrassed at having lost so much of my former grasp of Galois
theory:

No! There is no "non-identity automorphism of R over Q."  Fortunately,
as Mike Barr and George Janelidze have pointed out, each permutation of a=
  =

transcendence basis of R over Q extends to an injection, over Q, of R =

into its algebraic closure C, which is good enough.

Cheers, and thanks again, -- Fred
