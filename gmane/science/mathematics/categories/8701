Dear Steve,

Thanks for taking the interest in the paper.=20

Whether or not the colimit exists depends on which category you are in. =
In my paper the colimit is taken in the category of small categories =
where it does exist. Like you point out, (and David Roberts pointed out =
in a previous post) you might want to do some of this stuff in other =
categories such as the effective topos etc where this colimit would not =
exist. I do not know if the category of small categories is "omniscient" =
or not, and if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but the result =
stands.

(It is not a typo. Since 2 is indiscreet 0-->1 once the output goes to 1 =
it must stay in 1. This is exactly what Halt(x,y,t) does. Once it halts =
it stays halted. But all the outputs can remain 0.)=20

All the best,
Noson

Dear Noson,

It seems to me it's an oversimplification to say that categories can =
solve the Halting Problem. There's a logical principle involved.

In your proof on p.23, the central step is that if H: =CF=89 -> 2 is a =
functor (where =CF=89 and 2 are the posets of natural numbers and =
{0,1}), then it has a colimit H': 1 -> 2. H(t) describes whether the =
computation has halted by step t. (By the way, you use =CF=89_i, the =
indiscreet natural numbers, for the type of t. That's a typo, isn't it? =
Since 2 is antisymmetric, that would imply H is constant.)

Does the colimit exist? That's not a fact of pure category theory, but a =
logical principle of "omniscience". If you go beyond classical logic =
(and category theory facilitates this) then the colimit might not exist.

For example, it will not work in a topos. To find the colimit you will =
need to embed 2 in =CE=A9, the poset on the subobject classifier. There =
you still have the classical objects 0 and 1 (false and true), but also =
intermediate objects corresponding to truth values of other propositions =
such as "this computation halts". This switch from 2 to =CE=A9 =
corresponds to relaxing decidability to semidecidability - and =
semidecidability of the halting problem is trivial.

If my calculations are correct, you can see this in the topos of sheaves =
over the 1-point compactification of =CF=89. This is the classifying =
topos for functors H, and the generic H has no colimit.

An alternative way to understand this is what you see in denotational =
semantics. Here, when a map to 2 takes the value 0 ("bottom"), that is =
interpreted as meaning that the assignment of result to argument gets =
ensnared in a divergence.

Regards,

Steve.
