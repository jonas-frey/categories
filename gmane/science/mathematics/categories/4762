The 6th International Colloquium  on Theoretical Aspects  of Computing
is taking place from  the 16th till the  20th of August 2009  in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia. ICTAC'09  is     organized by Abdullah   Mohd   Zin,
Universiti Kebangsaan  Malaysia   and  Jeff Sanders,    United  Nation
University, Institute  of   Software Technology,  Macao.  The   PC  is

About ICTAC 2009
----------------

ICTAC 2009 is the 6th  International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects
of  Computing, the latest  in  a series  founded by the  International
Institute for  Software  Technology of  the  United Nations University
(UNU-IIST).  The    main purpose  of  ICTAC   is    to bring  together
practitioners and researchers  from academia,  industry and government
to present research and  to  exchange ideas and  experience addressing
challenges  in  both theoretical  aspects  of   computing and in   the
exploitation   of   theory  through  methods   and  tools   for system
development. The previous four   ICTAC  events were held  in  Guiyang,
China (2004), Hanoi,   Vietnam (2005),  Tunis, Tunisia (2006),   Macau
(2007) and Istanbul (2008).

  * parallel, distributed, and internet-based (grid) computing
  * real-time, embedded and hybrid systems
  * automata theory and formal languages
  * principles and semantics of languages
  * logics and their applications
  * type and category theory in computer science
  * case studies, theories, tools and experiments of verified systems =20
  * service-oriented architectures: models and development methods
  * domain modelling and domain-specific technology: examples,
    frameworks and experience=20


Paper Submissions
-----------------

ICTAC 2009  calls for two types  of contributions: RESEARCH PAPERS and
TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS. Both types  of contributions will appear in
the  LNCS   proceedings    and have    oral     presentations at   the
conference. Papers should be written in English in LNCS format.

RESEARCH PAPERS:

Research   papers  should  contain  original  research, and sufficient
detail to   assess  the merits  and  relevance  of  the  contribution.=20
Submissions  reporting on  industrial  case  studies are welcome,  and
should  describe both  strengths and  weaknesses  in sufficient depth.=20
Research papers should be no more than 15 pages.

TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS:

Tool demonstration    papers present  tools   based on  aforementioned
theories or fall into the above  application areas. Tool demonstration
papers allow researchers to  stress the technical and practical  side,
illustrating how one    can   apply the  theoretic  contributions   in
practice. Tool demonstration papers should be no more than 6 pages.

As  usual, submissions to the conference  must not have been published
or    be  concurrently   considered  for  publication   elsewhere. All
submissions will  be judged on  the basis of originality, contribution
to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the
conference.  Submission constitutes a commitment to attend and present
a paper, if accepted.

Proceedings  of ICTAC 2009 will be  published by Springer  in the LNCS
series.
