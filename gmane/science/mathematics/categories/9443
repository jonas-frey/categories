Dear Neil,

Others in this list are much more prominent to answer to your question,
but let me provide one viewpoint.

Set theoryvis really about the theory of sets. Functions and powersets
are there, and complicated structures can evolve. However, a striking
thing about sets is that they are "untyped", which can be given a number
of meanings.

When we move into category theory, the category of sets and functions is
the simplest one. Sets come with no structure, so functions do not
prserve any such structure.

Now, functors over a category become important, the powerset functor
over that most simple and unstructured category of sets being a prime
example.

We need structure, and many real world applications require quite
elaborate structure. Functors over more elaborate categories become
important, where monoidal closed categories as unnderlying categories
bring in fundamental algebraic structures, even for a generalized
powerset functors.

Let me also speak warmly about the term functor, i.e., the functor that
formally constructs terms over a given signature. Such a term functor
over the category of sets and functions produces nothing but
conventional terms, but a term functor over a monoidal category with
more structure can provide terms and expressions with richer structure
and attributes. Stochastic and many-valued aspects are good examples,
and I often refer to nomenclatures in health care, where additions
structure is needed. Expressions e.g. involving diagnoses, functioning
and drugs do not run over the same category, and doing all of it in set
theory is basically ridiculous.

Not sure if these remarks help you at all, so I sincerely hope that more
prominent category theorists subscribing to this mailing list will
provide more enriched comments.

All the best and good luck with your work!

Patrik
