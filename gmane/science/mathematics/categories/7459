Dear Andrej,

the object that you are interested in has been studied by Jaap van
Oosten in his preprint

"A Notion of Homotopy for the Effective Topos"
www.staff.science.uu.nl/~ooste110/realizability/homtpyEff.pdf

A way to define it abstractly -- not using concepts that are
particular to realizability -- is as a
"gluing of intervals Nabla(2)", more precisely as the colimit of the diagram

Nabla(2) <- 1 -> Nabla(2) <- 1 -> Nabla(2) <- ... <- 1 -> Nabla(2).

I don't know if this counts as a "definition in the internal language"
for you, but certainly
the universal property can be expressed in the internal language, i.e.
there is a judgment
about cocones which holds iff the cocone is a colimit cocone.

Kind regards,

Jonas
