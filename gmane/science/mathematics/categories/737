Watch out: Submission deadlines for COTIC'98, EXPRESS'98, HLCL'98, PAPM'98
are coming up!

Participation to COTIC'98, EXPRESS'98 and HLCL'98  will require no fees; 
PAPM will require a (low) fee; participation to CONFER is by
invitation. 

Venue and local arrangements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nice is ideally located on the French Riviera. September is still very
pleasant, while less crowded than the high season. Nice's
international airport is well-connected to all major european and
non-european cities.

The conference will be held at the auditorium of Nice
Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, which is conveniently located
in the heart of Nice, between the city center and the old town, and 20
minutes walk to the beach. The Museum is next to the Hotel Novotel,
where tutorials, satellite workshops, and registration will be held.


Social programme (to be confirmed)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- cocktail offered by the City of Nice at the Modern Art Museum Cafe.
- excursion at Cap Ferrat on Thursday 10.
  Cap Ferrat is a beautiful promontory between Nice and Monaco. Its
  attractions include: walks with spectacular views of the coast,
  beaches, Villa Kerylos (a copy of a sumptuous antique Greek house), 
  Ephrussi de Rothchild Foundation, the charming villages of
  St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat and  Beaulieu-sur-Mer. 
- banquet on Thursday 10 (evening) at the  Royal Riviera Hotel of
  St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat (one of the coast's most stylish establishments).


Registration and hotel information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both the hotel and the registration information will be available
from June 8th at the CONCUR web page.
