There are examples in Ernie Manes's 1967 thesis.  Perhaps the simplest
(although it piggybacks on the non-existence of free complete boolean
algebras that had been know for only a few years at the time) is that the
tensor product of the complete sup semilattice triple with itself doesn't
exist.  The triple takes a set X to 2^X and can be interpreted also as the
complete inf semilattice triple.  On the other hand, I think Manes showed
that the tensor product of the beta triple with itself exists, but is one
of the two inconsistent triples, the one that fixes the empty set and
takes all non-empty sets to one point.  (The other inconsistent triple
takes all sets to one point.)
