Valeria's suggestions look fine. I'd also like to suggest Ruth
Kempson's theory of dynamic syntax (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_syntax ),
which is a sort of indirect response to Bob's question. One thing that
is relevant here is that people very rarely talk in
complete sentences, and that, in conversation, people continue each
other's partial utterances quite fluidly (this is not trivial,
because it involves changing a lot of pronouns and such from one
speaker to the next). Now a natural way to formalise this
would be to have a context shared between the interlocutors, and to
have context updating rules as well as parsing rules in
the grammar. So this, too, would be a way of addressing the questions
which Bob raised.

(Two remarks on this: firstly, talking about context is how I describe
this stuff, not how Ruth does. Secondly, using context
in this way comes naturally to us theoretical computer scientists, but
not so naturally to linguists of the traditional sort.)
