Dear categorists,=0A=0AIs there a standard name for those presheaves X on a=
  category C such that Xf is a bijection for any f in C?=0AI have sometimes =
called them "biactions" since any such X (considered as, say, a left action=
  of C) is paired with the obvious presheaf X' on C^op (a right action of C)=
: X'f =3D (Xf)^-1. =0AOf course, they correspond, as categories over C, to =
discrete bifibrations.=0AI also know that the separable or decidable preshe=
aves are those for which every Xf is injective.=0A=0AClaudio
