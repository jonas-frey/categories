A category is called " left " if it has a strict initial object and any map
with an initial domain is regular (in the general sense). The opposite of a
left category is called a " right " category. The key fact here is that a left
category is never right unless it is trivial (i.e. any map is an isomorphism).
Since may natural categories are either left or right, this enable us to
introduce the "relative version" of a categorical concept with a dual. The
following short note

A category is called " left " if it has a strict initial object and any
map with an initial domain is regular (in the general sense). The opposite
of a left category is called a " right " category. The key fact here is
that a left category is never right unless it is trivial (i.e. any map

<BR>>I can't see any sense in which the opposite of a
<BR>>category can be regarded as complementary to it.

<P>Peter's book "Stone spaces" (CUP 1982) studies many categories that
<BR>obey the rule that the signature of the opposite of C is the complement
<BR>of the signature of C, with respect to both existence and direction
<BR>of sup's and inf's of cardinalities 0, finite nonzero, and infinite.
<BR>Namely, if sup's of a given arity exist in C then inf's of that arity
<BR>do not exist in C^op, and conversely (at least in the examples).

<P>The extremal pair of opposite categories in this regard are CABA,
<BR>complete atomic Boolean algebras, which has all inf's and sup's, dual
to
<BR>Set having none (but for this purpose we could as well take StoneDLat,
<BR>dual to Poset).&nbsp; "In the middle" is CSLat, complete semilattices,
<BR>having sup's of all cardinalities and no inf's, dual to itself via
a
<BR>duality that interchanges sup's and inf's (not to be confused with
the
<BR>equivalence that performs this interchange).

<P>Top and bottom as zeroary sup and inf can be moved independently from
<BR>CABA to Set to give pointed and bipointed sets dual to CABA's lacking
<BR>one or both constants 0 and 1.

<P>Likewise binary (and hence ternary etc.) sup and/or inf can be moved
from
<BR>CABA to Set.&nbsp; Moving all finitary sup's for example turns Set
into SLat
<BR>(semilattices, specifically of the meet kind) and CABA into StoneSLat,
<BR>aka algebraic lattices.

<P>By viewing Stone topology as the manifestation of infinite sup's and
<BR>inf's, the duality of Stone (Stone spaces) and Bool (Boolean algebras)
<BR>can be understood as the migration of the infinitary sup's and inf's
<BR>of CABA to Set, turning CABA into Bool and Set into Stone.&nbsp; From
this
<BR>viewpoint the ability to present limits in Top follows by duality from
<BR>the optional removal in CABA of infinitary inf's to yield Top^op, while
<BR>Frm (frames) as Loc^op (locales) tightens this up by removing "optional".

<P>Chu(Set,2) provides a uniform setting for this rule.&nbsp; All the above
<BR>categories C have a "common" full concrete embedding in Chu(Set,2)
<BR>in which the points remain unchanged (concreteness) while the states
<BR>or opens are taken to be the morphisms of C to the realization of the
<BR>schizophrenic object 2 as an object of C.&nbsp; In this setting the
above
<BR>tendency (but not the converse part) can be made a theorem about Chu
<BR>spaces over 2 as follows, at least for the finitary operations.

<P>Theorem 0: If a space A has constant 0 then its dual A\perp does not
<BR>have constant 1 (and dually with 0 and 1 interchanged).

<P>Proof.&nbsp; A row of all 0's precludes a column of all 1's (the impossibility
<BR>of having an irresistible force and an immovable object).

<P>Theorem 2: If A has all binary joins then the only binary meets existing
<BR>in A\perp are of comparable elements.

<P>Proof.&nbsp; Suppose x,y are incomparable columns of A (points of A\perp)
<BR>whose meet x&amp;y is a column of A.&nbsp; Then there exist rows a,b
of A such that

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
x&nbsp; y&nbsp; x&amp;y
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;
1&nbsp;&nbsp; 0
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;
0&nbsp;&nbsp; 0

<P>is part of A's matrix.&nbsp; Now form the join of a and b:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a|b&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;
0

<P>This contradicts x&amp;y being the meet of x and y.&nbsp; QED

<P>(Apropos of the comparability issue, note that the category of finite
<BR>chains with bottom, with morphisms all monotone bottom-preserving
<BR>functions, is self-dual.)

<P>I don't know how to state the corresponding theorem if any for infinitary
<BR>sup's and inf's.&nbsp; And I have no idea how to generalize all this
to
<BR>Chu(Set,3) and beyond.

<P>I became aware of this complementarity principle for opposite categories
<BR>around 1990, and contemplating it led my student Vineet Gupta and myself
<BR>to (ordinary) Chu spaces in 1992, at which point we learned that they
<BR>were not new (but not well known).
