Seventh Workshop on
MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
Sunday 8th July 2018, Oxford, UK
A satellite workshop of FSCD 2018

http://msfp2018.bentnib.org/

    ** New this time: additional talk proposal category **

    ** Deadline: 5th April (abstract), 12th April (paper) **

The seventh workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional
Programming is devoted to the derivation of functionality from
structure. It is a celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical
Computer Science on programs as we write them today. Modern
programming languages, and in particular functional languages, support
the direct expression of mathematical structures, equipping
programmers with tools of remarkable power and abstraction. Where
would Haskell be without monads? Functional reactive programming
without temporal logic?  Call-by-push-value without adjunctions? The
list goes on. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to
reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.

The first MSFP workshop was held in Kuressaare, Estonia, in July 2006,
affiliated with MPC 2006 and AMAST 2006. The second MSFP workshop was
held in Reykjavik, Iceland as part of ICALP 2008. The third MSFP
workshop was held in Baltimore, USA, as part of ICFP 2010. The fourth
workshop was held in Tallinn, Estonia, as part of ETAPS 2012. The
fifth workshop was held in Grenoble, France, as part of ETAPS
2014. The sixth MSFP Workshop was held in April 2016, in Eindhoven,
Netherlands, just after ETAPS 2016.

Submission:
===========

Submissions are welcomed on, but by no means restricted to, topics
such as:

      structured effectful computation
      structured recursion
      structured corecursion
      structured tree and graph operations
      structured syntax with variable binding
      structured datatype-genericity
      structured search
      structured representations of functions
      structured quantum computation
      structure directed optimizations
      structured types
      structure derived from programs and data

Please contact the programme chairs Robert Atkey and Sam Lindley if
you have any questions about the scope of the workshop.

(New this time) We accept two categories of submission: full papers of
no more than 15 pages that will appear in the proceedings, and
extended abstracts of no more than 2 pages which we will post on the
website, but which do not constitute formal publications and will not
appear in the proceedings. References and appendices are not included
in page limits. Appendices may not be read by reviewers.

Full papers (not two page talk abstracts) must report previously
unpublished work and not be submitted concurrently to another
conference with refereed proceedings. Accepted papers and talks must
be presented at the workshop by at least one of the authors.

The proceedings will be published under the auspices of EPTCS with a
Creative Commons license.

We are using EasyChair to manage submissions. To submit a paper, use
