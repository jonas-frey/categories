Workshop on Higher Dimensional Algebras, Categories, and Types

The importance of higher dimensional structure for mathematics and
computer science has been recognized for a long time. However, recent
connections between homotopy theory and type theory have spurred new
activity that is connecting previously unrelated topics. The workshop wil=
l
be a place for meeting and dissemination of ideas between researchers fro=
m
different areas who all use higher dimensional structures.

Invited speakers:
Thorsten Altenkirch
Steve Awodey
Emily Riehl

To contribute a lecture please submit a 1 page A4 extended abstract
through easychair.

There will be a registration fee of E50 to cover costs which can be paid
in cash at the event.
There will be no separate post-proceedings for HDACT, as there is already
an excellent venue for such papers: the MSCS special issue 'From
Type Theory and Homotopy Theory to Univalent Foundations'

Further information can be found at

The workshop takes place straight after the Fourth Workshop on Formal
Topology, details of which can be found at
