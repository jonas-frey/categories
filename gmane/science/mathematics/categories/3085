I wouldn't call this a "failure" of the set-of-unordered-pairs notion of
undirected graph, which should be understood in 2-enriched (2 = 0->1)
terms rather than Set-enriched.  In my March 1 post I distinguished the
"set-enriched" or presheaf graph categories Set-DGraph and Set-UGraph
from the "2-enriched" graph categories 2-DGraph and 2-UGraph ("homsets"
of edges are either 0 or 1, i.e. empty or singleton), pointing out that
2-UGraph was a full subcategory of 2-DGraph but Set-UGraph was not a
full subcategory of 2-DGraph, via the same mechanism that creates two
kinds of loops in Set-UGraph.

There is only one kind of loop in 2-UGraph, which category theory is
faithful to when this kind of undirected graph is properly described in
categorical language.  One description would be as the full subcategory
of Set-UGraph (= Set^M^op for M the monoid Set(2,2)) induced by the
evident functor Nonempty:Set->2 collapsing nonempty homsets to
singletons; it would be nice if 2-UGraph arose more naturally, e.g. as
some sort of 2-enriched presheaf category, though I don't see how.
