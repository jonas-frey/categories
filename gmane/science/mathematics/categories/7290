Dear Colleagues,

I don't think it is good to say that "Bourbaki had a notion of isomorphis=
m=20
but no general notion of morphism", even in a brief message!

Bourbaki introduces morphisms in subsection 1 of section 2 of Chapter IV =
of=20
"Theory of Sets". Removing Bourbaki's formalism, the definition can be=20
stated as follows:

Let S be a class of mathematical structures of a given type, and let us=20
assume for simplicity that these structures have single underlying sets=20
(Bourbaki also makes this assumption, also just for simplicity). An eleme=
nt=20
of S is therefore a pair (x,s), where x is a set and s a structure on x. =
By=20
a map f : (x,s) --> (y,t) we shall mean an arbitrary map f from x to y. B=
ut,=20
just as in category theory, a map (x,s) --> (y,t) should "remember" (x,s)=
=20
and (y,t). A class M of such maps is said to be a class of morphisms if i=
t=20
satisfies the following conditions:

(i) If f : (x,s) --> (y,t) and g : (y,t) --> (z,u) are in M, then so is g=
f :=20
(x,s) --> (z,u);

(ii) let f : (x,s) --> (y,t) be a map that is a bijection x --> y, and le=
t g=20
: (y,t) --> (x,s) be its inverse, then f is an isomorphism if and only if=
=20
both f and g are in M.

Here Bourbaki uses the notion of isomorphism that he (they) defined befor=
e=20
and that is completely determined by S. That is, according to Bourbaki, a=
s=20
soon as I know the structures I also know their isomorphisms - but I stil=
l=20
might have flexibility in defining morphisms. How flexible it is? Well,=20
condition (i) says that the class of morphisms must be closed under=20
composition, and condition (ii) says that morphisms must nicely agree wit=
h=20
isomorphisms.

The readers not familiar with category theory might ask, why is it so? Wh=
y=20
should we agree that isomorphisms are "more determined" than morphisms?

And one needs very little category theory to answer this: Bourbaki=20
structures are defined as elements of sets that appear in "scales" build=20
using finite cartesian products and power sets (in which we see a "germ" =
of=20
Pare theorem about toposes: no colimits!), and to define morphisms we nee=
d=20
functoriality of scales that we don't have, since we might want to use th=
e=20
contravariant power set functor, as e.g. for topological spaces. And this=
=20
problem disappears of course if we restrict ourselves to bijections. (In=20
fact even without power sets there is a problem that disappears for=20
bijections, but never mind).

The citation from Weil might mean that he misunderstood (or almost=20
understood) exactly this... (I mean, not structures, but parts of scales=20
behave covariantly or contravariantly! - But apologizing to Weil, I must =
say=20
that I have not read the full text - so maybe it is I who misunderstood=20
him... for instance Mac Lanes idea could be that in many cases there is t=
he=20
"best" notion of morphism, which is correct of course).

Talking about Bourbaki and categories, how can we not mention Charles=20
Ehresmann who was far ahead in understanding many aspects of category=20
theory, and actually used the category of sets and bijections to approach=
=20
the general concept of mathematical structure?! (It is interesting that h=
is=20
concept of a mathematical structure is briefly mentioned in "Introduction=
  to=20
the theory of categories and functors", a book written by I. Bucur and A.=
=20
Deleanu). Surely Andree Ehresmann can tell us many interesting things abo=
ut=20
his ideas and the reaction of the rest of Bourbaki on them.

But let me return to Bourbaki in general. Seeing that there is certain=20
flexibility in choosing morphisms is great, but then not seeing that the=20
morphisms do not have to be maps of sets at all is absolutely crucial. So=
,=20
yes, category theory theory was definitely invented by Mac Lane and=20
Eilenberg and not by Bourbaki.

George Janelidze

P.S. Also, as we all know, Einenberg and Mac Lane wrote "General theory o=
f=20
natural equivalences" long before Bourbaki wrote their Chapter IV, which=20
itself was long before 1970.
