The cardinality argument also shows a bit more, I guess.  As you've point=
ed out, the valid formulas in Sh(X) and Sh(Y) will agree if they have the=
 same soberification / locale, or if Y is a product of X with some discre=
te space.  However, even after identifying such spaces, there will still =
be (certainly in classical metatheory, and I think in most weaker theorie=
s) more than continuum-many classes of spaces; so these "trivial reasons"=
 can't be the only cases when Sh(X) and Sh(Y) validate the same formulas.
