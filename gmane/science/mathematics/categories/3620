Symposium goals
----------------

FSEN is an international symposium aiming to bring together researchers, engineers, developers and practitioners from universities and industry working in all the areas of formal methods. This symposium seeks to facilitate the transfer of experience, adaptation of methods, and where possible, collaboration between different groups. The topics may cover any aspect in formal methods, especially those related to advancing the application of formal methods in software industry and promoting their integration with practical engineering techniques. Following the success of the previous FSEN in 2005 a next symposium will be held in April 2007.


Topics of Interest
-------------------

The topics of this symposium include, but are not restricted to, the
following:

* Models of programs and systems
* Software specification, validation and verification
* Software architectures and their description languages
* Object and multi-agent systems
* Coordination and feature interaction
* Integration of formal and informal methods
* Integration of different formal methods
* Component-based development
* Service-oriented development
* Model checking and theorem proving
* Software and hardware verification
* CASE tools and tool integration
* Application to industrial cases
