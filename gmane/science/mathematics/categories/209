WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT:

Categories, Quanta, Concepts (CQC)
June 1-5, 2009, Perimeter Institute, Waterloo, Canada

Organizers:
Andreas Doering, Theoretical Physics Group, Imperial College
Bob Coecke, Computing Laboratory, Oxford University
Lucien Hardy, Perimeter Institute

In recent years, more and more mathematical methods and results from the
field of category theory have been employed in the foundations of physics.
These methods enable us to reconsider conceptual and structural issues in
the foundations of quantum theory and possibly beyond, often providing
surprising insights and new points of view. The workshop "Categories,
Quanta, Concepts" (CQC) will bring together researchers from a variety of
backgrounds, physicists, mathematicians, theoretical computer scientists
and philosophers, all with a common interest in the foundations of
physics. With talks in the morning and workgroups and in-depth sessions in
the afternoon, the workshop will provide ample opportunity for interaction
between the participants from this emerging community. The workshop also
serves as an ideal platform for PhD students to get insight into the field
and to discuss their own work.

Invited speakers:
Samson Abramsky, Wolfson College, Oxford University
Harvey Brown, Faculty of Philosophy, Oxford University
Howard Barnum, Los Alamos National Laboratory
Richard Blute, Dept. Mathematics and Statistics, Ottawa University
Keye Martin, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory
Prakash Panangaden, School of Computer Science, McGill University
Peter Selinger, Mathematics and Statistics, Dalhousie University
Mike Stay, University of California at Riverside
