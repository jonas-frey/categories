The G=C3=B6del Prize 2020 - Call for Nominations
Deadline: February 15, 2020

The G=C3=B6del Prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical
computer science is sponsored jointly by the European Association for
Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and the Association for Computing
Machinery, Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory
(ACM SIGACT). The award is presented annually, with the presentation
taking place alternately at the International Colloquium on Automata,
Languages, and Programming (ICALP) and the ACM Symposium on Theory of
Computing (STOC). The 28th G=C3=B6del Prize will be awarded at the 47th
International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming to be
held during 8-12 July, 2020 in Beijing. The Prize is named in honour
of Kurt G=C3=B6del in recognition of his major contributions to
mathematical logic and of his interest, discovered in a letter he
wrote to John von Neumann shortly before von Neumann=E2=80=99s death, in =
what
has become the famous =E2=80=9CP versus NP=E2=80=9D question. The Prize i=
