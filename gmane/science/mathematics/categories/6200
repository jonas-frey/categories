I completely agree with Andre.

I add:

Furthermore, the introduction of new terminology (specially if this=20
terminology refers directly to a meaning in everyday life) with no real=20
need and/or to change established terminology, is an habit that harm the=20
credibility of any school of research.

In the present case we are discussing a particular single word "x" to=20
replace the compound "not invariant under equivalence". This seems=20
justified by its frequent use, but its frequent use is due precisely=20
because we are discussing its use !!!.
In the practice of category theory or mathematics, its use is not=20
frequent enough to justify the introduction of new (simpler)=20
terminology. What happens with readers which see "x" and do not belong=20
to our group ?.
Well, most will be upset , and specially if "x is evil" (ja !).
