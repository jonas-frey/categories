Dear John,


I am using the following terminology for
higher braided monoidal (higher) categories:

Monoidal< braided < 2-braided <.......<symmetric

A (n+1)-braided n-category is symmetric
according to your stabilisation hypothesis.

Is this a good terminology?

Best,
Andr=E9

I believe that Aguiar and Mahajan were the first to formally introduce =
this
concept, though the Alexander-Whitney-Eilenberg-MacLane example has been
around for a long time.

On the n-Category Cafe, Kathryn Hess recently wrote:

I forget if "Frobenius monoidal" is a precise synonym of "bilax =
monoidal".
