Andre Joyal's message was inspiring.  I think a new Bourbaki type of
effort (this time with motivation and category theory) is called for.  I
would like a text on categorical algebra oriented toward those who have
studied algebra and know enough category theory to use adjunctions, monad=
s
and the like.  The same goes for categorical logic and model theory.

I read Andre's closing remarks as a commentary on the emerging crisis in
overcoming misconceptions about and outright hostility toward science and
mathemtics.  I have a current project, using my own meager funds and time=
,
to advance science teaching using a book available through the National
Academies Press, "Science, Evolution, and Creationism".  From the title, =
I
think you can see my motivation.

In a similar (although less aprocryphal) vein, when I worked with compute=
r
scientists and applied mathematicians in industry ( and also when I've
submitted papers to certain neural network journals) I encountered
misconceptions about and outright hostility toward category theory.  For
example, in the dynamic systems community there seems to be a widespread
myth that "category theory was tried and failed".  I have followed this u=
p
to some extent and haven't found any basis for it.  I am often told that
the best way to counter skepticism is with a working application.

Having tried that, and tried again, I've come to the conclusion that Yes,
you need applications, but applications cannot by themselves counter a
refusal to give a theory credit for being consistent with the data.  You
need a good, clear presentation of the theory couched in a language
oriented toward the intended audience.  As with biology teaching that
shows clearly the importance of the theory of evolution, maybe mathematic=
s
teaching that incorporates category theory needs to begin in 6th Grade (i=
n
schools in the USA) if not sooner.  Maybe a new Bourbaki project could
have an extension into this level of instruction.

Best Regards,
Mike
