As far as I am aware, no generalisation of localic triquotient assignments =
to geometric morphisms has been developed. That's not for want of trying on=
 my part!

A na=EFve approach would be to define a weak triquotient assignment on a ge=
ometric morphism f:F->E to be a filtered colimit preserving functor that is=
 required to interact with the inverse image of f in a manner that mimics t=
he localic case. For this approach to work in a way that is similar to what=
 happens for locales we would need to have a similar way of characterising =
such filtered colimit preserving functors which, as far as I am aware, is n=
ot available (essentially due to the technical difficulty that sheafificati=
on is 'two step' for toposes, but only 'one step' for locales). The technic=
al problems here are, in my mind, the same as the more well known problems =
associated with constructing an upper power topos.=20

My current view on how to solve this problem is to use localic representati=
ons of geometric morphisms. This requires us to re-state the theory of geom=
etric morphisms as adjunctions between categories of locales and to develop=
 'topos theory' relative to these adjunctions. For example 'Grothendick top=
os' becomes 'category of localic diagrams of a localic groupoid' in this pa=
radigm. The lower power topos construction should guide us to see how its a=
ction effects (the category of actions of) localic groupoids; then by upper=
/lower symmetry we know what the 'upper' case should be (and hence to weak =
triquotient assignments on geometric morphisms). Unfortunately getting the =
symmetry to work even at the much simpler level of bounded geometric morphi=
sms is proving a headache.=20

If you would like any further detail, please feel free to get in touch.=20

Regards, Christopher=20

Subject: categories: Triquotient assignments for geometric morphisms

Has anyone generalised the theory of (weak) triquotient assignments
from locale maps to geometric morphisms? In particular, does the
pullback (assuming boundedness) of a geometric morphism with a
triquotient assignment have a unique triquotient assignment satisfying
the Beck-Chevalley condition?

Also, if f:X->Y is a continuous function between topological spaces,
are there any reasonable conditions (other than openness) under which
the interior of the direct image along f is a weak triquotient
assignment for the inverse image map?

Thanks,

Barney.
