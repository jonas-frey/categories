Hi all,

I post this here because I know many people on this list often use
graphs, string diagrams, Penrose diagrams, circuit diagrams, flow
charts, and related objects in their papers, so they may find this
tool useful.


*   *   *

Today is the first official release of TikZiT 2.0, a GUI editor for
graphs, string diagrams, Penrose diagrams, flow charts, etc based on
the popular PGF/TikZ macro library. It's free, open source (GPLv3),
and available for Mac, Linux, and Windows here:

https://tikzit.github.io

For those who don't already use TikZiT, it's a very simple editor for
graph-like diagrams, whose native file format is a subset of PGF/TikZ.
That means files created with TikZiT can be included directly into
your papers. Everything is locked to a grid a by default, so its
output is quite precise and high-quality. It was used, for example, to
produce all of the >2000 figures in this book:
http://cambridge.org/pqp

For those who already use TikZiT 1, the biggest changes you will
notice if you switch to TikZiT 2 are:

1. better documentation and more editing features (e.g. "nudging"
nodes off the grid by small amounts)
2. much better Linux & Windows support (this was in pretty bad shape
in TikZiT 1)
3. a new *.tikzstyles format for saving and sharing sets of node/edge
styles, which can *also* be included directly into your papers.
4. no PDF preview yet in 2.0, but coming soon...

If you use TikZiT, I'd love to hear from you, so send me an email. If
you have bug reports or feature requests, post them here:

https://github.com/tikzit/tikzit/issues


Happy TikZ-ing!


Aleks
