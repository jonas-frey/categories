Call For Papers
==============================================
Seventh ACCAT Workshop
on Applied and Computational
Category Theory (ACCAT 2012)

Tallinn, Estonia
Sun, April 01, 2012

(co-located with ETAPS 2012)

http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~tsoboll/ACCAT
==============================================

HISTORY AND SCOPE:
   The originators of the ACCAT workshops are Hartmut Ehrig (Berlin)
   and Jochen Pfalzgraf (Salzburg) starting with the 1st ACCAT workshop at
ETAPS 2006.
   Category Theory is a well-known powerful mathematical modeling language
with a
   wide area of applications in mathematics and computer science, including
especially
   the semantical foundations of topics in software science and development.
   Categorical methods are already well established for the semantical
foundation of type theory
   (Cartesian closed categories), data type specification frameworks
(institutions) and
   graph transformation (adhesive high level replacement categories).


TOPICS for this workshop include but are not strictly limited to are:
   General Modeling Aspects
   Categorical, Algebraic, Geometric, Topological Modeling Aspects
   Petri Nets, Process Algebras, Activity Networks
   Logical Modeling, Unifying Frameworks
   Coalgebraic Methods in Systems Theory
   Generalized Automata, Categorical Methods


POST PROCEEDINGS:
   The camera-ready papers will appear in the local workshop proceedings,
   which are distributed on memory sticks.
   There will be formal post-proceedings containing all accepted papers
   and papers of the invited talks, published as a volume of EPTCS
   (Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science,
http://www.eptcs.org/).


SUBMISSION:
   Please provide your submission using the EPTCS style, and submit the
papers via the
   easychair link (http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=accat2012).
   Papers should not extend 15 pages.


REGISTRATION:
   Please follow the registration instructions at www.etaps.org.
   Note that the early registration for ETAPS 2012 ends at 29th Jannuary
2012.


IMPORTANT DATES:
   Paper submission deadline: 09th Dec. 2011
   Author Notification of Acceptance: 16th Jan. 2012
   Submission deadline for Camera Ready Version: 1st Feb. 2012
   Workshop: Sun, April 01, 2012


Program Co-Chairs
   Ulrike Golas (Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany)
   Thomas Soboll (University of Salzburg, Austria)
