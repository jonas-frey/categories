I'd like to know the answer to this too. Why does *everyone*, in writing
down the definition of a PCA, include the assumption that Sxy is always
defined? As far as I can see, the only answer is "because everyone else
does so"; the condition is never used in the construction of
realizability toposes, or in establishing any of their properties.
In every case where you need to know that a particular term Sab is
defined, it's easy to find a particular c such that Sabc is provably
defined.
