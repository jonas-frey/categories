One suggestion is to say that an object X in a category C (with products) is
connected relative to a functor F:B-->C if passing from maps  m:b-->b' in B
to maps
XxF(b)-->F(b')  (by composing the projection XxF(b)-->F(b) with F(m) ) is a
bijection for every b,b'
(or possibly just onto, not bijection, could be stipulated, but I don't know
how inappropriate that would be).

If pullbacks exist X*: C-->C/X, then this is equivalent to X*F full and
faithful (or just full).

If say b=1=terminal of B (and F(1)=1), then it is as if to say that if X is
connected (relative to F), then elements of any b'
are in bijection with (or at least onto) maps X --> F(b'): every such map is
thus `constant'.

For example, in this sense we may speak of a connected object X in a topos
E-->S relative to Delta: S--->E.
