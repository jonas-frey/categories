A further attempt to provide a general context for Richard's
observation: let f: C --> D be a functor between small
categories having a right multi-adjoint in the sense of Diers,
i.e. such that, for each object b of D, the comma category
(f \downarrow b) is a disjoint union of categories with
terminal objects. (Note that this is always the case when
C is discrete, as in the example considered by Richard, since
then the (f \downarrow b) are also discrete.) Then the left
Kan extension functor
f_!: [C,Set] --> [D,Set] can be constructed using only
coproducts rather than more general colimits, from which it
follows easily that it is faithful and preserves equalizers.
Hence it is comonadic. (I suspect that this may be a
necessary as well as a sufficient condition for comonadicity
of f_!, but I don't yet have a proof.)

Incidentally, note that if C and D are any two categories with
the same set of objects, we can construct a comonadic
adjunction (in either direction) between [C,Set] and [D,Set],
by `interposing' the discrete category with the same objects, in the
manner of Richard's example. Indeed, we don't even need the
categories to have the same objects: all we need is to find a
set which surjects onto both ob C and ob D.
