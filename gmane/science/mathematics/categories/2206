INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ALGEBRAIC AND TOPOLOGICAL METHODS IN NON-CLASSICAL LOGICS

Tbilisi, Georgia, 7 - 11 July 2003

The aim of this conference is to present some recent advances in the use of
algebraic, order-theoretic, and topological methods in non-classical logics.
We also hope to bring together researchers in the fields of non-classical
logics, lattice theory, universal algebra, category theory, and general
topology in order to foster collaboration and to get new ideas for further
research.

CONFERENCE TOPICS:

Lattices with operators
Topological semantics of modal logic
Topological and topos semantics of intuitionistic logic
Ordered topological spaces.

INVITED SPEAKERS:

Johan van Benthem, University of Amsterdam
Leo Esakia, Georgian Academy of Sciences
Mai Gehrke, New Mexico State University
