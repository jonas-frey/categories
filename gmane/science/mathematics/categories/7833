Yes, this is what I meant.  I guess I should have not said =
"non-trivial", due to
it being somewhat ambiguous.=20

I have not read this.  Grabbing it now.

Wonderful!  I will grab this too.

Indeed, and this point is wonderful, because it tells us that in linear =
logic
every connective can have a dual without the equational reasoning=20
collapsing.  What do I mean by this?  Consider bi-intuitionistic logic.
It is well-known (Crolard:2001) that taking a bi-cartisan closed =
category
and adding co-exponentials we obtain a preorder. =20

What I am working on is showing that we can do a similar construction
using linear categories without degenerating to a preorder in general.
That is taking a linear category and its dual a collinear category and=20=

smashing them together into what I call a dual linear category.=20

Bellin:2012 showed that a collinear category does (unsurprisingly)=20
model a co-linear type theory using Crolard's term assignment to
co-inutitionisitc logic.  However, I am a bit dubious of his chosen =
path.
It is well known that Crolard's subtractive logic is not complete for
bi-intuitionstic logic.  So melding together Bellin's model for=20
co-intutionsitic logic, co-linear categories, with linear categories
may not yield a model for bi-intutitionistic linear logic.  So this
seems to be an open question.

Anyway, just thought I would mention what I am working on if
anyone has any feedback.  Thanks for such a quick response.
