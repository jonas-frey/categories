Hi, the following is related (or the same ?):

In my thesis (SLN 145, page 135) I consider the dual case of
monads=triples in the enriched V-category case.

Considering triple T in A (with the smallness (*) condition of being the
codensity triple determined by a set of objects in A).

I construct a chain of categories

B=A_oo ---> ... ---> A_a ---> .... ---> A_b ---> ... A_1 ---> A_0=A

where A_1 is the category of algebras for the triple T in A

A_(a+1) ---> A_a ,  A_(a+1) is algebras for a triple in A_a

for a limit ordinal a,  A_a is a limit of the preceeding chain of rigth
adjoints.

B is the limit of the large tower over all the ordinals, which is shown
to exists (see (*)).

We have  for all "a"  a rigth adjoint functor  A_a ---> A determining a
triple T_a in A and also a rigth adjoint functor  B ---> A, which is
full and faithful and so the corresponding cotriple in B is the
identity, and the corresponding triple T_oo in A is idempotent. There
are maps of triples:

     T_oo ---> ... ---> T_a ---> ... ---> T_b ---> ... --->  T_1  = T

(with T_oo idempotent).

(*) The smallness condition is not needed to develop this construction,
but it is needed to prove that the process stabilizes, that is, that the
cotriple in B is the identity.
