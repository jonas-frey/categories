CSL is the annual conference of the European Association for Computer
Science Logic (EACSL). The conference is intended for computer scientists
whose research activities involve logic, as well as for logicians working
on issues significant for computer science. Suggested, but not exclusive,
topics of interest include:

* abstract datatypes,
* automated deduction,
* categorical and topological approaches,
* concurrency theory,
* constructive mathematics,
* database theory,
* domain theory,
* finite model theory,
* lambda and combinatory calculi,
* logical aspects of computational complexity,
* logical foundations of programming paradigms,
* linear logic,
* modal and temporal logics,
* model checking,
* program logics and semantics,
* program specification, transformation and verification,
* rewriting,
* symbolic computation.

PAPER SUBMISSIONS
Submitted papers must be written in English and describe work not previously
published. They must not be submitted concurrently to a journal or to another
conference. Papers authored or coauthored by members of the Program
Committee are not allowed. Submissions must not exceed 15 pages, including

authors; physical and e-mail addresses; telephone and (if available) fax
number for each author; identification of corresponding author, if not the
first author; an abstract of no more than 200 words; a list of keywords.

Submissions must arrive by  March 19, 1999, and notifications of acceptance
will be sent by May 31, 1999. Authors are invited to send manuscripts by
electronic mail, as uuencoded gzipped postcript files:

* see the conference home page for instructions
	http://mozart.sip.ucm.es:1580/csl99
* or send an empty message with subject "submission information'' to
	csl99org@eucmos.sim.ucm.es

Those authors without access to the facilities for electronic submission
can alternatively submit five hardcopies to:

	Prof. Mario Rodriguez Artalejo, CSL'99
	Departamento de  Sistemas Informaticos y Programacion
	Facultad de Matematicas, Universidad Complutense de Madrid
	Av. Complutense s/n

PUBLICATION
Papers accepted by the Program Committee must be presented at the
conference and will appear in a proceedings volume, to be published by
Springer Verlag in the "Lecture Notes in Computer Science" series.
The second refereeing round which was requested in previous CSL editions
before accepting a paper for publication in the proceedings, has been
suppressed following the decision taken by the EACSL membership
meeting held during CSL'98 (Brno, Czech Republic, August 25th 1998).

Final versions of accepted papers will be due by July 12, 1999.
The format for camera-ready manuscripts will be that of Springer LNCS;
instructions can be found in the LNCS home page at:
