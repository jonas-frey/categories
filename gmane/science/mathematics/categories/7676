It seems to me that I called it an Ore condition, as suggested by Peter
Johnstone, in my Acyclic Models book and I almost surely got that name
from Gabriel-Zisman.  Since it has been used that way in at least two
books and generalizes a well-known condition from rings (also monoids) I
see no good reason not to go with that.
