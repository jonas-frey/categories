Fields Workshop on Smooth Structures in Logic, Category Theory and =
Physics=20
May 1-3 2008, Ottawa
***

Since the weekend of the Workshop coincides with the annual Tulip =
Festival (which attracts many tourists) it will be difficult and =
expensive to find accommodation in town. We have therefore reserved =
rooms at two nearby hotels (at a discount rate) as well as a few units =
in the University Residence. We can hold these rooms until April 1st, so =
we recommend those who intend to attend the workshop to book as soon as =
possible in order to avoid disappointment. Information about these =
hotels can be found on the local web page:
