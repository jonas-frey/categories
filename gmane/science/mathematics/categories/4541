We have received a bit of money from Concordia Univeristy towards the
Octoberfest and have decided that we would like to help out graduate students
who wish to attend.  So any grad student who is planning to attend and would
like support should write to Robert Seely (rags@math.mcgill.ca) by Sept 15 at
the latest and make a request.  We may or may not be able to help with travel
expenses, but we should be able to pay for local hotel bills, although
everything depends on how many applicants.  Participants will have to
submit original bills to be reimbursed.  Sorry, but it will be impossible
to provide money beforehand.

As usual, people wishing to talk should let us know ASAP.  Since we are trying
to arrange a lunch on Saturday, we would also appreciate knowing who is
planning to come.  Again ASAP.

Michael
