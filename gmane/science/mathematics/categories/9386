Dear Andr??,

with great sorrow I read you description of Myles Tierney's life. Let me
fill a small gap.

I met Myles the first time in Saarbr??cken. He and his familiy were
hosted for some time by the late Hans-Berndt Brinkmann after his return
from a visiting stay in Houston, where they both became acquainted.

I don't?? remember the exact date, but according to your description it
must have happened between Myles' stays in Houston and Z??rich.

We esteemed Myles very much as human being and as mahematician.

Thank you for your orbituary

yours

Rudolf Fritsch
