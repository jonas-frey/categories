Dear category theorists, 

Recently I came across geometric formulae (built up from atomic formulae
using only conjunction, disjunction and existential quantification).  I
would know like to know whether there is any way to decide whether an
arbitrary given first order formula is (classically) equivalent to a
geometric formula (or geometric axiom: phi -> psi where phi and psi are
both geometric formulae).  I've looked in the book by Mac Lane and Moerdijk
but didn't discover a general decision method.  Any hints or references
to relevant literature would be much appreciated.

Best regards,
Karel Stokkermans
