Indeed, are there any at all? If you have coproducts you can define
the infinite collection of objectss 0,1,2,... and if you identify any
of those you get equational  inconsistency. A similar construction
should also work for CCCs. In the simply typed lambda calculus with
one base type o you can iterpret n as o^n -> o and you get equational
inconsistency if you identify any two finite types. This carries over
to a finite collection of base types, and hence there cannot be a
finite CCC which isn't a preorder. I am sure there must be a more
elegant proof of this.

Cheers,
