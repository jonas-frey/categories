I imagine there are many on the categories mailing list who would
want to know this sad news. I've known Harold ever since the first
meeting of the Peripatetic Seminar (May 1976): he was one of the select
few who attended both the first and the 100th meeting.

Dear all,

you have recently visited Harold, or expressed an interest in
visiting him.

I'm afraid I have to tell you that he died this afternoon. I had no
idea that this might happen so soon.

For the moment I don't know what else to say.

Andrea
