Why not get it retyped in TeX (making minor changes - but don't
attempt a serious revision, which would just take time with little
reward towards the project in mind)? - there are bound to be
secretaries who could do that for a reasonable fee.  This would only
be worth it if you can get a "subscription" system to offset that fee
of course.  I do have a copy myself - picked up in a second hand shop
in Cambridge during one of the category meetings there - I think it
was in the late 80's.  That copy has been duplicated several times in
recent years; I think at least one of its offspring has made it back
to Sydney!  So, although I may not buy another copy, I would encourage
any efforts to keep this book in circulation.

Mike Barr may have some advice - both the books he and Charles wrote
are now available cheaply, one on the web, the other via the CRM (at U
de Montreal).
