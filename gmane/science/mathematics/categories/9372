Addressing the nLab article cited by John Baez, if we take "graph" to
mean a heterogeneous algebra with two carriers V and E and two lawless
operations s,t: E --> V, then I don't see any definition in that article
that would make graphs algebraic in sets, contrary to my claim that they
are.?? The article contains "inequivalent definitions" in about the same
sense that Republican senators have inequivalent notions of climate change.

A simple way to fix this (that should satisfy all Republicans) is to
interpret "graph" as meaning "reflexive graph", namely a graph in the
above sense further equipped with an operation i: V --> E satisfying sis
= s and tit = t.?? By Morita (details later), this is equivalent to
having just the one sort E with s,t: E --> E being two idempotents, ss =
s, tt = t, satisfying in addition ts = s, st = t.

With only one sort we clearly have an algebraic category of graphs of
the kind envisaged in the nLab article.?? The underlying set U(G) of the
graph G is simply its set of edges, and the free graph F(X) is a graph
with X independent edges in the sense that the adjacency relation
between their 2X endpoints of those edges is empty.?? Put differently, in
the free graph no edge touches itself or any other edge, entirely dual
to free love.?? Honest Republicans will understand.

But this is not the only solution.?? Completely missing from the article
is any mention of a functor A: T --> Set as an algebra in its own right,
as distinct from a functor U: A --> V as a V-valued forgetful functor
from an algebraic category A?? per section 5, References, of the
article.???? Such a functor A: T --> Set is a heterogeneous "T-algebra" in
the sense that it is a model of the (small) category T understood as a
theory.?? We understand the objects of T as its sorts, and its morphisms
as its (unary) operation symbols.?? The algebra A interprets the sorts ??
of T as sets A(??) and the operation symbols of T as unary operations
acting on those sets.?? The functor category Set^T is the category of all
T-algebras (in this sense) and their homomorphisms, namely their natural
transformations.

This logical development mirrors (literally) the geometric notion of a
presheaf A: J' --> Set on a base J = T' = T^op, with the category Set^T
of T-algebras (in this sense) being identical to the presheaf category
Psh(J).

Had we required T to have finite products it would be a Lawvere theory
whose models are functors preserving those products.?? However products
are not needed when all operations are unary.?? If we define a Lawvere
theory to have *specified* products, and a model thereof to preserve
only the specified ones, then T in this context is vacuously a Lawvere
theory because no products have been specified.

If Bill has a different suggestion I'm all ears.?? If this is already a
standard convention however then hopefully it will find its way onto the
appropriate nLab/Wikipedia/Mathworld/whatever articles. Bearing in mind
that every presheaf category is a topos, respect for products is
disrespectful to toposes so don't insist on the former if your point
whatever it is doesn't need it.

When T consists of two objects v and e and two morphisms s,t: e --> v,
along with the obligatory identity morphisms at v and e required to
round out T to a category, a graph G is simply a functor G: T --> Set
interpreting v and e as sets G(v) and G(e) of respectively vertices and
edges, and s and t as functions G(s), G(t): G(e) --> G(v) yielding
respectively the source and target vertices of each edge in G(e).?? The
functor category Set^T is then the category of graphs thus defined,
representing graphs as functors and the homomorphisms between those
graphs as the natural transformations between those functors.

T-algebras being presheaves on T' (= T^op), the homfunctor T' x T -->
Set transposes as the Yoneda embedding Y: T' --> Set^T (more usually
written as Y: J --> Set^J').?? Y is a fully faithful functor that
interprets T' as a small subcategory of Set^T consisting of primitive
algebras, one per sort.

In the case of graphs, Y interprets T' as two graphs, one consisting of
a lone vertex Y(v), the other of a lone edge Y(e), and interprets s and
t as graph homomorphisms mapping the lone vertex to respectively the
source and target of the lone edge.

Note the contravariance of Y in T, aka the covariance of Y in T'. This
is an elementary example of the duality of word (a small theory T with
operation symbols s and t) and object (a small category T' of
fundamental graphs Y(v) and Y(e) and homomorphisms Y(s) and Y(t) from
Y(v) to Y(e)).

We don't need to go this route in order to make reflexive graphs
algebraic in the sense of the nLab article, as noted earlier.?? But in
the spirit of making mathematics difficult we should attempt that North
Face, in the process explaining Morita equivalence as promised.

Take T to be the three-element monoid (one-object category) {1,s,t}
satisfying xy = y when y is not the identity. ?? This T is an idempotent
monoid in the sense that every element is an idempotent. (But it is not
the *free* idempotent monoid on generators s and t, which would also
contain st, ts, sts, and tst as distinct elements, thanks to the
additional equations st = t, ts = s.)?? The reflexive graphs of our
second paragraph can be seen to be the functors from this T to Set, and
as homogeneous algebras they are algebraic in the sense of the nLab
article John cited.?? More generally, for any monoid M, the category of
M'-sets, or models of M, is algebraic in that sense as well as in the
sense of the functor category Set^M. (The opposite of a monoid M is of
course a monoid M', so M-sets generally understood are the same thing
whether you're thinking of some monoid either as a theory or as a base
for presheaves.)

Now if we split each of the idempotents s and t in T = {1,s,t} to give
their respective retracts (the Karoubi envelope or free Cauchy
completion of T), and then identify the two retracts as v (which
therefore splits both s and t), we have a Cauchy completion T* of T with
two objects and morphisms s,t: E --> V and i: V --> E.

When Set^C and Set^D are equivalent we say that C and D are *Morita
equivalent*.???? It is a theorem that splitting idempotents in a category
C yields a category that is Morita equivalent to C.?? It therefore
follows that Set^T* is equivalent to Set^T.?? This gets us to the
two-sorted theory of reflexive graphs, but by Morita equivalence its
category is still algebraic in the sense of that nLab article, even
though it does not consist of homogeneous algebras.

In general categories A of heterogeneous algebras with two or more sorts
don't have forgetful functors U: A --> Set with left adjoints, but it's
nice to have the occasional counterexample.
