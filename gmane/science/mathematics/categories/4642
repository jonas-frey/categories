The term "Kelley space" is a misnomer
(due to Gabriel & Zisman ?), resulting from
a misinterpretation of the prefix in "k-space".
JLK's excellent 1955 textbook, from which=20
many of us learned mathematics, was not doing
subtle self-promotion when he used that term in=20
his clear exposition. In  fact, "k" stands for
kompakt, and the term was used by
Hurewicz in his 1949 lectures at Princeton where
he introduced these spaces. I have that from
telephone discussions with the late David Gale,
who had mentioned Hurewicz's k-spaces in his=20
1950 PAMS paper (as noticed by Horst Herrlich).
The same implicit idea is used in RH Fox's 1945
paper (except  based on countable=20
compact spaces instead of all), which was directly
incited by a letter from Hurewicz.
