We should not put everything in the same bag !!

"strange," "charm," "beauty" and even "quark" itself

are beautiful  and poetic names  to refer to objects or concepts which
precisely we do not want to associate any precise meaning in everyday
language, and on the other hand, the objects or concepts are  introduced
whith those names.

"prone/supine"  are all the contrary, they intent to reflect in everyday
language just one aspect of an existing concept which has many, and more
important, they are used in place of a well stablished name.

all this has nothing to do with  "young field" as opposed to "mature
subject"

silly names (if any) in physics would be as bad as in any other subject

do not confuse  things, I found  the  "Scott is sober" an exelent example
of humor that does not undermine respect for the field. Another exelent
example that comes to my mind is M. Barr's "The point of the empty set"
