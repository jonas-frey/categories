Samuel Eilenberg Centenary Conference

Warszawa (Warsaw), Poland, July 22-26, 2013

Preliminary Announcement

Samuel Eilenberg, one of mathematicians who shaped 20th century
mathematics and made
important contributions to theoretical computer science, was born in
Warsaw on September 30, 1913.
The Centenary Conference will be held in the city of his birth July
22-26, 2013.
The intention is to cover all the areas of Eilenberg's great
contributions: topology, category
theory and computability. The categorical viewpoint developed by
Eilenberg and his collaborators lies
behind many recent developments, thus the conference will be of
relevance to a large body of current
research in mathematics. The program of the Conference will consist of
plenary lectures and
contributed talks covering the wide scope of Eilenberg's mathematical
legacy. Some historical materials
will be presented to illustrate social context of his life.

The conference venue will be the old campus of the University of Warsaw,
Alma Mater of
Samuel Eilenberg. Already as a student Eilenberg was one of the most
active members of the Warsaw
topology group - he left Warsaw in April 1939, thus escaping the
Holocaust. After several short
employments at institutions in the USA, in 1947 Eilenberg settled at
Columbia University, where he
stayed until retirement in 1982. He was a member of the Polish and
American Mathematical Societies
and of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Samuel Eilenberg was an
extraordinary personality; he was
also a famous collector and expert in Southeast Asian art. He donated
his impressive collection to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

The Conference is organized by the University of Warsaw, Polish
Mathematical Society and the
Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in
collaboration with the American
Mathematical Society and Columbia University. On the occasion of the
conference a special volume
of Fundamenta Mathematicae will appear, the journal in which Eilenberg
published many papers,
including his first (in 1934) and the last (in 1988) topological papers.
The First Announcement will be distributed later in Fall . The webpage
of the conference is:
eilenberg100.ptm.org.pl . For more information please contact the
secretary of the local organizing
committee Marek.Zawadowski@mimuw.edu.pl .
