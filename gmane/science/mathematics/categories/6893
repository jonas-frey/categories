                       CMCS 2012 call for papers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=

The 11th International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Scienc=
e
               31 March - 1 April 2012, Tallinn, Estonia
                      (co-located with ETAPS 2012)
                          www.coalg.org/cmcs12

            *** Proceedings to be published in Springer LNCS ***

Aims and scope
--------------

In more than a decade of research, it has been established that a wide
variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition systems,
automata (including weighted and probabilistic variants), Markov
chains, and game-based systems, can be treated uniformly as
coalgebras. Coalgebra has developed into a field of its own interest
presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a growing field of
applications, and interactions with various other fields such as
reactive and interactive system theory, object-oriented and concurrent
programming, formal system specification, modal and description
logics, artificial intelligence, dynamical systems, control systems,
category theory, algebra, analysis, etc. The aim of the CMCS workshop
series is to bring together researchers with a common interest in the
theory of coalgebras, their logics, and their applications.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

  * the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
    approaches);
  * coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
    languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
  * coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
  * coalgebras and data types;
  * (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
    bisimulations or invariants);
  * coalgebras and algebras;
  * coalgebraic specification and verification;
  * coalgebras and (modal) logic;
  * coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid
    systems).


Keynote Speaker
---------------

Samson Abramsky, Oxford University, UK

Invited Speakers
----------------

Marcello Bonsangue,  Leiden University, The Netherlands
Pawel Sobocinski, University of Southampton, UK

Submissions
-----------

Submission is electronic via the easychair system at

  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcmcs2012

following the submission guidelines below. We solicit two types of
contributions:

(a) Regular papers to be evaluated by the PC for publication in the
proceedings:

They must have a length of at most 20 pages, formatted in LNCS
style (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html).  They must
contain original contributions, be clearly written, and include
appropriate reference to and comparison with related work.

(b) Short contributions:

These will not be published in the proceedings but will be bundled in
a technical report. They should be no more than two pages in LNCS
format and may describe work in progress, summarise work submitted to
a conference or workshop elsewhere, or in some other way appeal to
the CMCS audience.


Proceedings Publication
-----------------------

The proceedings of CMCS 2012 will be published in Springer Lecture
Notes in Computer Science. The final proceedings will be published
post-conference and consist of revised versions of the accepted regular
papers. Preliminary proceedings will be made available at the
conference in electronic form.

Depending on the number and quality of submissions, we will consider
publishing extended and revised papers as a journal special issue,
subject to the usual reviewing procedure. Previous special issues of
CMCS have appeared in high-ranking journals including Information and
Computation and Theoretical Computer Science.
