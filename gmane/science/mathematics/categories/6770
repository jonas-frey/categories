Dear Michael=2C
I remind you that it was Benabou who observed (and proved) the equivalence =
between=A0anafunctors and representable distributors=2C reproduced in the n=
Lab as "folklore"=2C from which I concluded (without any knowledge of anafu=
nctors) that the stack completion of a category C in S represents anafuncto=
rs with target C. I am glad that Makkai is now aware of this fact=2C which =
gives a universal flavor to his subject=2C whatever "morally" means.=A0I kn=
ow nothing about the "axiom of cardinal selection".=A0

As for there being an example of an elementaru topos which does not satisfy=
  the "axiom of stack compleitons"=2C Joyal gave one lomg ago and Lawvere me=
ntioned it in his 1974 Montreal lectures. Take a group G with a proper clas=
s of subgroups having a small index in G. The topos [G=2C Sets] is an examp=
le.=A0Also=2C so far as I know=2C it is not yet known (Hyland=2C Robinson=
=2C and Rosolini=2C"The discrete objects in the effective topos"=2C Proc. L=
ondon Math. Soc. (3) 60 (1990=2C 1-36)) whether the full internal subcatego=
ry Q on the subquotients of N in Eff (the effective topos) has an internal =
stack completion. The stack completion is identified as Orth(Delta 2)=2C fa=
milies of discrete objects.=A0
=A0Regards=2CMarta
