Introduction

GaLoP is an annual international workshop on game-semantic models for =20=

logics and programming languages and their applications. This is an =20
informal workshop that welcomes work in progress, overviews of more =20
extensive work, programmatic or position papers and tutorials as well =20=

as contributed papers and invited talks.

Contributions are invited on all pertinent subjects, with particular =20
interest in compositional game-semantic models. Typical but not =20
exclusive areas of interest are:

     * categorical aspects;
     * algorithmic aspects;
     * programming languages and full abstraction;
     * semantics of logics and proof systems;
     * proof search;
     * higher-order automata;
     * program verification and model checking;
     * program analysis;
     * security;
     * theories of concurrency;
     * probabilistic models.

Publication

This is intended to be an informal workshop without widely =20
distributed proceedings. We therefore ask for submission both of =20
short abstracts outlining what will be presented at the workshop and =20
of longer papers describing completed work, either published or =20
unpublished, in the relevant areas.

A special issue of the journal Annals of Pure and Applied Logic =20
associated with the workshop will be discussed at the workshop.
