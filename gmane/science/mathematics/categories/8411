                     CALL FOR PAPERS

              The 12th International Workshop on
               Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)

             July 13-17, Oxford, United Kingdom

                http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/qpl2015


The 12th International Workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)
will take place at the Department of Computer Science of the University
of Oxford between Wednesday 15 and Friday 17 July, 2015. The
workshop will be preceded by tutorials on Monday 13 and
Tuesday 14 July 2015.

This workshop brings together researchers working on mathematical
  foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, spatio-temporal
causal structures, and related areas such as computational linguistics.
Of particular interest are topics that use logical tools, ordered algebraic
and category-theoretic structures, formal languages, semantical
methods and other computer science methods for the study of physical
behaviour in general.

Previous QPL events were held in Kyoto (2014), Barcelona (2013),
Brussels (2012), Nijmegen (2011), Oxford (2010), Oxford (2009),
Reykjavik (2008), Oxford (2006), Chicago (2005), Turku (2004),
and Ottawa (2003).



INVITED SPEAKERS

Paul Busch (University of York)
Dan Browne (University College London)
Chris Douglas (University of Oxford)


TUTORIALS

Paul Busch (University of York): Quantum uncertainty
Dan Browne (University College London): Teleportation and measurement-
                                                             based computation
Oscar Dahlsten (University of Oxford): Entropy and majorisation in
                                                        generalised
probabilistic theories

IMPORTANT DATES

Submission Deadline: May 1, 2015
Notification of Acceptance: June 1
Papers Ready: June 15
Tutorials: July 13-14
Workshop: July 15-17


SUBMISSIONS

Prospective speakers are invited to submit a contribution to the workshop.

  - *Short contributions* consist of a 3 page description of the work,
     and a link to a paper published elsewhere.

  - Longer *original contributions* consist of a 5-12 page extended
     abstract which provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine
     interest and provides sufficient detail to allow the program
     committee to assess the merits of the work. Submissions of works
     in progress are encouraged but must be more substantial than a
     research proposal.

Extended versions of accepted original research contributions will be
published in Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science
(EPTCS) after the workshop.

Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX, and must be submitted
in PDF format. Use of the EPTCS style is encouraged. Submission is done
via EasyChair: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qpl2015

There will be an award for the best paper whose authors are all students,
at the discretion of the programme committee.


REGISTRATION

Please visit the website to register. We encourage participation by
graduate students, and will be able to provide limited reimbursement
to partially support students for travel and accommodation. Further
information is found on the workshop website.
