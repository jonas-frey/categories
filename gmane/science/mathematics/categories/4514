There are common  words, rarely used in a technical sense,
that however may be useful as explanatory marginal
alternatives of foreign words. The "ab...ment d.. " being
discussed seems to be explained by  "goal", as in
       f is the goal of F
where F is the Fourer series of a function f (which leaves to
particular investigation the question of actual convergence).

In turn "goal" can be helpfully explained as=20
             purpose
a concept that academic discussions should not forget.
