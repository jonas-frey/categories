  Tom A. Henzinger (IST, Austria) and=20
  Joost-Pieter Katoen (RWTH Aachen University, Germany)

- Abstract submission: 29 March 2010

=3D=3D=3D Scope =3D=3D=3D

Interaction and Concurrency Experiences (ICEs) is a series of=20
international scientific meetings oriented to theoretical=20
computer science researchers with special interest in models,=20
verification, tools and programming primitives for complex interactions.=20

The general scope is to include theoretical and applied aspects of=20
interactions and the synchronization mechanisms used among actors of=20
concurrent/distributed systems, but every experience will focus on a=20
different specific topic which affects several areas of computer science.=
=20

The theme of ICE'10 is ***Guaranteed Interactions***, like guaranteeing=20
safety, responsiveness, quality of service levels or satisfaction of=20
analysis hypotheses. In this context, coordination can be viewed as=20
imposing constraints on the interaction among the actors. Such constraint=
s=20
and guarantees of their satisfaction play an important role in the=20
analysis of distributed systems. In order to provide such guarantees, a=20
number of directions are being explored to develop appropriate models,=20
methodologies and tools, like behavioural types, component-based model=20
checking, assume-guarantee and =E2=80=9Cby construction=E2=80=9D techniqu=
es such as glue=20
synthesis. Considering interaction as a first class entity is crucial for=
=20
overcoming complexity issues of distributed systems, such as state space=20
explosion.=20

Topics of interest include, but shall not be limited to:

- logic and types for interactions
- concurrent models and semantics
- techniques and tools for specification, analysis, verification of
  guaranteed interaction
- programming primitives for interactions
- languages, protocols and mechanisms for sound coordination
- "by construction" guarantees for interaction
- expressiveness results
- formal contract languages
- disciplined interactions inspired by emerging computational models
  (systems biology, quantum computing, etc.)

=3D=3D=3D Selection Procedure =3D=3D=3D

The workshop proposes an innovative paper selection mechanism based on an=
=20
interactive discussion amongst authors and PC members. As witnessed by th=
e=20
past two editions of ICE, this considerably improves the accuracy of the=20
feedback from reviews, the fairness of the selection, the quality of=20
accepted papers, and the discussion during the workshop.

During the review phase, each submitted paper is published on a Wiki and=20
associated with a discussion forum whose access will be restricted to the=
=20
authors and to all the PC members not in conflict of interests. The PC=20
members post comments / questions which the authors shall reply to.

=3D=3D=3D The Public Wiki =3D=3D=3D

After the notification, the accepted papers will be published on a public=
=20
forum, the rationale being to initiate public discussions that will=20
trigger and stimulate the scientific debate of the workshop. We argue tha=
t=20
this will drive the workshop discussions and let perspective participants=
=20
to interact with each other well in advance with respect to the modus=20
operandi of more traditional events.

=3D=3D=3D Submission Guidelines =3D=3D=3D

Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be=20
simultaneously submitted to other conferences / workshops with=20
refereed proceedings. The ICE'10 post-proceedings will be published in=20
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science
(http://eptcs.org/). Depending on the quality of submissions a special is=
sue in
a journal will be considered.

Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair=20
(http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dice2010) and should not=20
exceed 15 pages with EPTCS style (http://style.eptcs.org/).=20

Accepted papers must be presented at the workshop by one of the authors.
