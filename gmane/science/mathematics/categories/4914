Dear colleagues,

The deadline for application to the postdoctoral position
in our laboratory PPS (University Paris Diderot) has been
postponed to June the 15th.

The announcement follows.

Paul-Andre


======================================================
             Postdoctoral position in PPS
             (CNRS & University Paris 7)
         Curry-Howard and Concurrency Theory
======================================================

A 12-month postdoctoral position is available within
the Laboratory PPS (Preuves Programmes Systemes)
located at University Paris 7 Denis Diderot:
http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/

The position is supported by the research project
Curry-Howard and Concurrency Theory (CHOCO)
funded by the French national research agency ANR.
http://choco.pps.jussieu.fr/

Important dates:
- deadline for application:            June 15th 2009
- notification:                        June 29th 2009
- suggested starting date:             September 1st 2009

Application procedure.
Full application should be sent before May 31st 2009 including a resume,
a short research project (1 page) and two names of possible references.
This should be preferably done by email or at the postal address below.
For all correspondance use the contact addresses:

postdoc-choco@pps.jussieu.fr
Paul-Andre Mellies
Laboratoire PPS
Universite Paris 7 - Denis Diderot
Case 7014
75205 Paris Cedex 13 FRANCE

The net salary will be around 2000 euro/month before income tax.
The starting date for the postdoctoral position is September 2009
although later dates may be also considered.

Description
The general purpose of the project CHOCO is to investigate
the syntactic, semantic and algebraic aspects of proof theory
in order to integrate concurrency theory in the Curry-Howard
correspondence between proofs and programs.

The interdisciplinary nature of the project between proof theory
and concurrency theory means that candidates from various
scientific horizons are welcome to apply. On the other hand,
we will consider with special interest applications by candidates
with background in one or several of the fields:
- linear logic (proof nets, geometry of interaction)
- semantics (game semantics, vectorial semantics)
- concurrency theory (process calculi, presheaf semantics)
- type theory (realizability, types for process calculi)
- rewriting theory (lambda-calculus, diagrammatic rewriting)
- category theory (categorical algebra, topos theory)
The applicant should hold a PhD or be about to defend
his/her PhD thesis by December 2009.

The postdoc researcher will work within the laboratory PPS
(Preuves, Programmes, Systemes)
      http://www.pps.jussieu.fr
which is internationally recognized as one of the leading
research laboratories in mathematics and computer science,
with its distinctive proof-theoretic culture.

The laboratory PPS is located in Chevaleret, the largest research
community of mathematicians in France. The laboratory PPS
is also part of the Fondation Sciences Mathematiques de Paris.
http://www.sciencesmath-paris.fr

Strong interaction of the postdoc researcher with the partner sites
of the CHOCO project is also expected:
- Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris Nord.
- Laboratoire d'Informatique du Parallelisme, Lyon,
- Laboratoire de Mathematiques de l'Universite de Savoie, Chambery
- Institut de Mathematiques de Luminy, Marseille,
- Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Marseille,
Further information will possibly be made available
from the web page of the project indicated above.
