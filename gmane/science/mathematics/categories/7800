CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Third International Symposium on
Foundations of Health Information Engineering and Systems
http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/FHIES2013/

International Institute for Software Technology
United Nations University, Macau
21st-23rd August, 2013


AIMS

The purpose of the symposium series on Foundations of Health Informatio=
n Engineering and Systems is to promote a nascent research area that ai=
ms to develop and apply theories and methods from a variety of discipli=
nes for the purpose of modeling, building and certifying software-inten=
sive ICT systems in healthcare. A particular objective of FHIES is to e=
xplicitly include a focus on healthcare ICT applications in the develop=
ing world (in addition to systems used in the developed countries), sin=
ce unique engineering challenges arise in that special setting. Because=
  humans often play a pivotal role in the process of using such systems,=
  theories from the human factors engineering community may need to be i=
ntegrated with methods from the technology-oriented domains in order to=
  create effective engineering methodologies for socio-technical systems=
  in the healthcare domain. Previous FHIES symposia were held in 2011, i=
n Mabalingwe ZA (with post-conference proceedings in Springer LNCS 7151=
), and in 2012, in Paris FR (with post-conference proceedings in Spring=
er LNCS 7789).


REGISTRATION

Registration is now open for FHIES 2013. The early registration deadlin=
e and the hotel reservation deadline are both 6th August 2013: after th=
at point, the registration fee rises, and the reserved hotel rooms are =
released. The symposium has grown to three days; in addition to three k=
eynote speakers and 19 accepted submissions, there will be two panel di=
scussions, and a full programme of social events. For more information,=
  including a link to the registration site, please visit the conference=
  webpage.
