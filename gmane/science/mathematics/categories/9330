Preparing a stir fry for last Sunday's lunch is when I received Marta's mes=
sage saying we had lost Fred. I realized that our family was introduced to =
this wonderful style of cooking by Fred Linton in his big New Haven house. =
I was on sabbatical 1976-7 at Wesleyan University in Middletown (CT) to wor=
k with Fred. The year was a hard one for Fred but he was a great host. We r=
ented a nice University-owned house in Middletown, with bushy slope one sid=
e and a disused car park the other, so our two boys could toboggan or ride =
their tag-sale-acquired tricycle, according to season. Our older boy starte=
d school that year. Fred had found a microscope at a tag sale which is a gi=
ft my boys often talk about. He also found books, fruits, vegies and other =
things he rightly thought would interest us.

One day he took me to a liquor store in New Haven where he knew they had Au=
stralian beer. They had \Huge{cans} of Fosters. The shopkeeper, not knowing=
  at first my nationality, told me that, in Australia, they bought these by =
the 6 pack and got through many of them at their barbies! Fosters was a Mel=
bourne company, uncommon in Sydney in those days; I gave him the benefit of=
  the doubt.   =20

I may have met Fred in November 1968 at a MidWest Category Seminar in Urban=
a, Illinois; there were so many of the category theorists who had just been=
  names on papers to me before that. However, we certainly met at the Summer=
  of '69 Bowdoin College, Maine, gathering. Fred gave a series of lectures o=
n enriching the theory of triples (monads), especially over bases that were=
  either closed or monoidal but not necessarily both. I had been thinking ab=
out the closed monoidal case over the previous year so it was great to find=
  a mind who also found it worth doing that even more generally.     =20

The MR review Fred wrote of my ``formal theory of monads'' paper was notice=
d (before me I think) by our Head (Fred Chong) at the time. This was respon=
sible in large part for my application for a full year's sabbatical at Midd=
letown being smiled upon. Yes, Fred had a way with words!

We category theorists have enjoyed Fred's company and discussions in many m=
eetings around the world. We all will miss his valuable contributions.
