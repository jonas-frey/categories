If pi is a group, are the categories of right pi-modules and of 2-sided
pi-modules equivalent?

The reason I raise this question is that I was looking at Example 5, p.
43 in the TAC reprint of Jon Beck's thesis.  He identifies the abelian
group objects of Gp/pi as right pi-modules via the following
construction.  Let M be a right pi-module and let Y = pi x M with
multiplication (x,m)(x',m') = (xx',m+m'x).  This is an abelian group
object in Gp/pi and for any Z --> pi, Hom(Z,Y) = Der(Z,M) the group of
derivations d: Z --> M meaning that d(zz') = (dz)z' + d(z').  Here M
becomes a right Z-module using the map Z --> Y.  For the converse, if Y
--> pi is an abelian group object in Gp/pi, then the kernel of the map
is an abelian normal subgroup M of Y and the conjugation action of Y on
M descends to pi since M is abelian and this conjugation action is a
right pi-module structure (see Beck's thesis for all details).

But suppose M is a 2-sided pi-module.  Now let Y = pi x M and define
(x,m)(x',m') = (xx',mx'+xm').  This is just as above an abelian group
structure in Gp/pi.  For any Z --> pi, Hom(Z,Y) = Der(Z,M) as above but
now Der means 2-sided derivations d(zz') = (dz)z' + z(dz'), still an
abelian group.  But the kernel of Y --> pi is M but now with a new right
module structure m*x = x^{-1}mx.  So there is a functor from 2-sided to
right modules by replacing the 2-sided operation by conjugation which is
now a right operation, but could this possibly be an equivalence?  I
don't see how.
