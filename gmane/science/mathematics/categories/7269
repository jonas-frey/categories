  Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop
  bringing together researchers in mathematics and computer science
  with a focus on the application of category theory in computer
  science.

  This year's meeting will be hosted in the Department of Mathematics
  and Statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.

  There will be an informal welcoming reception in the evening of June
  13, starting at 5:30. The scientific program starts on June 14, and
  consists of four tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to
  category theory, as well as two and a half days of research talks.
  There will be an excursion on one of the afternoons, and a conference
  dinner on Friday. The meeting ends at mid-day on June 17.

TUTORIAL LECTURES:

  There will be four tutorial lectures, presented by:

  * Robin Cockett (Calgary)
  * Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine (Dalhousie)
  * Ernie Manes (Massachusetts)
  * Simona Paoli (Leicester)

  will be considered on a space-available basis. All submissions will
  be acknowledged by return email.

ACCOMMODATIONS:

  We have reserved a block of rooms in Alexandra Hall at the King's
  College residences (marked in green on the interactive map
  above). The rate, including taxes, is $45 per night for a single
  room, and $65 for a double room. Reservations can be made by sending
  an e-mail to tim.ross@ukings.ca including your name, address, dates,
  and a credit card number, or calling (902)422-1275, ext 106. It's
  best to reserve this soon, as there are several big meetings in
  Halifax around this time, and we don't know when it might be filling
  up.

  For those wishing to stay in a hotel or bed & breakfast, some
  information is available on the conference website.

REGISTRATION:

  Please register for the meeting by emailing selinger@mathstat.dal.ca.
  There will be an on-site registration fee of $100 to cover meeting
  costs. A discounted registration fee is available for students and
