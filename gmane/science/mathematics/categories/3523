CALCO brings together researchers and practitioners to exchange new
results related to foundational aspects and both traditional and
emerging uses of algebras and coalgebras in computer science.

This is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces
and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods
in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development
Techniques). The first CALCO conference took place 2005 in Swansea,
Wales (http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/calco/index.php), and was a huge success.
The second event will take place August 2007 in Bergen, Norway.

CALCO 2007 will be preceded by two events on August 20, 2007.

   * CALCO-jnr - a CALCO Young Researchers Workshop dedicated to
     presentations by PhD students and by those who completed
     their doctoral studies within the past few years.
     See separate announcements for CALCO-jnr.

   * CALCO Tools Day - providing the opportunity to give
     system demonstrations. See below for more information.

There are separate submission procedures for the CALCO main conference,
CALCO-jnr and CALCO Tools Day, respectively.


Topics of Interest
------------------
We invite submissions of technical papers that report results of
theoretical work on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the
way these results can support methods and techniques for software
development, as well as experience with the transfer of resulting
technologies into industrial practice. We encourage submissions in
topics included or related to those in the lists below.

   * Abstract models and logics
     - Automata and languages,
     - Categorical semantics,
     - Modal logics,
     - Relational systems,
     - Graph transformation,
     - Term rewriting,
     - Adhesive categories

   * Specialised models and calculi
     - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems,
     - Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed,
       mobile, and context-aware computing,
     - General systems theory and computational models
       (chemical, biological, etc)

   * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
     - Abstract data types,
     - Inductive and coinductive methods,
     - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation),
     - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques,
     - Semantics of programming languages

   * System specification and verification
     - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification,
     - Formal testing and quality assurance,
     - Validation and verification,
     - Generative programming and model-driven development,
     - Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
       hardware/middleware/architectures,
     - Process algebra


Submission Guidelines
---------------------
Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Experience papers
are welcome, but they must clearly present general lessons learned
that would be of interest and benefit to a broad audience of both
researchers and practitioners. As in 2005, it is planned to publish
the proceedings in the Springer LNCS series. Final papers will be
no more than 15 pages long in the format specified by Springer. It
is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length
(see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). Submissions that
are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Proofs omitted due
to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.
Both an abstract and the full paper must be submitted by their respective
submission deadlines.  Paper submissions should be made electronically
at
http://sttt.cs.uni-dortmund.de/calco07/servlet/Conference

A special issue of the new high-quality open access journal Logical
Methods in Computer Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), consisting of
extended versions of selected papers will be produced after the conference
if there are enough good papers that can be extended and revised to the
standards of this journal.

Location and Organisation
-------------------------
Bergen was Norway's first capital from the 13th century, and up until the
1830's Norway's biggest town. Its placement has made it a natural point
through which foreign influences penetrated to Norway and Scandinavia
and the Norwegian export was leaving the country. For some centuries it
was part of the Hanseatic League with export of fish and timber. Many
of the wooden houses and larger facilities from the Hanseatic times
survived fires and modernisation and make up today a charming town
center.  Nowadays Bergen is small by international standards, but it
has always been a meeting place for people and a centre for commerce
and culture. Spectacular fjords and mountains surrounding the town,
combined with a lively and sociable atmosphere, make it a worthwhile
place to visit.

The conference will be held at Grand Hotel Terminus in the centre of
Bergen. The hotel will handle room bookings individually.  A social
programme will complement the scientific event.

Sponsored by Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen
University College, and IFIP WG1.3 on Foundations of System
Specification. Further sponsorships pending.


CALCO Tools Day
---------------
A special day at CALCO'07 is dedicated to tools based on algebraic
and coalgebraic principles. These include systems/prototypes/tools
developed specifically for design, checking, execution, and verification
of (co)algebraic specifications, but also tools targeting different
application domains but making core or interesting use of (co)algebraic
techniques. Tool submissions should be no longer than 5 pages in the
LNCS format; the accepted tool papers will be included in the final
LNCS proceedings of the conference.  The tools should be available on
the web for download and evaluation. Each submission will be evaluated
by at least three reviewers; one or more of the reviewers will be asked
to download and run the tool. At least one of the authors of each tool
paper must attend the conference to demo the tool.
Submissions by e-mail to grosu@cs.uiuc.edu.

Important Dates (all in 2007)
February 17      Tools software and paper submissions due
March 28         Author notification
May 16           Camera ready due
August 20        CALCO Tools Day
