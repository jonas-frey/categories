I am forwarding this to the categories list, where I am sure there will be
many answers, but I have never myself delved into these interesting
questions.  Please be sure to copy your answers to him (although he should
probably subscribe to the list).

Subject: categorical "varieties of algebras"

Dear Prof. Barr,


My name is Alexandru Chirvasitu, and I am a first-year mathematics graduate
student at UC Berkeley. I apologize for bothering you wih this, especially
since you don't know me, but I was kind of at a loss: I don't really know
any people working in the areas I am interested in personally, so I thought
I'd give this a go :). I'm quite sure you'll be able to clear this out
straight away.

Before coming to Berkeley, I was interested in applying category-theoretic
methods to study coalgebras, Hopf algebras, and other such creatures:

http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2881

It became clear later on that to get some further insight into the universal
constructions useful for these problems (Hopf envelopes of co (or bi)
algebras, free Hopf algebra with bijective antipode on a Hopf algebra,
etc.), it would be useful to apply some Tannaka reconstruction techniques
and move the free constructions "up the categorical ladder": free monoidal
category on a category, (left) rigid envelope of a monoidal category, etc.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any results stating clearly (clearly for
someone who is perhaps not *too* familiar with the higher categorical
machinery) that such free categories always exist. Of course, the few
constructions I needed can easily be done by hand, but what I had in mind
was some kind of higher categorical analogue of the fact that the forgetful
functor from a variety of algebras to another variety of algebras with
"fewer operations" has a left adjoint.

There's also an issue of how strict things should be. For what I was doing,
the following setting is typical: consider the category whose objects are
(not necessarily strict, but that's not very important here) monoidal
categories with a specified left dual and specified (co)evaluation maps for
every object, and whose morphisms are the functors which preserve all of
this structure *strictly*. Then I wanted to conclude that the forgetful
functor from this to *Cat* has a left adjoint, which should be easy enough.

To state my question properly, I'm thinking about a category whose objects
are categories *C* endowed with certain "operations", consisting of functors
from *C^n x (C opposite)^m* to *C* (example: the specified left dual in the
above example is a contravariant functor), appropriately natural
transformations between such functors (example: the evaluation maps in a
rigid tensor category as above form, together, a dinatural transformation),
and equations involving these natural transformations; the morphisms are
functors which preserve all the structure *strictly*. Consider the forgetful
functor from this to a similar category, but with "fewer operations" (this
could easily be made precise). Then, is there a  result stating that such a
functor always has a left adjoint?

I expect it should be easy enough to employ a form of the Adjoint Functor
Theorem (working with universes say, to have everything set-theoretically
sound) to prove something like this, and I was thinking about writing it up
for further reference. My problem was that I can't seem to be able to tell
exactly what is well-known and has been written up, what is folklore and
trivial, etc. Also, even though a statement as outlined above and to which I
could refer would be completely satisfactory, I realize that after
destrictification things become much more interesting, and you probably get
some neat bicategorical results.

I must once again apologize for intruding on your time like this, for the
potential silliness of a newbie's question, and for the ramble factor and
length of this message :). I hope you do get to reply.


Thank you,


Alexandru
