Dear category theorists,

Many thanks for the responses to my question. I now have no doubt that =
the "right" way of defining M-filtered monad, where M is an ordered =
monoid, is as a lax monoidal functor as described by John Baez below. I =
admit that it doesn't capture every aspect of the examples I gave, but =
that's OK -- general definitions never do.

So then the precise form of my original question would then be whether =
there is a reference, suitable for a non-category-theoretic paper, where =
this definition is written down purely in the language of functors and =
natural transformations. Since the monoidal category language is so =
useful here, such a reference probably wouldn't have been written by a =
category theorist. But since filtered monads are so common even in =
contexts where people don't talk much about monoidal categories, it =
*should* exist. So if anyone happens to know of one, please let me know.

Yours,

James Borger
