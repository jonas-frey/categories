Dear categorists,

A standard method for doing logic in category theory is, as far I as
know, by imposing more and more conditions on the subobject posets
Sub(X), which are equivalence classes of monomorphisms with X as the
codomain.

By adding more and more assumptions of this kind one gets more and more
powerful internal logics. The connection between predicates and
functions does not arise in all these stages as long as one does not
request existence of the subobject classifier (therefore almost
certainly turning the whole thing into a topos).

What I am wondering about is whether an alternative approach have ever
been developed, namely by postulating an internal truth-value object
Omega, by introducing predicates as exponentials Omega^X, and so forth.

I would expect, if such an idea have ever been developed it would yield
one of the many ways to provide foundations to the topos theory. The
fact that is not well-known sort of indicates that it is probably not
such a robust idea, in which case I would be grateful if someone would
explain me why.

The only approach to topos theory I know, which might be relevant here
is the one by allegories. Starting from a category C with a
distinguished object Omega (say, internal Heyting algebra) we can
introduce an allegory having the same object as C and as morphisms A->B
those of C having form A x B -> Omega. Antiinvolution would then follow
by swapping the arguments, and the intersection can be made deducible
from the axiomatic structure of Omega. The question is, of course, the
modular law, and the conditions under which it would follow. Has anyone
studied that?

I would be very grateful for any hints and/or references on the subject.

Best regards,
