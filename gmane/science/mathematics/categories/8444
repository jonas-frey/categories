Dear Mike,

i'm not sure why, but my email to the categories list is not getting
through. Do you think you might be able to post this question on my
behalf?

i'm writing to ask a question about higher categories motivated from
the computer
science perspective. A colleague and i have been looking at an analogue of the
internalization of morphisms typically associated with Currying. In our setting
we're modeling rewrites in various calculi as 2-morphisms, but to
prevent rewrites
from happening too freely we have to reify certain contexts as
1-morphisms to mark
which rewrites are permitted. Essentially, it's a kind of
internalization process
and is closely connected with work by Leifer, Milner, and Sewell.
Now, though, i'm wondering if there has been a more general study of
internalization operators
taking n-cells to (n-1)-cells. Is there essentially only one kind of
internalization process generalizing the exponential object case? Does
anyone have any references?

Best wishes,

--greg

Dear Tom,

No worries. Thanks for getting back to me. It appears that this is not
only an unanswered question, but an unasked one! ;-) However, given
that the 1-cell to 0-cell case, namely exponential objects play such a
pivotal role in computing and fairly important roles even in
mainstream maths it seems like it might be worthwhile for me to ask it
and seek some answers.

Best wishes in the New Year,

--greg
