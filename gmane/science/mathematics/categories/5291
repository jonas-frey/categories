		Graduate Student and Postdoc positions
	    Category Theory and Foundations of Computation

		Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada

The category theory group in the Department of Mathematics and
Statistics at Dalhousie University invites applications from
prospective graduate students and/or postdoctoral researchers,
for positions starting in September 2010.

The group includes the following potential supervisors:
 Bob Pare       http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~pare/

 Dorette Pronk  http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/Faculty/pronk.htm
 Peter Selinger http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/

We seek applications in the following areas:

 * any area of pure and applied category theory

 * semantics of programming languages

 * quantum computing

The successful candidates will participate in the activities of our
group, and will be part of the Atlantic Category Theory Group, which
includes faculty, postdocs, and students from Dalhousie University,
Saint Mary's University, and Mount Allison University. See
http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/atcat/.

Postdoc applications must be completed by December 15. If you plan to
apply, please contact one of us by email no later than December 1, as
some internal paperwork needs to be completed before the deadline.
