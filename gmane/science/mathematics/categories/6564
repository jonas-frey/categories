Sets Within Geometry, An International Symposium

Nancy, France 27-30 July 2011, Archives Henri Poincare Maison Sciences =20=

De L=E2=80=99Homme


First Announcement and Call for Submitted Papers



The Theory of Sets, founded in the last quarter of the 19th Century by =20=

Georg Cantor, underwent rapid development at the hands of many =20
contributors.

Within that develoment, several distinct lines can be traced, and =20
these have connected in contrasting ways with the subsequent overall =20
development of mathematical knowledge.  The aim of this Symposium is =20
to study and compare these, with particular focus on the question how =20=

far set theory might be re-conceived as a fragment of Geometry
For  a more extended discussion of the manner in which this question =20
naturally arises from the study of these various lines of =20
development,  see the website of this Meeting at

=
http://www.archmathsciphil.com/conferences-and-workshops/symposium-sets-wi=
thin-geometry-nancy-france-27-30-july-2011-2/=20
.


The confirmed Speakers so far are:


Professor FW Lawvere.(Buffalo)
Professor Yuri I. Manin (Bonn and IHES)
Professor Anders Kock (Aarhus)

Professor Christian Houzel (Paris)

Professor Colin McLarty (CWRU Cleveland)
Professor Jean-Pierre Marquis (Montreal)
Professor Alberto Peruzzi (Florence)


By way of orientation, the organisers of the Symposium offer the =20
following statement of aims


=E2=80=94oOo=E2=80=94

Those who have come together to organise this Symposium believe that =20
the ultimate aim of foundational efforts is to provide clarifying =20
guidance to teaching and research in mathematics, by concentrating the =20=

essential aspects of past such endeavors. By mathematics we mean the =20
investigation of the Relations between Space and Quantity, of the =20
reflected relations between quantity and quantity and between space =20
and space, and the development of our knowledge of these in other =20
words Geometry.
Using tools developed by Cantor and his contemporaries, much more =20
explicit forms of the relation between space and quantity were =20
developed in the 1930s in the field of functional analysis by Stone =20
and Gelfand, partly through the notion of Spectrum (a space =20
corresponding to a given system of quantities). In the 1950s =20
Grothendieck applied those
same tools, around the notion of Spectrum, to algebraic geometry by =20
using and developing the further powerful tool of category theory . =20
Further developments have strongly suggested that it is now possible =20
to incorporate the whole set-theoretic =E2=80=9Cfoundation=E2=80=9D of  =
Geometry, =20
explicitly as part of that space-quantity dialectic, in other words as =20=

a chapter in an extended Algebraic Geometry.

Details of Registration and Titles and Abstracts of the Invited =20
Speakers and other information about the venue and arrangements for =20
the Symposium will be available shortly on

.



=E2=80=94oOo=E2=80=94



The  Topics of the Symposium fall under three broad headings : =20
Mathematics =E2=80=93 Conceptual Analysis =E2=80=93 History



1. Mathematics
Examination of Mathematical Developments yielding a deeper =20
understanding of the place of sets in mathematics.

2. Conceptual Analysis
The connection between these Mathematical developments and broader =20
analysis of the epistemological sources of mathematical ideas. One =20
illustration of such analysis is the investigation of the meaning of =20
Extensionality and Choice principles in the setting of Topos Theory

3. History
Related Historical investigations such as a re-examination of the work =20=

of
Cantor and Dedekind and other figures and discussion of different
approaches to the Continuum Hypothesis.

=E2=80=94oOo=E2=80=94


CONTRIBUTED TALKS and POSTER SESSIONS
Proposals for Talks relevant to the Themes of the Meeting are welcome =20=

and Titles and Abstracts of such proposed talks should be sent no =20
later than May 1st to the Secretary of the Organising Committee  =20
Michael Wright,
Archive of Mathematical Sciences:
mike.wright@archmathsci.org

Abstracts should be no more than 400 words but can be shorter.
Anyone submitting a proposed talk is asked first to study the extended =20=

announcement on the website for guidance as to whether their proposed =20=

talk may be relevant to the themes of the Symposium.

In order to accommodate as many Speakers as possible, Contributed =20
Talks (Talks by other than the Invited Speakers ) will be of 30 =20
minutes,  including discussion time. There will be no parallel sessions.

A Second Announcement will be made by May 1st 2011. The site will be =20
regularly updated with Titles and Abstracts of Invited Talks and other =20=

Information.

Those submitting proposals for Contributed Talks will be advised no =20
later than May 30th 2011 if their talks have been accepted for =20
inclusion in the Program.=
