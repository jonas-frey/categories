                           Seattle, WA, USA
                          August 12-14, 2006
	            Affiliated workshops Aug 11 & 15


The 17th International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications
(RTA'06) is organized as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC),
collocated with CAV, ICLP, IJCAR, LICS, SAT, and several affiliated workshops.

RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects of
rewriting. Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited to):
 * Applications: case studies; rule-based (functional and logic) programming;
   symbolic and algebraic computation; theorem proving; system synthesis and
   verification; proof checking; reasoning about programming languages and
   logics;
 * Foundations: matching and unification; narrowing; completion techniques;
   strategies; constraint solving; explicit substitutions; tree automata;
   termination;
 * Frameworks: string, term, graph, and proof rewriting; lambda-calculus and
   higher-order rewriting; proof nets; constrained rewriting/deduction;
   categorical and infinitary rewriting;
 * Implementation: compilation techniques; parallel execution; rewrite tools;
   termination checking;
 * Semantics: equational logic; rewriting logic.

INVITED TALKS:
 * Randy Bryant (jointly with LICS and SAT):
      Formal Verification of Infinite State Systems using Boolean Methods
 * Javier Esparza:
      Rewriting Models of Control-Flow
 * Juergen Giesl:
      Automated Termination Analysis for Haskell: From Term Rewriting to
      Programming Languages
The complete program is available at
