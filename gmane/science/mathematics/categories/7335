27TH ANNUAL ACM/IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (LICS 2012)

   Call for Participation
   June 25-28, 2012
   Dubrovnik, Croatia
   http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/lics/lics12/

* The LICS Symposium is an annual international forum on theoretical and
practical topics in computer science that relate to logic, broadly
construed.
LICS 2012 will be hosted by the University of Dubrovnik, in Dubrovnik,
Croatia, from June 25th to 28th, 2012.

* TUTORIALS

LICS 2012 will continue the tradition of pre-conference tutorials that was
initiated in 2011. This year, Jan Willem Klop will give a tutorial on term
rewriting systems and Andre Platzer will give a tutorial on logics of
dynamical systems.

* SPECIAL EVENTS AND INVITED LECTURES

There will be an invited lecture by Robert J. Aumann, winner of the 2005
Nobel
Prize in Economic Sciences, and a plenary session in honor of Alan Turing
on the
occasion of his centenary, with talks by Robert L. Constable, E. Allen
Emerson
(co-winner of 2008 A. M. Turing Award), Joan Feigenbaum, and Leonid Levin.

   Logic and Computational Complexity (LCC'12)
   Syntax and Semantics of Low-Level Languages (LOLA'12)

- June 29 (Friday)
   Algorithmics on Infinite-State Systems (AISS'12)
   Games for Logic and Programming Languages (GALOP'12)
   Intersection Types and Related Systems (ITRS'12)
   Logic and Systems Biology (LSB'12)
