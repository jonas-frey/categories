I don't know any name for the first question.  As for the second, I think
the conclusion is correct, but the reasoning is not.  The argument that
any automorphism of R is the identity does not depend on multiplicative
inverses.  But any automorphism of a transcendence basis will extend to a
homomorphism of R into C.  This takes place even in the category of
fields.

As a side comment (and the context in which I learned this), the German
translation of Pontrjagin's Topological Groups contains a chapter on
topological fields that was omitted in the English translation (unless it
has been added in the last 50 years).  In that chapter is a flawed
argument for the theorem that the only division algebras containing R are
R, C, and H.  The proof is flawed because the hypothesis did not assume,
but the proof used, that R is in the center of H.  C.T. Yang eventually
came up with the above argument and showed that whichever copy of R in C
you used, you got non-isomorphic quaternions!  Of course, all versions of
C are isomorphic since it is always the algebraic closure of R.  I might
add that, in the European style, "field" did not included commutativity.
So H was called a field.
