We actually had a post-seminar reference-hunt on this in Stockholm quite
recently, and found that the arrows-only definition goes right back to Mac
Lane 1948, =E2=80=9CGroups, Categories, and Duality=E2=80=9D:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1079106/pdf/pnas01707-0037.pdf

This cites two earlier papers only along with the definition (Mac Lane 1942
and Eilenberg=E2=80=93Mac Lane 1945 =E2=80=94 the first two papers to menti=
on categories,
right?), but both of those used the objects-and-arrows formulation.  So it
seems that the two-sorted formulation was considered right from the start,
and the arrows-only version either from the start or very soon afterwards.

Of course, the original question has already been well answered, but I
guess the extra history may be of interest to others as well.

Best,
=E2=80=93Peter.
