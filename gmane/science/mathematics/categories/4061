Concerning Ross Street's interesting remarks about history,
I should clarify where the term "Beck condition" comes from.

I would like to urge the readers of our categories
list to study Jon's 1967 thesis which is now available
via TAC Reprints. There one finds Jon's
tripleability theorems which were used for example by
Benabou and Roubaud in their 1970 paper on descent.

Ross remembers that Jon arrived in Tulane in 1969 prepared to
lecture on triples and descent. I heard Jon lecturing on that topic
already in late 1967 at a meeting of the American Mathematical
Society in Illinois. In particular, he explicitly stated the
condition that I therefore called the "Beck condition" in my
work on Hyperdoctrines (presented to an AMS meeting in NYC
in early 1968).

Later I saw this condition referred to as the Chevalley condition in a
paper of J-L Verdier. I do not know whether Jon was familiar
with that work of Chevalley.

Some sort of "coequalizer in the base implies descent" property on a
fibration F is of course true (in addition to F(X+Y) = F(X) x F(Y))
for those fibrations that exemplify a reasonable notion F of
parameterized family. Tripleability provides a useful
tool for analyzing these descents, but which are the tripleable (monadic)
functors that could arise from descent in some fibration?
