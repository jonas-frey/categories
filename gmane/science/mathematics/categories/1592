I can't answer Andrej's questions, but I can make a few

In base Golden Ratio with digits 0 and 1 (proposed by Pietro Di
Gianantonio), the family of identities that generates === is

   ... 100 ... === ... 011 ... 

It corresponds to the fact that the Golden Ratio is the positive
solution of the equation x^2 = x + 1.

    (i.e. 1 x^2 + 0 x^1 + 0 x^0 = 0 x^2 + 1 x^1 + 1 x^0)
          =       =       =       =       =       =

What I have reported about signed-digit binary notation has also been
developed for Golden-Ratio notation by David McGaw in his Honours
project ( http://www.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~mhe/macgaw.ps.gz ).  You may be
able to get a finite automaton from his algorithm for solving the word
problem. It should be even simpler than the one for signed binary,
because there are fewer cases to consider.

This is precisely what the Golden-Ratio notation achieves.

The interval I is now [0,phi], where phi is the Golden Ratio.

Then the "digit maps" are l(x)=(x+0)/phi and r(x)=(x+1)/phi.

The intersection of the images of l and r is a closed interval with
non-empty interior, as in your picture. 

The above family of identities is equivalent to the single equation
l o r o r = r o l o l.

One could try to consider algebras with two operations and this
equation in order to get the interval in a more constructive way.
