Some of you have asked: what is q-alg?

q-alg@eprints.math.duke.edu   is a fully automated electronic archive and
distribution server for papers on

        QUANTUM ALGEBRA AND TOPOLOGY (INCLUDING KNOT THEORY)
                    (starting from Dec, 1994)


This is an eprint archive for mathematics papers on ``quantum algebraic''
topics such as quantum groups (also known as noncommutative Hopf algebras) 
and related constructions, representations of affine Lie algebras, vertex 
operator algebras and operads, algebraic aspects of the KP and Toda lattice 
hierarchies, etc.

(JDS: although not listed explicitly, category theroy, especially
higher dim cats, is certainly appropriately posted to this server)

For the time being, the archive also welcomes submissions of mathematics
papers on modern knot theory (Jones and HOMFLY polynomials, Reshetikin-Turaev
invariants, etc.).  A separate archive will be formed for knot theory when the 
traffic becomes sufficient to warrant it.

Papers submitted to this archive should be intended for an audience of
mathematicians; we also welcome cross-listings of appropriate papers from
physics or other fields which are archived elsewhere.


Other mathematics archives running the same software:

 o  alg-geom@eprints.math.duke.edu    Algebraic Geometry
 o  auto-fms@msri.org                 Automorphic Forms
 o  cd-hg@msri.org                    Complex Dynamics and Hyperbolic Geometry
 o  dg-ga@msri.org                    Differential Geometry and Global Analysis
 o  q-alg@eprints.math.duke.edu       Quantum Algebra (including Knot Theory)

  In the generic xxx help text, substitute q-alg@eprints.math.duke.edu
      for the generic e-mail address arch-ive@xxx.lanl.gov
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outgoing mail from the e-print archive has the username no-reply
(to avoid problems due to occasional mail that bounces back).
Commands to the system should always be sent to arch-ive@xxx.lanl.gov
with the command in the subject field (e.g.  Subject: help).
Only one command at a time is accepted. Subscribers automatically
receive a listing of new titles/abstracts on days papers are received.

You will have a more pleasurable time using the archives if you read this
file carefully, read ALL responses you get to your interactions
with the archives, and follow the instructions therein.

This help file summarizes the email interface commands.

This information can be more easily accessed via the WorldWideWeb
at http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/ .
