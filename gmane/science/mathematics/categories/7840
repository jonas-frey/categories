Dear all,

We invite you to attend the inaugural research workshop of the Centre
for Quantum Mathematics and Computation at the University of Oxford,
on October 1-4, 2013.

The workshop will have plenary talks by Steve Awodey, John Baez,
Alexander Beilinson, Lucien Hardy, Martin Hyland, Dana Scott, Vladimir
Voevodsky, and Anton Zeilinger, along with contributed talks and a
problem session.

The workshop is one of four Clay Research Workshops occurring in
Oxford that week (including one on Number Theory and Physics, and one
on Computational Intractability) along with the Clay Research
Conference and the conference celebrating the opening of the new
Oxford Mathematics building.

The workshop page, including a link for registration, is at
http://www.claymath.org/workshops/QMAC/
where a schedule will soon be available.

Information about the Clay Research Conference and the other Clay
research workshops taking place at the same time is available at
http://www.claymath.org/CRC13/
and information about the new building conference is at
http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/new-building/opening

Information about the QMAC Centre can be found at the Centre homepage,
http://www.qmac.ox.ac.uk/

The workshop is funded by the Clay Mathematics Institute and the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

Some limited funding for travel and accommodation is available.
Inquiries regarding the workshop may be directed to
cdouglas@maths.ox.ac.uk.

Best wishes,
the organizing committee.
