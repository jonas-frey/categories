Dear Steve,

A bicomma object is a bicategorical limit, so determined only
up to equivalence. A comma object is a strict limit, so determined
up to isomorphism.=20

In the case of Cat, comma objects are just the usual comma categories
(strictly speaking, anything isomorphic to the comma category), while
anything equivalent to the comma category will be a bicomma object.

So any comma object is also a bicomma object, but the converse is false.
Moreover, there are 2-categories in which bicomma objects exist but
comma objects do not.

The situation with pullbacks, by the way, is slightly different. It is
not the case that every pullback is a bipullback (but there is a paper=20
of Joyal and Street giving a sufficient condition for a pullback to be
a bipullback).

Steve.

What is the difference between a bicomma object and a comma object
(a.k.a. lax pullback)?

Steve.
