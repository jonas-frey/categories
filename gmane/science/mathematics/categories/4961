I presume that Ross was using the word "topos" to mean "elementary topos".
But in any case, Eduardo was missing something: the proof that, if E is
an \infty-pretopos (my preferred name for what he calls a "Girau(d)
topos"), then every canonical sheaf on E is representable, requires the
existence of a generating set (see C2.2.7 in the Elephant). For a
counterexample in the absence of generators, let G be the "large" group
of all functions from the ordinals to {0,1} having finite support, the
group operation being pointwise addition mod 2 (or, if you prefer,
the group of finite subsets of the ordinals under symmetric difference),
and let E be the (elementary) topos of G-sets. For each ordinal \alpha,
let A_\alpha be the set {0,1} with G acting via its \alpha-th factor;
then any G-set admits morphisms into only a set of the A_\alpha, from
which it follows that the coproduct of all the A_\alpha exists as a
(set-valued) canonical sheaf on E, though it clearly isn't a set.
Moreover, this coproduct admits a proper class of maps to itself, so
the category of sheaves on E isn't locally small; hence it doesn't
violate Ross's conjecture.
