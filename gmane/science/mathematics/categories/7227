Applications are invited for PhD study under the supervision of Prof
Neil Ghani on any topic relating to higher dimensional category theory
and/or higher dimensional type theory. The position is fully funded for =
EU=20
students (apologies to non EU-citizens for this ridiculous piece of=20
non-meritocracy) and will last for 3 years.The applicant's motivation =
must centre  on a=20
desire for beautiful mathematics of lasting value. The applicant should =
also have an innate=20
sense of the wonder of learning allied to the capacity to work hard and =
achieve their=20
goals.

The Mathematically Structured Programming Group's vision is to use
mathematics to understand the nature of computation, and to then turn
that understanding into the next generation of programming
languages. This reflects the symbiotic relationship between
mathematics, programming, and the design of programming languages ---
any attempt to sever this connection will diminish each component. In
order to achieve these research goals we mainly use ideas from
category theory, type theory and functional programming. Besides
Professor Neil Ghani, the group consists of a number of
internationally leading researchers including Dr Patricia Johann, Dr
Conor McBride, Dr Peter Hancock, Dr Robert Atkey as well as a number
of PhD students.

Anyone interested should in the first instance contact Professor Neil
Ghani whose email address is "ng at cis.strath.ac.uk"  and outline their =
academic
background. Applications will be considered on a first come, first=20
served basis.=
