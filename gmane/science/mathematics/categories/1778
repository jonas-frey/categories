             Final Call for Papers
                   MFPS XVII

         Seventeenth Conference on the
          Mathematical Foundations of
             Programming Semantics

              Aarhus University
               Aarhus, Denmark
            May 24 - May 27, 2001

Partially Supported by BRICS and the US Office of Naval Research

The Seventeenth Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics will take place on the campus of Aarhus
University in Aarhus, Denmark from May 24 to May 27, 2001. The MFPS
conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic and
computer science which are related to the semantics of programming
languages. The series particularly has stressed providing a forum
where both mathematicians and computer scientists can meet and
exchange ideas about problems of common interest. We also encourage
participation by researchers in neighboring areas, since we strive to
maintain breadth in the scope of the series.

The invited speakers for MFPS 17 include:
          Olivier Danvy  (Aarhus)
          Neil Jones  (DIKU)
          Kim Larsen  (Aalborg)
          Prakash Panangaden  (McGill)
          Jan Rutten  (CWI)
          Glynn Winskel  (Cambridge)

In addition to the invited talks, there will be three special sessions.  =
The first will honor Neil Jones for his contributions to theoretical =
computer science; it is being organized by Olivier Danvy and David =
Schmidt (Kansas State).

The second will be a special session on model-checking, and it is being =
organized by Rance Cleaveland (Stony Brook) and Kim Larsen.=20

The final special session will be on security, and it is being organized =
by Catherine Meadows (NRL).

The remainder of the program will consist of papers selected from =
submissions we receive in response to this Call for Papers.

The Organizing Committee for MFPS consists of Stephen Brookes (CMU), =
Michael Main (Colorado), Austin Melton (Kent State University), Michael =
Mislove (Tulane) and David Schmidt (Kansas State).  The
Co-chairs for MFPS XVII are Olivier Danvy, Michael Mislove and David =
Schmidt.

The Program Committee Co-chairs for the meeting are Stephen Brookes and =
Michael Mislove. The Program Committee also includes:
   Lars Birkedal (ITU)
   Rance Cleaveland (Stony Brook)
   Marcelo Fiore (Sussex)
   Matthew Hennessy (Sussex)
   Alan Jeffrey (DePaul)
   Achim Jung (Birmingham)
   Gavin Lowe (Oxford)
   Catherine Meadows (NRL)
   Peter O'Hearn (Queen Mary and Westfield)
   Susan Older (Syracuse)
   Dusko Pavlovic (Kestrel Institute)
   Uday Reddy (Birmingham)
   Giuseppe Rosolini (Genoa)
   Davide Sangiorgi (Inria - Sophia Antipolis)
   Andre Scedrov (Penn)
Submissions must be extended abstracts of 12 pages or less. They should =
be in the form either of a PostScript file that can print on any =
PostScript printer, or a pdf file. In particular, submissions
should use the US letter size format, as opposed to the European A4 =
size.

Submissions can be sent by email to mfps@math.tulane.edu=20

The Deadline for Submissions is January 15, 2001

Information about decisions will be available by February 20, 2001, at =
which time a list of accepted papers will be posted.

As with MFPS XI, MFPS XIII and MFPS XV, the Proceedings of the =
conference will be published as a volume of the Electronic Notes in =
Theoretical Computer Science. For information about this series, access =
the URL http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs.

General inquiries about MFPS XVII can be addressed to =
mfps@math.tulane.edu.

In addition to supporting the conference overall, the support provided =
by the Office of Naval Research makes funds available to help offset =
expenses of graduate students. Women and minorities also are
encouraged to inquire about possible support to attend the meeting.

               Registration Information
Detailed information about registration and accommodations will be =
available on February 20, 2001, when the list of papers accepted for the =
meeting is posted.
