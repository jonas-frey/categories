A great question ... and  I do not have an answer for it.  However,  regard=
ing P (<) Q as a (posetal) module between the posets it does have the strik=
ing property that it is the final module!

Subject: categories: An elementary question

The category of posets (=3D partially ordered sets) and monotone
maps is often used as an easy example -- different from the category
of sets -- that has products, coproducts, and is cartesian closed
but not a topos.

Let P and Q be two posets.  Define (P (<) Q) as the modified
coproduct where all the elements of P are made less than all the
elements of Q.  QUESTION. Does (P (<) Q) have a nice categorical
definition as a functor in the category of posets?
