 	If schizophrenia, in a medical rather than etymological sense,
actually referred to split personality, there would be some point to the
term, and the debate would have some weight on both sides - especially
as the usage is not derogatory.  But as it's inaccurate, I think a more
descriptive replacement would be in order.
