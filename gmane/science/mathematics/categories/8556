Version 3.0 of the Java application Easik has been released. Previous
versions were announced on this list.

Easik is a graphical environment for database design based on the finite
limit, finite sum Entity-Attribute (EA) sketches, and also for data entry
and manipulation. EA sketches are the syntactic basis of the categorical
Sketch Data Model developed by the poster and Michael Johnson. The model
extends and considerably enhances the widely studied and implemented
Entity-Relationship-Attribute data model.

Easik supports graphical design of EA sketches and their export to SQL
database schemas. An exported schema has triggers and procedures which
enforce the graphically specified constraints, both finite limit and
finite sum. Views built from subschemas may be designed and implemented.
Easik also provides connectivity for data manipulation to the common
open-source database management system MySQL.

Version 3.0 contains the functionality of Version 2.0 and adds several new
view features. Most importantly, views can now implement constraints from
the supporting EA sketch. Some known safe view updates are permitted, and
are restricted in other cases. Constraint handling has been tested and
refined.

The application is available at
