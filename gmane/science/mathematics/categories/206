CALCO 2009 will be preceded by the CALCO Young Researchers Workshop,
CALCO-jnr, dedicated to presentations by PhD students and young
researchers at the beginning of their careers.

CALCO brings together researchers and practitioners to exchange new
results related to foundational aspects and both traditional and
emerging uses of algebras and coalgebras in computer science. The
study of algebra and coalgebra relates to the data, process and
structural aspects of software systems. This is a high-level,
bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of
CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer
Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development
Techniques). The first and second, very successful CALCO conferences
took place 2005 in Swansea, Wales, and 2007 in Bergen, Norway.

The third event will take place 2009 in Udine, Italy.

The CALCO Young Researchers Workshop, CALCO-jnr, is a CALCO satellite
workshop dedicated to presentations by PhD students and by those who have
completed their doctoral studies within the past few years.  Attendance at
the workshop is open to all - it is anticipated that many CALCO conference
participants will want to attend the CALCO-jnr workshop (and vice versa).

CALCO-jnr presentations will be selected according to originality,
significance, and general interest, on the basis of submitted 2-page
abstracts, by the CALCO-jnr PC. A booklet with the abstracts of the accepted
presentations will be available at the workshop.

After the workshop, the author(s) of each presentation will be invited
to submit a full 10-15 page paper on the same topic. They will also be
asked to write (anonymous) reviews of papers submitted by other authors
on related topics. Additional reviewing and the final selection of papers
will be carried out by the CALCO-jnr PC.

The volume of selected papers from the workshop will be published as a
technical report at Udine. Authors will retain copyright, and are also
encouraged to disseminate the results reported at CALCO-jnr by
subsequent publication elsewhere.


Topics of Interest
------------------
The CALCO Young Researchers Workshop will invite submissions on the same
topics as the CALCO conference: reporting results of theoretical work
on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the way these results
can support methods and techniques for software development, as well as
experience with the transition of resulting technologies into industrial
practice. In particular, the workshop will encourage submissions included
or related to the topics listed below.

* Abstract models and logics
 - Automata and languages,
 - Categorical semantics,
 - Modal logics,
 - Relational systems,
 - Graph transformation,
 - Term rewriting,
 - Adhesive categories

* Specialised models and calculi
 - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems,
 - Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed,
   mobile, and context-aware computing,
 - General systems theory and computational models
   (chemical, biological, etc)

* Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
 - Abstract data types,
 - Inductive and coinductive methods,
 - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation),
 - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques,
 - Semantics of programming languages

* System specification and verification
 - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification,
 - Formal testing and quality assurance,
 - Validation and verification,
 - Generative programming and model-driven development,
 - Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
   hardware/middleware/architectures,
 - Process algebra
