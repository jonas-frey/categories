And it isn't just "infinite" and "infinitesimal" numbers like \omega and
1/\omega that come along for the ride, either.  Classically, the copy of
the natural numbers sitting inside the surreal numbers is actually the
*finite ordinal numbers*, and constructively there are many more ordinal
numbers below \omega than there are natural numbers.  For instance,

{ 0 | P }

where P is an undecidable statement, is a perfectly good ordinal
number that lies "somewhere between 0 and 1."
