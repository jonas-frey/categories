Dear all,

Here is a canonical, but perhaps not trivial, way of constructing an
algebra for any finitary algebraic theory.  Does anyone know anything
about it?  E.g. is there existing work on it, or an alternative
description?

Take a finitary monad (T, eta, mu) on Set.  We construct an algebra A
for the monad in three steps:

(i) Let C be the terminal coalgebra for the endofunctor T (which exists
since T is finitary).

(ii) Regard C as an algebra for the endofunctor T (via Lambek's Lemma:
the structure map of C is invertible).

(iii) Turn C into an algebra A for the monad (T, eta, mu) by applying
the left adjoint to the inclusion

    (T, eta, mu)-Alg ----> T-Alg.


Here are two examples.

1. Fix a monoid M and let (T, eta, mu) be the theory of left M-sets.
Then C is the set of infinite sequences (m_1, m_2, ...) of elements of
M, and A = C/~ where ~ is generated by

    (m_1, m_2, ...) ~ (m_1 ... m_n, m_{n+1}, m_{n+2}, ...)

for any natural number n and m_i in M.

2. Let (T, eta, mu) be the theory of monoids.  Then C is the set of
infinite planar trees in which each vertex may have any natural number
of branches ascending from it (or descending, according to convention).
Next, A = C/~ where ~ is generated by

    s o (t_1, ..., t_n) ~ s' o (t_1, ..., t_n)

for any finite n-leafed trees s, s' and t_1, ..., t_n in C.  Here "o"
means "grafting": the left-hand side is the union of s and the (t_i)s,
with the root of t_i glued to the i-th leaf of s.

Hence A is the set of equivalence classes of infinite trees, where two
trees are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by altering
just a finite portion at its base.

This equivalence relation (or actually, the analogous one for
commutative monoids) is what made me start thinking about all this.

Thanks,
Tom
