Dear colleagues,


would you please forward this e-mail to the students of yours that may be
interested by these 3-year PhD positions, proposed at Onera (the
French Aerospace Research Center) in Toulouse. Fluency in French *or* in
English is mandatory.

This subjects are part of a research agenda aiming at helping define and
verify large and complex (non-software) systems by using categorical methods
as already used in computer science.

Best regards,

dc

Subject:  The development  of  space systems  (including on-board  and
ground systems)  requires complex engineering and  relies upon various
disciplines. Until now,  the success of such projects  has relied upon
the quality and experience of engineers as well as on partly-automated
development  processes.  However,  although  some technical  artifacts
(e.g: mathematical  model of a battery, satellite  simulator) are used
in such  developments, there  is still =E2=80=94and  mainly=E2=80=94 a huge=
  amount of
paper documentation expressed in natural language. This complexity and
diversity of technical means mitigate  the validation of a whole space
system.    Systems  model-based   development,  inspired   by  similar
approaches in the software field,  is gaining more and more importance
both  in  the  industrial  and  academic  communities.   However,  the
mainstream  solutions  currently  proposed are  still  unsatisfactory,
notably on  two major points: =E2=80=93  on one hand,  the requirement capt=
ure
phase and  its further refinement  towards a formal  specification are
not well  taken into account;  =E2=80=93 on the  other hand, there is  stil=
l a
lack of formal semantics  for architectural models.  Both these points
have obviously a  strong impact on the verification  and validation of
such  systems.  The  objective  of  this PhD  is  to propose  relevant
concepts  for a  modeling  language addressing  these questions.   The
solution to  the first problem  may rely on  goal-oriented requirement
engineering, in  the style  of KAOS or  Tropos methods...   The second
question will  be addressed by devising  formal architectural concepts
with  further  (semi-)automated  verification  in  mind.   Categorical
and/or   algebraic   approaches,   process   calculi,   model-oriented
techniques  (such as  the B  method)  will be  favoured. Results  from
software  engineering,  such as  component-based  development will  be
taken into account. The results of the PhD will be backed up by a case
study and may be implemented in a software prototype.

Candidate  profile:  MSc in  computer  science,  having followed  some
=E2=80=9Ctheory=E2=80=9D  courses (e.g logic,  =CE=BB-calculus, process  al=
gebra, algebraic
specification, B or Z method, etc.). Fluency in English.

Gross  salary:   ranging  1680-2140   EUR  /month  depending   on  the
profile. 3-year position.

Localisation:   Onera  is  the   French  Aerospace   Research  Center,
affiliated to the French Ministry  of Defence. The PhD will be carried
out at Toulouse  premises. Located in southwest France,  Toulouse is a
lively city, the 4th most important town in France, and the 2nd one as
far    as     the    student    population     is    concerned    (see

							A FORMAL SETTING FOR VIEWPOINT COMPOSITION

Subject: A  current approach to  the engineering of  systems (software
systems, sociotechnical systems, systems of systems, etc.) consists in
modeling them,  during specification  and design phases,  according to
various  viewpoints. This  approach aims  at helping  engineers handle
extremely complex systems by  providing them with a view corresponding
to their  sole business (e.g  air or space  regulation, dependability,
realtime  performance,  etc.),  abstracting  from other  concerns.  Of
course,  the viewpoints  that  are  useful may  strongly  vary on  the
context,  henceforth   entailing  the  recurring   definition  of  new
multi-view  modeling languages.   This definition  is  usually ad-hoc,
which forces language designers  either to ignore semantic matters and
remain on  a purely syntactic definition,  or to propose  a new formal
semantics  and  demonstrate a  certain  number  of otherwise  standard
results.  The aim  of this PhD is to propose  a theoretical setting to
assist  in  the  creation  of  multi-view  languages  out  of  =E2=80=9Csma=
ll=E2=80=9D
predefined modeling languages (each  one being concerned with only one
topic). The major question is then to determine under which conditions
it  is possible  to  deduce  the formal  semantics  of the  multi-view
language from the semantics  of its constituent languages. Another way
to  state this problem  is to  say that  we aim  at provding  a formal
semantics to  aspect-oriented metamodeling.  The  foreseen theoretical
solutions essentially rely on categorical approaches: algebraic speci-
fication, theory of institutions,  graph grammars, etc. The results of
the PhD will be backed up by  a case study and may be implemented in a
software prototype.

Candidate  profile:  MSc  in  computer  science or  in  logic,  having
