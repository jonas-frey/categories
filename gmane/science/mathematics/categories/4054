9th International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science
                http://www.cwi.nl/projects/cmcs08/
                         Budapest, Hungary
                          April 4-6, 2008

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 11th European Joint
     Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software ETAPS 2008
                        March 29 - April 6, 2008

Aims and Scope

During the last few years, it has become increasingly clear that a
great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition
systems, automata, process calculi and class-based systems, can be
captured uniformly as coalgebras.  Coalgebra is developing into a
field of its own interest presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a
growing field of applications and interactions with various other
fields such as reactive and interactive system theory, object oriented
and concurrent programming, formal system specification, modal logic,
dynamical systems, control systems, category theory, algebra,
and analysis. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its
applications.



The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

      the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and
          categorical approaches);
      coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for
          programming languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
      coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
      coalgebras and data types;
      coinductive definition and proof principles for coalgebras
          (with bisimulations or invariants);
      probabilistic systems as coalgebras;
      algebras versus coalgebras;
      coalgebraic specification and verification;
      coalgebras and (modal) logic;
      game theory in coalgebra;
      coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and
           hybrid systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, Genova, Grenoble, Warsaw, Barcelona and Vienna. The
proceedings appeared as Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer
Science (ENTCS) Volumes 11,19, 33, 41, 65.1, 82.1, 106 and 164.1.
You can get an idea of the types of papers presented at the meeting
by looking at the tables of contents of the ENTCS volumes
from those workshops.


Location

CMCS 2008 will be held in Budapest on April 4-6, 2008. It will be a
satellite workshop of ETAPS 2008, the European Joint Conferences on
Theory and Practice of Software.


Programme Committee

Jiri Adamek (chair, Braunschweig),
Corina Cirstea (Southampton),
Neil Ghani (Nottingham),
H. Peter Gumm (Marburg),
Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen),
Clemens Kupke (co-chair, Amsterdam),
Alexander Kurz (Leicester),

Larry Moss (Indiana),
John Power (Edinburgh),
Jan Rutten (Amsterdam),
Lutz Schroder  (Bremen),
Tarmo Uustalu (Tallinn),

Hiroshi Watanabe (Osaka).


Submissions

Two sorts of submissions will be possible this year:

Papers to be evaluated by the programme committee for inclusion in the
ENTCS proceedings:

These papers must be written using ENTCS style files and be of length
no greater than 20 pages. They must contain original contributions, be
clearly written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison
with related work. If a submission describes software, software tools,
or their use, it should include all source code that is needed to
reproduce the results but is not publicly available. If the additional
material exceeds 5 MB, URL's of publicly available sites should be
provided in the paper.

Short contributions:

These will not be published but will be compiled into a technical
report of the Technical University of Braunschweig. They should be
no more than two pages and may describe work in progress, summarise
work submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere, or in some
other way appeal to the CMCS audience.

Both sorts of submission should be submitted in postscript or pdf form
as attachments to an email to cmcs08@cwi.nl.  The email should
include the title, corresponding author, and, for the first kind of
submission, a text-only one-page abstract.

After the workshop, we expect to produce a journal proceedings of
extended versions of selected papers to appear in Theoretical
Computer Science.


Important Dates

 Deadline for submission of regular papers:     January 13, 2008.
 Notification of acceptance of regular papers:  February 11, 2008.
 Final version for the preliminary proceedings: February 18, 2008.

 Deadline for submission of short contributions:      March 10, 2008.
 Notification of acceptance of short contributions:   March 17, 2008.
