  Fixed Points in Computer Science
             FICS'03
  A Satellite Workshop to ETAPS'2003
  12-13 April, 2003, Warsaw, Poland


           CALL FOR PAPERS



Aim. Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer
science and logic by justifying induction and recursive definitions.
The construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated
in many different frameworks such as: design and implementation of
programming languages, program logics, databases. The aim of the
workshop is to provide a forum for researchers to present their
results to those members of the computer science and logic communities
who study or apply the theory of fixed points.  Previous workshops
where held in Brno (1998, MFCS workshop), Paris (2000, LC2000
workshop), Florence (2001, PLI workshop). Copenhagen (2002, LICS
workshop).

Topics include, but are not restricted to: Construction and reasoning
about properties of fixed points, categorical, metric and ordered
fixed point models, continuous algebras, relation algebras, regular
algebras of finitary and infinitary languages, formal power series,
word and tree automata, the mu-calculus and other programming logics,
fixed points in process algebras and process calculi, fixed points and
the lambda calculus, fixed points in relation to dataflow and
circuits, fixed points in logic programming, databases and complexity
theory.
