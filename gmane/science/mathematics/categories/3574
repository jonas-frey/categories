           Announcement and Call for Abstracts

                      Joint Workshop

                       Domains VIII
                           and
          Computability  Over Continuous Data Types

              Novosibirsk, September 11 -- 15, 2007


 The Workshop 'Domains' series is aimed at computer scientists and
 mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
 foundations of computation. It focusses on domain theory, its  
 applications
 and related topics. It will be combined with topics based on the
 German--Russian project 'Computability Over Non-discrete Structures:
 Models, Semantics, Complexity' supported by Russian Foundation for
 Basic Research (RFBR) and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

 SCOPE
 Topics for this workshop include, but are not limited to

     domains and topology for semantics
     effective domains and spaces
     computation over continuous spaces
     program semantics
     models of sequential computation
     lambda calculus
     realizability
     proof mining
     constructive mathematics and its semantics
     computability theory
     computable models
     admissible sets

 LOCATION
  The Workshop will take place at the Sobolev Instituts of Mathematics
  of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences
  located in Akademgorodok, which is formally a district of  
 Novosibirsk.

 PARTICIPATION
 If you would like to participate in this workshop, please
 let us know your interest at an early stage. Please indicate whether
 you intend to give a talk:

          domains@math.nsc.ru

 SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS
 One page abstracts should be submitted to

          domains@math.nsc.ru

 Shortly after an abstract is submitted (usually a few weeks),
 the authors will be notified by the programme committee. Abstracts
 will be dealt with on a first come/first served basis. Submit as soon
 as possible.
 DEADLINE   15 May 2007\\[2mm]

 INVITED SPEAKERS
 will be announced later on.

 according to the usual requirements of the Journal.

 ACCOMODATION
 All participants will be accommodated in the Hotel ``Zolotaya Dolina''
 (Gold Valley) situated at walking distance from the Instituts of
 Mathematics.

 FEES
 There will be a registration fee of 85 Euros for covering
 expenses.  For participants from Eastern Europa and the former  
 Soviet Union
 we set the fee 300 Russian Roubles. PhD students do not pay a fee. If
 the fee is a problem, please contact the organizers for a possible
 arrangement in advance.

 VISAS AND REGISTRATION
 Most foreign participants will need a visa to enter Russia.
 We will inform you later about details. You also can find details at
