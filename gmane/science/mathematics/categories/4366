Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Semantics of Computation

The Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science at the School of
Informatics, University of Edinburgh invites applications for a
postdoctoral research associate, tenable for up to three years, on the
EPSRC-funded project "Linear Observations and Computational Effects"
(EPSRC research grant EP/F042043/1).

The project involves the development of category-theoretic models of
computation and associated type theories, and the application of these
to establishing behavioural properties of programming constructs. The
successful applicant will hold a PhD in a relevant area of theoretic
computer science or mathematics and will have a good knowledge of
category theory and/or type theory and their computer science
applications. The post will be taken up as soon as possible.

Fixed Term: Up to 3 years

Closing date: 30th April 2008
