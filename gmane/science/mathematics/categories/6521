Hi!


Your permutability axiom for different compositions is reminiscent of the=
  interchange law, so I wonder if the structures you mean are the n-fold c=
ategories introduced by Charles Ehresmann in "Cat=C3=A9gories structur=C3=
=A9es" cf.

http://www.numdam.org/item?id=3DASENS_1963_3_80_4_349_0

which is possibly the first article on higher-order category theory.


An n-fold category C is just a class C equipped with n composition struct=
ures (giving composition operations *_0, ..., *_{n-1} on C) that for all =
i,j<n satisfy the interchange law

(f *_i g) *_j (u *_i v) =3D (f *_j u) *_i (g *_j v)

whenever f,g,u,v in C are such that both sides are defined. The notion of=
  composition structure for a class C coincides with the so-called "arrows=
  only" definition of a category. It consists of a source operation s:C->C=
, a target operation t:C->C, and a composition operation

*: (C x_{s,t} C) -> C

where (C x_{s,t} C) is the collection of consecutive arrows with respect =
to the source and target operations (i.e. the vertex of the pullback of s=
  and t), such that for all f,u,g in C

1. s( s(f) ) =3D s(f) =3D t( s(f) )  and  s( t(f) ) =3D t(f) =3D t( t(f) =
)
2. (f * u) * g =3D f * (u * g)  whenever both sides are defined
3. s(f) * f =3D f =3D f * t(f)

The 1st condition says that a fixed point of s is also fixed point of t a=
nd vice-versa, and that the range of these operations contains only their=
  shared fixed points: the objects of the category. The 2nd condition stat=
es that * is associative, and the 3rd that the source and target of an ar=
row f are respectively left and right units for composition with f (so th=
e objects are used as identity arrows). From these axioms it follows that

s(f * u) =3D s(f)  and t(f * u) =3D t(u)

as usual. (Note that f*u means "first do f then u" as is common in semigr=
oup theory.) It has already been pointed out that an Eckmann-Hilton argum=
ent shows that under the interchange axiom two composition structures i a=
nd j will coincide whenever s_i =3D s_j and t_i =3D t_j.


Each entity f in an n-fold category C is an arrow in n different ways. Th=
is may be written

f :_{n-1}  s_{n-1}(f) -> t_{n-1)(f)
   ...
   :_{0}    s_{0}(f)   -> t_{0}(f)

These are distinct from the cells of (strict) n-categories. The latter no=
tion is often defined inductively using enrichment, but its single-sorted=
  (or arrows only) counterpart is precisely an n-fold category such that f=
or all f in C

s_i( s_j(f) ) =3D s_i(f) =3D s_i( t_j(f) )  and  t_i( s_j(f) ) =3D t_i(f)=
  =3D t_i( t_j(f) )

whenever i<j<n. These conditions ensure that objects of the structure i w=
ill also be objects of the structure i+1, etc. In this case the source an=
d target operations make C a globular set.


The theory of n-fold categories was further developed by Ehresmann et al.=
  in a series of articles called "Multiple Functors". These were written i=
n English and are also available at http://www.numdam.org/


Hope this information is useful.
