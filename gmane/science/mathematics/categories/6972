This is about two points of a recent message of Dmitry Roytenberg,
forwarded by Urs Schreiber.

I do not know of any such description. But there is a nice abstract
description of the site of
cubical sets with connections, parallel to a well-known
characterisation of the simplicial site:

    - the free strict monoidal category with an assigned dioid.
    See [GM], Thm. 5.2. (There are analogous results for the other
cubical sites.)

A `dioid' is a set with two monoid operations, where the unit of each
operation is
absorbant for the other. Typically, an abstract interval has such a
structure, and a cylinder
functor has the structure of a 'diad'. See [Gr].
(I was also using the terms 'cubical monoid' and 'cubical monad', for
an obvious analogy;
later I abandoned them because they could be misleading - obviously
again).

Every lattice is an idempotent dioid, but idempotency is - apparently
- of no
interest in homotopy. This leads us to the second point: smooth
homotopy.

For smooth homotopy one should use a different (non-idempotent) dioid,
still commutative and involutive:

NOT the standard interval with min, max, linked by the involution  t'
= 1 - t,

BUT the standard interval with multiplication and *, linked
by the same involution:
    x*y = (x'.y')' = x + y - xy.

See [Gr].
