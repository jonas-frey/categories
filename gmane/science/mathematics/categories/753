``On branched covers in topos theory''

Abstract: We present some new findings conerning branched covers in 
topos theory. Our discussion involves a particular subtopos of a 
given topos that can be described as the smallest subtopos closed 
under small coproducts in the including topos.  We also have some new 
results concerning the general theory of KZ-doctrines, such as the 
the closure under composition of discrete fibrations for a KZ-
doctrine (in the sense of Bunge/Funk, ``On a bicomma object condition 
for KZ-doctrines'').

Regards,
Jonathon Funk
