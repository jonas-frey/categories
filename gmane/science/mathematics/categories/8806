The 2016 Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and
Computation

Call for Nominations


Introduction

An annual award, called the Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding
Contributions to Logic and Computation, was established in 2015 by the
ACM Special Interest Group for Logic and Computation (SIGLOG), the
European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), the
European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL), and the Kurt
G??del Society (KGS). The award is for an outstanding contribution
represented by a paper or by a small group of papers published within
the past 25 years. This time span allows the lasting impact and depth of
the contribution to have been established. The award can be given to an
individual, or to a group of individuals who have collaborated on the
research. For the rules governing this award, see
http://siglog.hosting.acm.org/the-alonzo-church-award-for-outstanding-contributions-to-logic-and-computation/


Eligibility and Nominations

The contribution must have appeared in a paper or papers published
within the past 25 years. Thus, for the 2016 award, the cut-off date is
January 1, 1991. When a paper has appeared in a conference and then in a
journal, the date of the journal publication will determine the cut-off
date. In addition, the contribution must not yet have received
recognition via a major award, such as the Turing Award, the Kanellakis
Award, or the G??del Prize. (The nominee(s) may have received such awards
for other contributions.) While the contribution can consist of
conference or journal papers, journal papers will be given a preference.

Nominations for the 2016 award are now being solicited. The nominating
letter must summarize the contribution and make the case that it is
fundamental and outstanding. The nominating letter can have multiple
co-signers. Self-nominations are excluded. Nominations must include: a
proposed citation (up to 25 words); a succinct (100-250 words)
description of the contribution; and a detailed statement (not exceeding
four pages) to justify the nomination. Nominations may also be
accompanied by supporting letters and other evidence of worthiness.

Nominations are due by March 1, 2016, and should be submitted to
vardi@cs.rice.edu.


Presentation of the Award

The 2016 award will be presented at LICS, the flagship conference of
SIGLOG. The award will be accompanied by an invited lecture by the award
winner, or by one of the award winners. The awardee(s) will receive a
certificate and a cash prize of USD 2,000. If there are multiple
awardees, this amount will be shared.


Award Committee

The 2016 Alonzo Church Award Committee consists of the following four
members: Catuscia Palamidessi, Gordon Plotkin, Wolfgang Thomas, and
Moshe Vardi (chair).
