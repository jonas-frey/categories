It's also not true that George Cantor committed suicide!

And I would not call Ludwig Boltzmann a mathematician.  I'd call him a
physicist.

But the documentary seems a bit more accurate than this summary.
And it could be good to have documentaries that sensationalize mathematics
and make it seem "edgy" and "dangerous".  We oldsters can tut-tut about the
inaccuracies and lack of serious content, but as a kid I would have enjoyed
it - and if it makes one youngster pursue a career in mathematics instead o=

crime, that may justify its existence.
