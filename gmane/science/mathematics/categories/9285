Hi Steve,

Ah, excellent. I do wonder then, if free parameterised list objects
are finitary (parameterised) W-types and all of the latter exist when
the former exist (in the presence of the other assumptions on the AU),
if existence of W-types is a cleaner assumption for an AU. It may be
like the definition of elementary topos, where terminal object,
pullbacks and power objects suffice, but people sometimes just package
(local) cartesian closedness into the definition (not to speak of
finite colimits) as it is perfectly equivalent.

From a categorical point of view W-types may be ok, though for certain
parsimonious presentations I guess list objects may be smaller to
describe and so desirable for that reason.

To advertise slightly some of my own work that I presented at Topos =C3=A0
l'IH=C3=89S (or at least some approximation of the following), the
following construction gives an arithmetic pretopos (with finitary
W-types), plus some.

Take a filtered category R that is (classically) well-founded with
terminal object, R may be large. Let E:R^op --> Topos/Set be a diagram
in Grothendieck toposes. Define E*: R --> (Topos/Set)^op --> Set/LEX
where the latter functor sends a topos to the underlying
infinitary-lextensive category and a geometric morphism to its left
exact cocontinuous inverse image functor. I allow for objects of LEX
to be large categories. Then colim E* is an infinitary Heyting
pretopos with subobject classifier and parameterised finitary W-types.
If R is small, this is the limit of the diagram of toposes, but if R
is large then this colimit arises in set theory as "(Easton) class
forcing".

If one starts instead with a base other than set, and even not with
toposes but the underlying pretopos then I imagine one still have a
reasonable structure at the end, minus perhaps the infinitary colimits
and the subobject classifier. One of the points I wasn't sure on is
the classical well-foundedness; I'm not 100% sure I conjecture than
for any "pretame" class forcing (a partial order with top and with
some local smallness conditions) then one has a similar result,
constructing an Easton pretopos. There are conditions one can give
that ensure one has a topos at the end. The pretameness could be
generalised to other sites than partial orders with double negation.

David
