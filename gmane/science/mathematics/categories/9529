People tend not to notice  the Stone space aspects in the usual examples
based on
real analysis, since  they are also locally connected. Being a Stone space
then just
makes the set of connected components finite with decidable equality. For
any compact
regular space, we find that each closed subspace has a Stone space of
connected components.

Digressing a bit, this reminds me of some results David Roberts recently
pointed out.
However, they concern path-connected components rather than connected
components.
The set of path-connected components of a space X is a quotient set of X,
so we can give
it the quotient topology.   What can the resulting space be like?

Anything!     For every topological space X, there is a paracompact
Hausdorff space
whose space of path-connected components is homeomorphic to X.
