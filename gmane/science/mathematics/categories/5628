[ Note from moderator: As the poster rightly suggests, time to move
further discussion off of list; this is the last of this thread. BTW, I
can confirm from a first use this morning that jarnal works smoothly as
advertised - shared page collaboration is easy and no external server
required; thanks to Andrew for the tip. ]

One of the things about jarnal is that "setting up a server" is trivial. =
 It
does it all for you.

I should confess that I have never actually used jarnal for this, though =
I use
it all the time for my lectures (being able to write on the computer save=
s
a lot of time).  If anyone likes the sound of giving it a go and would li=
ke to
see what it's like, I'd be happy to try it out.  Probably best to arrange=
 this
off-list if anyone's interested.
