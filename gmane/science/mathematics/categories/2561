Hi Jim--

The bound thesis did reach him, and he was very happy to have it.  It came
to my house, actually, and we got it to him.  I probably forgot to write you
and tell you so -- sorry about that.   It's really nice for him to still reap
rewards from that part of his life, as he seems to have aged prematurely.

Thanks so much for making it happen.

--Nadine
