Dear Dmitry,

Absolutely correct (although it does not change anything I said).

Thank you for explaining "why". So your real question is about preservation
of finite limits by functors of the form A+(-), in the case non-commutative
algebras (of various kinds). Well, from this point of view the categories of
algebras are 'difficult', and I don't recall any reasonable result at the
moment. Moreover, I am surprised that Barr's theorem helps here (which does
not mean that the theorem itself is not good of course!), and I would be
very interested to learn, what exactly could you deduce from it?

Best regards,

George
