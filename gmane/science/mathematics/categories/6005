Here's a slightly artificial counterexample: let C be the category
of finite sets whose cardinality is a power of 2, and all functions
between them. The covariant power-set functor restricts to a
functor C --> C, and has a monad structure whose algebras are
semilattices. If the tensor product of this monad with itself
existed, its algebras would be bisemilattices, i.e. sets with two
semilattice structures which "commute with each other" in the
obvious sense. Free bisemilattices exist, but they don't
necessarily have cardinality a power of 2: by my calculation, the
free bisemilattice on two generators has seven elements. So the
free-bisemilattice functor doesn't exist as an endofunctor of C.
