[Note from moderator:  To reiterate: expressions of interest in the backup
TeX editor position for TAC should be sent directly to Michael Barr,
<barr@math.mcgill.ca>, and not to this mailing list. Thanks for those
already sent. The TAC request that authors submit a single source file has
nothing to do with archiving. Its purpose is to simplify slightly the
editors' work.]

Dear Mike,

In response to your request for volunteers to take over the
TeXnical management of TAC,  I would certainly consider taking
part in a committee to undertake this.

I believe that I am qualified for the job.  TeX has an error message,
"Interwoven alignment preambles are not allowed", about which the
TeXbook (p299) says, "If you have been so devious as to get this
message, you will know what it means, and you will deserve no
sympathy".  I got it in about 1992, developing my diagrams package,
and take it as my qualification to be a "TeXpert".

There is, however, a condition, namely that TAC's use of LaTeX be
brought up to date.   In particular, macros should be separated
in a modular fashion from mathematics.  You insist on their being
pasted in-line for the dubious reason of trying to archive papers
as single files, whereas anybody else would use a directory (folder).

Since I am making this offer in public, I would like to take the
opportunity to point out to users of my diagrams package that
version 3.91 has expired, and they should get a new one from
	www.PaulTaylor.EU/diagrams
Also, even in V 3.91, the option "noPostScript" has been renamed
"UglyObsolete", as a further attempt to get people to stop using
the pre-1992 code that uses LaTeX-style diagonal lines.

Best wishes,
Paul Taylor
