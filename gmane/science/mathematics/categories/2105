Similar thoughts had occurred to me. Brouwer's theorem is clearly
not constructive, since it doesn't hold (even locally) continuously in
parameters (consider a path in the space of endomaps of [0,1]
passing through the identity, where the fixed point `flips' from
one end of the interval to the other as it does so). However, Browder's
result would seem to suggest that the `locale of fixed points of f'
(that is, the equalizer of f and the identity in the category of
locales) might be consistent (that is, `inhabited') in general,
even though it may not have any points. It's certainly conceivable
that that might be true constructively, though I can't see how to
prove it -- but it isn't the full content of Browder's theorem.
