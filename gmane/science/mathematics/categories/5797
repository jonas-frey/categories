Yes, I think "rigid" is traditional in algebraic geometry.  Perhaps some
wiser head could explain how it originated!

Personally I often use "compact', since "compact closed" seems redudant.
And if I were king of the world, I'd use "with duals for objects".

Regarding the relation of this use of "compact" to the use in topology:

The only relationship I can think of is that a

I don't know if this is what people were thinking when they first applied
"compact" to categories, or just my own rationalization, but:

A compact subset is closed, but it has a very nice property: its image under
any continuous map is again closed.  Similarly a compact category is a
closed, but it has a very nice property: its essential image under any
symmetric monoidal functor is again compact.

I don't claim this justifies the terminology, but it helped me learn to live
with it.
