Speaking as one who hated mathematics consistently in school, and then  =

came to be deeply intrigued by category theory (because I have a  =

probably-pathological obsession with corollaries), I am forced to concur=
   =

with Tom. I=E2=80=99ll never be a professional mathematician, but someth=
ing about  =

basic category theory just sounds so human. Analogies, homologies,  =

similarities, memories =E2=80=A6 these are the things our minds process =
every time  =

we look at a face, and category theory says =E2=80=9CI can help you draw=
  a bunch  =

of squiggly stuff for that.=E2=80=9D What=E2=80=99s not to love?
