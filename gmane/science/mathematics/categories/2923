Perhaps it has not been sufficiently emphasized that semi-categories and
the like are not really "generalizations" of categories (though formally
they may appear so). Actually they present possibly-useful SPECIAL classes
of categories. That is because we represent one ultimately in an actual
large category (such as sets or abelian groups) and those representations
are indeed representations of a certain ordinary (V-) category, namely the
one freely generated by the given semicategory. The forgetful 2-functor
has a left adjoint, just as does the one from categories to directed
graphs etc. To be a value of such a left adjoint means that the large
category of representations may have special properties, for example it
may unite by a bicontinuous quotient p a pair of subcategories i, j whose
domains are identical but where i, j are themselves opposite in that they
are the respective adjoints to the same p. This is the kind of UIAO that
Francis refers to.

Is there a convincing example showing that it can be useful mathematically
to treat operator ideals (such as compact, nuclear, etc) as
semicategories?

I always believed that Jacobson invented rngs because algebraic practice
(not the dreaded categorists) had convinced him to grudgingly conclude
that after all ideals in rings are ideals but not subrings, whereas the
opposite view is not a convenience but a confusion which denies ideals
their dignity.
