Apologies for the previous trivial question.  Here is the correct version=
.

(The mistake was omitting to say that the subcategory must contain all
endomorphisms of M.)

*

My colleague Walter Mazorchuk has the following question.

Being abelian is a *property* of a category, not extra structure.  Given
an abelian category A, it therefore makes sense to define a subcategory o=
f
A to be an ABELIAN SUBCATEGORY if, considered as a category in its own
right, it is abelian.  Note that a priori, the inclusion need not preserv=
e
sums, kernels etc.

Now let R be a ring and M an R-module.  Is there a minimal abelian
subcategory of Mod-R containing M and all its endomorphisms?  If so, is
there a canonical way to describe it?

Any thoughts or pointers to the literature would be welcome.  Feel free t=
o
assume hypotheses on R (it might be a finite-dimensional algebra etc), or
to answer the question for full subcategories only.

Thanks,
Tom
