Dear All,

Some of you may have been pinged already, but I wanted to call attention =
to a pair of papers I have posted to the arXiv at the end of last week:=20=


https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02816 [1]
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02885 [2]

The article [1] may be of interest to those interested in categorical =
logic. It describes a generalization of the Curry-Howard correspondence =
to a generalized setting, resembling a higher category. The second =
article [2] is connected in the sense that [1] motivates [2], and =
conversely [2] provides background that may be needed to read [1], but I =
am right on top of the project so it is hard for me to say.=20

I would estimate this work is somewhere between "fresh" and "very =
fresh". So I would welcome your comments and critiques, and reports of =
any nits or sources of discomfort.=20

Best to All Here,
Lucius Schoenbaum
