I do no see the diference between

"on some aspects ..." and "on certain aspects ..."

On the other hand, Grothendieck writes the "on". I disagree with Colin about
"Some aspects ...", a translator is not an interpreter, and if there was an
"on", he should leave it !!

the reader wants to read Grothendieck, not what the translator thinks he
should have written, or what his view of the paper may have been

I imagine I will distrust any translation made by Colin, sorry Colin

of course, in footnotes the translator can insert any comment he wants.
