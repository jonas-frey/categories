The final schedule for Octoberfest '05 is now available, and
can be found on the website:

http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~scpsg/Octoberfest05/Octoberfest.final1.htm

As you can see, we have a busy schedule. Rather than having a
banquet, we will provide lunch on both Saturday and Sunday.
Ottawa has many fine restaurants for dinner, and a dining guide
will be provided.

As is traditional for Octoberfest, we have managed to keep costs to
a minimum. Registration will be 25 dollars, and students may attend
for free.

We remind you that if you need parking for the weekend, you must
contact us right away.

Look forward to seeing you all soon,
Rick Blute
Phil Scott
