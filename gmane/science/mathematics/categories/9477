Dear category theorists,

We are pleased to announce that the 103rd Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves
and Logic will be held on the weekend of 7/8 April 2018 in Brno, Czech
Republic. On April 6 there will be an introductory "pre-PSSL" afternoon
hosting talks by Moritz Groth and Simon Henry, on the theme of higher
category theory.

The seminar welcomes talks on topics related to any flavour of category
theory and its applications, and it is in particular dedicated to PhD
students and young researches.

Please let us know if you would like to participate and give a talk by
providing an abstract on the website of the conference (if the
registration form tells you an error occurred, please email us at
pssl103brno@gmail.com):

Brno is easily accessible from the UK with direct flights from London
Stansted, and is also near to Vienna, Bratislava and Prague. Regular
train connections depart from Prague and Vienna.

Further information about travel and accommodation will appear on the
conference website, and we will send a second announcement soon with
further details.

We hope to see you in Brno!
