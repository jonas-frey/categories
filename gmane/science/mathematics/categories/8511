Several positions are available, in projects ranging from automated
static and dynamic analysis of libraries and frameworks for web
applications; theories and tools for language-based security; theories
and tools for modular reasoning about higher-order concurrent
imperative programs; and type theory and interactive proof assistants.

Please circulate this announcement to potential applicants and
encourage them to get in contact with one of us.

Best wishes,

Aslan Askarov (aslan@cs.au.dk<mailto:aslan@cs.au.dk>)
