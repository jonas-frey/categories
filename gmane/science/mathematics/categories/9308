Could you please make more precise what you are saying?

Meanwhile, let me go back to your:

> right modules by replacing the 2-sided operation by conjugation which is

and put my "of course not" also here:

Let pi =3D be the 2-element cyclic group, written as pi=3D{1,x}, and let A =
and B
be 2-sided pi-modules defined as follows:

- A and B have the same underlying group, which is the additive group of
integers;

- pi acts trivially on A, that is, xa=3Da=3Dax;

- pi acts on B by xb=3D-b=3Dbx.

Then your functor will send A and B to the same pi-module, while A and B ar=
e
obviously not isomorphic. Therefore your functor is not an equivalence.

Okay, your argument seems sound. But consider the following. If Z is a free
group, say Z =3D F(X), then you can show that for any Z-module M (if M is a
pi-module a homomorphism Z --> pi makes M into a Z-module of course), then
for either a right or a 2-sided module, it is trivial to see that Der(Z,M) =
=3D
M^X. That is, any function X --> M extends in a unique way to a derivation
Z --> M. Now resolve an arbitrary Z with G^2Z =3D=3D=3D> GZ ---> Z and then=
  we get
an equalizer Der(Z,M) ---> Der(GZ,M) =3D=3D=3D> Der(G^2Z,M) or Der(Z,M) ---=
>
Der(GC,M) =3D=3D=3D> Der(G^2Z,M) which is Der(GZ,M) ---> M^Z =3D=3D=3D> M^{=
GZ} for
whichever kind of module you have. But, the ismorphisms are not natural
(except with respect to maps of the basis, which G\epsilon is, but \epsilon
G isn't) and so the two versions of Der(Z,M) may well be different and henc=
e
the two versions of Y.

I guess Jon didn't correctly describe the category of pi-modules.

Dear Michael,

Although the answer to your question is "Of course not!", it is a very
interesting question because it inspires very interesting questions about
internal actions in semi-abelian categories. In this message I shall,
however, only explain why is it "Of course not!" (with "!").

1. The category of pi-modules can be identified with the category of
Z[pi]-modules, where Z[pi] is the group ring over pi. Now, suppose, for
simplicity, that pi is abelian. Then you question can be stated as:

Are the rings Z[pi] and Z[pi x pi] Morita equivalent?

Of course not, because two commutative rings are Morita equivalent if and
only if they are isomorphic. Well, for some funny groups they are, but I
know you are not asking asking about funny groups.

2. Your functor from 2-sided modules to split epis is fine, but it is not a=
n
equivalence, e.g. because your structure on Y will not allow you to recover
the pi-module structure on M from the Beck module structure on Y-->pi. In
fact one can prove the following:

Two 2-sided pi-module structures * and # on M give the same Beck modules
structures on a chosen pi-->Y-->pi if and only if

x*m*(inverse of x) =3D x#m#(inverse of x) for every x in pi and every m in =
M.

For example if we assume that both left actions are trivial, then the right
actions will have to coincide, as in Beck's theory.

Remark: but you never mention what happened after Beck - I mean Bourn
protomodularity and internal actions...

Best regards,
George
