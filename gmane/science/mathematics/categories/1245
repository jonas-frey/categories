                        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


                Workshop on Refinement and Abstraction

                           Nov 15-17, 1999

                              ETL Osaka
                                Japan

Refinement has become an important research field in computer science.
It was first proposed in the engineering context of verification of
large scale programs, or "verification in the large."  The idea was to
put together a proof that a program behaves correctly assuming the
correctness of the library modules in use and a correctness proof of
those modules, obtaining a full proof of program correctness.  There
have been scientific attempts to analyse refinement using universal
algebra, relational algebra and lattice theory.  In the late 90's,
those mathematical tools have extended to category theory, and a
deeper connection with traditional programming semantics is now being
sought.

On the other hand, the programming technique called "abstract
interpretation" has turned out to be useful for software verification.
It has led to a hybrid method called abstract model checking, which is
an amalgamation of the deductive formal proof method and model
checking.  In particular, abstraction is useful in reducing the number
of states of a transition system, making model checking more tractable
in many cases.

The words "refinement" and "abstraction" sound as though they have
opposite directions.  The two approaches, however, seem to have much
in common.  For instance, transformations between two models (an
"abstract" model and "concrete" model) play an essential role in both
methods.  The aim of this workshop is to provide an opportunity for
people working in refinement and abstraction to get together and to
learn how the two fields are related.  To that end, we shall limit the
number of attendants (to about 30 people) for economy of
communication.

We plan to publish an after-meeting-booklet containing articles
related to the talks given in the workshop.

Invited speakers:

        Ralph-Johan Back (Abo Akademi University, Turku)
        Patrick Cousot (ENS, Paris)
        He Jifeng (United Nations University, Macau)
        David Schmidt (Kansas State University)
        Bernhard Steffen (University of Dortmund)
	Akira Mori (JAIST, Japan)
