SCOPE AND AIMS
==============

The major goal of the AMAST conferences is to promote research towards
setting software technology on a firm, mathematical basis.  Work towards
this goal is a collaborative, international effort with contributions
from both academia and industry. The envisioned virtues of providing
software technology developed on a mathematical basis include
(a) correctness, which can be proved mathematically,
(b) safety, so that developed software can be used in the implementation
of critical systems,
(c) portability, i.e., independence from computing platforms and
language generations, and
(d) evolutionary change, i.e., the software is self-adaptable and
evolves with the
problem domain.

The previous conferences were held in: Iowa City, Iowa, USA (1989,
1991 and 2000); Twente, The Netherlands (1993); Montreal, Canada
(1995); Munich, Germany (1996); Sydney, Australia (1997); Manaus,
Amazonia, Brazil (1998); Reunion Island, France (2002); Stirling, UK
(2004, colocated with MPC' 04); Kuressaare, Estonia (2006, colocated
with MPC '06).

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY:
- systems software technology
- application software technology
- concurrent and reactive systems
- formal methods in industrial software development
- formal techniques for software requirements, design
- evolutionary software/adaptive systems

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY:
- logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms
- constraint programming and concurrency
- program verification and transformation
- programming calculi
- specification languages and tools
- formal specification and development case studies

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS:
- logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra
- algebraic foundations for languages and systems, coinduction
- theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning
- logics of programs
- algebra and coalgebra

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers):
- software development environments
- support for correct software development
- system support for reuse
- tools for prototyping
- component based software development tools
- validation and verification
- computer algebra systems
- theorem proving systems

IMPORTANT DATES
===============

  * Submission of abstracts: 1 March 2008
  * Submission of full papers: 8 March 2008
  * Notification of authors: 20 April 2008
  * Camera-ready version: 15 May 2008


SUBMISSION
==========

Two kinds of submissions are solicited for this conference: technical
papers and system demonstrations.  Papers may report academic or
industrial progress, and papers which deal with both are especially
well-regarded.

Submission is in two stages.  Abstracts (plain text) must be submitted
by 1 March 2008.  Full papers (pdf) adhering to the llncs style and not
longer than 15 pages (6 pages for system demonstrations) must be
submitted by 8 March 2008.

Submissions will be open soon.

Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted
concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. Accepted
papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.

All papers will be refereed by the programme committee, and will be
judged based on their significance, technical merit, and relevance to
the conference.

The proceedings of AMAST '08 will be published in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series of Springer-Verlag.
