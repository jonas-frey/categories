Dear Vaughan,

There's a big reason (there are also some little reasons, but I'll
mention them later) why this doesn't match some accepted categorical
definitions, and it's to do with the elements of C(1, 1+1).

The topological condition is often stated differently: that every map X
-> 1+1 factors via 1. Thus C(X,1+1) <= C(1,1+1). I think in most
contexts you would want to say that, if anything is connected, 1 is, but
you can easily find C(1,1+1) > 2.

A simple example is with C = Set^2, where C(1,1+1) = 4 (two coproduct
injections, and two more mixed morphisms).

Then with this C, the alternative definition gives a useful notion of
"fibrewise connectedness" for spaces over 2 and it's really just
connectedness in the internal mathematics of (the topos) Set^2. Your
definition is external.

I would say don't persevere with your definition unless you really don't
mind if 1 is disconnected. The different definition of "every map to 1+1
factors via 1" has been quite successful.

That was the big reason. The little reasons I alluded to are that it is
often useful to require every map to 0 also to factor via 1. That
excludes 0 itself from connectedness. This is similar to saying 1 is not
prime. Once you have the 0 and 2 cases for X, then for every finite n (=
1 + ... + 1) you have all maps X -> n factor via 1 - at least, if
coproduct is well enough behaved w.r.t. limits.

In constructive locale theory the standard definition is stronger and
requires that for every discrete I, every map X -> I must factor via 1.
This allows "infinite n". (Classically this can be deduced from the 0
and 2 cases.)

All the best,

Steve.
