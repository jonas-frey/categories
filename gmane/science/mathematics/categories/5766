Okay, I should have guessed.  So the normalized chains functor from
simplicial abelian groups to chain complexes is both Frobenius monoidal and
bilax monoidal?

We were talking a while back about structures like the group algebra of a
finite group, which is both a Frobenius algebra and a bialgebra.

I guess that means every finite group gives a functor from the terminal
category to Vect that's both Frobenius monoidal and bilax monoidal?   Is
there some slick way to understand why?

Best,
