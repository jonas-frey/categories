i meant that he ended up working on toposes, fibrations, and descent
(as foundational structures). i did not mean that he observed the
grothendieck universes (which are perhaps foundational, but not much
of a structure), as my hasty formulation had suggested to some
people. sorry about the confusion (and about taking bandwidth to
correct it),
