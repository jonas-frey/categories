Dear Steve,

I'd be interested in such pointers as well, especially since "classical
automata theory" is a rather horrible mess.  You may want to check out

- Edwin Stewart Bainbridge's thesis "A unified minimal realization theory
  with duality", PhD Thesis, U. of Michigan, 1972.

- R. Betti, "Automi e categorie chiuse" Boll. Un. Mat. Ital. A (5)\(1980),
  44--58

- Kasangian, Kelly, and Rossi "Cofibrations and the realization of
  non-deterministic automata", Cahiers Topologie Geom. Diff. 24, 1 (1983),
  23--46.

Also, Mark William Hopkins presents some interesting ideas on his
WEB-page <http://www.uwm.edu/~whopkins/compalg/index.html>.  A pointer
to the coalgebraic view of automata is Jan Rutten's page
<http://homepages.cwi.nl/~janr/papers>.  You may want to start with
"Automata and coinduction (an exercise in coalgebra). Technical Report
SEN-R9803", which is available for downloading.

Cheers,
