June 9-11, 2015
Palaiseau


A conference will take place in =C9cole Polytechnique (in Palaiseau, near=
=20
Paris,
France) about tools and methods which originate from geometry in=20
concurrency and
rewriting. Details can be found on the dedicated webpage:

http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/hcr.html

Presentation
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The conference on directed algebraic topology, concurrency and rewriting=20
aims at
bringing together researchers interested in applying methods originating =
in
topology and in higher-dimensional rewriting. It is motivated by the=20
discovery,
over the recent years, of many connections between the study of concurren=
t
processes from a topological point of view and rewriting methods and
structures. It will be interested in applications of those fields to=20
problems
commonly encountered in computer science, in the study of concurrent and
distributed processes, in semantics of programming languages, but also=20
to more
theoretical questions arising from the study of structures found in=20
algebraic
topology such as operads and higher-dimensional categories.
