  I thought I had invented bicategories in 1967, and that, at the very=20=

beginning of the paper, in =A71, I had defined the two composition laws=20=

and drawn pictures to explain them. Of course I denoted by capital=20
letters the 1-cells, thinking of functors, and by small letters the=20
2-cells, thinking of natural transformations. That certainly makes a=20
tremendous difference with Susan Niefield's notation who uses the=20
converse convention and amply justifies Marco Grandis in giving=20
references dated 1994 and 1996, i.e. more than 25 years posterior to my=20=

original paper.
