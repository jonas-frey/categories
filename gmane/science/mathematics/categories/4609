In this discussion I would like to mention some things about Alexander =
Grothendieck:

In 1958 at Edinburgh ICM (me very callow!) I happened to hear Raoul Bott =
say 2 things which expressed his own amazement about AG:

One was that AG could play with concepts and make something real of it. =
(Compare AG's comment to me much later: `The introduction of the cipher =
0 or the group concept was general nonsense too, and mathematics was =
more or less stagnating for thousands of years because nobody was around =
to take such childish steps ...',) I like the idea that `childish steps' =
should still be possible in mathematics, and may be more fun than trying =
the famous problem line. In fact Saul Ulam told me at a conference in =
Sicily in 1964 that a young person may think that the most ambitious =
thing to do is to try for solving a famous problem; but this might =
distract them from developing the mathematics most appropriate to them. =
I was not in danger of the former, but I thought it interesting that =
someone so good as Ulam should make this comment, and think it worth  =
publicising, since it is relevant to aims. =20

The other comment of Bott was that AG was prepared to work very hard to =
make things become tautologous. Should one say this is also (except in =
the exercises!) the intention of Bourbaki ?=20

AG also mentioned to me that his initial direction at Paris was not =
viewed favourably until it proved the generalisation of the Riemann-Roch =
theorem!=20
