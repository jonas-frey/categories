Applications are invited for several postdoctoral researcher
positions in the Department of Software Science at Taltech
(Tallinn University of Technology) working with Pawel
Sobocinski on compositionality and applied category theory.

Compositionality describes and quantifies how compound
systems can be assembled out of their constituent parts in
a way that respects the underlying semantics. Compositional
design is necessary for trustworthy software and leads to the
development of correct and efficient data structures and
algorithms. The inter-disciplinary group will work on
compositional approaches to various application domains,
including models of concurrency, control theory and
cyber-physical systems, game theory, relational algebra and
database theory, and machine learning. The language and
techniques of category theory will serve as a connecting and
unifying lingua franca, with an emphasis on the use of string
diagrams and diagrammatic reasoning. The group will focus on
theoretical as well as practical aspects, including tool
development.

The project is part of a research measure of the Estonian IT
Academy programme, funded by the Estonian state and the
European Social Fund.

Qualifications
--------------

The ideal applicants will have a PhD in Computer Science
(or related field), strong background in at least one
application area as well as in category theory. Experience
in programming and software engineering is also desirable.
In addition to research, the successful applicants will be
expected to contribute to creating a fertile and exciting
intellectual environment, participate and help with the
organisation of a weekly seminar with invited external
speakers from Europe and overseas, and help in organising
and hosting regular international scientific events. There
will also be opportunities to recruit and co-supervise masters
and doctoral students, interact with local industry and with
the general public through outreach activities.

Tallinn and Taltech
-------------------

Tallinn, a historically important Hansa trading port has its
charming old town listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
In recent years it has become one of the fastest-growing IT
hubs and one of the most active startup scenes in Europe.

The working languages at Taltech are Estonian and English.


Further details and application procedure
-----------------------------------------

Compensation will competitive wrt to European standards, and
commensurate with experience. The positions will start on a
mutually agreeable date from September 2019 and last for two
years, with the possibility of an extension.

Interested candidates are invited to contact Pawel Sobocinski
(pawel@cs.ioc.ee) for any questions. To apply, the candidate
should send a CV, a research statement (maximum 3 pages) and
the names and contact details of two people who can be
contacted for a reference to pawel@cs.ioc.ee by June 21, 2019.
