Final Call for Participation

QNET Workshop on Foundations of Quantum Computation
10/11 December 2009
Oxford University Computing Laboratory

http://wiki.comlab.ox.ac.uk/qnet/
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We invite participants for the fourth and final QNET workshop on the =20
Foundations of Quantum Computation. QNET is an EPSRC funded research =20
network on Semantics of Quantum Computation.  The purpose of the =20
network is to support interaction and collaboration between UK =20
researchers working on the application of semantic techniques to =20
quantum computation, however participation in the workshop is open to =20=

anyone, not just UK researchers.  The workshop will take place on the =20=

10th and 11th of December at the Oxford University Computing =20
Laboratory.  The invited speakers of the workshop will be:

* Caslav Brukner, University of Vienna
* Adrian Kent, University of Cambridge

In addition, there will be 19 contributed talks, covering a broad =20
range of topics related to the foundations of quantum computation, =20
ranging from Bell inequalities to Chu spaces.  The full programme is =20
available from the workshop website.

Registration is required, but free; to register email =
qnet.workshop@gmail.com=20
.=13

The QNET workshop is co-located with QUOXIC, a smaller quantum =20
computing workshop, taking place on the afternoon of the 9th of =20
December.  QNET participants are welcome to attend the QUOXIC meeting =20=

as well -- see http://qunat.org/quoxic/ for the programme.
