Dear Colleagues,
   Below is the First Call for Papers for MFPS 24, which will be held
on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania from May 22 through
May 24, 2008, with a Tutorial Day on May 21.
   Best regards,
   Mike Mislove



			   CALL FOR PAPERS

			        MFPS XXIV
	    <http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps24.htm>

		   Twenty-fourth Conference on the
		     Mathematical Foundations of
			Programming Semantics

		      University of Pennsylvania
			 Philadelphia, PA USA
                            May 22 - 25, 2008

	  Partially Supported by US Office of Naval Research


The MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic,
and computer science which are related to models of computation, in
general, and to the semantics of programming languages, in particular.
The series has particularly stressed providing a forum where
researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and exchange
ideas about problems of common interest. As the series also strives to
maintain breadth in its scope, the conference strongly encourages
participation by researchers in neighboring areas.

TOPICS include, but are not limited to, the following: biocomputation;
categorical models; concurrent and distributed computation;
constructive mathematics; domain theory; formal languages; formal
methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; logic; non-classical
computation; probabilistic systems; process calculi; program analysis;
programming-language theory; quantum computation; rewriting theory;
security; specifications; topological models; type systems; type
theory.

The Twenty-fourth Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics (MFPS XXIV) will take place on the campus of
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA USA from Thursday, May 22
through Sunday, May 25, 2008.

The Organising Committee for MFPS consists of Stephen Brookes (CMU),
Achim Jung (Birmingham), Catherine Meadows (NRL), Michael Mislove
(Tulane), and Prakash Panangaden (McGill). The local arrangements for
MFPS XXIV are being overseen by Andre Scedrov (Penn).

The INVITED SPEAKERS for MFPS XXIV are

    Samson Abramsky, Oxford
    Luca Cardelli, Microsoft Research, Cambridge
    Dusko Pavlovic, Kestrel Institute
    Benjamin Pierce, Penn
    Phil Scott, Ottawa
    James Worrell, Oxford

In addition, there will be four special sessions:
  - A session honoring Phil Scott on the occasion of his 60th
birthday year, which is being organized by Rick Blute (Ottawa) and
Andre Scedrov (Penn).

  - A session on Systems Biology will be held in conjunction with
Luca Cardelli's plenaary talk. It is being organized by Jean Krivine
(LIX).

  - A third session will be devoted to Type Theory. It is being
organized by Benjamin Pierce and by Robert Harper (CMU) will be held
in conjunction with Benjamin Pierce's plenary talk.

  - The fourth special session will be on Security, and will be
organized by Catherine Meadows (NRL) in conjunction with Dusko
Pavlovic's plenary talk.

Further, there will be a TUTORIAL DAY on May 21.  The topic will be
Category Theory and Its Applications to Theoretical Computer Science.
It is being organized by Phil Scott (Ottawa); the speakers will be
announced at a later date. This event will be free to all those who
are interested in attending.

The remainder of the program will consist of papers selected by the
following PROGRAM COMMITTEE

    Andrej Bauer (Ljubljana), CHAIR
    Ulrich Berger (Swansea)
    Lars Birkedal (Copenhagen)
    Jens Blanck (Swansea)
    Steve Brookes (CMU)
    Bob Coecke (Oxford)
    Karl Crary (CMU)
    Martin Escardo (Birmingham)
    Achim Jung (Birmingham)
    Jean Krivine (LIX)
    James Laird (Sussex)
    Paul Levy (Birmingham)
    Catherine Meadows (NRL)
    Michael Mislove (Tulane)
    Catuscia Palamidessi (INRIA)
    Prakash Panangaden (McGill)
    Alex Simpson (Edinburgh)
    Christopher Stone (Harvey Mudd)
    Thomas Streicher (Darmstadt)
    James Worrell (Oxford)
