Dear Tony

Yes, this is true. It is a case of Brian Day's convolution theorem: see
[Thesis2] Construction of Biclosed Categories (PhD Thesis, University
of New South Wales, 1970) http://www.math.mq.edu.au/~street/DayPhD.pdf.

[3] Day, Brian. On closed categories of functors. 1970 Reports of the
Midwest Category Seminar, IV pp. 1--38 Lecture Notes in Mathematics,
Vol. 137 Springer, Berlin

Brian deals with enriched categories. For ordinary categories, your D
is a symmetric comonoidal category via the "cotensor product" defined
by diagonal D --> D x D; so it becomes a promonoidal category with P
(a,b;c) = D(a,c) x D(b,c). The convolution tensor product on Fun(D,C)
reduces to the pointwise one.

For enriched categories, D would need to be symmetric comonoidal
(e.g. if D were a free V-category on an ordinary category). When V =
Vect, each "cosymmetric" bialgebra is a one-object such D.

However, there are presumably other references for the particular
case you have in mind as there are for the bialgebra case.
