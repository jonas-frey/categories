now that i think about i guess it was crane rather than yetter who
started using the term "categorification".

is it correct that lawvere and schanuel use the term "objectification"
(or something like that) to mean pretty much the same thing as what
crane meant by "categorification"?  i think i might actually prefer
"objectification" here but i mostly hang out near sub-communities
where "categorification" has caught on to a certain extent.
