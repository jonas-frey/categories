Ah! You are quite correct. I was hasty in saying that the Galois theory
situation is an example of the result I am interested in. The reason it
does not work is that the reflection HI does not induce a fibred monad
on C. The semi-left-exactness ensures the simple formula for the
reflection: A--->B goes to the pullback of HIA ----> HIB along
B---->IHB. What it does not ensure is that pullback commutes with
reflection---which would be to ask that HI be left exact.

This deficiency also applies to the example I started with, of a locally
connected topos E---->S. The "fibred monad" Delta pi_0 is only fibred
over S, whereas I need it to be fibred over E. So in fact it seems that
a correct example is given by a topos with totally connected components
--- meaning that the left adjoint pi_0 of Delta preserves pullbacks. In
this case, then, the analogue of (2) does hold.
