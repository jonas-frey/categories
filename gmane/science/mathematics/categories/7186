Registration for library.nu is no longer possible.  See:

https://www.facebook.com/pages/librarynu/115557691886871

e.d.


Library.nu is closed on registration. I have no control over this. Main
reason is Library.nu ranked 7th in the world for usage of its type. Now
they have legal maters to deal with. They are trimming back there usage
by closing registration. However this has not only happening to
Library.nu. Its happening all over the web. SOPA and collages are trying
to shut down free software sites. SOPA never passed, But is being done
under stealth. Next few months you will see less and less of the web
free. Government of the United States is after file sharing host.
Passing DNS blocks on many countries. The ending goal is the end of the
internet as we know it. A move to a internet 2 type system ran by
governments of the world. Once there is more using internet 2 and all
major search providers switch.(Google, Bing, Aol, Yahoo, Facebook and
twitter) They will shut down Internet 1. New system will be a cloud
based system where the government can track every file on the web. (Bot
AI) Before a file goes to your pc. it must pass threw a cloud system.
Before a user can connect to the internet, They will have to go threw
valid ID checks on the cloud system. This is a move to control media and
the world in the end. We will lose the last freedom we have. Political
members of our governments don't work for us. They work for a global
agenda to control us all. They must play there parts in censoring the
web if they want there power and money in return. (Just greed)

If Library.nu ever opened back up registration it will be a miracle.
Legal maters is the main key why there can be no invites. If you have an
account don't over use it else you will be blocked as well.

I have no control over accounts. Nor can I add new members to there site.

However this is why I made Essentials For Knowledge. A way for us to
still be able to share info and get textbooks and e-books on the web. I
have spent the last 2 weeks looking for the best websites. also spent
over 80+ hours testing them posting them in a table html. Then answering
questions. I spent most of the time searching for these sites. There is
1000s of crappy spam sites out there. Some where not even worth calling
an e-book site. All sites I found good where ranked 5 stars max. but if
the site was based on what the users really wanted it was ranked 6 stars.

Sorry all I can not undo what has been done, however I have not been
sitting on my hands :)
