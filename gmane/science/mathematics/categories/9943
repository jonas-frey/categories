To add another data point, there is the 1966 book

M. Hasse und L. Michler, Theorie der Kategorien, Berlin, VEB Deutscher
Verlag der Wissenschaften, 1966

which is mentioned in this report

https://www.mfo.de/document/0908a/OWR_2009_08.pdf ("Mini-Workshop:
Category Theory and Related Fields: History and Prospects")

This ties for year of publication with

Brinkmann, H.-B., Puppe, D., Kategorien und Funktoren
(Berlin/Heidelberg/New York, LNM 18, 1966

And following

Ehresmann, Charles, Cat=C3=A9gories et structures, Paris: Dunod 1965

(perhaps ironically, Charles Ehresmann was already doing *internal*
category theory to some extent by 1959. However: in the linked 2009
OWR Ageron writes "characterizations of Ehresmann as being a category
theorist... misses the point, scientifically and sociologically: he
cannot be characterized better than being during all of its life a
structure theorist.")

Mike Barr mentioned privately the 1966 meeting at Oberwolfach

Tagung =C3=BCber Kategorien 17. - 24. Juli 1966

("Conference on categories")

So I guess mid-1960s is likely to be the date.
