   MCU'95 and MCU'98 gave rise to TCS special issues on "Universal 
Machines and Computations" : 168-2 (1996) and 231-2 (2000). The interest
of computer scientists for the topics of the conference increased during 
the last years. New domains have appeared, continuing the traditional
approaches in a natural way. This explains why a regular scientific
meeting on this topics must hold, at least each three years.
Initially the name of the conference was "MACHINES ET CALCULS UNIVERSELS" 
(in French); the English translation was "Universal Machines and
Computations" and this was the title of the corresponding TCS issues. In
order to keep the same abbreviation, the new English name of the conference 
is "MACHINES, COMPUTATIONS AND UNIVERSALITY".

CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS

   Besides invited lectures, about thirty contributions are planned. As a first
step, lectures and contributions will be published in a volume of Lecture Notes
in Computer Science devoted to the proceedings of the conference. Participants 
will receive that volume at their arrival.
   Contributions should be submitted as 12 page papers with an extra page
indicating the name of the author(s), his/her/their affiliation, e-mail and
addresses as well as the title of the contribution, a list of key-words and
a short abstract within 300 words. Submissions must conform to the usual
LNCS format, see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.  
   Contributions will be submitted by e-mail as a NON ENCODED PostScript file 
(any encoding will entail rejection of the submission). Accepted contributions
will possibly have to be corrected according to the remarks of the referee. In 
any case, accepted contributions should be send in LATEX format, conform to 
instructions to be found at the above URL. 

Please, keep in mind the following dates :

         Deadline for submission (extended) :      December 15, 2000  *NEW*
         Notification of acceptance or rejection : February  1, 2001
         Deadline for corrected version of accepted papers :
                                                   February 15, 2001
                                                   
TCS SPECIAL ISSUE

   A special issue of Theoretical Computer Science devoted to "MCU'2001,
Machines, Computations and Universality", will be published on the topics of 
the conference.  A selection of the best works of the conference, among invited
lectures and accepted contributions will be published in this special issue.
It will be possible for a paper accepted for the Proceedings to be extended for
the special issue, provided that the selection process for the special issue 
accepts again the paper.

GRANTS FOR STUDENTS :

If our grant applications are successful enough, a certain number of grants
will be presented to young postdoc researches or PhD students in order to
attend the sessions of the conference.

REGISTRATION FEES :

In order to attending the conference, send your registration form by surface 
mail at the below indicated address, by FAX or by e-mail. Registration fees 
amount to 300 US$ if paid before March 1st 2001 and to 350 US$ after that date. 
In that latter case, they must be paid to the conference organization 
account before May, 1st, 2001. ALL participants have to pay the registration 
fees and please, take notice that the fees must be paid in EURO. 
Please, note that registration fees will be received by the University of Metz
at an account that will later be indicated.
