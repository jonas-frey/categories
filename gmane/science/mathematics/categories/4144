			   CALL FOR PAPERS

			      WADT 2008
		    19th International Workshop on
		   Algebraic Development Techniques

		    Pisa, Italy, June 13-16, 2008

	      Home page: http://www.di.unipi.it/wadt2008


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

After having joined forces with CMCS for CALCO'07 in Bergen, WADT
takes place in 2008 as an individual workshop and in its traditional
format.

			    Aims and Scope

The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many
aspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born as
formal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers
new specification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as
object-oriented, aspect-oriented, agent-oriented, logic and
higher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range of
application areas (including information systems, concurrent,
distributed and mobile systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

			  Topics of interest

Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:

 - foundations of algebraic specification
 - other approaches to formal specification, including process calculi
    and models of concurrent, distributed and mobile computing
 - specification languages, methods, and environments
 - semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
 - model-driven development
 - graph transformations, term rewriting and proof systems
 - integration of formal specification techniques
 - formal testing and quality assurance
 - validation and verification

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

		     Workshop Format and Location

The workshop will take place over four days (Friday to Monday) at
Hotel Santa Croce in Fossabanda, a former monastery in the center of
Pisa. It will include presentations selected on the basis of submitted
abstracts as well as three invited talks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

			     Submissions

The scientific programme of the workshop will include presentations of
recent results and ongoing research. The presentations will be
selected by the Steering Committee on the basis of submitted abstracts
according to originality, significance, and general interest.

The abstracts must be up to two pages long including references, and
should be formatted preferably using the standard Springer-Verlag LNCS
style. If a longer version of the contribution is available, it can be
made accessible on the web and referenced in the abstract.

The abstracts have to be submitted electronically via the EasyChair
system, at URL

	 http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=WADT2008.

The final versions of the selected abstracts will be included in a
hand-out for the workshop participants.

After the workshop, selected authors will be invited to submit full
papers for the refereed proceedings, which is expected to be published
as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer Verlag).
