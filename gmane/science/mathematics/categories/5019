Dear All

To add to the confusion:

There is a difference between skeleton and polygon:

skeletos, etc. is a participle

polygon is a noun

polygonon in ancient Greek
polygono in modern Greek

plural form polygona in ancient Greek

>From my recollections:
as a participle (I would have to check this):
skeletos, skeletae, skeleton etc.,

the neutrum  participle "skeleton" also has plural forms:

skeleta (nominativ)
skeleton (genitiv) (long o, i.e. omega)
skeletois (dativ)
skeleta (accusativ)

I cannot check details right now since I
cannot chek my ancient Greek sources right now to confirm.

Best regards

Johannes
