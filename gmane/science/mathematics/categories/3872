Dear Tom,

Here is a rationale for a "cop-out" answer.

When I taught categories at Imperial I had 10 lectures in a Computer
Science department, so there was a limit to what I could do.

For the adjoint functor theorem, I just taught the easy direction -
that a (let's say) left adjoint preserves all colimits that exist.
That's already an extremely useful thing to know. For the converse (a
functor from a cocomplete category is a left adjoint if ...), one can
already prove it for posets as a special case. I didn't go any
further because (a) I didn't have time, and (b) - like you - I didn't
know how to explain the set/class issues. But in retrospect I'm
completely happy with that because the result relies on classical
reasoning principles. In practice there is a lot to be said for
constructing a right adjoint explicitly by other means. Checking that
colimits are preserved then becomes a prudent check before you spend
time looking for an adjoint.

You also mention the issue of the category of groups having "all"
limits. It seems to me that if you show them how infinite products
have the universal property, and how then other limits can be
constructed, then you'll have shown them the main thing they need to
know. I would keep the set/class issue as a secret aside for those
who have seen it before.

Regards,

Steve Vickers.
