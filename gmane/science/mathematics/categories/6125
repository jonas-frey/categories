Dear Mike,

I would suggest a slightly different translation of the title.  I
think that both AG's writing style at the time, and his view of the
paper are better suited by "Some aspects of homological algebra.".

The title "on certain aspects..." suggest that this is just one
selection of topics, and one could as well have selected others.  But
AG intended this paper to hit the very center of homological algebra:
from now on homological algebra is about derived functors on Abelian
categories with enough injectives -- and he justifies this by proving
(against the general expectation) that all sheaf categories have
enough injectives .   Of course there are other resolutions besides
injective, we will use them too, but they are special cases for
special purposes.

Reading the Serre-Grothendieck correspondence you see they were very
off-hand in their language and consciously casual.  But they were not
at all modest.  So AG remarks on "some aspects" -- but he does not
suggest any limitation to just "certain aspects" as if other aspects
might be equally important.

best, Colin
