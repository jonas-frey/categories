A Note on Reduced Categories

Zhaohua Luo

Abstract:

In this note we introduce the notion of a reduced object for any
category A with a strict initial object 0. A pair of parallel maps f, g:
X --> Z is called "disjointed" if its kernel is the initial map to X. It
is called "nilpotent" if any map t: T --> X such that (tf,  tg) is
disjointed is initial. An object X is called "reduced" if any pair of
distinct parallel maps with domain X is not nilpotent. A category A is
called "reduced" if any object is reduced. One can show that any epic
quotient of a reduced object is reduced. A class D of objects of A is
called "uni-dense" if any non-initial object is the codomain of a map
with a non-initial object in D as domain. We show that any uni-dense
class D of a reduced category A is a set of generators. Other properties
and criterions of reduced categories are also studied.
