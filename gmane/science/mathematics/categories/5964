continue off-topic too long already... let's end it, thanks.]

Well, topos may not be a common English word until then, but=20
"common place" is, and that is an English translation of topos,
used for the same meaning, and derived from the rhetorical tradition.=20
Melanchton's late sixteenth century textbook of theology, for example,
was called Loci Communes (=3D common places in Latin). I think that=20
the non-occurrence of topos in English probably says more about the
relative infrequency of Greek terms and the greater frequency of
their Latin equivalents (I haven't got an OED to hand, but it would
be interesting to see if locus was ever used in that sense, and how
early).=20

Not only does the word topos occur in Aristotle's rhetoric,=20
but he wrote a book on topoi, which is one of his logical works.=20
One of the most interesting things about the term, at any rate in Greek,
is that it thus has both logical and geometrical meanings, and that from
very early. I can't help wondering whether Grothendieck had that in
mind: he seems to have read widely enough for that to occur to him.=20
