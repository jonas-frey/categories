(apologies for multiple copies)

SCOPE The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers and students in order to advance the theory of
concurrency, and promote its applications. Interest in this topic is
continuously growing, as a consequence of the importance and ubiquity
of concurrent systems and their applications, and of the scientific
relevance of their foundations. Submissions are solicited in all areas
of semantics, logics and verification techniques for concurrent
systems.

Topics include (but are not limited to) concurrency related aspects
of: models of computation and semantic domains, process algebras,
Petri nets, event structures, real-time systems, hybrid systems,
decidability, model-checking, verification techniques, refinement
techniques, term and graph rewriting, distributed programming, logic
constraint programming, object-oriented programming, typing systems
and algorithms, case studies, tools and environments for programming
and verification.
