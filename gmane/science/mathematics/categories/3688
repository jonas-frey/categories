Dear all, before the flood of complaints begins: I should make it
clear that I am differentiating between the category of directed
graphs, which is certainly a topos, and the category of graphs (i.e.
edges have no orientation) which, as I have just managed to convince
myself, is certainly _not_ a topos.

The original poster was enquiring about the category of graphs, I
believe, rather than the category of directed graphs.
