Dear John,

You ask about a sketch for cartesian closed categories. Have a look at
at the paper "A presentation of topoi as algebraic relative to categories or
graphs (Dubuc-Kelly, J. Alg. 81: 420-433, 1983). This describes something
even tighter: the category of cartesian closed categories is monadic over
the category of graphs.

If you look at the description given in that paper, it clearly contains a
sketch for cartesian closed categories (this depends heavily paper on the
paper Algebres Graphique of Albert Burroni). In fact the Dubuc-Kelly paper
also describes a notion of presentation for finitary monads on Cat; this was
later developed by Kelly and Power into a fully-fledged theory of
presentations for finitary enriched monads on locally finitely preseentable
categories, in their paper " Adjunctions whose counits are coequalizers, and
presentations of finitary enriched monads" (JPAA 89:163-179, 1993).

Regards,

Steve Lack.
