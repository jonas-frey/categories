Readers of these lists may be interested to hear that the following paper
has appeared:

C. F=FChrmann and D. Pym. On categorical models of classical logic and th=
e=20
geometry of interaction.
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 17(5), 2007, 957-1027.

Abstract. It is well known that weakening and contraction cause naive=20
categorical models of the classical sequent calculus to collapse to=20
Boolean lattices. In previous work, summarised briefly herein, we have=20
provided a class of models called /classical categories/ that is sound=20
and complete and avoids this collapse by interpreting cut reduction by a=20
poset enrichment. Examples of classical categories include boolean=20
lattices and the category of sets and relations, where both conjunction=20
and disjunction are modelled by the set-theoretic product. In this=20
article, which is self-contained, we present an improved axiomatisation=20
of classical categories, together with a deep exploration of their=20
structural theory. Observing that the collapse already happens in the=20
absence of negation, we start with negation-free models called /Dummett=20
categories/. Examples of these include, besides the classical categories=20
mentioned above, the category of sets and relations, where both=20
conjunction and disjunction are modelled by the disjoint union. We prove=20
that Dummett categories are MIX, and that the partial order can be=20
derived from hom-semilattices, which have a straightforward=20
proof-theoretic definition. Moreover, we show that the=20
Geometry-of-Interaction construction can be extended from multiplicative=20
linear logic to classical logic by applying it to obtain a classical=20
category from a Dummett category.

Along the way, we gain detailed insights into the changes that proofs=20
undergo during cut elimination in the presence of weakening and=20
contraction.
