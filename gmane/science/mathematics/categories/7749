Even more convincing: The equalizer of those two projections from N x N
must be the diagonal in N x N. But if those projections are equal, their
equalizer is all of N x N. Thus every map to N x N factors through the
diagonal there, i.e., no matter what the object A, for every pair of maps=

f, g: A --> N, we must have f =3D g. It will follow that N is terminal.
