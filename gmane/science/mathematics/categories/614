What on earth does Friedman mean by complicated? As Peter Freyd
pointed out a long time ago, the axioms for an elementary topos are
essentially algebraic -- that is, they live at a very low level
of logical complexity. The very first axiom in anyone's (including
Friedman's) axiomatization of set theory is the axiom of
extensionality, which is not expressible even in coherent logic
(at least, not unless you take not-membership as a primitive
predicate, on the same level as membership).

Unless Friedman can put forward an objective measure of complexity
(as opposed to "unfamiliarity to H. Friedman") which justifies the
above quote, then his challenge is not worth considering.
