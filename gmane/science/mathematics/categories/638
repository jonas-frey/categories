The aim of the workshop is to bring together active researchers interested in the area of nonmonotonic reasoning to discuss current research, results, and problems of both theoretical and practical nature. The format of this workshop is different from earlier nonmonotonic reasoning workshops. NM'98 will consist of five specialized one day workshops to be held at least partly in parallel. The specialized workshops will be surrounded by a plenary program consisting of invited talks and panels. The following specialized workshops are part of NM'98:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Formal Aspects and Applications of Nonmonotonic Reasoning} \\
Chairs: Jim Delgrande, Mirek Truszczynski
\item {\bf Computational Aspects of Nonmonotonic Reasoning} \\
Chairs: Ilkka Niemel\"{a}. Torsten Schaub
\item {\bf Logic Programming} \\
Chairs: J\"{u}rgen Dix, Jorge Lobo
\item {\bf Action and Causality} \\
Chairs: Vladimir Lifschitz, Hector Geffner 
\item {\bf Belief Revision} \\
Chairs: Hans Rott, Mary-Anne Williams.
\end{itemize}
Submission of papers is {\em through the specialized workshops only}. The deadline for submissions is {\bf Feb. 23, 1998}. 

Participation is by invitation only. Those wishing to attend without submitting a paper should send a statement of interest with a short description of research interests and recent work to one of the co-chairs (brewka@informatik.uni-leipzig.de, ini@invariant.hut.fi)
