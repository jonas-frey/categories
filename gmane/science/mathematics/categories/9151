Dear colleagues,


During the year 2017 a special volume of the Tbilisi Mathematical Journal t=
o honor both Peter Freyd and Bill Lawvere on the occasion of their (belated=
) 80th birthdays will be published with me as lead editor and a dozen of ju=
diciously selected guest editors to reflect in a balanced way a variety of =
interests of the honorees.


The idea of dedicating a single volume to both Peter and Bill has as purpos=
e to emphasize the importance that they have had for the second generation =
of category theorists and beyond, just as Sammy Eilenberg and Saunders MacL=
ane did for the first. The fact that I happen to have been the first studen=
t of them both is of course relevant to my having proposed such a volume. H=
owever, the enthusiastic and quick response that I have had from all of the=
  guest editors that I had invited to join me in this enterprise, indicates =
that there is ample support for it.


The details of such a volume can be seen below.

<http://tcms.org.ge/TMJ_Call_honor_of_Professors_Peter.html>I hope that sev=
eral of you will consider this as an opportunity to submit a paper worthy o=
f the honorees.


With best regards,

Marta Bunge.
