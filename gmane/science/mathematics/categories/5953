ACM Symposium on Applied Computing

The ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has gathered scientists =

from different areas of computing over the past twenty-five years. The =

forum represents an opportunity to interact with different communities =

sharing an interest in applied computing.

SAC 2011 is sponsored by SIGAPP and will be hosted by Tunghai =

University, TaiChung, Taiwan.


Software Verification and Testing Track

We invite authors to submit new results in formal verification and =

testing, as well as development of technologies to improve the usability =

of formal methods in software engineering. Also welcome are detailed =

descriptions of applications of mechanical verification to large scale =

software. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

- tools and techniques for verification of large scale software systems
- real world applications and case studies applying software verification
- static and run-time analysis
- abstract interpretation
- model checking
- theorem proving
- correct by construction development
- model-based testing
- verification-based testing
- symbolic execution
- analysis methods for dependable systems
- software certification and proof carrying code


Submissions guidelines

Paper submissions must be original, unpublished work. Submissions should =

be in electronic format, via the START site: =

https://www.softconf.com/b/sac11-tp/. Author(s) name(s) and address(es) =

must not appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference should be =

avoided and made in the third person. Submitted paper will undergo a =

blind review process. Authors of accepted papers should submit an =

editorial revision of their papers that fits within six two-column pages =

(an extra two pages, to a total of eight pages, may be available at a =

charge). Please comply to this page limitation already at submission =

time. Publication of accepted articles requires the commitment of one of =

the authors to register for the conference and present the paper. =

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM SAC 2011 proceedings.
