Can't say I'm a big fan of bureaucratic hurdles.  The goal in our
department is to produce credible researchers.  To do a good job on this
requires a certain investment of time on the part of the adviser.  If
the student is inadequately prepared the adviser's time is wasted,
therefore we set academic hurdles, not bureaucratic ones, for the
purpose of bringing the student up to speed before spending too much of
the adviser's time on what should have been accomplished in courses and
independent study.

What concerns me in this case is the proportion of discussion devoted to
bureaucratic hurdles vs. research accomplishments.  I would be more
comfortable with it the other way round.
