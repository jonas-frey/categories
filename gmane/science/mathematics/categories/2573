Dear colleagues,

    For those who read the most recent long discursion of John Baez, a =
few of the errors in the section on distributive categories merit =
correction:

(1) J. B. suggests that Blass published what Lawvere had already worked =
out. In fact, Lawvere (partly to counteract some incorrect uses of =
infinite series in  analyses of 'data types' in computer science) had =
worked out the algebra of the rig presented by one generator X and one =
relation X=3D1+X^2, roughly by the method in (3) below, and conjectured =
that this rig could be realized as the isomorphism classes in a =
distributive (even extensive) category, which conjecture Blass then =
proved (and a bit more) in "Seven Trees...".

(2) The generalization of Blass's theorem to one generator ond one =
polynomial relation of the 'fixed-point' form X=3Dp(X), where p is a =
polynomial with natural number coefficients and nonzero constant term is =
not, as J. B. seems to suggest, due to Fiore and Leinster; it was part =
of the prize-winning doctoral thesis of Robbie Gates, who (using a =
calculus of fractions) described explicitly the free distributive =
category on one object X together with an isomorphism from p(X) to X, =
proving that this category is extensive and that its rig of isomorphism =
classes satisfies no further relations, i.e. is the rig R presented by =
one generator and the one relation above.

(3) If p is as in (2) and of degree at least 2, the algebra of the rig R =
is made by J. B. to seem mysterious. It is more easily understood in the =
way the X=3D2X+1 case was treated in my "Negative Sets..." paper; just =
show that the Euler and dimension homomorphisms, tensoring with Z and =
with 2 (the rig true/false) respectively, are jointly injective. In this =
case the dimension rig has only three elements, which explains why the =
Euler characteristic captures almost, but not quite, everything.

Greetings to all,
    Steve Schanuel
