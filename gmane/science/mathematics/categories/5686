Points of Business:
-------------------

1. Final Call for Accommodation in the University Residence

This is a final call for requests for accommodation in the university
residence during MFPS 2010 in Ottawa.

There are still several suites available at the discounted rate ($90 per
suite per night or $45 per person per night) and we ask that you contact
Michael Warren (mwarren@uottawa.ca) to request placement in a suite if yo=
u
are interested in staying in such a suite and have not already done so.=20
The suites consist of two individual bedrooms and a shared bathroom and
they are booked from May 5th through (checking out on) May 10th.

2. Banquet Meal Preference Request

In order to obtain a rough approximation of the food preferences for the
conference banquet (to be held at the restaurant of Le Cordon Bleu Cookin=
g
School) we request that any conference participants who plan to attend th=
e
banquet contact Michael Warren (mwarren@uottawa.ca) to specify a food
preference from among the following list of options (all three will be
available at the banquet and we are merely trying to formulate an estimat=
e
of the proportions of each which will be required):  MEAT, FISH, or
VEGETARIAN.  Please also indicate the number of guests (if any) who will
be joining you at the banquet.


Sincerely,

The Local Organizers
