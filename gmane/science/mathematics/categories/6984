Dear Colleagues, this is to let you know about


   A Symposium in Celebration of the Life and Work of Robin Milner


to be held from 16th-18th April 2012 in Edinburgh.


The symposium will feature Robin's colleagues from all areas of his work, as
well as others participating in its continuation. Robin's inspiring
contributions continue to have a profound effect on computer science,
and the symposium will show how his vision has developed our subject over
the last few decades, and how new work continues to build on his many
contributions.


All are welcome to attend this event, whether to hear the thoughts
of leading figures in computer science, or simply to re-make the many
connections that Robin brought into being, through his broad research agenda
and his kindness to all who worked with or near him.


The symposium will be hosted by the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer
Science in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh.


Date: 16-18 April 2012

Place: Informatics Forum, Edinburgh
