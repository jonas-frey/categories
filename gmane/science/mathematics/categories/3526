For those who cannot get a printed copy, I might add that the story
appeared as a 2-page spread in the centerfold of the main section of
the paper, and that the Globe and Mail is the largest daily national
newspaper in Canada. Such prominent placement is unusual for an
article on academia.

The article does not mention category theory, but it does mention that
Gabi might be in need of a girlfriend. Gabi, the Globe and Mail has a
circulation of 2 million; you better get ready for a flood of
applicants :)

Congratulations, -- Peter
