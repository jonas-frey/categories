Even though categories are not algebraic in sets, at least they are
algebraic in graphs, which in turn are algebraic in sets.

While I would have little or no quarrel with any revision of "the"
category of graphs that preserved this fundamental relation between
categories and sets, if the revision you have in mind does not then I
would expect at least some of us here would be very interested in why
you consider your contemplated revision an improvement.
