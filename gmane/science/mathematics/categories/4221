Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic 87
Honouring the 70th birthday of Anders Kock

Patras, 21-23 March 2008

The 87th Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will be held in Patras,
Greece, on 22-23 March 2008.
An extra session will be held in the afternoon of Friday 21 March,
celebrating the 70th birthday of Anders Kock.
A. Joyal, F. W. Lawvere and G. Reyes will participate honouring Anders.


Accommodation Information:

The University of Patras is located in the suburbs, 10 km NE of the
downtown area.
The participants have the options of either staying downtown or in one
of the hotels along the coast near the University.
In the first case they will have to use local transportation (bus or taxi=
).
In the second case they may choose to walk
(weather permitting) or get a ride by the people involved in the
organization. With the second option in mind, a number of rooms has been
reserved at Hotel Achaia Beach and will be available at the price of 69
Euros (single room)  and 85 Euros (double room), provided that reservatio=
n
is confirmed before 15 January 2008.
The hotel is 2,5 km away from the PSSL venue and has the extra advantage
of being close to some fine restaurants and in walking distance from the
cafes, bars and restaurants of the coast of Rion, which starts getting
lively at that time of the year. A small number of rooms will be availabl=
e
until Friday 22 February 2008.

Transportation Information:

Patras is located 220km W of the Athens airport. The best way to approach
it is to use the Athens Suburban Railway (Proastiakos) which stretches
west up to the town of Kiato, on the northern coast of the Peloponnese,
110km away from Patras. The idea is to arrange some private car or coach
rides from Kiato to Patras, according to the date and time of arrival of
most of you. Otherwise there is the option of getting on the (slow, narro=
w
gauge) train to Patras.

meeting's webpage
