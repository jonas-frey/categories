One of the first papers Max Kelly told me to read when I started
graduate work was
Albrecht Dold, "Zur Homotopietheorie der Kettenkomplexe"
Math. Ann. 140 1960 278=96298.
When I returned with a complete translation into English, Max
was very critical. He said that was not the way to read a paper
in another language. Eventually I met Dold several times.

At the invitation of Murray Adelman, Dold visited Macquarie.
At the same time, Steve Schanuel was visiting me. This was
an exciting time since the two visitors recognized that Dold's
work on trace was relevant to Schanuel's work on Euler
characteristic. The two charismatic guests were a delight to
be around. They generated so much excitement about the
mathematics.

Albrecht Dold was a genuine European gentleman and I will
remember him as looking much younger and energetic than
his years.=
