I am in the process of editing my correspondence 1982-1991 with AG which has
been latexed through George Malsiniotis for appearing as part of an Appendix
to a published edition of `Pursuing Stacks'.  I came across the following
extract  which seemed to me to contain points of general interest about
mathematical methodology and sociology, so I give this below, to invite
comments.

 from a letter dated 14 June, 1983,

Your idea of writing a ``frantically speculative" article on
groupoids seems to me a very good one. It is the kind of thing
which has traditionally been lacking in mathematics since the very
beginnings, I feel, which is one big drawback in comparison to all
other sciences, as far as I know. Of course, no creative
mathematician can afford not to ``speculate", namely to do more or
less daring guesswork as an indispensable source of inspiration.
The trouble is that, in obedience to a stern tradition, almost
nothing of this appears in writing, and preciously little even in
oral communication. The point is that the disrepute of
``speculation" or ``dream" is such, that even as a strictly
private (not to say secret!) activity, it has a tendency to
vegetate - much like the desire and drive of love and sex, in too
repressive an environment. Despite the ``repression", in the one
or two years before I unexpectedly was led to withdraw from the
mathematical milieu and to stop publishing, it was more or less
clear to me that, besides going on pushing ahead with foundational
work in SGA and EGA, I was going to write a wholly science-fiction
kind [of] book on ``motives'', which was then the most fascinating
and mysterious mathematical being I had come to meet so far. As my
interests and my emphasis have somewhat shifted since, I doubt I
am ever going to write this book - still less anyone else is going
to, presumably. But whatever I am going to write in mathematics, I
believe a major part of it will be ``speculation" or ``fiction",
going hand in hand with painstaking, down-to-earth work to get
hold of the right kind of notions and structures, to work out
comprehensive pictures of still misty landscapes. The notes I am
writing up lately are in this spirit, but in this case the
landscape isn't so remote really, and the feeling is rather that,
as for the specific program I have been out for is concerned,
getting everything straight and clear shouldn't mean more than a
few years work at most for someone who really feels like doing it,
maybe less. But of course surprises are bound to turn up on one's
way, and while starting with a few threads in hand, after a while
they may have multiplied and become such a bunch that you cannot
possibly grasp them all, let alone follow.
