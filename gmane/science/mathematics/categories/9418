In answer to Mike:

"3) nLab says a sketch is a small category T equipped with subsets (L,C)
of its limit cones and colimit cocones. A model of a sketch is a
Set-valued functor preserving the specified limits and colimits. Is
preserving limits and colimits like a ring homomorphism? Preserving both
limits and colimits sounds like it ought to involve profunctors, but
maybe I'm level slipping." Sketches were introduced by Charles Ehresmann
in 1966 (and developed by us and our research students) in several
papers, among which I'll cite: (i) The main Charles' paper "ESQUISSES ET
TYPES DES STRUCTURES ALG??BRIQUES", Bul. Inst. Pol. Iasi, Tome XIV-1-2,
1968 (in French), reprinted in
http://ehres.pagesperso-orange.fr/C.E.WORKS_fichiers/Ehresmann_C.-Oeuvres_IV_1.pdf
on p. 19-32 (with several Comments in English I added on p. 329-332);
(ii) Our joint paper "Categories of sketched structures", Cahiers
Top.GDC XIII-2, 1972
http://www.numdam.org/article/CTGDC_1972__13_2_104_0.pdf I have been
surprised to see the definition given in nLab of a sketch as a category
with some limit-cones and co-limit-cones. For us, a 'sketch' is a
category S (or even a graph) with some distinguished cones and co-cones
(but not necessarily (co-)limit-cones). And in the above citation we
construct the 'prototype' of the sketch which is constructed by forcing
the (co-)cones to become (co-)limit-cones. Indeed, our idea was that a
sketch describes a 'smaller' presentation of a generalized algebraic
structure (for instance of categories themselves), and from it we
deduced its prototype and also its type (analogue of the theory for
Lawvere algebraic structures). The 'realisation' (or 'model') of a
sketch S in a category C is then a functor from S to C which transforms
the distinguished (co-)cones into (co-)limit-cones. There is no need of
profunctors here. Let us note that C is not required to admit all
(co-)limits, just the images of the distinguished (co-)cones must become
(co-)limit-cones. An initial 1959 example (at the basis of Charles'
definition) was the notion of a 'differentiable category' which is a
model of the sketch of categories into the category of differentiable
maps (which admits limits but only specific co-limits). Sincerely Andree
