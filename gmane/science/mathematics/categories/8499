Dear all,

We invite applications for PhD study at the University of Birmingham.

We are a group of (mostly) theoretical computer scientists who explore
fundamental concepts in computation and programming language
semantics. This often involves profound and surprising connections
between different areas of computer science and mathematics. From
category theory to ??-calculus and computational effects, from topology
to constructive mathematics, from game semantics to program
compilation, this is a diverse field of research that continues to
provide new insight and underlying structure.   See our webpage, with
links to individual researchers, here:

http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/

Information about PhD applications may be found here:

http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-research/

If you are considering applying, please contact any of us.  We will be
very happy to discuss the opportunities available.

Best regards,
the Birmingham CS theory group
