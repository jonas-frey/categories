Dear Category Theorists,
This is a reminder that the early bird registration with lower
conference fee closes on Thursday 29 May (UK time). So if you have not
registered, do consider registering before this date.

http://www.ct2014.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/


As for pre-reserved rooms (which you can book in the registration
process), we have approximately 10 ensuite rooms in Jesus college left
and approximately 10 standard rooms in Fitzwilliam College. When these
are full (or for people who are bringing guests), people will have to
find their own rooms, but there are suggestions on the conference
website. Please bear in mind that the Tour de France is coming to
Cambridge on the 7th of July, so rooms might be harder to get. And on
the 7th of July, many roads will be closed (in case you are staying
that long).

Julia
(for the organisers)
