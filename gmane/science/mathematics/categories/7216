Hi Ignacio,

If C has finite limits (in fact kernels would do) as well as finite
colimits, then Lex[C^op, V] abelian actually implies C abelian.
Indeed, the restricted Yoneda embedding C -> Lex[C^op, V] then
preserves limits and finite colimits, and is fully faithful; whence C
may be identified with a full subcategory of L closed under finite
limits and finite colimits. But any such subcategory of an abelian
category is itself abelian.

This then means that Lex[C^op, V] abelian =3D> C abelian =3D> Lex[C^op, V]
Grothendieck abelian. When V =3D Ab, this is sufficient to ensure that
Lex[C^op, V] is lex-reflective in [C^op, V]. Off the top of my head, I
don't know if the same is true when V =3D k-Mod; I feel like it might be
necessary to assume that, for every f.p. flat k-module M, the functor
M * (-) : C -> C preserves monomorphisms. Maybe that's automatic; I
don't know enough algebra to say for sure.

If C doesn't have kernels, then the situation is more interesting. I
believe it should still be possible to give elementary conditions on C
which are equivalent to L's being abelian. The point is that kernels
do exist in L and so one can work out what it means for L to satisfy
the kernel-cokernel exactness conditions for maps between
representables in terms of structure in C. This will give some
necessary conditions on C for L to be abelian. With any luck they will
also be sufficient, though it might be necessary to consider a wider
class of maps in L than merely those between representables.

A relevant article, I think, is

C. Centazzo, R.J. Wood
An extension of the regular completion
J. Pure Appl. Algebra, 175 (2002), pp. 93=96108

That deals with the non-additive context but the same ideas should
apply. I am also wondering if Mike Shulman's work on unary sites is
relevant; see his CT2011 slides.
