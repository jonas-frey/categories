Isabelle's internal logic comes from Lambek and Scott.  It is an
instance of Example 1.1 on page 132, where all types are assumed to be
non-empty.  However, even their full system is unacceptable to many
constructivists because it is impredicative.  Constructive theories,
like a certain commuting diagrams package, have a surprising tendency
to "time out".
