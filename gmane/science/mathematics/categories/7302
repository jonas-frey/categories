In the 1952 document at
http://mathdoc.emath.fr/archives-bourbaki/PDF/nbt_029.pdf the only
mathematician
"pr\'{e}sent" referenced by first name only is Sammy.

I was permitted to audit a graduate course on category theory guided
by Sammy at Columbia University in the early 1960s.
I recall his insistence that mathematical structure is given by data
and conditions. Is that idea
implicit or explicit in Bourbaki?  Has that idea been superceded? How
does it relate to the
development of  algebraic theories as understood by Lawvere, Linton,
Barr-Wells, the Elephant, and so on?
