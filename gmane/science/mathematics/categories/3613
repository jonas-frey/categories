Preliminary Announcement and First Call for Papers
ALGEBRAIC AND TOPOLOGICAL METHODS IN NON-CLASSICAL LOGICS III
(TANCL'07)
5-9 August, 2007
St Anne's College (University of Oxford)
Oxford, England

This international  conference is the third in the series Algebraic  and
Topological methods in Non-Classical Logics (TANCL). The first  was held
in 2003 in Tbilisi, Georgia:

http://sierra.nmsu.edu/morandi/TbilisiConference/Home.html

and the second in 2005 in Barcelona, Spain:

http://www.mat.ub.es/~logica/meeting2005/

AIMS AND SCOPE

The topics covered by TANCL'07 lie within a well-established and
active area of mathematical logic.   It is hoped to attract to the
meeting established researchers and also postdoctoral and graduate
students, from the UK and overseas.

The objectives are

(1) to provide a showcase for recent advances in the field;

(2) to facilitate the exchange of ideas and expertise
between  mathematicians, logicians, and theoretical computer
scientists working on many facets of
non-classical logic;

(3) to foster future collaborations.

The programme will focus on three interconnecting  mathematical
themes central to the  study of non-classical logics and their
applications: algebraic, categorical, and topological methods. Three  more
specialized satellite workshops are planned (see below).

INVITED SPEAKERS

Samson Abramsky, University of Oxford, UK
Wojciech Buszkowski, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poland
Alexander Kurz, University of Leicester, UK
Jean-Eric Pin, University of Paris, France
Giovanni Sambin, University of Padova, Italy
Yde Venema, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands
Frank Wolter, University of Liverpool, UK

PROGRAMME COMMITTEE

Guram Bezhanishvili (Chair), New Mexico State University, USA
Leo Esakia, Georgian Academy of Sciences, Georgia
Mai Gehrke, New Mexico State University, USA
Silvio Ghilardi, University of Milan , Italy
Ramon Jansana, University of Barcelona , Spain
Peter Jipsen, Chapman University, USA
Hiroakira Ono, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Japan
Hilary Priestley, University of Oxford, UK

CONTRIBUTED PAPERS

There will be an opportunity for participants to offer short talks,  the
selection to be made by the Programme Committee on the basis of  submitted
half-page abstracts. Details of the procedure will be on  the conference
homepage.

SATELLITE WORKSHOPS

It is planned to hold  three specialized satellite workshops at
Oxford University Computing Laboratory:

Categorical Quantum Logic (convened by Bob Coecke)

Coalgebraic Logic (convened by Alexander Kurz)

Spatial and Spatio-temporal Logics (convened by Michael Zakharyaschev).

CONFERENCE ORGANISERS

Mai Gehrke and Hilary Priestley

They can be contacted by email at tancl07@maths.ox.ac.uk

KEY DATES

Deadline for submission of abstracts: 1 May
Acceptance notification: 15 May
Deadline for registration and reservation of accommodation:  1 June

VENUE

The conference will be held at St Anne's College, Oxford [
http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk], one of the colleges of Oxford
University. The college has excellent conference facilities and is  within
10 minutes' walk of the centre of the city of Oxford.
Accommodation of various types will be available.

REGISTRATION

Registration for the conference and reservation of accommodation will  be
through the conference homepage.

FINANCIAL SUPPORT

We hope to be able to provide financial support for a number of
graduate students and perhaps for others who can make a strong case.

FURTHER INFORMATION AND EXPRESSION OF INTEREST

A conference homepage is being set up at

http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/notices/events/special/tancl07/

In the meantime, expression of interest by potential participants is
welcomed; please email tancl07@maths.ox.ac.uk
