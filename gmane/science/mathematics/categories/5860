Since I know very little about these issues,
I'm not ready to accept your claim that it is true.
(I know that you sketched a way for me to verify it
by performing some calculations on my laptop,
but it would take a while for me to figure out what to program
and then to convince myself that the output meant what you say.)

However, I am happy to agree that the statement is true or false.

Anyone who doubts excluded middle for *this* proposition
is not merely a constructivist, or even an intuitionist.
Excluded middle for this proposition is provable in Heyting arithmetic.
While a straightforward calculation of the factors of M
would not fit into the physical universe, it is still finite.

Those who doubt excluded middle (or meaningfulness) for this proposition
go beyond intuitionism; they have been called "ultra-intuitionists",
although the preferred term these days is "ultra-finitists".
As someone who is quite comfortable with constructivism,
I still find ultra-finitism a very strange way to think.

Ultra-finitists definitely have a different recieved wisdom about N
from what the rest of us have received.

Ob categories:  Does anybody know any work on ultra-finitism
from the perspective of categorial logic? (somewhat in the way
that topos theory can provide a perspective on constructivism).
I doubt that any exists, but I would it would be nice if it did.
