Deutchland), CSL'88 (Duisburg, Deutchland), and CSL'87 (Karlsruhe,
Deutchland), CSL'99 will be held in Madrid (Spain). The event is
organized jointly by the Computer Science Departments (SIP and DACYA)
of Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

The scientific program includes 34 selected papers from among 91
submissions, five invited lectures, and two tutorials on theorem
proving and rewriting techniques, scheduled on September 24
afternoon (Friday) and September 25 morning (Saturday), immediately
after the main conference.

In addition to the scientific program, the social program includes
an excursion to Segovia (a nearby historic city), and a conference
dinner. Madrid, a city of contrasts, traditional and contemporary at
the same time, offers the opportunity to enjoy both Spain and one of
the most attractive capitals in Europe.
