I would like to generalize this to include Springer and Bertelsmann
(which, I think, includes Springer now).  I haven't had any dealings with
any of them since about 1995.  They are evil and the sooner we get rid of
them the better.  About a month ago, I asked Springer about permission to
reprint something from about 1980 if I recall properly.  Not even the
courtesy of a refusal.  We are doing out bit with TAC, but why can't the
mathematical community as a whole see the damage that is being done to our
profession?

An ostrich is more intelligent than the average congressman.  The
ostrich does not bury its head in the sand.
