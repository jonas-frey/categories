This message was stimulated by John Baez's week257 which, though
interesting as usual, has one item of special interest to me at this time=
.
 I haven't yet looked at Minhyong Kim's work, and I don't know how this
fits in with number theory or categories, but a friend is encouraging me
to go to the following conference on Benford's Law:=20
http://www.ece.unm.edu/benford .

Does anybody on this list (including you, John) know of a connection
between Benford's Law and any work in category theory?  I would really
like to hear about it if so.

Thanks,
Mike
