Dear Tony,

Yes, this is true. You could even take it as a definition of terminal
object.

No, this is not true. The category sSet* is pointed (it has a terminal
object which is also initial), while the category of functors from
([0],Delta)^op to Set is not.

I'm not sure if there was supposed to be a connection between the two
questions, but just in case, I might point out that [0] is not initial in
Delta (in fact it is terminal).
