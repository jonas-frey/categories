[Please forward as appropriate.]

UWO plans to hire two postdocs to start in summer 2016.  The
application deadline is January 4, but applications received after
this time will also be considered.  I have included the ad below.

Applicants in higher category theory, homotopy type theory, homotopy
theory and its applications, and other areas represented in the
department would be particularly welcome.

Our department has a very active postdoctoral program.  There are
currently 9 postdoctoral fellows, many of whom will be continuing
next year, so there will be a lot going on.  We also have a busy
seminar schedule with many visitors.  More information about the
department is available at  http://www.math.uwo.ca/

The positions have a reduced teaching load of just two half-courses.
A "half-course" is a 13-week course meeting for 3 or 4 hours each week.
Note also that the cost of living in London is quite low.

Feel free to direct any questions to either Rick Jardine or myself.

Each position has a two-year term with a flexible start date of July 1,
2016. The salary will be $44,000 CDN per year, plus a tax-free
research fund of $1,500 per year.  The positions will involve teaching
two half-courses per year, in addition to research.  Candidates should

positions is subject to budgetary considerations.

All applications should include a curriculum vitae, a research
statement, and at least three letters of reference.  At least one
letter of reference should comment on the teaching abilities of the

Screening of applications will commence on January 4, 2016, and will
continue until all positions are filled.
