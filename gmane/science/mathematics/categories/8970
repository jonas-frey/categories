Dear all,

We are pleased to announce that from June 4-10, 2017, there will be a
workshop on Homotopy Type Theory, organized as part of the AMS
Mathematics Research Communities program and held in the Snowbird
Resort in Utah.

The goal of the workshop is to bring together advanced graduate
students and postdocs having some background in one (or more) areas
such as algebraic topology, category theory, mathematical logic, or
computer science, with the goal of learning how these areas come
together in homotopy type theory, and working together to prove new
results.  Basic knowledge of just one of these areas will be
sufficient to be a successful participant.

For more information about the workshop, including the list of sample
topics that participants may be working on and the registration
information, please see the website:

http://www.ams.org/programs/research-communities/2017MRC-1

All accepted into the program will receive financial support (room and
board at the Snowbird Resort and up to $650 towards airfare). Although
the application deadline is *March 1st, 2017,* early registration will
be highly appreciated, as it will help us plan the event and ensure
that everyone gets the most out of it.

The majority of the positions are allocated to U.S. citizens and
people who are affiliated with U.S. institutions, but a smaller number
are also open to international participants.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact any of the organizers.

Dan Christensen, Chris Kapulkin, Dan Licata, Emily Riehl, Mike Shulman
