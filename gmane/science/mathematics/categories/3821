I think it's more likely to refer to John's unpublished (indeed,
unwritten) paper "Some concrete dualities". This appeared as an
abstract in the AMS Notices in 1974 (vol. 21, pp. A567-8), and I heard
John talk about it at an Oberwolfach meeting in 1975. In 1981 I asked
John when we could expect to see the paper in print (since I was then
writing "Stone Spaces", in which I wanted to refer to it), and he replied
that he was still working on the write-up of his 1973 Oberwolfach talk.
(The implication was that he'd get around to the 1975 talk when the
earlier one was out of the way, but I'm pretty sure he never did.)
