Dear Vaughan,

I would try to encapsulate what I said in "Locales and toposes as
spaces". My aim there was to present ideas (of generalized space) that
have been known to topos-theorists from the start, but which tend to get
buried in the technical development. I wanted to show how results in Mac
Lane and Moerdijk, or in the Elephant, can be read in a non-standard
order to paint a particular picture. (To indulge myself in metaphors
again, the blind toddler wanders right underneath, between the legs,
feels nothing, and concludes the elephant is very like a generalized
space. In its innocence, it never developed the respectful awe of the
scary bits.)

Some of the encapsulation is in my Linz lecture slides

    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/LinzTalk.pdf

My aim there was to explain how sheaves can be viewed as continuous
set-valued maps, and what that tells us about continuity. In particular,
I wanted to support the idea that "continuous" means "geometrically
definable". This leads to the idea of geometric morphism between toposes
as continuous map between generalized spaces. But then non-classical
reasoning (no excluded middle, no axiom of choice, no impredicative
constructions) enters in immediately as part of the geometricity.

Best regards,

Steve.
