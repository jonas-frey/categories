Thanks. I did not mean it as cryptic.

Yes, and also taking the choice of new or revised terminology
seriously when it seems called for, just as this thread has been
doing.

But the problem is not only to entice people unwilling to learn new
terminology.  There is also the problem of telling where change truly
is needed and what change.  I do not offer this as a new thought but
just to keep it in the discussion.

I will say, for my part, I have no objection to learning a new system
of terminology for higher categories, or even a couple of new systems
of terminology.  But as an outsider with some curiosity, I have the
impression that as of this time I'd need to learn quite few systems to
get much into the field.  That can happen, or course, but I am glad to
see people taking these choices of words seriously.

best, Colin
