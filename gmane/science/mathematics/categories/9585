Workshop Domains XIII  CALL FOR ABSTRACTS
https://andrejbauer.github.io/domains-floc-2018/

Date: 7-8 July

Fifty years of domain theory

  Fifty years ago, Dana Scott introduced domain theory for the
  purposes of denotational semantics of programming languages when he
  was in Oxford, where he worked with Christopher Strachey. This work
  has had a vast and lasting impact on logic, computer science, and
  mathematics. As part of the Workshop DOMAINS'2018, which will take
  place in Oxford on 7-8 July 2018, we will celebrate 50 years of
  domain theory and Dana Scott's 85th birthday. The event is
  affiliated with the Federated Logic Conference 2018 and LICS.

We will also commemorate Klaus Keimel, the founder of the workshop
Domains series.

About the Domains Workshop series

  The applications of domain theory include programming logics (LCF),
  design of programming languages, models of the lambda calculus,
  applications to recursion theory (higher-type computability,
  Kleene-Kreisel countable functionals), general topology (injective
  spaces, function spaces, locally compact spaces, Stone duality),
  topological algebra (Lawson semilattices) and analysis (measure,
  integration, dynamical systems). Moreover, these applications are
  related - for example, Stone duality has given rise to a logic of
  observable properties of computational processes.

  The Domains workshop series is aimed at computer scientists and
  mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
  foundations of computation. The workshop series focuses on domains,
  their applications in mathematics and computer science, and related
  topics. Previous meetings were held in Darmstadt (1994, 1999, 2004),
  Braunschweig (1996), Munich (1997), Siegen (1998), Birmingham
  (2002), Novosibirsk (2007), Brighton (2008), Swansea (2011), Paris
  (2014), and Cork (2015).

Topics of interaction with domain theory for this workshop include,
but are not limited to

  - program semantics
  - program logics
  - probabilistic computation
  - exact computation over the real numbers
  - lambda calculus
  - games
  - models of sequential computation
  - constructive mathematics
  - recursion theory
  - realizability
  - real analysis and computability
  - topology, metric spaces and domains
  - idempotent analysis and domains
