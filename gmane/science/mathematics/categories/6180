Yes, fibrations in the original sense of Grothendieck are "evil"
(sorry, Jean!), as is shown by the fact that an equivalence of
categories is not in general a fibration. There is a weaker notion
of fibration in which one replaces the equality "P\phi = u" by a
(specified) isomorphism PY -> J making the obvious triangle
commute. But every fibration in this sense factors as an equivalence
followed by a fibration in Grothendieck's sense, so it's not
such an important notion.
