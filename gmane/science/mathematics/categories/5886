               CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

================================================================

GAMES is the annual workshop of the ESF Network on Games for Design and
Verification. This year's GAMES workshop will be held at St. Anne's
College Oxford. More information about the games workshop can be found at
http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/games2010.


SCOPE:
The scope of the workshop includes the mathematical and algorithmic analysis of
finite and infinite games, the interplay of games with automata theory and
logic, and applications of games, automata, and logic to the design and
verification of computing systems.


PROGRAMME: As in previous years, GAMES 2010 will be an informal workshop,
without proceedings. Its programme consists of six invited tutorials,
contributed talks (30 min) and short presentations (15 min). Contributed talks
and short presentations will be selected by the programme committee on the
basis of submitted abstracts.  These can include work already submitted to
other conferences. GAMES 2010 will also feature an open problem session, which
will consist of very short (10 min) descriptions of interesting open problems
about games.


INVITED TUTORIALS:
- Roderick Bloem   (TU Graz, Austria)
- Thomas Colcombet (Liafa, Paris 7, France)
- Fedor Fomin (Bergen, Norway)
- Paul Goldberg (Liverpool, UK)
- Tristan Tomala  (HEC, Paris, France)
- Wieslaw Zielonka (Liafa, Paris 7, France)


SUBMISSIONS:
Researchers who would like to present a talk at GAMES 2010 are invited to
submit an extended abstract of up to two pages by email to
games2010@comlab.ox.ac.uk by 1st July 2010. Decisions about acceptance will be
made by 1st August 2010.


IMPORTANT DATES
Paper submission:    1st July 2010
Author notification: 1st August 2010
Workshop:            20-23 September 2010
