I thought the point of the Lawson topology was to show the opposite:
that the benefits of the Scott topology could be had without having to
broaden topology beyond Hausdorff.

But if one were to so broaden it, wouldn't it be more natural to do so a
la Nachbin and Priestly, with topologized posets?

But if you really like the traditional notion of a topological space in
all its generality, why insist on the closure conditions on open sets
when we know that dropping them gives a category with reasonable
properties, namely extensional Chu(Set,2), further improved to a very
nice category by dropping extensionality, and generalizable to
Chu(Set,K) and yet further to Chu(V,k)?
