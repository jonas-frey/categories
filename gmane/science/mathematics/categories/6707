Something in Wikipedia on E.-M. spaces I think they've got not quite righ=
t.
The article in question: =


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilenberg%E2%80%93MacLane_space .

The problem: after stating (more or less correctly) that "An important =

property of K(G,n) is that, for any abelian group G, and any CW-complex X=
, =

the set

     [X, K(G,n)]

of homotopy classes of maps from X to K(G,n) is in natural bijection with=
  =

the n-th singular cohomology group

     H^n(X; G)"

the article goes on to say (incorrectly) that "Since H^n(K(G,n); G) =3D =

Hom(G,G), there is a distinguished element u {\in} H^n(K(G,n);G) =

corresponding to the identity."

Seems to me all that's justified here would be that 'the set

     [K(G,n), K(G,n)]

of homotopy classes of maps from K(G,n) to itself is in natural bijection=
  =

with H^n(K(G,n); G)', whence "there is a distinguished element u {\in} =

H^n(K(G,n);G) corresponding to the identity."

What exact role Hom(G,G) may have to play here might be of interest in it=
s =

own right, but there's no groundwork for that laid anywhere in this Wiki =

article, and it's not germane to the Yoneda lemma instance being invoked.=


Or am I missing something?

In any event, I haven't the optimism or the enthusiasm to care to try =

to revise this Wiki's text -- but I welcome any reader who has to do so.

Cheers, -- Fred
