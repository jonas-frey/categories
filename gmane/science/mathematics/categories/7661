                            FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT



                                                                   * * *



      Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop that brings together researchers in theoretical computer science and category theory, and in the past has met in Halifax, Ottawa, Calgary, Vancouver, Spokane, and Portland. It has been the source for fruitful collaboration and presentation of results related to these areas. Recent workshops have had discussions on areas such as quantum programming languages, restriction categories,  database design, and the differential and resource lambda-calculi.  This year's meeting will be hosted in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Mount Allison University in Sackville, Canada.


     There will be an informal welcoming reception in the evening of May 
31st, starting at 5:30. The scientific program starts on June 1st, and 
consists of tutorials, invited talks, and contributed talks. There will be 
an excursion on one of the afternoons. The meeting ends on the afternoon 
of June 3rd.  Participants may wish to note that the summer CMS meeting 
begins the following day in Halifax (a 2 hour drive from Sackville) with a 
special session on higher categories.

     Invited speakers are Joachim Kock (Barcelona), Ernie Manes 
(Massachusetts), Eugenio Moggi (Genoa) and Michael Shulman (Institute for 
Advanced Study).

     The organizing committee is Robin Cockett, Geoff Cruttwell (local 
organizer), Phil Mulry, John Macdonald, Dorette Pronk, and Bob Rosebrugh 
(local organizer).
