On a given data=2C a structure is additional data on it that=2C if it exist=

Precisely=2C it comes down to what definition of covering space one adopts.=
  If the general definition is adopted then=2C even in the locally connected=
  case=2C it is a structure=2C as any two trivialization structures given by=
  U=2C V=2C need not be isomorphic except on a connected W contained in the =
intersection. If=2C on the other hand=2C the specifi definition is adopted=
=2C where canonical neighborhoods (U open=2C connected=2C and each connecte=
d component of the inverse image of U under p in X is mapped homeomorphical=
ly onto U) are given as part of the structure=2C then the structure is a pr=
operty.=A0
>=A0
I think that I have nothing else to say on his matter.
