Dear Bill and Colleagues,=20

In reply here only to Bill (4), but great interest in the other =
comments, I entirely agree with the many pointed approach, which was =
published in my 1967 Proc LMS article. This is  relevant also to higher =
homotopy theory. If you define \pi_n(X,P) where P is now a *set* of base =
points, then you see this has to have the structure of module over =
\pi_1(X,P). As an example of its use, consider the map=20

                  S^n \vee [0,1] \to S^n \vee S^1

which identifies 0 and 1, where the S^n is stuck to [0,1] at 0.  Clearly =
\pi_n of the first space on the set of base points P consisting of 0 and =
1 is the free module on one generator over the indiscrete groupoid =
\I=3D\pi_1([0,1],P). The main theorem of Higgins and RB implies that =
\pi_n of the second space at 0 is the free module on one generator over =
the infinite cyclic group, which itself is obtained from \I by =
identifying 0 and 1 in the category of groupoids.=20

I know this result can also be obtained using covering space arguments =
and homology, but I got into groupoids by trying to avoid this detour to =
covering spaces  to describe the fundamental group of S^1. It is a =
question of finding algebra which  models geometry.=20

One of my joint papers, which calculated (using vKT for crossed modules) =
some  \pi_2(X,x)  as a module,  was rejected by one journal on the =
grounds that the calculations were too elaborate when `the interest is =
in the group and not the module'. So much for homological algebra!=20
There is a culture in algebraic topology which neglects the operations =
of \pi_1;  perhaps it seems an encumbrance when there is only one base =
point, but Henry Whitehead commented in 1957 that the operations =
fascinated the early workers in homotopy theory.=20

It is amusing to speculate what might be infinite loop space theory, or =
little cube operads, if you allow many base points! Could it clear up =
the subjects??!! Answers on a postcard please (joke).=20

A standard lesson in mathematics is that you should forget structure at =
the latest possible moment. In homotopy theory low dimensional =
identifications can and usually do affect higher dimensional homotopy =
invariants. To try and cope with this, we need homotopical functors =
which carry algebraic information in a range of dimensions, to model how =
spaces are glued together. This has been the aim of the various Higher =
Homotopy van Kampen theorems. To handle these algebraic structures one =
needs category theory ; as one example,  I am currently working on a =
joint paper using fibred and cofibred categories to relate high and low =
dimensional information on colimits and induced structures. =20

The hope also is that because of the wide interest in deformation, i.e. =
homotopy,  as a means of classification, these tools and methods will =
have wider implications.=20

Dear Ronnie and Colleagues,

Your comments are extremely interesting.  Thank you very much for =
raising=20
in so striking a manner the question of the relation between general=20
monoidal structures and cartesian closed structures.
Below are some observations which show, I think,
that everybody should be interested in this relation because it is=20
manyfold and fruitful.

(1)    While cartesian closed structures have the virtue of being =
unique,=20
general monoidal closed structures have the virtue of not being unique.=20
Thus, for example, the cartesian closed presheaf toposes (with their=20
exactness properties and combinatorial truth object) often have a =
further=20
monoidal closed structure given by Brian Day's convolution with respect =
to=20
a pro-co-monoidal structure on the site. Cubical as well as simplicial=20
sets have both cartesian and non-cartesian closed structures, and that =
is=20
'true', not merely 'convenient'.

(2)    Another category having both cartesian and non-cartesian monoidal =

structures is the real interval from zero to infinity with 'x dominates =
y'=20
as the morphism from x to y. (Actually, this category is derived by=20
collapsing a natural topos of dynamical systems in 'Taking categories=20
seriously' TAC Reprints.) Categories enriched with respect to the=20
non-cartesian structure here (see 'Metric Spaces' TAC reprints) arise=20
every day in analysis and the rich insights of enrichment theory =
(Functor=20
categories, bi-module composition, free categories, etcetera) should be=20
systematically applied to the advance of analysis and geometry, while on =

the other hand metric examples inspire further developments of =
enrichment=20
theory. Cauchy (who never worked on idempotent splitting in ordinary=20
categories and additive categories in the way that Freyd and Karoubi =
did)=20
does not deserve to have his name brandished as a joke to scare one's=20
uncomprehending colleagues in analysis. The kind of completeness that is =

inspired by two-sided intervals (unlike the one-sided intervals=20
inaccurately alluded to in common discussions of 'density') indeed =
reduces=20
to the one attributed to Cauchy in the particular example of Metric=20
Spaces. The author hoped that observation would contribute to the =
advance=20
of analysis and the development of enrichment theory, not to the supply =
of=20
buzzwords.

    In fact, there is an insufficiently known branch of analysis called=20
'Idempotent Analysis', which deals largely with composition of =
bi-modules,=20
or more precisely, with the relation between the two closed structures =
on=20
the infinite interval. Of course, that monoidal category is isomorphic =
to=20
the unit interval under multiplication (still cartesian closed too) =
which=20
induces many of the relations between probablility and entropy.

(3)    Perhaps the most common relation between non-cartesian monoidal=20
categories and cartesian categories arises when a structure such as =
vector=20
space is interpreted in a cohesive background. I am sticking to my story =

that cohesive backgrounds are basically cartesian closed, due to the=20
ubiquitous role of diagonal maps and also due to the fact that, for=20
example, bornological vector spaces have an obvious monoidal closed=20
structure, whereas topological vector spaces have none. The rumor that=20
topological vector spaces might have a tensor with an adjoint hom is =
part=20
of the disinformation that makes functional analysis look more difficult =

than it is. A more accurate account of the relation between non-Mackey=20
convergence and closed structure can be found in C. Houzel's paper on=20
Grauert finiteness, Mathematische Annalen, vol. 205, 1973, 13-54:
essentially, the topological categories are merely enriched in the=20
genuinely monoidal closed bornological ones. Similarly, the idea that =
not=20
all dual spaces are complete seems to be based on a misguided generality =

in the notion of Cauchy nets (they should be bounded).

(4)    Although pointed spaces are somewhat entrenched in algebraic=20
topology, there is an improvement suggested by your own work, Ronnie.=20
Consider the category whose objects are arrows S ---> E where E is a =
space=20
(object of a cartesian closed cohesive background category) and S is a=20
discrete space. This category is even a topos if the category of E's =
was,=20
as is the larger category of arrows between general pairs of spaces. The =

first category is actually an adjoint retract of the second, correcting=20
the discontinuity that arises from the traditional limitation S =3D 1.=20
Intuitively, in the case where the pair of spaces is a subspace =
inclusion,=20
the adjoint collapses the subspace to a point if the subspace is=20
connected, but if it is not connected, does not artificially merge its=20
components. There are many applications of this corrected construction =
of=20
the space which results from 'neglecting' a subspace, both in algebraic=20
topology and in functional analysis, too numerous to discuss here.

Bill
