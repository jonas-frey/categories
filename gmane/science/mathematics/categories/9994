(On the subject of "letting go of the strict domain-codomain discipline"...=
)

In my work with Kevin Walker (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5025,
particularly the disklike n-categories of \S 6) we talk about
n-categories for which notions of input and output are solely "in the
eye of the beholder", and argue that this is a convenient and natural
language for the role of categories in TFT.

As an application of this, in a very recent paper with Kevin and Paul
Wedrich, https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12194, we give what is arguably
the "first interesting example" of a 4-category, built out of Khovanov
homology. Formalising this gadget as a disklike 4-category, we can say
enough to produce invariants of oriented 4-manifolds. Attempting
instead to formalise this gadget as a "conventional" "domain-codomain"
4-category, we were much less satisfied --- we can check the axioms
for a braided monoidal 2-category, but after that it's not
particularly clear which duality properties one would need to check
(in Lurie's language, perhaps this is working out what an SO(4)-fixed
point structure actually is?) in order to continue on to building
4-manifold invariants.

best regards,
Scott
