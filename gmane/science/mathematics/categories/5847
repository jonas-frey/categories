Dear Bj=F6rn,

In my recent preprint "Not every pseudoalgebra is equivalent to a
strict one" (arXiv:1005.1520), I had occasion to consider pseudo
V-categories, pseudo V-functors, and V-icons for such a V -- these
form the 2-category Ps-T-Alg for a suitable 2-monad on the 2-category
of V-enriched graphs.  Obviously lax T-morphisms will similarly be lax
V-functors.  I didn't have any need for general V-transformations or
modifications, and they don't fall as naturally out of the 2-monad
setup, but I agree that the definitions are easy to write down.  I
would also be interested to hear who may have studied these notions in
general.

Best,
Mike
