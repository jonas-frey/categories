The following may be of interest to readers of this list:

Carsten F=FChrmann and David Pym,
''On the Geometry of Interaction for Classical Logic''.

Abstract. It is well-known that weakening and contraction cause na=EFve
categorical models of the classical sequent calculus to collapse to
Boolean lattices. In a previous paper, summarized herein, we provided
sound and complete models that avoid this collapse by interpreting
cut-reduction by a partial order between morphisms. In this article, we
provide concrete examples of such models, based on geometry of
interaction and data-flow. Our models provide detailed analyses of the
relationships between negation, weakening, and contraction under
cut-reduction.

We'd be very pleased to receive comments. This paper follows on from

Carsten F=FChrmann and David Pym,
"Order-enriched Categorical Models of the Classical Sequent Calculus".

Abstract. It is well-known that weakening and contraction cause na=EFve
categorical models of the classical sequent calculus to collapse to
Boolean lattices. Starting from a convenient formulation of the
well-known categorical semantics of linear classical sequent proofs, we
give models of weakening and contraction that do not collapse.
Cut-reduction is interpreted by a partial order between morphisms. Our
models make no commitment to any translation of classical logic into
intuitionistic logic and distinguish non-deterministic choices of
cut-elimination. We show soundness and completeness via initial models
built from proof nets, and describe models built from sets and relations.

This paper is in submission. Manscript available at

Again, we'd be very pleased to receive comments.

Regards,

    David
