This is precisely where the construction falls down for a non-semilocally
1-connected space. If we restrict to looking at the automorphisms as a point
(which supposedly form a topological group) the multiplication in the group
pi_1 x pi_1 -> pi_1 (i.e. concatenating equivalence classes of loops) is not
continuous in both variables, even though it is separately continuous (*).
This can be traced back to the simple fact that the product of a pair of
quotient maps in Top is not necessarily a quotient map. Note that this is
the usual product in Top, not the compactly generated product. I presume
there is a similar hitch with locales?

(*) I learned of the non-continuity of the multiplication map from, among
other places, the article

J. Brazas, The topological fundamental group and hoop earring spaces, 2009,
arXiv:0910.3685

which dashes optimistic earlier constructions.


Going back to more general thoughts, given an arbitrary space X, the topos
Sh(X) is the classifying topos of some localic groupoid G_X (Joyal-Tierney),
which I thought (!) could be interpreted as the fundamental groupoid in nice
situations. Here I suppose is my real question: what relation is there
between G_X and the (ordinary) fundamental groupoid Pi_1(X)? I suppose a
test case could be the Warsaw circle W: Pi_1(W) is equivalent to the
discrete groupoid on the set {a,b}, and surely G_W is more than this.

One last question: has anyone studied the relation between (strong) shape of
a space X and this localic groupoid G_X?
