Thanks Peter, and now Walter too, for this list - there cannot be a lot of =
entries still to add, but there's one I'd like to see. =20

I was going to add mention myself of the S=C3=A9minaire de Math=C3=A9matiqu=
es Sup=C3=A9rieures (Universit=C3=A9 de Montr=C3=A9al) meeting in spring-ea=
rly summer 1974, entitled "M=C3=A9thodes cat=C3=A9goriques en logique math=
=C3=A9matique et en th=C3=A9orie des automates", under the nominal directio=
n of S. Takahashi.  At this meeting important series of talks (virtually su=
mmer-school-type introductions, combined with state-or-the-art research tal=
ks) by Benabou, Joyal, Freyd, Reyes, and many others, made this meeting gro=
und-breaking I think - one might regard it as the "coming of age" of the ma=
rriage of logic and categories begun by Bill Lawvere (who I am pretty sure =
was there too, but my memory is poor after all this time!) less than a deca=
de earlier.  (Much as the Boulder meeting was often regarded in a similar l=
ight for the connections between categories and computer science.)

But sadly, I cannot give the exact dates (May or June '74?) for that meetin=
g.  I kept a student's diary at the time, but seem to have lost it, so have=
  no records myself to base this information on.  Surely someone can help wi=
th this?

Thanks, Peter, for compiling this list, this is great!

There were also "Kategorien" meetings at Oberwolfach in 1972 and 1973,
organized by John Gray and Horst Schubert, which were probably
instrumental in establishing the tradition of summer conferences in
category theory:

Oberwolfach, 23-29 July, 1972,
Oberwolfach, 22-28 July, 1973.

When leafing through the Oberwolfach archives (to recall the dates
above), to my surprise, I saw that there was also a summer conference
on "Kategorien und Funktoren" in 1966, organized by Albrecht Dold and
Saunders Mac Lane(!):

Oberwolfach, 17-23 July, 1966.

This was just one year after the 1965 La Jolla meeting, probably to be
considered the first major international conference on category theory
ever. In Aveiro (CT2015) we acknowledged the 50th anniversary of that
pivotal conference.

With the help of all readers of the list (and perhaps by leafing
through old Springer Lecture Notes), it should be possible to close the
information gap in the open interval (1966,1972).
