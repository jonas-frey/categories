*Tracks and Special Sessions*
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Besides the main track, ICLP 2020 will host additional tracks and=20
special sessions:*
*_Applications Track:_This track invites submissions of papers on=20
emerging and deployed applications of LP, describing all aspects of the=20
development, deployment, and evaluation of logic programming systems to=20
solve real-world problems, including interesting case studies and=20
benchmarks, and discussing lessons learned.*
*_Sister Conferences and Journal Presentation Track__:_ This track=20
provides a forum to discuss important results related to logic=20
programming that appeared recently (from January 2017 onwards) in=20
selective journals and conferences but have not been previously=20
presented at ICLP.*
*_Special Session: Women in Logic Programming__:_ This special session=20
will include invited talks and presentations by women in logic=20
programming.**
**_Research Challenges in Logic Programming Track:_**This track invites=20
submissions of papers describing research challenges that an individual=20
researcher or a research group is currently attacking. The goal of the=20
track is to promote discussions, exchange of ideas, and possibly=20
stimulate new collaborations. Papers submitted to this track do not go=20
through the usual review and will not be published in the proceedings =E2=
=80=93=20
they will be distributed at the conference as a technical report.

Every of the above four tracks will have its own dedicated chairs, PC,=20
evaluationcriteria, and CFP with related submission details (see the=20
specific call for papers). In addition to the presentations of accepted=20
papers, the technical program willinclude invited talks, advanced=20
tutorials, the doctoral consortium, and severalworkshops.

*Submission Details*
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
All submissions must be made via the EasyChair conference=20
system:https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Diclp20200=20
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Diclp20200>. Regular papers must=
=20
be in the condensed TPLP format (template here) and not exceed14 pages=20
including bibliography. Regular papers may be supplemented with=20
appendices for proofs and details of datasets which do not count towards=20
the page limit andwhich will not be made available as appendices to the=20
published paper.

Three kinds of regular papers will be accepted:
=E2=80=A2 Technical papers for technically sound, innovative ideas that can=
=20
advance thestate of logic programming;
=E2=80=A2 Application papers that impact interesting application domains;
=E2=80=A2 System and tool papers which emphasize novelty, practicality,=20
usability, and availability of the systems and tools described.=20
Application, system, and tool papers need to be clearly marked in their=20
title.

All submissions must be written in English and describe original,=20
previouslyunpublished research, and must not simultaneously be submitted=20
for publication elsewhere. These restrictions do not apply to previously=20
accepted workshop papers with a limited audience and/or without archival=20
proceedings.

Papers of the highest quality will be selected to be published in the=20
journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Cambridge=20
University Press (CUP). In order to ensure the quality of the final=20
version, papers may be subject to more than one round of refereeing=20
(within the decision period).

The program committee may recommend some regular papers to be published=20
as Technical communications in EPTCS format (http://info.eptcs.org=20
<http://info.eptcs.org/>). Technical communications must not exceed 14=20
pages, including the bibliography. The authors of the technical=20
communications can also elect to convert their submissions into extended=20
abstracts, of 2 or 3 pages, for inclusion in the EPTCS proceedings. This=20
should allow authors to submit a long version elsewhere.

All regular papers and technical communications will be presented during=20
theconference. So, at least one author per accepted paper is expected to=20
register andattend the conference. Authors of accepted papers will, by=20
default, be automatically included in the list of ALP members, who will=20
receive quarterly updates from theLogic Programming Newsletter at no cost.

details. For information,please visit the DC Web Page.

*Workshops*
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
