		 LECTURER IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE

Applications are invited for a permanent lectureship in Theoretical
Computer Science in the School of Computer Science at the University of
Birmingham. 

Applications from all areas of Theoretical Computer Science will be
considered but preferential treatment will be given to candidates who
show promise to strengthen existing activities. These encompass
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, Lambda Calculus, Type
Theory, and Verification of Systems. The School has recently appointed
Uday Reddy to a Chair in Programming Languages and close cooperation
between the existing Theory group and this new strand of activity is
expected.

Please pass this advert on to any interested individuals in your
department.

Kind regards,

Achim Jung.
