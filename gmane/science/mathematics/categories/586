The category with objects  <A, f:FA->GA> and evident maps is sometimes 
called an inserter.  It is a weighted limit - a sort of "lax equalizer" 
of the two functors F and G: it may be written as F//G to distinguish 
it from the comma category (which is written F/G).  

It is used in the construction of datatypes (Hagino's thesis - as 
mentioned earlier - see also Dwight Spencer and my paper "Strong 
categorical datatypes II" TCS 139 (1995) 69-113 and its predecessor).
Furthermore, one can express the parametricity properties of combinators 
and modules using these categories (see Peter Vesely's MSc thesis on the 
Charity site (http:/www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/projects/charity/home.html) 
and Maarten Fokkinga's thesis - and paper in a recent MSCS issue - where 
I believe he uses the term "transformer" rather than combinator).

I recently gave a working presentation to IFIP 2.1 entitled a "A reminder 
on inserters" ... this because I felt the connection to datatypes and the 
software structuring and parametricity ramifications of this seemingly 
innocuous limit had still not been sufficiently recognized or exploited.
