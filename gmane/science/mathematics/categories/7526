Others have expressed well many of the sentiments I also feel.
Aurelio and Patrizia were very kind to us. Our family loved travelling
in his big Citroen and stopping off for delicious gelati on the way home
from school.

We were a bit worried once, taking Aurelio to an Italian restaurant at
Bondi Beach (Papa Giovanni's). Could be a disaster. We were served
our pizzas and were hoeing in. We noticed some mild activity with
Aurelio's hands involving putting his finger to his cheek and other things.
Then Aurelio stood up. We asked where he was going. He said the chef
had invited him to taste the spaghetti he himself was eating
at another table. Not a word had been spoken.

So many memories, personal and mathematical.

Ross
