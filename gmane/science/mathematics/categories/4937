Hello categorists

=20

As a small project many months ago i started http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T=
imeline_of_category_theory_and_related_mathematics.

Not only because there was none but to write a little piece of what i have =
learned so others can benefit from it. In fact i often look in it for detai=
ls. Since i am not a real expert in category theory (which is huge!) yet=2C=
 could you see if there are errors=2C inaccuracies=2C bad explanation or wo=
rding etc.? It is so sad when you get wrong facts from wikipedia. Just edit=
=2C no e-mails needed.
Additions are just as good :)

At the time there was no nLab. If there was i would maby have written it th=
ere. If you want

and there is a need to i could start transfering the timeline to nLab. I th=
ink you like more

to edit nLab than wikipedia.

Best Regards
