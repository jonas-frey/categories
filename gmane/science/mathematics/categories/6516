I've just noticed there was a bit more to your question:

I assume you would now want an identity at each object for each
composition. Then exactly the same argument as in my last email shows that
structures like this can be analysed in terms of categories C with a
designated family of (assignments to each object a of C of an invertible
endomorphism of a).

PS There's a small typo in my last email. Replace `s_i' by `e_i'.
