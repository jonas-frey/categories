Dear category theorists,

Vladimir Guletskii was asking me to post to the category list the links
about a Ph.D. scholarship in Liverpool, England on the interface of the
theory of motives in algebraic geometry with the study of (stable) model
categories (typically with tensor product).

y-theory


  One might also want to compare ideas about noncommutative motives which
are, according to Volodya, also relevant.

He adds a remark:

     There is some difference between the overseas fees and the home fees,
but (a) citizens of EU do not have to pay it, and (b) our department here
can sort out the difference between fees anyway.

Volodya also calls our attention to the closeness of some relevant content
to the ideas in John Baez's presentation on the zeta-function

Please forward this to the possibly interested students.
