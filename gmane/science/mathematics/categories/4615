Let me add my two cents :)

We can think of two definitions of math. The first is based on the
subject matter ("what"): math is the study of Bourbaki's structures.
The other is based on "how:"  math is the study of structures in a
well-structured way. With this definition, a good computer programmer
or, say, Henry Ford, who applied conveyor to assembling, are more
mathematicians than some of the guys responsible for what Vaughan
wrote about.

If we imagine a two dimensional plane with the "what" axis being
vertical and the "how" horizontal, then we get two mathematics and
resp. two sorts of mathematicians: vertical and horizontal. (CT and
CT-rists go, of course, along the harmonized diagonal :).
Historically, Bourbaki put a bold point on the line of
Euclid-Peano-Hilbert and indeed formed the vertical dimension of the
modern mathematical space.  However, while the very texts written by
Bourbaki are mostly enjoyable, his epigones have created a special
literary style, which is good for writing/producing but hardly for
reading mathematical papers.  Bourbaki should not be blamed for wide
dissemination of this indigestible style but...Vladimir Arnold once
said that  "bourbakization" of modern mathematics should perhaps be
called "oBourbachivanie" in Russian (which rhymes with the Russian
"oDourachivanie", which refers to fooling with someone :).

Dinosaurs would not normally die off themselves. Some causes are
needed, and here's one  (somewhat speculative though). CT can change
the very notion of what a formal definition is. In the modern style,
the notion of ordered pair/tuple and its derivatives like formula and
term are central.  This quite simple syntax (as is often happens with
simple syntax, think, for example, of a Java program)  can hide
complex structures so that a tuple-based formal definition is not
actually formal and implicitly involves intuitive concepts. If CT will
sometime indeed reshape the criteria of being a formal specification
(of a Bourbaki's structure), then dinosaurs would be forced to acquire
CT (or die off).
