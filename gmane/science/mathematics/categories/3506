Dear colleagues,

I happened to know now of a strange, seemingly incredible, connection =20=

between the Elsevier publishing company and arms fairs.

There is a dedicated web page:

http://cage.ugent.be/~npg/elsevier/index.html

Quoting from the beginning:

"  Background on Elsevier and the arms trade

If you are an academic then you may well know the publishing house =20
Reed-Elsevier as a publisher of your papers. What you may not know is =20=

that they also have a sideline organising arms fairs. Through its =20
subsidiary companies, Reed Exhibitions and Spearhead Exhibitions, =20
Reed Elsevier is responsible for organising major arms fairs in =20
several countries across the world, as well as here in the UK.
The majority of Reed's work is in providing information services and =20
publications for a wide variety of professional groups whose work is =20
in the public interest. Consequently it is surprising that they would =20=

want to muddy their good work by involvement in the arms trade. It =20
also means that they have received significant criticism from =20
professional groups who use their more legitimate services.  "  (end =20
of citation.)

More information can be found on other links of the previous page. =20
For instance:

or reading the following letter from "Timesonline" (March 1, 2006), =20
signed also by JM Coetzee, a Nobel prize winner:

The replies I have seen to all that seem to be of the following kind:

[from the "Timesonline" article cited above] "Reed Exhibitions have =20
publicly insisted that =93the defence industry is central to the =20
preservation of freedom and national security=94.   (end of citation.)

I think that all scientists are concerned, in particular our group.

With kind regards

Marco Grandis
