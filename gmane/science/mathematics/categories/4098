Ah, but if a Heyting algebra is complete, then so is the Boolean algebra
of all not-not-stable elements.  Familiar example: the regular open
subsets of a topological space form a complete Boolean algebra.

As remarked, the Sub(1) of the free topos with nno is not atomic, and with
reference again to Godel's theorem via the not-not translation, the
Boolean algebra of not-not-stable elements is also non atomic.  But all
countable, non-atomic Boolean algebras are isomorphic to the clopen
subsets of the Cantor space (or the Lindenbaum algebra of classical
propositional calculus, or the free Boolean algebra on countably many
generators).  That algebra is not complete -- as can be seen in many ways.
Q.E.D.
