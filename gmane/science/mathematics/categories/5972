Dear Paul et al:

 	I certainly learned about non-Hausdorff topologies in the topology
course I took as an undergraduate from Michael Edelstein at Dalhousie
(using Kelley's "General Topology" as a text).  The Zariski topology
also appeared in a couple courses, and various instructors recommended
the book "Counterexamples in Topology" by Steen and Seebach, which gives
a fairly good "tour of the zoo".

 	Nonetheless, thirty year later, I would certainly accept that a modern
treatment of the topic would have a somewhat different focus, for
precisely the reasons that you give in your first paragraph.

 	-Robert
