Of course sketches are mathematical objects in their own right.  Of
course, the functor that assigns to each sketch the corresponding theory
is not full or faithful.  But the definition is precise, the notion of
model is also precise, so I have no idea what, if any, content there is in
the claim.  Incidentally, you might with equal justice claim that triples
are not mathematical objects since two distinct triples can have
isomorphic categories of Eilenberg-Moore algebras.  In fact there are
triples (or theories) on Set that have infinitary operations, yet whose
category of models is isomorphic to Set.
