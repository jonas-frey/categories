Dear Richard,

I am sorry, but, unless I completely misunderstood what you are saying, what
you call "(2)" is simply wrong. Moreover, this can be seen in the 'very
first" example of Galois theory. For, take:

(a) C to be the category of G-sets, where G is any fixed non-trivial group;

(b) X to be the category of sets;

(c) I -| H to be what you called "pi_0 -| Delta" in your first message (that
is, for A in C, I(A) is the set of orbits of A, while for S in X, H(S) is
the set S equipped with the trivial action of G);

(d) B = 1, the one-element G-set;

(e) E = G, considered as a G-set, on which G acts via its multiplication.

Then C / E is equivalent to the category of sets, and in particular each of
its objects is a coproduct of copies of its terminal object G=G; and let us
calculate your monad, which is sufficient to do for G=G:

(g) Your C / E --Sum_p--> C / B sends G=G to G-->1;

(h) Then I^B sends G-->1 to 1=1, the terminal object of X / I(B) = X / 1;

(i) H^B and p^* preserves the terminal object;

(j) that is, your monad sends G=G to G=G, and so it is the identity monad.

But the right monad is the free G-set monad (if we identify C / E with the
category of sets).

Please either confirm or explain what have I misunderstood in your message.

George
