REGULAR REGISTRATION CLOSES on 25th June 2018.

The seventh Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'18) will be held in
Oxford, UK, in July 2018, at the Mathematical Institute and the
Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford. In addition
to nine major international conferences related to mathematical logic
and computer science, FLoC 2018 will feature 79 workshops arranged
in three segments:

Pre-FLoC: Sat 7 - Sun 8 (workshops related to CSF, FSCD, ITP, LICS and SAT),
Mid-FLoC: Wed 11 - Sat 14 (workshops related to CAV, ICLP, IJCAR, ITP and
LICS),
Post-FLoC: Wed 18 - Thu 19 (workshops related to FM, CAV, ICLP and IJCAR).

REGULAR REGISTRATION CLOSES on 25th June 2018.
ON SITE REGISTRATION will be possible during the conference.
