What most impressed my students and me two decades ago, when we were
applying the concepts of EK65 to modeling concurrency, was their attempt
to define "closed" as a self-contained notion independently of any
tensor product as its left adjoint (or so it seemed to us).  This
defeated us.  Has a clearer story of that attempt, or any related story,
emerged in the meantime?

Hopefully not.  If affine geometry has no origin, why should locally
cartesian closed categories have a global reference point?  (What would
Andy Pitts have decided there, and for that matter the orientation of
profunctors in B2.7, which seems backwards from say Borceux?)
