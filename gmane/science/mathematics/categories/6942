I recently reported that

=2E.. surprisingly little. Early, early this morning I tried that again,
but enclosing the search string in double-quotation marks. Ah, now I
found two other references, worth citing, perhaps:

1) Volker Runde's 2005 Springer Universitext, isbn=3D038725790X, =

A Taste of Topology, includes a passage (page 72), beginning =


"Let (X,TX) be a chaotic topological space (ie, TX =3D {=E2=88=85,X}), =

let (Y,TY) be a Hausdorff space, and let f: X =E2=86=92 Y be continuous"
  =

and deducing such f must be constant; links (to Google Books and a PDF):

ftp://210.45.114.81/math/2007_07_06/Universitext/V.Runde%20A%20Taste%20of=
%20Topology.pdf


(no hint, though, how 'standard' Runde thought his use of "chaotic" here =
was
:-{ ); and

2) Mat{=C2=B4=C4=B1}as Menni's 2000 Edinburgh PhD thesis {Exact Completio=
ns and
Toposes} makes
multiple mention of chaotic structures, with frequent citations of Bill
Lawvere's =

interest in such things. All of Chapter 7 is about "Chaotic Situations", =
with
Section =

7.1 focused in particular on "Chaotic Objects"; and Section 8.4 returns t=
o
"Chaotic Situations". A hint of the flavor is given in the Introduction
already:

"In 1999, Longley introduced a typed version of the notion of a partial =

combinatory algebra in [68] and described how to build a category of
assemblies =

Ass(A) over a [sic] such a structure A. Shortly after, Lietz and Streiche=
r
showed =

that the ex/reg completion of Ass(A) is a topos if and only if the typed
structure =

A is equivalent, in a suitable sense, to an untyped structure. Their proo=
f
uses =

the notion of a generic mono (a mono =CF=84 such that every other mono ar=
ises as a

pullback of =CF=84 along a not necessarily unique map) and of the constan=
t-objects

embedding of Set into the category Ass(A) which they see as an inclusion =
of =

codiscrete objects. Related to this, it should be mentioned that Lawvere =
had =

already advocated for a conceptual use of codiscrete or chaotic objects i=
n =

other areas of mathematics (see for example [59, 55, 61, 63])."

No surprise, then, to see the right adjoint =E2=88=87 to the forgetful fu=
nctor Set
-> Top
described (p. 23) as follows: " ... the functor =E2=88=87: Set -> Top ass=
igns to
each set =

S the =E2=80=9Cchaotic=E2=80=9D topological space with underlying set S a=
nd, as open sets,

only S itself and the empty set."

All told, eight hits, all either these two, or references to them, or
search-database errors :-) . Not very heavy evidence in favor of "chaotic=
".

So: cheers -- and back to [co-|in-]discrete, I fear :-) , -- Fred =
