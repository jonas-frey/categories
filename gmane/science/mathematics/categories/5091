It might be worthwhile merging this effort with that at the nLab wiki.
It seems to me that this has by now entries on most or all of the
planned entries at the wikibook -- and more. Maybe one should transfer
material as needed.

To get an impression for the entries that do and those that do not yet
exist on the nLab see the link lists at

  [[category theory]] http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory

  [[Categories and Sheaves]] http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Categories+and+Sh=
eaves

  [[Sheaves in Geometry and Logic]]
http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Sheaves+in+Geometry+and+Logic

There is more, not indexed yet. On the other hand, of course all this
is incomplete and still in the making, too.

Please feel free and feel encouraged to add to the nLab.
