Dear all,

Considering the well known fact that an equivalence relation R on a
set S gives a groupoid S_R with object set S, and the quotient of S
by R is pi_0(S_R), has anyone done any work on "equivalence
relations" on categories?

Taking the skeleton of a cat is the prototypical example, but what I
had in mind was a more "relative" construction. Given a groupoid
enriched in categories, taking a sort of Pi_1 would give us a
groupoid mod "equivalent morphisms".
There is a smell of relative homotopy about, and I don't know enough
in that area.

I realise there are a couple of levels to this game, as evidenced by
Kapranov and Voevodsky in their paper on 2-cats and the Zamolodchikov
tetrahedron equations - do we take a "skeleton" at one or more
dimensions?

Any pointers appreciated
