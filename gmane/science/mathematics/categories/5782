Without seeking to prolong the use of "autonomous" today,
let me just say in my defense that, at the time I brought
that term into use, I was thinking it was the sort of
place-holder name that would, eventually, be replaced (as
it has been) by something more appropriate. This was, as I
recall, also the original motivation for the term "exact";
fortunately for its coiners, "exact" worked so well that
it never did need to get replaced. "Autonomous," on the =

other hand, was not nearly as felicitous a choice, and has
long since been superceded -- I have no qualms about that,
nor any regrets (all the fewer because, as I recall, I was
at that time thinking only of symmetric closed monoidal
categories V for which the Set-valued Hom functor V(E, -) =

(E the monoidal unit object) was faithful :-) ).

Cheers, -- Fred
