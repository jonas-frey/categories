Related to this is the use of what is essentially the Yoneda lemma in
normalisation proofs. For example Britton's lemma (giving normal forms
for words in an HNN extension) proceeds by taking the set of "normal
forms" and showing that it is a torsor for the group G at issue. In
other words one takes a presheaf on G and shows that it is
representable, and so is isomorphic to G itself. Another argument of a
similar Yoneda kind is the usual proof of the Poincare--Birkhoff--Witt
theorem (giving a basis for the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie
algebra). In fact the technique is very widely applicable (and very
widely applied); for instance you could prove the normal form theorem
for the simplicial category using it. A related (but more general)
technique is what is sometimes called "normalization by evaluation" by
computer scientists; Peter Dybjer has some articles on the relation to
the Yoneda lemma. But that is maybe straying a bit far from
undergraduate mathematics.
