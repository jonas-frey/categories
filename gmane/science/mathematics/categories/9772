We have several openings in mathematics at Utrecht, see the short
advertisement and the link to the official application website below.
Please circulate this announcement as widely as possible.

**************************************************************
The Mathematical Institute of Utrecht University invites applications
for several positions of
Tenure Track Assistant Professors in Mathematics,including Westerdijk
Fellowships.

In the Division of Fundamental Mathematics, we are searching for
candidates whose expertise is in algebraic, arithmetic or differential
geometry, including number theory, automorphic forms, algebraic
topology, geometric analysis, Lie theory, and mathematical logic.

In the Division of Mathematical Modelling, we are searching for
candidates whose expertise is in applied analysis or scientific
computing, including data science, machine learning, networks, complex
systems, imaging, high performance computing, and mathematical biology.
The appointment?is at the level of assistant professor (?universitair
docent?, lecturer), initially for a period of 5 years. The position will
be subject to a mid-term evaluation after approximately 2.5 years and an
end-term evaluation. Following a positive evaluation the position will
become permanent after 5 years. In case of sufficient seniority, the
position can be tenured at a higher level.

Female candidates are strongly urged to apply and will be considered for
a Westerdijk Fellowship, an attractive startup package created by the
Faculty of Science in order to increase its number of female scientists.

Apply before 1 Feb 2019
