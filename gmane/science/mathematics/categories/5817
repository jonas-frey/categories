The notion of P-monoidal functor C --> D, for P an operad,=20
may be described most expediently when D has small colimits,=20
and these distribute over tensors: for then the functor=20
category [C,D] is itself monoidal under Day convolution, and=20
a P-monoidal functor is nothing but a P-algebra in this=20
functor category.

Such a definition admits an obvious generalisation to the=20
case where P is not an operad, but merely a PROP; however, it=20
seems to me that such a generalisation has no force. For=20
instance, when P is the PROP for coalgebras the notion of=20
P-monoidal functor is nothing like that of an oplax monoidal=20
functor. The problem is one of variance; in giving a=20
comultiplication F -> F * F one is required to map into a=20
coend, which is back-to-front.

One way of throwing this into focus is by considering the=20
case where D has no colimits to speak of, so that the functor=20
category [C,D] is not monoidal, but merely a multicategory.=20
In any multicategory, one may still speak of a P-algebra for=20
an operad---thereby allowing the notion of P-monoidal=20
morphism of Aguiar and Mahajan to find its fully general=20
expression---but the notion of P-algebra for an arbitrary=20
PROP no longer makes sense.

The moral is that a PROP in general may be built from=20
components which originate "in algebra" and components which=20
originate "in coalgebra"; or, indeed, from components which=20
originate in neither. It is, I think, only when all=20
components originate "in algebra"---which is to say that the=20
PROP is an operad---that the notion of P-monoidal functor is=20
mathematically sensible.

However, all is not lost; for many of the PROPs of interest=20
are not just PROPs, but instances of some smaller notion=20
which allows "algebraic" and "coalgebraic" components=20
interacting according to some particular discipline. For=20
example, there is Gan's notion of dioperad, which is=20
essentially that of a one-object polycategory. The PROP for a=20
Frobenius algebra is an example of such a dioperad. Now, we=20
may speak of models for a dioperad in any polycategory; and=20
in particular, the functor category [C,D] between two=20
monoidal categories bears such a polycategorical structure,=20
wherein a model for the dioperad for Frobenius algebras is=20
precisely a Frobenius monoidal functor. Jeff Egger has=20
studied circumstances under which this polycategorical=20
structure of [C,D] is representable, and almost certainly=20
discusses this example of Frobenius monoidal functors; but he=20
is much more qualified than me to speak on this!
