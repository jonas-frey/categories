Hallo,

it would look interesting to me to show that uniqueness up to isomorphism
requires some kind of choice, e.g. by proving that it implies some choice
principle. I started thinking about this and came to the following
observation:

Let K be the field obtained from Q by adjoining all square roots of
(positive) primes or - equivalently - of all positive rational numbers.
Then an algebraic closureof K is obviously the same as an algebraic
closure of Q - even without choice. Now consider an arbitrary sequence of
two element sets S(n), w.l.o.g. pairwise disjoint, and let S be their
union. Now consider the polynomial ring Q(S) over Q in variables x(s) for
all s in S. For each natural number n let p(n) be the n-th prime and
consider the poynomials f_n:=x(s)+x(t) and g_n:=x(s)x(t)+p(n)  in Q(S)
where S(n) consists of the two elements s and t. Now let K' be the factor
ring obtained from Q(S) by dividing out all f_n and g_n. If we have a
choice function which assigns to each n an element s(n) in S(N), then
there is a unique isomorphism from K' to K that maps each s(n) to the
(positive)  square root of p(n). Conversely, if we have an arbitrary
isomorphism j from K' to K, we get a choice function which chooses for the
each n unique s(n) in S(n) with j(n)>0.  Thus existence of an isomorphism
is equivalent to existence of a choice function.

If the existence of an algebraic closure of K' could be shown without
choice, then an isomorphism fom this algebraic closure to the set of
algebraic complex numbers would restrict to an isomorphism between K and
K' and thus render a chioce function for the S(n). Thus the
uniqueness-up-to-isomorphism would imply choice for countable families of
two-element sets. Maybe refinement oft his argument could even be used to
get stronger choice principles.
