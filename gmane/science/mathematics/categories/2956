I have seen in this mail that the suggestion of Taylor and Johnstone to
replace cartesian and cocartesian maps by prone and supine ones begins to
be accepted. When I first saw that suggestion, I was so amazed that I
thought it was a joke, and not such a good one. I still hope it is no more
than that. But, just in case, and before it is too late, I want to say
that I am very strongly opposed to such changes for many reasons:
linguistic, mathematical, and ethical, which I am ready to explain in
detail if I am asked to do so.
