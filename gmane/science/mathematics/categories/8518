There is now a second preprint in our series on multiple categories:

M. Grandis - R. Par=E9
Limits in multiple categories (On weak and lax multiple categories, II)
Pubbl. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 605 (2015).

Abstract. Continuing our first paper in this series, we study =20
multiple limits in infinite-dimensional multiple categories. The =20
general setting is chiral multiple categories - a weak, partially lax =20=

form with directed interchanges.
After defining multiple limits we prove that all of them can be =20
constructed from (multiple) products, equalisers and tabulators - all =20=

of them assumed to be respected by faces and degeneracies. Tabulators =20=

appear thus to be the basic higher limits, as was already the case =20
for double categories.
Intercategories, a laxer form of multiple category already studied in =20=

two previous papers, are also considered. In this more general =20
setting the basic multiple limits mentioned above can still be =20
defined, but their general theory is not developed here.

The first paper of the series is:

An introduction to multiple categories (On weak and lax multiple =20
categories, I)
