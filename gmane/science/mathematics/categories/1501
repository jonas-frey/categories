East and North America. At the airport, S-Bahn trains are leaving for Munich
Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) every 20 minutes, taking about 45 minutes.

>From Munich Central Station there are trains to Fischbachau (direction
Bayrischzell, platform 27-31) leaving (almost) every hour, taking 70 minutes to
Fischbachau Bahnhof.
