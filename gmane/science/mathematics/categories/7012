Dear All,

While I agree that category theory is not just generalized abelian=20
category theory, there are nonetheless some theorems along the=20
lines that Dmitry suggests. Richard mentioned one; here is another.
Of course neither is nearly as simple as the abelian case.=20

If the opposite of the categories A and B are exact Mal'cev, then any
functor f:A->B which preserves finite colimits and regular monos =
preserves equalizers
of coreflexive pairs. Thus any functor f:A->B which preserves finite =
colimits, finite products
and regular monos preserves all finite limits.

In particular, A and B could be toposes, then if f:A->B preserves finite =
colimits, finite
products, and monomorphisms, it preserves all finite limits.=20

=46rom the point of view of George's example, the problem is that in the =
category 2, the
map 0->1 is mono but not regular mono.=20

Best wishes,

Steve Lack.
