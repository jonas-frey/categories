Dear John,

Those are rather pertinent examples, as the dagger closed and hypergraph cat=
egories show up a weakness in my question.

I asked about seeking objects, morphisms, identities and associative composi=
tion, which seems very natural because it's the basic definition of category=
. Everything has a domain and a codomain, an input and an output, and compos=
ition is malformed unless it's domain with codomain. This leads many of our c=
ategory theoretic intuitions to be based on thinking of objects and morphism=
s as being, at some level of abstraction, like sets and functions.

Once you have set up the structure of what is input and what is output, it t=
akes some effort to forget it. Dagger closed and the associated string diagr=
ams provide a mechanism for doing that.

A good example is Rel. A morphism from X1 x ... x Xm to Y1 x ... x Yn is jus=
t a subset of X1 x ... x Xm x Y1 x ... x Yn, in the light of which it is per=
haps perverse to impose domain and codomain structure - unless, perhaps you w=
ant to carry on to say which relations are functional.

As you propose, this certainly looks like a good way to analyse networks, an=
d open systems where there is an interface between internal structure and ex=
ternal behaviour, an interface along which we must compose components.

I've heard Jamie Vicary and others use the word "compositionality" as someth=
ing not quite the same as category theory. Is this what they mean, letting g=
o of the strict domain-codomain discipline?

All the best,

Steve.
