                       LAST CALL FOR PAPERS

                          JOINT MEETING OF

            the Twenty-Third EACSL Annual Conference on
                    COMPUTER SCIENCE LOGIC (CSL)
                                AND
           the Twenty-Ninth Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on
                  LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (LICS)

                 July 14=E2=80=9318, 2014, Vienna, Austria

                    http://vsl2014.at/csl-lics/

CSL is the annual meeting of the European Association for Computer Science
Logic (EACSL) intended for computer scientists whose research activities
involve logic, as well as for logicians working on issues significant for
computer science.

LICS is an annual international forum on theoretical and practical topics i=
n
computer science that relate to logic.

The organizers of these two series of meetings have chosen to join the 2014
editions of these meetings into a single event within the Federated Logic
Conference (FLoC) that will be part of the Vienna Summer of Logic 2014. Thu=
s,
in 2014, these meetings will have one program committee, one program, and o=
ne
proceedings. No decision has been made to hold CSL and LICS jointly beyond
2014.

We invite submissions on topics that fit the themes of both conferences. Th=
ese
topics include (but are not limited to):

Automata theory; automated deduction; categorical models and logics;
constraints programming; constructive mathematics; database theory; decisio=
n
procedures; domain theory; finite model theory; formal languages; formal
methods in software engineering; foundations of computability; functional a=
nd
reactive synthesis; game semantics; graph games; higher-order logic; lambda
and combinatory calculi; linear logic; logic programming; logics for AI;
logics of programs; logical aspects of computational complexity; modal and
temporal logics; model checking; program analysis; proof theory; semantics =
of
programming languages; specification and verification of hardware, software=
,
and complex systems; term rewriting; and type theory.

Also welcome are papers describing models and logics for biological systems=
;
concurrent, distributed, and mobile computation; quantum computation;
security; and real-time, probabilistic, and hybrid systems.


INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS

Authors are required to submit a paper title and a short abstract of about =
100
words in advance of submitting the full paper. Every full paper must be
submitted in the IEEE Proceedings 2-column 10-point format and may not be
longer than 10 pages, including references. The full paper must be in Engli=
sh
and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess its
merits. Full proofs may appear in a technical appendix which will be read a=
t
the reviewers' discretion. Authors are strongly encouraged to include a wel=
l
written introduction which is directed at all members of the program
committee.

The results reported in submissions must be unpublished and not submitted f=
or
publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia or
workshops. The program chairs must be informed in advance of submission of =
any
closely related work submitted or about to be submitted to a conference or
journal. Authors of accepted papers are expected to sign copyright release
forms. One author of each accepted paper is expected to present that paper =
at
the conference.

Paper selection will be merit-based, with no a priori limit on the number o=
f
accepted papers.

Papers authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are not
allowed.


DEADLINES

The exact deadline time on these dates is given by anywhere on earth (AoE).

Title and Short Abstracts Due        January 13, 2014
Full Papers Due                      January 20, 2014
Author Notification                    March 31, 2014
Final Versions Due for Proceedings       May 15, 2014

Deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be possible.

All submissions are made electronically via
<http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcsllics2014>.


AWARDS

The Kleene Award for Best Student Paper will be given for the best student
paper(s), as judged by the program committee.

The EACSL Outstanding Dissertation Award, named for Wilhelm F. Ackermann, w=
ill
be presented during the joint meeting.

The LICS Test-of-Time Award 2014 will be presented during the joint meeting=
