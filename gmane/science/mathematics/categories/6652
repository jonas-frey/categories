===============================================================

CALCO 2011 will be preceded by the CALCO Young Researchers Workshop,
CALCO-Jnr, dedicated to presentations by PhD students and by those who
completed their doctoral studies within the past few years.

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with
interests
in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging uses of
algebras
and coalgebras in computer science. The study of algebra and coalgebra
relates to the data, process and structural aspects of software systems.
This is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces
and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic
Methods
in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development
Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Swansea (Wales,
2005),
Bergen (Norway, 2007) and Udine (Italy, 2009). The fourth edition will
be
held in the city of Winchester (England), a historic cathedral city
and the
ancient capital of Wessex and the Kingdom of England.

The CALCO Young Researchers Workshop, CALCO-Jnr, is a CALCO satellite
workshop dedicated to presentations by PhD students and young
researchers.
Attendance at the workshop is open to all - it is anticipated that many
CALCO conference participants will want to attend the CALCO-Jnr workshop
(and vice versa).


Topics of Interest
-----------------------
The CALCO Young Researchers Workshop invites submissions on the same
topics as the CALCO conference: reporting results of theoretical work on
the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the way these results can
support methods and techniques for software development, as well as
experience with the transfer of the resulting technologies into
industrial
practice. In particular, the workshop encourages submissions related
to the topics listed below.

* Abstract models and logics
- Automata and languages,
- Categorical semantics,
- Modal logics,
- Relational systems,
- Graph transformation,
- Term rewriting,
- Adhesive categories

* Specialised models and calculi
- Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems,
- Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed,
    mobile, and context-aware computing,
- General systems theory and computational models
    (chemical, biological, etc)

* Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
- Abstract data types,
- Inductive and coinductive methods,
- Re-engineering techniques (program transformation),
- Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques,
- Semantics of programming languages

* System specification and verification
- Algebraic and coalgebraic specification,
- Formal testing and quality assurance,
- Validation and verification,
- Generative programming and model-driven development,
- Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
    hardware/middleware/architectures,
- Process algebra


Submission
----------------
CALCO-Jnr presentations will be selected according to originality,
significance, and general interest, on the basis of submitted 2-page
abstracts. A booklet with the abstracts of the accepted presentations
will be available at the workshop.

Submissions are handled via the following link:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calcojnr2011.
The use of LNCS style (see http://www.springer.de/compo/lncs/authors.html)
is strongly encouraged.

After the workshop, the author(s) of each presentation will be invited
to
submit a full 10-15 page paper on the same topic. They will also be
asked
to write (anonymous) reviews of papers submitted by other authors on
related topics. Additional reviewing and the final selection of papers
will be carried out by the CALCO-Jnr PC.

The volume of selected papers from the workshop will be published as a
technical report of the University of Southampton. Authors will retain
copyright, and are also encouraged to disseminate the results reported
at
CALCO-Jnr by subsequent publication elsewhere.
