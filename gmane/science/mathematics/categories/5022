All,

This is an argument about effective theories and so i would love to hear
from the topos-theory crowd. i'll state the argument in lowly computational
terms, using two distinct proposals for foundational models of computing:
the lambda calculus and the =F0-calculus. Both the lambda calculus and the
=F0-calculus suffer a dependence on a theory of names (aka variables). Both
require two things of whatever theory of names is provided to them:

   - at least countably infinitely many names
   - an effective equality on names

Now, to this recent proposals[1] add a third constraint, namely

   - names are atomic -- they have no internal structure

To my way of thinking these three constraints are incompatible. i cannot se=
e
how to make an effective equality on a countably infinite set of entities
that have no internal structure on which to rest the equality check. It
seems to me that the only possible expression of the equality is an infinit=
e
table which states the results of comparing every single pair of atoms --
which is not going to fit into any realizable model of computation of which
i'm aware and understand.

Is there a way around this? If there is, i would be eternally grateful to b=
e
enlightened.

The reason i focus on foundational proposals for theories of computation is
that one could drop the atomic requirement and allow names to have internal
structure, but because of the other two constraints one is dangerously clos=
e
to sneaking into a supposedly foundational account a theory of names that i=
s
-- itself -- already sufficiently rich to model computation. (For example,
in many implementations of lambda or =F0-calculus, names are ultimately
represented as integers.) This would appear to undermine the foundational
character of the model of computation in question. This has led me to
constructions in which the internal structure of names *reflects* the
structure of computations. In fact, this idea has a simple monadic
characterization, but that's for another discussion.

i've already posted to this list an intuitive account of red/black set
theories that also side-step the issue of atoms with no structure which
allows to recast the FM-Set-Theory-based accounts of names onto what appear=
s
to me to be the only construction that meets all the requirements mentioned
above: sufficiently many names, effective equality, restricting internal
structure of names to the structure of the proposal at hand. Again, if ther=
e
is a way to skate around this argumentation or debunk it, please consider
this a sincere call for help to do so.

Best wishes,
