I have just uploaded to CTAN the latest version of diagxy.  It is also 
available from my own web site: http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/papers/. 
The main thing it does is work well with the beamer macro \uncover (and 
relatives) to allow you use the node and arrow mode to add arrows (or for 
that matter, nodes) as overlays on diagrams.  It also solves a problem 
that one user reported to me that the registration on repeatedly laying 
down the same ink was not perfect and he claimed that his nodes were 
thickened.  I never observed this but the same fix apparently fixes it. 
Also, I have added \hyperref to the diaxydoc file.
