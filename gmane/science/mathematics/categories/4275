I'm curious what you mean by this.  One of my duties as Managing Editor
of Homology, Homotopy and Applications is to oversee the copyediting and
typesetting, and I produce the final versions of all files in dvi, ps
and pdf format on my linux machine.  We receive files using quite a
variety of graphics packages, including the "graphics" package, and
rarely have any problems with the resulting dvi files.  (I test using
xdvi.)  The only problem I can recall is with figures that are rotated
90 degrees, and for such papers we simply don't make the dvi file
publicly available.

The pdf files for HHA are almost always produced using dvipdfm, and
again this works quite reliably in my experience.  In some cases, we use
pdflatex, and again I have had no trouble with it.  dvipdfm works even
in the one or two cases where xdvi didn't display a file correctly,
such as with rotated figures.

And while for most files I regard dvi as the primary processed archive,
I also use the snapshot package to save most of the .sty files each
article includes, so that if necessary in the future the articles can be
reprocessed to produce some hypothetical new format that contains
information not in the dvi file.  (E.g. to add hyperlinks to all
articles.)

While I am writing, I'd like to encourage readers of this list to submit
articles to HHA and to ask their libraries to subscribe if they don't
already.  The price is quite reasonable, and we regularly publish
articles with a categorical bent.  All articles are available online at

  http://intlpress.com/HHA

You can receive announcements of new articles by writing directly to me
and asking to be put on the announcements mailing list.

Best wishes,

Dan
