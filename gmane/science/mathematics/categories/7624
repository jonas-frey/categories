Dear Category Theorists,

We are delighted to announce the full schedule of talks
for the British Mathematical Colloquium and the associated
"Extraordinary" 94th PSSL, Monday 25th March - Thursday 28th
March.

The information can be found on the PSSL webpage

http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/pssl94/

The PSSL will run from 9.30am until 2.30pm on the Monday;
even if you don't arrive first thing in the morning, you are
welcome to join us for whatever talks you can.

On the above page you can also find a link to the Second
Announcement, which contains information about registering
for the main BMC.  The deadline is March 15th so there should
still just about be time to register!  For PSSL registration

We look forward to welcoming you to Sheffield.  Please do not
hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions.

Eugenia Cheng and Nick Gurski
