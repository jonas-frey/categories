Dear Steve,

The setting of a 2-category GTop bounded over an elementary topos S has been=
  extensibly worked out in practice in (for instance) the book by Marta Bunge=
  and Jonathon Funk, Singular Coverings of Toposes, LNM 1890, Springer 2006, a=
nd in several papers by myself or with collaborators which you can look up i=
n my Research Gate page. The terminology that I have used for it everywhere (=
including lectures) is Top_S, by which it is not meant Top/S but the sub 2-c=
ategory of it whose objects are bounded geometric morphisms between elementa=
ry toposes, with codomain S. In particular It often becomes necessary to con=
sider change of base. The terminology is well adapted to the consideration o=
f certain distinguished sub 2-categories of Top_S - for instance LTop_S deno=
tes that whose objects are geometric morphisms with codomain S and a locally=
  connected elementary topos. I hope this is useful to you.=20

Cordial regards,
Marta
