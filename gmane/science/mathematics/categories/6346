A couple of things.  First, I neglected to mention that "Communes via=20
Yoneda, from an Elementary Perspective," Fundamenta Informaticae 123=20
(2010) 1=9616, DOI 10.3233/FI-2010-315 is about to appear and won't be=20
findable by Google just yet.  Those interested in seeing it sooner can=20
find it on my site at

http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/CommunesFundInf2010.pdf

Second, as I said I wasn't passing judgment on the wisdom of avoiding=20
the term "schzophrenic" but merely pointing out the associated cost,=20
which needs to be balanced against the harm of any given word.

So I followed Tom's pointer

    http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dualizing+object

linking to a discussion of alternatives, which seemed inconclusive.  Sam=20
(Staton?) made the point however that even if schizophrenia is not the=20
appropriate word, schizo is the appropriate prefix, having derived from=20
the Greek "split."

So it is the medical condition that is inappropriately named, namely as=20
"split madness," with phrenitis and frenzy having a common origin.

With that in mind it occurred to me that "schismatic" might be a=20
suitable alternative, as providing better continuity with the older=20
terminology by coming from the same root schizo, but more honestly so=20
than schizophrenia since in this case there really is a multiple=20
personality, and moreover there's nothing insane about it.  (And it's a=20
syllable shorter to boot.)

Third, while it is true that the schismatic object (to give the term a=20
trial run) is usually observed manifesting its split personality in=20
different categories, this is not the case in *-autonomous categories=20
where I and _|_ are the Jekyll and Hyde of the same category.  (I=20
apologize to readers of this list with either of those surnames.)

In all the examples I'm aware of, the two categories in which the=20
schismatic object occurs (once in each) admit a common completion to a=20
*-autonomous category which embeds one object as I and the other as _|_.=20
   Considering them to be the "same" object found in two categories=20
misses the contravariance between them, which is brought out more=20
clearly by this joint completion, where they are clearly not the same=20
object but a pair of dual objects.

My paper accounts for C.I. Lewis's qualia by viewing them as morphisms=20
running from I to _|_.  If I and _|_ are rigid (|C(x,x)|=3D1) as for=20
Chu(Set,K)), the presence of a morphism from _|_ to I is inconsistent in=20
the sense that it collapses Hom(I,_|_) to a singleton, since I and _|_=20
respectively generate and cogenerate.  So in order to have more than one=20
quale (in the Chu setting) there cannot be any morphism from _|_ to I.=20
(That was mainly in the nature of background on the neighborhood of I=20
and _|_.)
