Dear all,

I recently came across an intriguing volume entitled "Morphisms and
Categories: Comparing and Transforming". The lead author is Piaget,
one of the foremost names in developmental psychology, who died in
1980. The volume is a collection of papers, many of which seem to
enthusiastically apply ideas of category theory to developmental
psychology.

I haven't seen the book itself, but this link lets you read the full
introduction and the first page of each chapter:
    http://www.questia.com/library/6364330/morphisms-and-categories-comparing-and-transforming

Reading the introduction, it's clear that Piaget took very seriously
the idea that category theory could provide a formal foundation for
psychology. Does this perspective survive in the modern psychology
literature? Does anybody know how Piaget came to be acquainted with
these categorical ideas in the first place? Is there anything here
that could be of interest to modern category theorists?

Best wishes,
Jamie.
