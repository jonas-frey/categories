Further to my previous message, here is an announcement for students. If
you are in a position to post this to students who might be interested,
that would be a great help to us. Even more if you can access funds to
support their travel! We have some of our own, but it's limited.

Steve.

Subject line: "YaMKittens - 1-day Introduction to Category Theory, 28
March in Birmingham"

To: Undergraduates or masters students

- in maths and related disciplines such as physics and computer science

You may have heard of Category Theory, a particular style of structuring
mathematics that emphasizes the ways in which different objects can
connect to each other ("morphisms"), and how the morphisms can be strung
together. Originating in algebraic topology, it is now applied in
increasingly many subject areas in maths and beyond, including computer
science and physics.

If you don't know much about categories but are intrigued by the idea of
research either in category theory or using it, you will be interested
in a 1-day meeting "YaMKittens" on Saturday 28 March at Birmingham
University. Two speakers, Tom Leinster and Bob Coecke, will give an
introduction to the basics and some fascinating applications in quantum
physics.

Attendance is free, but we do ask you to register in advance. Further
information is at -
