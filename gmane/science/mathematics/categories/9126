CALL FOR TALK PROPOSALS


LOLA 2017: Syntax and Semantics of Low-Level Languages
======================================================
Monday, 19 June 2017, Reykjavik, Iceland
A satellite workshop of LICS 2017
http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/lola2017/


Important Dates
---------------

- Abstract submission: Wednesday, 19 April 2017
- Author notification: Monday, 1 May 2017
- Workshop: Monday, 19 June 2017


Invited Speakers
----------------

- TBD

Context
-------

Since the late 1960s it has been known that tools and structures
arising in mathematical logic and proof theory can usefully be applied
to the design of high-level programming languages, and to the
development of reasoning principles for such languages. Yet low-level
languages, such as machine code, and the compilation of high-level
languages into low-level ones have traditionally been seen as having
little or no essential connection to logic.

However, a fundamental discovery of this past decade has been that
low-level languages are also governed by logical principles. From this
key observation has emerged an active and fascinating new research
area at the frontier of logic and computer science. The practically-
motivated design of logics reflecting the structure of low-level
languages (such as heaps, registers and code pointers) and low-level
properties of programs (such as resource usage) goes hand in hand with
some of the most advanced contemporary research in semantics and proof
theory, including classical realizability and forcing, double
orthogonality, parametricity, linear logic, game semantics,
uniformity, categorical semantics, explicit substitutions, abstract
machines, implicit complexity and resource bounded programming.

The LOLA workshop, affiliated with LICS 2017, will bring together
researchers interested in the relationships and connections between
logic and low-level languages and programs. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:

- Typed assembly languages
- Certified assembly programming
- Certified and certifying compilation
- Relaxed memory models
- Proof-carrying code
- Program optimization
- Modal logic and realizability in machine code
- Realizability and double orthogonality in assembly code
- Parametricity, modules and existential types
- General references, Kripke models and recursive types
- Continuations and concurrency
- Resource analysis and implicit complexity
- Closures and explicit substitutions
- Linear logic and separation logic
- Game semantics, abstract machines and hardware synthesis
- Monoidal and premonoidal categories, traces and effects


Submission
----------

LOLA is an informal workshop aiming at a high degree of useful
interaction amongst the participants, welcoming proposals for talks on
work in progress, overviews of larger research programs, position
presentations, and short tutorials, as well as more traditional
research talks describing new results.

The program committee will select the workshop presentations from
submitted talk proposals, which may take the form either of a *two
page abstract* or of a longer (published or unpublished) paper
describing completed work.

Authors are invited to submit their contribution by April 28, 2017.
Abstracts must be written in English and be submitted as a single PDF
file at
[EasyChair](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lola2017).

Submissions will undergo a lightweight review process and will be
judged on originality, relevance, interest and clarity. Submission
should describe novel works or works that have already appeared
elsewhere but that can stimulate the discussion between different
communities at the workshop.

The workshop will not have formal proceedings and is not intended to
preclude later publication at another venue.
