That's a good point.  However, if C is a non-strict category, then
while you can define products over its preset of objects, such a
product is no longer necessarily a particular case of a limit, since
the preset may not have any "discrete" category structure.  So while
you can construct limits over arbitrary (non-strict) categories via
"products" and equalizers if you generalize the notion of "product" in
this way, the converse now fails -- having all limits doesn't seem to
guarantee that you have all "products" in this generalized sense.
