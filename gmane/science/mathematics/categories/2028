=========================================================================

                         GENERAL INFORMATION

TACS2001 will be held on the campus of Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.
The invited talks and contributed talks will be presented at the Aoba
Memorial Building, Faculty of Engineering located on the Aoba Hill about
3 km west of downtown Sendai. The welcome reception and banquet will be
held at Sendai Tokyu Hotel, located in downtown Sendai.
The TACS2001 proceedings will be available as a volume of Lecture Notes
in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, at the time of the conference.

Sendai is the largest city in the northern part of Honshu Island of Japan,
with a population of about a million. The city is known in Japan as the
"City of Trees". It is 350 km north of Tokyo and about 2 hours away by
the Tohoku Bullet Train (Tohoku Shinkansen). Sendai is a modern, safe city
with a moderate climate blessed by four distinct seansons. At the end of
October the weather would be mostly sunny with temperature ranging from
5 C (41 F) to 15 C (59 F), and it will be the time of beautiful autumnal 
tints.

Conference registration is open to the public. Reservations for the Japanese
dinner party (October 31st) will be limited.
Register and make reservations by returning the completed form by email and
fax. The registration form is attached below, and it is also available from
the TACS2001 web site.
There will also be on-site registration at:
  * Sendai Tokyu Hotel, 16:00 - 21:00, October 28,
  * Aoba Memorial Bldg, Tohoku Univ, 9:00 - 17:00 on October 29-31.

Some information on transportation and hotels is described below. More
information on TACS2001, including travel information, is available at
the TACS2001 web page:

         http://tacs2001.ito.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/tacs2001/

Transportation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Conference participants arriving at the new Tokyo International (Narita)
Airport are advised to take the JR Narita Express train from Narita
Airport to Tokyo Station. Then take the Yamabiko super express train of
Tohoku Shinkansen (Tohoku Bullet Train) from Tokyo to Sendai. Making
reservation at Narita Station for the Yamabiko is strongly recommended.
Those arriving at the new Osaka International (Kansai) Airport can fly
to Sendai Airport, and take Limousine Bus service to Sendai Station.
Alternatively, you can take a local train from the Kansai Airport to
JR Shin Osaka Station, then take the Tokaido Shinkansen from JR Shin
Osaka Station to JR Tokyo Station and change at Tokyo Station to Tohoku
Shinkansen.
Some details on transportation will be available at the TACS2001 web page.
Note: 
(1) No flight service is available from Narita to Sendai Airport, since 
    the train service is superior. There is another train service from
    Narita Airport to downtown Tokyo (Ueno) by Skyliner of the Keisei-Narita 
    Line. At Ueno you can take the Yamabiko superexpress of Tohoku Shinkansen
    to Sendai, but you have to walk about 10 min from Keisei Ueno Station to
    JR Ueno Station to take Tohoku Shinkansen.
(2) If you are going to travel in Japan by JR lines before/after the 
    TACS2001 symposium, it will be convenient and economical to get a 
    JR PASS before your departure. Contact your travel agent for more 
    information on JR PASS (Japan Rail Pass).

Hotels
^^^^^^
Two hotels offer discount rates to TACS2001 participants: the Sendai Tokyu
Hotel, and the Sendai Washington Hotel. They are 1.2 km west of Sendai
Station and about 800 Yen by taxi from the station. Two hotels are located 
within 5 min walk of each other.

More information on TACS2001 is available at the TACS2001 web page.
