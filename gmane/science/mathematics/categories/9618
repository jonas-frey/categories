Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop that brings
together researchers in theoretical computer science and category theory.
Past workshops have had discussions on areas such as quantum programming
languages, restriction categories, database design, and the differential an=
d
resource logics. They have been held at Colgate, Dalhousie, Kananaskis (U
of=A0 Calgary), Mount Allison, Ottawa, UBC, Spokane, and Portland. The 2018
workshop is informal and interdisciplinary.

There will be an informal welcoming reception in the evening of May 30th.
The scientific program starts on May 31st, and consists of tutorials and
contributed talks. The meeting ends on the afternoon of June 2nd.

Confirmed tutorial speakers:

Kristine Bauer (Calgary)
Ernie Manes (Massachusetts)
Robert Pare (Dalhousie)
Peter Selinger (Dalhousie)

Note that the arrival day this year is Wednesday, and talks will end
Saturday afternoon. Participants will have time to travel on Saturday eithe=
r
to Halifax for QPL and MFPS, or to Fredericton for the CMS meeting.

We particularly encourage graduate students to attend FMCS and to present
their work.

Anyone interested in attending is kindly requested to notify Bob Rosebrugh
(rrosebrugh@mta.ca). Please let us know by May 10th. If you wish to give a
talk, please also send a title and short abstract. Some limited funding
toward accommodation and travel expenses is available to support graduate
students who attend FMCS. To apply for this funding you should contact Geof=
f
Cruttwell (gcruttwell@mta.ca).
