Dear Andre,

I think category theorists have done an excellent job at publicizing the
secret. I am very much struck at category meetings what a variety of
backgrounds the participants come from, lots from computer science of
course, and now increasingly many physicists. It seems to me this is
exactly because category theory has the qualities you describe. It
enables the pure category theorists, the computer scientists, the
physicists to meet and talk together with a high degree of mutual
understanding.

I don't think of myself as a pure category theorist, but I can't imagine
trying to do what I do without it.

All the best,

Steve.
