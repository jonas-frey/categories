Yes, this is what I call the "funny" tensor product on Cat.

Categories enriched in Cat with the funny tensor product are
called "sesquicategories": they are less than 2-categories as they
have whiskering but only ambiguous horizontal composition of 2-cells.

There is a bit of literature on all this. For example, it is mentioned =
in

Categorical structures, Handbook of Algebra Volume 1 (editor M. =
Hazewinkel; Elsevier Science, Amsterdam 1996; ISBN 0 444 82212 7) =
529-577.

and/or

Higher categories, strings, cubes and simplex equations, Applied =
Categorical Structures 3 (1995) 29- 77 & 303; MR96b:18009.

As to finding all the symmetric monoidal closed structures on a locally =
finitely presentable category,=20
the object-in-two-categories technique is provided by

F. Foltz, GM. Kelly and C. Lair, Algebraic categories with few monoidal =
biclosed structures or none,=20
J. Pure and Applied Algebra 17 (1980) 171=96177.

Perhaps they even give the Cat example.
