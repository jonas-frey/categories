6 Month Postdoc Position
Mathematically Structured Programming Group
University of Strathclyde
Scotland

We have the potential to apply for funds for a 6 month post doctoral =
position. The idea is that the successful candidate would spend those 6 =
months writing a full scale grant to fund themselves for the next 3 =
years.
The postdoctoral position would be within the Mathematically Structured =
Programing group at the University of Strathclyde whose research =
focusses on category theory, type theory and functional programming. =
Current staff include Neil Ghani, Patricia Johann, Conor McBride, Peter =
Hancock, Robert Atkey and 6 PhD students.=20
The candidate we are looking for should be highly self motivated and =
appreciate that without beauty, we are lost.

Unfortunately, the deadline is extremely short and so any interested =
candidates should contact me immediately. I can then tell you more about =
what we would need to do.=20

All the best

Professor Neil Ghani
