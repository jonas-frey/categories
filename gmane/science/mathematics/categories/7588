The Mathematical Foundations group at the University of Bath is offering
a Ph.D. position in foundations of computation:

    Computational and representational aspects of modern proof systems

In developing the mathematical foundations of computation, a central
insight is that formal proofs can be viewed as computer programs. In
this direction, a recent discovery by members of the group, in
collaboration with international colleagues, is a correspondence between
modern proof methods and computation over geometric objects. The
position will be part of a larger project to further develop this
connection. The particular task will be to develop and investigate
computational calculi arising from this correspondence.

The Mathematical Foundations group is a diverse and active research
community within the Department of Computer Science. The group is
world-class in the area of logic and semantics, and is internationally
well-connected. Its members have an excellent record of supervising
Ph.D. candidates, many of whom have gone on to establish themselves as
successful independent researchers. The prospective supervisor for the
advertised position is Willem Heijltjes.
