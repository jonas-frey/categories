After reading Ross' message I looked at

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Mathematical_Society_Medal

It is a short article and Steve is not there because it is not updated to
2009 yet. But it is clear that Australian Mathematical Society Medal is a
very special award - and it is given to only 29 people before 2009.

Congratulations to Steve and to Australia - for awarding this medal to such
a good mathematician!

[Note from moderator: the wikipedia page has now been updated incorrectly
(surprise), but it does link to the relevant AMS page:
