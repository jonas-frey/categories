 PhD on Probabilistic Analysis of Distributed Systems
at the Institute of Computer Engineering at the
Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria

The Institute of Computer Engineering at Vienna
(http://ti.tuwien.ac.at/) University of Technology
is seeking for a PhD candidate, starting March 2015.

The successful applicant will
carry out his/her PhD in the research area of
statistical verification of (distributed) cyber-physical systems based=20=

on advanced sequential Monte-Carlo (particle filtering) techniques=20
such as importance sampling and importance splitting.
This task is part of the recently granted Austrian
FWF National Research Network =93RiSE=94 (2nd funding
period), to be led by Prof. Radu Grosu
in collaboration with Prof. Armin Biere and
Ass.-Prof. Ezio Bartocci and with the other PIs of RiSE:

http://arise.or.at/principal-investigators/

The candidates shall satisfy one or more of the following requirements:

- A degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, or =
related disciplines.
- Excellent Knowledge in verification, particle filtering, particle =
swarm optimisation
- Curiosity and out-of-the-box thinking
- Very good English skills (writing, speaking)

Knowledge of German is welcome but not required.

The positions will be fully funded for 3 years with competitive =
salaries.
In addition, PhD candidates will be provided with a laptop and funding =
for
travel expenses, including visits to conferences, workshops and other =
research groups.

The Technische Universit=E4t Wien (TU Wien) has about 20,000
students and a heavy emphasis on research in the
sciences and engineering. TU Wien comprises eight faculties
- mathematics and geo-information, physics, technical
chemistry, informatics, civil engineering, architecture
and regional planning, mechanical engineering and business
science, electrical engineering and information technology.
The Faculty of Informatics of the TU Wien comprises
about 3,000 students.

The Institute of Computer Engineering (ICE) is one of its seven computer
science institutes. The ICE=92s research and teaching
activities focus on the area of cyber-physical systems and
dependable embedded systems. Our activities are at the heart
of the primary research area Technische Informatik (Computer
Engineering) of the Faculty of Informatics, and integrate
computer science, discrete and continuous systems theory,
and microelectronics in a holistic approach. Major research
areas are hybrid systems, real-time systems, fault-tolerant
distributed algorithms, and dependable digital circuit
architectures. Particular research activities range from
formal/mathematical modeling and analysis over SW/HW
architectures to microcontroller programming and
FPGA/VLSI design.


Salary
The RiSE project is funded by the Austrian Science Fund
(Fonds zur F=F6rderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung, FWF).
In accordance with FWF regulations and the collective bargaining
agreement of the Austrian universities, the doctoral students will
be employed as a researcher at a yearly salary of EUR 20,047.38
after taxes and social/health insurance deductions (effective
April 2014; the average Austrian salary over all age groups is
EUR 20,596.00). There are additional salary supplements and tax
deductions for families with children.

Applications, including any attachments, should be
submitted by the 1st of February to the following emails:
radu.grosu-8zxNtbQCHXIjuwv8T7myQQ@public.gmane.org, ezio.bartocci-8zxNtbQCHXIjuwv8T7myQQ@public.gmane.org

The following documents must be attached to the
application:

- Cover letter stating the candidate's motivation
to apply, and the reason(s) why they should be selected
for the position
- A curriculum vitae
- Grades transcriptions and certificates
- At least one reference letter

Shortlisted applicants are expected to be interviewed during
the first week of February 2015.=
