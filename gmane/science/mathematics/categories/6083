He was probably talking about these popularizations:

A prehistory of n-categorical physics, with Aaron Lauda
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2469

Physics, logic, computation and topology: a Rosetta stone, with Mike Stay
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340

which cite the work of Joyal and Street, though sadly not the paper you
mention.

Best,
