Dear colleagues,

First, let me thank everyone who has replied so far: I am learning a
lot from this discussion (not being a category theorist myself). Far
be it from me to make sweeping statements about general category
theory, I am merely interested in particular functors between
particular categories. It just seems that preservation of monos would
be easier to check than preservation of equalizers, which is why I am
looking for general criteria.

Consider the following example. Let k-Alg denote the category of
commutative k-algebras over some ground ring k, and let

F:k-Alg-->k-Alg

denote taking coproduct with an object A. Then F preserves all
colimits and finite products; furthermore, if F preserves monos, it
preserves all finite limits (which is the case iff A is flat as a
k-module). The only proof I know takes advantage of the convenient
fact that the coproduct in k-Alg extends to the tensor product in the
abelian category k-Mod, as well as the existence of a fully faithful
functor from k-Mod to k-Alg given by the square-zero extension. If
anyone knows a proof which does not involve going to k-Mod, just using
some general properties of k-Alg, I'd be very happy to learn about it.
Notice that k-Alg is not co-Mal'cev, nor is every monomorphism
regular.

Thanks again,

Dmitry
