You are right; without choice we should be careful, and several classicall=
y equal
things become distinct. I am used to the following way of defining the pol=
ynomial ring
over a ring A in variables x(s) for all s from a given set S: Monomials ar=
e maps from
S to the set of nonnegative integers, which map all but finitely many elem=
ents to 0.
The images under this map are considered as exponents, and monomials are
multiplied by adding the exponents, and x(s) is the monomial that maps s t=
o 1 and all
other elements to 0. Then x(s)x(t) is literally the same as x(t)x(s). Anal=
ogously, we
can define polynomials as maps from the set of all monomials to A, which a=
re 0
almost every where; the images are interpreted as coefficients. Then we al=
so have
x(s)+x(t)=3Dx(t)+x(s).

However, also another definition should turm the polynomial ring into a co=
mmutative
rings; so the elements could also be defined as equivalence classes of (fi=
rst-order)
terms. The point is that x(s)x(t) should bet taken as an element of the (c=
ommutative)
polynomial ring, not as a term; the terms x(s)x(t)and x(t)x(s) are indeed =
different.

The algebraic closure of Q (or of a finite field) can be constructed by su=
ccessively
adding zeros of polynomials. Since the set of all polynomials can be numbe=
red, an
isomorphism between two different algebraic closures can be found, if on e=
ach step
we find a bijection between the finte sets of zeros of a given polynomials=
 in both
closures. This choice usually depends on the privious choices; so countabl=
e
dependent choice in finite sets (or K=F6nig's Lemma) should render the des=
ired
isomorphism. On the other hand, the situation is very specific, I do not s=
ee how
K=F6nig's Lemma should follow from the existence of isomorphism between al=
gebraic
closures of Q.

So I considered an easier case: The choices of square roots of different p=
rimes are
independent. So the isomorphism between K and K' in my example can be obta=
ined
uniquely if for every prime you have bijectin between the set of the two s=
quare roots
of a prime p in K and the set of the square roots of p in K'. ButK is orde=
red by
construction; so you obtain the bijection if fir each p you choose which o=
ne of the two
square roots of p shall be mapped to the positive square root in K': If yo=
u have the
isomorphism, you get an ordering of K'  and therefore a choice of positive=
 square
roots. So had to build the field K' for a given sequence of two-element se=
ts without
using a choice for these sets.

Of course the result is not satifactory; it was just my first idea when I =
read John Baez'
mail. Since there are also irreducible polynomials of degrees >2, I think =
that the sock
axiom (i.e. countable choise for sequences of two-element sets, i.e. choos=
ing a left
one for countably many pairs of symmetric socks) should not imply the uniq=
ueness of
the algebraic closure of Q up to isomorphism. In order to getthe converse,=
 we should
need a way to extend an isomporphism between K and K' to an isomorphism
between algebraic closures without using choice again.
