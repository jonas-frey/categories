Greetings

Let's just hope none of this creates another situation
like the one Sammy reported facing in a North African
fish restaurant, where his menu offered, among other
local delicacies, "Fried Pimp", the author evidently =

having rendered the Arabic word for the fish in question, =

actually a mackerel, first into French as "maquereau", =

and thence into English as "pimp". =


Rhymes with "shrimp" -- easier to type than "mackerel" --
so why not?

Cheers, -- Fred
