The answer is no (unless I have overlooked something below, which is all
too easy to do when cooking up pathological counterexamples).

We're looking for a category that:
 - has a dagger compact-closed structure,
 - has biproducts
 - does *not* have dagger-biproducts.

I've tried to keep the description quite concrete, perhaps too
much so for the taste of some readers of this list.

1. Let A be the category with:
   - the set of objects is the set of integers;

   - an arrow is a rational number:
     A(n,n) = Q, and
     A(m,n) = {0}, for m != n;

   - composition is multiplication;

   - the following compact closed structure:
     [ The symbol @ denotes tensor below]

     m @ n := m + n  for objects m, n
     q @ r := q x r  for arrows q, r,
     The tensor unit is the object 0,
     n* := -n;

   - the obvious preadditive structure: addition within a
     hom set is just addition of rational numbers;

   - the trivial dagger: q^\dagger := q for each arrow q.

   Note that A is a (preadditive) dagger compact closed category.

2. Let B be the category of matrices over A, i.e. the result of
   freely adding finite biproducts to A. Concretely, an
   object of B is a finite tuple of integers (n_i | i<k) for
   some natural number k. An arrow

     f: (m_i | i<k)  -->  (n_j | j<k')

   is a k x k' matrix of rational numbers, with the property that
   the (i, j)th entry is 0 unless m_i = n_j.

   Composition is matrix multiplication. The biproduct of two
   objects is their concatenation as tuples. The dagger compact
   closed structure distributes over the formal biproducts,
   in the standard way.

3. Let C be the full subcategory of B determined by those
   objects (n_i | i<k) with the property that:

     for all i<k there exists j<k s.t. n_j = -n_i.

   Note that C is closed under tensor, * and biproduct.

Of course there is a 'standard dagger' (transposition), and
a standard compact closed structure that's compatible with it.
I'll define a new dagger on C, and exhibit a compact closed
structure that's compatible with this new dagger. The purpose
of the restriction in (3) is to make it possible -- or at any
rate easier -- to define this compact closed structure. Finally
I'll show that C does not have dagger-biproducts, with respect
to this new dagger.

Given a matrix

   f: (m_i | i<k)  -->  (n_j | j<k')

let f^\dagger be the transpose of f, multiplied by the scalar

   2 ^ (max {n_j | j<k'} - max {m_i | i<k})

If either k or k' is zero, this expression is ill-defined, but
the matrix is also empty so that doesn't matter.

Below I shall write max(n_i) as an abbreviation for max {n_i | j<k};
the intended k will be clear from the context.

This dagger is clearly involutive. Also

    max( (m_i | i<k) @ (n_j | j<k') ) = max {m_i + n_j | i<k, j<k'}
                                      = max(m_i) + max(n_j),

from which it follows that this dagger is compatible with tensor.
It's thus easy to check that C is dagger symmetric monoidal w.r.t
this dagger.

For the compact closed structure, consider an object A and denote
the standard unit eta_A: (0) --> A* @ A. Define eta'_A to be the
product of eta_A with the scalar 2 ^ -max(A). By the restriction
of (3), we know that max (A* @ A) = 2 max(A), hence

  (eta'_A)^\dagger  =  (2 ^ max(A)) x epsilon_A

where epsilon_A is the standard counit. Thus the additional
scalar factor in (eta'_A)^\dagger is the reciprocal of that
in eta'_A, so they cancel out as required.


Finally, to see that C does not have dagger biproducts, consider
the objects (0) and (-1,1). The injection i: (0) --> (0,-1,1) is
a matrix [ q ] for some rational q. Then i^\dagger = [ 2q 0 0 ],
         [ 0 ]
         [ 0 ]
so i^\dagger . i : (0) -> (0) is the 1x1 matrix [ 2q^2 ]. For this
to be the identity, we would need to have 2q^2 = 1, but that
equation famously has no solution in the rationals!


Can anyone see any errors in the above, or think of a simpler example?

Robin
