Jim,
Perhaps complacency is another form of preoccupation. Very often
topologists or geometers who want a functor category say things like "this
may not exist".
Of course that is slightly better than use of quotients or limits in
analysis without asking whether they exist, but in the 21st century such
waffling is unbecoming to mathematics, especially when, as I suggest, it
can be replaced by crisp algebra.
Bill
