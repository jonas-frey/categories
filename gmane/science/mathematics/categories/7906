50th Anniversary Excellence Studentship for an Overseas Research =
Student:
    12 December 2013 is the application deadline

We offer PhD positions to brilliant graduates with an interest in =
mathematics and theoretical computer science.

Proofs and algorithms are everyday objects in our discipline, but they =
are still very mysterious. Suffice to say that we are currently unable =
to decide whether two given proofs or two given algorithms are the same; =
this is an old problem that dates back to Hilbert. Also, proofs and =
algorithms are intimately connected in the most famous open problem in =
mathematics: P vs NP.

We make progress by trying to unveil the fundamental structure behind =
proofs and algorithms, what we call their semantics. In other words, we =
are interested in the following questions:

    What is a proof?
    What is an algorithm?
    How can we define them so that they have efficient and natural =
semantics?

The questions above are interesting in their own right, but we note that =
answering them will enable technological advances of great impact on the =
society and the economy. For example, it will be possible to build a =
worldwide, universal tool for developing, validating, communicating and =
teaching mathematics. Also, quickly producing provably bug-free and =
secure software will become possible, so solving one of the most complex =
and important open engineering problems.

In order to understand proofs and algorithms we create new mathematics =
starting from proof theory and semantics and utilising, among other =
tools, category theory and algebraic geometry. These theories are =
closely related, they benefit from mutual interaction and they are well =
represented in our team. The methods we use are mostly discrete, =
algebraic and combinatorial, but there is a growing geometrical =
component. The recent advances which our methods are mostly based on are =
linear logic, game semantics and deep inference on the logic side, and =
regular chains, cylindrical algebraic decomposition and monotone sets on =
the algebra/geometry side.

Last year three new PhD students joined us, each fully covered by a =
scholarship, from the University of Cambridge, ETH Zurich and Universit=E9=
  Paris VII. Our group is very well financed via several grants. Thanks =
to our international relations, working with us means having a truly =
multicultural experience together with all the researchers at the =
forefront of this worldwide research effort. As a result, all our =
graduates work and publish at the highest level. The facilities at the =
University of Bath are outstanding and the city is so beautiful that =
UNESCO recognises it as a World Heritage Site.

The best applicants who are nationals from outside the European Union =
will be considered for some of ten "50th Anniversary Excellence =
Studentships for Overseas Research Students". The scholarships cover the =
full overseas fee, a stipend and a training support grant for three =
years. In other words, if you manage to win one of these scholarships =
you will be able to obtain an excellent PhD and maintain yourself =
without the need for any extra money. To be considered you need to apply =
before the deadline indicated above.

There will be other scholarships, for which the deadline above does not =
apply, that will cover all or part of the tuition fees. The details of =
these scholarships will be known later in the year, but you can apply =
and indicate if you need financial support right now.

To obtain more information and to apply, please follow the link above =
and choose the PhD programme in Computer Science. Feel free to contact =
Alessio Guglielmi (A.Guglielmi AT Bath.Ac.UK) for any questions about a =
PhD in Proofs, Categories and Semantics, or contact James Davenport =
(J.H.Davenport AT Bath.Ac.UK) for a PhD in Geometry and Computer =
Algebra.
