Hi,

This is a beginner's question. I have a textbook (Walters) that asks to =
show that there are exactly 11 categories with 3 arrows.

Now, my logic tells me that I need to cover three possibilities:

a) One object with three arrows. How many are there of these?

b) Two objects with three arrows. How many are there of these?

c) Three objects with three arrows. I think that the answer to this is =
the easiest. The answer is 1 categories because they are all =
endomorphisms, each object containing just the identity morphism.

So the other 10 arrows must come from a) and b), but I keep getting =
different answers like 12 and 13 categories as the total.

Can someone please explain to me the combinations of categories that =
need to be covered and why some are missed out during the calculation.

Any help would be immensely appreciated.

Thanks,

Mark Spezzano=
