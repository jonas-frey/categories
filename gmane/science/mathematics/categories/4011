Perhaps all the categorists who insist on toposes instead of topoi will
teach their
lower division students about coordinate axises and look forward to
greeting them when they
return to the university as alumnuses?  (Naturally if they do this they
will omit the diaresis from the
second o in coordinate.)

(Sorry to be contrarian, but I've always been fond of the Greek plural,
and the
diaresis on the o in co\"{o}rdinate.)

Best Thoughts,
David Y.
