The Verification Research Group is offering two D.Phil studentships in Ox=
ford=20
University's Computing Laboratory (web.comlab.ox.ac.uk).  These positions=
 are=20
associated with the EPSRC project "Model Checking Real-Time Systems: Algo=
rithms=20
and Complexity'' under the supervision of Dr James Worrell, which will de=
al=20
with a logical and automata-theoretic framework for model checking real-t=
ime=20
systems.

The studentships are fully funded at EU fees level (non-EU candidates wil=
l need=20
supplementary funding) for 3 =C2=BD years from 1st October 2009. Students=
 admitted
with a later start date (but not later than April 1st 2010) will receive =
a=20
guarantee of 3 years funding.  Each studentship includes a stipend of at =
least=20
=C2=A313290 per year as well as provision for travel to conferences.

The studentships will suit candidates with a strong background in theoret=
ical=20
computer science, including at least one of the following areas: algorith=
ms,=20
automata theory, complexity theory and logic.

Please contact James Worrell (jbw@comlab.ox.ac.uk) for further details.
