Two PhD student positions will soon be available to work under the direction
of Bartek Klin in the Institute of Informatics, University of Warsaw.

The positions are in the field of semantics of programming
languages and process algebras, in connection to the project
"Modular operational semantics: a bialgebraic approach", funded
by the Polish National Science Center. The applicants should have
solid background in Mathematics and Computer Science, and
be interested in topics such as semantics of programming languages,
category theory, process algebra, formal methods.

The positions will be available from October 2013. Interested
candidates should apply for a PhD fellowship at the Warsaw Center
of Mathematics and Computer Science (http://www.wcmcs.edu.pl/node/38),
with the deadline of

*** June 7th, 2013 ***.

A successful candidate will earn 5000PLN(~1200EUR)/month
(3500PLN tax-free from the WCMCS fellowship + 1500PLN pre-tax funded
by the research project), subject to yearly evaluation of progress.
The positions are associated with teaching duties of up to 60 hours/year.

Any queries about the positions should be addressed to Bartek Klin,
klin@mimuw.edu.pl .
