Dear categorists,=0A=0Asuppose V is a monoidal category, with underlying ca=
tegory V_0, and X is an ordinary category. Then (if I am not mistaken) the =
functor category V_0^X has a monoidal structure, defined point-wise by that=
  of V and each functor f:X->Y gives a strong monoidal functor.=0A=0AFirst q=
uestion : supposing V closed, under which hypothesis is V_0^X closed as wel=
l (as in the case V =3D Set)?=0A=0ASecond question: supposing that V_0^X is=
  indeed closed and that V is suitably complete, so that reindexing along f =
has a right adjoint forall_f, then V_0^X is enriched over V by forall_X(A->=
B). How is this enrichment related to the usual one of [X,v]  when X is a V=
-category?=0A=0ABest regards,=0A=0AClaudio=0A=0A
