Dear Colleagues,
   Below is the first Call for Papers for MFPS 25, which will be held =20=

at Oxford, UK from April 3 - 7, 2009. We encourage submissions in all =20=

areas relating to the topics of the meeting.
   Best regards,
   Mike MIslove

		  FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

			        MFPS XXV
	    http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps25

		   Twenty-fifth Conference on the
		     Mathematical Foundations of
			Programming Semantics

		            University of Oxford
			          Oxford, UK
                            April 3 - 7, 2009

	  Partially Supported by US Office of Naval Research


In commemoration of the founding of denotational semantics in the work =20=

of Dana Scott and Christopher Strachey, the Twenty-fifth Conference on =20=

the Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics will take place =20=

on the campus of the University of Oxford, Oxford UK from April 3 - 7, =20=

2009. MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, =20
logic, and computer science that are related to models of computation, =20=

in general, and to the semantics of programming languages, in =20
particular. The series has particularly stressed providing a forum =20
where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and =20
exchange ideas about problems of common interest. As the series also =20
strives to maintain breadth in its scope, the conference strongly =20
encourages participation by researchers in neighboring areas.

TOPICS include, but are not limited to, the following: biocomputation; =20=

concurrent and distributed computation; constructive mathematics; =20
domain theory and categorical models; formal languages; formal =20
methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; logic; probabilistic =20
systems; process calculi; programming-language theory; quantum =20
computation; security; topological models; type systems; type theory.

The INVITED SPEAKERS for MFPS XXV are

Neil Ghani, Strathclyde
Marta Kwiatkowska, Oxford
Catherine Meadows, Naval Research Lab
Michael Mislove, Tulane
Dana Scott, CMU
David Schmidt, Kansas State

In addition, there will be four SPECIAL SESSIONS:

- A Session Honoring Bob Tennent on the occasion of his 65th birthday =20=

year, which is being organized by Dan Ghica (Birmingham) and Pete =20
O'Hearn (QMW).

- A Session on Security will be held in conjunction with Catherine =20
Meadow's plenaary talk. It is being organized by Catherine Meadows  =20
and A. W. Roscoe (Oxford).

- A Session Honoring Michael Mislove on the occasion of his 65th =20
birthday year, which is being organized by Achim Jung (Birmingham), =20
Samson Abramsky (Oxford) and Steve Brookes (CMU). It will be held in =20
conjunction with Dana Scott's plenary address.

- A Session on Mathematical Structured Programming will be held in =20
conjunction with Neil Ghani's plenary address. It is being organized =20
by Neil Ghani and Achim Jung.

In addition, there will be five TUTORIAL TALKS on Quantum Information =20=

and Quantum Computing. These are being organized by Samson Abramsky =20
(Oxford) and Bob Coecke (Oxford).  The talks will be given at the =20
start of each day of the meeting. These talks are aimed at providing =20
background for participants to take part in the Workshop on Quantum =20
Physics and Logic (QPL VI) immediately following MFPS in Oxford.

The remainder of the program will consist of papers selected by the
following PROGRAM COMMITTEE
