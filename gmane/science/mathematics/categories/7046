Dear David,

There are many possible meanings of partial morphism between categories,
depending on  what meaning you attach to "subcategory". Different =
meanings
will be appropriate depending on the applications in question.

One possibility, which I believe was first considered by Lawvere, is to =
take "subcategory"=20
of C to be a discrete opfibration over C. The resulting 2-category is =
described in=20
detail in the appendix of=20

Stephen Lack and Ross Street, The formal theory of monads II, JPAA =
175:243-265, 2002.

where it is also shown that these partial maps are classified, in a =
suitable sense,
by the Fam construction.=20

Regards,

Steve Lack.
