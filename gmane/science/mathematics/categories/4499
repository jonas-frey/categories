One amusing thing about the tricategory of spans in a
2-category, with composition by iso-comma object, is that it
is barely a tricategory. Binary composition is associative up
to iso; it is only the unitality which is really up to
equivalence. Something similar happens if you define a
tricategory of biprofunctors.
