Yes, there it is!  That's what I get for not reading them in order.  (^_^)

I was about to say that this comparison is not really fair,
since N is the initial algebra of X |-> X + 1,
while 2^N is the final coalgebra of X |-> 2 x X,
but I guess that the final coalgebra of X |-> X + 1
is also overt but not discrete.

Perhaps the asymmetry is simply between initial algebras and final colagebras.
One is a colimit and the other is a limit;
there are already several asymmetries between these,
such as that products distribute over sums but not vice versa.
Indeed, if final coalgebras preserve "some"s,
this might be more than just a bad pun.
