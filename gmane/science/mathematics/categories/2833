Presumably I was considered North American at the time as the Bowdoin
Seminar came between a postdoc at U Illinois (Champ-Urb) and a assistant
professorship at Tulane. Sammy commented that I began the summer as an
Australian and ended up an all American boy. Sammy was prone to
exaggeration.

I have wonderful memories of that summer:

     Mac  Lane's incredible lectures (every morning -- 2 hours I
     think -- for the whole summer),
     freezing water at the beach although the weather was hot,
     the "pro-seminars" run by new postdocs that were organized after
     Mac Lane's first lecture,
     becoming marooned when the tide came in and Eduardo Dubuc (up to
     his chest in water) carried Joan Machez (sp?) while I supported her
     broken leg in its cast,
     the tall dormitory with 16 bedrooms per level and Sammy at the
     top in the penthouse,
     that clam and lobster bake,
     buying beer at the supermarket where the under-aged checkout
     girl had to get an older person to punch in the price of the beer!

     and many other things mathematical and non.

Mac Lane, Dubuc, Duskin and I moved down to Tulane after that for its
"Year on Category Theory 1969-70".
