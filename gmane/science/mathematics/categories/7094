I don=92t know the full history of this idea; I came across it in the 
work =
of
Marco Grandis on directed homotopy, such as
http://www.dima.unige.it/~grandis/LCat.pdf

Grandis considers a generalisation of bicategories, rather than monoidal
categories, but of course the monoidal version is the special case of a
bicategory with a single object.

Actually Grandis has the maps you call eta and eps going the other way, so
perhaps the precise notion you=92re describing is more closely related to
Burroni=92s 1971 notion of =91pseudocategory=92.

Anyway I expect some of the more knowledgeable members of this list will be
able to give you a better answer!

All the best,
Robin
