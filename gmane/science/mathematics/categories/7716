Dear all,

This is a reminder that if you wish to take advantage of the extended 1
June deadline for submitting abstracts to CT2013, you are requested to
email me **by 10 May** saying that you intend to submit an abstract.
This is to help with planning.

Abstracts received after 10 May will not be accepted unless you have
emailed before then.  I am acknowledging all such emails, so if you have
written to me and not received a reply, there has probably been a
technological problem - in which case, please try again.

Best wishes,
Tom

Dear all,

The original deadline for submitting abstracts to Category Theory 2013
(Macquarie University, Sydney) was 1 May.

This has now been extended to 1 June.  However, if you have not already
submitted an abstract and intend to do so, please email me by 10 May
declaring your intention to submit.

Abstracts themselves should be submitted via the conference website,

     http://web.science.mq.edu.au/groups/coact/seminar/ct2013/

Best wishes,
Tom Leinster (on behalf of the scientific committee)
