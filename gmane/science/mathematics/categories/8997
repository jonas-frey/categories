Dear Marta and Steve,

    I'm not at all a specialist in topos theory, and learned about them
quite late when I was already engaged in algebraic topology ... but let
me give an "external" point of view on the subject.

    I believe that Grothendieck did never have the "modern point of view"
of elementary toposes, but he always thought of a topos as being a
category of sheaves on a site. For instance, in "Pursuing Stacks" he
calls the subobject classifier the "Lawvere object" and he uses the
latter with homotopical purposes (as a good interval object) but he
never uses it as a foudational structure for defining a topos.
Therefore, I find it a little artificial to employ the term
"Grothendieck topos" in contexts where the topos cannot be represented
as a category of sheaves on a site. It might of course be possible to
give a sense ``internal to a given elementary topos S'' of what it means
to be a category of sheaves on a site, but this is beyond my competence.

    Working over S=Sets I always found it quite nice that Grothendieck
toposes can be characterized among elementary toposes as those which are
accessible, because this gives in a very precise sense what is needed in
order to represent the elementary topos as a category of sheaves on a
site. Moreover, there is an analogous characterization of accessible
quasi-toposes due to Borceux et al.

    Of course, when working over an arbitrary elementary topos S, one
should define what it means to be S-accessible, but I guess that this
has already been done.

    All the best,
                  Clemens.
