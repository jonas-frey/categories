Hello,
 	Details of a part of John and Mike's post can be found in one of
my publications.

Theorem. 9.17
Let X and A be strict 2-categories, and G:A -> X a pseudo functor. There
exists a left biadjoint for G if and only if for every object x of X there
exists an object r of A and a biuniversal arrow x -> Gr from x to G.

The proof is as one could expect.
