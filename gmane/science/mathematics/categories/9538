Dear Steve,

Curiously enough, what you describe about how to get a point of MX (a coshe=
af, or distribution) is precisely what did in 1990.  I communicated it priv=
ately to Lawvere at Como 1990, as he was the one who had left the question =
as an open one. My method to do that was that of "forcing topologies" (Tier=
ney)and not unlike what is done in the Joyal-Tierney paper except for forge=
tting the lex part. Unfortunately, when I sent a paper "Cosheaves and distr=
ibutions on toposes" containing this result to Peter Freyd for the JPAA, wh=
oever refereed it rejected it without giving a reason, but I know that it w=
as my fault as the paper was not too clearly written. I subsequently sent i=
t to Algebra Universalis where it did appear (same title and alas, still no=
t too clearly written) but very much later (1995).

That sabbatical year 1995-96 I was spent at the Universita di Genova where =
(not coincidentally) Aurelio (Carboni) had just taken a job away from Milan=
. Aurelio immediately understood my construction, but thought that it would=
  be "wiser" to set it in algebraic terms. This resulted in our joint paper =
"The symmetric topos", which this time it did appear in JPAA (1995). We did=
  more than that in that paper, namely to extend it to a KZ-monad and charac=
terize its algebras. I therefore abandoned the fibrational point of view wh=
ich, as you say, found its way again in my work with Jonathon (Funk) as the=
  complete spreads with a locally connected domain. However, just this morni=
ng (and before reading what you just wrote) I was thinking of using the fib=
rational approach again for constructing the topos NX corresponding to the =
upper power locale, just as the topos MX corresponds to the lower power loc=
ale.=20

It seems to me now that modulo some differences this is what you are trying=
  to do yourself. Of course it would be "wiser" as Aurelio would have said, =
to do it "algebraically" and this is what I did for the coherent monad in m=
y "Pitts paper" (2015). So I am pursuing that line as well. I will read the=
  rest of your message later and maybe respond to your question about it pri=
vately. It may take a few days as other things are interfering with my work=
  at present.=20

Many thanks for your remarks.=20

All the best,
Marta    =20

Dear Marta,

Here's my thinking on connected components.

For M, the paradigm example for how to get a point of MX (a cosheaf, or dis=
tribution) is to take locally connected space Y with map p: Y -> X, and the=
n to each sheaf U over X assign the set of connected components of p*U. Thi=
s gives a covariant functor from SX to Set, and it preserves colimits. If X=
  is an ungeneralized space, then it suffices to do that for opens U, and th=
e extension to sheaves follows. Your theory of complete spreads shows that =
that paradigm example is in fact general.

The extreme case of p is when X is itself locally connected and we can take=
  p to be the identity. The corresponding cosheaf is terminal in a strong se=
nse: as global point of MX it provides a right adjoint to the map MX -> 1. =
The unit of the adjunction provides a unique morphism from the generic cosh=
eaf to the terminal one.

If X is exponentiable, then (always? In favourable cases?) the cosheaf as d=
escribed above can be got by taking points for a map R^X -> R, where R is (=
following your notation) the object classifier. This points out Lawvere's a=
nalogy with integration, where R would be the real line. Then just as Riesz=
  picks out the linear functionals as the distributions, we are interested i=
n the colimit-preserving ones.

In the above account, the role of local connectedness is to ensure that the=
  connected components genuinely do form a set, a discrete space. What happe=
ns if we look for a Stone space instead? Here is my conjecture.

1. For ungeneralized X we should be looking for a Stone space of connected =
components of p*U for each _closed_ U. Y will need a suitable condition (st=
rongly compact?) as analogue of local compactness. (By Stone duality that c=
ould also be expressed by assigning (covariantly) a Boolean algebra to each=
  open.)

2. Noting that a closed embedding is fibrewise Stone, that assignment will =
extend to U an arbitrary fibrewise Stone (entire) bundle over X - that is t=
o say, by Stone duality and contravariantly, a sheaf of Boolean algebras.

3. For generalized X that will provide our Stone notion of cosheaf. The ass=
ignment from entire bundles to Stone spaces should preserve finite colimits=
  and cofiltered limits. There's an obvious technical hurdle of how to expre=
ss that directly in terms of sheaves instead of entire bundles.

4. If X is exponentiable then this time, by Stone duality, we are looking f=
or maps [BA]^X -> [BA] where [BA] is the classifier for Boolean algebras. T=
hey must preserve filtered colimits (automatic for maps) and finite limits.=
  NX would exist for arbitrary X, and classify those maps.=20

Obviously there's lots to go wrong there, but do you think your coherent mo=
nad fits any of those points for coherent X?

By the way, although I haven't mention the effective lax descent and relati=
vely tidy maps, I am interested in them. They are connected with stable com=
pactness and Priestley duality.

All the best,
