   * Presentation of 31 papers including the CADE-24 Best Paper Award
     winner (details at http://www.cade-24.info/)

   * Tutorials:
     * Franz Baader: Reasoning in Lightweight Description Logics
     * Bernhard Beckert: Program Verification with the KeY System
     * Morgan Deters, Dejan Jovanovic, Clark Barrett and Cesare Tinelli:
       Becoming a Power User of SMT: The CVC4 Solver
     * Marijn Heule: State-of-the-art SAT Solving
     * Carsten Schuermann, Taus Brock-Nannestad and Chris Martens: Twelf

   * Several Workshops (details at http://www.cade-24.info/)

     organized by Geoff Sutcliffe

   During the conference, the Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions
   to Automated Reasoning will be presented to Greg Nelson for his invention
   of equality sharing, also known as the Nelson-Oppen method, and his
   pioneering work on theorem proving and program checking, including fast
   congruence closure algorithms and the Simplify theorem prover.
