> Dear colleagues and friends,

> This is quite a shock to me. I regret not having visited him when Bob (Wal=
ters) and Aurelio himself encouraged me to do so. There was so much I wanted=
  to discuss with him. I will always remember Aurelio as a great collaborator=
  for his kindness, mathematical insights, and humor. He was a good friend as=
  well. My sabbatical in Genova was very special because of Marco, Pino, and A=
urelio. My condolences to the categories group.=20
