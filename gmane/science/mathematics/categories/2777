                        *** CALL FOR PAPERS ***
                        ***********************



BACKGROUND AND SCOPE
====================

In connection with

	       The Second Workshop on Automated Reasoning
		     for Security Protocol Analysis
			       (ARSPA'05)

which took place as a satellite event of ICALP'05, we are guest-editing
a Special Issue of Theoretical Computer Science devoted to original
papers on formal security protocol specification, analysis and
verification.

Contributions are welcomed on the following topics and related ones:

- Automated analysis and verification of security protocols.
- Languages, logics, and calculi for the design and specification of
  security protocols.
- Verification methods: accuracy, efficiency.
- Decidability and complexity of cryptographic verification problems.
- Synthesis and composition of security protocols.
- Integration of formal security specification, refinement and
  validation techniques in development methods and tools.



SUBMISSION
==========

Authors should submit their papers electronically, in portable
document format (pdf) or postscript (ps), by sending an email with
subject "TCS submission" to the address
                        arspa -at- avispa-project.org
with the file of the paper as an attachment, by November 13, 2005.
The following information should be included in the body of the email,
in plain text:
  - paper title
  - author names
  - coordinates of the corresponding author
  - abstract of the paper
The cover page of the submission should also include this information.

Authors are strongly encouraged to use Elsevier Science's document class
'elsart', or alternatively the standard document class 'article'.  The
Elsevier LaTeX package (including detailed instructions for LaTeX
preparation) can be obtained from Elsevier's web site:

Submitted papers must be original and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. The submitted papers will be subject to the standard journal
refereeing process.

We kindly ask the authors to send us an abstract of their submission by
November 6, 2005.
