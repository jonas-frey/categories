Dear Jonathan and David,

Thanks for your answers  and the references. This notion is what
appeared naturally in our setting so it's nice to know that people
have worked on it. We would very much like to hear more about what you
(Jonathan) are working on in this respect.

Sorry for the late letter but I had very bad internet access in the last we=
ek.
Best,
Adam

However, to elaborate on David Roberts's answer, in my work about the homot=
opy theory of 2-categories, the property which I have found the most useful=
  (and which shows up in many natural circonstances) is the following. Given=
  a 2-category A, let us say that an object z of A has a terminal object if =
Hom(a,z) has a terminal object for every object a of A. This terminology wa=
s suggested to me by Jean B=C3=A9nabou. It is of course compatible with the=
  usual definition if the 2-category happens to be Cat. It can be shown that=
, if a small 2-category A admits such an object, then the map from A to the=
  point is a weak equivalence, i.e. its nerve is a simplicial weak equivalen=
ce. I have some papers around related stuff, which I could communicate when=
  they are in their final version.
