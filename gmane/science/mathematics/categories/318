SCOPE

This meeting aims at a general understanding of the interconnections
and relations between formal systems, ranging from programming
languages for concurrency to logics. More specifically, we consider
methods to compare concurrent programming concepts, such as imperative
programming, logic programming, functional programming, concurrent
programming, object-oriented programming, dataflow, and the various
combinations thereof, on the basis of their relative expressive
power. We also consider associated mathematical formalisms such as
process algebras, Petri nets, modal logics, rewrite systems etc. from
this point of view.

The meeting is mainly intended for active researchers to get together
and discuss their latest results and methods. It is also the final
meeting of the HCM project EXPRESS, which has been active with this
focus since 1994.

VENUE

The conference will take place at Hotel Regina Elena in Santa
Margherita Ligure. This is a 4 stars hotel with private beach and
conference facilities, which will also provide accommodation for most
of the participants. Santa Margherita Ligure is a beautiful sea resort
in Liguria, on the Riviera di Levante. It is very close to Portofino
promontory and about 30 km east of Genova. The nearest international
airport is in Genova with direct connections to Zurich, Paris, London,
Munich and other European towns. Between Santa Margherita Ligure and
Genova there are good train connections.
