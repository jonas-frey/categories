Hi Fosco Loregian,

I suppose that my thesis must be stored in microfilm at the University of P=
ennsylvania. I only have my own copy and never bothered to try to obtain on=
e such.

In Research Gate (my page) I uploaded portions of a couple of chapters for =
specific reasons, one on Regular Categories (my version which includes exac=
tness conditions but not stability) and another on Adoint Functors (between=
  such categories of =93presheaves=94). I did not publish my 1966 thesis as =
such, but at least a relative (to a symmetric monoidal category) version of=
   the characterization theorem was included in my 1969 Journal of Algebra p=
aper and communicated by Saunders MacLane.

That is all I have. In those days it was not customary to post electronic v=
ersions. My own thesis was typed by myself in a typewriter with symbols ins=
erted by hand.

Is there anything specific you would like to have or know?

Regards,
Marta Bunge

Hello everyone!

I was wondering: is there any chance to find an electronic copy of Marta
Bunge's PhD thesis

"Categories of Set-Valued Functors", University of Pennsylvania, 1966

Best,
Fosco Loregian
