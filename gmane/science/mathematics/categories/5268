Sorry.  I did misunderstand that.  But I still do not understand it.

What is a "formal basis" of a theory T?  Is any subtheory of T?  Or is
it any conceptually significant subtheory?  (In the latter case I
would not call it a "formal" basis.)

Is it supposed to be a general rule that if a theory T has a "formal
basis" then T cannot be a satisfactory foundation?

The Eilenberg-MacLane axioms are a subtheory of CCAF and also have a
natural, conceptually central interpretation in CCAF.  I consider this
an insight, Bill's insight, and I do not see how it becomes any kind
of objection to CCAF.

best, Colin
