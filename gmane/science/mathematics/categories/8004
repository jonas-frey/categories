Almost two decades ago I studied Type Theory in Uruguay on a course
organized, if I remember correctly, by Gustavo Betarte and Alvaro
Tasistro. In those times we used

"Programming in Martin Lof type theory" by Nordstrom.

I don't know if this is still considered to be the best introduction.
In any case, anyone interested in Type Theory may also be interested
in a 2000 document made recently available by Bob Walters in

http://rfcwalters.blogspot.com.ar/2013/10/interview-with-bill-lawvere-by-felice.html

It contains historical information that I am pretty sure is not
available in other sources and that should help any newcomer to
understand Type Theory in a broader categorical context.
