FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

12th International Conference on
Software Engineering and Formal Methods
(SEFM 2014)

http://sefm2014.inria.fr/

Grenoble, France
September 1-5, 2014

####################################################################

The aim of the conference is to bring together practitioners and
researchers from academia, industry and government to advance the
state of the art in formal methods, to scale up their application in
the software industry and to encourage their integration with
practical engineering methods. Papers that apply formal methods to
software engineering are especially welcome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Important Dates

Abstract Submission: March 14, 2014
Paper Submission: March 21, 2014 (AoE)
Notification: May 19, 2014
Camera Ready: June 13, 2014

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Topics of Interest

The topics of this conference include, but are not limited to:

- Formal requirement analysis, modeling, specification and design
- Abstraction and refinement
- Formal methods for probabilistic verification and synthesis
- Programming languages, program analysis and type theory
- Formal methods for self-adaptive systems, service-oriented and cloud computing
- Formal aspects of security and mobility
- Model checking, theorem proving and decision procedures
- Formal methods for real-time, hybrid and embedded systems
- Formal methods for safety-critical, fault-tolerant and secure systems
- Software architecture and coordination languages
- Software verification and validation
- Component, object and multi-agent systems
- Formal aspects of software evolution and maintenance
- Formal methods for testing, re-engineering and reuse
- Light-weight and scalable formal methods
- Tool integration
- Applications of formal methods, industrial case studies and technology transfer
- Education and formal methods

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Submission and Publication

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the
program committee. They will be evaluated on the basis of originality,
contribution to the field, technical and presentation quality, and
relevance to the conference.

Papers should conform to the Springer LNCS style and should describe,
in English, original work that has not been published or submitted for
publication elsewhere. PDF versions of papers should be submitted
electronically via EasyChair:

https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=sefm2014

We solicit two categories of papers:

- Research papers should describe fully developed work and should not
exceed 15 pages (including appendices). Authors of papers reporting
experimental work are strongly encouraged to make their experimental
results available to reviewers. Case study papers should describe
significant case studies and lessons learned.

- Tool papers should describe an operational tool and its
contributions. Tool papers should not exceed 6 pages. Please include
the URL of the tool (if available).

Two additional pages of appendices are allowed that will not be
included in the proceedings. The proceedings of SEFM'14 will be
published by Springer Verlag in the LNCS series. After the conference,
authors of selected papers will be invited to submit an extended
version of their work to be considered for publication in a relevant
journal.
