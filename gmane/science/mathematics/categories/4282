I'm not familiar with that particular result, but I know other
categorical proofs which use set-theoretic ideas like transfinite
induction, and so cannot be detached from ZF in an obvious way.  On
the other hand, there is nothing intrinsically "membership-based" in
transfinite induction.  The problem seems to be the lack of a
categorical analogue of ZF's axiom of replacement, since the sets in
V_{\omega+\omega} already form a well-pointed elementary topos with a
NNO.  I find this especially mysterious because on the surface,
replacement merely replaces a set by an isomorphic one (or at most a
quotient)!

One categorical analogue of replacement comes from categories of classes in
algebraic set theory.  That is, we move from a categorical analogue of ZF
to an analogue of Godel-Bernays set theory.  But it seems natural to wonder
whether there could be a categorical analogue of replacement expressible
solely as a property of the category Set, without reference to how it sits
in a category of classes.  Has anyone studied this question?
