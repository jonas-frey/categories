Dear Andr=E9

Your guess is quite correct. More generally every full and faithful =
functor is a foliation.=20
Let me call a functor P: X --> S locally full and faithful (lff)  iff =
for each object  x of X the obvious functor  X/x --> S/P(x)  is full and =
faithful. Such functors are also characterized by :  Every map of X is =
hypercartesian.  Thus they are foliatiions. Now every full and faithful =
functor is lff. Hence is a foliation.
I mentioned in my mail that there are many foliations which are not =
fibrations, this is a typical example. It shows how much more general =
than (pre) fibrations  (pre) foliations can be.
To give an easy but important application, let me note that, if X is a =
groupoid avery functor  P: X --> S, where S is arbitrary, is a =
foliation, because all the maps of X are isos, hence hypercartesian.

This gives me the opportunity to explain condition (ii) for cartesian =
functors in a special case. Suppose
P: X --> S,  P' :  X' --> S and F; X --> X'  verify  P =3D P'F,  where =
X, X'  and S are groups. Then P and P' are foliations and F preserves =
cartesian maps. However F need not be cartesian. More precisely F =
satisfies (ii) iff P and P' have same image in S. In that case the =
theorem says:  F is a mono (resp an epi)  iff its  restriction  Ker(P) =
--> Ker(P') is a mono (resp an epi). This would be obviously false =
without (ii)=20
To complete the picture let us see that  (i) =3D> (ii)  when P is a =
fibration. In that case P is surjective, i.e. Im(P) =3D S  contains =
Im(P') . But  P =3D P'F =3D> Im(P) is contained in Im(P'), hence the =
equality required.

Thank you for having given me the occasion to explicit some examples, an =
in particular to show that (ii) is meaningful.

Bien amicalement,
Jean
