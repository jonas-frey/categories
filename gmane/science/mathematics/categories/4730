On the subject of the ISI citation index, I wonder if what is being=20=20=
=0A=
done is consistent with anti-trust laws in the USA and with fair=20=20=0A=
competition laws in the EU. The refusal of Thomson's to accept=20=20=0A=
reputable journals and also to justify their refusal looks to me to be=20=
=20=0A=
suspect on legal grounds.  Does any one know of any legal challenges=20=20=
=0A=
to this.=0A=
