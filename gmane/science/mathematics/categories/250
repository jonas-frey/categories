Hi,

The following paper is very clear, I'm currently learning the basics =20
of the subject with it: http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~maltsin/ps/=20
asphbl.ps. It's written in French. Another member of this mailing-=20
list has asked me to translate it in English, I may be able to send =20
you a rough translation in a few weeks.

Best,

Jonathan
