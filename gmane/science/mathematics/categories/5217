Dear category theorists,

I invite everyone to read the interesting interview of Yuri Manin=20
published in the November issue of the Notices of the AMS:

http://www.ams.org/notices/200910

http://www.ams.org/notices/200910/rtx091001268p.pdf

One the ideas discussed by Manin is that of a "pragmatic foundation" of
mathematics as opposed to a "normative foundation" by logicists or =
constructivists.=20
He attributes the former to Bourbaki.

I disagree.

The foundational framework of Bourbaki is very much in the tradition=20
of Zermelo-Fraenkel, Godel-Bernays and Russell.
I am aware that Bourbaki was more interested in the development of=20
mathematics than in its foundation.=20
My guess is that the foundation was too problematic to be given a =
proeminent place=20
in the treaty, not for logical reasons but for conceptual reasons.
I claim that nobody truly understand set theory, even today!
The emperor has no clothes!
I mean that the hierarchy of infinite cardinals is so profoundly =
mysterious=20
that it looks pathological.
What is the value of a theory if it leads to meaningless problems and =
structures?=20
Having no good answer to offer, Bourbaki decided to diminish the =
importance of=20
foundation rather than leaving it open.=20
It may explain why category theory was not incorporated in the =
foundation later.

In the interview, Manin also said that:

>And so I don=92t foresee anything extraordinary=20
>in the next twenty years. Probably, a rebuilding of=20
>what I call the =93pragmatic foundations of math-=20
>ematics=94 will continue. By this I mean simply a=20
>codification of efficient new intuitive tools, such=20
>as Feynman path integrals, higher categories, the=20
>=93brave new algebra=94 of homotopy theorists, as=20
>well as emerging new value systems and accepted=20
>forms of presenting results that exist in the minds=20
>and research papers of working mathematicians=20
>here and now, at each particular time.=20

Any comments?
