In a previous mail I said that I was strongly opposed to the=20
replacement of "cartesian" and "co-cartesian" maps by "prone" and=20
"supine" ones for linguistic, mathematical and ethical reasons which I=20=

was ready to explain in detail if I was asked to do so.
I have waited a few days to see what reactions I  would get. So far, my=20=

position has been supported by Peter May and Eduardo Dubuc on ethical=20
and/or linguistic grounds, and Keith Harbaugh has asked me what=20
"ethical"  issue is involved, and more generally to clarify my position=20=

on the mailing list.

Although the ethical issues are for me the most important, I shall=20
postpone them to another mail, if the moderator of this list permits me=20=

to do so, and I shall concentrate to-day on the mathematical an=20
linguistic reasons of my opposition.
I am no linguist, but I am a mathematician, so THE MATHEMATICS WILL=20
COME FIRST, and I would like to make this  text more "palatable" and=20
less "negative" by introducing some genuinely new ideas, which some of=20=

you might find of interest, and which are relevant in this debate.

=A71- DEFINITIONS

Let  P: C ---> B  be a a functor.
1.1-  A map v of C is VERTICAL (forP)   if  P(v) is an identity. I=20
denote by  V(P) or simply V the subcategory of  C which has the same=20
objects as C and as maps the vertical ones.
Every identity is vertical, and if in a commutative triangle in C two=20
of the maps are vertical so is the third.

1.2- Let f be a map f of C. We shall say that f  is :
(i)  CARTESIAN if for every pair (g,b) with g in C , b in B,  and=20
P(g)=3DP(f).b there exists a unique map h in C such that:   P(h)=3Db  =
and =20
g=3Df.h.
(ii)  PRECARTESIAN If the previous condition is satisfied only when b=20
is an identity,
(iii)  HORIZONTAL if every vertical map is orthogonal to f . (that=20
would probably be "prone" in the proposed new terminology)
I shall denote by  K(P), PreK(P) and H(P) the classes of maps of C=20
which are cartesian, precartesian and horizontal, and abbreviate by K,=20=

PreK,  and H  if  P  is fixed.


1.3 - The functor P is a fibration (resp. a PREFIBRATION)  if for every=20=

pair (b,X) where b is a map of B, and X an object of C and=20
P(X)=3DCodom(b)  there exists a cartesian (resp.precartesian) map f: Y=20=

--->X  such that  P(f)=3Db


1.4 - If X is an object of C and  b: J--->P(X)  we denote Pl(b,X) the=20
category of  P-LIFTINGS of b with codomain X with objects the maps f:=20
Y--->X  of C such that  P(f)=3Db, a morphism from f to f': Y'--->X  is a=20=

vertical map  v: Y--->Y'  such that  f.v=3Df' .
I shall say that P is a HOMOTOPY PREFIBRATION if all the categories =20
Pl(b,X) are connected (which of course imply non empty), the motivation=20=

of the name is that any two liftings are "homotopic".

1.5 - Let  P: C --->  B  and  P': C' ---> B  be two functors and  F; C=20=

---> C'  be a functor over B i.e. such that P'.F=3DP. Such an F =
obviously=20
preserves and reflects vertical maps for P and P'. Moreover if f: Y=20
--->X is in Pl(b,X) , F(f): F(Y) ---> F(X) is in P'l(b,F(X))  hence F=20
induces functors
           Fl(b,X): Pl(b,X) --->P'l(b,F(X)) , f  l--->F(f)  , for all=20
"compatible" pairs (b,X)
I shall say that F is a CARTESIAN FUNCTOR if all the functors Fl(b,X)=20
are final. (No assumption is made on  P  or P').

=A72-REMARKS "EN VRAC" ABOUT THESE DEFINITIONS (or, let's do a little =
bit=20
of mathematics!)

2.1- Let P: C --->B be a functor  (we assume NOTHING on P) Then:
(i) Every cartesian map is horizontal i.e. K(P) is contained in H(P).
The converse need not be true, for example if all vertical maps are=20
iso's i.e. all the fibers of P are groupo=EFds, then all maps of C are=20=

horizontal, and "co-horizontal" And one can construct a P where C and B=20=

are finite posets where no map, except of course the identities, is=20
pre-cartesian or pre-cocartesian, let alone cartesian or cocartesian
(ii) THEOREM. If P is a homotopy- prefibration, then cartesian=20
coincides with horizontal, i.e.  H(P)=3DK(p).
(It is not completely trivial)

The definitions 1.4 and 1.5 are genuinely new, and might seem=20
surprising, the following remarks will give a very small idea of what=20
can be done with them

2.2- A cartesian functor preserves precartesian maps :
Because f: Y --->X is in  PreK(P)  iff it is a final object of =20
Pl(P(f),X) , and final functors preserve final objects

However if P and P' are are arbitrary functors such a preservation is=20
not enough to insure that F is cartesian because there might not be=20
"enough" precartesian maps in C. But cartesian functors have so far=20
NEVER been used except between prefibrations, and in that  case our=20
definition coincides with the usual one because we have:

2.3- If P and P' are prefibrations,  F  is cartesian iff  it preserves=20=

precartesian maps.(It suffices in fact that P is a prefibration)

I like to make the following "analogy" : if  S and T are topological=20
spaces a continuous function  f: S --->T preserves convergent=20
sequences, if X is metrisable, this is enough to insure the continuity=20=

of f

2.4 - Cartesian functors are closed under composition, and every=20
equivalence over B is cartesian.
In fact we have much better, namely.

2.5 - If a functor F over B has a left adjoint then F is cartesian

2.6 - Homotopy-prefibrations are stable by composition.
This seems "harmless" and trivial, but it is neither. It is well known=20=

that fibrations are stable by composition, but it is probably a little=20=

less well known, because I have never seen a statement to that effect,=20=

that prefibrations  ARE NOT .

2.7 - Homotopy-prefibrations  (h-p) are special cases of cartesian=20
functors, because P. C --->B  is a h-p iiff it is a cartesian functor:=20=

(C,P) --->(B,IdB).
(This of course is no longer true if h-p is replaced by prefibration or=20=

fibration)
 =46rom this it follows that if  F:(C,P) --->(C',P') is cartesian and  =
P'=20
is a h-p so is  P.

2.8 - An important feature of h-p is that pointwise Kan extensions=20
along such P's can be computed fiberwise. Moreover this property=20
characterizes h-p' s.
In particular such a P is final iff all its fibers are connected, and=20
it is flat iff  it's fibers are cofiltered.
The previous results are special cases of properties true for arbitrary=20=

cartesian functors.


2.9 - REMARK : Homotopy prefibrations are but ONE example of =20
MEANINGFUL generalizations of fibrations. I have considered many=20
others, all with important mathematical examples, here are some: (for a=20=

functor  P: C --->B)
(i) The categories Pl(b,X) are filtered
(ii) Each connected component of such a category has a final object
(iii)  Each connected component is filtered
In (ii) and (ii)  P is not even a homotopy prefibration, but in all=20
these cases the general definition of cartesian functor given in 1.5 =20
is the "correct" one and gives the expected results.


=A73 LINGUISTICO-MATHEMATICAL REMARKS

3.1 - OK, let us try "prone" for "cartesian", what about the=20
precartesian maps, "preprone" ? They have nothing to do with a=20
weakening of orthogonality to V(P), which we shall examine in 3.3. What=20=

about cartesian functors, "prone functors"? What about maps which are=20
both cartesian and cocartesian, such that e.g. the iso's, prone and=20
supine? A very uncomfortable position you'll grant me. I am no acrobat,=20=

I tried it, I hurt my back and stomach, had to stand up, and ended=20
up...vertical!

3.2 - The proposed terminology is based ON A BIG MATHEMATICAL MISTAKE,=20=

namely: confusing cartesian and horizontal, which in general do NOT=20
coincide, as shown in 2.1. Unless of course there no other functors but=20=

fibrations, or if there are, the terminology should not be compatible=20
with them. Well I, and probably other persons, think that there are,=20
know that there are, and that they deserve to be studied, were it only=20=

to have a better understanding of fibrations. In 2.9 I gave a few=20
examples of such functors. If there were ONLY fibrations,  how would=20
one express the fact that a prefibration where all the fibers are=20
groupoids is a fibration?

3.3 - Even for fibrations there are interesting maps which are neither=20=

vertical nor cartesian and that one might want to study. Let me give an=20=

example. Both cartesianness and horizontality assume the existence and=20=

uniqueness of maps satisfying certain conditions. What about those=20
where we drop existence and keep uniqueness.
Following Peter Freyd's suggestion, let me call them=20
quasi-cartesian(QK), and quasi-horizontal(QH),and see what they are. A=20=

map f: Y --->X  is  QK  (rep. QH) iff  for every  parallel pair =20
(g,g'): Z=3D=3D=3D>Y  coequalized by f, if P(g)=3DP(g') (resp.if =
g.v=3Dg'.v for=20
some vertical map v) then g=3Dg'
Even in the case of fibrations, where K=3DH, QK is only contained in QH=20=

but not equal.This can be seen in the most trivial case, where B=3D1, =
and=20
all maps are vertical. A map f is QK iff it is a mono, it is QH iff =20
for every pair of maps (g,g')  WHICH CAN BE EQUALIZED,  fg=3Dfg' implies =
=20
g=3Dg'.
Now if cartesian=3Dprone, QK will have to be "quasi-prone", a strange=20
position again, but never mind. However, how should we call QH ?

3.4- I can speak, read, and write a little bit of English, but I am=20
French and might someday have the preposterous idea to lecture on=20
fibered categories in French.  Of course only in France, and to an=20
audience uniquely composed of french persons. Perhaps MM Taylor and=20
Johnstone, could suggest adequate french translations for prone and=20
supine, which I can't  seem to find. And they should be ready to do the=20=

same thing for German, Italian, Spanish, and many other languages.

No such problems with cartesian of course, because cartesian.... is=20
cartesian  is cartesian is cartesian!

3.5- By now many thousands of pages have been written in various=20
languages using "cartesian", and many hundreds are being prepared, or=20
ready to be published, using the same word. What should be done with=20
all that past or future rubbish, now that we have received THE LIGHT=20
and the WORD(S)?


=A74 TEMPORARY CONCLUSION

I apologize for such a long mail, but I wanted also to show, among=20
other things , that it is possible to handle new and relevant=20
mathematical notions by introducing a SINGLE new word, namely;=20
"homotopy prefibration" , which has a  clear intuitive content, and=20
moreover is easy to translate in most languages.

I have given many arguments to explain my position, and I have many=20
more. But for the moment, I'd like to know the arguments of the persons=20=

in favor of these changes, PRINCIPALLY, of course, those of Paul Taylor=20=

and Peter Johnstone. If it is only the "joke" aspect, I  want to add=20
that I do also like jokes, very much, perhaps not the same as theirs..=20=

I even used to compete with Sammy, who was an expert, about who'd know=20=

some jokes the other didn't.

When this mail was almost completely finished, I found the reaction of=20=

Vaughan Pratt from which I quote:

  "Has the adoption of frivolous nomenclature for quarks ("strange,"
"charm," "beauty" and even "quark" itself) diminished in any way the
world's respect for quarks and their investigators?"

I want to be clear on that matter. I have no objection to "frivolous"=20
naming of NEW concepts by the person or persons who DISCOVERED or=20
INVENTED them. But I object VERY STRONGLY to "renaming" well=20
established concepts, used for more than 40 years by the mathematical=20
community, even if the new names were NOT frivolous, and especially if=20=

such a renaming is made by persons who have made no MAJOR
contribution to the development of the field of FIBERED CATEGORIES.

As a side remark, I have no problem whatsoever to translate in French :=20=

"strange", "charm", "beauty", "quark", "sober" or "bottom". And to be=20
"frivolous", even if it's not so easy in a foreign language,=20
"homotopy's bottom" came ages before Scott's, and "Galois connection"=20
ages before the "french" one.

Since my english is not too good, in particular I knew only "the other"=20=

meaning of "supine",  I'll borrow, a bit freely, from "a good author" I=20=

admire a lot, and remind that:

                Men gave names to many animals
                In the beginning, in the beginning
                Men gave names to many animals
                In the beginning, long time ago.


Best wishes to all, Jean
