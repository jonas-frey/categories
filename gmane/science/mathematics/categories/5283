Suggests a better take on CCAF than the one he has been taking.  That
would be a take based more on Bill's published work on CCAF, and less
on the philosophical objection that Geoff Hellman used to make about
CCAF.  Geoff himself has given up this objection.

This is the Hilbert conception where axioms are not asserted as true
but offered as implicit definition; and so they are not about any
specific subject matter but may be applied to whatever satisfies them.

Lawvere from 1963 on has always been clear that his first order axioms
ETCS and CCAF can be taken this way for metamathematical study -- but
that he does assert them as true specifically of actual sets and
categories.   (Now Bill is not talking about any idealist truth or
objects.  He takes a dialectical view.  But that is another topic.)

This is one use of ETC, and indeed a use made daily in mathematics.
But it is not the use in CCAF.  The fragment of CCAF you are calling
ETC is asserted of specific things.  Bill says it deals with: "the
category whose maps are =91all=92 possible functors, and whose objects are
=91all=92 possible (identity functors of) categories. Of course such
universality needs to be tempered somewhat."  The requisite tempering
is very like that familiar in set theory, and Bill describes it.  (The
quote is his dissertation p. 26 of the TAC reprint.)

What does change it though, is the interpretation of ETC in CCAF. That
interpretation does not use The "Hilbert conception."

Actually, it is best regarded as a single interpretation with a
parameter: interpret "object" in the ETC axioms as "functor from 1 to
X" where X is a fixed free variable of identity functor type in CCAF,
interpret "morphism" as "functor from 2 to X" and so on always with
the same free variable X.  Interpreting the ETC axioms in CCAF this
way is not at all treating them in the Hilbert way.

But even take the interpretation corresponding to any one object A of
CCAF.  That amounts to specifying X as A in the parametrized
interpretation.  This interpretation does not deal with "the
collection of objects of A" and "the collection of morphism of A".  It
never refers to any such collections.  It deals with categories
A,1,2,3, and functors among them.

If you want to push this line:

> Every major historical shift in foundations
> of mathematics so far involved a major change of the notion of axiomatic
> method. (I can substantiate the claim if you'll ask.)

Then you would do better to notice the novelty of these parametrized
and single-category interpretations of ETC in CCAF and take this as
the kind of major change that you expect to see.

This different axiomatic method is explicit in CCAF, and does work
independently there.

Specifically what is supposed to "not work" about it?  Is it supposed
to be formally inadequate to interpreting mathematics?  (That is a
non-starter, and even Feferman only made vague hints that it was so
and never tried to fill them in.)   Is it not really comprehensible?
(Bill comprehended it already around 1960, and so do many of us now.
Feferman argues well that he does not comprehend it, but falsely
concludes that no one can.)

best, Colin
