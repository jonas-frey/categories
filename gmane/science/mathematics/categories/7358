Hi, would it be possible to advertise this post, if you see appropriate?
  It is a logic-based postdoc but, with applications in mind Many thanks.

Postdoctoral Research Assistant - Logic for Autonomous Systems
Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford

Salary in range =A329,249-=A335,938 per annum (grade 7)

The Department of Computer Science of University of Oxford seeks a
postdoctoral researcher to work on a 3-year EPSRC project entitled
`New Foundational Structures for Engineering Multi-UAV Protocols'.

This interdisciplinary project aims to verify autonomous Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV's) that not only navigate, but also communicate
with each other. The project aims to span the full verification
lifecycle: from high-level logical specifications, to oracle-based
test-set reasoning through a bounded model checker, to low-level code
on our four Pelican UAVs.

The position requires a researcher with a proven track record of
high-quality research in logic and its applications - of particular
relevance are formalisms such as:

- Modal and Epistemic Logics
- Dynamic Program Logics
- Probabilistic and Fuzzy logics

Preference will be given to researchers with experience in modelling
and reasoning about epistemic properties of protocols of communicative
Multi-Agent Systems.

The researcher will work closely with Dr Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh and
Professor Michael Wooldridge, and will also be expected to interact
with Professor Daniel Kroening and his team working on the UAV and
verification aspects of the project in order to derive requirements
and case studies.

Informal enquiries are welcome, and should be directed to
Dr Sadrzadeh (mailto:Mehrnoosh.Sadrzadeh@cs.ox.ac.uk).

This post is a full-time appointment, and is available for up to 3
years.

Closing date for applications: **12 noon on Monday 30 July 2012**
