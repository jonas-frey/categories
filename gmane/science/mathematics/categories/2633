Perhaps it is worth mentioning that in the ring of smooth reals R the
sequence a_k = 2^(-k) is Cauchy but has many "limits" because every
infinitesimal dx satisfies the condition "dx is the limit of a_k".
This shows that R is not Cauchy complete, not because limits of Cauchy
sequences are missing but because there are too many.

I once thought the above observation implied there can be no isometric
embedding of a Cauchy-complete field (e.g. the Dedekind reals) into R,
but now I am not convinced anymore.
