I have not thought deeply on this, but it strikes me that the basic
problem is that such a group might not have a uniform topology.  Such a
group will have, I think, a separately continuous multiplication and
hence, if U is a neighborhood of the identity {xU|x \in G} will be a
cover, but there would seem no obvious reason for it to have a
*-refinement.  A continuous homomorphism would be uniformly continuous for
those covers, if they do form a uniformity, it seems to me.

If only John Isbell were still around to answer this kind of question, a
wish I have wished many times since and well before his demise.  But have
you looked in his uniform spaces book?  That is the sort of thing he might
well have considered.  If I were around the math library, I would look.
