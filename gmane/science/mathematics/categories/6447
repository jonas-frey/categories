1 -  In the spirit of the word "array", which I proposed, I suggest
the following names for two special cases.
(i) When I = 1 , instead of "cone",  "column"
(ii) When J = 1 , instead of "sink",  "row"

This would have the following advantages:
(a) In the case of "matrices", i.e. when the product is defined, it
would fit with the usual matrix terminology.
(b) We wouldn't have to change our use of "cone" and "co-cone" over a
diagram D, rows and columns would be the special cases, when D is
discrete.
I have often used "rows" and "columns" in the context of general
"matrices", which I explained in my previous mail, without having met
any ambiguity or incompatibility

2- This "ad hoc" identification, apart from the fact that it "doesn't
immediately suggest a conciser name", needs complicated notions such
as distributors and collages. Moreover it  "doesn't immediately
suggest" generalizations. There is a very simple interpretation in
terms of the canonical fibration  Fam(C) --> Set which can be easily
generalized, and permits to define "arrays" for arbitrary fibrations
p: X --> S, provided S has finite products. With mild assumptions on
p and X, one can even define "matrices" and develop a "matrix calculus"

Best to all,
