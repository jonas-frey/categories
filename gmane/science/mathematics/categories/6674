At Leicester we're going places.  Ranked in the top 12 universities in
Britain our aim is to climb further.  A  commitment to high quality
fused with an inclusive  academic culture is our hallmark and led the
Times Higher Education to describe us as "elite without being elitist".

The  Department has a strong research program in the foundations of
computational models, processes and structures, and the way they support
the engineering of software-intensive systems, including
socio- -technical systems.   The  successful candidate will have a
strong or promising research record in computer  science that is
  aligned with or complements the department's research themes, and will
be able to contribute to undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and
supervision in software  engineering.  Ability to attract funding or
engage with industry are other aspects that we will rate very highly.=20
