Dear Peter,

I stand corrected. My proposition is indeed an immediate consequence =20
of Street and Walters. It is also a consequence of much more general =20
results of mine on foliated categories which I didn't  mention, and I =20=

didn't realize that this special case was easy. This is no excuse. I =20
was careless, and have to "pay" for this carelessness. this is why I =20
make my answer public although your mail was addressed only to me.
There are many mathematical questions I asked you, which you didn't =20
answer. I hope this mail will incite you to answer some of them.

Best regards,
Jean
