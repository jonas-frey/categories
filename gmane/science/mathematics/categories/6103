All I am saying is that one need not read Galois in order to learn
Galois theory.  When a new idea is introduced, even if it is not
explained so clearly that everyone understands it right away, as long as
someone understands it and can rephrase it in a helpful way, the impact
of the idea has been not only felt but disseminated.  Dissemination is
not always a single step.
