The result was in the air - and I'm sure that Joyal in particular saw
it clearly.

For me it (or at least the logical version of it given in Fourman-
Scott) came as an answer to Dana's request for a description of an
internal cHa in a category of "Omega sets". I don't think I had
already heard it from Joyal - but I'm sure he already knew it. It was
easy to see that an object of Loc/Omega represented an internal cHa,
by generalisation of the representation of examples such as the
internal cHa O(R) in Sh(X) as O(RxX) -> O(X), or relaxation of the
representation of sheaves by local homeomorphisms.

Our paper was deliberately (and perhaps mistakenly) concrete rather
than abstract, so we didn't think to phrase the representation
explicitly as an equivalence of categories.

A related (but even more logical and obstinately pointed) result is
given in
Michael P. Fourman. T1 spaces over topological sites. J. Pure and
Applied Algebra, 27(3):223-224, March 1983.
