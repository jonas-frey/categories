		 [New: CSF is now an IEEE symposium.]

			   Call For Papers

       20th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF)
		   Venice, Italy, July 6 - 8, 2007
                            
     Sponsored by the Technical Committee on Security and Privacy
		     of the IEEE Computer Society

CSF20 website:     http://www.dsi.unive.it/CSF20/
CSF home page:     http://www.ieee-security.org/CSFWweb/
CSF CFP:           http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~andrei/CSF07/cfp.html

The IEEE Computer Security Foundations (CSF) series brings
together researchers in computer science to examine foundational
issues in computer security. Over the past two decades, many seminal
papers and techniques have been presented first at CSF. The CiteSeer
Impact page (http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/impact.html ) lists CSF as
38th out of more than 1200 computer science venues in impact (top
3.11%) based on citation frequency. 

Notice: This event was previously known as IEEE Computer Security
Foundations Workshop (CSFW). We are proud to announce that it has been
upgraded to IEEE Symposium starting from this 20th edition.

New theoretical results in computer security are welcome. Also welcome
are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open questions
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories. Panel
proposals are welcome as well as papers. Possible topics include, but
are not limited to:


  Authentication    Access control    Distributed systems
  Information flow  Trust and trust   security
  Security          management        Security for mobile
  protocols         Security models   computing
  Anonymity and     Intrusion         Executable content
  Privacy           detection         Decidability and
  Electronic voting Data and system   complexity
  Network security  integrity         Formal methods for
  Resource usage    Database security security
  control                             Language-based
                                      security

Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press will be
available at the symposium, and selected papers will be invited for
submission to the Journal of Computer Security.

Symposium Location

The 20th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium will be held in
the facilities of Venice International University, located on the
island of San Servolo, about 10 minutes by water ferry from the Piazza
San Marco.

Instructions for Participants

Although submission is open to anyone, attendance is by invitation.
All authors of accepted papers are invited to attend, and authors are
required to ensure that at least one will be present. This year's
meeting location will allow us to invite more participants than
previous years.

Submission Instructions

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have
been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with published proceedings. Papers should be submitted in
Postscript or Portable Document Format (PDF). Papers submitted in a
proprietary word processor format such as Microsoft Word cannot be
considered. At least one coauthor of each accepted paper is required
to attend CSF to present the paper.

Papers may be submitted using the two-column IEEE Proceedings style
available for various document preparation systems at IEEE-CS
Press. Papers in this style should be at most 12 pages long, not
counting bibliography and well-marked appendices. Alternatively,
papers can be in Springer LLNCS style. In LLNCS style papers must be
at most 20 pages long excluding the bibliography and well-marked
appendices.

Committee members are not required to read appendices, and so the
paper must be intelligible without them. Papers not adhering to the
page limits will be rejected without consideration of their merits.

The paper submission website will be open in January 2007.

Proposals for panels are also welcome. They should be no more than
five pages in length and should include possible panelists and an
indication of which of those panelists have confirmed a desire to
participate. They should be submitted by email to the program chair by
March 15, 2007.

A session of five-minute talks was successful in the last two years,
so we are likely to have one again in 2007. Abstracts will be
solicited in May.
