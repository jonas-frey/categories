I apologize for poor taste, but I do like chaotic: one might substitute
indiscrete
in the title ``Chaotic categories and equivariant classifying spaces''
(posted at
http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1201.5178), but surely not essentially
subterminal.
The comment I'd really like to make is that such categories can be
seriously
interesting.
