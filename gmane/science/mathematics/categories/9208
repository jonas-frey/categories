Hi Pawel, we definitly have had plenty of experiences at the quantum =
computing end making it clear that diagrams reduce the respect when =
preducing actual results, and that translating to the Hilbert space =
model, which causes loosing generality, actually increases likeliness of =
acceptance.  I also felt that in Theoretical Computer Science symbolic =
categories also improve the acceptance likeliness as compared to =
diagrams, although this may have been changing recently in part thanks =
to your efforts.  That said, a lot of people do appreciate the idea of =
an entirely diagrammatic formalisms, in particular researchers with a =
multi-disciplinary tendency, and in quantum foundations a diagrammatic =
default for crafting theories is in the process of becoming the =
standard, so there they have been very succesful, artly thanks to =
leading researchers (without a category theory background) such as =
Lucien Hardy picking them up.
