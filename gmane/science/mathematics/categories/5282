The axiomatization of groups (excluding non-empty group) that is known
to me from Borceux's handbook has a constant "e" for the unit and
"double division" x // y governed by the axiom:

x // (((x // y) // z) // (y // e))) // (e // e) =3D z

where the usual group-theoretic structure is related to // by

x // y =3D x^(-1) y^(-1)
x^(-1) =3D x // e
x y =3D (x // e) // (y // e)

I usually use this example when I teach Lawvere's algebraic theories
to explain that we might want a formulation of an (algebraic) theory
that is "canonical" with respect to a choice of operations and axioms.

The relevant reference is:

W. McCune: Single axioms for groups and Abelian groups with various
operations, Journal of Automated Reasoning, 1993, vol. 10, no. 1, p.
1--13.

A non-evil link to this paper:
ftp://info.mcs.anl.gov/pub/tech_reports/reports/P270.ps.Z
(Never ever click on the first hit on Google when it points to
Springer. This just increases their page rank but takes you to a
stupid general page, not the paper itself. And even if it does,
they'll try to sell it to you for some obscene amount of money.)

Tarski's result is cited. The paper contains many other
axiomatizations. The author used the Otter theorem prover extensively
to find the axiomatizations.

With kind regards,

Andrej
