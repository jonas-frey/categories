What:=0A=
Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop that brings =
together researchers in theoretical computer science and category theory.=
=A0 This years, while continuing to welcome talks from all areas of theoret=
ical computer science and category theory, the workshop is happy to host a =
series of tutorials and talks on abstract differential geometry, differenti=
al categories, automatic differentiation, and homotopy theory.  As usual th=
e meeting will be run on a mountain schedule.=A0 =A0=0A=
=0A=
Welcome:=0A=
It you wish to attend,  please confirm your attendance by email with the lo=
cal organizers (Kristine Bauer and Robin Cockett) as soon as possible.  Acc=
ommodation at the field station is limited (more details on the website) an=
d the places will be filled on a first come first served basis.=
