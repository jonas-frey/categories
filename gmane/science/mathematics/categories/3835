AIMS & SCOPE

Building on the success of the nine previous editions (1998-2007), a special
track on coordination models, languages and applications will be held at SAC
2008. Over the last decade, we have witnessed the emergence of models,
formalisms and mechanisms to describe concurrent and distributed
computations and systems based on the concept of coordination.  The purpose
of a coordination model is to enable the integration of a number of,
possibly heterogeneous, components (processes, objects, agents) in such a
way that the resulting ensemble can execute as a whole, forming a software
system with desired characteristics and functionalities which possibly takes
advantage of parallel and distributed systems. The coordination paradigm is
closely related to other contemporary software engineering approaches such
as multi-agent systems, service-oriented architectures, component-based
systems and related middleware platforms. Furthermore, the concept of
coordination exists in many other Computer Science areas such as workflow
systems, cooperative information systems, distributed artificial
intelligence, and internet technologies.

After more than a decade of research, the coordination paradigm is gaining
increased momentum in state-of-the-art engineering paradigms such as
multi-agent systems and service-oriented architectures: in the first case,
coordination abstractions are perceived as essential to design and support
the working activities of agent societies; in the latter case, service
coordination, orchestration, and choreography are going to be essential
aspects of the next generations of systems based on Web services.

The Special Track on Coordination Models, Languages and Applications takes a
deliberately a broad view of what constitutes coordination. Accordingly,
major topics of interest this year will include:

- Novel models, languages, programming and implementation techniques
- Applications of coordination technologies
- Industrial points of view: experiences, applications, open issues
- Internet- and Web-based coordinated systems
- Coordination of multi-agent systems, including mobile agents, intelligent
agents, and agent-based simulations
- Coordination in Service-oriented architectures and Web Services
- Languages for service description and composition
- Models, frameworks and tools for Group Decision Making
- Modern Workflow Management Systems and Case-Handling
- Coordination in Computer Supported Cooperative Work
- Software architectures and software engineering techniques
- Configuration and Architecture Description Languages
- Coordination Middleware and Infrastructures
- Coordination in GRID systems
- Emergent Coordination: Swam based, Stigmergy
- Coordination technologies, systems and infrastructures
- Relationship with other computational models such as object oriented,
declarative (functional, logic, constraint), programming or their extensions
with coordination capabilities
- Formal aspects (semantics, reasoning, verification)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEEDINGS AND POST-PROCEEDINGS

Papers accepted for the Special Track on Coordination Models, Languages and
Applications will be published by ACM both in the SAC 2008 proceedings and
in the Digital Library.

Selected papers will be published in a Journal's special issue.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

PAPER SUBMISSION

Original papers from the above-mentioned or other related areas will be
considered. This includes three categories of submissions: 1) original and
unpublished research; 2) reports of innovative computing applications in the
arts, sciences, engineering, business, government, education and industry;
and 3) reports of successful technology transfer to new problem domains.
Each submitted paper will be fully refereed and undergo a blind review
process by at least three referees. The accepted papers in all categories
will be published in the ACM SAC 2008 proceedings.

Format: Submit your paper electronically in either PDF or postscript format.
Please note: neither hardcopy nor fax submissions will be accepted.
Submissions should be printable on a standard printer on common paper
formats such as letter and DIN A4. Please use a Postscript previewer such as
Ghostview to check the portability of Postscript documents. The author(s)
name(s) and address(es) must not appear in the body of the paper, and self
reference should be in the third person. This is to facilitate blind review.
The body of the paper should not exceed 4,000 words.

Accepted full papers should not exceed 5 pages in a double column format
(with the option, at additional expense, to add three more pages). Accepted
poster papers will be published as extended 2-page abstracts in the
symposium proceedings. All submissions must be received by 7 September 2007

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE

Submission is entirely automated by an eCMS paper management tool, which is
available from the main SAC Web Site:
http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2008/.
Authors must first register their own account by obtaining a password, and
then follow the instructions.
