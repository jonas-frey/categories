Thank you all for your answers.

I didn't know about Conduch=C3=A9 functors, and what I am looking at are =
indeed a
relaxed variant where all unicity conditions are dropped.

The equivalence arising from the Grothendieck construction I am =
interested in is
a variant of the one in (Nielsen 2004, TAC 12(7), pp 248=E2=80=93261), =
but considering
more general natural transformations between relational presheaves (and =
not only
functional natural transformations). The conditions I have given in my =
previous
email are the weak factorization lifting property (WFLP) and the =
discreteness of
fibers in this article.

Dear Thomas,

I use =E2=80=9CGrothendieck construction=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 very =
naively, maybe! =E2=80=93 as a shorthand for
=E2=80=9Cpullback of a functor along the forgetful functor of a category =
of pointed
objects to the category of base objects=E2=80=9D, that is, given a =
category BB of base
objects, and a category BB* of pointed objects, the pullback of a =
functor C ->
BB in the situation

        BB*
        |
        |
        |
        v
C ---> BB

When BB =3D Set, and BB* is the category of pointed sets, pullbacks of =
this form
are discrete fibrations; when BB =3D Cat, pullbacks of this form are =
Grothendieck
fibrations; and I am interested in the case BB =3D Rel, the category of =
sets and
relations. Is that any clearer? If I am using the term too naively, I =
would be
very interested to have a more correct one.

=E2=80=94 Luc=
