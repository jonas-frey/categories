ANNOUNCEMENT OF A COLLOQUIUM

TITLE : Category Theory Yesterday,Today (and Tomorrow?)

A Colloquium in Honour of Jean Benabou

This Two Day Colloquium is the culmination of a week of activities at
ENS
intended to honour Professor Jean Benabou's contributions to
Mathematics over
the last half century.

Born in Rabat in Morocco in 1932, Jean Benabou entered
the EcoleNormale Superieure in 1952, graduating in 1956. He was a CNRS
Researcher from

1956 to 1962, then, after a spell at the University of Chicago from
1966-67 at
the invitation of Saunders Mac Lane, on his return to France he
directed the
research seminar in Category Theory at The Institut Henri Poincare
(and latterly at the Institut Mathematique de Jussieu)
from 1969 to 2001. This Seminar was one of the most influential and
fertile
centres in the development of Category Theory for much of that period,
attracting contributions for over 30 years from  some of the leading
researchers
in the field.

Professor Benabou's own contributions to Category Theory have been
rich, various
and profound, and are ongoing. They will be described in more detail in
the Second Announcement.

The Contributions to this Colloquium will review aspects of his work
and touch
on a selection of his interests. The Colloquium Talks will take place
on the
afternoon of Friday June 3rd and throughout the day on Saturday June
4th. They
will be preceded on the morning of Friday June 3rd by the final and
open session
of a series of Rencontres - Discussions between Professor Benabou and
an invited
panel of several of his mathematical colleagues, which will take
the form of a Round Table. Further details of the subjects for these
discussions
will also be circulated with the Second Announcement
