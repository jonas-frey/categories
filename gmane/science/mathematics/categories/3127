Dear John,

Thanks for your candid and informative letter. I feel that few people who so
far have responded to me (or to others in the discussion that I started)
really understand what my concerns are.

Your comments were very interesting and of course they will not put my
worries to rest. I am grateful, though,  for your taking this as part of a
larger issue, on which I could expand more, but will not, since all I wanted
was to raise awareness, not to preach (or even less to police).

Best thoughts,
Marta
