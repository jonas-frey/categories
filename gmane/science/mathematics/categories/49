Even if one insists that constructive entails predicative the appropriate=
ness of
Cauchy reals is questionable: Lubarsky and Rathjen prove in fact that in =
a=20
subsystem of CZF (Aczel' constructive set theory), i.e., in CZF with
Subset Collection replaced by exponentiation, the Dedekind reals  form a =
proper
class.
In ordinary CZF (that has no choice principle and no powersets),
the Dedekind reals *do* form a set (Aczel & Rathjen), as do more generall=
y the
points of any weakly set-presented T^*_1 locale (Aczel & Curi),
in particular of any locally compact regular one.

It is also useful to recall that (in "On the Cauchy Completeness of the
Constructive Cauchy Reals", MLQ, 53, No. 4-5 (2007), pp. 396-414)
Lubarsky has  proved that the Cauchy Reals are not complete in intuitioni=
stic
set theory without choice.

There's then the point of view that, constructively, the reals should be
considered as a `space', rather than a set, and that in this perspective =
they
are more properly regarded e.g. as a locale/formal space (rather than as =
a
set/class of points with a topology)...
