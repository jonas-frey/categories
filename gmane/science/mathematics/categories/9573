Dear Jean-Pierre,

Yes, someone has. You can look here
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02885
for a discussion about an extension of category theory along the lines of yo=
ur suggestion Y !=3D U. There these are called casting categories. (Caveat -=
  this paper is being ...rather drastically revised prior to publication, and=
  should be updated soon.)
Home sets are disjoint there, but there is an ordering on the objects (which=
  could be arrows...it=E2=80=99s a little like higher category theory, which I=
  know little about.) The upshot is that there is a =E2=80=9CPythonic=E2=80=9D=
  downcast when there is a mismatch between two maps. The intuition is that a=
  clever coercion algorithm is running behind the scenes.=20

If you have suggestions/ideas/questions about applications/uses of such thin=
gs, you should contact the author (me).=20

Best Wishes,
Lucius
