Funny you should ask this just as I was trying to find a satisfying
answer to this question.  Now we are so accustomed that an Euclidean
space has some orthonormal system plonked down somewhere in it,
or that it has at least a fixed origin and the scalar product that
defines lengths and angles.  But, like Eve and Adam were created
without navels, Euclid's space was created without an origin; also
it was created completely flat (with curvature 0 in modern lingo),
so that there is no 'canonical' unit of length; and it was created
withot a priory orientation.  But you can measure one line segment
with another in it, you can also mesure angles, and you can _choose_
one of the two possible orientations and call it positive.
To capture all this I cooked up some structure; you decide if it
does the job.

First, an Euclid's space (let's call it that, to avoid confusing it
with an Euclidean space) is a real affine space (V,P), where
V is a real vector space of _vectors_ in the space, and P is the set
of its _points_.  There are also two operations +: P >< V -> P and
-: P >< P -> V; the first is an action of the additive group of V on P,
so it satisfies a + 0 = a and (a + u) + v  = a + (u + v) for all
points a and all vectors u, v.  Moreover, the two operations are
'local inverses' of each other in the sense that (a + u) - a = u and
a + (b - a) = b for all points a, b and all vectors u.  This definition
eliminates the need for an a priory origin.  To make life easier,
assume V is finite dimensional.

Morphism (V,P) -> (U,Q) of affine spaces is a pair of maps
h: V -> U and f: P -> Q, where h is a linear map and
f(a + v) = f(a) + h(v) for all points a in P and all vectors v in V.

Now, the metric of the Euclid's space.  There are positive-definite
(symmetric bilinear) forms on V.  Call two such forms similar if they
differ by a constant positive factor; a similarity class is therefore
a ray (open half-line with the endpoint the zero form) in the space
of all symmetric bilinear forms on V.  Now consider the structure
E = (V, P, m), where (V,P) is a real affine space and m is a similarity
class of positive-definite forms on V: this is my proposed structure
of Euclid's space.

Let S be the group of all automorphisms (h,f) of the affine space
(V,P) that preserve m:  for every g in m, g(h(u),h(v)) = c g(u,v)
for some positive constant c (depending on h, not depending on u and v)
and all vectors u, v.  These are the similarity trasformations of E,
defining the similarity geometry of E.  If A is any structure built
from vectors and points (and lines etc) in E, then the orbit of A
under S is the object studied in this geometry.

Let R be the group of all automorphisms (h,f) of the affine space
(V,P) that preserve some form in m, and therefore preserve
_every_ form in m: g(h(u),h(v)) = g(u,v) for all g in m and all
vectors u, v.  This is the group of rigid motions of E.

Orientation: if dim V = n, then there is a one-dimensional
space of alternating n-linear forms on V; choosing one of the
two rays (half-lines with the endpoint at the zero form) in this
space chooses the orientation.
