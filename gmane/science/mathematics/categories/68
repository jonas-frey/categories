I would distinguish two slightly different purposes:
1. Being usable in principle to compute values
2. Being usable in practice to compute values needed for modeling, etc.
And I'd say that constructive mathematics is inherently about (1),
although often (and like even classical mathematics, usually best when)
with an eye towards (2).  But (2) itself is something different
(applied mathematics, to give it a name; numerical analysis straddles these.)

Although I've redefined them, I think that this remains true:

Interval arithmetic, despite being more complicated than arithemetic
with either floating-point reals or Dedekind/Cauchy/whatever reals,
is an interesting subject that promises to satisfy both (1)&(2).
This is good for both: good for (1) on the general grounds
that applied mathematics usually leads to good pure mathematics
(especially, but not only, when that mathematics is constructive);
and good for (2) since you'll have theorems that you can be sure of.

Right, and interval arithmetic promises to get us such approximations.
There's still the question of whether demonstrably correct ones
are actually calculable in practice; that depends on the application.
At some point, you have to go beyond even interval arithmetic
and start dealing with probability distributions as your values,
which is yet more complicated theoretically but matches yet more closely
what one actually has in applications.

I'm not sure how much this has to do with category theory anymore,
but as interval arithmetic is already stretching my expertise,
I don't think that I have much more to say anyway.
