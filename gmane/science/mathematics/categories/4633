  2 Phd Studentships in Program Semantics and Verification

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

available at the University of Sussex (Brighton, UK)

to work on an EPSRC funded project the objectives of which is to
develop program logics for function pointers and reflective
programming principles.

Candidates need tp have a good BSc/MSc in Computer Science or
Mathematics and should have some interest in programming languages and
formal methods.  Background in Logic, Semantics, Category Theory, or
Type Theory may be useful but is not essential.  On the more practical
side, experience with theorem provers would be an asset.

Students can take on theoretical problems as well as participate in
concrete tool development or extension.

The studentship (funded by the EPSRC, grant EP/G003173/1) will cover
all tuition fees (for EU citizens) and a yearly maintenance grant at
the standard rate (currently GBP 12,940). Students will be working
under the supervision of Dr Bernhard Reus (PI) and in collaboration
with a Post-Doc embedded in the Foundations of Computation Group of
the Department.

The University is situated in Brighton which is a famous seaside
resort at the English south coast, about 50 miles from London (and
half an hour from Gatwick Airport). It is renowned for its nightlife,
fabulous shops, and cosmopolitan vibe.
