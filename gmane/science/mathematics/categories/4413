Dear Colleagues,


The Department of Computer Science in the University of Leicester, UK,
is offering two new Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) positions. The
deadline for applications is June 16th. The application forms and
further details are here:

 http://www.le.ac.uk/personnel/supportjobs/s3759a.html

A GTA is a funded PhD student who is expected to undertake teaching
duties during the ten week teaching periods of each of our two annual
semesters (roughly, subsets of October to December and January to
March).

These positions should be of special interest to readers of the
Categories and Types mailing lists, with both of these research areas
being very active within the Department.



Roy Crole.
