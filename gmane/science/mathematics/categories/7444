Dear All,

I am delighted to invite you all to the British Mathematics
Colloquium 2013, which will be held on March 25-28th at the
University of Sheffield, organised by David Jordan and
Eugenia Cheng (that's me...)

The conference will start on Monday late afternoon and end
on Thursday at lunchtime and I hope it will be of particular
interest to Category Theorists for the following features among
others:

- Several plenary lectures, including one by Mikhail Kapranov.

- Morning talks in two parallel sessions, including one by
Tom Leinster.

- Six parallel workshops, each with talks filling Tuesday
and Wednesday afternoon.  Needless to say, one of the workshops
will be in Category Theory.  The others are in Algebra, Algebraic
Topology, Analysis, Number Theory and Probability.

- A public lecture given by John Baez on "Maths and the
Environment".

- A discussion session on open access publishing and the future
of journals, with representatives from the London Mathematical
Society (TBC).

Further details will follow with a proper announcement and
registration details.  In the meantime please feel free to
email me if you have any questions.

I hope to see many Category Theorists there!

Regards,
Eugenia Cheng
