Dear All,

As I understand, my previous message was written after Marco's and Steve's
messages, although I saw them only afterwards. Unfortunately I don't have
time now, but putting these things together would be very interesting.
Specifically:

1. Marco vs Steve: Marco's result contains what Michael is mentioning
(=Exercise VIII.4.6 in Mac Lane's book) plus Snake Lemma, but does it
contain what Steve describes as Enrico's result?

2. Marco vs George: And do you, Marco, have a canonical connecting morphism?

3. Steve vs George: Do you, Steve - hence Enrico - have a canonical
connecting morphism depending on what you call z : A ---> C' in your (Steve)
message?

George
