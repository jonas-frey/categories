Hi Eduardo & all

If F is a Grothendieck topos then there is a bounded geometric morphism p:F-=
>Set. Let B be a bound for p, then there is a locale of surjections [N->>B],=
  where N is the natural numbers. This is a locale over F that can be mapped t=
o a locale over Set (apply the direct image of p to the frame of opens of [N=
->>B]). You get the object locale of the localic groupoid that =E2=80=98repr=
esents=E2=80=99 F via Joyal and Tierney. The morphism locale is the image of=
  [N->>B]x[N->>B].=20

Not sure if that sheds much light on what the localic groupoid really is, bu=
t it is one way of constructing it.=20

I=E2=80=99d like to add that any geometric morphism p:F->E, we know, gives r=
ise to a =E2=80=98localic=E2=80=99  adjunction between locales over F and lo=
cales over E; the right adjoint being effectively pullback in the category o=
f toposes. If you can find a locale W over F such that W->1 is an effective d=
escent morphism and the slice of this localic adjunction at W is an equivale=
nce then in fact the adjunction is a connected components adjunction of a lo=
calic groupoid in E; this can be shown by application of Janelidze=E2=80=99s=
  categorical Galois Theorem (the result holds at the generality of cartesian=
  categories - it=E2=80=99s quite straightforward). If you know that the loca=
lic adjunction is a connected components adjunction it is easy to get the Jo=
yal and Tierney result by restricting to local homeomorphisms.

But of course you should complain that it must be hard to show that any loca=
lic adjunction, sliced at W, is an equivalence. In fact even at the general l=
evel of cartesian categories it is not that hard once we recall that the loc=
alic adjunction is stably Frobenius (something that is in the original Joyal=
  and Tierney paper but not dwelt on). For a Frobenius adjunction to be an eq=
uivalence it only needs to have its left adjoint preserve 1 and its unit to b=
e a regular monomorphism. At the slice, 1 is automatically preserved, so we a=
re just left checking that the (sliced) unit is a regular monomorphism. It t=
urns out that this is so for W=3D[N->>B] precisely when B is a bound, effect=
ively completing a proof of the Joyal and Tierney representation theorem.

I hope it is OK that I=E2=80=99ve used this thread to effectively advertise s=
ome work(*) that I did a few years ago.

Kind regards, Christopher
