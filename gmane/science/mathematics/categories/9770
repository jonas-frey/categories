              OPEN CALL FOR PAPERS FOR JOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUE

           Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science

                           Special Issue of the
      Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming (JLAMP)

        http://www.ramics-conference.org/ramics-2018-jlamp-cfp.pdf


IMPORTANT DATES:

   Submission Deadline:        31 March 2019
   Notification of Acceptance: late 2019/early 2020


TOPICS:

Relational and algebraic methods belong to the core of computer science.
This special issue aims to showcase the variety and relevance of recent
developments in this field ranging from theory to applications.

We invite submissions of high-quality original research articles in the
general fields of algebras relevant to computer science and applications
of such algebras. Topics include but are not limited to:

* Theory
   - algebras such as semigroups, residuated lattices, semirings,
     Kleene algebras, relation algebras and quantales
   - their connections with program logics and other logics
   - their formalisation with theorem provers
   - their use in the theories of automata, concurrency, formal languages,
     games, networks and programming languages
   - the development of algebraic, algorithmic, category-theoretic,
     coalgebraic and proof-theoretic methods for these theories

* Applications
   - tools and techniques for program correctness, specification and
     verification
   - quantitative and qualitative models and semantics of computing
     systems and processes
   - algorithm design, automated reasoning, network protocol analysis,
     social choice, optimisation and control
   - industrial applications

While we welcome substantially extended versions of papers published
in the proceedings of the RAMiCS 2018 conference (Springer LNCS 11194,
https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030021481), this call is open to
anyone interested in the field of relational and algebraic methods.


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:

All submissions will be evaluated solely with respect to their novelty,
significance and technical quality according to the high standards of
JLAMP. They must be in PDF format, adhere to the standard JLAMP guide
for authors

   https://www.elsevier.com/journals/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming/2352-2208/guide-for-authors

and be uploaded on Elsevier's online EVISE system

   https://www.evise.com/profile/#/JLAMP/login

selecting the issue type

   VSI: RAMiCS 2018

Deviation from these requirements may lead to immediate rejection.
