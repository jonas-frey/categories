-- SCOPE --

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with
interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging
uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science.

It is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces
and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic
Methods in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic
Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in
Swansea (Wales, 2005), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Udine (Italy, 2009),
Winchester (UK, 2011) and Warsaw (Poland, 2013). The sixth edition will
be held in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, colocated with MFPS XXXI.

-- INVITED SPEAKERS --

Andy Pitts - University of Cambridge, UK (joint with MFPS)
Chris Heunen - University of Oxford, UK
Matteo Mio - CNRS, ENS Lyon, FR
Daniela Petrisan - Radboud University, Nijmegen, NL

-- TOPICS OF INTEREST --

We invite submissions of technical papers that report results of
theoretical work on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the
way these results can support methods and techniques for software

  * Corecursion in Programming Languages
     - Corecursion in logic / constraint / functional / answer set
       programming
     - Corecursive type inference
     - Coinductive methods for proving program properties
     - Implementing corecursion
     - Applications

  * Algebra and Coalgebra in quantum computing
     - Categorical semantics for quantum computing
     - Quantum calculi and programming languages
     - Foundational structures for quantum computing
     - Applications of quantum algebra

-- NEW TOPIC --

This edition of CALCO will feature a new topic, and submission of papers
in this area is particularly encouraged.

* String Diagrams and Network Theory
     - Combinatorial approaches
     - Theory of PROPs and operads
     - Rewriting problems and higher-dimensional approaches
     - Automated reasoning with string diagrams
     - Applications of string diagrams
     - Connections with Control Theory, Engineering and Concurrency


-- SUBMISSION GUIDELINES --

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Experience papers are
welcome, but they must clearly present general lessons learned that
would be of interest and benefit to a broad audience of both
researchers and practitioners. Starting with CALCO 2015, proceedings
will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs???Leibniz International Proceedings
in Informatics series. Final papers should be no more than 15 pages long
in the format specified by LIPIcs
(http://www.dagstuhl.de/publikationen/lipics/anleitung-fuer-autoren/).
It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and
length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected
immediately. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included
in a clearly marked appendix. Both an abstract and the full paper must
be submitted by their respective submission deadlines.

A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer
Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), containing extended versions of
selected papers, is also being planned.

Submissions will be handled via EasyChair
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2015

-- BEST PAPER AND BEST PRESENTATION AWARDS --

Following from the successful trial at CALCO 2013, this edition of
CALCO will feature two awards: a best paper award whose recipients will
be selected by the PC before the conference and a best presentation
award, elected by the participants.

-- IMPORTANT DATES --

Abstract submission:    March 22, 2015
Paper submission:       April 2, 2015
Author notification:    May 6, 2015
Final version due:      June 3, 2015

-- LOCATION --

Nijmegen is the oldest city in the Netherlands and celebrated its
2,000th year of existence in 2005. It is situated in the eastern
province of Gelderland, quite near to the German border. The latin
name for Nijmegen, ???Noviomagus???, is a reminder of its Roman past.
???Noviomagus??? means ???new market??? and refers to the right to hold a
market as granted by the Romans. In the days of Charlemagne, the
city was called ???Numaga???; later on, this became ???Nieumeghen??? and
???Nimmegen???. However, citizens born and bred in Nijmegen speak
affectionately of ???Nimwegen???.

Nijmegen is one of the warmest cities of the Netherlands, especially
during summer, when the highest temperatures in the country are
usually measured in the triangle Roermond ??? Nijmegen ??? Eindhoven.
The lack of north-south oriented mountain ranges in Europe make this
area prone to sudden shifts in weather, giving the region a
semi-continental climate.

-- SATELLITE WORKSHOPS --

The workshop is intended to enable presentation of work in progress and
original research proposals. PhD students and young researchers are
particularly encouraged to contribute. CALCO 2015 will run together
with the CALCO Early Ideas Workshop, with dedicated Early Ideas sessions
at the end of each conference day.

-- CALCO Early Ideas Overview --

The CALCO Early Ideas Workshop invites submissions on the same topics
as the CALCO conference: reporting results of theoretical work on the
mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the way these results can
support methods and techniques for software development, as well as
experience with the transfer of the resulting technologies into
industrial practice. The list of topics of particular interest is
shown on the main CALCO 2015 page.

CALCO Early Ideas presentations will be selected according to originality,
significance, and general interest, on the basis of submitted 2-page short
contributions.  It can be work in progress, a summary of work submitted to a
conference or workshop elsewhere, or work that in some other way might be
interesting to the CALCO audience. A booklet with the accepted short
contributions will be made available.

We encourage PhD students and young researchers to submit Early Ideas papers
to the CALCO 2015 Easychair site as for ordinary submissions, mentioning in
the abstract that the paper is to be considered for an Early Ideas talk..
