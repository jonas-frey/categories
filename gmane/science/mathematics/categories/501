Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic, PSSL 65

  SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

The 65th meeting of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic
will take place in Aarhus (Denmark) over the weekend of
1-2 November 1997.

As usual, we welcome talks on category theory, sheaves, logic, and 
related areas.

To register, please fill out the form below and return (preferably by
email) to Carsten Butz (butz@brics.dk, postal address below) as soon as
possible. 

We maintain a WWW-page with information for the seminar, although this is 
only in addition to the standard procedures (which means: registration,
confirmation, hotel and travel information will be sent out by email
or snail mail, as usually). The URL is

The home page contains links to travel information; we point out that there
are direct flights from London (Heathrow) and Amsterdam to 
Aarhus Airport.
Also, the airport of Billund has many international connections (including
direct flights from Amsterdam, Berlin, Birmingham, Brussels, Paris, 
Frankfurt, London and Manchester).
Both airports are connected to Aarhus City by a good bus service.
>From Central Europe, Aarhus can by reached by train via Hamburg/Flensburg.

We have options for pension/hotel rooms in the range of Kr 300 - Kr 500.
