There is some work by John Cartmell. He applied some 
ideas from his thesis --- about contextual categories, 
generalized algebraic theories and dependent type theory. 
The thesis was Oxford, '78, and some of it appeared in the 
Ann. P. Appl. Logic 32 (1986) 209-243. 

Unfortunately, the only reference to the databases applications 
that I can recall just now is: 

Formalizing the network and hierarchical data models --- an 
application of categorical logic, LNCS 240, 1986. 

Thomas Streicher may perhaps know more ?
