Research Assistant / Postdoc in semantics of programming languages

PLanCompS: Programming Language Components and Specifications

     Department of Computer Science, Swansea University

     Salary scale: GBP 27,047 to 30,424 per annum

     Closing date: 2nd December 2013

     Fixed term, 18 months duration, to start a.s.a.p.

This post will support the EPSRC joint research project
PLanCompS: Programming Language Components and Specifications.
The Swansea team led by Professor Mosses at the Department of
Computer Science, Swansea University is working with teams
from Royal Holloway, University of London and City University
London; Microsoft Research Cambridge is a project partner.
The Department of Computer Science at Swansea University has a
strong and long-established record in the area of fundamentals
of computing.

The project is developing and testing a novel component-based
framework for design, specification and implementation of
programming languages. It includes:

* specification of a collection of highly reusable language
    components called funcons (fundamental constructs);

* translation of major general-purpose programming languages
    (C#, Java, F#) and domain-specific languages to funcons;

* validation of funcon and language specifications by testing=20
    generated prototype implementations;

* design and implementation of an Integrated Development
    Environment (IDE) for component-based specification; and

* creation of a digital library of language specifications.

See www.plancomps.org for a more detailed overview.

The post provides an excellent opportunity for researchers
interested in the formal specification and implementation of
programming languages, and in the tools needed to support
practical language development based on formal semantics.
It would particularly suit candidates with a background in=20
theoretical computer science who are interested in practical
applications.

Candidates for the post are required to have a first degree=20
in Computer Science (or a closely related subject), to have=20
actively engaged in and contributed to writing and publishing
research papers, to be able to understand and specify formal=20
semantics of programming languages, and to be able to program=20
in Java as well as in a functional or logic programming=20
language. Candidates who already have (or will soon complete)=20
a PhD in Computer Science (or a closely related subject) will=20
be preferred.

It is anticipated that interviews will be held in the week of=20
9-13 December 2013.

Informal enquiries may be made to Professor Peter Mosses at
P.D.Mosses@swansea.ac.uk.
