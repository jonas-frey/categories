There is a renewed interest in differential graded, derived, and
triangulated categories.

In this connection, a couple of people have recently found my paper

	Homotopy classification by diagrams of interlocking sequences,
	Math. Colloquium University of Cape Town 13 (1984) 83-120

of some interest.  So I went ahead and scanned it.  Unfortunately the
pdf file is 8MB;  it downloads pretty well for me but may take awhile
from a distance.  I have put it at:

[Our first attempt at scanning created a 250MB pdf file so it is
worth tolerating a few imperfections.]
