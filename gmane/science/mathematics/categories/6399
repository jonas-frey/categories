Dear Colin,

I gave 36 years ago a definition of locally small fibration over an =20
arbitrary base category S. Now look at the following very special =20
case: S =3D Set, C is a category, and  P: Fam(C) --> S the canonical =20
fibration where the fiber over the set I is the category C^I. To say =20
that this P is locally small in my sense coincides exactly with the =20
"more general" notion of C being locally small that you suggest.
Note that my definition of locally small fibration does not suppose =20
that S has a terminal object 1, let alone that 1 is a strong =20
generator in S. To show that this definition is equivalent to the =20
"usual" one, you need not only a replacement scheme in Set, but also =20
the fact that 1 is a strong generator in Set.
Thus I think that the correct general definition of "local smallness" =20=

is the one I gave for fibrations.
As a side important remark, the identity fibration Id(S): S --> S is =20
always locally small without any assumption on S, in particular  S =20
need not have a terminal object, pull-backs or any kind of limit. =20
None of this is true with any of the "variants" of my definition you =20
can find e.g. in the Elephant, where you have to assume that S has =20
finite limits.
Thus "evil" fibrations can be interesting after all.

Best to all,
