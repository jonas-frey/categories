I don't know if it's a new notion, but the following construction of
what I'll call Aff(C), the affinitization (affination?) of C, should
work for any category C concrete over Ab  via a faithful functor
U: C --> Ab.  (Ab(Z,-): Ab --> Set automatically makes Ab concrete over
Set.)  The subcategories of Vct_k we've been talking about, in
particular Euc with origin but liberal morphisms, are all instances of
such a C.  If this is different from torsors I'd appreciate some insight
into the difference.

Definition:

Take the objects of Aff(C) to be those of C.  A morphism in Aff(C) from
c to d is a pair (h, m) where m: c --> d is a morphism of C and
h: U(c) --> U(d) is any group homomorphism such that

     h(x) - h(y)  =  U(m)(x - y)    for all x, y in U(c).

End definition.

The effect of this construction is to make the objects of Aff(c)
generalized metric spaces.  Reading between the lines of the above, an
implicit metric D(x, y) is given by the group structure in the form
x + D(x, y) = y, or equivalently D(x, y) = y - x; there is no need to
make D explicit with its own symbol.

All four Frechet axioms follow after modifying them to make the triangle
inequality an equality and D(x, y) = -D(y, x) (symmetry becomes
antisymmetry).  The morphism (h, m) maps the points of the metric space
via h subject to coherently (over the whole space) maintaining the
distance with m.

That should do it for Euc.  France Dacar did things in the other order:
torsor first, liberate from scale second.  I guess they commute ... but:

To be sure we've been talking about the same category Euc of what France
called Euclid's spaces, for the Euc I have in mind, Euc(E_m,E_n) has
(m+1)n - (m+1 choose 2) + 1 degrees of freedom when 1 <= m <= n.
Outside that range Euc(E_m,E_n) has n degrees of freedom, with rigidity
obliging E_m for m > n to collapse to E_0.  When m = n > 0 this reduces
to 1 + n + (n choose 2), corresponding to the one dilatation, n
translations, and rotation group of order (n choose 2) = n(n-1)/2 in
E_n.  Here's a table.

In contrast Aff_R(A_m,A_n) (affine spaces) has (m+1)n degrees of
freedom, while Vct_R(V_m,V_n) (vector spaces) has mn.

If Euler invented affine geometry as being somehow cleaner than
Euclidean geometry he was going in the right direction, with vector
spaces making things simpler yet via familiar mxn matrices.

Regarding Bob Knighten's question on approaches to synthetic Euclidean
geometry such as Hilbert's axiomatization, has anyone axiomatized more
than E_3 (Euclid Books 11-13)?  A satisfactory definition of Euclidean
space needs to account for all finite dimensions.
