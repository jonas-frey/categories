GENERAL INFORMATION

The 13th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI'01)
will take place at the University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, during two
weeks in August, from August 13 until 24.

The ESSLLI Summer Schools are organised under the auspices of FoLLI
(http://www.folli.uva.nl), the European Association for Logic, Language and
Information.

The main focus of the European Summer Schools is the interface between
linguistics, logic and computation. Foundational, introductory and advanced
courses, workshops and special events cover a wide variety of topics within
six areas of interest:

  * Logic
  * Language
  * Computation
  * Logic and Language
  * Logic and Computation
  * Language and Computation

The number of courses offered is over 50. Previous summer schools have been
highly successful, attracting around 500 students from Europe and elsewhere.
The school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for
discussion for students, researchers and IT professionals interested in
the interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information. In addition
to courses, workshops and evening lectures there will be a Student Session
and a social program.


COURSE PROGRAM

The full scientific program can be found at our home page. Evening
Lectures are given by

 * Edward L. Keenan "Spinoza Lecture" (UCLA)
