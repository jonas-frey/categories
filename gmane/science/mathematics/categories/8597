Master's Program of Computational Logic. This program is offered jointly
at the Free-University of Bozen-Bolzano in Italy, the Technische
Universit??t Dresden in Germany, the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in
Portugal and the Technische Universit??t Wien in Austria. Within this
program you have the choice to study at two /three of the four European
universities. In addition, you can do your project work at the National
ICT of Australia (NICTA). You will graduate with a MSc in Computer
Science and obtain a joint degree. Information on the universities and
