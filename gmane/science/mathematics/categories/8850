ANNOUNCEMENT:
=============================================================================================
PCC 2016
Proof, Computation and Complexity
Fifteenth International Workshop
May 5-6, 2016, Munich, Germany
https://www.irit.fr/PCC2016/

PCC 2016 includes a special session to celebrate Ulrich Berger's 60th birthday.

=============================================================================================


Aim and scope
-----------------------
The aim of PCC is to stimulate research in proof theory, computation,
and complexity, focusing on issues which combine logical and
computational aspects. Topics may include applications of formal
inference systems in computer science, as well as new developments in
proof theory motivated by computer science demands. Specific areas of
interest are (non-exhaustively listed) foundations for specification
and programming languages, logical methods in specification and
program development including program extraction from proofs, type
theory, new developments in structural proof theory, and implicit
computational complexity.


Invited Speakers of PCC
-----------------------
- Dag Normann, Univ. of Oslo, Norway
- Paulo Oliva, Queen Mary Univ. London, UK
- Thomas Streicher, Technical University Darmstadt, Germany


PCC Steering Committee
----------------------
- Reinhard Kahle, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal
- Lars Kristiansen, University of Oslo, Norway


Program Committee
-----------------------
- Reinhard Kahle, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal (co-chair)
- Lars Kristiansen, University of Oslo, Norway
- Ralph Matthes, IRIT, CNRS and Univ. de Toulouse, France (co-chair)
- Isabel Oitavem, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal
- Anton Setzer, Swansea, UK


Contributed talks
-----------------------
We solicit contributions in the fields of PCC, non-exhaustively
described above. Please register a contribution at the EasyChair site
for PCC 2016:https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pcc20160  (please
note the trailing zero).
This consists in a title, a short text-only abstract and
the PDF file of a LaTeX abstract that fits on one page in format A4.
(The latter PDF file is not compulsory on first submission.)

PCC is intended to be a lively forum for presenting and discussing
recent work. Progress on a not yet satisfactorily solved problem may
well be worth presenting - in particular if the discussions during the
workshop might lead towards a solution.

We also manage the abstracts for the special session by this EasyChair
installation. If your abstract is meant for the special session, then
please check the corresponding checkbox in the submission form.


Important dates
-----------------------
- Deadline for proposing a contributed talk: March 31st, 2016 (AoE)
- Notification of acceptance: April 18, 2016
- Registration deadline: April 26, 2016
    (there is essentially no registration fee, see the web page)
