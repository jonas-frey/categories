Dear Marta,

Yes, I am sure Saunders saw his excursions into geometrical mechanics
as a `hobby', and wasn't seeking to make original contributions (other
than, perhaps, a new way of looking at established results). I remember,
when I was in Chicago in 1975--76, he asked me whether I knew L.A. (Alan)
Pars, a Cambridge mathematician whose book on dynamics was one of his
favoured sources. (At the time I didn't know him -- he had retired long
before I first went to Cambridge -- but I did meet him subsequently.
He was then in his nineties, and was delighted to learn that Saunders
was a fan of his work.)

Regarding the spelling of Saunders's surname: my recollection is that,
once he had decided to adopt the space in `Mac Lane', he was quite
insistent that everyone should use it. Since that happened well before
1968, it's surprising that he allowed `MacLane' to stand on the title
page of those 1968 notes.

Best regards,
Peter
