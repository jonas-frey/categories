Thanks for all the responses so far.  It's been pointed out to me that
my post used some terms in a vague way, so let me try to be a little
more precise.  Let B = {0,1} and NAND: B^2 -> B be the usual NAND
function.  Then any function B^n -> B can be expressed as the
composition of a finite number of uses of the diagonal function
D:B->B^2, projections, permutations, and NAND.

Let Omega be the subgraph classifier described below.  I'm working
with the topos of reflexive directed multigraphs, that is, graphs
whose vertices are equipped with a chosen self-edge and that allow
multiple parallel directed edges between any pair of vertices.  I
suspect that any graph homomorphism from Omega^n to Omega (where
finite powers are given by the categorical product) can be expressed
as the composition a finite number of uses of the diagonal graph
homomorphism D:Omega -> Omega^2, projections, permutations, and some
finite number of operations with signature Omega^2 -> Omega.

My best guess at a such a set of operations is
     1. Map all vertices of Omega^2 to t and apply NAND to the edges,
treating "in" as true and all the "outs" as false,
     2. NAND together the vertices.  Edges between any of (t,f), (f,t),
and (f,f) map to in and the others map to the appropriate outs, and
     3. (t,t) maps to t; the rest of the vertices map to f.  (in, in)
maps to in; the rest of the edges map to the appropriate outs.

I would like to know if
     a. a single set of operations suffices for all n
     b. if so, what the smallest size of such a set is and an example
of such a minimal set
     c. if not, how the size of the necessary set grows with n.

Thanks!
