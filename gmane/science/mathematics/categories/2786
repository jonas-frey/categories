Second Announcement-Octoberfest '05
========================================

The "not-quite-annual" Octoberfest has been a great
tradition among category theorists for several decades now.
This weekend conference has always been held at McGill
University, but this year is moving down the highway to the
University of Ottawa. It will be hosted by the Logic and
Foundations of Computing group (LFC). See our website at
www.mathstat.uottawa.ca/lfc. The conference will be held on
the weekend of October 22nd-23rd.   The Octoberfest webpage is:

(Western). He will also be giving a special Distinguished
CRM lecture to the Ottawa-Carleton Mathematics Institute, at
3:30 Friday afternoon, October 21, and early arriving
Octoberfest participants are cordially invited to attend.
