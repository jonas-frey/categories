Eduard Cech centre had been established in 2005 as the national research
centre focusing its attention to interactions between algebra, geometry, and
logic (and their applications in cryptology, computer science, etc.). It
is jointly operated by mathematicians from Masaryk University in Brno,
Charles University in Prague and Academy of Sciences of the Czech
Republic, with offices both in Brno and Prague.

The Centre invites applications for several research positions commencing
during the year 2011 at the date depending on mutual agreement. The positions
are for at most one year. The candidates must be recent PhD's that obtained
their degree not earlier than 2 years before the beginning of their contract
with the Eduard Cech Centre.

Candidates should submit a letter of application accompanied by a CV,
list of publications and an outline of their research project to
Professor Jan Slovak (slovak@muni.cz) not later than July 31, 2010.
They should also arrange for at least 2 letters of recommendation (at most
one can be from a Czech mathematician) to be mailed directly to
slovak@muni.cz before July 31, 2010. The successful applicants will
be notified as soon as possible but not later than August 31, 2010.
