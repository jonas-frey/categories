On the subject of Heyting algebras, usage seems to be ambiguous
as to whether they should have (and their morphisms preserve)
finite joins.   I suggest that we should say "Heyting lattice"
if they should, and "Heyting semilattice" if not.

I too turn to Wikipedia for information on most subjects.  For
example its medical information is far superior to any other
lay source that I have seen.  But I have two reservations:

Authority.  Journalists like to take swipes at it on the grounds
that anyone can edit it,  but in my opinion they over-estimate
the reliability of "authoritative" sources.  A traditional paper
encyclopedia consults only a small number of experts on each topic,
so it's likely to be cliquey.   On the other hand, there are
frequently stories in www.TheRegister.co.uk (online geek news)
about cliques taking over Wikipedia.

Closer to home, the coverage of mathematics is extremely poor in
comparison to other subjects.  Usually, there is just the stark
classical undergraduate definition, with neither advanced
mainstream material nor any constructive critique.   In my work
on ASD, particularly its application to real analysis, I have
wanted to refer to classical sources as a background, but on none
of the relevant topics have I considered the Wikipedia article
to be anywhere near satisfactory.  All spaces are Hausdorff, and
Excluded Middle is a Fact.   I have thought about rewriting the
articles on Dedekind cuts, locally compact spaces and some other
things, but am afraid that my contributions will just be "reverted".

Maybe if other categorists and constructivists joined in too,
I would feel in better company.

No, I don't want knock Wikipedia.  It's a Good Thing, in principle.
And I would like to encourage others to improve the mathematical
coverage.

By the way, there's also PlanetMath.org, in which authors "own"
their articles, unless they have demonstrably abandoned them.

Since I'm here, I would like to point out that there are thoroughly
revised versions of
	The Dedekind Reals in ASD (with Andrej Bauer)
and	A Lambda Calculus for Real Analysis
on my web page at   www.PaulTaylor.EU/ASD/analysis.php

The second of these contains a "need to know" introduction to the
Scott topology, proof theory and the lambda calculus,  ie it is
written with the general mathematical audience in mind.
