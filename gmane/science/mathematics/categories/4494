I'm with Michel on this one:

Not a single abutment in any of the following YouTube videos posted by
their proud aboutisseurs.

Evidently G needed a word with the sense of "limit" or "completion" that
didn't overload terms that already had technical meanings in that
context while itself having a technical ring to it, which
"aboutissement" seems to do nicely in French.  Something like "terminus"
might serve this purpose in English.

An abutment is an engineering construct for butting two things together,
often in the context of bridges, whether over a river or between teeth,
and seems quite unsuitable for this purpose.
