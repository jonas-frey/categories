I have seen several references to an unpublished 1973 manuscript by Jean
Benabou on profunctors.

I have had no success finding an e-mail address for Prof. Benabou. Does he
have one?

Peter Johnstone has a very nice synopsis of the subject in his new book in
section B 2.7.  Francis Borceux has a more elementary treatment of
distributors in the first volume of his handbook of categorical algebra.

Are there other sources which offer a substantial discussion of profunctors?

I would be happy to pay duplication and mailing costs to obtain a copy of the
Benabou paper.

Thanks for any information you can provide.
