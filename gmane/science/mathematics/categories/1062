For myself, the short answer is I don't know.

Perhaps I ought to, since I've made lots of geometric theries out of
classical ones, but in practice the problem goes further than a strict
answer to the question would provide. One often needs not just to transform
the theories within a fixed language but to tranform the language itself. A
simple example is negation as "cared-for particular" to use Bill's phrase.
It is especially true once one starts using the full geometric logic, with
infinitary disjunctions (unlike the coherent logic in Mac Lane and
Moerdijk). One then sees, for instance, that geometric logic is actually
weak second order, with universal quantification bounded over finite sets.
