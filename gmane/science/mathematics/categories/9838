===========================================================
                        First Call for Contributions
                                      LCC 2019
20th International Workshop on Logic and Computational Complexity
                        July 8, 2019, Patras, Greece
                        Collocated with ICALP 2019
                   http://www.cs.swansea.ac.uk/lcc/
===========================================================

LCC meetings are aimed at the foundational interconnections between
logic and computational complexity, as present, for example, in
implicit computational complexity (descriptive and type-theoretic
methods); deductive formalisms as they relate to complexity
(e.g. ramification, weak comprehension, bounded arithmetic, linear
logic and resource logics); complexity aspects of finite model theory
and databases; complexity-mindful program derivation and verification;
computational complexity at higher type; and proof complexity. The
program will consist of invited lectures as well as contributed talks
selected by the Program Committee.

IMPORTANT DATES:

  * submission     May 1, 2019
  * notification   May 20, 2019
  * workshop       July 8, 2019

SUBMISSION:

Submissions must be in English and in the form of an abstract of about
3-4 pages. All submissions should be submitted through Easychair at:

    https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lcc19

We also welcome submissions of abstracts based on work submitted or
published elsewhere, provided that all pertinent information is
disclosed at submission time. There will be no formal reviewing as is
usually understood in peer-reviewed conferences with published
proceedings. The program committee checks relevance and may provide
additional feedback.

Monika Seisenberger, Co-chair, Swansea University, UK
Sam Buss, University of California, San Diego, US
Anupam Das, University of Copenhagen, Denmark
Anuj, Dawar, University of Cambridge, UK
