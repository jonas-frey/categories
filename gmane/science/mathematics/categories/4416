In Genoa, in the late 60's and after, our group was studying
categories of relations.

I was interested in relations on abelian categories, for homological
algebra, while Gabriele Darbo, Franco Parodi and others were more
interested - after the general construction - in relations on sets,
and even more in "corelations on sets" (relations on Set^op), called
"transductors". (It is the dual construction, based on equivalence
classes of cospans of sets, i.e. quotients of the sum of domain and
codomain; used to simulate electric connections between two sets of
terminals [see how they compose], and as a formal basis for a general
"theory of devices".)

At that time, a category with involution  u |--> u*  (typically, a
category of relations in some sense) was called "von Neumann regular"
if the condition  u.u*.u = u  holds for every arrow (plainly related
to von Neumann regularity of semigroups and rings).

The category of relations of sets is not vN-regular, the simplest
counterexample being likely the Z-shaped relation which transgresses
your condition:

R: {x, y} --> {x', y'}
x R y,    x' R y,     x' R y'

This relation was precisely called "Z" in the paper

  [Pa] F. Parodi, Simmetrizzazioni di una categoria II, Sem. Mat.
Univ. Padova, 44 (1970), 223-262.

On the other hand, as you say, category of relations on abelian
categories are von Neumann regular (which is a crucial fact in
studying subquotients, see Mac Lane's text on Homology).

But, interestingly, the category of CORELATIONS on sets is also von
Neumann regular, see the paper above [Pa].
