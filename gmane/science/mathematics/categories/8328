It is with great sadness that I announce that my longtime friend and collab=
orator,
Dietmar Schumacher, died on Wednesday September 17, 2014, of a massive stro=
ke.

It was in 1971, when he took up his position at Acadia University, that he =
left a note
on my office door introducing himself and suggesting we meet to discuss cat=
egory
theory. We did and that was the start of our long collaboration. We also st=
arted, in 1972,=20
the category seminar which still runs today, 42 years later. For many years=
  he would drive
the 100 kms from Wolfville every week to attend the seminar, and drive back=
  afterwards.=20
He would sometimes speak in the seminar or, if not, stimulated discussion w=
ith his penetrating=20
questions. The last few years, he came less often as he found the drive tir=
ing, but invariably=20
he would read up on the topic of the week and always emailed me a question =
or two about it.
He kept up his interest in category theory until the end. He came to the fi=
rst seminar this year,
just two weeks ago, looking strong and fit as ever.

We'll miss his wry sense of humour. His way of apologizing for some little =
thing, and then=20
apologizing for apologizing.

Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.
