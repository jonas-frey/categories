                    Call for Participation

MIDLANDS GRADUATE SCHOOL IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING SCIENCE

                           (MGS 2010)

The MGS is the leading annual research training event in Theoretical
Computer Science in the UK. We are widely known for our courses on the
mathematical foundations of computing. Our main mission is advanced
research training for PhD students, but our school is open for anyone.
We have consistently been evaluated as excellent: All recent
participants would recommend the school to others. The MGS addresses
primarily PhD students in their first and second year. But we warmly
welcome postdoctoral researchers, academics or industrial
practitioners as well. Further information can be found at the MGS
2010 web site.
