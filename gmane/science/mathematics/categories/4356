It's not category theory, but you might anyway be interested in...

THE RANKIN LECTURES 2008

The Rankin Lectures 2008 will be given by John Baez (University of
California, Riverside).  The series title is

"My Favorite Numbers"

and the individual lecture titles are

Mon 15 September, 4pm:  "5"
Wed 17 September, 4pm:  "8"
Fri 19 September, 4pm: "24".

They will be held at the University of Glasgow, and are supported by the
Glasgow Mathematical Journal Trust.  Information and abstracts can be
found at

http://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~tl/rankin/


If you can come, you'd be very welcome to visit for the week and chat -
there should be some like-minded people about.  As it's a lecture series
rather than a conference, there are no travel funds and we're not
organizing accommodation, but you can find practical information on
visiting at www.maths.gla.ac.uk .

Best wishes,
Tom
