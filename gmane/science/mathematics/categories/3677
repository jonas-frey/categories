i like the example of the semigroups. i think in some sense the addition
of d does not add enough information to our monoid so if we have two
semigroup homomorphisms that agree on A then by using the properties of
semigroup homomorphisms we are forced to define how they behave on d in
only one way. i'm still trying to incorporate the inclusion of the 2x2
upper triangular matrices into all 2x2 matrices and Michael Barr's
example into this framework.
