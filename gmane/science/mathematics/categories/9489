Dear Thomas,

What I'm curious to understand is how inevitable is a certain practical beha=
viour of universes. In many situations we know they are foundationally neces=
sary, but we still seek ways to disregard them in everyday mathematics.

If we try to use generalized spaces as our prime notion of collection, inste=
ad of sets, it begins to look different. We still have universes of a kind. =
For example the object classifier is a universe whose elements are sets (dis=
crete spaces). But one would not make the mistake of thinking it is a set it=
self, as it has a non-discrete topology - it even has non-identity specializ=
ation morphisms in functions between sets. There are various other universes=
  for various other kinds of spaces, such as the Boolean algebra classifier f=
or Stone spaces. The different universes represent qualitative distinctions,=
  not just one of "size".

As you know, I'm trying to do something along those lines but based on arith=
metic universes instead of Grothendieck toposes.=20

All the best,

Steve.
