Bourbaki in his Algebra, and MacLane & Birkhoff in their Algebra,
have similar definitions.  I do not know the one you cite.  However,
the definition I have given describes an affine space as an honest
equationally presented algebraic structure; usually they just
assert that given any two points a and b, there exists a unique
vector v such that a + v = b.  With the difference of points an
explicitly given operation of the structure, the axiom
a + (b - a) = b gives the existence, and the axiom (a + v) - a = v
the uniqueness.

Using an n-dimensional real space instead of beloved R^n gets rid
of the `canonical' basis.  Observing vectors as translations of
the space of points does away with an a priory origin.  My contribution
was that to do without an a priory unit of length, let the metric
of the Euclid's space be given by a class of mutually proportinal
positive definite forms, instead of a single form.

Or shall we say that an affine space is a perfect geometric communism
where all points are equal, while in a vector space one vector is
more equal than others.
