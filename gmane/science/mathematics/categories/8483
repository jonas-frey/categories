Dear Colleagues

This is devastating news.=20

Bob started at Sydney University after finishing his PhD in 1970 at=20
the Australian National University. I started at Macquarie the same
year. That is when our friendship and collaboration began. He was
an exciting person to work with and I admired him greatly. We
started thinking about Yoneda structures almost immediately.

Bob was a major influence on category theory in general but
especially on Australian category theory. His charismatic lectures
to undergraduates at Sydney University encouraged many students=20
to continue in mathematics and category theory. He saw early,=20
in his own original terms, how categories applied to computer
science.

One of Bob=92s great achievements was understanding Higg=92s
work on Heyting-valued equality in the light of Bill Lawvere=92s
insight into Cauchy completion via adjointness. This gave a
vital reason for extending enriched category to a base bicategory.

There is so much to Bob=92s work and influence.=20

The latest issue of Applied Categorical Structures landed on my=20
desk just last week; Bob is a joint author of a paper there.=20

I was hoping to see Bob at CT2014 in Cambridge. He had planned
to go and to speak. This wasn=92t to be.

As Bill said, our deepest condolences are with his family.=20

Ross
