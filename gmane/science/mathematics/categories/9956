Though Charles Ehresmann had extensively used the notion of groupoids
(taken from Brandt, 1926) from his 1950 paper on connections?? up, the
first paper where he explicitly used categories is "Gattungen von
lokalen Strukturen (Jahresb. d. Deutschen Math.1957) which is at the
basis of many of his and my later works

  From 1963 on, he published abstracts of his articles on category theory
(e.g. on'structured' or 'internal' categories),in a series of "Notes aux
Comptes-Rendus de l'Acad??mie des Sciences" and they were classified in
the Section "Alg??bre Homologique". At that time, he asked if if was not
possible to create a new more adapted Section called "Th??orie des
Cat??gories", but it was refused. It is only in 1966 that the Acad??mie
created a Section called "Alg??bre des cat??gories" (which contained his
last Notes).
