MATRIX [http://www.matrixatmelbourne.org.au] is a new research institute =
outside of Melbourne, VIC, Australia. The first program will be held =
from June 5 =E2=80=94 18, 2016, and will consist of a workshop and a =
conference. At the workshop there will be six mini-courses, each =
consisting of 2 or 3 talks.

Workshop June 6 =E2=80=94 10. Higher Structures.

Clark Barwick: Parametrised Higher Category Theory and Parametrised =
Higher Algebra
Philip Hackney & Marcy Robertson: infinity properads
Ralph Kaufmann: Feynman categories
Martin Markl: Operad-like structures, pasting schemes and graph =
complexes
Emily Riehl: weak complicial sets
Victor Turchin: Embedding calculus and the little discs operads

Conference June 15 =E2=80=94 17. Higher Structures: Advances.

Registration is now open at the MATRIX webpage =
[http://www.matrixatmelbourne.org.au/events/higher-structures-in-geometry-=
and-physics/] (be sure to add all events that you will attend to your =
=E2=80=98cart=E2=80=99), but space is limited. Funding is only available =
to invitees. MATRIX can help arrange accommodation for other =
participants.

Best regards,
Philip Hackney and Marcy Robertson=
