CALCO 2007 will be preceded by the CALCO Young Researchers Workshop,
CALCO-jnr, dedicated to presentations by PhD students and young
researchers at the beginning of their carriers.

CALCO brings together researchers and practitioners to exchange new
results related to foundational aspects and both traditional and emerging
uses of algebras and coalgebras in computer science. The study of algebra
and coalgebra relates to the data, process and structural aspects of
software systems.

This is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces
and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods
in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development
Techniques). The first, and very successful, CALCO conference took place
2005 in Swansea, Wales.

The second event will take place 2007 in Bergen, Norway.

The CALCO Young Researchers Workshop, CALCO-jnr, is a CALCO satellite
workshop dedicated to presentations by PhD students and by those who have
completed their doctoral studies within the past few years.  Attendance at
the workshop is open to all - it is anticipated that many CALCO conference
participants will want to attend the CALCO-jnr workshop (and vice versa).

CALCO-jnr presentations will be selected according to originality,
significance, and general interest, on the basis of submitted 2-page
abstracts, by the organisers. A booklet with the abstracts of the accepted
presentations will be available at the workshop.

After the workshop, the author(s) of each presentation will be invited
to submit a full 10-15 page paper on the same topic. They will also be
asked to write (anonymous) reviews of papers submitted by other authors
on related topics. Additional reviewing and the final selection of papers
will be carried out by the CALCO-jnr PC.

The volume of selected papers from the workshop will be published as a
Department of informatics, University of Bergen, technical report, and
it will also be made available in an open access database searchable from
http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/o/oaister/. Authors will retain copyright,
and are also encouraged to disseminate the results reported at CALCO-jnr
by subsequent publication elsewhere.


Topics of Interest
------------------
The CALCO Young Researchers Workshop will invite submissions on the same
topics as the CALCO conference: reporting results of theoretical work
on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the way these results
can support methods and techniques for software development, as well as
experience with the transition of resulting technologies into industrial
practise. In particular, the workshop will encourage submissions included
or related to the topics listed below.

  * Abstract models and logics
    - Automata and languages,
    - Categorical semantics,
    - Modal logics,
    - Relational systems,
    - Graph transformation,
    - Term rewriting,
    - Adhesive categories

  * Specialised models and calculi
    - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems,
    - Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed,
      mobile, and context-aware computing,
    - General systems theory and computational models
      (chemical, biological, etc)

  * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
    - Abstract data types,
    - Inductive and coinductive methods,
    - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation),
    - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques,
    - Semantics of programming languages

  * System specification and verification
    - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification,
    - Formal testing and quality assurance,
    - Validation and verification,
    - Generative programming and model-driven development,
    - Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
      hardware/middleware/architectures,
    - Process algebra
