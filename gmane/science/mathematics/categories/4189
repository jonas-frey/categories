[Note from moderator: Jack may refer to a nice picture linked from:

A few neat, if low-res, pictures of Alex (and Saunders) at Coimbra =

may be found as the jpegs

http://home.att.net/~b.mikolajewska/booknook/titles/Symposium/Sym-25.jpg

or on the book pages

http://home.att.net/~b.mikolajewska/booknook/titles/Symposium/S-19.htm

and those before and after. While these may well NOT be the images =

Jack meant, they may do until he provides more specific references.

Of course, I, like all who had the privilege of coming to know Alex
and Grace, mourn the passing of this cosmopolitan gentleman, quiet
scholar, and supportive enthusiast for category theory. Would that I
might know how to support Grace in these terrible hours: my heart goes
out to her, as also to his children, both biological and mathematical.
