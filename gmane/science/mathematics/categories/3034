SPECIAL SESSION ON THE WORKS OF MAC LANE AND EILENBERG
------------------------------------------------------

  A special commemorative session in honor of the two founders of
  category theory, Saunders Mac Lane and Samuel Eilenberg, will be
  held at CT 2006. Contributors who are interested in having their
  talk be part of this special session should indicate so when they
  submit their abstract.  Since the special session will be one-half
  day, only a limited number of talks can be accommodated.

UPCOMING DEADLINES:
-------------------

 February 27: Submission of Abstracts
 ------------

  Prospective speakers should submit an abstract of up to one page.
  Abstracts should be sufficiently detailed to allow the scientific
  committee to assess the merits of the work.  Submissions should be
  in plain text, Postscript, or PDF format, and must be sent to
  ct06@mathstat.dal.ca by FEBRUARY 27.  (Proposals for talks at the
  special session on Mac Lane and Eilenberg will be accepted until
  March 15).  Receipt of all submissions will be acknowledged by
  return email. Authors will be notified by March 30 of the acceptance
  of their talks.

 (The remainder of this announcement contains information repeated
 from previous announcements.)

 The International Category Theory Conference (CT) covers all areas of
 pure and applied category theory. Topics of interest include, but are
 not limited to: higher dimensional categories, categorical logic,
 applications of categories in algebra, topology, combinatorics, and
 other areas of mathematics, applications of category theory to
 computer science, physics and other mathematical sciences. Previous
 meetings in this series were held in Vancouver (2004), Como (2000),
 Coimbra (1999), Vancouver (1997), Halifax (1995), Tours (1994), Isle
 of Thorns (1992), Montreal (1991), and Como (1990).

 CT 2006 will be held at White Point Beach Resort
 (http://www.whitepoint.com/), a seaside resort in Nova Scotia
 (Canada), about 100 minutes' drive from Halifax. It will be an active
 research-oriented conference, in something of an "Oberwolfach style".
 All those interested in category theory and its applications are
 welcome.
