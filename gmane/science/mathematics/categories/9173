[Announcement of PhD-positions below]

There is a one-year position (starting at 1/10/2017) available at the =
\universit=C3=A9 Libre de Bruxelles\ (ULB), to replace a professor that =
leaves our department. The opening is in algebraic geometry, but this =
will be interpretted in a very broad sense.

http://www.ulb.ac.be/facs/sciences/math/emploi.html

Somewhat misleading, our university calls this postion a =E2=80=9Cpostdoc=E2=
=80=9D, but the teaching load is high compared to usual postdocs: up to =
120h (4 courses)  for  applicants with a PhD from before 30/9/2014, or =
up to 90h (3 courses) for applicants with a PhD that was obtained later.
As almost all of our teaching (especially in Bachelor years) is in =
French, the ideal candidate should be able to teach in French from the =
beginning of the mandate.

The vacancy will be re-opened (in a new call) for a permanent possition =
in 2018.=20

If someone is interested, she/he can contact myself =
(jvercruy@ulb.ac.be), the president of the Math department =
presmath@ulb.ac.be (Ignace Loris) or the president of the "teaching =
commitee=E2=80=9D of the Math department dbonheur@ulb.ac.be.
The closing date for applications is 1/5/2017.

=E2=80=94=E2=80=94

Apart from the above, the Math Department of the ULB also announced the =
opening of 4 mandates for teaching assistants, all starting at =
1/10/2017. These are 2 year mandates that are renewable twice (so 6 =
years in total). The renewal of a mandate is usually just a formality.=20=

In the Belgian system, a teaching assistant spends about 50% of his time =
on teaching (and related pedagogical tasks), and 50% on research that =
leads to a PhD (which should be obtained within the 6 years time). Since =
most of the teaching in our department is in French, candidates who can =
show that they are able to teach in French from the start of the mandate =
will clearly have an advantage.=20

The positions are open to all disciplines, but in order to apply, an =
applicant should first get in contact with a professor of the Math =
Department who is willing to act as the supervisor of the PhD.=20
Our department has research groups in Algebra and combinatorics, =
Differential Geometry, Partial Differential equations, Mechanics and =
applied mathematics, Actuarial sciences, Mathematical Statistics and =
Probability.

More information can be found here
http://www.ulb.ac.be/facs/sciences/math/emploi.html
The deadline for applications is 19/6/2017

Best wishes,
Joost Vercruysse.
