Dear Vasili:  The author doesn't refer to, nor even seem to know about, =
my book with J. Lambek,
Introduction to Higher-Order Categorical Logic, J. Lambek and P. J. =
Scott,=20
Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986, where all this was done in  great detail.=20=


In fact, the three way correspondence between categories of deductive =
systems,  of
cartesian closed categories, and of typed lambda calculi (which the =
author wishes
to explain) was first done there, with many applications.


 							Best,
   							Phil Scott
