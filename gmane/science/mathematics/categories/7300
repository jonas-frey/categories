Following that link, a search leads to

http://mathdoc.emath.fr/archives-bourbaki/PDF/nbt_029.pdf

where we find Le Tribu no. 28 (reporting in a meeting of June-July
1952).  Page 3 includes this report on the state of Theorie des
Ensembles Ch. 4, Structures:

>  Le Congr=E8s =E0 travaill=E9 pour d=E9gager la notion de homomorphisme.

The context is interesting.  The point is, this confirms what was
already known, that Bourbaki worked to find a general notion of
homomorphism after Weil (1951) suggested they should.  And Weil had
named Mac~Lane as suggesting the idea.
