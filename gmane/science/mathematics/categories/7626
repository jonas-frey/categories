Hi Claudio,=A0=0A=0AI was thinking yesterday night about the problem you po=
sed,=A0=0A=0A> If C is a symmetrical monoidal category and every object has=
  a natural monoid=A0=0A> structure (that is any map is a monoid=A0 morphism=
) then C is cocartesian monoidal=A0=0A> (tensor =3D sums).=0A=0A=0Ain light=
  of the=A0three very different answers which arrived to it on=A0=0AWednesda=
y. =A0I was sufficiently surprised by my own conclusions that=A0=0AI feel a=
=A0need to share=A0them.=0A=0A=0AThe statement, as given, is a little vague=
; I interpret it as follows.=0A=0APROPOSITION 0: Let (V,@,I) be a symmetric=
  monoidal category, and=0Asuppose that the forgetful functor U : Mon(V,@,I)=
--->V is split epi in=0Athe (1-)category of (mere) categories and functors.=
  =A0Then I is initial=0Aand @ is cocartesian.=0A=0A[A splitting of U maps e=
ach object of V to a specific monoid,=0AA |-> (A,m_A,e_A), and every arrow =
to itself. =A0In other words, every=0Aarrow f:A-->B must be a homomorphism =
with respect to the specific=A0=0Astructures (A,m_A,e_A) and (B,m_B,e_B).=
=0A=0AIt turns out, to my surprise, that Proposition 0 is false: I will=0Am=
omentarily demonstrate this by means of a concrete counter-example;=0Abut f=
irst let me address the issue of what is true.=0A=0AChris Heunen suggests p=
atching the statement of=A0Proposition 0 as follows.=0A=0APROPOSITION 1: Le=
t (V,@,I) be a symmetric monoidal category, and=0Asuppose that the forgetfu=
l functor U : Mon(V,@,I)--->V is invertible=0Ain the (1-)category of (mere)=
  categories and functors. =A0Then I is=0Ainitial and @ is cocartesian.=0A=
=0AProposition 1 is indeed true, but its utility is somewhat suspect.=0ATo =
show that U is invertible one must show not only that every object=0AA carr=
ies a monoid structure, but that every monoid structure on A=0Aequals the g=
iven one.=0A=0AMike Shulman suggests instead (what amounts to):=A0=0A=0APRO=
POSITION 2: Let (V,@,I) be a symmetric monoidal category, and=0Asuppose tha=
t the forgetful functor U : Mon(V,@,I)--->V is split epi in=0Athe (1-)categ=
ory of tensor categories and functors. =A0Then I is initial=0Aand @ is coca=
rtesian.=0A=0ANot only is Proposition 2 true, but its truth implies that of=
=0AProposition 1: the hypothesis of Proposition 2 requires that m_I and=0Ae=
_I be the canonical isos, and that m_{A@B} and e_{A@B} be related to=0Am_A@=
m_B and e_A@e_B in the usual way; namely, via the canonical isos=0AA@A@B@B-=
->A@B@A@B and I-->I@I, respectively. =A0This evidently follows=0Afrom the h=
ypothesis of Proposition 1.=0A=0ABut it turns out that the hypothesis of Pr=
oposition 2 is still much=0Astronger than is required. =A0For instance, tho=
se parts which refer to=0Am_I, e_I, and e_{A@B} are entirely superfluous, a=
nd the part referring=0Ato m_{A@B} is only used to establish the following =
property, which=0Adoes not even refer to the symmetry of (V,@,I).=0A=0A(*) =
id_A@e_B@e_A@id_B splits m_{A@B}=0A(modulo the canonical iso A@B-->A@I@I@B)=
=0A=0AHence we arrive at the following.=0A=0APROPOSITION 3: Let (V,@,I) be =
a monoidal category, and suppose that=0Athe forgetful functor U : Mon(V,@,I=
)--->V is split epi in the=0A(1-)category of (mere) categories and functors=
. =A0If (*) holds, then I=0Ais initial and @ is cocartesian.=0A=0A=0ANow I =
will not write out a proof of Proposition 3, which is a tedious=0Aexercise =
known (at least in spirit) to many. =A0But I will demonstrate=0Athe necessi=
ty of (*) by means of the example promised above.=0A=0ALet V=3DSet, I=3D0, =
and @ be the tensor product defined by=0A=A0=A0A@B =3D A + B + AxB.=0AThis =
``unusual'' symmetric monoidal structure on Set was discussed on=0Athe list=
  a few years ago in a thread initiated by Peter Selinger.=0A=0AI don't reme=
mber whether it was mentioned at the time, but monoids in=0A(Set,@,I) are t=
he same thing as semigroups in (Set,x)---i.e.,=0Asemigroups in the most ord=
inary sense of the word. =A0For if m : AxA-->A=0Ais associative, then so is=
  [id_A,id_A,m] : A@A-->A. =A0Moreover, the=0Aunique map 0-->A is indeed a u=
nit for any map A@A-->A of the form=0A[id_A,id_A,f]. =A0Conversely, every m=
onoid in (Set,@,0) is of this form.=0A=0AIn this manner, we obtain an isomo=
rphism between Mon(Set,@,I) and Sgp=0Ain the 1-category of mere categories,=
  which, moreover, commutes with=0Athe two ``underlying set'' functors. =A0B=
ut U:Sgp-->Set is a split epi=0Athat is not invertible; for instance, one h=
as the ``left band =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0=A0=0Afunctor'' Set-->Sgp which assig=
ns to each set A, the semigroup (A,p_l)=0Awith p_l(a,b)=3Da. =A0(There is, =
of course, also a ``right band functor''=0Awhich also splits U.)=0A=0AThis =
is the promised counter-example to Proposition 0. =A0It is not a=0Acounter-=
example to Proposition 3, however, because the left band=0Afunctor violates=
  (*). =A0Let f_{A,B} denote the endomorphism of A@B=0Adefined by composing =
the following three arrows:=0A=A0=A0the canonical iso A@B-->A@I@I@B=0A=A0=
=A0id_A@e_B@e_A@id_B=0A=A0=A0m_{A@B}=0A---then f_{A,B} is a non-trivial ide=
mpotent on A@B (not the identity,=0Aas demanded by (*)). =A0Specificially, =
it maps a pair (a,b) in third=0Asummand of A@B to its first component a in =
the first summand of A@B.=0ANote that A+B is the split of this idempotent.=
=0A(Obviously, the right band functor also violates (*).)=0A=0AThis situati=
on is typical: in fact, it is easy to show that the maps=0Af_{A,B}, as defi=
ned above, are always idempotents; moreover, the=0Afollowing generalisation=
  of Proposition 3 also holds.=0A=0APROPOSITION 4: Let (V,@,I) be a monoidal=
  category, and suppose that=0Athe forgetful functor U : Mon(V,@,I)--->V is =
split epi in the=0A(1-)category of (mere) categories and functors. =A0Then =
I is initial,=0Aand if each of the idempotents f_{A,B} is split by some obj=
ect=0AS_{A,B}, then V has coproducts given by S_{A,B}.=0A=0AIn general, I g=
uess a monoidal category (V,@,I) for which the=0Aforgetful functor U : Mon(=
V,@,I)--->V is split epi is what a computer=0Ascientist might call a ``mode=
l of sum types without beta-reduction''?=0AI.e., there are maps fst : A-->A=
@B and snd : B-->A@B and a copairing=0Aoperation [,] satisfying fst[a,b]=3D=
a, snd[a,b]=3Db, but not generally=0A[fst c,snd c]=3Dc.=0A=0AThat is all.=
