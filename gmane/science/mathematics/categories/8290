Dear ?categories? readers,

This is to draw your attention to the recently published book

?MONOIDAL TOPOLOGY --  A Categorical Approach to Order, Metric , and
Topology?,

edited by Dirk Hofmann, Gavin J. Seal and Walter Tholen. It appeared in
the ?Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Its Applications? series of
Cambridge University Press, as vol. 153; see

www.cambridge.org/9781107063945


This 500-page book gives a rather self-contained introduction to the
subjects mentioned in its title, including category theory itself. The
list of contents below (including chapter authors and lengths of
chapters) may describe best to you what to expect. Largely absent is a
treatment of (Cauchy-Lawvere-type) completeness which, together with
other more advanced themes, is to be treated in a follow-up book.

Regards,
Walter
