Postdoc in CREDO project

The position is within the IST-33826 research project CREDO "Modeling and
analysis of evolutionary structures for distributed services". The project
aims at the development and application of an integrated suite of tools
for compositional modeling, testing, and validation of software for
evolving networks of dynamically reconfigurable components.
More information
on this project can be found at http://www.cwi.nl/projects/credo.

The candidate is expected to work on a object-oriented software
development method and architecture to support the
dynamic composition of highly reconfigurable
component-based software systems. The method structures
applications as a network of adaptive concurrent computational tasks that
interact using mobile channels. The research focusses on studying:

(i) the effects of runtime reconfiguration of the network of mobile channels,
and
(ii) the effects runtime changes/upgrades of the computational tasks.


In addition, the applicability of light-weight and automated verification and
model checking techniques and tools will be evaluated in a real-world
case study.

The candidate should have a PhD degree and a background in software engineering,
concurrency and distributed systems, and practical software
development or formal methods.

The postdoc is offered a full-time position for the remaining
duration of the CREDO project (till September 2009).
To ensure intensive knowledge transfer from industry to university and
vice versa the position will be hosted by
the research group on coordination languages
of the Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science
(CWI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and
Almende BV which is one of the case study partners in the project.

To apply, please send your letter of application,
together with curriculum vitae, and possible letters of references to

Alfons Salden (alfons@almende.com) and Frank de Boer (F.S.de.Boer@cwi.nl).
