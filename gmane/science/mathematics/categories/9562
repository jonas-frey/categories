Hi all,

I=E2=80=99ve recently learned that Zentralblatt and the Mathematics =
Reviews are collaborating to revise the Mathematics Subject =
Classifications (MSC) for 2020. The current MSC2010 codes were a =
revision of the original MSC2000 codes. You can read more about this =
here:

=
https://blogs.ams.org/beyondreviews/2016/07/26/msc2020-mathematics-subject=
-classification-update/ =
<https://blogs.ams.org/beyondreviews/2016/07/26/msc2020-mathematics-subjec=
t-classification-update/>

The editors of zbMath and MR are inviting suggestions from the community =
as part of this process and I think category theory should weigh in =
about the 3- and 5-digit subject classifications housed under =E2=80=9C18.=
=E2=80=9D This might not be the most important thing in the world but on =
the other hand, I could imagine working as a mathematician whose primary =
research area is (say) 55 or 3, searching for MSC codes to add to a =
paper before uploading to the arXiv, finding a particularly apt one =
under 18, and then gradually over many years of this starting to think =
of myself as a category theorist, in part, too.=20

I=E2=80=99d rather not be the one to curate feedback regarding the MSC =
codes but if no other volunteer presents themselves, I=E2=80=99ll at =
least send an email summarizing the discussion that takes place here.=20

I=E2=80=99m appending some emails that came over the homotopy type =
theory list (which is how I first learned about the classification =
update) as an illustration of the kind of discussion that I hope we=E2=80=99=
ll have in category theory.

Best,
Emily

general) [or Martin-L=C3=B6f type theory], and 03B17 Homotopy type =
theories (Dependent type theories from a homotopical point of view)
>=20

Univalent mathematics
>=20

Infinity-topos theory and the relations to HoTT/UF don't really fit in =
the existing categories there, either.
