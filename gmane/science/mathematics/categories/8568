One had better take care to note explicitly how to compose maps to =

and from the newly adjoined "zero object", if following Yetter's idea,

For, given a and b objects in D and writing z for the newly adjoined zero=

object, what are we to take for compositions  a --> * --> b ? Or were we =

also to adjoin "zero maps" z_(a,b) to each existing homset D(a, b), and =

then set these compositions all equal to those new zero maps?

That suggests Yetter really meant to propose forming the free *pointed* =

category with zero object freely engendered by D ... or maybe that's what=
  =

his words already meant to convey? Apologies if I was deaf to that tone :=
