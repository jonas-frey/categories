I don't this this works: if (g .g') is in the domain of the partial
functor and g is not, then g will be sent to 0 by the extension of the
partial functor, hence g.g' will also be sent to 0 which shouldn't be the
case because it is in the domain of the functor.

Also it is not entirely clear to me if the original question wanted
functor defined on a full subcategory or on an arbitrary sub-category. But
in both case, my opinion would be that the only reasonable notion is to
talk about "partial natural transformations" which are defined on a
subcategory included in the domain of definition of both functor (and
hence are natural transformation between ordinary functor).


Best wishes,
Simon Henry.
