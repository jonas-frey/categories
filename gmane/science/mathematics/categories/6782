Can we do history of category theory without considering history leading=20
to category theory? Is history an attachment of subhistories, or are=20
there paths that can be followed, and how do we teach these things to=20
young researchers? What I say is I like the '... and foundations of=20
mathematics'.

I always wondered if the term 'categorical this-and-that' every once=20
in a while should be considered with its counterpart 'this-and-thatical=20
category theory'. It's also about meta and object languages, I believe.
And sometimes categorists 'internalize', so that the roles of meta and=20
object ar blurred. Isn't a topos basically a 'logical category', where=20
'categorical logic' is something else? 'Topological category' is not the=20
same as 'categorical topology', and so on.

Also, 'categories in computer science' is too general. Still, most of=20
categories, used in recognized areas in computer science, relate to logic=
=20
in one way or the other, and to logic in a broad sense. Sometimes we also=
=20
say computer science has given many interesting problems for category=20
theory. I don't think this is really true in such a phrasing. What has=20
happened is that computer scientist in their work to formalize computable=
=20
logic and computability has been forced to go back to foundations of=20
mathematics in order to understand what is really going on. Computer=20
scientists, however, usually don't bother to formalize something they=20
already 'understand' (type theory is a good example), where a
mathematicians refuses to understand before it's formalized (that's why=20
there isn't any mathematical type theory).

Yes, we can. We can do history of category theory without considering=20
history leading to category theory. But why should we? And how does it=20
help to bring out all flavours of things we are still working on? Will=20
this history writing provide me with those utensils I need for things I=20
need to do. Or do I have to go elsewhere to look for it?

History writing is also a bit dangerous as it almost says this is now the=
=20
state-of-the-art, and if you don't play your etudes properly you are not=20
allowed to play structure and provide interpration. Talent is=20
thereby often surpressed, and mostly by teachers who really never=20
understood counterpoint anyway.

So what I really say is I like the '... and foundations of mathematics'.=20
Keeping meta and object apart, and category theory taught me how to=20
do that, is important for logic and foundations, as we know e.g. from=20
G=F6del numbering and creating sentences about it. To which logic these=20
sentences belong, nobody ever told me, so please do.

Best regards,

Patrik
