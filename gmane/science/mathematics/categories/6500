Dear Mike=2C

I have no objection to anything you actually say. Yes=2C of course any func=
tor is an anafunctor and=2C under AC=2C every anafunctor is isomorphic to a=
  functor. But that is what I meant.=A0It was just that=2C emphasizing the f=
act that anafunctors generalize functors (without AC)=2C I wanted to note t=
hat distributors (not necesarily representable) also do=2C even with AC=2C =
and that in this alone lies their importance=2C plus the fact that they can=
  be composed etc. I do not intend to modify your excellent exposition of an=
afunctors=2C a subject that I "learnt" just by reading it. I did not mean i=
t as a criticism.

Many thanks=2C
Marta
