I think, judging by comments so far, that there are basically two
goals concealed within "this project". One is to write an outline of
category theory as it seems to us now; the other is to write a history
of category theory, and, specifically, a history of who influenced whom.
Both of these are very worth doing, but the second is much more
difficult.

It's difficult mainly because it entails recovering a consistent history
from people's reminiscences, and these will not be consistent with
each other: they will be inconsistent not just because people's memories
are not accurate, but because everyone has remained active in the field
and they alter their memories according to what they think now. This is
probably especially true of mathematicians, because mathematicians
always rephrase other people's stuff in their own terms: it's how they
come to understand it. (Remember Goethe's remark, "Mathematicians are
like Frenchmen: if you tell them something, they rephrase it in their
own language, and you cannot understand it any more"? Well,
mathematicians do that to each other as well as to non-mathematicians).

The history is hard to do, but also potentially very valuable: it would
show how a revolution in mathematics took place. Hard work, though.

And *not* in the form of a Wiki, because Wikis deal with contradictions
between documents by erasing one document in favour of the other. (I
know, you can always look back in edit history, but it still relegates
one of the testimonies to the sidelines: you might well be in a
situation where you just have more than one testimony, and where it
would not be sensible to prefer one to the other).
