I imagine that omega-categories, however defined, will be a locally
c-presentable category (c=cardinal of the continuum) in the sense of
Gabriel-Ulmer, equivalently complete and c-accessible in the sense of
Makkai-Pare and hence cocomplete.  In other words, the colimit will grow
but not by much.  Actually, aleph_1 is all you are really going to need.
