  2012 is Open for Registration!

The fifth North American Summer School in Logic, Language, and
Information, NASSLLI 2012, will be hosted at the University of Texas
at Austin, on June 18-22, 2012.

http://nasslli2012.com/

NASSLLI is a one-week summer school aimed at graduate students and
advanced undergraduates in Philosophy, Computer Science, Mathematics,
Linguistics, Psychology and related fields, especially students with
interdisciplinary interests or whose research crosses traditional
boundaries between these subject areas. The summer school is loosely
modeled on the long-running ESSLLI series in Europe and will consist
of 5 sessions of 90 minute courses each day during the week of June
18-22, followed by a Turing Symposium on June 23 celebrating the first
centenary of Alan Turing's birth, and the 13th Texas Linguistics
Society conference on June 23, 24.

Registration fees: academic discount rate $175; professional rate
$400. Student scholarships will be available for 50 students
(http://nasslli2012.com/scholarships; application deadline: February
29). Scholarships include registration and may include a further
subsidy for travel and accommodation.

NASSLLI instructors present both basic and advanced work in their
disciplines, so courses appeal not only to graduate students and
exceptionally advanced undergraduates, but also to post-docs and
researchers in related fields. The summer school provides a unique
opportunity for students to learn from prominent scholars and meet
others from the active community of interdisciplinary philosophy,
computer science, linguistics and psychology researchers in the US and
Europe.

We expect over 200 participants, and in addition to classes in the
daytime, the evenings will have social events and plenary lectures. UT
Austin is a large research university in Austin, Texas which is widely
agreed to be one of the most exciting cities in the US and is the
self-styled "Live Music Capital of the World." We aim to make NASSLLI
fun.
