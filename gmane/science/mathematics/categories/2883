In reply to P. May's message.

I do not know of any work on "pseudo triple category".

On the other hand, the pseudo double category  Rng  of rings, =20
homomorphisms and bimodules
is briefly considered in our first work on pseudo double categories, =20
subsection 5.3

    M. Grandis - R. Par=E9, Limits in double categories, Cah. Topol. =20
G=E9om. Diff. Cat=E9g. 40 (1999), 162-220

as a substructure of the  pseudo double category of Ab-categories, Ab-=20=

functors and Ab-profunctors.

As an interesting construction, in this pseudo double category:
- the "tabulator" of a bimodule  u: R -+-> S  (u  is a left-R,  right-=20=

S  bimodule) (i.e., its double limit) can be constructed as a ring of =20=

triangular 2x2 matrices, with "matrix product"

   r  x     r'  x'        rr'   rx'+xs'
         .           =3D
   0  s     0   s'        0       ss'

(with  r. r' in R,  s, s' in S  and  x, x'  in  u).

Tabulators are crucial for double limits, since all of them can be =20
constructed from double products, double equalisers and tabulators.
[  In a bicategory, the tabulator (of the vertical identity of A) is =20
the cotensor  2*A,  and the previous result amounts to the =20
construction of weighted limits, in
   R.H. Street, Limits indexed by category valued 2-functors, J. Pure =20=

Appl. Algebra 8 (1976), 149-181.  ]
