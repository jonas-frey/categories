Subject: inquiry in re: citations and (fwd)

Dear Professor Stasheff,

Your message has been forwarded to my attention.

Reference lists appear in MathSciNet from journals included in the Mathematical
Reviews Citation Database. These journals are selected through an editorial
process that includes approval by the Mathematical Reviews Editorial Committee
(MREC). Citation Database reference list journals are reexamined each year in
October. The list of current Citation Database reference list journals can be
found at: http://www.ams.org/mrcitations/journal_list.html.

Please feel free to send me specific examples of journals you might have in
mind and I will forward them to MREC for their consideration. Let me know
if you have further questions.

Sincerely,
Calista Stafford

Subject: problem with citations?

I am told that according to Mathematical Reviews, the citations in
Category Theory journals are not citations!

If true, can something be done about it?

thanks

jim
