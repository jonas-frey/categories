British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science
Bath, UK
24th-27th March 2013
http://cs.bath.ac.uk/bctcs2013

FIRST CALL FOR CONTRIBUTED TALKS AND PARTICIPATION

Deadline for application for bursaries: 28th February 2013
Deadline for abstract submission: 10th March 2013
Deadline for registration: 10th March 2013

The 29th British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science will be
hosted by the Department of Computer Science, University of Bath,
from 24th to 27th March 2013.

The purpose of BCTCS is to provide a forum in which researchers in
theoretical computer science can meet, present research findings, and
discuss developments in the field. It also aims to provide an
environment in which PhD students can gain experience in presenting
their work, and benefit from contact with established researchers.

25 fully-funded PhD Student Bursaries are available, covering UK
travel, accommodation at University rate, and full registration.
It is easy to apply for one. Please see the website for details. We
are grateful to the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research for
sponsoring these bursaries.

The scope of the colloquium includes all aspects of theoretical
computer science, including automata theory, algorithms, complexity
theory, semantics, formal methods, concurrency, types, languages and
logics. Both computer scientists and mathematicians are welcome to
attend, as are participants from outside of the UK.

The colloquium features both invited and contributed talks. This
year's invited speakers are

Susanne Albers, Humboldt-Universit=E4t zu Berlin, the LMS-sponsored
keynote speaker in Discrete Mathematics

Samson Abramsky, University of Oxford

Assia Mahboubi, =C9cole Polytechnique, Paris

plus a representative of Altran UK; details to be announced.


Participants wishing to give 30 minute contributed talks may simply to
submit a title and abstract (100--300 words) by the deadline given
below.

Further details are available from the Colloquium website:
