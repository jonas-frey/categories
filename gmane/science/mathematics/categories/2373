This is a comment on one aspect of Jean Pradines' very interesting
posting of June 8. I quote a large part of it for reference:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

EXTRACT FROM JEAN'S POSTING:

Now what I really had in mind was not the purely algebraic (rather obviou=
s)
setting, but the study of quotients for the differentiable groupoids
(nowadays called smooth or Lie) introduced by Ehresmann in 1959, which ar=
e
groupoids in the category of manifolds.
The statement I had obtained (which again certainly cannot by any means b=
e
deduced from the general results of Ehresmann concerning topological or
structured groupoids) was published in 1966 in my Note (prealably submitt=
ed to Ehresmann and transmitted by him) :

-Th=E9orie de Lie pour les groupo=EFdes diff=E9rentiables. Relations entr=
e
propri=E9t=E9s locales et globales, CRAS (Paris), s=E9rie A, t.263, p.907=
-910, 19
d=E9cembre 1966-

in Th=E9or=E8me 5 (in this statement the Bourbaki term "subimmersion" is
improperly used and has to be understood in the more restricted acception
"submersion onto a submanifold" ; note also that the implication from 2=B0=
 to 1=B0 is valid only
when the fibres of the domain map of H are connected). (Note that in this=
 statement the algebraic theory of the two-sided quotient of a groupoid b=
y an invariant subgroupoid is implicitely considered as "well known" with=
out reference. This was in fact a diplomatic consequence of the above-men=
tionned conversation ! At least at that period it seems absolutely certai=
n that no reference did exist, and probably very few people, if any, had =
had the opportunity of thinking to that sort of questions, since the main=
 stream of categoricists were despising groupoids as beig trivial, since =
equvalent to groups).
The unpublished proof of this statement relied on a careful and rather
delicate study of the foliation defined by the two-sided cosets.
The very elegant proof for the case of Lie groups given in Serre, Lie
Algebras and Lie Groups (lecture in Harvard, 1964, p.LG 4.10-11), relying=
 on the so-called Godement's
theorem, works only for one-sided cosets and yields only the too special =
case
above-mentioned or more generally the statement of Proposition 2 in the
previous Note (which extends to groupoids the classical theory of homogen=
eous spaces for possibly non invariant subgroups).

It is clear that this last proof may be immediately written in a purely
diagrammatic way and remains valid in much more general contexts when an
abstract Godement's theorem is available. It turns out that this is the c=
ase
for most of (perhaps almost all)  the categories considered by "working
mathematicians", notably the abelian categories as well as toposes, the
category of topological spaces (with a huge lot of variants), the
category of Banach spaces, and many useful categories that are far from b=
eing complete.The precise definitions for what is meant by an abstract Go=
dement's theorem were given in my paper :

-Building Categories in which a Godement's theorem is available-
published in the acts of the Second Colloque sur l'Alg=E8bre des Cat=E9go=
ries,
Amiens 1975, Cahiers de Topologie....(CTGDC).

In this last paper I introduced the term "dyptique de Godement" for a
category in which one is given two subcategories of "good mono's" and "go=
od
epi's" (playing the roles of embeddings and surmersions in Dif) such that=
 a formal Godement's theorem is valid.

These considerations explain why I was strongly motivated for adapting
Serre's diagrammatic proof to the case of two-sided cosets (since such a =
proof would immediately extend the theory of quotients for groupoids in v=
arious non complete categories used by "working mathematicians", yielding=
 a lot of theorems completely out of the range of Ehresmann's general the=
ory of structured groupoids). However this was
achieved only in 1986 in my Note :

-Quotients de groupo=EFdes diff=E9rentiables, CRAS (Paris), t.303, S=E9ri=
e I, 1986, p.817-820.-

The proof requires the use of certain "good cartesian squares" or "good p=
ull back
squares", which, though they are not the most general pull back's existin=
g
in the category Dif of manifolds, cannot be obtained by the (too
restrictive) classical condition of transversality. Though written in the
framework of the category Dif (in order not to frighten geometers, but wi=
th
the risk of frightening categoricists), this paper is clearly thought in
order to be easily generalizable in any category where a suitable set of
distinguished pull back's is available , assuming only some mild stabilit=
y properties.

In this paper I introduced the seemingly natural term of "extensors" for
naming those functors between (structured) groupoids which arise from the
canonical projection of a groupoid onto its quotient by a normal
subgroupoid. Equivalent characterizations are given.(I am ignoring if ano=
ther term is being used in the literature).This notion is resumed and use=
d in my paper :

-Morphisms between spaces of leaves viewed as fractions-
CTGDC, vol.XXX-3 (1989),p. 229-246

which again is written in the smooth context, but using purely diagrammat=
ic descriptions (notably for Morita equivalences and generalized morphism=
s) allowing immediate extensions for various categories.
As a prolongation of this last paper, I intend in future papers to give a
description of the category of fractions obtained by inverting those
extensors with connected fibres. This gives a weakened form of Morita
equivalence which seems basic for understanding the transverse structure =
of
foliations with singularities.

In response to Jean's paper

[QGD] Quotients de groupo=EFdes diff=E9rentiables, CRAS (Paris), t.303,=20
S=E9rie I, 1986, p.817-820.=20

Philip Higgins and I wrote two papers ([HM90a] and [HM90b] below)=20
dealing with general quotients of Lie (=3Ddifferentiable) groupoids=20
and Lie algebroids. Our starting point was the idea that:

``a morphism in a given category is entitled to be called a quotient=20
map if and only if it is entirely determined by data on the domain''

(Perhaps this will seem naive to true categorists, but I write as an=20
end user of category theory, not a developer.)=20

I would summarize [QGD] as proving that the `regular extensors' are
quotient maps in the category of Lie groupoids. [HM90b] then showed,
by extending the notion of kernel, that in fact all extensors are
quotient maps in the category of Lie groupoids.

Philip and I used the term `fibration' for what Jean calls an
`extensor'; these maps satisfy a natural smooth version of the=20
notion of `fibration of groupoids' introduced by Ronnie Brown=20
in 1970 (building on work of Frolich, I think). (Throughout this=20
post, I assume base maps to be surjective submersions.)

There is unlikely to be a more general class of quotient maps for
Lie groupoids: the fibration condition on a groupoid morphism=20
$F : G \to H$ is exactly what is needed to ensure that any product=20
in the codomain is determined by a product in the domain: given=20
elements $h, h'$ of $H$ which are composable, one wants to be able=20
to write $h =3D F(g)$ and $h' =3D F(g')$ in such as way that $gg'$ will=20
exist and determine $hh'$; the fibration condition is the weakest=20
simple condition which ensures this.=20

Fibrations of Lie groupoids are not determined by their kernel in=20
the usual sense (=3D union of the kernels of the maps of vertex=20
groups); one also requires the kernel pair of the base map, and the=20
action of this (considered as a Lie groupoid) on the manifold of=20
one--sided cosets of the domain. This data, which Philip and I=20
called a `kernel system' is equivalent to a suitably well--behaved
congruence on the domain groupoid. Though more complicated than the
usual notion of kernel, the notion of normal subgroupoid system=20
gives an exact extension of the `First Isomorphism Theorem'.=20

We also showed that regular fibrations (=3D Jean's regular extensors)
are precisely those in which the additional data can be deduced from
the standard kernel and the base map; in the regular case the two=20
step quotient can be reduced to a single quotient consisting of=20
double cosets (as Jean remarks in his post). The congruences=20
corresponding to regular fibrations are those which, regarded as=20
double groupoids, satisfy a double source condition.=20

A good example of a fibration which is not regular is the division=20
map $\delta: (g,h)\mapsto gh^{-1}$ in a group $G$, considered as a=20
groupoid morphism from the pair groupoid $G\times G$ to the group $G$.

All of this (for Lie algebroids, as well as for Lie groupoids and=20
for vector bundles) is in the two papers referenced below. There is=20
also a full account coming in my book `General Theory of Lie=20
groupoids and Lie algebroids' (CUP) which should be appearing=20
in the next few months.=20
