Whoa! This simply can't work. Whatever the final coalgebra for N x (-)
looks like, it must (thanks to Lambek) be isomorphic to N x itself,
and therefore (since equality for N is decidable) must have lots of
complemented subobjects {0} x itself, {1} x itself, ... The point of
the continuity theorem for functions R --> R is that there are toposes
in which R has *no* nontrivial complemented subobjects -- indeed, in
which the sentence

(\forall S : PR)((\forall x : R)((x \in S) \vee \neg(x\in S))
     \implies ((S = R)\vee (S = \emptyset)))

is valid. This is purely a matter of logic: it has nothing to do with
the order, topological or any other sort of structure carried by
the final coalgebra. So invoking Alexandroff and Scott isn't going to
help at all. The only way to get round it (apart from using glue)
is to replace N by some "nonstandard natural number object" having no
nontrivial complemented subobjects -- but where you get that from, I
don't know.
