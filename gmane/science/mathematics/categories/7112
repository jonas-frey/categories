SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

11th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction (MPC=
  2012)
Madrid, Spain, 25-27 June 2012
http://babel.ls.fi.upm.es/mpc2012



BACKGROUND

The biennial MPC conferences aim to promote the development of mathematic=
al
principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical and effective i=
n the
process of constructing computer programs, broadly interpreted.

The 2012 MPC conference will be held in Madrid, Spain, from 25th to 27th =
June
2012.  The previous conferences were held in Twente, The Netherlands (198=
9),
Oxford, UK (1992), Kloster Irsee, Germany (1995), Marstrand, Sweden (1998=
),
Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000), Dagstuhl, Germany (2002), Stirling, UK (2=
004,
colocated with AMAST), Kuressaare, Estonia (2006, colocated with AMAST),
Marseille, France (2008), and Qu=E9bec City, Canada (2010, colocated with
AMAST).


TOPICS

Papers are solicited on mathematical methods and tools put to use in prog=
ram
construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to support for
program construction in programming languages and systems. The notion of
"program" is broad, from algorithms to hardware.  Some typical areas are =
type
systems, program analysis and transformation, programming-language semant=
ics,
security, and program logics. Theoretical contributions are welcome, prov=
ided
that their relevance to program construction is clear. Reports on applica=
tions
are welcome, provided that their mathematical basis is evident.


INVITED SPEAKERS

    * Gilles Barthe, IMDEA Software Institute (http://software.imdea.org/p=
eople/gilles.barthe/)
    * Dan Ghica, University of Birmingham (http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~drg/)
    * Tony Hoare, Microsoft Research (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/=
people/thoare/)


IMPORTANT DATES

    * Submission of abstracts       09 January 2012
    * Submission of full papers     16 January 2012
    * Notification to authors:      19 March 2012
    * Final version:                16 April 2012


SUBMISSION

Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text, 10 to 20 lines) must =
be
submitted by 09 January 2012. Full papers (pdf) adhering to the LaTeX lln=
cs
style must be submitted by 16 January 2012. There is no official page lim=
it,
but authors should strive for brevity. The web-based system EasyChair wil=
l be
used for submission (http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmpc2012=
).

Papers must report previously unpublished work, and not be submitted
concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. Accepted pa=
pers
must be presented at the conference by one of the authors. Please feel fr=
ee to
write to mpc2012@easychair.org with any questions about academic matters.

The proceedings of MPC 2012 will be published in Springer-Verlag's Lectur=
e
Notes in Computer Science series, as have all the previous editions. Auth=
ors
of accepted papers will be expected to transfer copyright to Springer for=
  this
purpose. After the conference, we plan that the authors of the best paper=
s
will be invited to submit revised versions to a special issue of the Else=
vier
journal Science of Computer Programming.
