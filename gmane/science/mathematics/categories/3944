In fact, I think that the process of moving from rings to lattices of ide=
als=20
should be seen in two stages.  The first stage is to observe that the fun=
ctor=20
Ab ---> Sup which maps an abelian group to its lattice of subobjects come=
s
equipped with a natural monoidal structure.  [Sup denotes the category of=
=20
complete lattices and sup-homomorphisms.]  Thus monoids in Ab (rings) get
mapped to monoids in Sup (quantales).  [Of course, one can replace Ab, no=
t=20
just by CMon, but by other interesting categories, such as Ban.]

The second stage is to pare the quantale of all (additive) subgroups of a=
=20
ring down to that of ideals; but (left-, right-, two-sided) ideals are, b=
y
definition, precisely the (left-, right-, two-sided) elements of the=20
quantale of subgroups, so all that remains to do is properly describe thi=
s
process of paring an arbitrary quantale to its "subquantale" of two-sided
elements (subquantale in the sense of sub-semigroup, not sub-monoid). =20

Restricting to the category of commutative quantales---which I shall adop=
t=20
as the case of interest, for the purposes of the present discussion (sinc=
e=20
it started out with the ring of integers)---we see that this functor is l=
eft
adjoint to the forgetful functor from the category of {commutative quanta=
les
whose unit is top}.  [The problem with the general case is that the=20
"obvious" unit map: x |-> T&x&T (where T denotes top and & is quantale
multiplication) need not be a quantale homomorphism; there appear to be=20
several ways of fixing this, and I do not yet know which is the best.]

The nice thing about this approach is that one then recognises the second
stage as leading naturally to a third: namely, collapsing down to the fra=
me=20
of radical ideals (which is the topology of the space of primes I referre=
d=20
to in my previous post).  In particular, if one regards this third stage =
as
erroneous=20

> The distributive lattice of radical ideals is refined to the monoidal
> poset of all ideals.

then one should probably regard the second stage as equally erroneous
---which is the position that the quantale theory community has largely=20
agreed upon. =20

As to the question of "why?", I have a very biased and unscientific=20
answer: Sup is the most awesome category.

Cheers,
Jeff Egger.
