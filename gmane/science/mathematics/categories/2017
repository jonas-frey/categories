UNION COLLEGE MATHEMATICS CONFERENCE

Saturday and Sunday                             Schenectady
September 29-30, 2001                           New York

This is a preliminary announcement for the tenth Union College Mathematics
Conference.  This year the conference topics are category theory and
algebraic topology.

In addition to plenary lectures, of interest to the entire Conference
audience, there will also be shorter contributed talks in parallel
sessions.  Anyone interested in giving such a talk should contact one of
the organizers.

The meeting will begin with an evening reception on Friday, September 28,
and end on Sunday afternoon.  A more detailed notice  will be mailed later
this summer.  Information will also be available at the Union College
Mathematics Department website (www.math.union.edu) in July.  We have
included information about hotels at the end of this message in case you
wish to make reservations early.

Union College is centrally located in New York's capital district about 10
miles from the Albany International Airport, easily accessible by train
from NYC, and just 3 to 4 hours by car from NYC, Boston, and Montreal.

We hope to see you in September!
