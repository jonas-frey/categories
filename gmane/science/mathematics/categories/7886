Dear Jamie,

Here is one possible proof. The 2-category of categories with
biproducts and zero objects and functors preserving them is
biequivalent to the 2-category of CMon-enriched categories with finite
coproducts and arbitrary CMon-functors between them (because finite
coproducts are absolute in the CMon-enriched world).

If C is a category with biproducts, a zero object, and monoidal with
left and right duals, then it is in particular monoidal biclosed;
whence the tensor product A (x) (-) : C ----> C preserves colimits, so
in particular biproducts and the zero object. Via the above
biequivalence, it follows that A (x) (-) : C ---> C is a CMon-enriched
functor for each A. Thus given a map f : A --->B and objects X,Y in C,
we have mappings

C(X,Y) ---> C(A(x)X, A(x)Y) ---> C(A(x)X, B(x)Y)

in CMon, whose underlying mapping in Set sends g : X ---> Y to f (x) g
: A(x)X --> B(x)Y. That these mappings lift to CMon expresses
precisely the distributivity you state above.

Best,
Richard
