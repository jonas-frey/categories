In view of this would it be fair to say that coherence is not a notion
intrinsic to category theory, but rather arises from the traditional
set theoretic presentation (or at least point of view) of category theory?

Much the same can surely be said of naturality, whose abstract essence
is that of 2-cells but which is standardly presented concretely, where
the interchange axiom becomes a not entirely trivial theorem.
