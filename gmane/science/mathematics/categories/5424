yes, I meant this paper, I apologize for the wrong reference.
Actually, I literally translated the Russian translation of the title
(that I remembered) back into English. The result turned out to be not
an identity, and even not an isomorphism

Here's an absolutely rational explanation. Suppose that once upon a
time there were two classes of people, say, A and B, with different
logics and aesthetics and criteria of elegance. Correspondingly, they
had developed different mathematics, MA and MB. It so happened that
A-aesthetics and thinking based on it turned out to be inadequate for
the reality, and people A were eaten by saber-toothed tigers.
Mathematics MA was forgotten and its traces can now be found in
ancient archives only. I'm afraid that the A-destiny is awaiting the
opponents of cat theory and their non-categorical math. :) [Do not
take it seriously, I understand that category theory is just a good
mathematics, not a
different mathematics].

Happy Holidays!
