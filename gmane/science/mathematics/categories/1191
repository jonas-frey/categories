          International Workshop on "REAL-TIME CONSTRAINTS"
                             (RTC'99)

                       Second Call For Papers
            http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~eric/cp99-rtc/

                   A Post-Conference Workshop of
     the 5th International Conference on Principles and Practice
                 of Constraint Programming (CP'99)

            October 16, 1999, Alexandra, Virginia, USA

A CP'99 post-conference international workshop on REAL-TIME CONSTRAINTS is 
being organized at CP'99. Real-time systems and applications all require 
stringent timing constraints for correct operation. Such real-time constraints 
are often difficult to design as well as verify. Varied techniques that deal
with real-time constraints have been proposed in various application domains.
This workshop will try to find a consensus in the various techniques that
appear in different domains related to real-time constraint specification, 
programming, design, validation, and verification.

All topics related to real-time constraints are invited. 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Specification of Real-Time Constraints   - Formal Methods
- Modeling of Real-Time Constraints        - Industrial Techniques
- Programming of Real-Time Constraints     - Case Studies
- Verification of Real-Time Constraints    - IP / Virtual Components
- Testing of Real-Time Constraints         - Embedded Systems
- Real-Time Constraint Tools               - Hardware-Software Coverification

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS: 
To submit a paper to the workshop, please do the following:
(1) Prepare a manuscript in either PDF or PostScript format. Manuscripts 
    should be already in camera-ready format: a maximum of 6 pages (A4 or 
    letter), font size 10 pt or 11 pt, single-spaced, double-column, with
    the first page including paper title, author names, affiliations, e-mail
    addresses, a maximum 200-word abstract, and at least 5 keywords.
(2) Prepare a cover letter (an ascii-text e-mail) with the paper title,
    the corresponding author's name, mailing address, e-mail address, 
    and telephone/fax numbers, paper abstract, and keywords.
(3) E-mail the above two to: eric@iis.sinica.edu.tw .
    If electronic submission is not possible, please mail the above to the 
    postal address at the end.
(4) Important Dates:
    Submission Deadline:      August 20, 1999
    Acceptance Notification:  September 10, 1999
    Camera-Ready Papers:      September 20, 1999
(5) The workshop will span over one full day (October 16, 1999) 
    with paper presentations and group discussions.  All submissions will 
    be reviewed by at least 2 referees. Papers must not have been published
    previously. Only those accepted papers that are presented at the
    workshop will be published.  Workshop proceedings will be published 
    separately from the CP'99 proceedings. Both web publication and 
    hard-cover copies will be made available.
