Dear Andr=E9,=0A=0AI do not understand the point of your "test".  =0A=0AWha=
t Bob Par=E9 said, and which I agree with, is that equality =0Ais "okay" fo=
r small categories.  And as Paul Taylor wrote, =0Aby "small" what one reall=
y means is "internal".  =0A=0ASo, of course, it makes sense that V-internal=
 categories =0A(where V is a not-necessarily-braided monoidal category with=
 =0Adistributive coreflexive equalisers) should have a comonoid =0Aof objec=
ts.  =0A=0ABut this in no way contradicts the assertion that _large_ =0Acat=
egories should not have an equality relation between =0Aobjects---internal =
categories are tautologously small!  =0A=0ANot being as familiar with index=
ed categories/fibrations as=0AI ought to be, I tend to think of large categ=
ories in terms =0Aof enriched category theory.  Here, we see very clearly t=
hat =0Athe collection of objects has nothing whatsoever to do with =0Athe e=
nriching category V, and this is as it should be.=0A=0AIn fact, I suppose t=
hat it probably would make sense to =0Ageneralise enriched categories by ta=
king a (large) groupoid =0Aof objects (and _canonical_ isos, in the spirit =
of Par=E9 and =0ASchumacher) instead of a mere class.  I don't know if this=
 =0Ahas ever been done.  =0A=0AMy main point is that you are right in asser=
ting that a set =0Awithout an equality relation is not a set.  But the exac=
t =0Ameaning of large category is one whose objects do not =0Anecessarily f=
orm a set!  =0A=0AMorally speaking, "set" does mean "collection that has an=
 =0Aequality predicate", but this leaves open the possibility =0Athat there=
 are collections which do not have such a =0Apredicate, and which are there=
fore not sets.  These suffice =0Afor the purpose of large category theory--=
-for example, they =0Asuffice for the purpose of enriched categories; moreo=
ver, =0AFOLDS is explicitly based on these principles. =0A=0ACheers,=0AJeff=
