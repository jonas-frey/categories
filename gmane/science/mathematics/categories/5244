I do NOT believe that ETCS and CCAF "work perfectly well". Each of these =
involve
two foundational "layers", namely, the classical "bottom" and a categoric=
al
"superstructure". By the classical bottom I mean NOT an underlying Set th=
eory
but the "Elementary theory of categories" (ETC), i.e. a theory of categor=
ies
using the usual First-Order Logic (FOL) and relying on the standard
Hilbert-Tarski-style axiomatic method. I agree with John Mayberry and som=
e
other people who argue that this aximatic method alone assumes a basic no=
tion
of set or collection. Unlike Mayberry I don't think that this fact implie=
s that
the project of categorical foundations, as a alternative to and replaceme=
nt for
set-theoretic foundations, is futile. Recall that the axiomatic method we=
 are
talking about (which is, of cause, quite different from Euclid's method a=
nd
other earlier versions of axiomatic method) emerged together with Set the=
ory.
In order to make categorical foundations into a viable alternative of
set-theoretic foundations we still need to provide Category theory with a=
 new
axiomatic method rather than use the older axiomatic method as do ETCS an=
d
CCAF. Elements of this prospective axiomatic method are found in what I j=
ust
called the "categorical superstructure" of ETCS and CCAF but as far as th=
ese
theories are concerned the classical background (FOL+ETC) is indispensabl=
e.
This is why I say that ETCS and CCAF do NOT work perfectly weel as catego=
rical
foundations.
Building of "purely categorical" foundations remains an open problem. It =
is not
a matter of a ideological purity but a matter of complete "rebuilding" (M=
anin's
word) of foundations: in my view, such a rebuilding is healthy and refres=
hing
in any circumstances (unless it clashes severely with practice).
