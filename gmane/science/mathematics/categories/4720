[Note from moderator: For information, as publisher I have twice suggested
TAC to Thomson. Three years ago it was rejected after a long delay with no
explanation other than a reference to their "policy". When the suggestion
was renewed last summer via email and their web site mentioned below I
received no response at all, not even an acknowledgement, certainly no
gift card.]

Dear Colleagues,
   I wrote Thomson and asked how to find out what's covered, and also
how to request a journal be included. Below is a copy of the response
I received. I checked, and neither Cahiers nor T&AC are included (nor
is ENTCS, sad to say). I also took a brief look at the leading essay
on the ISI site about their rationalization for their selection
process. The bottom line in my view is that they provide this service
not for our needs, but for those who want quick and dirty guesstimates
of the importance of publications. Administrators like to use such
rankings, and publishers also focus on them, citing impact factor as a
major aspect of the importance of journals they publish. We can all go
to the site listed below to request that Cahiers and T&AC (and don't
forget ENTCS!!) be included, but I'm afraid this community is too
small to have an impact (sic) on this industry, so I think we should
look elsewhere for the needs we have to be met. Of course, there is
the lure of that $50 American Express gift card....
   Best regards,
   Mike Mislove
