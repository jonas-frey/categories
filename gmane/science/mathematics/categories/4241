Folk,

=20
At Fri, 15 Feb 2008 08:47:57 +0000 Philip Wadler srote,
"... please summarize the replies ... and send ... to the ... list?
... interested to see if you receive a positive reply."

I've counted 16 respondents!  The question is=20
answered well.  With my limited knowledge, the=20
summary probably fails to credit some of the=20
responses adequately but this is not intentional.
Thanks to everyone who replied!

5 messages mentioned Hyting-algebras.
Never heard of them.  Lawvere & Schanuel=20
do not mention them in the 1997 book. =20
Will store the terms for future reference.

Fred Linton wrote,
"... skeletal version of the full category
... having as only objects the ordinal numbers 0 and 1.

Here 0 x A =3D 0, 1 x A =3D A, 0^1 =3D 0, 0^0 =3D 1, 1^A =3D 1.
In other words, B x A =3D min(A, B), B^A =3D max(1-A, B)."

My product diagrams are at=20
  http://carnot.yi.org/category01.jpg
.

Now I can try to illustrate the uniqueness=20
of map objects according to L&S, page page 314,=20
Exercise 1.  Does this category have a name?  =20
Is Boolean Category sensible?

Two messages mentioned lambda calculus.
Another topic for future reference.

Stephen Lack asked "How small is small?=20
How explicit is explicit?"  Probably=20
several other readers wondered the same.
Fred's reply is small enough and explicit=20
enough to write out in detail.

One message addressed the term "concrete". =20
I referred to Concrete Categories in the=20
Wikipedia.

Matt Hellige mentioned categories a little=20
bigger than that described by Fred. =20
For instance, objects 0, 1, 2, 3.
Map A -> B exists iff A < B.

B x A =3D? min(A, B) =20
I should sketch the details of some of these=20
examples beyond the 0, 1 case above.

Andrej Bauer described Fred's category in the context=20
of Heyting algebra and noted a proof by=20
Peter Freyd.

Thorsten Altenkirch mentioned an equational=20
inconsistency which is beyond my present=20
grasp.

Apologies to anyone who's reply is not =20
addressed adequately.  If someone requests,=20
I can revise the summary and resubmit it.

Thanks,         ... Peter E.
