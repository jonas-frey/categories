Dear Peter,

I am deeply saddened by this news. Please convey my
sincere condolences to Keith's family.

I first met Keith in 1978, with the first of several
visits to Cape Town in 1986. On two occasions I stayed
for extended periods in his homes (once in Rondebosch
and once in Melkbosstrand). There was always lots of
walking on beaches.

We worked variously on Whitehead products, Hopf
invariants and generalizations of Toda brackets (often
jointly with Nobuyuki Oda and Heiner Kamps). He was
trained in classical homotopy theory methods but
eagerly embraced newer approaches. Beyond our
professional association he was a good friend.
It was a joy and privilege to have known him.

Cordially,

Howard Marcum
