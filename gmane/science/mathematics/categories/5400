I'm trying to expose my fellow programmers to the joys of category
theory, but none of them have a math or physics background (or even a
funcitonal programming background), which is where most of my
experience with CT has been.

What have been the major applications of category theory to computer
science that have affected programmers?  Are there new algorithms?
Are there really nice ways of solving certain problems?  The fact that
data types with equivalence classes of lambda terms between them form
a cartesian closed category doesn't seem to inspire them very much.
