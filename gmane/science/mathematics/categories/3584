grothendieck notion of strict epi (SGA4) is equivalent to the notion of
regular epi in the presence of the kernel-pair, but it makes
sense in the absence of pull-backs.

you can say that a strict epi is "stable under pullbacks" also in the
absence of pullbacks:

                     Z_i -------> X
                      |           |
                      |f_i        |f
                     \/     h     \/
                      Z --------> Y

a strict epi  f  is  universal  if  given any  h  there exists a strict
epi family f_i as indicated in the diagram.

this exactness property is as good as stability under pullbacks

i am afraid thought that you have different examples in mind.
