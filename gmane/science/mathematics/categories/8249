Dear Jean,=0A=
=0A=
I apologise for my ignorance of your work.=0A=
=0A=
I guess that an equivalence of categories P:X-->S is always a foliation, bu=
t not=0A=
a fibration, unless it is surjective on objects.=0A=

=0A=
Dear Ross, Dear all,=0A=
=0A=
In a recent mail I asked Ross if pseudo cartesian functors between pseudo f=
ibrations had been studied.=0A=
There are many generalizations of fibrations. Pseudo fibrations are only on=
e of them. But there are also prefibrations, defined by Grothendieck, but a=
lmost never considered, and pre foliations, which I  define here, which gen=
eralise greatly pre fibrations. For such pre foliatons, I define cartesian =
functors  and show that they have striking properties, most of which are no=
t known, even in the very special case of fibrations.=0A=
I thought this brief survey might interest you, in case you decide to study=
  seriously the properties of pseudo cartesian functors.=0A=
=0A=
Best regards to all,=0A=
