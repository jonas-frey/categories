Dear Emily,

many thanks for your message. It push me to precise some aspects of my =
link with the "op" things, with some words about your joint paper =
https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4520.=20

 	In fact in a talk at a the Louvain-la-Neuve's meeting in 2011, =
Category theory, algebra and geometry, 26-27 may 2011, I spoke on =
"Borromean Objects and Trijunctions". I do remember well that Eugenia =
was listening to this talk,
and so probably her attention was attracted on the notion of a =
trijunction (the notion you are explaining in your message). Some times =
later this was published in a paper "Trijunctions and Triadic Galois =
Connections" (Cahier Top. G=E9o. Diff. Cat, LIV-1 (2013), pp. 13-28) =
(accessible on my site : =
http://rene.guitart.pagesperso-orange.fr/publications.html). =46rom the =
summary, we can learn why I did so :=20
 	"In this paper we introduce the notion of a trijunction, which =
is related to a triadic Galois connection just as an adjunction is to a =
Galois connection. We construct the trifibered tripod associated to a =
trijunction, the
 	trijunction between toposes of presheaves associated to a =
discrete trifibration, and the generation of any trijunction by a =
bi-adjoint functor. While some examples are related to triadic Galois =
connections, to ternary relations, others are 	associated to some =
symmetric tensors, to toposes and algebraic universes".=20
Now it is interesting to understand how this was achieved, in two steps:=20=

1 - Firstly I read a paper by Biedermann, on triadic Galois connections, =
related to ternary relations as Galois connections of Ore between =
ordered sets are related to binary relations. Immediately I try to =
extend that from order sets to categories.
2 - Fortunately in the same time I was conducted to read again carefully =
the famous paper by Kan on Adjoint functor. There I observed that in =
fact he he is mainly working with tensors and Gom, i.e. with bifunctors =
;  and furthermore in the Mac Lane's book, the convenient lemma for =
parameterized adjunctions are reproduced. Then I notice that the perfect =
explicit ternary symmetry in Biedermann was in fact also implicit in =
Kan, but that only he "missed" to put the accent on it, by introducing =
the opposite of the opposite (E^op)^op in your message). So I did, and =
then I got the application to the descriptions of trifibrations and =
toposes, to the analysis clearly the system of functions or operations =
generated by a tripod.

So you can see that my motivations (to unified Kan and Biedermann at the =
level n =3D 3), in order to produce a functional analysis of tripod), =
seems rather different from yours (to enter in a game of general =
n-multiadjunctions).  Hence finally my question : to analyze the system =
of functions or operations generated by an n-pod, and to understand =
there the part play by the mysterious "op".

with my friendly greetings,

Ren=E9.
