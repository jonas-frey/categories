I don't know what to say about the suggestion that a circle and a line=20
make a sketch of which Euclidean plane geometry is a model.  I would thin=
k=20
you would need a point too, since intersections are crucial.  Maybe=20
complex projective geometry since then two lines intersect in one point=20
(unless they coincide), a line and a circle in two (unless they are=20
tangent or equal) and every pair of circles in four (ditto).  Maybe the=20
exceptions could be handled in some sketch.  At any rate, it wold e=20
interesting to try to sketch this in detail.  At any rate, I never though=
t=20
about this before.
