I give my opinion simultaneously to several postings;

Precisely, we should not accept a terminology just because it does not offend
anybody.

Jesus Christ !!, with this philosophy we could accept any ridiculous
terminology so far "it does not offend".

Terminologies may have an strong "ideological" connotation. To call something
"evil" it is not harmless, neither unintentional (do not forget the
unconscious part of the brain of those that promote "evil").

It also has a marketing attitude (compare with "catastrophe theory" to refer
to the classification of singularities of C^oo maps).

Well, I can not imagine the word "not kosher" to offend anybody if applied to
something that it is not accepted by the rules of a discipline.

(like constructivism, intuitionism, or "accept only concepts invariant by
equivalence").

Of course, if "not kosher = evil", then some people would not like it. But the
blame is in those that introduced the terminology "evil" to refer to something
which is not necessarily evil.

Well, certainly true what Andre says.

"evil" is a terminology so far used by some people, certainly not the
mathematical community. It has also the weakness to remain for ever within a
"subculture" that we do not want to be identified with category theory.

(Rene Thom had sufficiently strong contributions to mainstream mathematics to
impose his "catastrophe" terminology. This is not the case for the "evil"
terminology).

All the best to all, and welcome controversy !!.
