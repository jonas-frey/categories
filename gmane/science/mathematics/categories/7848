(resending, because categories@ only takes plain text; sorry for the
duplicate, Mike; also asked at
http://mathoverflow.net/questions/141022/naming-ambiguity-in-constructive-p=
ointwise-natural-transformations-and-whiskerin):
In the HoTT Book, the choice is made to talk about whiskering, rather
than horizontal composition, because horizontal composition is
ambiguous and only defined up to paths.  Naturally, there is left
whiskering and right whiskering, and I think these are well-known to
the category theory community.
When working on defining natural transformations pointwise, there is a
similar problem, and I would like to know if there are good names for
the two variants.
More precisely, given precategories C, C', D, C', functors F, G : C ->
D, functors F', G' : C' -> D', and natural transformations T : F -> G
and T' : F' -> G', and letting [A, B] denote the precategory of
functors from A to B if A and B are precategories, and letting [F, G]
denote the functor [C, D] -> [C', D'] if F is a functor C -> D and G
is a functor C' -> D', we can form the pointwise natural
transformations [F, F'] -> [G, F'] and [F, F'] -> [F, G'].  Is there a
good and/or standard name for these natural transformations?  (Is one
of them obviously "left" and the other "right"?) I'll probably end up
notating the first as [T, F'] and the second as [F, T'], but I'd still
like good names for them.

The reason I called them "pointwise", I think, was because I used them
to construct the fact that if F =E2=8A=A3 G, then [id, F] =E2=8A=A3 [id, G]=
, which I
called pointwise adjunctions, perhaps due to some connection I thought
they had with pointwise Kan extensions (but which I can no longer
recall).
Which one would be pre-whiskering and which one would be post-whiskering?

Thanks,
Jason
