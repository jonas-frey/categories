Hi, everyone.

Below you will find the CFP for Graphical Models in Security of which I am
one of the cochairs this year.

I would like to bring your attention to this years expanded scope.  In
particular, to the following entries:

1. Graph representations: mathematical, conceptual, and implemented
tools for describing and reasoning about security and safety
2. Logical approaches: formal logical tools for representing and
reasoning about graphs and their use as modelling tools in security
7. Semantics: developing or studying semantic approaches to graph-based
models used in security like set theoretic models, categorical models,
logical models, etc.

These entries have a large non-empty intersection with topics related to
the category theory community.

So submissions from this community will be well-received.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Very best,
Harley

GraMSec 2020: The Seventh International Workshop on Graphical Models for
Security
Boston, MA, United States of America - June 22, 2020

http://gramsec.uni.lu
Co-located with CSF 2020

SCOPE

The use of graphical security models to represent and analyse the
security of systems has gained an increasing research attention over the
last two decades. Formal methods and computer security researchers, as
well as security professionals from the industry and government, have
proposed various graphical security models, metrics, and measurements.
Graphical models are used to capture different security facets and
address a range of challenges including security assessment, automated
defence, secure services composition, security policy validation, and
verification. The International Workshop on Graphical Models for Security
is an established scientific event dedicated to study and exchange
of experiences on graphical security and safety modelling.


TOPICS

This year, we encourage excellent submissions related, but not
restricted, to the following broad headings:
1. Graph representations: mathematical, conceptual, and implemented
tools for describing and reasoning about security and safety
2. Logical approaches: formal logical tools for representing and
reasoning about graphs and their use as modelling tools in security
3. Machine learning: modelling and reasoning about the role of big data
and machine learning in security operations
4. Networks in national security: terrorist networks, counter-terrorism
networks; safety in national infrastructure (e.g., utilities and
transportation)
5. Risk analysis and management: models and graphical methodologies for
security and privacy risk management in business and organisational
architectures
6. Social networks: using and reasoning about social graphs, network
analysis, network protocols, social mapping, sociometry.
7. Semantics: developing or studying semantic approaches to graph-based
models used in security like set theoretic models, categorical models,
logical models, etc.
8. Threat modelling: modelling and analysing software systems security,
models for DevSecOps, etc.
9. Security requirements: models and tools for describing and analysing
requirements on system security and privacy.
10. Visual security: modelling and analytics for security visualisations.
11. Secure systems: safe and secure system design, quantification of
security/safety, models for system security/safety evaluation.

We welcome a broad range of contributions: from theory to tools and
experience reports. Preference will be given to papers likely to
stimulate high-quality debate at the Workshop.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We solicit two types of submissions:
- Regular papers (up to 18 pages, excluding the bibliography and
well-marked appendices) describing original and unpublished work within
the scope of the workshop.
- Short papers (up to 10 pages, excluding the bibliography and
well-marked appendices) describing original and unpublished work in
progress.

The reviewers are not required to read the appendices, so the papers
should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be prepared
using the LNCS style. Each paper will undergo a thorough review process.
Submissions should be made using the GraMSec 2020 EasyChair website:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dgramsec2020.

PUBLICATION

As in previous editions, we plan for the post-proceedings to be made
available in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series,
published by Springer (acceptance pending). This will be published
after the workshop, thus permitting the authors to incorporate
feedback.

IMPORTANT DATES

We will have two rounds of submissions with different submission and
notification deadlines.

First round submissions (priority in program and notifications):
- Submissions due: Friday, April 1, 2020
- Notifications: Friday, May 1, 2020

Second round submissions (after CSF notification):
- Submissions due: Friday, April 24, 2020
- Notifications: May 18, 2020

- Workshop: Monday, June 22, 2020
- Camera ready versions due: Friday, August 7, 2020
