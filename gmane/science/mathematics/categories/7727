Thomas,

Peter is correct about my intention. More precisely, 'separable' is defined in
Formal Spaces (FS) (Fourman & Grayson, Brouwer Centenary Symposium) 3.12(c)
--- although I now find this account unnecessarily obscure.

What you say below is correct classically; constructively there is some subtlety.

A locale is separable iff it is presented (as in FS 1.1) by a countable language
with decidable \leq and countably many *inhabited* basic covers.
