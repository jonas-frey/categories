Dear Olivia,



Could you perhaps explain why you say that the notion of S-bounded
elementary topos is "certainly less controversial" than the Grothendieckian
notion of category of sheaves on a site? As you know, by a theorem of
Diaconescu, the two points of view are equivalent: an elementary topos is
S-bounded if and only if it is equivalent to the category of S-valued
sheaves on an internal site in S. In light of this result, I find it very
natural to refer to bounded S-toposes as "Grothendieck toposes over S", and
I have noticed that this use is quite widespread in the literature.



Of course agree with you that S-bounded topos and S-valued sheaves on a sit=
e in S, for S an elementary topos, are equivalent notions by a theorem of D=
iaconescu. By "certainly less controversial" I was referring to a previous =
posting of mine in response to Steve Vickers, in which by a Grothendieck to=
pos I had meant therein a category of Set-valued sheaves on a site in Set r=
ather than on an arbitrary (elementary) topos S.




I agree with Andr=E9 that it is important to clearly distinguish the concep=
t
of Grothendieck topos from that of elementary topos also terminologically,
since the presence of sites of definition is a distinctive feature which wa=
s
central in Grothendieck's view and usage of toposes. Sites (or other kinds
of presentations for bounded toposes) are essential for studying 'concrete'
mathematical problems (not just in algebraic geometry or topology but in
virtually any branch of mathematics) from a topos-theoretic point of view.
Whilst general results about bounded toposes should be preferably proved
without referring to their presentations and even at the elementary topos
level whenever possible, the essential ambiguity given by the fact that a
Grothendieck topos admits in general an infinite number of different sites
of definition can be exploited to generate a great number of interesting
notions and results arising from the 'calculation' of topos-theoretic
invariants in terms of these different presentations.


Once again, there seems to be a misunderstanding, as I too have pointed out=
  the distinction between the notion of a Grothendieck topos (as, say, S-val=
ued sheaves on a site in S, for S an elementary topos) and that of an eleme=
ntary topos, such as S. What I was arguing against was the need to change t=
he terminology in such a way that by "topos" one meant "sheaves on a site" =
and that  "elementary topos" ought to be relabelled "logical topos" conside=
ring, according to Joyal, that "the natural notion of morphism between elem=
entary toposes is that of a logical morphism", suggesting by it that the no=
tion of an elementary topos came from (or is suitable to) logic and  not fr=
om (or suitable to) geometry. Now, this is simply not the case. The very fa=
ct that such categories were called "(elementary) toposes" already suggests=
  otherwise. Moreover, the discovery (by Lawvere) that all of higher-order l=
ogic could be interpreted in an elementary topos came afterwards, and so it=
  turned out that both geometry and logic were present in it. The only way t=
o distinguish them is therefore by means of the morphisms adopted in each c=
ase - that is, either geometric or logical morphisms.



Best wishes,

Marta
