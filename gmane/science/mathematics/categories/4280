Bill is quite right on what the author's say. I'd also be glad of any of
Bill's comments on the `Historical remarks on the development of smooth
calculus', pp, 79-83, which seem very carefully put.

It might interest people to give what seems the origin of the word
`convenient category'. In my 1963 paper `Ten topologies for X x Y' (a title
frivolously influenced by `Seven brides for seven brothers') I wrote in the
Introduction:

`It may be that the category of Hausdorff k-spaces is adequate and
convenient for all purposes of topology'.

`Convenient' here meant cartesian closed. One of the above ten topologies
gives monoidal closed on all Hausdorff spaces. Some later writers removed
the Hausdorff restrictions (I tried, but I was at that time not too good on
final topologies). The current acount in `Topology and Groupoids' was
influenced by Eldon Dyer.

But for analysis the Kriegl-Michor comments show how the emphasis moved from
k-spaces to ideas from Frohlicher, Bill and others.

Ronnie points out the very excellent 1997
book on smooth analysis by Kriegl & Michor.
 In fact, not the reviewer but the authors themselves
originally stated the principle of

functional analysis "rather than" category theory.

It is rather strange since much of the
material in the book was arrived at
by very categorical means. For example,
results published in Kriegl's joint work
with Alfred Frolicher are basic. My dismay
is reflected in my RCMP paper on Volterra,
where I praise the book for its powerful
combination of

functional analysis "and" category theory.

In  a related expositional choice the book
claims to be about topological vector spaces,
 but the definition of morphism used betrays the fact
that the weaker structures of bounded
sequences and of C-infinity paths are the
actual underpinning.

It would be instructive to know whether this
strategy actually widened the audience in the
past 10 years.
