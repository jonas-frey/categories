                        FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS
       International Workshop on Hybrid Logic 2006 (HyLo 2006)
                       Affiliated with LICS 2006
                    August 11, 2006, Seattle, USA
*******************************************************************

AIMS AND SCOPE:

Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic in which it is possible to
directly refer to worlds/times/states or whatever the elements of
the (Kripke) model are meant to represent. Although they date back
to the late 1960s, and have been sporadically investigated ever
since, it is only in the 1990s that work on them really got into
its stride.

It is easy to justify interest in hybrid logic on applied grounds,
because of the usefulness of the additional expressive power.
For example, when reasoning about time one often wants to build
up a series of assertions about what happens at a particular
instant,and standard modal formalisms do not allow this. What is
less obvious is that the route hybrid logic takes to overcome
this problem (the basic mechanism being to add nominals ---
atomic symbols true at a unique point --- together with extra
modalities to exploit them) often actually improves the behavior
of the underlying modal formalism. For example, it becomes far
simpler to formulate modal tableau, resolution, and natural
deduction in hybrid logic, and completeness and interpolation
results can be proved of a generality that is not available in
orthodox modal logic.

Hybrid logic is now a mature field, therefore a theme of special
interest at this HyLo workshop will be the combination of hybrid
logic with other logics, the basic methodological question being
"what is the best way of hybridizing a given logic?" However,
submissions in all areas of hybrid logic are welcome.

The workshop HyLo 2006 is likely to be relevant to a wide range of
people, including those interested in description logic, feature
logic, applied modal logics, temporal logic, and labelled
deduction. The workshop continues a series of previous workshops
on hybrid logic, for example the LICS-affiliated HyLo 2002
(http://floc02.diku.dk/HYLO) which was held as part of FLoC 2002,
Copenhagen, Denmark. If you are unsure whether your work is of
relevance to the workshop, please do not hesitate to contact the
workshop organizers for more information. Contact details are
given below.

For more general background on hybrid logic, and many of the key
papers, see the Hybrid Logics homepage (http://hylo.loria.fr/).

INVITED SPEAKERS:

Patrick Blackburn (INRIA Lorraine, France)
Title: Hybrid Logic and Temporal Semantics

Valeria de Paiva (PARC, USA)
Title: Constructive Hybrid Logics and Contexts

Ian Horrocks (University of Manchester, UK)
Title: Hybrid Logics and Ontology Languages

PROGRAM COMMITTEE:

Carlos Areces (INRIA Lorraine, France)
Patrick Blackburn (INRIA Lorraine, France)
Thomas Bolander (Technical University of Denmark)
Torben Bra=FCner (Roskilde University, Denmark) --- Chair
Valeria de Paiva (PARC, USA)
Melvin Fitting (Lehman College, New York, USA)
Balder ten Cate (University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
J=F8rgen Villadsen (Roskilde University, Denmark)

SUBMISSIONS:

We invite the contribution of papers reporting new work from
researchers interested in hybrid logic. The revised version of
accepted papers will be published online in an Elsevier
ENTCS (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/entcs/) volume devoted to
FLoC 2006 satellite workshops. A preliminary version of the
proceedings will also be distributed at the workshop. One author
for each accepted paper must attend the workshop in order to
present the paper.

Please use the HyLo 2006 submission page
(http://www.easychair.org/HyLo2006/), handled by the EasyChair
conference system, to submit papers. Papers should not exceed
15 pages including references. Authors are strongly encouraged
to prepare their submissions according to the ENTCS guidelines
(http://www.entcs.org/).

IMPORTANT DATES:

Deadline for submissions: June 1, 2006 (strict)
Notification of acceptance: June 20, 2006
Deadline for final versions: July 21, 2006
