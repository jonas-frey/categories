Dear Vaughan,

I too thought about torsors, but couldn't see round the problem that
they fix a unit length. (Suppose E is an inner product space and X a
torsor for it, then for any x, y in X there is a unique v in E taking x
to y, and so the length of v gives the distance from x to y.) Does
"liberalizing the morphisms" in the way you suggest really do the trick?
That seems to require a new notion of torsor, and I can't see how it
would work technically.

Regards,

Steve.
