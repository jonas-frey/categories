Eduardo,=20

We (Thomas andI) are not answering a different question - at least I was not=
. Maybe the notation used by Thomas made you think so. Still it is the case t=
hat you start with a bounded S-topos EE-->SS (unnamed)) and then consider a p=
oint SS --->EE over SS, whose inverse image you denote by F:EE -->SS. I unde=
rstood that. Now there are the following considerations.=20


(a) =46rom EE bounded over SS you get a site CC (with a topology j, say) whi=
ch is internal to SS. This gives you, for an object X of EE, the epimorphism=
  from the appropriate coproduct in EE to X. The remarks Thomas made (at leas=
t some of them) correspond to this basic construction you definitely use. I t=
otally agree with that. You need an object G of generators and the epi in qu=
estion expressed by the diagram Thomas included in his answer, and which you=
  can also see in page 51-52 of my book with Jonathon  Singular Coverings of T=
oposes, SLNM 1890, 2006.=20



(b) Now you resort to F:EE ---> SS which is left exact and has an SS-indexed=
  right adjoint. This is why you may infer that F preserves the given diagram=
  of an epi into X from a coproduct involving CC, which is again an epi from a=
  coproduct (with the same indexing "set"!) to FX. Cannot draw these diagrams=
  in an iPad, at least not easily. Here you argue "as in Set", but the part t=
hat needs the interplay between EE and SS us the first one and you cannot av=
oid that.=20

Without Joyal-Tierney's Memoir at hand I cannot comment on your assertion ab=
out it except by recollection. I will do so in Montreal next week.=20

As for Diaconescu's theorem, it too requires the notion of an internal objec=
t of generators, which is one of of his main contributions in lifting a noti=
on well understood for Grothendieck toposes over Set to "Grothendieck topose=
s" over an arbitrary base topos SS. Another is of course to express the corr=
ect lifting of "flatness".=20

I am aware that there are attempts to describe a logic that extends the inte=
rnal logic of a topos SS but in which all of this can be expressed including=
  fibrations over SS and, in the process, getting rid of all the neat constru=
ctions involving category theory. In my view, the goal of reducing topos the=
ory to a certain "naive constructive set theory", even if succesful, will no=
t aid in the formulation of new concepts or their use. As a matter of pride,=
  logicians may be able to say "we did it",  but category theorists in genera=
l and topos theorists in particular will not be attracted by it. Hopefully, t=
hat is. Finally, everyone knows that the internal logic of a topos is intuit=
itionistic  But who exhibited the object \Omega which permits such a conclus=
ion? Grothendieck calls \Omega "the Lawvere object".=20

Please revise carefully your construction and argument, and then tell me if I=
  am not right. I close shop now until further notice.
