Dear all,

Charles Ehresmann was somewhat reticent about Bourbaki's theory of =20
structures. In fact, he only participated to the first discussions on =20
the "Fascicule de r=E9sultats" since he progressively took its distances =20
with the group in the late forties. One of the reasons he gave me for =20
this withdrawal (among others) was that he thought that a good theory =20
of structures should include a theory of "local structures" which has =20
motivated a large part of his earlier works.

In several papers in the early fifties, in particular in his 1952 Rio =20
de Janeiro course (reprinted in "Charles Ehresmann : Oeuvres completes =20
et comment=E9es" Part II-1) he briefly recalls the Bourbaki's =20
definition, and then proceeds to develop his own theory of local =20
structures. At this time, he did not know the notion of a category, =20
the interest of which he discovered later through one of his students. =20
It means that categories were not much discussed in France at that =20
time...

The first paper where Charles uses categories is the seminal paper =20
"Gattungen von lokalen Strukturen", 1957 (reprinted in the same volume =20
II-1 of the "Oeuvres"). The aim of the paper is to define a general =20
notion of a species of structures and of a species of local structures.
For that, he introduces the action of a category C on a set S, calling =20
S a species of structures over C; he proves that it corresponds to a =20
functor F from C^op to Set, and defines the associated discrete =20
fibration, which he calls a "hypermorphism category".
Then he defines a species of local structures by internalizing this in =20
the category of local sets (well before internal categories were =20
known=85) and gives a "Complete Enlargement Theorem" which translates in =20
this categorical setting the construction of the species of local =20
structures associated to a pseudogroup of transformations.
Though the definitions are for general categories, in the last parts =20
he restricts the categories to groupoids. (This 1957 paper has been at =20
the basis of a large part of his/our later works on internal =20
categories, sketches, completion theorems,=85)

However at that time he said to me that he was not satisfied with the =20
notion of structures, and it led him to develop a more categorical =20
frame while we were in Buenos-Aires in 1958, introducing the notion of =20
   "type functors" (in the paper "Cat=E9gories des foncteurs types" 1960, =20
reprinted in Volume IV-1 of the "Oeuvres" where is also given the =20
first definition of a double category).

His interest of the notion of a species of structures and of =20
"covariant maps" between them has motivated the title of his 1965 book =20
"Categories et Structures" (Dunod).

Yours
Andree
