Dear Michael,

The asymmetry you are mentioning is very different.

One of your old theorems, expressed in a language recently used by Maria
Manuel Clementino, Dirk Hofmann, Walter Tholen and others, says that the
category of topological spaces can be identified with the category of
(T,V)-categories (=lax (T,V)-algebras) for V = 2 = {0,1} considered as a
symmetric monoidal category, and T being the ultrafilter monad on the
category of sets.

If T is the identity monad on the category of sets, a (T,V)-category becomes
just a V-category (=a category enriched in V), and - at least when V is a
quantale - it makes sense to call a V-category X "symmetric" if X(a,b) =
X(b,a) for all objects a and b in X (where X(a,b) denotes the internal hom
object).

Example 1 (the old observation of Bill Lawvere - as you know of course):
When V = R+ (suitable monoidal category of nonnegative real numbers), a
V-category is exactly an asymmetric metric space, while a symmetric
V-category is an ordinary metric space (well, ignoring the axiom d(x,y) = 0
=> x = y of course).

Example 2 (obvious): When V = 2, a V-category is a preorder (=reflexive and
transitive binary relation on a set), while a symmetric V-category is an
equivalence relation (=symmetric preorder).

But when T is not an identity monad as in your old theorem, the symmetry
does not even make sense - simply because, say, a relation between T(X) and
X cannot be symmetric. That is, the ordinary topological spaces are already
"much more asymmetric" than asymmetric metric spaces!

And what I said about (asymmetric) metric spaces can be repeated for
(quasi)uniform spaces with "pro" involved: see [M. M. Clementino, D.
Hofmann, W. Tholen, One setting for all: Metric, Topology, Uniformity,
Approach Structure, Applied Categorical Structures 12, 2004, 127-154]. So
again, "the ordinary topological spaces are much more asymmetric than
asymmetric uniform spaces (=quasiuniform spaces)".

But yes, quasiuniform spaces have been and are studied seriously -
particularly categorically and particularly by Guillaume Brummer and
Hans-Peter Kunzi in Cape Town.

George

One obvious thing that comes to mind are asymmetric spaces--a metric
without the symmetry axiom.  This can obviously be extended to uniform
spaces, although I am not aware anyone has.  As for topological spaces, I
know of nothing there.
