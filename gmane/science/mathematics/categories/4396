                             Workshop   DOMAINS IX

         http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/events/domains9/

         University of Sussex, Brighton, 22-24 September 2008

INTRODUCTION

    The Workshop on Domains is aimed at computer scientists and
     mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
     foundations of computation. The workshop will focus on
     domains, their applications and related topics.  Previous
meetings were
     held in Darmstadt (94,99,04), Braunschweig (96), Munich (97),
     Siegen (98), Birmingham (02) and Novosibirsk (07).

FORMAT

    The emphasis is on the exchange of ideas between participants
similar
     in style to Dagstuhl seminars.  In particular, talks on subjects
     presented at other conferences and workshops are acceptable.

INVITED SPEAKERS (confirmed)

    Andrew Pitts 			Cambridge University
    John Longley			University of Edinburgh
    Martin Hyland		        Cambridge University
    Jean Goubault-Larrecq   LSV/ENS Cachan & CNRS

   More speakers to be announced nearer to the time.

SCOPE

     Domain theory has had applications to programming language
     semantics and logics (lambda-calculus, PCF, LCF), recursion theory
     (Kleene-Kreisel countable functionals), general topology
     (injective spaces, function spaces, locally compact spaces, Stone
     duality), topological algebra (compact Hausdorff semilattices) and
     analysis (measure, integration, dynamical systems). Moreover,
     these applications are related - for example, Stone duality gives
     rise to a logic of observable properties of computational
     processes.

     As such, domain theory is highly interdisciplinary. Topics of
     interaction with domain theory for this workshop include, but are
     not limited to:

       program semantics
       program logics
       probabilistic computation
       exact computation over the real numbers
       lambda calculus
       games
       models of sequential computation
       constructive mathematics
       recursion theory
       realizability
       real analysis and computability
       topology, metric spaces and domains
       locale theory
       category theory
       topos theory
       type theory


SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS

     _*One-page* abstracts should be submitted now to

                   domains9@sussex.ac.uk

     Shortly after an abstract is submitted (usually one or two weeks),
     the authors will be notified by the programme committee. The
     criterion for acceptance is relevance to the meeting. In
     particular, talks on subjects presented at other conferences and
     workshops are acceptable.

     *** Abstracts will be dealt with on a first-come/first-served
basis! ***
     *** So please submit soon to avoid disappointment.     ***

DEADLINE

     1 July 2008

REGISTRATION

    Further details about the local arrangements will be provided soon.

    PhD students or participants from Eastern Europe who think they need
    financial support to be able to attend should contact the PC.
Depending
    on the funding, subsistence costs might be (partially) covered
for those
    participants.

ACCOMMODATION

   The workshop will be held at the University of Sussex at Falmer,
Brighton.
   Newly built halls of residence will be available to workshop
participants.
   Further information on travel, accommodation and places of local
interest
   will be provided at a later date.

PROGRAMME COMMITTEE

     Martin Escardo    			University of Birmingham
     Achim Jung   (Co-Chair)		University of Birmingham
     Klaus Keimel (Co-Chair)	Darmstadt University
     Bernhard Reus (Co-Chair)    University of Sussex
     Thomas Streicher 			Darmstadt University

ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE

     Bernhard Reus    			University of Sussex

PUBLICATION

     We plan to publish proceedings of the workshop in a journal.
     There will be a call for papers after the workshop.
     The papers will be refereed according to normal publication
standards.
