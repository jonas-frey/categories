A few weeks ago there has been a discussion about stability by =
composition of fibrations, bifibrations, and similar notions. Obviously =
the results depend on how such notions are defined.  I would like to =
make a few comments, in particular about Steve Vickers' mail, since all =
the other participants to the discussion seemed to accept his approach.

(I )    VICKERS' DEFINITION OF FIBRATION
if C is a 2-category with comma objects and 2-pullbacks, a one cell p: B =
-> A is a fibration iff it satisfies the Chevalley condition.

Let us test this definition in special cases.
If  S is a category with finite limits the 2-category Cat(S) of internal =
categories in S satisfies Vickers' conditions hence we know when an =
internal functor is a fibration.=20
Let Set be the category of sets, except WE DON'T ASSUME THE AXIOM OF =
CHOICE (AC). Then Cat(Set), abbreviated by Cat, is the 2-Category of =
small categories.
An easy verification shows that a functor p: B -> A  satisfies the =
Chevalley condition iff it is a fibration which admits a cleavage. Thus =
Vickers' argument, in that case, gives as result: fibrations WHICH ADMIT =
A CLEAVAGE are stable by composition.=20
On the other hand, it is easy to show that: Every small fibration has a =
cleavage is equivalent to AC. This well known fact can be very much =
strengthened by the following example:

If AC does not hold in Set, one can construct in Cat a bifibration  p: B =
-> A  with internal products and coproducts where A and B are =
pre-ordered sets, with pullbacks preserved by p, every map of B is both =
cartesian and cocartesian, and add each of the following conditions:
(i)  p has neither a cleavage nor a cocleavage.=20
(ii) A bit surprisingly:   p is a split fibration but has no cocleavage.
(iii) Dual of (ii):   p is a cosplit cofibration but has no cleavage.

And of course we don't need AC to show that arbitrary fibrations in Cat =
are stable by composition.

(II)     2-CTEGORICAL FIBRATIONS
Other definitions of fibrations in an arbitrary 2-Category C have been =
proposed. The principal one, based on Yoneda, is:  A one cell  p: B -> A =
of  C  is a fibration iff for every object X of C the obvious functor  =
C(X,B) -> C(X,A) is a fibration in Cat, functorial in X.=20
If C has comma objects and 2-pullbacks, it is easy to see that this is =
equivalent to Vickers' notion, and we have already seen how it can be =
inadequate.
Of course, I don't refer here to Sreet's notion which describes a =
totally different kind of fibration, stable by equivalences.

(III)    BIFIBRATIONS
For bifibrations the situation is even more confusing: Ghani defines =
them, in Cat, by the existence of left adjoints to the reindexing =
functors, Except that without AC reindexing functors need not exist. =
Vickers uses two duals of the 2-category C where the fibration lives. =
However if C has comma objects and 2-pullbacks, there is no reason why =
these duals have the same properties. Moreover, even in Cat, Vickers' =
approach will work only for bifibrations which have both a cleavage and =
a co-cleavage.=20
Thus the wide generalization asserted by Vickers imposes in the well =
known situations drastic and unnecessary restrictions. (Compare with the =
example at the end of (I))


(IV)    INTERNAL FIBRATIONS.=20
For a long time I have insisted on the fact that the the theory of =
fibrations is first order and can be internalized. In particular in =
Cat(S) where S is a topos.=20
Let me give a very simple example. Suppose A and B are groups of S and  =
p: B -> A  is a group morphism. Then p is an internal fibration iff it =
is an epi of S. It satisfies the Chevalley condition iff p admits a =
splitting in S..=20
Without any such splitting, internally, every element of B is an iso, =
hence it is both cartesian and co-cartesian. Thus p is a bifibration. =
Moreover, again internally, since A and B are groups, every commutative  =
square of B, or A, is a pullback, thus B and A have pullbacks preserved =
by p, and in B the pullback of a cocartesian map along a cartesian map =
exists and is cocartesian. Hence p is a fibration with internal sums, it =
has also trivially internal products.=20
But it has neither cleavages, cocleavages, nor reindexings.=20
What would the theory of groups, torsors, classifiers etc. in a topos S  =
look like if we were forced to assume that S satisfies AC ?

Let me add that the internalization works not only for fibrations, but =
also for prefibrations and even for the (pre)foliations which I have =
defined and studied.

(V)    THE GROTHENDIECK CONSTRUCTION AND INDEXED CATEGORIES.
Suppose S is a topos. If S satisfies AC, every fibration in Cat(S) will =
have a cleavage.=20
However, even if S =3D Set , the Grothendieck construction doesn't make =
sense without further assumptions, because:  if A is an internal =
category the very notion of a pseudo functor from A(op) to Cat(S) does =
not make sense since A is internal and Cat(S) is not an internal =
2-category (a notion which can be easily defined)

One of the mottos of the Elephant is that fibrations and indexed =
categories are essentially equivalent, but the second notion doesn't =
even make sense. it is defined as a pseudo functor from a category, =
which is a mathematical object, into the meta 2-category Cat. Moreover, =
to get the 2-category of indexed categories, we are required to collect =
ALL such pseudo functors and their transformations. Thus I ask the =
question: What is such a collection, a meta-meta 2-category?

Yet another example:  If we use Lawvere's Category of categories as a =
foundation for mathematics, fibrations, or cloven fibrations, make =
perfect sense, but indexed categories don't, let alone the equivalence =
between the two notions.

In the introduction of the Elephant one can read, I quote:
We should make the smallest possible demands on the metatheory within =
which we interpret the theory of categories (and in particular we shall =
not assume that it satisfies any form of the axiom of choice ...
After reading carefully the chapter on indexed categories and =
fibrations, I ask Peter Johnstone if the following assertion would not =
be be more appropriate:
We shall make, in particular in Chapter B1, the greatest possible =
demands on the metatheory and in particular assume that it satisfies the =
strongest form of the axiom of choice..

Incidentally, that is exactly what Grothendieck does: He uses the axiom =
of universes, and the tau symbol which is the strongest possible form of =
AC.
But, even under such strong assumptions, I think he would object (and so =
would many other persons), if only for aesthetic reasons, to the =
following sentence which can be found many times in the Elephant:
Let  p be a fibration and  C be THE associated indexed category, ...
And this of course, according to Johnstone, without ANY form of AC.=20

I'd have many more comments but this mail is already a bit long. I =
apologize for this length, and also for using capital letters in many =
places where italics or quotation marks would have been more =
appropriate. But ... HTML oblige.=20
