Even a perfunctory analysis should indicate that the attendees would be

That's easy: just have them visualize a function as a list of its values
at the points in its domain enumerated in some fixed order.  Programmers
can easily see how many lists of length n there are for any given size
of codomain of the function (e.g. lists of bits as functions to {0,1}).
  The empty list should hold no terrors for programmers: in particular
they should know it exists, and they should know why there aren't two
empty lists.
