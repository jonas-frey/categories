This is one of those "does such-and-such have a name" and "where can I
read about it" emails.

I'm interested in a particular map F : A -> B between strict 2-categories.
The codomain is something like Cat and the domain has exactly two objects,
say 0 and 1. If we restrict to the sub 2-category at 0, then F is a lax
functor with 2-cells for both composition and the identity; if we restrict
to 1, then F is oplax. In general, there is a 2-cell in the usual square
whose boundary encodes functoriality with respect to composition of
1-cells and that 2-cell points in the lax direction if the composition
occurs at 0 and the oplax direction if it occurs at 1.

Up to this contradicting directionality, everything is "maximally
coherent". For example, the usual pasting diagram for associativity of,
say, a pseudofunctor is a diagram of 2-cells that sit inside two
rectangles whose domain object is

A(c,d) x A(b,c) x A(a,b)

and whose codomain is

B(Fa,Fd).

If b=c then the 2-cells point in compatible directions and the pasted
composites agree. If b and c differ, the 2-cells aren't composable
directly but if we formally inverted one set then the diagram would
commute.

Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Emily Riehl
