Hi Paul

=20

I still think you are getting me wrong=2C as did Ronnie. But never mind=2C =
i am used to it

since i don't follow the mainstream science ways to specialize=2C solve pro=
blems=2C publish=2C repeat.
Yet the problems interest will pass very soon. I now know 19 ordinary categ=
ory problems (if you explain

this one) vs. at least 23 in higher category theory. This explains why i re=
stricted to ordinary categories.=20

=20

>From the good side i should be thankful that you and Ronnie trie to direct =
me towards "true mathematics"=2C

but i have already found my "true mathematics". A big part of the process t=
o get there was precisely to

ask own quastions and finding the answers to them. But some people just got=
 irritated when i asked them

questions (in their field!) they didn't have the answer to.

=20

I don't follow to the end here.
Why should presheaves be illegitimate?
Then=2C i suppose the axiom of collection is valid at least in the CCC.
But what is so bad about the axiom of collection in this case?

Do the embedding get bad?
