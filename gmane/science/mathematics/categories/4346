---------------------------------------

This ICALP 2008 affiliated joint event combines two (established) workshop
series:

QUANTUM PHYSICS AND LOGIC (QPL'08): This event has as its goal to bring
together researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum
computing and the use of logical tools, new structures, formal languages,
semantical  methods and other computer science methods for the study
quantum behaviour in general.  Over the past couple of years there has
been a growing activity in these foundational approaches together with a
renewed interest in the foundations of quantum theory, which complement
the more mainstream research in quantum  computation.  A predecessor of
this event, with the same acronym, called Quantum Programming Languages,
was held in  Ottawa (2003),  Turku (2004),  Chicago (2005) and Oxford
(2006); with the change of name and a new program committee we wish to
emphasise the intended much broader scope of this event, aiming to nourish
interaction between modern computer science logic, quantum computation and
information, and structural foundations for quantum physics.

DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPUTATIONAL MODELS (DCM'08):  Besides quantum computing,
several  new  models  of computation have emerged in the last few years,
and many developments of traditional computational models have been
proposed with the aim of taking into account the new demands of computer
systems users and the new capabilities of computation engines. A new
computational model, or a new feature in a traditional one, usually is
reflected in new structural paradigms.  The aim of this workshop is to
bring together researchers who are currently developing new computational
models or new features for traditional computational models, in order to
foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and
work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current
activities in this area.  Previous editions in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were
also affiliated to ICALP.

Dates:

- Submission deadline: March 31
- Acceptance/rejection notification: April 21
- Pre-proceedings versions due: June 15
- Workshop: July 12-13 2007

Submission format:

Prospective speakers are invited to submit a 2-5 pages abstract which
provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest and provides
sufficient detail to allows the program  committee to assess the merits of
the work.  Submissions of works in progress are encouraged but must be
more substantial than a research proposal.  We both encourage submissions
of original research as well as research submitted elsewhere.  Authors of
accepted original research contributions will be invited to submit a full
paper to a special issue of a journal yet to be decided on.  Submissions
should be in Postscript or PDF format and should be sent to Bob Coecke
<coecke@comlab.ox.ac.uk> by  March 31.  Receipt of all submissions will be
acknowledged by return email. Accepted contributors will be able to
publish extended versions of their abstracts in Electronic Notes in
Theoretical Computer Science.

The workshop enjoys support from:
EPSRC Network Semantics of Quantum Computation (EP/E006833/1)
EPSRC ARF The Structure of Quantum Information and its Applications to IT (EP/D072786/1)
