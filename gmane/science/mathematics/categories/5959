> One would suppose that the notions of literary topos and humility =
topos were of ancient origin.  Certainly "topos" appears in Aristotle's =
Rhetoric in the original Greek.  However its entry into the academic =
lexicon as an English word relevant to rhetoric and other literary forms =
would seem, as far as I've been able to tell, to have occurred at some =
point in the 20th century.

The online OED confirms this; it does contain "topos", defining it as=20
> "A traditional motif or theme (in a literary composition); a =
rhetorical commonplace, a literary convention or formula."
and the earliest citation it gives is 1948, in Leo Spitzer's =
"Linguistics and literary history" (presumably referring to Curtius's =
work).

Interestingly, though, its earliest cited uses of "topic" (16th/17th =
century) are also as a translation of Aristotle's "topos", and with a =
similar meaning to Curtius's "topos".

> 1.  Volume Ti-Tz of the OED does not contain the word "topos," nor =
does it appear under the entries for "humility" or "literary."  =
(Ordinarily the OED can relied on to record just about every English =
word that has appeared in print prior to the 20th century.)

> 2.  Adams Sherman Hill, Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory in =
Harvard University from 1876 to 1904, wrote "The Foundations of =
Rhetoric" in 1892 with no mention of the concept of topos as a notion in =
rhetoric.

Lateinisches Mittelalter. It was a major study of the Medieval Latin =
literature and its effect on subsequent writing in modern European =
