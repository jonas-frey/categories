Jean Benabou has formulated four problems of category theory.
They were communicated to a restricted list of peoples, not a private =
list.
I see no serious raisons for not sharing these problems with everyones.=20
Here they are:


>Prob1. What conditions must a (small)  category C satisfy in order that =
:
>there exists a faithful functor  F: C --> G  where  G  is a groupoid?   =
=20
>(Generalized "Mal'cev" conditions)

>Prob2.  A "little" bit harder, in the same vein. Let C  be a (small) =
category,=20
> S a set of maps of C and P: C --> C[Inv(S)]  be the universal functor=20
> which inverts all maps of S. What conditions must the pair  (C,S)  =
satisfy=20
>so that the functor >P  is faithful?

> If  P: C --> S  is a functor, I denote by V(P)  the subcategory of C =20
>which has the same objects and as maps the vertical maps i.e. the f's =
such=20
>that P(f) is an identity. Let V  be a subcategory of a (small) category =
C.=20
> What conditions >must  the pair (C,V)  satisfy in order that:

>Prob3. There exists a functor P with domain C such that  V =3D V(P)
>Prob4. There exists a fibration  P with domain  C  such that  V =3D =
V(P)
