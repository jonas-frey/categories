[Please forward as appropriate.]

The Math Department at Western will be hiring one or more postdocs to
start in summer 2018.  The application deadline is January 4, 2018.
The full ad is available at

   https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/UWO/PDF

and I have included the text of it below.

The Math Department has several faculty working in topology, category
theory, homotopy type theory and related areas, including Jardine,
Kapulkin and me.  Applicants in these and other areas represented in
the department are particularly encouraged to apply.

Our department has an active postdoctoral program and a busy seminar
schedule with many visitors.  More information about the department
and the School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences are available
at http://uwo.ca/math/ and http://uwo.ca/smss/

The positions have a reduced teaching load of just two half-courses.
A "half-course" is a 13-week course meeting for 3 or 4 hours each week.
Note also that the cost of living in London is quite low.

Feel free to contact me with questions, or to use the e-mail address
below.
