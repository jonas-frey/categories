Hi,

Sam Lindley and Ian Stark proved that Moggi's computational
Metalanguage (\lambda_ML) is decidable - this is simply typed lambda
calculus with a monad. If I am not mistaken your theory can be
faithfully encoded in \lambda_ML.

Actually, isn't it the case that the continuation monad is actually
the free monad. Hence, using this result decidability of \lambda_ML
should follow from the decidability of simply typed lambda calculus.

Cheers,
Thorsten
