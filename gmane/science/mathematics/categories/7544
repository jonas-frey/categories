TOPOLOGY, ALGEBRA AND CATEGORIES IN LOGIC (TACL 2013)

======================================================

July 28 - August 1, 2013
Department of Mathematics, Vanderbilt University
Nashville, Tennessee USA
http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~tacl2013/

The Sixth International Conference on Topology, Algebra and Categories
in conjunction with the
28th Annual Shanks Lecture Series

======================================================

Confirmed invited speakers
-------------------------------------

Vladimir Voevodsky, Institute for Advanced Studies, USA (Shanks Lecturer)

Nick Bezhanishvili, Utrecht University, The Netherlands

Leo Cabrer, University of Oxford, UK

Silvio Ghilardi, University of Milan, Italy

George Metcalfe, University of Bern, Switzerland

Alex Simpson, University of Edinburgh, UK



Scope
---------

Studying logics via semantics is a well-established and very active
branch of mathematical logic, with many applications, in computer
science and elsewhere. The area is characterized by results, tools and
techniques stemming from various fields, including universal algebra,
topology, category theory, order, and model theory. The program of the
conference TACL 2013 will focus on three interconnecting mathematical
themes central to the semantical study of logics and their
applications: algebraic, categorical, and topological methods. This is
the sixth conference in the series Topology, Algebra and Categories in
Logic (TACL, formerly TANCL).  Earlier installments of this conference
have been organized in Tbilisi (2003), Barcelona (2005), Oxford
(2007), Amsterdam (2009), Marseilles (2011).



Featured topics
---------------------

Contributed talks can deal with any topic dealing with the use of
algebraic, categorical or topological methods in either logic or
computer science. This includes, but is not limited to, the following
areas:


* Algebraic structures in CS

* Algebraic logic

* Coalgebra

* Categorical methods in logic

* Domain theory

* Lattice theory

* Lattices with operators

* Many-valued and fuzzy logics

* Modal logics

* Non-classical logics

* Ordered topological spaces

* Ordered algebraic structures

* Pointfree topology

* Proofs and Types

* Residuated structures

* Semantics

* Stone-type dualities

* Substructural logics

* Topological semantics of modal logic


Submissions
-----------------

Contributed presentations will be of two types:

o 20 minutes long presentations in parallel sessions and

o featured, 30 minutes long, plenary presentations.

The submission of an abstract will be required to be selected for a
contributed presentation of either kind. While preference will be
given to new work, results that have already been published or
presented elsewhere will also be considered. More information on the
submission procedure, as well as a link to the EasyChair system, can
be found at the conference web site.
