Dear All

This "situation" reminds me of the following:

In 1976 Alexandrov was 80 years old.
A. Dold was invited to contribute to the Festschrift,
and so he did. Dold wrote his contribution
in English and it got translated thereafter into Russian.

A little while after the Festschrift had appeared Dold
received a letter from a professional translator who had translated
his paper from Russian into English.



Johannes

P. S. I have now found a reference for "spectral sequence abutting to":

P. 187 of:

J. C. Moore, Cartan's constructions,
Colloque analyse et topologie, en l'honneur de Henri
Cartan, Ast\'erisque  32--33 (1976),  173--221
