		   Call for Participation

	Midlands Graduate School in Computer Science
               14-18 April 2008

          School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham


The Midlands Graduate School (MGS) in the Foundations of Computing
Science provides an intensive course of lectures on the Mathematical
Foundations of Computing. It has run annually since 1999, and is
hosted by the Universites of Birmingham, Leicester, and Nottingham in
rotation. The lectures are aimed at PhD students, typically in their
first or second year of study. However, the school is open to anyone
who is interested in learning more about the mathematical foundations
of computing, and all such participants are warmly welcomed. We also
very much welcome students from abroad. We gratefully acknowledge
financial support by ESPRC.

The following courses will be offered:

Basic Courses:

Category Theory (Neil Ghani, University of Nottingham)
Operational Semantics (Roy Crole, University of Leicester)
Typed Lambda Calculus (Paul Levy, University of Birmingham)

Advanced Courses:

The Mathematical Structure of Information Flow, in Physics, Geometry,
    Logic and Computation. (Samson Abramsky, University of Oxford)
Coq (Thorsten Altenkirch, University of Nottingham)
Denotational Semantics (Martin Escardo, University of Birmingham)
Games for Software Verification (Dan Ghica, University of Birmingham)
Proof Theory (Peter Hancock, University of Nottingham)
Algebraic Methods (Georg Struth, University of Sheffield)


LOCATION

The school will be held  in the School of Computer Science,
University of Birmingham. Birmingham is centrally located  in the UK,
and  is easily reachable by road, rail and air (Birmingham
International Airport).

REGISTRATION

The deadline  for registration is  8 March 2008, and  the registration
fee is 350 UK pounds, including  accomodation.  We also have a
number of free places for UK-based PhD students.  The deadline for
applying for these free places is 15 February 2008. The number of places
is limited, so early registration is advised.
