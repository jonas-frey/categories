Dear Colleagues,

We are delighted to announce the EPSRC/LMS Durham Symposium on "Higher
Structures in M-Theory" to take place 12-18 August 2018 at Durham
University, United Kingdom.

   http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/lms/109/

Recent years have seen significant advances in the development of
higher (categorified) mathematical structures, and there are first and
very encouraging examples of applications of these within string and
M-theory. The intention of this symposium is to bring together experts
working on mathematical aspects of M-theory and experts studying
physical implications of M-theory. Key topics that will be covered
include:

- Higher Differential Geometry and Higher Lie Theory
- Higher Gauge Theory
- Higher Structures in M- and F-Theory
- Double and Exceptional Field Theory and Duality Symmetric String and M-Th=
eory
- Higher (Pre)Quantisation
- Higher Spin Theory

There is a conference fee of =C2=A340. If you are interested in attending,
please visit http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/lms/109/ or contact the
organisers at ma.mt18@durham.ac.uk.

With best wishes,

Branislav Jurco (Charles University)
Christian Saemann (Heriot-Watt University)
Urs Schreiber (Czech Academy of the Sciences)
Martin Wolf (University of Surrey)
