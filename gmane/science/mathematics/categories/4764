We are pleased to announce the following conference:

      Models, Logics and Higher-Dimensional Categories:
         A tribute to the work of Mihaly Makkai

                  19, 20 June 2009

at Centre de Recherche Math\'ematique (CRM) in Montreal

Since the mid 1970s there has been a remarkably successful marriage of ideas
and techniques between category theory on the one hand and model theory and
logic on the other.  This was first distilled in the 1977 monograph "First
Order Categorical Logic"  by M Makkai and G Reyes, which successfully combined
traditional model theory with Grothendieck toposes. In the succeeding years,
Makkai has built up an impressive body of work in several related fields:
categorical model theory, first order logic with dependent sorts, higher
dimensional category theory, and most importantly, a coherent and far reaching
view of categorical logic in mathematical foundations.

Such a meeting is timely for several reasons: not only the occasion of Makkai's
70th birthday year, but also because recently there has been a widening
consensus that traditional model theory might usefully embrace the categorical
methods he pioneered.  Traditional model theory is set-based; in contrast,
there has been an increasing use of category-theoretic (specifically including
sheaf-theoretic) contexts and techniques in recent model-theoretic work in such
areas as algebraic geometry, differential algebra, Mordell-Lang theory, etc.

The focus of the meeting will be traditional model theory, categorical model
theory and logics, and higher-dimensional category theory (the main themes in
Makkai's research career).  We hope to have a number of Michael's former and
current collegues and students as speakers at the meeting, including the
following invited speakers:

Mike Barr
Victor Harnik
Bradd Hart
Andre Joyal
Hal Kierstead
Julia Knight
Francois Lamarche
Robert Par\'e
Anand Pillay
Gonzalo Reyes
Charles Steinhorn
Marek Zawadowski

There may be time for some short contributed talks; if that is possible, we
shall issue a call for proposals when we can.

For further information, please email either Phil Scott <phil@site.uottawa.ca>
or Robert Seely <rags@math.mcgill.ca> (local organizers).
