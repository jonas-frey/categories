                       Call for Contributions

            Workshop on Trends, Extensions, Applications and
             Semantics of Logic Programming (TEASE-LP 2020)
                   Dublin, Ireland, 25 April 2020
                    (co-located with ETAPS 2020)
                       www.coalg.org/tease-lp

Logic programming is a framework for expressing programs, propositions
and relations as Horn clause theories, with the purpose of performing
automatic inference in these theories. Horn clause theories are famous
for their well-understood declarative semantics, in which models of
logic programs are given inductively or coinductively. At the same time,
Horn clauses give rise to efficient inference procedures, usually
involving resolution. Logic programming found applications in type
inference, verification, and AI. While logic programming was originally
conceived for describing simple facts, it was extended to account for
much more complex theories. This includes higher-order theories,
inductive and coinductive data, and stochastic/probabilistic theories.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers that work on
extensions of logic programming and inference methods, and to foster an
exchange of methods and applications that have emerged in different
communities.

Topics
---------------------------
The central idea of this workshop is to discuss the theory of logic
programming and associated topics that have as well the goal to
automatically infer knowledge and proofs. Our intention is to bring
together researchers that work on the numerous topics that contribute to
automatic proof inference and foster an exchange that may lead to
advances in the theory of logic programming.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

     * Proof theory (e.g. focalised and uniform proofs),
     * Logic programming beyond the classical Horn clause theories
       (e.g. coinduction, higher-order Horn clauses, probabilities,
       categorical logic, inductive LP),
     * Extensions of logic programming (e.g. DataLog, description logic,
       relational programming),
     * Advanced implementations (e.g. =CE=BBProlog, ELPI, miniKanren),
     * Type theory (e.g. polarised =CE=BB-calculus, proofs-as-programs,
        types for logic programming),
     * Semantics (e.g. classical, categorical, algebraic, coalgebraic),

     * Applications.

Submission Instructions
---------------------------
Since the aim of the workshop is to foster exchange and discussions
on trends, extensions, applications and semantics of logic programming,
we invite presentations of possibly already published as well as ongoing
work. Submissions should be abstracts of at most two pages in
EPTCS style (http://style.eptcs.org/) and will be only be published in
the informal pre-proceedings and on the website of the workshop.
Post-proceedings volume may be solicited by the PC, based on the quality
of contributions. Contributions should be submitted via the Easychair
system:

   https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=3Dteaselp2020

All contributions will be refereed by the programme committee and it is
expected that at least one of the authors will be present during the
workshop.
