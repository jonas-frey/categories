Dear George,

As I expected, the paper deals with factorization systems (E, M).
It has NOTHING ,  but NOTHING to do with pre foliation, foliations, pre =
fibrations and fibrations, let alone with cartesian functors. here are a =
few reasons, I could give many many more.
Let me call for short a cartesian system a pair (V, K) where V is the =
set of vertical maps and K the set of cartesian maps (in the sense of =
Grothendieck, which I recalled in my mail) of a pre foliation P: X --> S =
.
You can, if you prefer, assume that P is foliation, a pre fibration, or =
even a fibration. The following remarks work in all cases.
.
1.  In (E, M) all the isos are both in E and M. In (V, K) the isos need =
not be in V. In most important cases they will NOT be in V.
2.  In (E, M) each of the classes E and M determines the other.  In =
(V,K)  V determines K, but K does not determine V. The most extreme case =
is the following. Suppose X is a groupoid. For every P: X -> S,  with S =
arbitrary every map of is cartesian (an even hyper cartesian) i.e K(P) =3D=
  X, hence P is a foliation.
Take P =3D id : X --> X  and  Q: X --> 1 the unique functor. They are =
both fibrations, K(P) =3D K(Q) =3D X , but V(P) consists only of the =
identities of X whereas V(Q) is the whole of X
As a side remark factorization systems don't make any sense on a =
groupoid, there is only one, whereas  foliations or fibratons with =
domain a groupoid make perfect sense and are even very important.
3. In (E, M) both E and M are stable by composition, whereas K need not =
be if P is a pre foliation or a pre fibration
4. For every functor P, V(P) satisfies 3 out of 2, i.e. for every =
commutative triangle in X, if 2 of the maps are vertical so is the =
third. This is almost never the case for factorization systems.
5. Factorizations in (E, M) are functorial, they need not be in (V,K) =
for pre foliations , or even pre fibrations
How much more do you need?

Let me add that in the paper you sent me the authors assume that the =
category A, where (E, M) lives admits finite limits and all =
intersections (even large ones) of strong subobjects. This assumption is =
totally irrelevant in my work on fibrations or (pre) foliations

For cartesian functors the situation is even more hopeless. They are =
special morpphisms in Cat/S. As far as I can see, if A and A' are =
categories equipped with factorization systems (E, M) and (E', M') no =
one has seriously defined when a functor F: A --> A'  is a morphism for =
such structures, and if, or when, such definition is given, in view of =
the differences I pointed out, this definition will be completely =
different from my definition of cartesian functors.

Summarizing, the intersection of the paper you sent me and my previous =
mail is EMPTY.

Many thanks nevertheless for focussing my attention on that paper, which =
I shall study in detail very shortly.

Best regards,
Jean
