Dear all:

If we take the filtered poset of finite subsets of I, then taking the=20
finite products of C(2) gives an strict pro group, and this is the=20
example of a "Faux topos", SGA4 SLN 269 page 322.

Now, this example is exhibited as what we some times call Giraud topos=20
(all exactness properties but without generators)

My question is (answer probably well known to the experts):

Are Giraud topoi elementary topoi (that is, do they have an Omega and=20
exponentials) ?

greetings   e.d.
