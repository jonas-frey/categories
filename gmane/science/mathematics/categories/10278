Dear Steve,

thank you for the thoughtful reply. You are correct in that I did not
mean an internal topos, and I should have specified that at the time
of writing I had in mind an elementary topos.

Yes, this is the concept I had in mind. It is less clear to me if, in
addition to finite limits, it would be easier to ask for cartesian
closedness+subobject classifier or for power objects. The latter seems
to me to be simpler, at least in the case when the 2-category admits a
construction analogous to E |---> Rel(E) (not that I know how to do
it, but it seems a reasonable first line of attack). There should be
some 1-arrow in the/an ambient 2-category with an adjoint giving the
power object and the universal relation \in.

One result that would indicate this is on the right track is that a
topos object in Cat should just be an elementary topos (with specified
finite limits, power objects), a topos object in Cat_ana (anafunctors
instead of functors) should be a topos (with *unspecified* finite
limits and power objects), a topos object in Fib(B) should be a fibred
topos, and a topos object in Cat_cocomp should be a cocomplete topos.
I'd be interested to hear (even if off-list) your ideas relating to
arithmetic universes (AUs). I could imagine asking for a topos object
in categories over an AU. Or perhaps in some kind of syntactic
2-category. For an even more exotic example, imagine taking the
2-category of be of the sort Riehl and Verity use for their synthetic
\infty-cateogry work. Then one might argue that a topos object in such
a 2-category is a candidate for an elementary (\infty,1)-topos, since
these 2-categories are meant to have as objects (\infty,1)-categories.

The question of what morphisms to take is then an even more
interesting question. The easiest answer is that one could ask for
logical morphisms. But clearly this is not sufficient for all
purposes. If looking for geometric morphisms I would myself aim for
something like logos morphisms (=C3=A0 la Anel=E2=80=93Joyal), namely left =
exact
cocontinuous arrows, considering these as morphisms in the opposite
category.

Best regards,

David Roberts

then the theory of toposes is cartesian (aka essentially algebraic), so if =
=E2=80=9Ctopos object=E2=80=9D means =E2=80=9Cinternal topos=E2=80=9D (just=
  as eg =E2=80=9Cgroup object=E2=80=9D means =E2=80=9Cinternal group=E2=80=
=9D), then there is a standard notion of topos object, model of that cartes=
ian theory, in any 1-category with finite limits. At least, if you take the=
  topos structure to be canonically given.

ing of a single object, with its category structure implied by the ambient =
2-cells? For instance, in a 2-category with finite products, a =E2=80=9Cfin=

but of =E2=80=9Call=E2=80=9D colimits and finite limits as in Giraud=E2=80=
=99s theorem. I find it a very interesting question when an object in a 2-c=
ategory might have topos structure in that sense.

  Eg for binary products, n=3D2, map (U, V) |-> UxV. (U, V are points of O, =
ie sets. The construction is geometric and so does give a geometric morphis=
m.) The infinitary colimits are harder. I conjecture that they are given by=
  M-algebra structure for O, where M is the symmetric topos monad on C. That=
  should all lift to O^X.

a related 2-category based on arithmetic universes.
