Formulating the *future *with category theory?  My understanding is that
the *present *is already formulated less with set theory than with category
theory, at least its morphisms under composition, and has been for a long
time.

In 1969 Jack Schwartz introduced the programming language SETL based on set
theory.  However programmers found it much easier to write programs as
functions composed from simpler functions than to implement them with sets
based on membership, and SETL never caught on.

There have also been sporadic attempts to introduce set theory into K-12
mathematics, under such rubrics as "New maths", starting with the
operations of union and intersection, but these have not caught on either.

Category theory is an abstract formulation of functions taking composition
as the primitive operation.  Functions are in wide use in both mathematics
and software.  Whenever a function calls another function from within it,
that's composition.

In recent years I've been promoting a viewpoint of algebra that emphasizes
the associativity of composition as the root of not just algebra but
bialgebra in the sense of typed Chu spaces.  The defining properties of
both homomorphisms and Chu transforms follow from associativity.  My most
recent talk on this was at FMCS in June, the "ten" slides are here
<http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/fmcs.pdf>.  (They're less cryptic when the
speaker is there to explain them, especially with an audience of only one
or two and with no time pressure.)

One might call this "category light" by virtue of working in the *class*
CAT, i.e. just categories, no functors etc.  By Yoneda (unintended pun
there, it's actually "biYoneda")  the functors are there, they're just
"under the hood".  Just as you only need to know what sort of engine is in
the car you're driving if you have to service it, you only need to know
about functors, natural transformations, etc. when you become a "category
mechanic" so to speak.

Sets are automatic because they arise wherever morphisms gather together in
those spaces we call homsets.
