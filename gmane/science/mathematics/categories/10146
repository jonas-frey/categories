28th Foundational Methods in Computer Science Workshop
Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics
University of Ottawa
June 9-12, 2020


Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop that brings =
together researchers in theoretical computer science and category theory. P=
ast workshops have enjoyed talks in areas such as categorical quantum mecha=
nics, restriction categories, database design, and the differential and res=
ource logics. We will host tutorials and talks in several of these and rela=
ted areas. We especially encourage graduate students to talk.

We anticipate having talks and tutorials for the entire day on June 9,10 an=
d 11, with the possibility of additional talks on the morning of the 12th, =
depending on how many talks are volunteered.

This year, FMCS will immediately follow the 2020 Canadian Mathematical Soci=
ety Summer Meeting, also held in Ottawa. We suggest attendees check out the=
  schedule for that conference as there are a number of sessions of interest=
  to category theorists.

Support for graduate students:

We particularly encourage graduate students to attend FMCS and to present t=
heir work. Some limited funding is available to support graduate students w=
ho wish to attend FMCS. To obtain the discounted registration and to apply =
for this funding you should contact one of the local organizers by April 1s=
t, 2020.

Talks:

Anyone interested in giving a talk or tutorial should contact the local org=
anizers, no later than May 15th. But earlier is better.

Housing:

We were unable to reserve housing in the campus dorms, but there will likel=
y be some individual rooms available. Details can be found here:

https://www.uottawa.ca/housing/summer-accommodation

Some good hotels in the area are:

1-The Business Inn, 180 MacLaren Street. https://thebusinessinn.com/ (This =
is the best local option.)

2-The Swiss Hotel, 89 Daly Avenue. https://swisshotel.ca/

3-Alt Hotel, Ottawa, 185 Slater Street. https://www.althotels.com/en/ottawa=
/

It is recommended not to wait until the last minute to book accommodations.

Registration:

There will be a small registration fee. It will help to cover refreshments =
and subsidize students.
