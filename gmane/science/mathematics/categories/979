    PhD degrees in the Division of Informatics
    at the University of Edinburgh

In 1998, the University of Edinburgh established a Division of
Informatics, to study the structure, behaviour and
interactions of both natural and artificial computational systems.
The Division reflects the University's vision of Informatics
as a fundamental area of study, critical for the future developments
in science, engineering, and society. The Division was formed from
the former Departments of Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive
Science and Computer Science.

The Division has positions for new research degree students pursing
either an MSc(Research) (one year), an MPhil (two years) or a PhD
(three years) through investigation of open problems in Informatics.

The Division now contains over 75 academic staff and about 100 research
students, grouped primarily into these research institutes:

	Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute
	Institute of Computing System Architecture
	Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation
	Institute for Communicating and Collaborative Systems
	Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour
	Institute for Representation and Reasoning
	Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science

which reflect the main research themes in the Division:

	adaptive computing
	artificial intelligence
	automated and mathematical reasoning
	category and type theory
	cognitive science
	computational complexity
	computational learning theory
	computational linguistics and natural language processing
	computational musicology
	computer and network architectures
	computer communications and networks
	computer graphics and virtual reality
	computer science
	computer vision
	database systems
	design and analysis of dependable systems
	diagramatic understanding
	distributed systems
	formal program specification
	human-computer interaction
	intelligent tutoring systems
	knowledge representation and reasoning
	knowledge-based systems
	medical informatics
	mobile and assembly robotics
	neural modelling
	neural networks
	parallel, distributed and concurrent systems
	planning and activity management
	programming languages
	qualitative and fuzzy reasoning
	software engineering
	speech understanding and generation
	system level design and integration

The UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council
has awarded the Division a number of full studentships
that can be used by UK and EC students. Overseas students
may be eligible for ORS awards, that pay approximately
half of the total costs.

In general, students should have a good BS/BSc degree (or equivalent)
in an appropriate topic, plus other skills appropriate to the particular
research area.
