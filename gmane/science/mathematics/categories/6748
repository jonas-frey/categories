Dear Andre=2CI welcome your suggestion of involving stacks in order to test=
  universality when the base topos S does not have Choice. I have been explo=
iting this implicitly but systematically several times since my own constru=
ction of the stack completion of a category object C in any Grothendieck to=
pos S (Cahiers=2C 1979). For instance=2C I have used it crucially in my pap=
er on Galois groupoids and covering morphisms (Fields=2C 2004)=2C not only =
in distinguishing between Galois groupoids from fundamental groupoids=2C bu=
t also for a neat way of (well) defining the fundamental groupoid topos of =
a Grothendieck topos as the limit of a filtered 1-system of discrete groupo=
ids=2C obtained from the naturally arising bifiltered 2-system of such by t=
aking stack completions. This relates to the last remark you make in your p=
osting. Concerning S_fin=2C it does not matter if=2C in constructing the ob=
ject classifier=2C one uses its stack completion instead=2C since S is a st=
ack (Bunge-Pare=2C Cahiers=2C 1979). In my opinion=2C stacks should be the =
staple food of category theory without Choice. For instance=2C an anafuncto=
r (Makkai's terminology) from C to D is precisely a functor from C to the s=
tack completion of D. More recently (Bunge-Hermida=2C MakkaiFest=2C 2011)=
=2C we have carried out the 2-analogue of the 1-dimensional case along the =
same lines of the 1979 papers=2C by constructing the 2-stack completion of =
a 2-gerbe in "exactly the same way". Concerning this=2C I have a question f=
or you. Is there a model structure on 2-Cat(S) (or 2-Gerbes(S))=2C for S a =
Grothedieck topos=2C whose weak equivalences are the weak 2-equivalence 2-f=
unctors=2C and whose fibrant objects are precisely the (strong) 2-stacks? A=
lthough not needed for our work=2C the question came up naturally after you=
r paper with Myles Tierney. We could find no such construction in the liter=
ature.  With best regards=2C Marta
