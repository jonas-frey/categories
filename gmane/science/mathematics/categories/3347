CALL FOR PAPERS

4th International Workshop on Model-based Methodologies for
Pervasive and Embedded Software (MOMPES 2007)

http://www.di.uminho.pt/mompes

within the 7th European Joint Conferences on Theory and
Practice of Software (ETAPS 2007)
http://www.di.uminho.pt/etaps07/

Braga - Portugal
March 31, 2007

******************************************************************
Model Based Development (MBD) comprises approaches to software
development, which heavily rely on modelling and the systematic
transition from models to executable code. One of these approaches
is the OMG=92s Model Driven Architecture (MDA), which is based on
the separation between the specification of a system and its
implementation using specific platforms.

This workshop focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects
related with the adoption of MDA and other MBD methodologies
(notation, process, methods, and tools) for supporting the
construction of computer-based systems, and more specifically,
pervasive and embedded software.

Suggested areas of interest in the workshop include, but are
not restricted to:
- Specification of Platform Independent Models (PIMs) and
Platform Specific Models (PSMs)
- PIM to PSM transformations
- MBD process for embedded and pervasive software
- Automatic code generation in MBD
- Testing and validation in MBD
- Tools for MBD of embedded and pervasive software
- Model-based development of hardware and software systems
- Model-based architectures
- Meta-Models for MBD
- System evolution and maintenance
- Precise semantics and consistency checks in MBD
- Integration of feature modelling
- Case studies on the application of MBD
- Models and techniques to enhance the security of embedded
and pervasive software

The official language is English.
Authors are requested to submit a PDF version of their papers in
IEEE format.
Papers should not exceed 10 pages, including figures, references,
and appendices.
Submitted papers will be reviewed by at least 3 PC members.
Authors of accepted papers must sign the IEEE copyright form.
Full papers exceeding 10 pages will be charged for pages in excess.
At least one author of each accepted submission must register
and present the paper at the workshop.
The proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press.
Position papers will be published online.
Submissions by email to mompes@di.uminho.pt
