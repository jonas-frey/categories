The proof of Proposition 2.7.1 on page 59 in Volume I of "Handbook of =
Categorical Algebra" by Francis Borceux may be a candidate.  John Gray =
once told me that the proof is due to Peter Freyd.  When I was studying =
category theory in graduate school, proofs of this proposition, the =
Adjoint Functor Theorem, and some other results in "Categories, =
Allegories" struck me as demonstrating a creative, original, and =
insightful use of limits and colimits.
