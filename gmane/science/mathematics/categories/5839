Dear Andr=E9

There seems to me to be a tremendous amount of great work going on=20
higher category theory, but when you write

-----------------------------------------------------
One lies in the fact that equivalent categories are considered to be the =

"same",=20

even if [or] when they are not isomorphic.
-----------------------------------------

this seems to go against the grain of what I have been doing in groupoids=
  since I decided they were valuable in about 1965! It sounds like the old=
  canard `groupoids reduce to groups', so there must be some confusion in =
my mind on what you are saying.=20

One thing that took me a while to realise was that it was not enough to s=
tudy the fundamental groupoid or a fundamental group but one needed to co=
nsider intermediate cases, namely the fundamental groupoid on a set of ba=
se points chosen according to the geometry at hand. (`Algebraic topology'=
  has not understood this it seems.) The vertices of a groupoid give a spa=
tial component to group theory, a kind of geography, and sometimes, even =
often, that is needed to model the geometry.  So for example it is useful=
  to replace the trefoil group which has 2 generators x,y and one relation=
  x^2=3Dy^3 by the trefoil groupoid which is the double mapping cylinder (=
homotopy pushout) in groupoids of the two maps Z \to Z, given by squaring=
  and cubing. So we add an extra groupoid generator iota on different vert=
ices which turns x^2 into y^3. This corresponds to the double mapping con=
struction to give a CW-complex.=20

So groupoids give the strict algebra of keeping the information which mak=
es things the same.=20

In higher dimensions we want not just commutative diagrams but control of=
  the ways of filling these diagrams. If the diagram is a pentagon (as we =
all know does happen) I would want a pentagon as part of the geometry, an=
d the only question is how to deal with multiple compositions of various =
such objects, and that was the aim of David Jones thesis on Polyhedral T-=
complexes. The point is that the pieces to be composable have to be all f=
aces but one of a general poyhedral `horn', the process of composing them=
  is the filler of the horn, and the composite of the pieces  is the remai=
ning face of the filler. (It was not attempted to do this in category rat=
her than groupoid terms, and that is still a mystery!) So you can see I h=
ave long been very sympathetic to using the Kan condition for describing =
algebraic or structural objects, but find the simplicial approach too awk=
ward (for me, of course; I found the way Nick Ashley coped with that was =
amazing).=20

I do not want to consider equivalent groupoids the same, as I may want to=
  use the spatial components to describe how they might be glued together.=
  It is partly the old tag of not throwing away information till the last =
possible moment.=20

On the other hand, some computations are best done at the strict level, r=
ather than the weak one. I mention here the rotations in my paper:

``Higher dimensional group theory'', in {\em Low dimensional topology},  =
London Math Soc. Lecture Note Series 48 (ed. R. Brown and T.L.  Thickstun=
, Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. 215-238.

(see also a fuller exposition in the new book on Nonabelian algebraic top=
ology), which would seem to be more difficult to write out at the lax lev=
el. The fact that the strict calculations imply the existence of certain =
homotopies is part of the interest.=20

So in the work with Higgins a Kan fibration - from the singular filtered =
complex of a filtered space to the quotient to give a strict structure - =
ties in the lax and the strict in a necessary way for the theory and calc=
ulations.=20

I am really searching for points of agreement.=20

Best regards

Ronnie
