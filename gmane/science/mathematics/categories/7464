IMLA 2013

6th Workshop on Intuitionistic Modal Logic and Applications
https://sites.google.com/site/imodallogic2013/

Affiliated with the 4th World Congress on Universal Logic [UNILOG 2013]
http://uni-log.org/start4.html

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
April 3-7, 2013


Constructive modal logics and type theories are of increasing foundational
and practical relevance in computer science. Applications of constructive
modal logics
are in type disciplines for programming languages, meta-logics for
reasoning about a
variety of computational phenomena and explanatory frameworks in
philosophical logic.

The workshop aims at developing and explaining theoretical and
methodological issues centered around the question of how the
proof-theoretic strengths of
constructive logics can best be combined with the model-theoretic strengths
of modal logics.
Practical issues center around the question of which modal connectives with
associated laws
or proof rules capture computational phenomena accurately and at the right
level of
abstraction.

In its sixth edition, the Workshop on Intuitionistic Modal Logic and
Applications will take place in Rio de Janeiro at the feet of the Sugar
Loaf at the military
school EsCEME. Previous editions of this conference were held: as part of
the 14th
Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science, Nancy, France, 25
July, 2011, as part
of LiCS2008, Pittsburgh, USA, as part of LiCS2005, Chicago, USA, of
FLoC2002, Copenhagen, Denmark and
as part of FLoC1999, Trento, Italy.

Topics of interest  include, but are not limited to:

* Modal Logics
* Logical frameworks
* Proof theory
* Type theory
* Automated deduction
* Formal semantics of languages and systems
* Applications

IMLA 2013 also aims to be a forum for presenting and discussing work
in progress, and therefore to provide feedback to authors on their
preliminary research.


Submissions

Contributions should be written in English and submitted in the form
of full papers (with a maximum of 12 pages) or short papers (with
a maximum of 6 pages). They must be unpublished and not submitted
simultaneously for publication elsewhere. The papers should be prepared
in latex using EPTCS style. The submission should be in the form of a
PDF file uploaded to IMLA 2013 page at Easychair

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=imla2013

until the submission deadline in December 1st, by midnight, Central
European Standard Time (GMT+1).

The workshop pre-proceedings will be handed-out at workshop registration.

At least one of the authors should register at the conference.


Important Dates

Paper submission deadline: December 1st, 2012
Author notification: January 15th, 2013
