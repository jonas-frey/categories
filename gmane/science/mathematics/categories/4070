On a related matter to the message below by Jiri, let me point out the
following paper:

   M. Fiore.  Differential structure in models of multiplicative
   biadditive intuitionistic linear logic.  In Typed Lambda Calculi
   and Applications (TLCA 2007), LNCS 4583, pp. 163-177, 2007.
   [Available from <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/latest.html>]

presenting a categorical framework for differentiation, directly
synthetised from the differential calculus of generalised species
of structures.  Though, as it transpired in conversation with Anders
Kock, the setting is also applicable to convenient vector spaces
and some models of SDG.
