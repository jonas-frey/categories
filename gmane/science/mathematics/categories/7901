Hi all,

I have been reading some back issues of this list, and there are several cr=
yptic comments about JPAA winding up after TAC started publishing. I vaguel=
y recall that TAC was founded by editors and former editors of JPAA in orde=
r to give category theorists a journal that was not in the clutches of a co=
mmercial publisher. Could anyone enlighten me about what happened in the mi=
d-90s leading to TAC being founded? (I am aware of the general situation wr=
t publishing, costs and corporate mergers.) Clearly the discussions were be=
hind closed doors and all that came out at the time was the public announce=
ment

http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/catlist/1999/elec-journal

I would be happy with private replies, as I suspect that the moderator may =
find discussion about this off-topic; if so, I beg his indulgence in allowi=
ng this posting through.

Regards,

David Roberts=
