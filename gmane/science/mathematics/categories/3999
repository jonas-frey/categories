That's not really fair; there's a long history in English,
when adopting a foreign noun, of adopting the foreign plural as well
(then switching to an "-s" plural when the noun becomes less foreign,
 or occasionally using the plural form only as a collective noun).
However, this practice uses only one case, usually nominative.

So by saying "topoi", one pretends that "topos" is a real Greek word
(in this sense) and that it's still a foreign word with a foreign plural.
This pretence is an affectation, certainly, but it is complete in itself.
