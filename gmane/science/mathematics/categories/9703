Dear colleagues,

I am writing to solicit applications for researchers who wish to attend =
a semester program at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in =
Berkeley, CA to take place from January 21 - May 29, 2020 on the theme =
of Higher Categories and Categorification. A complementary program on =
Quantum Symmetries will be happening in parallel.

More details about the scientific plan for the program can be found =
here:
http://www.msri.org/programs/323 <http://www.msri.org/programs/323>
You=E2=80=99ll note in particular the program=E2=80=99s goal to bring =
together both users of and experts in higher category theory.

MSRI supports research affiliates in three categories:

Research Professors (applications due October 1)

I am happy to answer any questions about MSRI or the application =
process. Logistical questions can also be addressed to Chris Marshall, =
the MSRI program director (chris@msri.org <mailto:chris@msri.org>).

On behalf of the organizers,
David Ayala, Clark Barwick, David Nadler, Emily Riehl, Marcy Robertson, =
