Dear Luc,

Is that all you want, or would you like k and l to be unique, or unique up =
to isomorphism in the sense that there is an isomorphism across the diagona=
l of the=20
commutative in C created by two such pairs making the whole diagram commute=
?

If so, for unique up to isomorphism, such a functor is called a Conduch\'{e=
} fibration, and for unique, it is called a discrete Conduch\'{e} fibration=
.=A0 There is a discussion of these and related notions in the n-Lab articl=
e on Conduch\'{e} functors:

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Conduch%C3%A9+functor

Best Thoughts,
David Yetter

P.S. Not in reply to the question.  I'd be interested if anyone knows nice =
constructions of discrete Conduch\'{e} fibrations.  It turns out that a dis=
crete Conduch\'{e} fibration over a category with all arrows monic satisfyi=
ng the right Ore condition (all cospans complete to commutative squares) wi=
th another lifting property,  all functors induced on slice categories spli=
t, are the ingredients for a construction of C*-algebras generalizing the p=
opular graph and k-graph C*-algebras of Raeburn, Kumjian, Pask and their sc=
hool.=20

Subject: categories: Functors arising from a relational Grothendieck constr=
uction
=A0  =20
Dear Category Theorists,

with my adviser Damiano Mazza and his other student Pierre Vial, we are loo=
king
for a name =96 or even better, a reference =96 for the following kind of fu=
nctors:

Let C and B be two categories, F : C ---> D a functor satisfying, for all
morphisms f:c -> c' in C:
- if Ff =3D g \circ h, then there exists two morphisms k,l such that
=A0 + f =3D k \circ l=20
=A0 + Fk =3D g
=A0 + Fl =3D h
- if Ff =3D id_a for a certain object a, then f itself is an identity.

These functors arise when applying the Grothendieck construction to relatio=
nal
presheaves: P : B ---> Rel. Indeed, the category of relational presheaves o=
n B
is equivalent (through the Grothendieck construction) to a category whose
objects are such functors over B.

If anyone could point us in a right direction, it would be much appreciated=
.

Best,

=97 Luc
