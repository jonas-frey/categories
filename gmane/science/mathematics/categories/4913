Of course; it's a matter of convenience, not excitement.

Here's what you missed:
Academia: Academics can freely use ideas if they cite them,

Industry: Companies must pay to use patented ideas,
 even if they come up with the idea indpendently,
 at whatever rate (possibly prohibitive) set by the owner of the patent.
