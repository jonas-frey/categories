A category "is skeletal" if for each isomorphism A --> B the objects
A and B are the same object (A =3D B). With this in mind, the phrase
"and only one" in Golblatt's quoted definition is superfluous, being
a consequence of (rather than a condition required for) the definition.

Once one has a _choice_ of isomorphism from each object of C to =

the (unique) object of a skeleton of C that it's isomorphic to
(but it may take the axiom of choice to be assured of such an iso), =

any two skeleta of C become isomorphic to each other. There's =

no inherent "order" among the various possible skeleta of C.

Data making the inclusion into C of any full subcategory that =

is a skeleton of C an equivalence of categories IS precisely
such a "choice of isomorphism from each object of C to the
(unique) object of a skeleton of C that it's isomorphic to"
mentioned above.

There's little hope of skel becoming a functor without data =

of the sort just mentioned. Probably the strong temptation =

to "wish" that the full inclusion {SKEL} --> {CAT} (of the
full subcategory of skeletal categories among all categories)
were an equivalence of categories, or at least the inclusion =

of a full reflexive subcategory (with skel as inverse, or at =

least, reflection back down), is one to be steer clear of, =

if at all possible, in general.

Cheers,
