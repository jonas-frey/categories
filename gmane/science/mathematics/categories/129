Dear Andrew

This is what Lawvere told me about once, long ago.
I think he called it the Isbell envelope; that is what I've called it
ever since. It has nice properties. Lawvere explained that, applied
to finite dimensional vector spaces, it fully contains the category
of banach spaces and bounded linear maps. (I think I've got that
right; it's awhile since I checked it.)
