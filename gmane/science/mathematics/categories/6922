Enriching over pointed sets you will end up with functors which must
preserve the undefined composites, something a little awkward to require.
The above treatment does not do that, but the concepts are developed ad hoc
from scratch.

A more sophisticated notion of 'partial category' is that of *paracategory*=
,
introduced by P. Freyd. Here, the partial composites must satisfy a certain
'saturation' condition. The general context for such a theory is that
of *partial
algebras*, which admit an abstract notion of *saturation*. In this context,
saturation is equivalent to a representation result which embeds any partia=
l
algebra in a total one (using the notion of Kleene morphism, which reflect
definedness of composites, rather than preserving them) . This theory is
given in

*Theoretical Computer
Science*<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03043975>
Volume 309, Issues
1-3, 2 December 2003, Pages 125-156

Such a general theory can then be instantiated in various contexts:
categories, multicategories and indexed categories are treated in

which develops the basic 2-category theory of paracategories, inlcuding
adjunctions, limits, etc. The most relevant example (for which
paracategories were introduced) is that of bivariant functors and dinatural
transformations, which constitute a cartesian closed paracategory.

Finally, I'd like to mention that paracategories have been used to study
certain models of quatum compuation in the thesis of O. Malherbe:
