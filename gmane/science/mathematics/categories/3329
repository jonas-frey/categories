                    Algebra, Meaning, and Computation:
           A Festschrift Symposium in Honor of Joseph Goguen


                         THIRD CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

        !!!URGENT: HOTEL ROOMS MUST BE BOOKED SOON!!!


 Joseph Goguen is one of the most prominent computer scientists
 worldwide.  His numerous research contributions span many topics and
 have changed the way we think about many concepts.  Our views about
 data types, programming languages, software specification and
 verification, computational behavior, logics in computer science,
 semiotics, interface design, multimedia, and consciousness, to
 mention just some of the areas, have all been enriched in fundamental
 ways by his ideas.

A Symposium to honor Joseph Goguen on his 65th birthday on June 28,
2006 will be held at the Computer Science and Engineering Department
of the University of California in San Diego (UCSD) in June 27-29
2006.  There will also be an IFIP WG1.3 meeting co-located with the
Symposium that will take place on June 30.  Leading researchers in the
different areas spanned by Joseph Goguen's work have contributed over
thirty papers to the Festschrift volume being published by
Springer-Verlag.  These papers will be presented at the Symposium in a
three full day programme.  A Symposium banquet is planned for June 28
to celebrate Joseph Goguen's 65th Birthday.  The Symposium organizers
welcome participation by any members of the scientific community who
would like to take part in this important event.

LOCAL INFORMATION AND VENUE

The UCSD Campus is located in La Jolla, on top of a spectacular mesa
overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  The Symposium, and also the IFIP WG1.3
meeting, will be held at UCSD's Computer Science Department.  The town
of La Jolla is one of the most beautiful in the California Coast.
Weather in June should be very pleasant, typically around 25 degrees
Celsius, mostly sunny but possibly with some morning coastal fog.

La Jolla is easy to reach from the San Diego Airport (see below).  All
major US airlines fly into San Diego from other main hubs like Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Washington DC, New York, Chicago, Dallas, and
so on.

The Festschrift Symposium in Honor of Joseph Goguen is being
hosted by the Jacobs School of Engineering's Department of Computer
Science and Engineering.  The meetings will be held in the Computer
Science and Engineering Building's main Auditorium, room 1202.
