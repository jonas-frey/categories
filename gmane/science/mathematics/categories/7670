Eduardo Pareja-Tobes replied with quite a long discussion of filtered
categories, but I am not sure whether he made the following point clear.

Any group (the two-element one will do) considered as a one-object
category has the property that David mentioned.

However, it is not "filtered" in the sense of Chapter IX, Section 1
of Mac Lane's "Categories for the Working Mathematician".

You have to look carefully at the printed diagram to see this.

Whilst any (co)span in a group may be completed to a commutative square,
a parallel pair does not have a common composite in this sense:

    ------->
   X         Y -------> Z
    ------->

David's definitive language suggests that he knows this and does not
require this property of his categories,   but other people who
want to generalise ideas from posets to categories might fall into
this trap.

Maybe "amalgamation property" would be suitable for David, although
usage of that term in the literature might require the maps to be monos.
