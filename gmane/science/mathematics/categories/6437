A little more detail: The opens in the lattice of congruences
are determined by the "compacts" of this algebraic
lattice.  These are the finitely generated congruences.
If F is one such, then the open it determines is
{E | F subset E}.  They form a basis for the "Scott"
topology.  A subbasis is given by the sets {E | aEb}
indicated by Barr.
