I regret to announce that last week I received the information that Rudolf =
Fritsch had died.  Here is the email I received from his wife Gerda:


Dear Mike,

in the early morning hours of Tuesday, June 12th, 2018, my husband passed a=
way.
Please find the notice of death in the attachment. Rudo suggested that you =
might want to distribute the message on the categories list.

Sincerely yours,
Gerda Fritsch

The attachment was too large to post on the categories list.

Michael
