As to the cocompleteness of Omega-Cat, it is a result of Harvey Wolff that
V-Cat is cocomplete for decent  V.  By induction, it follows that n-Cat is
cocomplete (since (n+1)-Cat = n-Cat).  A limiting process gives that
Omega-Cat is also cocomplete.

However, a better approach is to use a result of Michael Batanin that
Omega-Cat is finitarily monadic over globular sets (a presheaf category).
It follows that  Omega-Cat  is cocomplete.

The required monad on globular sets is beautiful: it involves plane trees. See:

theory of weak n-categories, Advances in Mathematics 136 (1998) 39-103.
