For Saunders, the terminology of category theory came from Kant.?? From
Wikipedia:

In Kant's philosophy, a category (German: Categorie in the original or
Kategorie in modern German) is a *pure concept of the understanding
(Verstand)*.

Etc.?? It may be relevant that Saunders was very influenced by his time
at Gottingen.
In any case, the term category theory was second nature to him. Although
that was well before my time, I'm quite sure he used the term pretty
much from the beginning.
