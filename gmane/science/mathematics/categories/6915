9TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON REWRITING LOGIC AND ITS APPLICATIONS

WRLA 2012

Tallinn, Estonia, March 24-25, 2012

http://wrla2012.lcc.uma.es/

The workshop will be held in conjunction with ETAPS 2012
14th European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
March 24 - April 1, 2012
http://www.etaps.org/2012

IMPORTANT DATES

December 14, 2011 Deadline for submission
January 18, 2012 Author notification
Early February, 2010 Final version in electronic form


AIMS AND SCOPE

Rewriting logic (RL) is a natural model of computation and an =

expressive semantic framework for concurrency, parallelism, =

communication, and interaction. It can be used for specifying =

a wide range of systems and languages in various application =

fields. It also has good properties as a metalogical framework =

for representing logics. In recent years, several languages =

based on RL (ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been designed =

and implemented. The aim of the workshop is to bring together =

researchers with a common interest in RL and its applications, =

and to give them the opportunity to present their recent works, =

discuss future research directions, and exchange ideas.

The topics of the workshop comprise, but are not limited to,
  - foundations and models of RL;
  - languages based on RL, including implementation issues;
  - RL as a logical framework;
  - RL as a semantic framework, including applications of RL to
      - object-oriented systems,
      - concurrent and/or parallel systems,
      - interactive, distributed, open ended and mobile systems,
      - specification of languages and systems;
  - use of RL to provide rigorous support for model-based software =

    engineering;
  - formalisms related to RL, including
      - real-time and probabilistic extensions of RL,
      - rewriting approaches to behavioral specifications,
      - tile logic;
  - verification techniques for RL specifications, including
      - equational and coherence methods, and
      - verification of properties expressed in first-order, =

        higher-order, modal and temporal logics;
  - comparisons of RL with existing formalisms having analogous aims;
  - application of RL to specification and analysis of
      - distributed systems,
      - physical systems.

SUBMISSIONS

Papers must contain original contributions, be clearly written, =

and include appropriate reference to and comparison with related =

work. They must be unpublished and not submitted simultaneously =

for publication elsewhere. Papers should not exceed 15 pages, =

should be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer =

LNCS papers, and should be submitted electronically using EasyChair.

The final program of the workshop will also include system =

demonstrations and invited presentations to be determined.

Submissions will be evaluated by the Program Committee for =

inclusion in the proceedings, which will be published by the =

organization of ETAPS. As for WRLA 2010, we are negotiating the =

publications of a volume in the Springer's LNCS series as =

post-proceedings.

Depending on the number and the quality of the contributions, we will =

consider the preparation of a special issue in some scientific journal =

in the field with extended versions of a selection of the papers of =

the workshop.
