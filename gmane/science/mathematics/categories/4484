I was expecting Peter Lumsdaine to reply to this, but perhaps he's away.

In discussions with Steve Awodey and myself, Peter recently established
the fact that every co-category in a pretopos is a co-equivalence
relation; more specifically, the "co-domain" and "co-codomain" maps
(sorry, but I can't see any other way to describe them) are the
cokernel pair of a (unique) monomorphism (namely, their equalizer).
