This is very sad news: Horst was a personality which profoundly influenced
the development of category theory. Even before meeting him personally I
was enchanted by his lecture notes on topological reflections and
corelfections. And a couple of years later during his visit in Prague we
started an intense collaboration that lasted over thirty years. His
enthusiasm and his broad field of knowledge and interests was a great
source of energy and inspiration for people around Horst. And at times of
isolation in the seventieth and eightieth in socialist Prague Horst's
visits had a tremendous impact. I will never forget the years of writing
our joint book with George Strecker- before email in Prague and with
every letter checked (for weeks) by secret police... Typically for Horst
during his illness he was spreading jokes and pieces of information among
his friends, never mentioning any of his problems. This is why the news of
his passing has come completely unexpectedly. This is a great loss for me.
