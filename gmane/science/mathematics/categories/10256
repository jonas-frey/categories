This is NOT an open question, despite being stated as such in Jaap van
Oosten's book; indeed, I knew the answer before Ieke raised the question at
Jaap's PhD viva (but Ieke never bothered to ask me ...). There is a proof
in my paper "Geometric morphisms of realizability toposes", TAC 28 (2013),
241.
