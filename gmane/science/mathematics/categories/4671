A Young Research Fellow Position at IMT, Lucca, Italy
Computer Science and Engineering

Deadline December 1st, 2008

IMT Institute for Advanced Studies invites strong candidates active
on networking and software systems for global computing, including
web data mining and mobile systems, with applications e.g. to service
oriented computing, economics and embedded systems, to apply for a
Faculty Position at the Assistant Professor or Post-Doctoral Fellow
level. Preference will be given to candidates combining in their
research fundamental and application oriented aspects.

Preference will be given to candidates with a Ph.D. degree (or close
to completion), or candidates with experience in formal instruction
at the graduate-level.

The selected candidate will be appointed for a term of up to three
years. The contract may be renewed once for additional 3 years (i.e.
six year in total). The remuneration package is competitive at the
international level and include generous research funds. Additional
benefits may be negotiated with selected applicants.

Assistant Professors are senior positions and differ from
Post-doctoral Fellows on the basis of experience, scientific
curriculum and remuneration.

Successful candidates for either type of position will work closely
with other young researchers, senior researchers and graduate
students, and will have a limited teaching load in the school's
graduate program (e.g. one class per year).

Application Procedure
Applicants are required to fill out the online application form and
upload a complete curriculum vitae and one research paper (published
or working paper) as PDF files. Please note that you are also
required to upload a signed copy of your Identity Document.

Online applications only at:
http://www.imtlucca.it/faculty/positions/young-research-fellows_positions/call_for_applications_in_computer_sciences_and_engineering.php

Candidates are required to indicate if they intend to apply only for
one of the two positions offered (Assistant Professor and
Post-doctoral Fellow) or for both. Please note that if you apply for
both positions you do not need to submit two applications.

In addition, at least two letters of reference must be sent as e-mail
attachments (preferably in PDF format) to: yrf.opening@imtlucca.it or
by mail to the following address:
