Dear Eduardo,

Of course I fully agree with what you said. Let me just add a few =
remarks.
=20
When Grothendieck defined fibrations it was for precise purposes, namely =
to axiomatize the notion of inverse image, and to use this =
axiomatization for descent (the titles of his talks are quite clear =
about that)

My view about fibrations is to try to get rid of sets, as much as =
possible, in category theory. This is what I tried to explain in my =
paper at the JSL.
Thus if some fibrations arising from set theory come equipped with more =
or less artificial cleavages, it does not impress me at all.=20

The same process of elimination of sets, makes very sensitive, for =
fibrations but also for other domains, to the possibility of =
internalization.

Let me give an example of a totally different nature. In the paper where =
I introduced bicategories, their definition is in section 1.1 and takes =
3 pages. But immediately after, it took me 10 pages to show in detail =
that they could be internalized, in any category with pullbacks. Let me =
point out that this paper was written in 1966 and published in 1967.

I think of course that ZFC has been a huge progress in the history of =
mathematics, but category theory has given us the possibility to explore =
new and fascinating countries. This goes for many domains of =
mathematics, and in particular.... for fibered categories.

Best to all,
Jean

faced to the need to produce a proof, if you succeed to find one without =

cleavage arguing. It will also give you a deeper understanding and a =
truthful light on the situation.

and pull-back preserving functors (*) without even thinking in =
introducing a choice of pullbacks, and when it comes to fibrations, feel =
the need to introduce and work with cleavages.
>=20
> (*) for example even when dealing with the category of sets (or =
categories whose objects have an underlying set), which are plenty of =
choices of pull-backs, for example, inverse image of a subset, the =
standard construction as a subset of the set of pairs, etc. We precisely =
teach in category theory courses that you should not work with any =
particular choice between the choices.
>=20
> We all agree that it is neither necessary not good to choose a choice =
between all possible choices. This is precisely the progress that =
represents category theory thinking over set theory thinking. See for =
example, in the dawn of category theory, the considerations of Mac Lane =
concerning the fact that a quotient of a quotient of a group is not a =
quotient (as it is still now taught in algebra courses, category theory =
thinking has not arrived there yet).
>=20
> You may say that the choice of a cleavage is at a different level than =
all this, but, essentially, deep down, for me it is the same. There is =
an old way of thinking (as Grothendieck said, SLN224, page 193) that =
hesitates in face of fibrations and prefer to work with a chosen =
cleavage.
