Ever since Eckmann-Hilton, and perhaps even before, the notion of an
object G in one category X bearing the structure of an object in some
concrete other category A (concrete via U: A -> Sets, say) has been =

clearly and unambiguously expressed as follows:

The hom functor X(-, G): X^op -> Sets is given a factorization thru' U.

If both X and A are concrete, it's perfectly plausible for an object
of X to bear the structure of an object in A, and vice versa, and a
brief peek at the example of 2 as BA w/ KT_2-space structure and as
KT_2-space with BA structure will make short work of understanding how
an object may be thought of as "inhabiting both categories at once":
indeed, it's that contravariant adjoint pair alone, between A and X,
that provides the duality in John Isbell's 1972 approach, where =

at most one of A and X need be concrete.

HTH. Cheers, -- Fred
