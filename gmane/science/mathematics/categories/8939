Researchers interested in research in computational logic are=20
invited to attend the 2016 Autumn School. The 2-day school is=20
suited for those who wish to learn advanced topics in computational=20
logic and logic programming. It will consist of four half-day=20
tutorials on the following topics:

1. Constraint Logic Programming
       Lecturer: Roman Bartak, Charles University, Czech Republic

2. Language processing through logic grammars and constraints
       Lecturer: Veronica Dahl, Simon Fraser University, Canada

3. Answer Set Programming: foundations and applications
       Lecturer: Torsten Schaub, University of Potsdam, Germany

4. Verification and probabilistic programming
       Lecturer: C.R. Ramakrishnan, SUNY Stony Brook, USA

A number of scholarships for students that cover local expenses for the=20
duration of the school are available. To apply for these scholarships,=20
students should also register to the Doctoral Consortium and send the=20
following information to German Vidal at gvidal@dsic.upv.es by July 24th:
- A short vita of the applicant.
- A letter of recommendation from applicant's faculty advisor.
- A one paragraph statement outlining how the school will benefit the appli=
cant.
The letter from the advisor should also certify that the applicant is a=20
full-time student.
