This may depend on what exactly one understands under "state sum models".

The Fukuma-Hosono-Kawai construction of 2d TQFTs from semisimple
algebras has tradionally been called a state sum model description.
Lauda and Pfeiffer have described it at great length in

Lauda-Pfeiffer
State sum construction of two-dimensional open-closed Topological
Quantum Field Theories
http://arxiv.org/abs/math.QA/0602047

When one internalizes these constructions from Vect into a modular
tensor category, one obtains the state-sum-like  construction of 2d
CFT by Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert, a review of which is for instance here

I. Runkel, J. Fjelstad, J. Fuchs, Ch. Schweigert
Topological and conformal field theory as Frobenius algebras
math.CT/0512076.

The Turaev-Viro model for 3d TQFT is also frequently called state sum
model. I don't find the good review of Turaev-Viro that I wanted to
link to right this moment, but googling shows up lots or useful links,
it seems.
