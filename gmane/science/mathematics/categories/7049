There's a logical morphism from the topos of sets to the topos of =
G-sets, so the internal logics of their ZF-parts (built by iterating the =
power set operation starting from the empty set) look the same.  As a =
first step toward symmetric models, you want (whether or not the group G =
is large) to form the topos of continuous G-sets for some group topology =
on G (where the sets on which G acts are given the discrete topology).  =
The ZF part of the resulting topos is still logically equivalent to the =
original universe of sets.  But, at least in the case of small G the =
topos may also contain objects A such that, if you iterate power set =
starting with A (instead of the empty set), then new phenomena, =
including violations of choice, can appear.  (I haven't checked what =
happens with large G; the problem is that A might then also be large and =
thus not in your topos; whether this problem actually arises may depend =
on the topology you put on G.)  This power-set iteration over A produces =
a model of the variant of ZF that allows atoms (=3D urelements), and the =
violations of choice you get this way amount to those that set-theorists =
get in Fraenkel-Mostoski-Specker style permutation models.

To get to ZF (without atoms) and the symmetric models you asked about, a =
further step is needed, namely to force over the topos of continuous =
G-sets to produce an A-indexed family of pure sets (i.e., sets that =
don't involve atoms from A).  That forcing can move the choice-violating =
features of A (and iterated power sets over it) into the ZF-part of the =
topos (without atoms).  The models you get this way are essentially the =
same as symmetric submodels of forcing extensions, and that's covered in =
considerable detail in my memoir with Andre Scedrov. =20
