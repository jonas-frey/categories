24th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2012
August 6-17, 2012
Opole, Poland
http://www.esslli2012.pl
Call for Course and Workshop Proposals
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI) is
organized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and Information
(FoLLI, http://www.folli.org/) in different sites around Europe. The main
focus of
ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics, logic and computer science.
ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as well as
workshops, covering a wide variety of topics within or around the three mai=
n
areas
of interest: Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic and
Computation. Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attractin=
g
up
to 500 students from Europe and elsewhere. The school has developed into an
important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and
researchers
interested in the interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and
Information. For
more information, visit the FoLLI website, as well as the ESSLLI 2011
website:
http://esslli2011.ijs.si/.


CALL FOR COURSE AND WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

The ESSLLI 2012 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational,
introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the 24th annual
Summer School on important topics of active research in the broad
interdisciplinary
area connecting logic, linguistics, computer science and the cognitive
sciences.

All proposals should be submitted via the EasyChair system, using a
prescribed
form that is available on the ESSLLI 2012 website, no later than:

June 19, 2011 (extended)

Authors of proposals will be notified of the committee's decision by
September 15,
2011.


GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION

Proposers of courses and workshops should follow the guidelines below while
preparing their submissions; proposals that do not conform with these
guidelines
may not be considered.

Courses are taught by 1 or max. 2 lecturers, and workshops are organized by
1 or
max. 2 organizers. Lecturers and organizers must have obtained a Ph.D. or a=
n
equivalent degree at the time of the submission deadline. Courses and
workshops
run over one week (Monday-Friday) and consist of five 90-minute sessions.
Lecturers who want to offer a long, two-week course should submit two
independent one-week courses (for example, an introductory course in the
first
week and an advance course in the second). The ESSLLI program committee has
the right to select only one of the two proposed courses.


FOUNDATIONAL COURSES

These are strictly elementary courses not assuming any background knowledge=
.
They are intended for people who wish to get acquainted with the problems
and
techniques of areas new to them. Ideally, they should allow researchers fro=
m
other
fields to acquire the key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus
encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary research community=
.
Foundational courses should have no special prerequisites, but may
presuppose
some experience with scientific methods and general appreciation of the
field of
the course.


INTRODUCTORY COURSES

Introductory courses are central to the activities of the Summer School.
They are
intended to provide an introduction to the (interdisciplinary) field for
students,
young researchers, and other non-specialists, and to equip them with a good
understanding of the field's basic methods and techniques. Such courses
should
enable experienced researchers from other fields to acquire the key
competencies
of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly
interdisciplinary research community. Introductory courses in a topic at th=
e
interface of two fields can build on some knowledge of the component fields=
;
e.g.,
an introductory course in computational linguistics should address an
audience
which is familiar with the basics of linguistics and computation. Proposals
for
introductory courses should indicate the level of the course as compared to
standard texts in the area (if available).


ADVANCED COURSES

Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of advanced Masters or
Ph.D.
students. Proposals for advanced courses should specify the prerequisites i=
n
detail.


TIMETABLE FOR COURSE PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:
Jun 19, 2011: Proposal Submission Deadline
Sep 15, 2011: Notification Deadline
Jun 1, 2012: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material by the
ESSLLI
2012 local organizers


WORKSHOPS

The aim of the workshops is to provide a forum for advanced Ph.D. students
and
other researchers to present and discuss their work. Workshops should have =
a
well-defined theme, and workshop organizers should be specialists in the
theme of
the workshop. The proposals for workshops should justify the choice of
topic, give
an estimate of the number of attendants and expected submissions, and
provide a
list of at least 15 potential submitters working in the field of the
workshop. The
organizers are required to give a general introduction to the theme during
the first
session of the workshop. They are also responsible for various
organizational
matters, including soliciting submissions, reviewing, drawing up the
program,
taking care of expenses of invited speakers, etc. In particular, each
workshop
organizer will be responsible for sending out a Call for Papers for the
workshop
and to organize the selection of the submissions by the deadlines specified
below.
The call for workshop submissions must make it clear that the workshop is
open to
all members of the ESSLLI community and should indicate that all workshop
contributors must register for the Summer School.

TIMETABLE FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS:
Jun 19, 2011: Proposal Submission Deadline
Sep 15, 2011: Notification Deadline
Oct 15, 2011: Deadline for submission of the Calls for Papers to ESSLLI 201=

Apr 15, 2012: Suggested deadline for notification of workshop contributors
Jun 1, 2012: Deadline for submission of camera-ready copy of workshop
proceedings to the ESSLLI 2012 Local Organizers.

Workshop speakers will be required to register for the Summer School;
however,
they will be able to register at a reduced rate to be determined by the
Local Organizers.


FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS

Forms for submitting course and workshop proposals are available on the
ESSLLI 2012 website.

The proposers are required to submit the following information:

* Contact address and fax number
* Name, email, affiliation, homepage of each lecturer / workshop organizer
(at most
two per course or workshop)
* Title of proposed course/workshop
* Abstract (abstract of the proposal, max 150 words)
* Type (workshop, foundational, introductory, or advanced course)
* Areas (one or more of: Computation, Language, Logic, or Other)
* Description (describe the proposed contents of the course and substantiat=
e
timeliness and relevance to ESSLLI in at most one A4 page)
* Tentative outline of the course / expected participation in the workshop
* External funding (whether the proposers will be able to obtain external
funding for
travel and accommodation expenses)
* Further particulars (e.g., course prerequisites, previous teaching
experiences, etc.)


FINANCIAL ASPECTS

Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers should be aware that all
teaching
and organizing at the summer schools is done on a voluntary basis in order
to keep
the participants' fees as low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not
paid for
their contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation expense=
s
(up
to fixed maximum amounts, which will be communicated to the lecturers upon
notification). Lecturers and workshop organizers will have their
registration fee
waived. In case a course or workshop is to be taught/organized by two
people, a
lump sum will be reimbursed to cover travel and accommodation expenses for
one
of them; the splitting of the sum is up to the lecturers/organizers. It
should be
stressed that while proposals from all over the world are welcome, the
School
cannot guarantee full reimbursement of travel costs, especially if lecturer=
s
or
organizers have to come from outside of Europe.

The local organizers would highly appreciate it if, whenever possible,
lecturers and
workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover travel and
accommodation
expenses, as that would help us keep the cost of attending ESSLLI 2012
lower.

<br>FINANCIAL ASPECTS<br><br>Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers =
should be aware that all teaching<br>and organizing at the summer schools i=
s done on a voluntary basis in order to keep<br>the participants&#39; fees =
as low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not paid for<br>
their contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation expense=
s (up<br>to fixed maximum amounts, which will be communicated to the lectur=
ers upon<br>notification). Lecturers and workshop organizers will have thei=
r registration fee<br>
waived. In case a course or workshop is to be taught/organized by two peopl=
e, a<br>lump sum will be reimbursed to cover travel and accommodation expen=
ses for one<br>of them; the splitting of the sum is up to the lecturers/org=
anizers. It should be<br>
stressed that while proposals from all over the world are welcome, the Scho=
ol<br>cannot guarantee full reimbursement of travel costs, especially if le=
cturers or<br>organizers have to come from outside of Europe.<br><br>The lo=
cal organizers would highly appreciate it if, whenever possible, lecturers =
and<br>
workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover travel and accommodat=
ion<br>expenses, as that would help us keep the cost of attending ESSLLI 20=
