FLoC 2018 =E2=80=94 The 2018 Federated Logic Conference
6-19 July 2018
Oxford, England UK
http://www.floc2018.org/


In 1996, as part of its Special Year on Logic and Algorithms, DIMACS
hosted the first Federated Logic Conference (FLoC). It was modelled
after the successful Federated Computer Research Conference (FCRC),
and synergetically brought together conferences that apply logic to
computer science.

The seventh Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'18) will be held in
Oxford, UK, in July 2018, at the Mathematical Institute and the
Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford. FLoC 2018
brings together nine major international conferences related to
mathematical logic and computer science:


International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV)
http://cavconference.org/2018/

IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF)
http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/cas.cremers/csf2018/

International Symposium on Formal Methods (FM)
http://www.fm2018.org

International Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and
Deduction (FSCD)
http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/fscd2018/

International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP)
https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/ALP/iclp2018/

International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR)
http://ijcar2018.org

International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP)
https://itp2018.inria.fr

Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)
http://lics.siglog.org/lics18/

International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability
Testing (SAT)
http://sat2018.azurewebsites.net/


Please refer to the individual websites for conference-specific Calls
for Papers, deadlines and information on how to submit.

In addition to conferences, FLoC 2018 will also feature 79 workshops
(7-8 July, 13 July, and 18-19 July) and the School on Foundations of
Programming and Software Systems (FoPSS, 30 June =E2=80=93 6 July).

The list of workshops can be found at http://www.floc2018.org/workshops.
A separate call for workshop papers will follow in February 2018.
