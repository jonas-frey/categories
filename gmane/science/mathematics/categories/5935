  The Category Theory "Octoberfest" is an annual workshop, traditionally
  held in October, bringing together researchers in category theory and
  its applications.

  This year's meeting will be hosted in the Department of Mathematics
  and Statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.

  There will be an informal welcome reception in the evening of October
  22. The scientific program starts on October 23, and consists of one
  and a half days of research talks.

Research talks

  selinger@mathstat.dal.ca by October 1. Time slots are limited, so
  please register early if you would like to be considered for a talk.

Student support

  We encourage graduate student participation at the workshop. Students
  will pay a reduced registration fee. We will also be able to provide
  limited financial support; if you are interested in this, please
