Suppose I have a well-founded poset W, regarded as a category, and I
would like to define a functor W -> C into some other category by
well-founded recursion.  Is there written out anywhere in the
literature a general schema for doing this?  It's a little more subtle
than defining an ordinary function by well-founded recursion, since we
have to define the value of the functor on morphisms too, and its
value at a given object may depend on its value at morphisms between
previous objects.
