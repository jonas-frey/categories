Woke up in the middle of the night and realized I said
something obviously wrong.  (Not the first time, and
won't be the last, I'm afraid.)

Well, it is true that the stable elements of C form the completion of
F.  And, every element of C is a sup of elements of F, so C is atomless
in the sense of having no minimal non-zero elements.  And, the stables
of C form an atomless cBa.  BUT -- and here is my oversight -- C does
have gaps, and so the cHa is NOT fully non-atomic.

Think of the Cantor set as a subspace T of the unit interval.  There
is a blank from 1/3 to 2/3, if we make the construction via the
middle-third process.  This means that [0,1/3) meet T is open in T,
but [0,1/3] meet T = [0,2/3) meet T is both open and closed.  This
gives a gap between two opens in the cHa C.  So C is not fully gapless.
This gap also exists in the subalgebra A of arithmetically definable
opens.   Aarrgghh.

Is there a fix?  Can we take a quotient in the category of Ha's that
closes the gaps?  Maybe, and maybe not.  In countable Ba's, dividing
by the ideal generated by the atoms can result in a quotient algebra
that still has atoms.   Aarrgghh!

I will have to think further.  Rats!
