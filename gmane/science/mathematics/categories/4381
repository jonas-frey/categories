ATMCS III
Algebraic Topological Methods in Computer Science
Paris, France 7-11 July 2008
http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~sanjeevi/atmcs/
(poster available for download here)

***SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS***
(New) deadline for abstract submissions: 22 May 2008
Notification of acceptance: 5 June 2008
Deadline for registration: 15 June 2008
Conference: 7-11 July 2008
contact information: atmcs08@lix.polytechnique.fr

Recent research has shown that techniques from algebraic topology
adapt strikingly well in studying computational systems and other
subjects within Computer Science. This third ATMCS conference hopes
to bring together researchers employing geometric/topological methods
in both abstract and concrete areas of computer science. The week-long
conference will feature some invited talks, several accepted talks, a
poster session, and countless opportunities for informal
collaboration; we plan to publish our proceedings in a refereed
journal, pending approval. All authors submitting an abstract by the
deadline will have an opportunity, at the least, to present a
(refereed) poster at the poster session.

***SCOPE***
Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, concurrency theory,
distributed computing and complexity, rewriting systems, image
analysis, and sensor networks.

***INVITED SPEAKERS***
A current (and incomplete) list of plenary speakers includes:

John Baez, University of California Riverside, U.S.A.
Gunnar Carlsson, Stanford University, U.S.A.
Herbert Edelsbrunner, Duke University, U.S.A.
Robin Forman, Rice University, U.S.A.

***INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSIONS***
Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts summarizing current
work that explores connections between algebraic topology and computer
science. All abstracts should be written in English and should not
exceed 1 single-spaced page. Although abstracts preferrably should be
submitted at http://atlas-conferences.com/cgi-bin/abstract/submit/caxd-01,
abstracts also can be emailed to atmcs08@lix.polytechnique.fr or mailed
to the following postal address:
