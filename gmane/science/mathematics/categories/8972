CALL FOR PAPERS=0A=
=0A=
Thirty-Second Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on=0A=
LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (LICS)=0A=
=0A=
20-23 June 2017, Reykjavik, Iceland=0A=
=0A=
http://lics.rwth-aachen.de/lics17/=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
SCOPE=0A=
=0A=
The LICS Symposium is an annual international forum on theoretical and prac=
tical topics in computer science that relate to logic, broadly construed. W=
e invite submissions on topics that fit under that rubric. =0A=
=0A=
Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest include: automata theory, =
automated deduction, categorical models and logics, concurrency and distrib=
uted computation, constraint programming, constructive mathematics, databas=
e theory, decision procedures, description logics, domain theory, finite mo=
del theory, formal aspects of program analysis, formal methods, foundations=
  of computability, games and logic, higher-order logic, lambda and combinat=
ory calculi, linear logic, logic in artificial intelligence, logic programm=
ing, logical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational co=
mplexity, logical aspects of quantum computation, logical frameworks, logic=
s of programs, modal and temporal logics, model checking, probabilistic sys=
tems, process calculi, programming language semantics, proof theory, real-t=
ime systems, reasoning about security and privacy, rewriting, type systems =
and type theory, and verification.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
IMPORTANT DATES=0A=
=0A=
Authors are required to submit a paper title and a short abstract of about =
100 words in advance of submitting the extended abstract of the paper. The =
exact deadline time on these dates is given by anywhere on earth (AoE).=0A=
=0A=
Titles and Short Abstracts Due:      3 January 2017=0A=
Full Papers Due:                     9 January 2017=0A=
Author Feedback/Rebuttal Period:     28 Feb - 4 March 2017=0A=
Author Notification:                 21 March 2017=0A=
Final Versions Due for Proceedings:  18 April 2017=0A=
=0A=
Deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be considered. All=0A=
submissions will be electronic via=0A=
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlics2017.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS=0A=
=0A=
Every extended abstract must be submitted in the IEEE Proceedings 2-column =
10pt format and may be at most 12 pages, including references. LaTeX style =
files are available on the conference website; please use IEEEtran.cls vers=
ion V1.8b, released on 26/08/2015.=0A=
=0A=
The extended abstract must be in English and provide sufficient detail to a=
llow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper. It should beg=
in with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the main results, =
and a brief explanation of their significance and relevance to the conferen=
ce and to computer science, all phrased for the non-specialist. Technical d=
evelopment directed to the specialist should follow. References and compari=
sons with related work must be included. (If necessary, detailed proofs of =
technical results may be included in a clearly-labeled appendix, to be cons=
ulted at the discretion of program committee members.) Submissions not conf=
orming to the above requirements will be rejected without further considera=
tion. Paper selection will be merit-based, with no a priori limit on the nu=
mber of accepted papers. Papers authored or co-authored by members of the p=
rogram committee are not allowed.=0A=
=0A=
Results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, in=
cluding the proceedings of other symposia or workshops. The program chair m=
ust be informed, in advance of submission, of any closely related work subm=
itted or about to be submitted to a conference or journal. Authors of accep=
ted papers are expected to sign copyright release forms. One author of each=
  accepted paper is expected to present it at the conference. =0A=
=0A=
=0A=
SHORT PRESENTATIONS=0A=
=0A=
A session of short presentations, intended for descriptions of student rese=
arch, works in progress, and other brief communications, is planned. These =
abstracts will not be published. Dates and guidelines will be posted on the=
  conference website. =0A=
=0A=
=0A=
KLEENE AWARD FOR BEST STUDENT PAPER=0A=
=0A=
An award in honour of the late Stephen C. Kleene will be given for the best=
  student paper(s), as judged by the program committee. The 2017 edition of =
the award is sponsored by the European Association for Theoretical Computer=
  Science (EATCS). =0A=
=0A=
=0A=
SPECIAL ISSUES=0A=
=0A=
Full versions of up to three accepted papers, to be selected by the program=
  committee, will be invited for submission to the Journal of the ACM. Addit=
ional selected papers will be invited to a special issue of Logical Methods=
  in Computer Science. =
