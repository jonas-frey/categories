no, the existential quantifier has its standard (categorical)
interpretation (direct image), not the "constructive" one from type
theory.  We do not reinterpret replacement/collection either -- they
have their usual interpretation.

What is a bit delicate is the background category of classes in which
the (set-theoretically) unbounded quantifiers are interpreted.
