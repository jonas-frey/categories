Dear Paul,

In my now obsolete 1966 thesis, the context was that of a category with
finite limits and finite coproducts, but I had not assumed therein that
coproducts should be disjoint and universal. With these assumptions, the
definitions of `abstractly unary' for arbitrary binary products (factors
through AT LEAST one of the injections) and of `abstractly exclusively
unary' (factors through exactly one of the injections) are equivalent by
the disjointness part, and are equivalent also to the same notions with
binary coproducts of 1 instead of arbitrary binary coproducts (by the
universal or stability part). So, *any* of those in this context should
mean `connected'.  Without those conditions, but with just a terminal
object and binary coproducts, then the `at least' part does not reduce to
that of coproducts of 1, but the `at most' part does. In that case, the
notions correspond to `abstractly unary' and `abstractly exclusively
unary', and they are not equivalent. So it all depends on the ambient
category.

I still have to digest your disquisitions on constructive analysis, which
seem most interesting, but on the above point, I emphasize that inded one
must keep the disctinction between connectedness wirt binary coproducts and
connectedness wrt arbitrary coproducts (indexed externally, e.g. by a set in
a Grothendieck topos E-->SET, or by an object of S in the cae of a bounded
topos E-->S. Whether the terminology must make that distinction I am not
sure of, or maybe we could say `connected' for the binary case (which is
also intrinsic), and `S-connected' for the case of S-indexed coproducts.
Once again, under enough hypotheses as I szaid above and was also mentioned
by Steve Lack.

I am not sure of which hypotheses Vaughan wants to make but, if the minimal
possible, then he might need the detailed analysis that I proposed and, in
that case, reserve `connected' in the binary case for `abstractly
exclusively unary', not simply `abstractly unary', and `connected' when only
the binary coproduct considered is 1+1. But if his categories ae categories
of graphs, I don't see his problem.


With best regards,
Marta
