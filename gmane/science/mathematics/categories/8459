******************************************************************
***                          PhD Position
***
***             Categories, Coalgebras and Types

******************************************************************

Applications are invited for PhD study under the supervision of Prof Neil G=
hani and Dr Conor McBride on any of the following topics

     * Dependently Typed Programming

     * Homotopy Type Theory

     * Coalgebra

     * Category Theory in Computer Science

The position is fully funded for EU students (apologies to non EU-citizens =
for this ridiculous piece of non-meritocracy) and will last for 3 years.The=
  applicant's motivation must centre  on a desire for beautiful mathematics =
of lasting value. The applicant should also have an innate sense of the won=
der of learning allied to the capacity to work hard and achieve their goals=
.

The Mathematically Structured Programming Group's vision is to use mathemat=
ics to understand the nature of computation, and to then turn that understa=
nding into the next generation of programming languages. This reflects the =
symbiotic relationship between mathematics, programming, and the design of =
programming languages --- any attempt to sever this connection will diminis=
h each component. In order to achieve these research goals we mainly use id=
eas from category theory, type theory and functional programming. Besides P=
rofessor Neil Ghani and Dr Conor McBride, the group consists of a number of=
  internationally leading researchers including Dr Clemens Kupke, Dr Ross Du=
ncan, Dr Robert Atkey and Dr Fredrick Norvall-Forsberg as well as a number =
of PhD students.

So, if you are interested in Neil-and-Conor studies, please contact us. App=
lications will be considered on a first come, first served basis.
