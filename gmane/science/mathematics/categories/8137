I agree with Fred and Marco.=20
Keith Hardie was one of a vanishing breed of true gentlemen.

When I visited Cape Town in the early 1980s, we discovered=20
we had a common interest in diagrams of interlocking sequences
(so called by TCT (Terry) Wall).=20
Keith=92s interlocking sequences arose from homotopy groups,=20
mine from homology.=20
He kept encouraging me until I wrote up a result I had while writing,=20
but did not include in, my thesis.
I really enjoyed revisiting that result and improving some techniques.

That first visit to South Africa and an evening at Keith=92s home left a =
lasting impression on me.=20
We only met a few times after that, the last being CT2009.

It is very sad news, Peter. Please convey my condolences to the family.
