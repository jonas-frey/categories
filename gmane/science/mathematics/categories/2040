That was supposed to be my point.
Just as a group can be described many ways by generators and relations,
so a sketch (if we define a sketch to be an entire category;
apparently that varies) can be described many ways by ideas.
It's the category that truly characterises what a monoid is
(in the given doctrine), so it better deserves the name "idea",
if we're trying to hark back to Plato-n (even just to be cute).
(Whether or not it's too late to change, I can't say.)

2 indices and 0 indices.  *Gulp*  You're right!
I always felt annoyed having to write in that nullary axiom; now I know why.

I suppose that you're aware of this, but note that we need to allow
nodes that don't branch but also aren't labelled (considered leaves),
which is where we place [].  For example, the tree

m           .
 \         /
   \     /
     \./

indicates the product [m[]]; that it equals m is the right unit law.
This threw me for a moment, since [] seemed at first to have disappeared.

We could also go straight to trees and define them as the basic operations,
then requiring as axiom that grafting of trees produces the same result
as composing the operations.

If we were defining a nonassociative operation without identity,
then we could denote the basic operations by *binary* trees.

The nullary counterpart is grafting 0 trees to get the tree m.

Well, I managed to introduce grafting back before the categorification!
Aren't I clever?  Too clever for my own good?  ^_^

As long as we learn the lesson that binary operations
warrant a search for their nullary partners,
then we've done the important thing, at least,
even if we miss out on some ever more complicated elegance.
