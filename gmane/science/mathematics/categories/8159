Abstract:
Given a monad T on a suitable enriched category B equipped with a proper
factorization system (E,M), we define notions of T-completion, T-closure,
and T-density.  We show that not only the familiar notions of completion,
closure, and density in normed vector spaces, but also the notions of
sheafification, closure, and density with respect to a Lawvere-Tierney
topology, are instances of the given abstract notions.  The process of
T-completion is equally the enriched idempotent monad associated to T
(which we call the idempotent core of T), and we show that it exists as
soon as every morphism in B factors as a T-dense morphism followed by a
T-closed M-embedding.  The latter hypothesis is satisfied as soon as B has
certain pullbacks as well as wide intersections of M-embeddings.  Hence
the resulting theorem on the existence of the idempotent core of an
enriched monad entails Fakir's existence result in the non-enriched case,
as well as adjoint functor factorization results of Applegate-Tierney and
Day.
