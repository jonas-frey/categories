 	One basic intuition is that=20
 				cubes are products.
 	Yet almost none of the combinatorial toposes commonly called
 	=E2=80=9Ccubical sets=E2=80=9D have that feature.  Is there some profound =
disadvantage
 	in allowing projection maps to have their universal property (yielding
 	diagonal maps, etc)? If so, I have never seen it spelled out.
=09
 	An advantage to having finite products in a site is that the (iterated)
 	pathspace functor has a right adjoint, leading to a very natural construct=
ion of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces.

 	Dan Kan told me that the reason for his switch was that cubical groups do =
not have the extension property (i.e., the Kan property), as simplicial gro=
ups do.=20
 	But later I realized that there is ambiguity about what =E2=80=9Ccubical=
=E2=80=9D means.

 	Since these combinatorial categories are usually toposes, some light is sh=
ed on their particularity by determining what kind of structure they classi=
fy=20
(in the established categorical sense, e.g.,the simplicial topos classifies=
  total orders with distinct endpoints, and a simple cubical example classif=
ies
  strictly bipointed objects). Concretely, there are many different theories=
  of algebraic 	structure for which the unit interval is a model, and having=
  chosen one,
this structure should be preserved by geometric realization.
