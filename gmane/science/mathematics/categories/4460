current research strengths in applied mathematics, analysis, category =20=

theory and number theory.  Areas of applied mathematics and/or =20
analysis are strongly preferred.  The appointee will teach a wide =20
range of mathematics courses and supervise research projects in the =20
Department=92s undergraduate and postgraduate programs.  The Department =20=

seeks applicants with proven research skills, a commitment to =20
teaching and developing courses of the highest standard and a =20
willingness to work with colleagues on new initiatives in the Faculty =20=

member of a group, together with an outline of a coherent plan for =20
future research); interest in developing research links within, and =20
outside, the University (particular plans to develop cross-=20
disciplinary links within the University, research links with =20
external institutions or industry research collaborations should be =20
indicated); interest and ability to teach undergraduate mathematics =20
across the full range of service and specialised courses (as =20
demonstrated by documented experience in tutoring, lecturing or =20
workshop presentation); well-developed interpersonal, written =20
communication skills.

Desirable Selection Criteria:  Research background in applied =20
mathematics or analysis particularly in one of the following areas: =20
(i) analytical-numeral techniques in wave diffraction and/or interest =20=

in applications to acoustic or electromagnetic waves, (ii) =20
applications of non-linear dynamical systems especially in electronic =20=

and physical systems, (iii) harmonic analysis and partial =20
differential equations involving the theory of singular integrals or =20
related topics; experience in industry-collaborative research or =20
experience of active participation in  an extensive national/=20
international research collaboration; established international =20
recognition (as demonstrated by publications, research grants, =20
citations or invited conference presentations); substantial =20
university-level teaching experience in mathematics across the full =20
range of service and specialised courses.

Enquiries:  Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact Professor =20
Paul Smith on +61-2-9850-8944 or e-mail pdsmith@maths.mq.edu.au
