There's a certain tension between logic and algebra here.  The
algebraist's response to a question of this nature should be, adjunction
is third-order equality, where isomorphism is second-order and
commutative diagrams are first-order.

The adjunction case is best understood 3-categorically, representable
quite easily with origami.  I can't find the origami I constructed to
demonstrate this, I should build it again and post a photo of it at some
point.

Using adjunctions to explain equality is fine, just as using a hammer
two sizes too large to crack a peanut works fine when wielded gently, as
Andy has done here.
