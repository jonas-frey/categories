SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on Semantic Spaces at the Intersection of NLP, Physics, and =
Cognitive Sciences

https://sites.google.com/view/semspace2020/home =
<https://sites.google.com/view/semspace2020/home> =20

August 8th and 9th 2020
Utrecht, The Netherlands
(dates and location subject to confirmation)

****
COVID-19 UPDATE
We will be going ahead with the workshop, either in an online format or =
in person if the situation allows.
Since ESSLLI 2020 has been cancelled, the dates and location may be =
subject to slight change.

IMPORTANT DATES:
Paper submission: 24th April 2020
Notification to contributors: 1st June 2020
Workshop dates: 8th-9th August 2020 (subject to confirmation)

AIMS AND SCOPE
Vector embeddings of word meanings have become a mainstream tool in =
large scale natural language processing tools. The use of vectors to =
represent meanings in semantic spaces or feature spaces is also employed =
in cognitive science. Unrelated to natural language and cognitive =
science, vectors and vector spaces have been extensively used as models =
of physical theories and especially the theory of quantum mechanics. =
Crucial similarities between the vector representations of quantum =
mechanics and those of natural language are exhibited via bicompact =
linear logic and compact closed categorical structures in natural =
language.

Exploiting the common ground provided by vector spaces, the proposed =
workshop will bring together researchers working at the intersection of =
NLP, cognitive science, and physics, offering to them an appropriate =
forum for presenting their uniquely motivated work and ideas. The =
interplay between these three disciplines will foster theoretically =
motivated approaches to understanding how meanings of words interact =
with each other in sentences and discourse via grammatical types, how =
they are determined by input from the world, and how word and sentence =
meanings interact logically.

Topics of interest include (but are not restricted to):
Reasoning in semantic spaces
Compositionality in semantic spaces and conceptual spaces
Conceptual spaces in linguistics and natural language processing
Applications of quantum logic in natural language processing and =
cognitive science
Modelling functional words such as prepositions and relative pronouns in =
compositional distributional models of meaning
Diagrammatic reasoning for natural language processing and cognitive =
science
Modelling so-called =E2=80=98non-compositional=E2=80=99 phenomena such =
as metaphor

SPECIAL SESSION
A special session will address the relevance of formal grammar methods =
in deep learning and other statistical and vector space approaches to =
language. Examples of phenomena where these methods come into play =
include (but of course are not limited to) anaphora resolution, =
long-range filler-gap dependencies, function-argument relations, =
locality domains, and syntactic structures in general.

This session was originally planned to be held jointly with the Formal =
Grammar conference (http://fg.phil.hhu.de/2020/ =
<http://fg.phil.hhu.de/2020/>) which has been cancelled. We welcome =
papers that were submitted for the joint FG/SemSpace session as SemSpace =
submissions under the present CfP.

SUBMISSIONS:=20
Electronic submission of original contributions (up to 16 pages) of =
previously unpublished work. Submission of substantial, albeit partial =
results of work in progress is welcomed.

Extended abstracts (3 pages) of previously published work that is recent =
and relevant to the workshop. These should include a link to a =
separately published paper or preprint.

Contributions should be submitted at:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsemspace2020 =
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsemspace2020>=20
In submitting your abstract, please indicate whether you intend your =
submission for the special session.

A special issue of selected extended papers will be prepared following =
the workshop. Only original contributions will be considered for =
publication.

Please send any queries to semspace2020@easychair.org =
