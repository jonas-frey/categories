[Note from moderator: This may be interesting to some readers, but as 
suggested, is not for further discussion. Thanks, Bob ]

Dear all,

[this is not exactly on-topic, but it impacts us all, and I ask the
moderator to let this through, though not for the purposes of
discussion.]

The below-linked survey is looking for maximum coverage to determine
the attitudes among the mathematical community to publishing in order
to inform developments that will ideally lead to positive changes.

Note that you do not have to have strong views on publishing to fill
it out, the idea is to get an *accurate* view, not just one of the
vocal minority.

Many thanks,

David

Dear colleague: please answer this *anonymous* survey if and only if
you have been involved with a mathematical journal as editor,
reviewer/referee, author or reader in the last 3 years. By
"mathematical" we also mean to include theoretical computer science
journals and disciplinary journals used by applied mathematicians.
Essentially, any journal covered by Mathematical Reviews qualifies.

This survey is run by Mark Wilson (mcw@cs.auckland.ac.nz) on behalf of
an international group of researchers and librarians interested in
improving overall performance of the publication system in mathematics
and other subjects. Its results will be made public later this year.
Our estimate for completion time is 15 minutes.

I've invited you to fill out the form Survey of mathematical
publishing priorities. To fill it out, visit:
