The University of Edinburgh is looking to recruit a full-time postdoctoral
researcher to work on the project "Combining Viewpoints in Quantum Theory"
with Dr. Chris Heunen.

Duration: initially 1 year, with extension to 3 years
Salary: =C2=A333,199 - =C2=A339,609
Start: 1 July 2019 or soon thereafter
Deadline: 17 May 2019
Application:
https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/pls/corehrrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobs=
pec?p_id=3D047668

Applicants must hold or be about to receive a doctoral degree in Computer
Science, Mathematics, or Physics, and have a strong background in one or
more of the following areas:
* Quantum computing
* Category theory
* Programming languages
* Operator algebra
* Causality

The successful applicant will focus on one of two areas: optimising quantum
programs by analysing unitary groups, and implementing the achieved results
in software; or developing a categorical framework for spatially
distributed quantum protocols, and investigating causality. This includes
collaborating with project partners and members, including PhD students.

The Quantum Informatics group (http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/quantum-informatics)
is part of the School of Informatics' Laboratory for the Foundations of
Computer Science, a community of theoretical computer scientists with
interests in concurrency, semantics, categories, algebra, types, logic,
algorithms, complexity, quantum theory, databases and modelling.

Informal enquiries can be directed to <chris.heunen@ed.ac.uk>.
