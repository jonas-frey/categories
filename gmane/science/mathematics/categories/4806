 When I teach limits I call Colin's "test object" a "competitor" to the true
limit, or "pretender to the throne", and describe the universal property as
saying "whatever you can do, I can do better".

This game-theoretic approach to universal properties becomes more
interesting when dealing with n-categorical weak limits: the two players
take turns making moves.  First the proponent picks a cone, then the
challenger picks a cone, then the proponent picks a map between cones, then
the challenger picks a map between cones, then the proponent picks a map
between maps between cones, etc..

This idea is important in opetopic n-categories, and there's also an
omega-categorical version - a nice discussion appears starting at the bottom
of page 32 of this paper by Makkai:

http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/equivalence/equivinpdf/equivalence.pdf

"The Hero has to answer each move of the Challenger [...] If Hero can keep
it up forever, he wins; otherwise he loses."

Best,
