Hi category gurus and categorists

=20

I have many questions about category theory but i start with one.

=20

1>

What are smooth functors and proper functors=2C originating in pursuing sta=
cks?

Both nontechnically and technicaly.

=20

I know they are dual to each other and that they are characterized by cohom=
ological properties

inspired by the proper or smooth base change theorem in algebraic geometry=
=2C but what is the relation?

(I don't know the statement of the theorems)

=20

Finally=2C what are smooth and proper functors good for?

Are smooth and proper functors fibrations and cofibrations or Grothendieck =
fibrations and

Grothendieck op-fibrations in some model categories or derivators?

=20

The only thing i could find about smooth and proper functors on internet is=
