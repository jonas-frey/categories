Concerning Thomas Streicher's question about the internal linear
functional (=distribution of compact support) monad on Froelicher's smooth
category : see volume 1 of the journal Functional Analysis for two papers
by Waelbroeck which show that the algebras are essentially determined by
complete bornological spaces.

Concerning Klaus Keimel's question about "abstract" compact convex sets, I
do not recall a precise reference but is seems that Linton or Semadeni or
both proved that they all do embed in locally convex linear spaces. This
of course is in contrast with the noncompact finitary part of the
probability theory, where there are those special algebras which are often
discarded as spurious, but which in fact by a very natural adjoint to an
algebraic functor record the face structure of any convex set as a
semilattice. That raises the question: is there no equally natural way to
record face structure for COMPACT convex sets ?
