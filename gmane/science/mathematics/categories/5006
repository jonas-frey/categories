I assume you mean to take such pairs (K,f) up to isomorphism, or else,
as Peter Johnstone has already pointed out, your construction will not
be well-defined. For instance, even the finite sets may form a proper
class, depending on your underlying set theory.

In the case where k=omega, T is the well-known finite multiset monad,
which associates to each S the free commutative monoid generated by S
(whose elements are also known as finite multisets in S).

For other k, I would call this the "monad of multisets of size less
than k". I think this works for any infinite small cardinal, not just
regular ones.
