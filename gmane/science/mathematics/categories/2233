Aims and Scope

 Foundations of Global Computing focuses on foundational aspects of
 global computing, and invites submissions of original scientific work
 thereof. A non-exclusive list of topics includes:

    * calculi, models, and semantic theories of concurrent,
      distributed, mobile, global-computing systems;
    * languages, security, types, protocols and algorithms for global
      computing.

 Further points of specific interest are grid computing, peer-to-peer
 systems, game-theoretic approaches, protocol analysis, trust
 management, language-based security, ...

 The workshop proceedings will be published in the ENTCS series and a
 selection of papers will appear in a special issue of a leading
 Computer Science journal. It will be held as a ICALP2003 satellite
 event under the auspices of the EATCS.
