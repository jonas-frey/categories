And that was recording the upshot of work carried out in the course of
a 1969-70 seminar on topos theory held at Dalhousie U. (Halifax, NS), =

during a sort of follow-on to the marvelous Zurich Triples Book year
at the ETH during 1966-67.

Thanks for that Dalhousie year, btw, to Bill Lawvere, Arnold J. Tingley,
and the Izaak Walton Killam Foundation, without whose organizational
efforts, cooperation, and funding, respectively, there'd have been =

no critical mass for that year at all.

Cheers, -- Fred
