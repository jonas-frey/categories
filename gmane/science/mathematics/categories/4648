Just a last minute note for those planning to attend Octoberfest this
weekend (4,5 Oct):

There will be a $20 registration fee - please bring exact change if
possible (we'll take US$ if you haven't managed to convert to the
proper currency).  Students won't be charged registration.

The talks are to be held in room FGB040 of the Faubourg building of
Concordia University, near the corner of Pierce and Ste-Catherine.
(See the maps on the website.)

The first talk is at 9:14, but coffee will be available before.
(We'll have coffee at the site of the talks, but the area in and
around the Faubourg building is crawling with coffee shops, should you
develop cravings.)

Please check the website for all further details (schedule and
abstracts of talks, maps of the area, weather, anticipated
participants, accomodation(!), etc).

If you plan to attend and haven't already emailed me your intentions,
please let me know asap (thanks).  I am assuming most participants are
planning to attend the lunch at a local Indian buffet - let me know
your plans if that is not true in your case, please asap.

See you Saturday,
