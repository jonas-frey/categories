Mike Barr's response to my

was "I don't see your problem."  And now that I reflect on that comment,
I don't see it myself.

With the benefit of sleeping on the problem combined with Mike's prod,
the moral for me is clear.  The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is
incomplete as stated.  It should read as follows.

   Every natural number partitions uniquely as a sum of 1's, and every
   positive integer factors uniquely as a product of primes.

The constructive proof of the theorem exhibits this ostensibly two-part
structure uniformly as the completion under coproducts of the inverted
flat CPO N^*.  This coproduct-complete category is naturally analyzed
into two components, additive upstairs and multiplicative downstairs.
The components share the initial and final objects of the category, with
the former manifesting as 0 in the additive component and 1 in the
multiplicative, and conversely for the latter.

And that's why 0 is at the top of the division lattice.  The reason it
(qua 1) is at the bottom of the additive component and not the top (its
default location in an arbitrary category with 1) is because it
generates Set (or in this case FinSet).

It makes no sense to consider 0 as a prime because there is no way to
define things such that 0 factors uniquely.  The role of the morphisms
in N^* is to prevent 0 from being an atom in the completion, instead
making it final in the inverted CPO, which coproducts preserve and
colimits do not.

Had we completed under colimits, by Yoneda the final object would have
been the constantly 1 functor.  The top * of N^* would then no longer be
the final object of the completion, being the unit functor for *, namely
1 at * and 0 elsewhere.  With either completion the primes are the other
unit functors, but only with the coproduct completion is the final
object a unit functor.
