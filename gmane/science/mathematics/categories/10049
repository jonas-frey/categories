Dear all,

We are extending the submission deadline for the HoTT 2019 proceedings
special issue of MSCS; the new deadline is *Friday 13 December*.

Two notes for submitters:

- If you already submitted for the original deadline but would like to use
the extra time to revise your submission, let us know, and we will hold
back from sending your submission out for refereeing for now.

- There are problems with the MSCS LaTeX class file currently linked in the
author instructions.  Hopefully this should be fixed soon, but for now,
don=E2=80=99t worry about putting submissions into the journal style =E2=80=
=94 this can be
done later after acceptance.

Best wishes,
=E2=80=93Peter and Dan.

Original CfP:

Submissions are now open for a special issue of Mathematical Structures in
Computer Science on the proceedings of the HoTT 2019 conference, edited by
Dan Licata and Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine.

Papers on work presented at the HoTT19 conference are particularly
encouraged, but the special issue is open to any work on homotopy type
theory and related research areas.

Specific topics include but are not limited to: homotopical and
higher-categorical semantics of type theory; synthetic homotopy theory;
applications of univalence and higher inductive types; cubical type
theories and cubical models; formalization of mathematics and computer
science in homotopy type theory / univalent foundations; and new type
theories based on higher-dimensional ideas.

To submit a paper, please follow the general MSCS submission procedure at
https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer=
-science
.
When giving the submission details, select =E2=80=9CHomotopy Type Theory 20=
19=E2=80=9D for
the field =E2=80=9CSpecial Issue=E2=80=9D.
