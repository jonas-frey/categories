Hi, John,

In your Week 240 post to categories, you said

What is unsystematic about the contagious-fixpoint functional?  This is the
functional that maps those functions that have any fixpoints to the identity
function (the function that makes every element a fixpoint) and functions
without fixpoints to themselves (thus preserving the absence of fixpoints).
It's a perfectly good functional that is equally well defined for all sets
X, its statement in no way depends on X, and conceptually the concept of
contagious fixpoints is even intuitively natural, but how do you write it
using the lambda calculus?

Many more examples in this vein at JPAA 128, 33-92 (Pare and Roman, Dinatural
numbers, 1998).  The above is the case K = {0} of Freyd's (proper) class
of examples.

Vaughan
