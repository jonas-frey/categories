    Mario Bunge, the celebrated philosopher and physicist, passed away on =
February 24th.

    His Centenary Festschrift was held a few months ago, in September =
2019.=20
One can have an idea of his deep, astounding production from this =
obituary,=20
by Michael Matthews
-  https://www.hpsst.com/uploads/6/2/9/3/62931075/bunge_obituary.pdf

    With my wife, we remember with great pleasure his company, his =
conversation, his friendship,=20
while he stayed in Genoa with Marta in 1993-94, and more recently a few =
years ago.

Our affection and participation to Marta, Eric and Silvia

Marco and Maria Teresa Grandis
