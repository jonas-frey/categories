It's easy to appreciate their books locally - but I think they
sought a global systematic viewpoint while writing them.

It's possible that a "neo-Bourbaki" should take a less systematic
approach.  Mathematics may be too much in a state of foundational
flux for a systematic approach to be successful right now.  Maybe
the best we can hope for is something a bit more like Wikipedia,
where different people contribute different portions of text, and
they don't cohere in a polished whole.  But presumably anyone calling
for a new Bourbaki wants something different from Wikipedia.

There's "Scholarpedia":

http://www.scholarpedia.org/

but it doesn't seem to be doing anything with math yet, and if
it ever does, I bet it'll take a "midde-of-the-road" approach instead
of pushing a specific intellectual agenda.

I would like to see lots of people try lots of different things.

Best,
