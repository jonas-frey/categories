solutions.  Though elementary in appearance, elliptic curves turn out to=0A=
have a deep structure that makes them endlessly interesting.=0A=

Harris has spent much of his research career in Paris, and it shows:=0A=

Starting with the simple definition of a prime number, he builds, bit by=0A=

conjecture=3DE2=3D80=3D94which, at a press conference given in Paris in the=

rewarded by a million-dollar prize.  The book takes an intimate look at=0A=
the deepest developments in contemporary mathematics, especially the=0A=
visionary work of the recently deceased Alexander Grothendieck.  And it=0A=
successfully conveys what Harris calls the =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cpathos=3DE2=3D80=
=3D9D of the=0A=
mathematician=3DE2=3D80=3D99s calling.=0A=
=0A=
Harris is rudely skeptical of the usual justifications for pure=0A=
mathematics:  that it is beautiful, true, or even much good, at least in=0A=
the utilitarian =3DE2=3D80=3D9CGolden Goose=3DE2=3D80=3D9D sense. =3DE2=3D8=

cryptography, by making the world safe for Amazon, has destroyed the=0A=
corner bookstore (in America, not France, where online retailers are=0A=
prohibited by law from offering free shipping on discounted books).  And=0A=

Nor is Harris impressed with the claim, voiced by Hardy and so many=0A=
others, that pure mathematics is justified by its beauty.  When=0A=
mathematicians talk about beauty, he tells us, what they really mean is=0A=
pleasure. =3DE2=3D80=3D9COutside this relaxed field, it=3DE2=3D80=3D99s con=

ister =3D=0A=
asked=0A=
me that question,=3DE2=3D80=3D9D Harris writes,=0A=
=0A=
     I could claim that mathematicians, like other academics, are needed=0A=
in the universities to teach a specific population of students the=0A=
skills needed for the development of a technological society and to keep=0A=
a somewhat broader population of students occupied with courses that=0A=
serve to crush the dreams of superfluous applicants to particularly=0A=
desirable professions (as freshman calculus used to be a formal=0A=
requirement to enter medical school in the United States).=0A=
=0A=
Although physicians don=3DE2=3D80=3D99t really need calculus, Harris at lea=
st con=3D=0A=

that engineers, economists, and inventory managers couldn=3DE2=3D80=3D99t g=
et by=0A=
without a fair amount of math, even if it is trivial math by his lights.=0A=
=0A=
Finally, there is the presumed value of mathematical truth.  Since the=0A=
ancient Greeks, mathematics has been taken as a paradigm of knowledge:=0A=
certain, timeless, necessary.  But knowledge of what?  Do the truths=0A=
discovered by mathematics describe an eternal and otherworldly realm of=0A=
objects=3DE2=3D80=3D94perfect circles and so forth=3DE2=3D80=3D94that exist=
  quite indep=3D=0A=
endently of=0A=
the mathematicians who contemplate them?  Or are mathematical objects=0A=
actually human constructions, existing only in our minds?  Or, more=0A=
radically still, could it be that pure mathematics doesn=3DE2=3D80=3D99t re=
ally=0A=
describe any objects at all, that it is just an elaborate game of formal=0A=
symbols played with pencil and paper?=0A=
=0A=
The question of what mathematics is really about is one that continues=0A=
to vex philosophers, but it does not much worry Harris.  Philosophers=0A=
who concern themselves with the problems of mathematical existence and=0A=
truth, he claims, typically pay little attention to what mathematicians=0A=
actually do.  He invidiously contrasts what he calls =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cphiloso=
phy of=0A=
Mathematics=3DE2=3D80=3D9D (with a capital M)=3DE2=3D80=3D94=3DE2=3D80=3D9C=

cal subject invented=0A=
by philosophers=3DE2=3D80=3D9D=3DE2=3D80=3D94with =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cphilosophy=
  of (small-m) math=3D=0A=
ematics,=3DE2=3D80=3D9D which takes=0A=
as its starting point not a priori questions about epistemology and=0A=
ontology, but rather the activity of working mathematicians.=0A=
=0A=
Here, Harris is being a little unfair.  He fails to remark that the=0A=
standard competing positions in the philosophy of mathematics were=0A=
originally staked out not by philosophers, but by mathematicians=3DE2=3D80=
=3D94in=3D=0A=
deed,=0A=
some of the greatest of the last century.  It was David Hilbert=3DE2=3D80=
=3D94a=0A=
=3DE2=3D80=3D9Csupergiant,=3DE2=3D80=3D9D in Harris=3DE2=3D80=3D99s estimat=

iginated =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cformalism,=3DE2=3D80=3D9D which=0A=
views higher mathematics as a game played with formal symbols.  Henri=0A=
Poincar=3DC3=3DA9 (another =3DE2=3D80=3D9Csupergiant=3DE2=3D80=3D9D), Herma=
nn Weyl, and L.E=3D=0A=
.J.  Brouwer were=0A=
behind =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cintuitionism,=3DE2=3D80=3D9D according to which numbe=
rs and other=3D=0A=
  mathematical=0A=
objects are mind-dependent constructions.  Bertrand Russell and Alfred=0A=
North Whitehead took the position known as =3DE2=3D80=3D9Clogicism,=3DE2=3D=
80=3D9D ende=3D=0A=
avoring to=0A=
show in their massive Principia Mathematica that mathematics was really=0A=
logic in disguise.  And =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cplatonism=3DE2=3D80=3D9D=3DE2=3D80=
=3D94the idea that m=3D=0A=
athematics describes=0A=
a perfect and eternal realm of mind-independent objects, like Plato=3DE2=3D=
80=3D=0A=
=3D99s=0A=
world of Forms=3DE2=3D80=3D94was championed by Kurt G=3DC3=3DB6del.=0A=
=0A=
All of these mathematical figures were passionately engaged in what=0A=
Harris slights as philosophy of Mathematics-with-a-capital-M.  The=0A=
debate among them and their partisans was fierce in the 1920s, often=0A=
spilling over into personal animus.  And no wonder:  mathematics at the=0A=
time was undergoing a =3DE2=3D80=3D9Ccrisis=3DE2=3D80=3D9D that had resulte=
d from a ser=3D=0A=
ies of=0A=
confidence-shaking developments, like the emergence of non-Euclidean=0A=
geometries and the discovery of paradoxes in set theory.  If the old=0A=
ideal of certainty was to be salvaged, it was felt, mathematics had to=0A=
be put on a new and secure foundation.  At issue was the very way=0A=
mathematics would be practiced:  what types of proof would be accepted=0A=
as valid, what uses of infinity would be permitted.=0A=
=0A=
For reasons both technical and philosophical, none of the competing=0A=
foundational programs of the early twentieth century proved=0A=
satisfactory.  (G=3DC3=3DB6del=3DE2=3D80=3D99s =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cincompletenes=
s theorems,=3DE2=3D=0A=
=3D80=3D9D in particular,=0A=
created insuperable problems both for Hilbert=3DE2=3D80=3D99s formalism and=
  for=0A=
Russell and Whitehead=3DE2=3D80=3D99s logicism:  they showed=3DE2=3D80=3D94=
roughly spea=3D=0A=
king=3DE2=3D80=3D94that the=0A=
rules of Hilbert=3DE2=3D80=3D99s mathematical =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cgame=3DE2=3D80=
=3D9D could never =3D=0A=
be proved consistent,=0A=
and that a logical system like that of Russell and Whitehead could never=0A=
capture all mathematical truths.)  The issues of mathematical existence=0A=
and truth remain unresolved, and philosophers have continued to grapple=0A=
with them, if inconclusively=3DE2=3D80=3D94as witness the frank title that =
Hilary=0A=
Putnam gave to a 1979 paper:  =3DE2=3D80=3D9CPhilosophy of Mathematics:  Wh=
y Noth=3D=0A=
ing=0A=
Works.=3DE2=3D80=3D9D=0A=
=0A=
To Harris, this looks a bit vieux jeu.  The sense of crisis in the=0A=
profession, so acute less than a century ago, has receded; the old=0A=
difficulties have been patched up or papered over.  If you ask a=0A=
contemporary mathematician to declare a philosophical party affiliation,=0A=
the joke goes, you=3DE2=3D80=3D99ll hear =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cplatonist=3DE2=3D80=
=3D9D on weekdays =3D=0A=
and =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cformalist=3DE2=3D80=3D9D on=0A=
Sundays:  that is, when they=3DE2=3D80=3D99re working at mathematics, mathe=

ningle=3D=0A=
ss=0A=
game played with formal symbols.=0A=
=0A=
Today, as Harris observes, paradigm shifts in mathematics have less to=0A=
do with =3DE2=3D80=3D9Ccrisis=3DE2=3D80=3D9D and more to do with finding su=
perior metho=3D=0A=
ds.  It used=0A=
to be thought, for example, that all mathematics could be constructed=0A=
out of sets.  Starting with the simple idea of one thing being a member=0A=
of another, set theory shows how structures of seemingly limitless=0A=
complexity=3DE2=3D80=3D94number systems, geometrical spaces, a never-ending=
  hiera=3D=0A=
rchy=0A=

s.  Th=3D=0A=

number zero, for example, can be defined as the =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cempty set=3D=
E2=3D80=3D9D=3D=0A=
:  that is,=0A=
the set that has no members at all.  The number one can then be defined=0A=
as the set that contains one element=3DE2=3D80=3D94zero and nothing else.  =
Two, i=3D=0A=
n=0A=
turn, can be defined as the set that contains zero and one=3DE2=3D80=3D94an=
d so o=3D=0A=
n,=0A=
with the set for each subsequent number containing the sets for all the=0A=
previous numbers.  Numbers, instead of being taken as basic, can thus be=0A=
viewed as pure sets of increasingly intricate structure.=0A=

0=3D9D It ce=3D=0A=
rtainly=0A=
appeared that way to the members of Bourbaki.  Yet a few decades after=0A=
their program got underway, the extraordinary Alexander Grothendieck=0A=
came into their midst and transcended it.  In doing so, he created a new=0A=
style of pure mathematics that proved as fruitful as it was dizzyingly=0A=
abstract.  Long before his death last November at the age of eighty-six=0A=
in a remote hamlet in the Pyrenees, Grothendieck had come to be regarded=0A=
as the greatest mathematician of the last half-century.  As Harris=0A=
observes, he likely qualifies as the =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cmost romantic,=3DE2=3D8=

  =3DE2=3D80=3D9Chis life=0A=

=0A=
The raw facts are astounding enough.  Alexander Grothendieck was born in=0A=
Berlin in 1928 to parents who were both active anarchists.  His father,=0A=
a Russian Jew, took part in the 1905 uprising against the tsarist regime=0A=
and the 1917 revolution.  He escaped imprisonment under the Bolsheviks;=0A=
clashed with Nazi thugs on the streets of Berlin; fought on the=0A=
Republican side in the Spanish civil war (as did Grothendieck=3DE2=3D80=3D9=
9s mot=3D=0A=
her);=0A=
and was deported, after the fall of France, from Paris to Auschwitz to=0A=
be murdered.=0A=
=0A=
His mother, a gentile from Hamburg, raised Grothendieck in the south of=0A=
France.  There the boy showed talent both for numbers and for boxing.=0A=
After the war, he made his way to Paris to study mathematics under the=0A=
great Henri Cartan.  Following early teaching stints in S=3DC3=3DA3o Paulo,=
=0A=
Kansas, and Harvard, Grothendieck was invited in 1958 to join the=0A=
Institut des Hautes =3DC3=3D89tudes Scientifiques, which had just been foun=

by=0A=
a private businessman outside Paris in the woods of Bois-Marie.  There=0A=

mathematics.=0A=

=3DE2=3D80=3D9D=3DE2=3D=0A=
=3D80=3D94in which hitherto=0A=
unimaginable ideas could be expressed.  He was the first, Harris=0A=
observes (breaking into emphatic boldface), =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cto be guided by =
the=0A=
principle that knowing a mathematical object is tantamount to knowing=0A=
its relations to all other objects of the same kind.=3DE2=3D80=3D9D In othe=

=0A=
Such a peer group of mathematical objects is called, in a deliberate nod=0A=
to Aristotle and Kant, a =3DE2=3D80=3D9Ccategory.=3DE2=3D80=3D9D One catego=
ry might con=3D=0A=
sist of=0A=
abstract surfaces.  These surfaces play together, in the sense that=0A=
there are natural ways of going back and forth between them that respect=0A=
their general form.  For example, if two surfaces have the same number=0A=
of holes=3DE2=3D80=3D94like a donut and a coffee mug=3DE2=3D80=3D94one surf=
ace can, mat=3D=0A=

be smoothly transformed into the other.=0A=
=0A=
Another category might consist of all the different algebraic systems=0A=
that have an operation akin to multiplication; these algebras too play=0A=
together, in the sense that there are natural ways of going back and=0A=
forth between them that respect their common multiplicative structure.=0A=
Such structure-preserving back-and-forth relations among objects in the=0A=
same category are called =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cmorphisms,=3DE2=3D80=3D9D or someti=

l shape of the play=0A=
within a category.=0A=
=0A=
And here=3DE2=3D80=3D99s where it gets interesting:  the play in one catego=
ry=3DE2=3D=0A=
=3D80=3D94say, the=0A=
category of surfaces=3DE2=3D80=3D94might be subtly mimicked by the play in=
=0A=
another=3DE2=3D80=3D94say, the category of algebras.  The two categories th=
emselv=3D=0A=
es=0A=
can be seen to play together:  there is a natural way of going back and=0A=
forth between them, called a =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cfunctor.=3DE2=3D80=3D9D Armed w=
ith such a f=3D=0A=
unctor, one=0A=
can reason quite generally about both categories, without getting bogged=0A=
down in the particular details of each.  It might also be noticed that,=0A=
since categories play with one another, they themselves form a category:=0A=
the category of categories.=0A=
=0A=
Category theory was invented in the 1940s by Saunders Mac Lane of the=0A=
University of Chicago and Samuel Eilenberg of Columbia.  At first it was=0A=
regarded dubiously by many mathematicians, earning the nickname=0A=
=3DE2=3D80=3D9Cabstract nonsense.=3DE2=3D80=3D9D How could such a rarefied =
approach to =3D=0A=
mathematics,=0A=
in which nearly all its classical content seemed to be drained away,=0A=
result in anything but sterility?  Yet Grothendieck made it sing.=0A=
Between 1958 and 1970, he used category theory to create novel=0A=
structures of unexampled richness.  Since then, the heady abstractions=0A=
of category theory have also become useful in theoretical physics,=0A=
computer science, logic, and philosophy.*=0A=
=0A=
The project undertaken by Grothendieck was one that began with=0A=
Descartes:  the unification of geometry and algebra.  These have been=0A=
likened to the yin and yang of mathematics:  geometry is space, algebra=0A=
is time; geometry is like painting, algebra is like music; and so on.=0A=
Less fancifully, geometry is about form, algebra is about structure=3DE2=3D=
80=3D=0A=
=3D94in=0A=
particular, the structure that lurks within equations.  And as Descartes=0A=
showed with his invention of =3DE2=3D80=3D9CCartesian coordinates,=3DE2=3D8=
0=3D9D equat=3D=0A=
ions can=0A=
describe forms:  x2 + y2 =3D3D 1, for example, describes a circle of radius=
=0A=
1. So algebra and geometry turn out to be intimately related, exchanging=0A=
what Andr=3DC3=3DA9 Weil called =3DE2=3D80=3D9Csubtle caresses.=3DE2=3D80=
=3D9D=0A=
=0A=
In the 1940s, thanks to Weil=3DE2=3D80=3D99s insight, it became apparent th=
at the=0A=
dialectic between geometry and algebra was the key to resolving some of=0A=
the most stubbornly enduring mysteries in mathematics.  And it was=0A=
Grothendieck=3DE2=3D80=3D99s labor that raised this dialectic to such a pit=
ch of=0A=
abstraction=3DE2=3D80=3D94one that was said to leave even the great Weil da=
unted=3D=0A=
=3DE2=3D80=3D94that=0A=
a new understanding of these mysteries emerged.  Grothendieck laid the=0A=
groundwork for many of the greatest mathematical advances in recent=0A=
decades, including the 1994 proof of Fermat=3DE2=3D80=3D99s Last Theorem=3D=
E2=3D80=3D94=3D=0A=
a magnificent=0A=
intellectual achievement of zero practical or commercial interest.=0A=
=0A=
Harris, whose own impressive work is much indebted to Grothendieck, is=0A=
eloquent in praising his =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cruthless=3DE2=3D80=3DA6 minimalism,=
=3DE2=3D80=3D9D wh=3D=0A=
ich extended to his=0A=
contempt for money and his monkish wardrobe.  I only wish that Harris=0A=
had more conspicuously credited another figure in the modern=0A=
transformation of mathematics, Emmy Noether.  It was Noether, born in=0A=
Bavaria in 1882, who largely created the abstract approach that inspired=0A=
category theory.  Yet as a woman in a male academic world, she was=0A=
barred from holding a professorship in G=3DC3=3DB6ttingen, and the classici=
sts=0A=
and historians on the faculty even tried to block her from giving unpaid=0A=
lectures=3DE2=3D80=3D94leading David Hilbert, the dean of German mathematic=

=0A=
The intellectual habit of grappling with a problem by ascending to=0A=
higher and higher levels of generality came naturally to Emmy Noether,=0A=
and it was shared by Grothendieck, who said that he liked to solve a=0A=
problem not by the =3DE2=3D80=3D9Chammer-and-chisel method,=3DE2=3D80=3D9D =
but by letti=3D=0A=

   In his vis=3D=0A=
ion, the=0A=
familiar things dealt with by mathematicians, like equations, functions,=0A=
and even geometrical points, were reborn as vastly more complex and=0A=
versatile structures.  The old things turned out to be mere shadows=3DE2=3D=
80=3D=0A=
=3D94or,=0A=
as Grothendieck preferred to call them, =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cavatars=3DE2=3D80=3D=

f the new.  (An=0A=

=0A=
Nor is this a one-off process.  Each new abstraction is eventually=0A=
revealed to be but an avatar of a still-higher abstraction.  As Harris=0A=
puts it, =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cthe available concepts are interpreted as the avata=
rs of =3D=0A=
the=0A=
inaccessible concepts we are trying to grasp.=3DE2=3D80=3D9D With the grasp=
ing of=0A=
these new concepts, mathematics ascends a kind of =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cladder=3DE=
2=3D80=3D9D =3D=0A=
of increasing=0A=
abstraction.=0A=
=0A=
This, Harris says, is what philosophers should be paying attention to.=0A=
=3DE2=3D80=3D9CIf you were to ask for a single characteristic of contempora=
ry=0A=
mathematics that cries out for philosophical analysis,=3DE2=3D80=3D9D he wr=

in search of meaning, rather than searching for solid Foundations.=3DE2=3D8=
0=3D9D=3D=0A=
  And=0A=
what lies at the top of this ladder?  Perhaps, Harris suggests with=0A=
playful seriousness, there is One Big Theorem from which all of=0A=
mathematics ultimately flows=3DE2=3D80=3D94=3DE2=3D80=3D9Csomething on the =
order of sam=3D=0A=
sara =3D3D=0A=
nirvana.=3DE2=3D80=3D9D But since there are infinitely many rungs to climb,=
  it is=0A=
unattainable.=0A=
=0A=
Here, then, is the pathos of mathematics.  Unlike theoretical physics,=0A=
which can aspire to a =3DE2=3D80=3D9Cfinal theory=3DE2=3D80=3D9D that would=
  account for=3D=0A=
  all the=0A=
forces and particles in the universe, pure mathematics must concede the=0A=
futility of its own quest for ultimate truth.  As Harris observes,=0A=
=3DE2=3D80=3D9Cevery veil lifted only reveals another veil.=3DE2=3D80=3D9D =
The mathemat=3D=0A=

discovery of such an inconsistency would be fatal to pure mathematics,=0A=
at least as we know it today.  The distinction between truth and=0A=
falsehood would be breached, the ladder of avatars would come crashing=0A=
