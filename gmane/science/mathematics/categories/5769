Dear John and Michael,

It all depends on where you start counting.
For americans, the first floor of a buiding is the ground floor
but for most europeans, it is the floor right above:=20

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storey#Numbering

We sometime need to recall in which part of the world we are=20
when we take an elevator!
But a ten stories building is the same for everyone. =20

I understand your ideas both. Along the same line we could also use:

E1-category =3D Monoidal =20
E2-category =3D Braided monoidal=20
E3-category =3D .....

My goal is to have a public discussion on terminology.
It can be very difficult to agree upon because
adopting one is like commiting to a rule of law,
to a moral code, possibly to a social code.
There is an emotional and social aspect to this commitment.
There is also a psychological aspect because a terminology
looks natural if you use it long enough (it is a matter of a few days).
I hope that a public discussion can help peoples=20
choosing their terminology.

I do think that my terminology for higher braided
monoidal categories is quite good.
Let me say a few things in its defense:

First, it extends naturally a terminology which is used=20
by the mathematical community since many decades.
Only a specialist can truly appreciate E(k)-categories or=20
k-tuply monoidal categories. Second, a braiding is a commutation=20
structure. To call a monoidal category 1-braided is kind of=20
confusing because there is no commutation structure=20
on a general monoidal category. A monoidal category is 0-braided.=20
Third, a n-braided (topological or simplicial) group is exactly what=20
you need to describe the homotopy type of an n-connected space (n\geq =
1).=20


I wonder who introduced the notion of E(n)-space and
the terminology?


Best regards,=20
