Dear Dmitry,

Let me write then F(X) = A@X, denoting the tensor product over k by @.
Hence, briefly, @ is + (coproduct) in k-Alg. The fact that, when A is flat
as a k-module, A+(-) : k-Alg --> k-Alg preserves finite limits is absolutely
classical, as well as its proof via modules. However, you do not need the
fully faithful functor from k-Mod to k-Alg given by the square-zero
extension for that: simply use the fact the forgetful functor k-Alg -->
k-Mod not only preserves limits, but also reflects isomorphisms (Some people
prefer to say/use "creates isomorphisms").

The preservation of finite limits by A+(-) : k-Alg --> k-Alg (already for
modules) implies, for example, Grothendieck's Descent Theorem saying that if
A is flat, then k --> A is an effective descent morphism. However, much
stronger result is known now: k --> A is an effective descent morphism if
and only if it is pure as a monomorphism of k-modules. This stronger result,
commonly known as an unpublished theorem of A. Joyal and M. Tierney, was
claimed several times by various authors, and I can tell you more if you are
interested.

Anyway, since the category k-Alg has very bad exactness properties in a
sense, modules were used by category-theorists themselves. And, in spite of
nice results mentioned by Richard Garner and Steve Lack, I still suggest
not to go through a generalization of the abelian case. Well, such a
suggestion surely cannot be "universal", and if you need a better
suggestion, you should tell us why are you doing this - if I may say so.

Best regards,

George Janelidze
