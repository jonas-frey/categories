Call for abstracts:

     Mathematical Logic in the Netherlands 2011

                 19-20 May 2011

             University of Groningen

         http://www.ai.rug.nl/MLNL2011/

MLNL'11 is the third issue of a series of yearly meetings on Mathematical
Logic (and related areas) in the Netherlands. The first meeting was held in
Nijmegen and the second one in Utrecht. Rather than a specialized
conference, where advanced research results are reported, we aim to get to
know each other better and, by understanding the various branches of logic
represented in the Netherlands, strengthen our community.

We have reserved a generous amount of time for expository talks, but also
strongly encourage contributions by young researchers and Ph.D. students.
Advanced master students in logic are most welcome to attend the meeting
too. In all, we hope to create an environment where we can share common
interests and where we may fruitfully explore possibilities of collaboration
in research, Ph.D. projects, and teaching.

Expository Invited Talks:

     Henk Barendregt, University of Nijmegen
     Jaap van Oosten, University of Utrecht
     Alessandra Palmigiano, University of Amsterdam
     Bas Spitters, University of Nijmegen
