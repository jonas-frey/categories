[note from moderator: please direct any responses to the poster, thanks]

It seems prima facie obvious that category theory ought to attract
mathematicians with a philosophical bent, given its potential to
revolutionise foundational issues and the perspective on the nature of
structure that it affords. But do category theorists interest themselves
in aspects of philosophy not directly related to mathematics? I'd be
interested to hear from the category theorists on this group, as well as
about the category theorists that you know or knew well enough to give a
definitive answer.

Of course, if ostensibly nonmathematical philosophy ended up having a
relation to mathematical philosophy or to category theory itself, that
counts too.

I hope that this somewhat extracurricular question is not considered out
of place, and welcome correction if it is.
