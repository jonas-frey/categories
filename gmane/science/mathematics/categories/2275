Hi Vaughan,

Regarding these and similar questions, I suggest looking at the following
two gems:

A. L. Foster, Gerneralized "Boolean" theory of universal algebras, Part II.
Identities and subdirect sums of functionally complete algebras, Math. Zeit.
59, 1953, 191-199.

T.-K. Hu, Stone duality for primal algebra theory, Math. Zeit. 110, 1060,
180-198.
