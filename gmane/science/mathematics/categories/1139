I am reviewing a paper whose main result sounds like it ought to be known.
Is it and can anyone give me a citation?

Let E be a cocomplete category with a small dense subcategory C (so every
e of E is the colimit of C/e --> E).  Then an object \Omega of E is a
subobject classifier in E iff it represents the subobject functor
restricted to C.
