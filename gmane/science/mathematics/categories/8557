If your idea is to mimic the construction used for modelling partial function
as (total) function in Kleisli category for the monad (- ??? 1) in Set then this does
not work in Cat.
The reason is that a functor P : C ??? D ??? 1 in order to correspond to a partial
functor P' : S ??? C ??? D should send the category S in D and al the other stuff in 1,
nonetheless is ?? : s ??? c is a morphism from an object of S to an object in C ??? S
there is no way to map ?? in a morphism in D ??? 1 (= D + 1 in your notation),
because the two subcategories D and 1 in D ??? 1 are disjoint/disconnected
and s should be mapped in D while c should be mapped in 1.
