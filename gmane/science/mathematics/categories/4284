I wrote in part:

I have one and a half things backwards here.

First of all, of course negation is [X, 0] rather than [0, X].
(But in exponential notation, it is 0^X; that is my excuse.)

Also, my placement of "can" implies that the relevant question
is whether there ~exists~ a topos E (with given properties)
and there exists an object X in E (with the properties that I described);
rather, the question is whether for ~every~ E (with given properties)
there exists an object X in E (with the properties that I described).
Iff so, then the properties required of E are omega-inconsistent.
(Iff E must be a terminal category, then they are simply inconsistent.
Thus omega-inconsistency is weaker than inconsistency,
and omega-consistency is stronger than mere consistency.)
