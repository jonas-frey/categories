This is a first announcement and call for participation for a Fields =
Institute Workshop on the interaction between category theory and =
semigroup theory. The workshop will take place at the University of =
Ottawa, May 2-4 2010, and everyone interested is welcome to attend.

Topic, aims and scope: while the connection between inverse semigroups =
and ordered groupoids has been known for quite a while, it has only =
become clear fairly recently that many results and constructions in =
semigroup theory have natural and canonical topos-theoretic =
interpretations. The workshop aims to explore these connections, as well =
as those to locale theory, etale groupoids, categories of partial maps =
and also to operator algebras.
The purpose is to bring together representatives from each of these =
areas, to further promote interaction and to develop new perspectives on =
the challenges in the field. There will be several tutorial talks which =
have the specific aim of bringing newcomers and non-experts up to speed =
on the central concepts, techniques and results of category theory and =
semigroup theory, and to introduce them to etale groupoids and operator =
algebras.

Invited speakers: Robin Cockett (Calgary), Thierry Giordano (Ottawa) =
Mark Lawson (Heriot Watt), Ernie Manes (Massachussets), Dorette Pronk =
(Dalhousie), Pedro Resende (Lisboa) and John Rhodes (Berkeley).

Student Support: graduate students are particularly encouraged to =
attend, and some funding is available in order to support their travel. =
Those who wish to apply for support can fill out the form on the =
workshop web page. Priority will be given to those students who do not =
have access to other funding.

Registration: online registration is now open at:

http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/09-10/semigroups/index.=
html

Accommodation: early May is a busy time in Ottawa and participants are =
urged to book sooner than later. We have reserved a block of rooms at =
the Quality Inn Hotel (10 min. walk from campus); please contact Pieter =
Hofstra for the booking code.
