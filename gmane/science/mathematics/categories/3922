I call to your attention our new book: "Memory Evolutive Systems: =20
Hierarchy, Emergence, Cognition", by Andr=E9e Ehresmann and Jean-Paul =20
Vanbremeersch, published in Elsevier's Series on Multidisciplinarity =20
(Volume 4, 2007).
This book, based on a 20 years long series of papers, develops the =20
theory of Memory Evolutive Systems which we have introduced as a =20
mathemati-cal model, based on category theory, for complex natural =20
systems, such as biological, social or cognitive systems. It shows how =20
well-known categorical operations (in particular (co)limits, partial =20
completions of categories and fibrations) give an approach to the =20
problems of hierarchy, emergence/reductionism, self-organization and =20
learning.
The main tools are exposed in Part A (Hierarchy and emergence), the =20
global theory in Part B (Memory Evolutive Systems), and Part C =20
(Applications to cognition and consciousness) is devoted to the case =20
of cognitive systems, studying the formation of a procedural and a =20
semantic memory allowing for the emergence of higher cognitive =20
processes up to consciousness.
The book is written for a multidisciplinary audience, with many =20
illustrative examples in the most varied domains, but also with short =20
proofs of the main mathematical results. An animation can be found on =20
the internet site:

Comments and critics will be most welcomed.
