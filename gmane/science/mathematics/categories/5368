A colloquium is a good place for expressing wild ideas.
But they must be related to something everyone can understand and touch.
I suggest you talk about "The field with one element" if you think=20
the subject can fit your audience.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_with_one_element

Many things in this subject are very speculative
but there are also a few concrete developpements.=20
One is the algebraic geometry "under SpecZ" of Toen and Vaqui=E9.
Another due to Borger is using lambda-rings.
What is a lambda-ring?
In their book "Riemann-Roch-Algebra" Fulton and Lang define a =
lambda-ring
to be a pre-lambda-ring satisfying two complicated identities [(1.4) and =
(1.5)]
[Beware that F&L are using an old terminology: they call a lambda-ring a =
"special lambda-ring"
and they call a pre-lambda-ring a "lambda-ring"]
The notion of lambda-ring (ie of "special lambda-ring" in the =
terminology of F&L)
can be defined in a natural way if we use category theory.=20
Let Z[]:CMon ---> CRing be the functor which associates to a commutative =
monoid M the=20
ring Z[M] freely generated by M (it is the left adjoint to the forgetful =
functor in the
opposite direction). If we compose the functot Z[] with the forgetful =
functor U:CRing --->Set
we obtain a functor V:CMon --->Set. The algebraic theory of lambda-rings =

can be defined to be the theory of natural operations on the functor V.
The total lambda operation V(M)--->V(M)[[t]] is the group homomorphism =
Z[M]--->1+tZ[M][[t]]=20
which takes an element x\in M to the power series 1+tx.


Best,
Andr=E9
