Dear colleagues,=0A=
=0A=
My mathematical biography of Myles was written quickly.=0A=
After posting it, I realised that Andreas Blass, Andrej Scedrov and John Gr=
ay=0A=
were not in my list of people attending the NY category theory seminar.=0A=
My deepest apology to them! =0A=
In case your name is not mentionned, let me know. =0A=
=0A=
Also, I realised that I had been silent about our book =0A=
"Element of simplicial homotopy theory" =0A=
which we have been writing for more than 20 years.=0A=
The book is unfinished, but there are parts =0A=
available on the web:=0A=
=0A=
http://mat.uab.cat/~kock/crm/hocat/advanced-course/Quadern47.pdf=0A=
=0A=
There are small corrections to be done. =0A=
We agreed to put the whole manuscript on the web.=0A=
It will be available at the beginning of 2018.=0A=
=0A=
Best regards,=0A=

=0A=
Dear All,=0A=
=0A=
As you may know, my friend and collaborator Myles Tierney passed away a few=
   days ago.=0A=
I thank you all for the condolences expressed.=0A=
I would like to briefly recall the contributions of Myles to mathematics an=
d our collaboration.=0A=
=0A=
Myles received his Phd from Columbia University in 1965, under the directio=
n of Samuel Eilenberg=0A=
with a dissertation on "Classifying Spaces for K-Theory mod P".=0A=
He belongs to a cohort of Eilenberg's students (Lawvere:1963, Applegate:196=
5, Tierney:1965, Beck:1967)=0A=
that was to have a major influence on the developement of category theory.=
=0A=
After his Phd, he was invited by Eldon Dyer to join the faculty at Rice uni=
versity in Houston.=0A=
He left Rice after 15 months to visit the ETH Forschungsinstitut f=FBr Math=
ematics in Zurich, where Beno Eckmann=0A=
was assembling a group of category theorists and algebraic geometers that i=
ncluded=0A=
Bill Lawvere (1964-67,1968-69), Myles Tierney (1966-1968), Peter Gabriel, J=
on Beck, Peter Freyd and Mike Barr.=0A=
Myles worked on the simplicial construction of spectra and he published his=
   work in a Lecture Notes=0A=
"Categorical Constructions in Stable Homotopy Theory".=0A=
Lawvere worked on the axiomatic of the category of categories and he collab=
orated with Myles on=0A=
finding new axioms for toposes. Having introduced the sub-object classifier=
, he discovered=0A=
the notion of elementary topos and Myles discovered that a Grothendieck top=
ology is the same thing=0A=
as a closure operator on the sub-object classifier. They  kept developing t=
he theory of elementary topoi=0A=
when they both joined Dalhousie University in 1969. While at Dalhousie, the=
y organised an international=0A=
conference on topos theory (January 1971) with the participation of algebra=
ic geometers, category theorists and=0A=
logicians (Bucur, Giraud, Goodman, Kock, Myhill, Illusie, Lambek, Scott, Ve=
rdier, Tierney, etc).=0A=
The proceedings of the conference include the paper "Sheaf theory and the C=
ontinuum Hypothesis"=0A=
    in which Myles constructs a boolean topos satisfying the axiom of choice=
  but for which the=0A=
Continuum Hypothesis fails. His construction showed that the forcing method=
s introduced by Paul Cohen=0A=
were essentially sheaf theoretic in nature. The paper had a strong influenc=
e on the subsequent developements=0A=
of the logical aspects of topos theory. Unfortunately, the collaboration be=
tween Myles and Bill ended in Dalhousie,=0A=
partly because of the political turmoil of that period. Myles joined the fa=
culty at Rutgers and=0A=
Bill the faculty at the University of Buffalo NY.  Myles has two papers on =
classifying topo=EF; in the first,=0A=
"On the spectrum of a Ringed Topos",  he uses the Stone dual of the spectru=
m of a commutative ring to give a=0A=
new construction of Hakim's spectrum of a ringed topos; in the second paper=
   "Forcing topologies and Classifying Topoi",=0A=
he shows that any (elementary) geometric theory has a classifying (elementa=
ry) topos.=0A=
The two papers were published in the proceedings of a conference in honour =
of Eilenberg,=0A=
with the participations of Maurice Auslander, Kuo-Tsai Chen, Barry Mitchell=
, Eldon Dyer, Peter Freyd. John Gray,=0A=
Dale Husemoller, Daniel Kan, Bill Lawvere, Saunders Mac Lane, John Moore an=
d Alex Rosenberg.=0A=
I began to collaborate with Myles in 1979, but our work was brutally interr=
upted by a=0A=
    terrible accident that left Myles physically crippled for the rest of hi=
s  life.=0A=
His determination to survive and his willingness to keep doing mathematics =
were admirable.=0A=
We eventually published the fruit of our collaboration in the AMS Memoir=0A=
"An extension of the Galois theory of Grothendieck".=0A=
We showed that every Grothendieck topos can be represented by a localic gro=
upoid.=0A=
The result was shedding some light on Grothendieck's view that toposes are =
generalised spaces.=0A=
Grothendieck had introduced various cohomology theories for toposes (we may=
   argue that toposes were=0A=
precisely invented for that reason) but there was virtually no homotopy the=
ory.=0A=
We wondered if one could construct the analog of a Postnikov tower for a to=
pos?=0A=
There was a clear analogy between atomic toposes (introduced by Barr) and K=
(G,1) spaces.=0A=
I visited Columbia University in 1982-84 and we had a weekly seminar=0A=
with the participation of Alex Heller and Bob Thomason.=0A=
During that time, I succeeded in constructing a Quillen model structure on =
the category=0A=
of simplicial objects of any Grothendieck topos; the model structure has ap=
plications to=0A=
to higher stacks and to non-abelian cohomology, but the connection between=
=0A=
the topos structure and the model structure was mysterious.=0A=
We began to investigate this question systematically. We eventually showed =
that the category=0A=
of internal groupoids in the topos of simplicial sets admits a model struct=
ure which is Quillen equivalent=0A=
to the model category of simplical sets.=0A=
We later extended the equivalence to the category of simplical objects in a=
   general Grothendieck topos.=0A=
=0A=
In retrospect, the hypothesis that the topos of simplicial sets was the rig=
ht framework for understanding=0A=
the homotopy theory of spaces was off the mark. A better framework is the n=
otion of *model topos* (=3Dhigher topos)=0A=
introduced  by Charles Rezk in the late nineties and which served as a fram=
ework in the derived algebraic=0A=
of Bertrand To=EBn, Gabriele Vezzosi and Jacob Lurie. But we were not entir=
ely off the mark!=0A=
The notion of higher topos depends on higher categories to the same extent =
that  the notion of topos depends=0A=
on categories (and the notion of Heyting algebra depends on posets). In our=
  paper "Quasi-categories vs Segal spaces", we show  that the model structur=
e for quasi-categories is Quillen equivalent to the=0A=
model category for complete Segal spaces (introduced by Rezk) and to the mo=
del category for Segal categories=0A=
(introduced by Hirschowitz and Simpson). The equivalences now fit into a la=
rger network described by Julie Bergner=0A=
and which provides a foundation to higher category theory.=0A=
=0A=
Myles was the advisor of seven phd:=0A=
=0A=
Ira Wolf (Rutgers, 1971)=0A=
Radu Diaconescu (Dalhousie, 1973)=0A=
Carol Keller (Rutgers, 1983)=0A=
Norman S. Adam (Rutgers, 1984)=0A=
Terence Lindgren (Rutgers, 1984)=0A=
Todd Trimble (Rutgers, 1994)=0A=
Mauri Luca (Rutgers, 1998)=0A=
=0A=
Radu Diaconescu has many contributions to topos theory.=0A=
Tod Trimble has proved an important coherence theorem for star-autonomous c=
ategories;=0A=
he has contributions to higher category theory.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
For many years, Myles organised with Heller a yearly NY category theory mee=
ting.=0A=
Hanne and Myles joyfully opened their Soho loft to all. I often sleept on t=
he floor in a sleeping bag!=0A=
Nobody wanted to miss the saturday night gathering which often included=0A=
Eilenberg, Mac Lane, Heller, Linton, Bass, Lawvere, Beck, Freyd, Barr, Mitc=
hell, Dubuc, Duskin, Par=E9, Makkai, Bunge,  Diaconescu, Pelletier, Niefiel=
d, Schanuel, MacDonald,=0A=
Wood, Rosebrugh,Tholen, Scedrov, Blass, Gray and many others, sometime visi=
tors from Europe and Australia.=0A=
