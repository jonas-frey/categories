MPC '98

               Fourth International Conference on=20

               MATHEMATICS OF PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION
               -----------------------------------

             http://www.md.chalmers.se/Conf/MPC98/
            =20
                      June 15 - 17, 1998

                       Marstrand, Sweden

                        CALL FOR PAPERS

The general theme of this series of conferences is the use of crisp,
clear mathematics in the discovery and design of algorithms and in the
development of corresponding software or hardware. The conference
theme reflects the growing interest in formal, mathematically based
methods for the construction of software and hardware. The goal of the
MPC conferences is to report on and significantly advance the state of
the art in this area. Previous conferences were held in 1989 at
Twente, The Netherlands, organised by the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,
in
1992 at Oxford, United Kingdom, and in 1995 at Kloster Irsee, Germany,
organised by Augsburg University.

                            TOPICS

The emphasis is on the combination of  c o n c i s e n e s s  and=20
p r e c i s i o n  in  c a l c u l a t i o n a l  t e c h n i q u e s=20
for program construction. We solicit high quality papers on original
research, typically in one of the following areas:

  - formal specification of sequential and concurrent programs;
  - constructing implementations to meet specifications;

in particular,

  - program transformation;
  - program analysis;
  - program verification;
  - convincing case studies.

While this list is not exclusive it is intended to show the focus of the
conference.

We expect to publish the proceedings as a Springer LNCS, ready at
the conference.

                             VENUE

Marstrand is a small island on the beautiful westcoast of Sweden, 40
km from G=F6teborg. The charming old houses, the fortress, the walking
paths, and the absence of cars make this island a very pleasant
resort. There are direct flights to G=F6teborg Landvetter from most
European main cities, and busses from G=F6teborg to Marstrand.

                          SUBMISSION

Full papers should be submitted in Postscript format by e-mail to
reach Johan Jeuring by December 15, 1997. The details of the
submission procedure can be found at
