Dear Andrej,

I take it by unit you mean identity (1). Then in the category of =
commutative
rings with 1, you presumably want the 1 to be preserved. So Z is =
initial, and
the trivial ring is terminal.

On the category of commutative rings without 1 (i.e. not necessarily =
having a 1),
there is a monoidal structure, formed by tensoring the underlying =
abelian groups,
and equipping this with the usual multiplication. (This would be the =
coproduct
in the category of commutative rings with 1, but it is not the coproduct =
here.)
If you allow yourself to use this extra structure, then Z is =
characterized as
the unit object for the tensor product.

The category of commutative rings with 1, but homomorphisms not =
necessarily=20
preserving it, seems rather unnatural, but for what it's worth, the =
tensor=20
product of the previous paragraph restricts to this category, and so can =
be
used to characterize Z once again.

Regards,

Steve Lack.

Subject: categories: Characterization of integers as a commutative ring =
with unit
=20
For the purposes of defining the data structure of integers in a
Coq-like system, I am looking for an _algebraic_ characterization of
integers Z as a commutative ring with unit. (The one-element ring is a
ring.)

Some possible characterizations which I don't much like:

1) Z is the free group generated by one generator. I want the ring
structure, not the group structure.

2) Z is the free ring generated by the semiring of natural numbers. This
just translates the problem to characterization of the semiring of
natural numbers.

3) Z is the initial non-trivial ring. This is no good because
"non-trivial" is an inequality "0 =3D/=3D 1" rather than an equality.

4) Let R be the free commutative ring with unit generated by X. Then Z
is the image of the homomorphism R --> R which maps X to 0. This is just
ugly and there must be something better.

I feel like I am missing something obvious. Surely Z appears as a
prominent member of the category of commutative rings with unit, does it
not?

Best regards,

Andrej
