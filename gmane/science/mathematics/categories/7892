Daniel Kan???s influence at MIT persists through something called the Kan
seminar, a graduate reading course in algebraic topology. Over the course
of a semester, each student is asked to give a few one-hour lectures
summarizing classic papers in the field and to engage with each other
paper by writing a reading response. The lectures are preceded by a
practice talk of unbounded length that is conducted in private, i.e., in
the absence of the lead instructor, before the reading responses are due.
This format aims to teach students how to read papers quickly and at
various levels of depth, as well as to work on presentation skills. At the
semester???s conclusion, Kan traditionally hosted a party that took
advantage of Boston???s high concentration of mathematicians, giving his
students an opportunity to meet senior people in the field.

This (northern hemisphere) spring, from early January to late June 2014, I
plan to run an online (???extension???) Kan seminar in category theory with
the aim of reading the twelve papers listed below. I am seeking between 6
and 12 participants who will compose one or two blog posts to appear on
the n-Category Caf?? over the course of the six months, which will be
published every other week. Everyone will be expected to write comments,
engaging with all of the papers.

On the week preceding each blog entry, the class will have a private
discussion (likely via Google hangout) on the paper in question. The
course will conclude with a series of short public expository lectures
given, by those able to attend, on June 29th in conjunction with the 2014
International Category Theory Conference at Cambridge, UK.

The list of papers is below. More details, including information about how
to apply, can be found on the seminar website:

www.math.harvard.edu/~eriehl/kan

Applications are due November 30th. I hope you???ll help me spread the word
by passing this message along to those who might be interested; I realize
that many students are not on this list.

All the best,
Emily Riehl
