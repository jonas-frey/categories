6th QPL workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic

April 8-9, 2009, Oxford, UK

This event has as its goal to bring together researchers working on
mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing and
spatio-temporal causal structures, and in particular those that use logical
tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages,
semantical methods and other computer science methods for the study physical
behaviour in general. Over the past couple of years there has been a growing
activity in these foundational approaches together with a renewed interest in
the foundations of quantum theory, which complement the more mainstream
research in quantum computation. A predecessor of this event, with the same
acronym, called Quantum Programming Languages, was held in Ottawa (2003), Turku
(2004), Chicago (2005) and Oxford (2006). The first QPL under the new name
Quantum Physics and Logic was held in Reykjavik (2008); with the change of name
and a new program committee we emphasise the intended much broader scope of
this event, aiming to nourish interaction between modern computer science
logic, quantum computation and information, models of spatio-temporal
causality, and quantum foundations, which resulted in an attractive program.

The event proceeds MFPS 2009, also in Oxford, at which there will a series of
tutorials to enable MFPS participants to also attend and comprehend the QPL
talks.

Submission procedure. Prospective speakers are invited to submit a 2-5 pages
abstract which provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest and
provides sufficient detail to allows the program committee to assess the merits
of the work. Submissions of works in progress are encouraged but must be more
substantial than a research proposal. We both encourage submissions of original
research as well as research submitted elsewhere. Authors of accepted original
research contributions will be invited to submit a full paper to a special
issue of a journal yet to be decided on. Submissions should be in Postscript or
PDF format and should be sent to Bob Coecke by February 13, with as subject
line QPL Submission. Receipt of all submissions will be acknowledged by return
email. Accepted contributors will be able to publish extended versions of their
2-5 abstracts in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.

The workshop enjoys support from:
