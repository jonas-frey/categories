In Leuven, we have studied semantic data-specifications from a
categorical perspective. We have studied sketches as a formalism
for making semantic data-specifications (somewhat similar to the
approach taken by Diskin et al.), and have developed and proved
correct a number of interesting algorithms to decide semantical
equivalence of such specifications. The following publications describe
our work:

Frank Piessens, Eric Steegmans. ``Categorical data-specifications'',
{\em Theory and Applications of Categories}, Vol. 1, No. 8, 1995,
pp. 156--173.

Frank Piessens, Eric Steegmans. ``Proving semantical equivalence of
data specifications'', accepted for publication in the special
issue of {\em The Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra} dedicated
to the celebration of Peter Freyd's 60th birthday.

Frank Piessens. ``Semantic data specifications: an analysis based on
a categorical formalization'', PhD thesis, Dept. of Computer Science,
Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1996.
