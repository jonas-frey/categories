I thought this was exactly what Colin's version of the replacement

Osius uses a different construction than M&M: instead of explicitly
building "membership trees" he uses objects equipped with a transitive
well-founded relation to represent transitive sets, and subobjects of
them to represent arbitrary sets.  In general you do have to add a
"transitive representation" axiom to ensure that every object of the
topos can be reconstructed from the resulting model of bZ---but this
is unnecessary if you also assume choice, since then every object can
be well-ordered and thus admits a transitive well-founded relation.
