We are pleased to announce the

*Second School and Workshop on Univalent Mathematics*,

to be held at the University of Birmingham (UK), April 1-5, 2019
(https://unimath.github.io/bham2019)

Overview
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Homotopy Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies
a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type
theory. This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of
Univalent Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics
based on ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.

The UniMath library is a large repository of computer-checked
mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. It is based on the
computer proof assistant Coq.

In this school and workshop, we aim to introduce newcomers to the ideas
of Univalent Foundations and mathematics therein, and to formalizing
mathematics in a computer proof assistant based on Univalent Foundations.

Format
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
We will have two tracks:
- Beginners track
- Advanced track: suitable for participants with some experience in
Univalent Foundations and the proof assistant Coq.

In the beginners track, you will receive an introduction to Univalent
Foundations and to mathematics in those foundations, by leading experts
in the field. In the accompanying problem sessions, you will formalize
pieces of univalent mathematics in the UniMath library.
In the advanced track, you will work, in a small group, on formalizing a
specific topic in UniMath, guided by an expert in univalent mathematics.
Your code will become part of the UniMath library.

Application and funding

The deadline to apply is January 15, 2019.
Limited financial support is available to cover participants' travel and
lodging expenses.
