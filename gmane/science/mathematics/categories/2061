                              SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS
                                     CMCS2002

                         5th International Workshop on
                      Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science

                                 Grenoble, France
                                  6-7 April 2002

                       A satellite workshop of ETAPS 2002

Aims and Scope
--------------

During the last few years, it is becoming increasingly clear that a great
variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition systems,
automata, process calculi and class-based systems can be captured
uniformly as coalgebras.  Coalgebra is developing into a field of its own
interest presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a growing field of
applications and interactions with various other fields such as reactive
and interactive system theory, object oriented and concurrent programming,
formal system specification, modal logic, dynamical systems, control
systems, category theory, algebra, analysis, etc. The aim of the workshop
is to bring together researchers with a common interest in the theory of
coalgebras and its applications.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

       the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
               approaches);
       coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
               languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
       coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent)
               programming;
       coalgebras and data types;
       (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
               bisimulations or invariants);
       coalgebras and algebras;
       coalgebraic specification and verification;
       coalgebras and (modal) logic;
       coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid
               systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, and Genova. The proceedings appeared as Electronic
Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS) Volumes 11,19, 33, and 41.
You can get an idea of the types of papers presented at the meeting by
looking at the tables of contents of the ENTCS volumes from the meetings,
available at the ENTCS page.  For venue, registration and suggested
accommodation see the ETAPS2002 web page, http://www-etaps.imag.fr/


Submissions
-----------

Submissions will be evaluated by the Program Committee for inclusion in
the proceedings, which will be published in the ENTCS series. Papers must
contain original contributions, be clearly written, and include
appropriate reference to and comparison with related work. Papers (of at
most 15 pages) should be submitted electronically as uuencoded PostScript
files at the address cmcs@cs.indiana.edu. A separate message should also
be sent, with a text-only one-page abstract and with mailing addresses
(both postal and electronic), telephone number and fax number of the
corresponding author.



Important Dates
----------------

Deadline for submission: 8 January 2002.
Notification of acceptance: 20 February 2002.
Final version due: 10 March 2002.
Workshop dates: 6-7 April 2002.
