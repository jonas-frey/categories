1 ABOUT FM 2016
===============

   The 21st International Symposium on Formal Methods (FM 2016) will take
   place at St Raphael Resort in Limassol, Cyprus, 7-11 November 2016. FM
   2016 is the latest in a series of symposia organized by Formal
   Methods Europe, an independent association that encourages the use
   of, and research on, formal methods for the engineering of
   computer-based systems and software. The symposia have been notably
   successful in bringing together researchers and industrial users
   around a programme of original papers on research and industrial
   experience, workshops, tutorials, reports on tools, projects, and
   ongoing doctoral work.

2 WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
====================

   For this major event, we are now inviting proposals for workshops that
   will complement the main FM Symposium.

   The purpose of the workshops is to provide an informal setting for
   workshop participants to discuss technical issues, exchange research
   ideas, and to discuss and/or demonstrate applications. These workshops
   may be driven by fundamental academic interests or by needs from
   specific application domains. We encourage a diversity of workshops
   relating to different varieties of formal models.


   FM workshops will be held immediately before the main symposium, on
   7-8 November, 2016.


3 SUBMISSION INFORMATION
========================

   Researchers and practitioners wishing to organize a workshop are
   invited to submit proposals in PDF format by e-mail to the Workshops
   Chairs

   Nearchos Paspallis (npaspallis@uclan.ac.uk) and Martin Steffen
   (msteffen@ifi.uio.no).


   A proposal should not exceed three pages and should include a draft
   call-for-papers containing at least the following information:

   1. Title and brief technical description of the workshop, specifying
      the goals and the technical issues that will be its focus.

   2. The names and contact information (web page, email address) of the
      Programme Committee (PC) chairs, i.e., the workshop
      organisers. Moreover, a tentative list of workshop PC members
      should be given. We suggest one or two PC chairs and at least 10 PC
      members coming from different countries.


   Moreover, the following additional information is requested:


   1. If the workshop has taken place before: How often has the workshop
      taken place so far? Which conference(s) has the workshop been
      colocated with so far? Number of participants in the last
      instalment.

   2. A discussion of the proposed format and agenda.

   3. The proposed duration (half, one or two days).

   4. Procedures for selecting participants and papers.

   5. Potential invited speakers.

   6. Expected number of participants.


   Each workshop programme chair will be responsible for the following:

   1. Producing a web page and a "Call for Papers/Participation" for
      their workshop.

   2. Providing a brief description of the workshop for the conference
      web page and programme, and providing a workshop web page the
      conference can refer to for details.

   3. Selecting the papers for the workshop proceedings and providing the
      camera ready copies ready for publication.

   4. All advertising of the workshop.

   5. Appointing session chairs, etc.


   The local organisation of the conference will take care of the
   production of informal or electronic workshop proceedings, assuming
   that the proceedings are camera ready.
