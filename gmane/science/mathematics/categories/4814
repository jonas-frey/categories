[From the moderator:]

Your moderator will have only intermittent email contact May 3-15, so
there will be delays in posting during that period.

As noted below, archives of the categories list are now available in a
user friendly format. An archive in mail file format will continue to be
maintained and available from the list web page:

http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/categories.html

and the link below will be included there soon.

It took a while but categories@mta.ca archives starting from 1997 have
been successfully imported into gmane. It will take a while until all
the messages are correctly sorted by date.

The archives are accessible at

http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.science.mathematics.categories

Merit for the import should go to gmane's administrator, Lars Magne
Ingebrigtsen <larsi@gnus.org>

Thanks a lot for your help.

Yours sincerely,
