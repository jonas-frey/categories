I certainly heard Jon lecture on this a number of times.  PUblication?
Lot's of luck.  A quick glance at MathSciNet shows that there are an awful
lot of J. Beck's, at least one J.M. Beck and at least one Jonathan Beck,
but no paper by our Jon Beck on descent theory.  As for precise statement,
don't even think about it.  But my recollection was only whether a triple
could descend across a functor.  There were cocyle conditions that were
necessary and sufficient.  I think the "Beck-Chevalley condition" was a
simple example.

At one point, Jon told my wife with some regret that, thanks to my
insistence, he was finally published.  He seemed constitutionally
incapable of putting his thoughts in public.

I think you can suppose that if PTJ couldn't find it, it isn't there
except in the (increasingly feeble) memories of those who heard him.
