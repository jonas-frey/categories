While I offer no answer, I will point out that coequalizers here =

(and, by the same token, equalizers) need not look like what you
might expect. For example, when the commutative semiring R is the
ordinary ring of integers, so that the category of R-matrices "is" =

the full category of f.-g. free abelian groups, the coequalizer of
the pair of 1x1 matrices (2): 1 --> 1 and (0): 1 --> 1 exists and
is !: 1-->0 , with the "expected" coequalizer value of Z/2Z being =

"unavailable here."

So: beware! Cheers, -- Fred
