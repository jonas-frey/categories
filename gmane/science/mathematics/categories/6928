Why not use the term `indiscrete groupoid' for the functor that gives a
right adjoint to the  functor Ob: Groupoids \to Sets?   The left adjoint
is then of course the `discrete groupoid'.  This agrees with the
terminology for discrete and indiscrete topologies.

I confess to have used different  terminology in various places.

Of course one use of these notions is to show that the functor Ob
preserves limits and colimits, which is  a start on constructing them.

It is not surprising that this concept occurs widely. In groupoids there
is a notion of covering morphism and the universal cover of a group G
is of course an indiscrete groupoid G'; this groupoid is by no means
`trivial' since it comes equipped with a covering morphism  p: G' \to
G.  This approach to covering space theory is given in my book `Topology
and groupoids'.
