Ab is discrete abelian groups.  Thus the circle has, for these purposes,
the discrete topology.  Since you are mapping discrete groups to it, the
topology is irrelevant.  But the small chu category is much more like
hausdorff topological abelian groups (in fact, is equivalent to two full
subcategories of them) and is not abelian for similar reasons.  One take
on this is that separation conditions are more or less incompatible with
effective equivalence relations (= monics are kernels in the additive
case).  And extensionality is incompatible with the dual.
