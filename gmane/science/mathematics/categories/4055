Dear Uwe
You are right in thinking that there should be such=20
an exposition because the construction is explicitly=20
or implicitly involved in so many contexts that a=20
formal summary would be useful. Unfortunately,=20
I know of no such exposition though Hugo Volger=20
started one many years ago.

As you can see from the TAC Reprint of my=20
thesis, the original motivation was to=20
be able to state the definition of adjointness in a=20
wholly elementary way for arbitrary categories=20
without involving enrichments in some fixed
category of sets. If A is a reflective subcategory in=20
some X and if B is coreflective in the same X, then=20
composing the implicit functors yields an adjoint=20
pair between A and B. The point is that conversely=20
any adjoint pair can be so factored through a third=20
"adjunction" category X and the universally available=20
choice has this simple construction as a pullback.
It proved to be the appropriate tool for calculating
Kan extensions, adequacy comonads, fibrations,etc.
Grothendieck defined slice categories and Artin the=20
gluing, both of which are special cases of this
construction.

Although inserters are interdefinable (like equalizers
vs pullbacks), some consider inserters more basic:=20
given x:A->C and y:B->C, one can take the=20
inserter of the two composites AxB->C to obtain=20
the construction under discussion.=20

In the special case A=3DB=3D1 (when the inserter and the=20
"comma" category are the same) we obtain the homset=20
(x,y) of two objects of C. The latter was the reason=20
for my notation: it generalizes a frequent notation for=20
hom.[Recall that every object belongs to a unique=20
category; thus the standard notation C(x,y) is
actually redundant (if C is not enriched), though easier
to understand. Either notation is preferable to the=20
excessive HomsubC, a back formation not be confused
with the informative HomsubR when C arises from=20
adjoining some additional structure R to a given base.]
=20
Concerning the bizarre name:
(1) I had neglected to give the construction any name,=20
so (2) one started giving it a name based on reading=20
aloud the notation: x comma y; (3) some continued
the "name" but changed the notation to a vertical arrow.

Since it is well justified to name a category for its=20
objects, and since the effect of insertion is to create=20
objects with one ingredient more of structure, recent=20
discussions here have proposed the name/notation
             Map(x,y)
[or for emphasis Map(subC)(x,y)]
for the category with its faithful functor to AxB.

Although I often use the word "map" interchangeably
with "morphism", note that the above suggests a more
concrete content: philosophically, in order to confront=20
objects in two categories A and B, it is necessary to=20
first functorially transport them into a common=20
category C. For example to map a 2-truncated simplicial=20
set to a diffentiable manifold (such as a piece of
paper) one first interprets each in appropriate ways as=20
topological spaces, and the resulting objects form a=20
category (having full subcategories of "cartographical"=20
interest). =20

I would be happy to offer a prize for the best exposition!

Bill
