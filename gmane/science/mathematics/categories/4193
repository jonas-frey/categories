                         - Call for Papers -
                          Fifth Workshop on

       MODEL CHECKING and ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (MoChArt-2008)

               At ECAI-2008 - Patras, Greece, July 2008

                http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~mjw/mochart/


INTRODUCTION

Model checking is the process of determining whether or not a formula
of some logic is satisfied by a model for the logic.  For many logics
of interest -- particularly temporal and modal logics -- model
checking procedures can be efficiently automated. This has led to
widespread interest in the use of model checking as a technique for
verifying properties of systems, and the development of a number of
widely used model checking tools (e.g., Carnegie-Mellon's SMV,
Cadence-SMV, and AT&T's SPIN).

The success of model checking in the computer aided verification
community has led to a growth of interest in the use of model checking
in AI. The MOCHART workshop brings together both researchers in AI
with an interest in model checking, and researchers in model checking
who are interested in AI techniques.

Previous editions of the workshop were held in Riva del Garda, Italy
in 2006 (as satellite workshops of ECAI), San Francisco in 2005 (as
satellite workshop of Concur), Acapulco in 2003 (as satellite workshop
of IJCAI03), and Lyon in 2002 (as satellite workshop of ECAI02). We
are exploring the possibility of publishing a formal proceedings after
the event with Springer-Verlag.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Application of model checking techniques to AI problems.
  - planning as model checking
  - model checking for multi-agent systems
  - diagnosis and model checking
  - model checking versus theorem proving

- Model Checking and AI logics.
  - model checking for combined modal/temporal logics
  - model checking for logics of common sense reasoning

- Relations between different techniques used in the two fields for
   similar purposes (e.g., reducing state explosion).

- New model checking techniques specifically for AI problems.

- Exploitation of AI techniques in model checking.
  - AI approaches to the state explosion problem
  - heuristics for model checking
  - AI approaches to automatic abstraction

- Software tools for model checking in AI.
  - languages and software platforms for AI model checking
  - model checking symbolic reasoning systems & languages

- Model checking for verification of AI systems.
  - automated verification of AI systems
  - case studies & experience with model checking in AI

Preliminary papers and papers on applications are strongly encouraged.


IMPORTANT DATES

     Deadline for submissions: April 10th, 2008
     Notification: May 10th, 2008
     Workshop: July 21st-22nd, 2008


SUBMISSION PROCEDURES

Submissions must be formatted according to Springer-Verlag's "Lecture
Notes in Computer Science" styles, and must be no more than 15 pages
in length. Papers must be submitted through the EasyChair web-based
conference management system: follow the link from the workshop web
page. All papers will be peer reviewed, and evaluated on the basis of
relevance, technical quality, significance, evaluation, and
presentation.


PARTICIPATION

The workshop forms part of the ECAI-2008 workshop programme, and as
such delegates must register for the ECAI conference. For full
