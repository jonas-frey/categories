Makkaifest Workshop
18 June 2009
Burnside Hall, McGill University

[Updated information]

We are pleased to announce the following workshop, held at McGill
University, Mathematics Department, on 18 June 2009, in conjunction
with the Makkaifest being held at CRM, 19-20 June 2009, with an
initial reception at the CRM on 18 June.

This workshop is intended for the participants of the Makkaifest. It
will begin at 9am, in Burnside Hall, McGill University, and will
finish around 5pm, so there will be time to get to the reception at
CRM at 6pm. A provisional schedule of talks appears online:

http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/seminar/mf-wkshop.html

(Not all speakers have confirmed their participation, so please check
the webpage for updated information.)

Information about the weather and maps of the area (showing
Burnside Hall) are given on the same webpage.

The workshop will be an informal affair - there will be no
registration, and no "refreshments" (people can buy their own coffee,
and lunch will be "dutch treat"). The workshop is not officially part
of the Makkaifest at the CRM.

If you are interested in attending the workshop, please let us (Phil
Scott or Robert Seely) know so we can be sure we have a room of
suitable size. The themes of the workshop are those of the Makkaifest
itself, and reflect interests shown by Michael Makkai over his career.

Information about the Makkaifest (19-20 June at CRM) may be found on
the meeting website: http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Makkaifest09/

You can register for that meeting online, and if you plan to attend
the meeting banquet on 19 June, please make sure we know (so we can
inform the restaurant of the correct number).
