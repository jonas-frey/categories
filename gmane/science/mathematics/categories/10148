                             Call for Short Contributions

                         The 15th International Workshop on
                   Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science (CMCS'20)
                       Dublin, Ireland, 25 - 26 April 2020
                             (co-located with ETAPS 2020)
                                 www.coalg.org/cmcs20


Objectives and scope
--------------------
Established in 1998, the CMCS workshops aim to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras, their
logics, and their applications. As the workshop series strives to
maintain breadth in its scope, areas of interest include neighbouring
fields as well.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
     approaches);
- coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
     languages, dynamical systems, term rewriting, etc.);
- coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent,
     and constraint) programming;
- coalgebraic data types, type systems and behavioural typing;
- coinductive definition and proof principles for coalgebras (including
     "up-to" techniques);
- coalgebras and algebras;
- coalgebras and (modal) logic;
- coalgebraic specification and verification;
- coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and
     hybrid systems);
- coalgebra in quantum computing;
- coalgebra and game theory;
- tools exploiting coalgebraic techniques.

Venue and event

CMCS'20 will be held in Dublin, Ireland, co-located with ETAPS 2020 on

Submission guidelines
---------------------
Short contributions may describe work in progress, or summarise work
submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere. Accepted short
contributions
will be bundled in a technical report, and are to be presented at the
workshop.
They do not appear in the LNCS postproceedings (which only contain regula=
r
papers). Short contributions should be submitted electronically as a PDF
file
via the Easychair system at

            http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcmcs2020.
