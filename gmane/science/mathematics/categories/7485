Here is a list of people who have announced their intent to attend the
meeting.  People who have asked to talk are starred.  You will notice
that there are 13 people starred and 15 slots above, so we can readily
accomodate 2 more.  By changing the half hour talks to 25 minutes, we
could probably squeeze a couple more in.
