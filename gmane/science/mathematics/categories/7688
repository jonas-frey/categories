Dear all,

Let me first thank the persons who have answered my questions on =
terminology.
Since the answers were different, it seems that the terminology is not =
standard and that my questions made sense.

Preliminary remarks.=20
By now, everybody understands what kind of categories I was talking =
about. they are very simple, one might be tempted to say trivial. But in =
many highly non trivial questions they appear either as "building =
bricks" of more complex constructions (see e.g. fibrations such that all =
the fibers are of that kind), or as special cases, unavoidable, of more =
general situations (e.g. Freyd's notion of "equivalence kernels").
Of course such categories can be "internalized ", say in a topos, (this =
is much too strong), and it would be nice that the terminology should =
fit also the internal case, and in particular any reference, explicit or =
implicit, to AC should be avoided.

1- Discrete versus indiscrete, or coarse, etc. The categories  0 and 1 =
are both discrete and indiscrete So each name night pose a problem. The =
terminology "discrete" is by now well established. Thus I think one =
should avoid "indiscrete" and use "coarse" instead. Thus 0 and 1 are =
discrete and coarse and that is admissible. In the internal case every =
sub object of 1 is both discrete and indiscrete. So "subterminal" is a =
nice name to cover both cases.

2- "Essentially". One has to be careful about this word. It seems to =
mean "up to equivalence". But that depends on what you call "equivalence =
of categories". There is a very strong 2-categorical notion, namely a =
pair of functors  f: A --> B and g: B --> A  with fg and gf isomorphic =
to identities (with or without the adjunction axioms). But it is useless =
for our purpose. The one which might serve here is f full and faithful =
and essentially surjective. But unless we have AC it is not symmetric, =
even for A and B small.=20
Thus with AC we might adopt the suggestions of Thomas and use =
essentially discrete and essential sub terminator. But do we really need =
AC or even any notion of equivalence at all?

3- Elementary remarks.
Let S be a category with finite limits. I want to "internalize" the two =
notions for which I'd like a name, suitable not only when S=3DSet, but =
in general.
(i) if X is an internal category I denote by Ob(X) and Map(X) the =
objects of objects and maps of X and by
d: Map(X) --> Ob(X)xOb(X)  with projections Dom and Codom. When S=3DSet =
if f: x -->y is a map of X, df is the "direction" of f.
X is a preordered object iff d is a mono.=20
It is easy, using the multiplication of X, to express in terms of finite =
limits, the fact that X is a groupoid. Hence equivalence relations are =
definable in any category with finite limits, although composition of =
arbitrary relations is possible only when S is regular. Moreover if F: S =
--> S' is a functor which preserves finite limits and   X is an =
equivalence relation so is F(X)
No essentiality no AC is needed
(ii) the functor  X --> 1 is full and faithful iff the direction map d =
is an iso. This again is preserved by finite limits preserving functors =
F.
(iii) If F preserves finite limits and is faithful it reflects =
equivalence relations and property (ii). In particular the Yoneda =
embedding preserves and reflects the previous properties. this enables =
us to work with them as if S=3DSet. No AC is involved .

For all these reasons I'm not too keen about using "essentially"

I have many more remarks about Fred Linton's and David Robert's postings =
but this mail is already a bit long. So I shall wait a few days before i =
send another mail. By that time I hope to have some reactions to the =
present posting and I shall do my best to answer them.

Best regards, Jean
