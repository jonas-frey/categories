Here are the details of the counterexample mentioned in my earlier
e-mail, for anyone who wants to see them.

Let E be the quasitopos of Frechet spaces (called subsequential
spaces in my paper "On a topological topos"): all you need to
know about this category is that it contains the category S of
sequential spaces as a full subcategory, closed under limits
(not under all colimits, but in fact all colimits that occur in
the following discussion are preserved). All the action takes place
inside S. Let N be the discrete space of natural numbers, and
N+ its one-point compactification N \cup \{\infty\}. Let A be
the space obtained from the disjoint union of two copies of N+
by identifying the two copies of \infty, and let A' be the disjoint
union of N and N+. Clearly, there is a morphism A' \to A which
is bijective on points (hence, both monic and epic) but not an
isomorphism.

However, if we regard A and A' as spaces over N+ in the obvious
way, the morphism A' \to A becomes an isomorphism when we pull
it back along the inclusion N \to N+, and also when we form the
pushouts of

           A x  N -------> A(')
              N+
             |
             |
             v
             N

since both such pushouts are isomorphic to N+. This says that,
if we work in the quasitopos E/N+, the morphism A' \to A is mapped to
an isomorphism in both the open subquasitopos E/N and its closed
"complement".

I should say that I came to consider this question as a result of
a seminar talk today by Pawel Sobocinski, which raised the question
of whether quasitoposes are quasi-adhesive categories. This example
shows that the quasitopos of Frechet spaces is not quasi-adhesive.
