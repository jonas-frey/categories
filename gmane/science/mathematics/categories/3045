Can you explain the "of course" here, please?  What were these reasons,
and do they still hold water? I would have thought that tuples pose
less of an ontological difficulty than functions.

What I meant was cartesian closed category with finite coproducts.

I don't know what you mean - maybe that product types are more similar to
function types than sum types are?  If so, I agree, but I was comparing
function types with sum types, not (function and sum) with (function and
product).
