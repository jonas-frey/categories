[Note from moderator: resent with a subject line]

Dear categorists,
this is a remark about the very first proposition in the "elephant", follow=
ed by some questions.
Lemma 1.1.1 says:

If F is left adjoint to G : D --> C and there is a natural isomorphism=20
FG --> 1_D (not necessarily the counit), then G is full and faithful.

The proof sketched there uses the transfer of the comonad structure via the=
 given iso.=20
Here is an alternative and more explicit proof:

1) By the hypothesis, there are natural isomorphisms
D(-,-) =3D D(FG-,-) =3D C(G-,G-)
so that the bimodule C(G-,G-) : D -|-> D has a biuniversal element
u(x) : Gx --> Gx, for any x in D.

2) By the right and left universality, u(x) is right and left invertible,
so that it is an iso.

3) (Right) universality of u(x) gives bijections
D(x,y) --> C(Gx,Gy) ;=A0 f |--> Gf.u(x)
which factor through the arrow map of G and the composition by u(x);
since the latter is a bijection by 2), the same holds for the former.

Questions:

1) Is this proof correct? Is it "essentially the same" of the one in the bo=
ok?

2) Anyway, the result states that in this case to say that "there is a natu=
ral isomorphism" is equivalent to say that "the canonical natural transform=
ation (the counit) is an iso".
Since many important categorical "exactness" conditions are expressed by re=
quiring that some canonical transformations are iso (e.g. distributivity, F=
robenius reciprocity and so on) one may wonder if also in these cases it is=
 enough to require the existence of a natural isomorphism. I suppose that t=
he answer is negative, but are there simple counter-examples?

Best regards,

Claudio
