Dear Mike,

is the following too simple-minded?

Given a well-founded poset (X,<), a category C and a function F which,
to every functor G from an initial segment of X to C, assigns a cocone
for G.
Then there is a unique functor H:X-->C with the property that for every
x\in X, H(x) is the vertex of the cocone which is F applied to the
restriction of H to {y|y<x}.
