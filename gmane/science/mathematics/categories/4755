Dear Jim,

I think what you did is extremely useful, also because it will make the
views of MR on category theory very clear. My list below contains APCS in
addition to the two journals everybody mentions. It does not contain HHA =
and
JHRS, not because I have anything against them, but because we are
explicitly talking about category theory now (according to your message t=
o
MR).

Dear Andree, Bob, and Bob,

Could you please urgently confirm that you agree to include the journal y=

are taking care of to the list above, and confirm the details I gave?

With best regards to all - George
