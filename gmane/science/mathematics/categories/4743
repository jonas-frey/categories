This remark is quite off-topic for this list, yet may be taken into
account by those members who want to take action about this ranking
issue.

The situation is somewhat similar within other fields of knowledge
and is not limited to science. Indeed, I attended a literature
colloquium a few weeks ago, during which there was a short talk
dealing with this topic.

The speaker, apparently reacting to a decision which applies to
European researchers in his field, described a society in which
researchers, in order to be well-ranked, would ask their relatives
and friends to click frantically on their names and articles in
Google, then pay people to do that fulltime to get higher ranks (in
developing countries to reduce the cost).

A reknown critic and professor, quite influential (at least here in
France), replied that it was perfectly justified to use ranking
methods because these had proved efficient in the field of "pure
sciences". (I do not remember the words she used.) Unfortunately, I
was too abashed to answer.

The reason why I am writing this is that I think researchers should
take interdisciplinary action, if any. Indeed, this issue is more
sociological or political than scientific, and therefore I am not
sure mathematicians have the power to address it on their own.

Regards,

Jonathan
