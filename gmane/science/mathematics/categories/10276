Dear David,

My first reaction when I read your post was that there was an obvious answer=
  of Yes. But the more I reread it, the more I wondered whether I truly under=
stood what the question was. What did you mean by =E2=80=9Ctopos=E2=80=9D? A=
nd what would a =E2=80=9Ctopos object=E2=80=9D be?

Here=E2=80=99s my initial obvious answer.

If =E2=80=9Ctopos=E2=80=9D means elementary topos (optionally with nno), the=
n the theory of toposes is cartesian (aka essentially algebraic), so if =E2=80=
=9Ctopos object=E2=80=9D means =E2=80=9Cinternal topos=E2=80=9D (just as eg =E2=
=80=9Cgroup object=E2=80=9D means =E2=80=9Cinternal group=E2=80=9D), then th=
ere is a standard notion of topos object, model of that cartesian theory, in=
  any 1-category with finite limits. At least, if you take the topos structur=
e to be canonically given.

It seemed too easy. Perhaps you meant something deeper.

First I started to wonder why you stressed the 2-categories. Was it to enabl=
e some up-to-isomorphism laxity?

Next I wondered if I was interpreting =E2=80=9Ctopos object=E2=80=9D correct=
ly. After all, the theory of toposes has two sorts, for objects and arrows, a=
nd an internal topos is carried by two objects. Were you instead thinking of=
  a single object, with its category structure implied by the ambient 2-cells=
? For instance, in a 2-category with finite products, a =E2=80=9Cfinite prod=
uct object=E2=80=9D X could be one for which the diagonals X -> 1 and X -> X=
  x X have right adjoints.

Finally, there is the question of what a =E2=80=9Ctopos=E2=80=9D is. If it i=
s akin to a Grothendieck topos, a category of sheaves for a generalized spac=
e, then then the relevant structure is that not of elementary toposes, but o=
f =E2=80=9Call=E2=80=9D colimits and finite limits as in Giraud=E2=80=99s th=
eorem. I find it a very interesting question when an object in a 2-category m=
ight have topos structure in that sense.

For example, suppose your 2-category C is that of Grothendieck toposes and g=
eometric morphisms (maps). Then the object classifier O surely is a =E2=80=9C=
topos object=E2=80=9D in C, and so also would be O^X for any exponentiable t=
opos X. The points of O^X are the maps X -> O, ie the objects of X, so it is=
  reasonable to imagine that the topos structure of X might be reflected in t=
he C-internal structure on O^X.

Finitary products and coproducts for O, given by maps O^n -> O, are easy. Eg=
  for binary products, n=3D2, map (U, V) |-> UxV. (U, V are points of O, ie s=
ets. The construction is geometric and so does give a geometric morphism.) T=
he infinitary colimits are harder. I conjecture that they are given by M-alg=
ebra structure for O, where M is the symmetric topos monad on C. That should=
  all lift to O^X.

The question with C =3D Grothendieck toposes generalizes to Grothendieck top=
oses over S (bounded S-toposes) and - a particular interest of my own - a re=
lated 2-category based on arithmetic universes.

All the best,

Steve.
