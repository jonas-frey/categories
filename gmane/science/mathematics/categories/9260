Dear David,

MB, with its Kripke-Joyal semantics, is often taken as the "internal
language for toposes", and is indeed good for the whole of the
elementary topos structure. However, there is also a geometric fragment
with an interpretation that does not rely on the subobject classifier.
Predicates are interpreted directly as subobjects, rather than as
morphisms to Omega. n-Lab distinguishes between "Mitchell-Benabou"

   https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Mitchell-B%C3%A9nabou+language

and "internal logic"

   https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal+logic

An advantage of the second kind is that it can be exploited in a much
wider range of structured categories. You can see this done
systematically in Elephant D1.

Since finite limit sketches correspond logically to cartesian theories,
which are geometric, you may find it easier to make the connection using
that second notion of internal logic.

I'm still not sure exactly what you would be trying to prove - I rather
take it for granted that the connection between the category theory and
the internal logic is secure, and you may well find that Elephant D1
provides the answers you want. Apart from that, you may also find my
paper with Palmgren helpful - "Partial Horn logic and cartesian
categories". It is about cartesian theories (hence finite limit
sketches) and shows how to express them in a simple way using
conjunctions and equality in a logic based on Elephant D1 but adapted to
deal with partial terms.

I don't know enough about filter quotients to say anything sensible
about your use of them.

Regards,

Steve.
