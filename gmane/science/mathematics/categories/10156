Dear Colleagues,

It is a great pleasure to let you know that the Editors of Theory and
Applications of Categories have elected a new Managing Editor, Geoff Cruttwell.
Geoff's work as Managing Editor has already begun and the transition has been
very smooth.

As many of you know, Geoff has been a valued colleague of mine at Mount
Allison University since 2012 where he is now a tenured Associate
Professor. Geoff is an experienced and widely published category theorist.
He has collaborated with Canadian and international colleagues, most
recently in developing the theory of tangent categories. I am extremely
grateful that Geoff's regard for community allowed him to accept the
responsibility of the Managing Editor position.

Guiding the first 25 years of TAC with the assistance of our distinguished
editors has been an incredible privilege for me. My thanks go to them and the
many of you who have contributed articles. You have made the job of Managing
Editor a constant pleasure, and I will miss interacting with you.

Best wishes to all,
Bob Rosebrugh
