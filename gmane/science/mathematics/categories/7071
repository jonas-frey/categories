Dear Sebastian,

Here is an elementary categorical introduction to dualities for the
"working mathematician" which you may like to have a look at for the
purpose of preparing your course:

H.-E. Porst, W. Tholen: Concrete dualities. In: Research and Exposition
in Mathematics 18 (Heldermann Verlag, Berlin 1991), pp 111-136.

Best wishes,

Walter
