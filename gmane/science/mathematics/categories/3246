Venue

Kuressaare (pop. 16000) is the main town on Saaremaa (=D6sel), the
second-largest island of the Baltic Sea. Kuressaare is a charming
seaside resort on the shores of the Gulf of Riga highly popular with
Estonians as well as visitors to Estonia.

The scientific sessions of MPC/AMAST 2006 will take place at Saaremaa
Spa Hotel Meri, one among the several new spa hotels in the town. The
social events will involve a number of sites, including the
14th-century episcopal castle and the impact craters of
Kaali. Accommodation will be at Saaremaa Spa Hotels Meri and R=FC=FCtli.

To get to Kuressaare, one normally passes through Tallinn
(pop. 402000), Estonia's capital city. Tallinn is famous for its
picturesque medieval Old Town, inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage
List.

=46rom Tallinn, Kuressaare is easily reached by scheduled coach
(incl. a ferry ride). We may arrange chartered coaches from Tallinn to
Kuressaare and back both for MPC and AMAST, but this depends on the
demand.

There are also twice-daily flights to Kuressaare from Tallinn and
twice-weekly direct flights from Helsinki and Stockholm.


Local organizers

MPC/AMAST 2006 is organized by Institute of Cybernetics, a research
institute of Tallinn University of Technology.
