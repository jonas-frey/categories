, "Computational Category Theory", David Rydeheard and Rod Burstall derive=
=20
an algorithm for unifying terms (in the sense used in logic programming),=
=20
treating it as the construction of coequalisers. (Their original paper, "A=
=20
Categorical Unification Algorithm", is on the Web, but I can only find=20
copies that are locked up behind a Springer paywall.) There are more=20
recent such algorithms, e.g.=20
http://docis.info/docis/lib/goti/rclis/dbl/enitcs/(2002)66%253A5%253C%253AA=
CATUO%253E/www1.elsevier.com%252Fgej-ng%252F31%252F29%252F23%252F120%252F52=
%252F26%252F66.5.004.pdf=20
, "A categorical approach to unification of generalised terms" by Eklund,=
=20
Gal=E1n, Medina, Ojeda-Aciego and Valverde.

My "Excelsior" spreadsheet-modularisation software, described in=20
http://www.j-paine.org/calco2011/paper.html , "Module Expressions for=20
Modularising Spreadsheets and Sharing Code between Them", was inspired by=
=20
category theory, specifically by Joseph Goguen's sheaf semantics for=20
interacting objects.

Goguen has used colimits and 3/2-colimits to model conceptual blending and=
=20
the interpretation of metaphors:=20
http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/pps/taspm.pdf , "Mathematical Models of=20
Cognitive Space and Time".

Michael Healy has used natural transformations and functors as a guide to=
=20
combining neural networks:=20
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=3D10.1.1.32.2635 ,=20
"Category Theory Applied to Neural Modeling and Graphical=20
Representations".

Michael Healy, Thomas Caudell, and Timothy Goldsmith have proposed that=20
compound concepts could be represented as categorical diagrams, and that=20
concepts could be compared by comparing these diagrams. They say that for=
=20
some simple test examples, the results of these comparisons are fairly=20
close to human performance, and that this is therefore worth considering=20
as a mathematical model of human concept representation and comparison:=20
http://repository.unm.edu/handle/1928/6724 , "A Model of Human=20
Categorization and Similarity Based Upon Category Theory".

Ronnie Brown and Tim Porter suggest that higher-dimensional algebra and=20
colimits might be useful for sensoty integration, though they don't=20
develop any algorithms:
http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0306/0306223v1.pdf , "Category Theory=20
and Higher Dimensional Algebra: potential descriptive tools in=20
neuroscience".

Manfred Liebmann has used multicategories and operads as a guide to=20
designing parallel numerical algorithms:=20
http://paralleltoolbox.sourceforge.net/categorytheory.pdf , "Category=20
Theory and the Design of Parallel Numerical Algorithms".

There has been a lot of work on merging ontologies by using categorical=20
constructions, usually pushout and colimit. See e.g. Pascal Hitzler,=20
Markus Kr=F6tzsch, Marc Ehrig, York Sure in=20
http://knoesis.cs.wright.edu/faculty/pascal/resources/publications/cando05.=
pdf,=20
"What Is Ontology Merging? - A Category-Theoretical Perspective Using=20
Pushouts" and Google "combining ontologies categorically".

I once suggested that, via algebraic-specification languages such as=20
CafeOBJ, category theory could be used to guide the construction and=20
modularisation of large Web sites:=20
http://www.j-paine.org/alg_web_spec.html , "Algebraic Web specification".

There's quite a lot of other stuff out there.

I hope these examples fit the spirit of Mike's question. Quite often, it=20
seems that the authors use category theory as a guide, searching it for=20
constructions that they might instantiate as data structures. They then=20
devise algorithms to build these structures. Usually, they do so=20
informally, rather than by formally deriving the algorithm from a=20
categorical definition. Very often, the categorical construction they use=
=20
is a pushout or colimit. That's the impression I have, anyway. So what=20
they're doing is along the lines suggested by Goguen in his "A Categorical=
=20
Manifesto", http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=3D10.1.1.13.36=
2=20
=2E

By the way, in=20
http://www.j-paine.org/dobbs/why_be_interested_in_categories.html , "What=
=20
Might Category Theory do for Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive=20
Science?", I suggest that these two fields are ripe for the plundering of=
=20
apparently unrelated concepts that category theory might be able to unify.
