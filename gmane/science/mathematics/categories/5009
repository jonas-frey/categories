I am sure several other readers of this list will have the same reply
to this specific point of Paul's message:

There is a very nice paper by Lawvere that shows that the essence of
Cantor's theorem is fundamental and beautiful:

   Originally published in: Diagonal arguments and cartesian closed
   categories, Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 92 (1969), 134-145.

There is also a post by Andrej Bauer in his Mathematics and
Computation blog:
