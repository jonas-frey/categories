I (and a colleague) wonder whether what Max Kelly is referring to is
what Brian Day published in an incredibly concise way in pages 4-5 of
the paper "A reflection theorem for closed categories", J. Pure
Appl. Algebra 2 (1972), no. 1, 1--11.

(We would also be interested in having a copy of the version of the
paper "On quotients maps preserved by product and pullback" before the
translation from category theory to topology (referred to in the
deleted part of Kelly's message). Is that still available?)
