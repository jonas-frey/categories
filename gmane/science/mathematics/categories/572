	In an earlier post today I misdescribed a way of axiomatizing
the category of groups by the triple for groups over sets. The point is
that you can axiomatize the category of sets and the Eilenberg-Moore
category for the triple for groups over it, and then identify the 
category of sets with the non-full subcategory of free groups and 
homomorphisms taking generators to generators; so that in a very narrow 
sense you would "only be talking about groups and homomorphisms". But 
really this amounts to defining groups as structured sets.

	What I want to know is, are there known axioms approaching
the category of groups directly.
