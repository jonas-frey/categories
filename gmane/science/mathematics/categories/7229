GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SFM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Formal methods are emerging in computer science as a prominent
approach to the rigorous design of computer, communication and
software systems.

The aim of the SFM series is to offer a good spectrum of
current research in foundations as well as applications of
formal methods, which can be of interest for graduate students
and young researchers who intend to approach the field.

This year SFM is devoted to model-driven engineering and covers
topics such as modeling languages, model transformations, functional
and performance modeling and analysis, and model evolution.


COURSES AND LECTURERS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The school features the following lectures and lab sessions:

  "MDE Basics with a UML Focus"
    Bran Selic (Malina Software Corporation, CA)

  "MDE Basics with a DSL Focus"
    Mark van den Brand (Tech. Univ. Eindhoven, NL)

  "The Object Constraint Language"
    Jordi Cabot (Ecole de Mines de Nantes, FR)

  "Model Transformations"
    Alfonso Pierantonio (Univ. L'Aquila, IT)

  "Graph Transformations"
    Holger Giese (Univ. Potsdam, DE)

  "Abstractions for Behavior Validation"
    Sebastian Uchitel (Imperial College London, UK)

  "Software Performance Modeling"
    Dorina Petriu (Carleton Univ. Ottawa, CA)

  "Model Transformations in Non-Functional Analysis"
    Steffen Becker (Univ. Paderborn, DE)

  "Performance Antipatterns: Modeling and Analysis"
    Vittorio Cortellessa (Univ. L'Aquila, IT)

  "Model Versioning"
    Gerti Kappel (Tech. Univ. Wien, AT)

  "Model Evolution Management"
    Krzysztof Czarnecki (Univ. Waterloo, CA)

  "Formal Specification and Testing of Model Transformations"
    Antonio Vallecillo (Univ. Malaga, ES)

All participants will receive a copy of a tutorial book published by
Springer as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.


LOCATION
^^^^^^^^

SFM-12:MDE will be held in the medieval hilltop town of Bertinoro.

This town is in Emilia Romagna, about 70 km south-east of Bologna,
at an elevation of about 230 m. It can be reached in a couple of
hours from the international airport "G. Marconi" of Bologna by
shuttle (from the airport to the railway station) + train (from
Bologna to Forli`) + bus/taxi (from the railway station to Bertinoro).
The closest airport is the "L. Ridolfi" airport of Forli`, which is
13 km away.

Bertinoro is close to many splendid locations such as Urbino,
Gradara, San Leo, and the Republic of San Marino, as well as some
less well-known locations like the thermal springs of Fratta Terme.

Bertinoro can also be a base for visiting some of the better-known
Italian locations such as Bologna, Rimini, Ravenna, Ferrara, Venezia,
Padova, Verona, Firenze, Pisa, and Siena.

Bertinoro itself is picturesque, with its narrow streets and
walkways winding around the central peak. The school will be held
at the Centro Residenziale Universitario (CRU), an ex-episcopal
fortress that has been converted by the University of Bologna into
a modern conference center with computing facilities and Internet
access. From the fortress, it is possible to enjoy a beautiful vista
stretching from the Apennines to the Adriatic coast and the Alps
over the Po Valley.


ORGANIZATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scientific directors:
* Marco Bernardo         (University of Urbino, IT)
* Vittorio Cortellessa   (University of L'Aquila, IT)
* Alfonso Pierantonio    (University of L'Aquila, IT)

Secretary:
* Monica Michelacci      (CRU Bertinoro, IT)


APPLICATION
^^^^^^^^^^^

Prospective participants should send by 21 March 2012
the application form, available on the school web site,
to the two e-mail addresses below:

  Marco Bernardo
  bernardo AT sti.uniurb.it

  Monica Michelacci
  mmichelacci AT ceub.it

The registration fee is 600 euros and includes the school material.

The accommodation fee is 350 euros and covers the period June 17-24
(7 nights) in double room (to share with another participant),
half board (breakfast and lunch, dinner of June 17 included,
lunch of June 24 excluded).

The reduced accommodation fee for the participants who do not
need a room is 100 euros and covers the period June 18-23
(6 lunches).

A very limited number of grants is available to cover part
of the registration fee (no grant can be requested to cover
the accommodation fee or the travel expenses).

will be communicated by March 31.

Registration to the school is due by April 20.

No refund is possible for cancellation after May 15.
