Of the choices offered here, I like "precarious", "unstable", or
"fragile".  I just thought of "risky" myself.  Good, experienced
mathematicians will know when it's okay to take "risks" (and
will be aware of what the risks are).

"Unstable" seems like a very sober choice, not too likely to
ruffle feathers.

I encourage anyone who cares about this issue to take a look
at the current discussion at the nForum:

D=3D1886

You will see that opinions are divided even among workers in
the nLab.

Dear Juergen,

I agree that we should explore various options.
Strickly speaking, there is no need for a new terminology
since "non-invariant" has been used in the past
and it is working pretty well.

Let me draw a list of potential names.
I have added a few:

non-invariant
equi-unstable
precarious
unstable
fragile
private

I invite everyone to contribute to the list.

Best,
AJ
