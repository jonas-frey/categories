Given any notion of higher category, usually considerable interesting
information is already encoded in the collection of all of these

 - with all suitable morphisms between them

 - and with all suitable invertible transformations and invertible
higher transformations between these.

Notably this is sufficient to talk about equivalence of the higher
categories in question.

In other words, given any notion of higher category, their collection
should at least form an (oo,1)-category.

  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%28infinity%2C1%29-category

This should be the truncation of a more general structure, but should
already contain a considerable amount of the relevant information and
structure.

For various flavors of higher categories the corresponding
(oo,1)-categories "of all of them" are well known. These are
"presented" by what is known as "folk model structures":

 http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/folk+model+structure .

More generally and more recently, Jacob Lurie has used unpublished
work by Clark Barwick to define and study (oo,1)-categories of
collections of (infty,n)-categories for n in N

  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/(infinity,n)-category

One should beware that in practice the difference between the usage
"oo-category" and "omega-category" is usually more due to tradition
than being of intrinsic meaning. Ross Street originally introduced
"omega-category" to explicitly denote a notion where cells of
non-finite degree exist, but later authors didn't stick to that use of
the work.

Compare the remark by Sjoerd Crans that is reproduced here:
