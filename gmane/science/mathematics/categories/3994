It is, IMHO, a pure affectation.  There are a few, very few, English works
that might be improved with an accent (e.g the name "Andre", words like
"preempt" and a handful of others), but "role" is certainly not one of
them.  Another affectation is using "topoi" as the plural of topos.  If
you insist on that, you should use the genetive of "of topos" and the
accusative when it is the direct object--not to mention the vocative when
addressing a topos.
