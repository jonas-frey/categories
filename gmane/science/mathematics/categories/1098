How do you conclude, from the fact that L(infinity) |- "L(n) is consistent", that
L(n) is in fact consistent?

Generally, if T1 |- "T2 is consistent", then to conclude "T2 is consistent",
we use the following argument:  Suppose T2 is inconsistent.  Then
there is some proof by which T2 |- false.  Assuming T1 is strong enough
to formalize the deductive system being used, then it follows
that T1 |- "T2 is inconsistent".   But by hypothesis, T1 |- "T2 is consistent",
therefore T1 is inconsistent.

But this is not a contradiction unless we were already *assuming* the
consistency of T1 !  I.e. it follows from T1+Con(T1) that
if T1 |- Con(T2), then Con(T2), but it does *not* in general
follow from T1 alone.

So the step from
	L(infinity) |- "L(n) is consistent"
to
	L(n) is consistent

cannot be formalized in any obvious way in L(infinity), and therefore
you cannot (again in any obvious way) conclude
L(infinity) |- "L(infinity) is consistent."
