Scope
---------
Studying logics via semantics is a well-established and very active =
branch of mathematical logic, with many applications, in computer =
science and elsewhere. The area is characterised by results, tools and =
techniques stemming from various fields, including universal algebra, =
topology, category theory, order, and model theory. The programme of the =
conference TACL 2015 will focus on three interconnecting mathematical =
themes central to the semantic study of logics and their applications: =
algebraic, categorical, and topological methods. This is the seventh =
conference in the series Topology, Algebra, and Categories in Logic =
(TACL). Earlier instalments of this conference have been organised in =
Tbilisi (2003), Barcelona (2005), Oxford (2007), Amsterdam (2009), =
Marseilles (2011), and Nashville (2013).

Starting from 2013, the conference is preceded by a one-week school.  =
This year the school will be held at the campus of the University of =
Salerno and will include four tutorials, each consisting of 2 hour =
lectures for four days. =20
