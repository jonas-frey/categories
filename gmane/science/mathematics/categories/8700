Dear Noson,

It seems to me it's an oversimplification to say that categories can solve t=
he Halting Problem. There's a logical principle involved.

In your proof on p.23, the central step is that if H: =CF=89 -> 2 is a funct=
or (where =CF=89 and 2 are the posets of natural numbers and {0,1}), then it=
  has a colimit H': 1 -> 2. H(t) describes whether the computation has halted=
  by step t. (By the way, you use =CF=89_i, the indiscreet natural numbers, f=
or the type of t. That's a typo, isn't it? Since 2 is antisymmetric, that wo=
uld imply H is constant.)

Does the colimit exist? That's not a fact of pure category theory, but a log=
ical principle of "omniscience". If you go beyond classical logic (and categ=
ory theory facilitates this) then the colimit might not exist.

For example, it will not work in a topos. To find the colimit you will need t=
o embed 2 in =CE=A9, the poset on the subobject classifier. There you still h=
ave the classical objects 0 and 1 (false and true), but also intermediate ob=
jects corresponding to truth values of other propositions such as "this comp=
utation halts". This switch from 2 to =CE=A9 corresponds to relaxing decidab=
ility to semidecidability - and semidecidability of the halting problem is t=
rivial.

If my calculations are correct, you can see this in the topos of sheaves ove=
r the 1-point compactification of =CF=89. This is the classifying topos for f=
unctors H, and the generic H has no colimit.

An alternative way to understand this is what you see in denotational semant=
ics. Here, when a map to 2 takes the value 0 ("bottom"), that is interpreted=
  as meaning that the assignment of result to argument gets ensnared in a div=
ergence.

Regards,

Steve.
