The following is suggested by Max Kelly's comments and some discussions at
Como.

We have to be prepared for the worst scenario, that blackboard facilities
will get worse, and it may even get to a stage where conference
administrators wonder why mathematicians are not using powerpoint and
computer presentations like everyone else!

People should be aware that Latex facilities for slides are good: just use
\documentclass{slides} \begin{document} \raggedright \begin{slide}
......\end{slide} etc. A  colleague here also got splendid results using
the colour package (I need to investigate this!).

I also like to use in the preamble
\parindent=0pt
\parskip=1ex

and to use almost pidgin English, so that  the impact is visual, with as
few words as possible.

What is not so clear is how to use say animated  gif files in such a
presentation. For this I have used a browser presentation using html files,
and converting tex into html using tth

http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/

I hope this helps people. We could then ask conference centres to provide
projection facilities, if these are a requirement of users.
