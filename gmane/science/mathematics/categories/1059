	Yes, this question is disussed in Kieslers' paper on "Generalized Atomic
Formulas" from the early 1960s. The third name , which I prefer, for the
class is simply "positive" formulas. They are of course a key tool in the
Presentations of a Positive Theory. 
	This may not agree exactly with some
previous uses of the term "positive", since the not-so-innocuous use of
universal prefixes has been eliminated along with the excessive
burden that had been put on the single element "TRUE"; the presentation
machinery for positive theories must involve a BINARY relation of
entailment (for each admitted arity of formula) in place of the single
0-ary relation of provability. This is actually a simplication rather than
a complication although that may not have been clear in the 1930s As far as
 expressive power is concerned, one can say that for Boolean models (as
opposed to models in more general toposes) positive theories are as
general as what have been called "standard presentation first order
theories" : Any particular negation occurring in a presentation of one of
the latter can be replaced by a new primitive relation symbol, nailed to
what it is to negate by the usual pair of lattice (hence positive) new
axioms.
	The geometric role of positive theories is that via
 the classifying-topos construction they provide a standard way
to geometrically visualize models of arbitrary theories via the
 algebraic-geometry paridigm (ie via the body of mathematics created by
Kan, Isbell, Grothendieck, and Yoneda in the decade 1954-1964). Of course,
one of the theories which most interested the model theory pioneers
Birkhoff, Robinson, and Tarski was the theory of commutative rings, so
this extension may seem as natural to us as it did to them.
	Kiesler's paper shows us that the explicit relation between
positivity and preservation under morphisms was recognized clearly quite
a long time ago. Are there papers which also draw the conclusion that the 
"standard" theories and presentations should really be the positive ones,
with negation as a cared-for particular rather than a blanket general ? 
	Whether the possibility of recursive presentability of a given
mathematical concept might vary under this change is not clear to me.(Of
course "quantifier elimination" in some cases changes to an exceptional
"quantifier definability"). Also, the original question concerning whether
(for example) the inclusion, of a positive theory into the associated
theory in the doctrine which has negation and universal quantifiers, is
itself recursive qua inclusion, probably has a negative answer, but I
don't have a reference.
