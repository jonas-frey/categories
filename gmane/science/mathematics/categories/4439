Hi,=0A=
=0A=
we are advertising a lectureship in the Functional Programming Lab in=20=20=
=0A=
Nottingham. Note that the ad mentions "category theory" explicitely=20=20=
=0A=
and we'd like to see applications from people interested in=20=20=0A=
applications of category theory in computer science. While the=20=20=0A=
Functional Programming has been a research topic at Nottingham since=20=20=
=0A=
quite a while, the FP lab as an independent group was only created in=20=20=
=0A=
Autumn last year, see our new webpages=0A=
http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/joomla/=0A=
=0A=
If you have any questions regarding the position (yes, it is a=20=20=0A=
permanent faculty position, the teaching load is reasonable), the=20=20=0A=
group or the location please don't hesitate to contact me. Application=20=
=20=0A=
is online and quite painless. Please remember: the deadline is *15=20=20=0A=
August*.=0A=
=0A=
Cheers,=0A=

Lecturer in Computer Science=0A=
=0A=
Applications are invited for the above post in the School of Computer=20=20=
=0A=
Science.  The successful candidate will be expected to participate in=20=20=
=0A=
the School's teaching activities and contribute to research in the=20=20=0A=
recently formed Functional Programming Laboratory.=0A=
=0A=
Candidates must hold a PhD or equivalent in a relevant subject, have=20=20=
=0A=
an excellent publication record and the ability to teach at=20=20=0A=
undergraduate and postgraduate level.  It is desirable that candidates=20=
=20=0A=
have a track record of external research funding, collaboration across=20=
=20=0A=
disciplines, experience of different types of assessment and higher=20=20=
=0A=
education quality assurance.  They should also have the ability to=20=20=0A=
play a role in the routine running of the School of Computer Science.=0A=
=0A=
The Functional Programming Laboratory covers a broad range of topics=20=20=
=0A=
in the theory, practice, and implementation of functional programming=20=20=
=0A=
languages.  Current interests include type theory, language design,=20=20=
=0A=
program semantics, program verification, modelling and simulation,=20=20=0A=
category theory, programming tools, and quantum programming.=20=20=20=0A=
Applications are welcome from any area that complements existing=20=20=0A=
research strengths in the laboratory.=0A=
=0A=
Salary will be within the range =A330,912 - =A341,545 per annum, depending=
=20=20=0A=
on qualifications and experience (salary can progress to =A348,161 per=20=
