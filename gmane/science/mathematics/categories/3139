Dear all,
	Picking up on the funding issue.  I've served on the
NSF Advisory panel, though many years ago, so I'm familiar with some
of the issues with federal funding.

The worst of it from my experience is that it takes universities
off the hook as to supporting research directly, as opposed to being only
a channel for external funds.  Worse yet, tenure and promotion decisions
are increasingly based on external support (at least in the US)
thus the university doesn't trust its own faculty.

Also involved is a bureaucratic aspect: it's more efficient to
process a large grant with multiple researchers.

In the ``good ole days'', math in the US has essentially NO post-docs.
