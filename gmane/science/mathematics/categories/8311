On page	-15 (yes, a negative page number) of the TAC reprinting of
Abelian Categories (in the 2003 Forward) I wrote:

    The very large category [described] in Exercise 6-A -- with a few
    variations -- has been a great source of counterexamples over the
    years....In its category of abelian-group objects  Ext(A,B)  is a
    proper class iff there???s a non-zero group homomorphism from  A to  B
    (it needn???t respect the actions) hence the only injective object is
    the zero object (which settled a once-open problem about whether
    there are enough injectives in the category of abelian groups in
    every elementary topos with natural-numbers object.
