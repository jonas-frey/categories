Postdoctoral Fellow in Mathematical Logic
Ref. No. SU FV-0346-18

at the Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University.

Closing date: 3 April 2018.

The Department of Mathematics at Stockholm University has roughly 40
faculty members, and is divided into two divisions: Mathematics and
Mathematical Statistics. This postdoctoral position is attached to the
former. The Division of Mathematics carries out research in a wide range
of subjects in pure mathematics, including algebra, analysis,
combinatorics, geometry, logic and topology.

The research group in mathematical logic is active in several areas of
the field including, constructive mathematics, proof theory, type theory
and category-theoretic logic, as well as the philosophical aspects of
logic and mathematics.

Project description

A broad spectrum of different projects within mathematical logic are
possible, but with a preference for projects including type theory, in
particular homotopy type theory, constructive set theory, category
theory and categorical logic, topos theory, point-free topology and
locale theory or other constructive aspects of mathematical logic.

Main responsibilities

The main responsibility is to conduct research. The position also
includes some teaching duties (up to 20 %), which may include
supervision of students. The successful applicant is expected to
participate in activities in the department, in particular by attending
and contributing talks in the logic group???s seminar.

Qualification requirements

Postdoctoral positions are appointed primarily for purposes of research.
Applicants are expected to hold a Swedish doctoral degree (by the time
of appointment) or an equivalent degree from another country.

Assessment criteria

Applicants with a PhD degree awarded no more than three years before the
deadline for application will be given preference. Parental leave,
compulsory military and similar types of service, or longer periods of
illness are not counted towards these three years.

In the appointment process, special attention will be given to research
skills. Emphasis will also be placed on the candidate???s potential to
contribute to the proposed research program and to interact with other
members of the department.

Terms of employment

The position involves full-time employment for a maximum of two years,
with the possibility of extension under special circumstances. Start
date is 2018-09-01 or as per agreement.

Contact

Further information about the position can be obtained from Professor
Erik Palmgren, telephone: +46 8 16 45 32, palmgren@math.su.se, and/or
Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine, telephone: +46 8 1614 66, p.l.lumsdaine@math.su.se.
