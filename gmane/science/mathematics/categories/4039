	Well, I suppose that whether or not this is an accidental bug (and
remember, as a famous corollary of Occam's Razor tells us, we should
never put down to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity)
it will be a short enough time before somebody finds out how Distiller
codes these glyphs and publicises it; and one upgrade after that before
everybody's DVI->PDF utility follows suit. This does not strike me as a
game that Adobe could play for long witout wrecking compatibility with
their *own* software.

	Alternatively, one could presumably remap the glyphs so that Acrobat 8
didn't realize what it was displaying.

	Fair enough, though dvi has its own "intellectual property" problems
with glyphs that the end user doesn't have a copy of.  Not such a
problem with TAC, I admit, but...
