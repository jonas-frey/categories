A full-time PhD scholarship is available in the Department of
Mathematics, Macquarie University.

Please quote the allocation reference number 2010113 on your application
form.

Project Name: Functorial operadic calculus

Project Description: The project aims to develop mathematical tools to
handle higher dimensional algebraic theories. Many important conjectures
in different areas of mathematics should follow naturally once an
adequate language of higher dimensional operads is developed. An ideal
candidate is expected to have some background in category theory,
algebraic topology or algebraic geometry.

For further discussion regarding the project, applicants are encouraged
to contact the supervisor, Dr Michael Batanin; email
mbatanin@science.mq.edu.au Phone +61-2-98508926.

The 2010 MQRES full-time stipend rate is $A 22,500 pa tax exempt for 3.5
years.

Applicants will need to complete a candidature/scholarship application
form and arrange for two academic referee reports to be submitted to the
Higher Degree Research Office. Refer to:
http://www.hdr.mq.edu.au/information_about/applications for further
application instructions. Macquarie University will advise the
successful applicant of entitlements at the time of scholarship offer.
Please quote the allocation number on your application.
