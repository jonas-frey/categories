There is. First consider the full subcategory of partitions; that is,
sets whose elements happen to be non-empty, pairwise disjoint sets. It
has an obvious choice of quotient maps that does the trick, namely
those maps for which each element of the target is the union of its
fibre. For the remaining sets as sources, additionally choose the
identity in case of the trivial quotient, the canonical map otherwise.
