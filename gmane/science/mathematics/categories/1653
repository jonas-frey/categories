   New book! 
   G. Stefanescu, Network Algebra, 
   Springer-Verlag, London/Berlin/...

   ISBN: 1-85233-195-X; XVI+402pp; 
   GBP 37.50; softcover; April 2000

   Network Algebra considers the algebraic study of networks
   and their behaviour. It contains general results on the
   algebraic theory of networks, recent results on the
   algebraic theory of models for parallel programs, as well as
   results on the algebraic theory of classical control
   structures. The results are presented in a unified framework
   of the calculus of flownomials, leading to a sound
   understanding of the algebraic fundamentals of the network
   theory. Network Algebra will be of interest to anyone
   interested in network theory or its applications and
   provides them with the results needed to put their work on a
   firm basis. Graduate students will also find the material
   within this book useful for their studies.
