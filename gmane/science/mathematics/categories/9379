Dear Anne,=20

I join you in your grief to have lost one of the most prominent members of =
our group and someone whom I have known since the early days when I present=
ed my thesis at an Oberwolfach meeting in 1966 then meeting the entire Samm=
y-gang. My condolences extend to Hanne and their grandchildren. I knew from=
  her how brave Myles has been in face of his devastating illness. He has my=
  profound admiration as do you. He will never be forgotten. Only today I wa=
s communicating to others my very old paper on topos theory and the indepen=
dence of Souslin hypothesis which was greatly influenced by Myles having de=
alt beautifully with the topos proof for the independence of of CH after Pa=
ul Cohen, just as mine was influenced by one by Stanley Tennembaum. This wa=
s not the only influence that Myles has had on me. His forcing topologies l=
ed to my construction of the symmetric topos of =C2=A0the Lawvere distribut=
ions classifier and of course much much more. I will miss him. This is a ve=
ry bad year for us category theorists.=20

Best wishes=20
Marta

Dear collegues,

A very sad news: my friend and collaborator Myles Tierney passed away this =
morning
at home in New Jersey after a long illness. His wife Anne Bergeron was with=
   him.
He had turned 80 years old last month.

I will write later about his contributions to category theory, his fields.
