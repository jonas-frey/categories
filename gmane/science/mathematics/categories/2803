Hi,

Please post the following note from the UB Mathematics Department (not
me).

Since postings on the catnet have sought further information on the memorial for
John Isbell, the Mathematics Department of the University at Buffalo, SUNY would
like to assure the community that the service and announcements were handled
according to the wishes of the family.  The service itself was held on Saturday
afternoon and remarks about John's remarkable intellectual breadth and extensive
mathematical accomplishments were made by Professors J. Duskin, F.W. Lawvere, S.
Schanuel, and S. Williams.  The family is preparing an obituary, with more
detail than the death notice copied to the catnet by F. Linton, and we will
forward it to the catnet when it appears.
