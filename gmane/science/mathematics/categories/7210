Dear List,

We are pleased to announce an upcoming three day workshop intended to
bring together young (mainly postdoctoral and graduate student)
researchers in representation theory and related fields with a focus
on exciting new developments in algebraic and geometric methods.  The
meeting will be held at the University of Toronto on May 7-9, 2012 and
will incorporate both a graduate student workshop and a research level
conference. The workshop component will consist of a series of three
lectures by Ben Webster (Northeastern) explaining S-duality. In
addition to these lectures, there will be research talks given by the
leading young researchers in representation theory and related fields.
  A list of speakers can be found on the workshop webpage.

The Fields Institute is funding the workshop so there will be some
available funding for travel.  Registration and applications for
funding will be open shortly.  See the workshop webpage for details:

http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/11-12/reptheory2012/

Also, an nLab page has been started to give some background on Braden,
Licata, Proudfoot, and Webster's notion of S-duality (or symplectic
duality) that will be the topic of Webster's lectures:

We hope to see you there.

Best,
