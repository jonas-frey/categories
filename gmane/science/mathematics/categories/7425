Dear colleagues=2C



I have received quite a few requests of some of my papers lately=2C so I de=
cided to make them accessible (full text) in the site=20



https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marta_Bunge/



There are several papers which I could not access for copyright or other re=
asons=2C but they are nevertheless listed with citation. I could scan some =
of them if anybody interested cannot access the journals in which they appe=
ared.=20


Regards=2C


Marta Bunge=20
