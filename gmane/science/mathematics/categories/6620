                                 PhD Position
                                        in
       Category Theory and Functional Programming

       Department of Computer and Information Science
            University of Strathclyde, Scotland


Applications are invited for one PhD position within the Mathematically =
Structured Programming group at the University of Strathclyde. The group =
comprises Prof. Neil Ghani, Dr. Patricia Johann, Dr. Conor McBride, Dr. =
Peter Hancock, Dr. Robert Atkey, and five PhD students. The PhD project =
centers around applications of categorical methods to functional =
programming languages. The project is under the direction of Patricia =
Johann.

The successful applicant will have either a first-class degree or an MSc =
in Mathematics or Computing Science or a related subject with a strong =
Mathematics or Computing Science component. Ideally, they will also have =
a strong, documented interest in doing research. Strong mathematical =
background and problem-solving skills are essential; good programming =
skills are a plus. Prior knowledge of category theory and/or functional =
programming is an advantage, but is not required.

The PhD position is for 3 years; it starts early October of 2011. The =
position is a fully-funded post for a UK or EU student, and includes =
both coverage of fees and an EPSRC-level stipend for each of the three =
years.

More information about the department is available at

        http://www.strath.ac.uk/cis

The University of Strathclyde (http://www.strath.ac.uk) is located in =
the heart of Glasgow, which Lonely Planet Travel Guides hail as "one of =
Britain's largest, liveliest and most interesting cities" (see =
http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/scotland/glasgow/). Southern =
Scotland provides a particularly stimulating environment for researchers =
in theoretical computer science, with active groups in this area at =
Heriot-Watt University, the University of Edinburgh, the University of =
Glasgow, the University of St. Andrews, and the University of =
Strathclyde.

Requests for further information and other informal enquiries can be =
sent to:

                 Patricia Johann
         patricia at cis.strath.ac.uk

Those interested in the position are asked to send e-mail to the address =
given above in the next week, since there is a very short deadline for =
this position.
