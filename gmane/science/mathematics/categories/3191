Dear Bill,

Congratulations on your posting, particularly in what refers to Mac Lane,
which is very revealing.

>	When Saunders Mac Lane penned his hard-hitting 1997 Synthese

>would just go away. But Saunders was aware of the seriousness of the
>threat, which indeed is still here with greater determination.
>Although the title of that article was "Despite physicists, proof is

>gave themselves license to insult generations of scrupulously serious

In case there may be somebody not acquainted with MacLane's excellent
article, here is a link to it:

I suppose that you cannot (or do not want to) be more explicit.  I do not
know (for the most part) which articles you are referring to.

Best wishes,
Marta
