                         CALL FOR PAPERS

                Thirtieth Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on
                  LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (LICS)

                   July 6=E2=80=9310, 2015, Kyoto, Japan

                 http://lics.rwth-aachen.de/lics15/

VENUE

LICS 2015 will be hosted in Kyoto, Japan during the week 6-10 July
2015 and will be colocated with ICALP 2015.


SCOPE

The LICS Symposium is an annual international forum on theoretical and
practical topics in computer science that relate to logic, broadly
construed. We invite submissions on topics that fit under that rubric.

Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest include: automata
theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,
concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,
constructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,
description logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects
of program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,
higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic,
logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming, logical aspects
of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational complexity,
logical aspects of quantum computation, logical frameworks,  logics of
programs, modal and temporal logics, model checking, probabilistic
systems, process calculi, programming language semantics, proof
theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security and privacy,
rewriting, type systems and type theory, and verification.


IMPORTANT DATES

Authors are required to submit a paper title and a short abstract of
about 100 words in advance of submitting the extended abstract of the
paper. The exact deadline time on these dates is given by AoE
(anywhere on earth).

Titles & Short Abstracts Due:     January  12, 2015
Extended Abstracts  Due:           January 19, 2015
Author feedback/rebuttal period:  March 12-16, 2015
Author Notification:                 March 30, 2015
Final Versions Due for Proceedings:  April 27, 2015

Deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be considered. All
submissions will be electronic via
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlics2015.


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Every extended abstract must be submitted in the IEEE Proceedings
2-column 10pt format and may not be longer than 12 pages, including
references. LaTeX style files are available on the conference website.

The extended abstract must be in English and provide sufficient detail
to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper.  It
should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the
main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and
relevance to the conference and to computer science, all phrased for
the non-specialist. Technical development directed to the specialist
should follow. References and comparisons with related work must be
included. (If necessary, detailed proofs of technical results may be
included in a clearly-labeled appendix, to be consulted at the
discretion of program committee members.) Extended abstracts not
conforming to the above requirements will be rejected without further
consideration. Paper selection will be merit-based, with no a priori
limit on the number of accepted papers. Papers authored or co-authored
by members of the program committee are not allowed.

Results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia or workshops.
The program chair must be informed, in advance of submission, of any
closely related work submitted or about to be submitted to a
conference or journal.

Authors of accepted papers are expected to sign copyright release
forms.  One author of each accepted paper is expected to present it at
the conference.


SHORT PRESENTATIONS

A session of short presentations, intended for descriptions of student
research, works in progress, and other brief communications, is
planned. These abstracts will not be published. Dates and guidelines
will be posted on the conference website.


KLEENE AWARD FOR BEST STUDENT PAPER

An award in honor of the late Stephen C. Kleene will be given for the
best student paper(s), as judged by the program committee.


SPECIAL ISSUES

Full versions of up to three accepted papers, to be selected by the
program committee, will be invited for submission to the Journal of
the ACM. Additional selected papers will be invited to a special issue
of Logical Methods in Computer Science.


SPONSORSHIP

The symposium is sponsored by ACM SIGLOG and the IEEE Technical
Committee on Mathematical Foundations of Computing, in cooperation
with the Association for Symbolic Logic and the European Association
for Theoretical Computer Science.
