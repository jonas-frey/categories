                           CALCULEMUS-2000
                  Symposium on the Integration of
             Symbolic Computation and Mechanized Reasoning
                            6-7 August 2000
                          St Andrews, Scotland
                      (collocated with ISSAC 2000)

SCOPE

Both deduction systems and computer algebra systems are receiving
growing attention from industry and academia. On the one hand,
mathematical software systems have been commercially very
successful. Their use is now wide-spread in industry, education, and
scientific contexts. On the other hand, the use of formal methods in
hardware and software development has made deduction systems
indispensable not least because of the complexity and sheer size of
the reasoning tasks involved.  As many application domains fall
outside the scope of existing deduction systems and computer algebra
systems, there is still need for improvement and in particular need
for the integration of computer algebra and deduction systems.

The symposium is intended for researchers and developers interested in
combining the reasoning capabilities of deduction systems and the
computational power of computer algebra systems.


TOPICS 

Topics of interest for the symposium include all aspects related to the
combination of deduction systems and computer algebra systems. We
explicitly encourage submissions of results from applications and case
studies where such integration results are particularly important.


FORMAT

The symposium will feature invited talks, contributed presentations
with ample time for discussion, and a panel session.

Consistent with the tradition of the symposium as a lively forum for
discussing controversial ideas, we expect and encourage contributed
talks to present work in progress, rather than polished final results.


INVITED SPEAKERS

- Henk Barendregt, U. Nijmegen, Mathematics and Computer Science
- Arjeh Cohen, Eindhoven University of Technology, Dept. Math. 
- Gaston Gonnet, ETH Z"urich, Institute for Scientific Computation
  

SUBMISSION

Authors are invited to submit papers in the following categories: 

- Full papers up to 15 pages describing original results not
  published elsewhere.
- System descriptions of up to 5 pages describing new systems or
  significant upgrades of existing ones, especially including
  experiments.

Details of the submission format will be available from the web page
(see top) closer to the deadline.

Authors of accepted full papers and system descriptions are expected
to present their contribution at the symposium. Authors of system
descriptions are expected to demonstrate their systems.

The symposium will have published proceedings, the organizers are
currently negotiating with major publishers. The results and details
will be published at the web page together with the submission
specification.
