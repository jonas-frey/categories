 Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop
 bringing together researchers in mathematics and computer science with
 a focus on the application of category theory in computer science.

 This year's meeting will be hosted in the Department of Mathematics
 and Statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.

 There will be an informal welcome reception in the evening of May 29.
 The scientific program starts on May 30, and consists of a day of
 tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to category theory, as well
 as a day and a half of research talks. The meeting ends at mid-day on
 June 1.

 FMCS 2008 takes place one week after MFPS 2008 (which will be held at
 the University of Pennsylvania). We hope that this will enable and
 encourage participants from overseas to attend both conferences!
