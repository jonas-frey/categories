Dear categories-subscribers,

Following the recent discussion of iBourbaki and related ideas on this
list, you (or your students) may be interested  in the following jobs
being advertised in our Foundations group at Nijmegen:

1 Postdoc and 1 PhD vacancy in the MathWiki project

Please contact Herman Geuvers <herman@cs.ru.nl>  directly if interested.

====================================================

1 POSTDOC and 1 PHD POSITION in the MathWiki project

          at Radboud University Nijmegen (NL)

          http://www.fnds.cs.ru.nl/fndswiki/Vacancies

The Institute for Computing and Information Science of the Radboud
University Nijmegen (NL) is looking for 2 researchers to work on the NWO
project "MathWiki a Web-based Collaborative Authoring Environment for
Formal Proofs".

The vacancies are:

- a POSTDOC for the period of 3 years
vacancy number: 62-16-09


- a PHD POSITION for the period of 4 years
vacancy number: 62-17-09

AIMS OF THE PROJECT
===================
The aim of the MathWiki project is to open up to a wider community the
rich collections of knowledge stored in the repositories of proof
assistants.

To this end we will build a web-based collaborative authoring
environment for formal mathematics, the MathWiki system. This system
will provide interactive web access through a standardized interface to
a number of proof assistants. The MathWiki system will also be a
platform for the development of formal proofs within those proof
assistants and it will provide high level access (through Wikipedia-like
web pages) to their repositories of formalised mathematics. These
repositories will reside on the server.

In the project we will study and further develop Wiki technology and
semantic web technology, all in the context of proof assistant
repositories of formalized mathematics. The project thus brings together
the open nature of Wiki authoring with expertise in Proof Assistants and
Semantic Web technologies to build a new Wiki for mathematics,
supporting content creation, search and retrieval.

>From the perspective of the ordinary user of mathematics, MathWiki will
be important because it will provide high-level mathematical content on
the web in a much more coherent and precise way than is available at
present.

>From the proof assistant user perspective, MathWiki will be important
because it will provide an advanced environment for the collaborative
authoring of verified mathematics, mediated simply by a web interface.

The MathWiki system will be based on our existing experience with proof
assistant technology on the web, the "ProofWeb" systems, see
