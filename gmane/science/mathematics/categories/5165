My understanding of this ancient terminology ids that a replete subcategory=
 is one that is closed under the forming of isomorphic copies.A subcategory=
 which contains an isomorphic copy of every object in the containing catego=
ry is called skeletal
A subcategory ois both replete and skeletal if and only if it contains all =
objects of the larger category.

One adjective that *had* been used for such a subcategory
(whether small, or full, or not) was "replete". I'll defer
to others on the question of whether that terminology is
still in use today, or is ... um ... *deprecated* :-) .
