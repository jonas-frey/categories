I copy an old post in the list that may be of interest to the present matter
and that I had saved by curiosity but not acted upon afterwards.

________________________________________________________________________
this is to tell, or remind, readers about the Web-based interactive
category-theory demonstrations I have on my site. Perhaps of interest to
new students now an academic year is starting. They're at
http://www.j-paine.org/cgi-bin/webcats/webcats.php . After some preamble,
this page contains a form divided into sections. Each section generates a
particular construct in the category of finite sets: e.g. a colimit,
equaliser, or initial object. You can input sets and arrows, or let the
demo choose its own. The output includes a diagram, and text explaining
it.

Cheers,
