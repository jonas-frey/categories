Hi David,

Sure. Once you establish

>(1) CAlg(V) admits finite coproducts, and the forgetful functor CAlg(V) --=
> V canonically enhances to a symmetric monoidal functor (CAlg(V),=E2=88=90=
) --> (V,=E2=8A=A0).

in some way, the Eckmann=E2=80=93Hilton argument shows that
the multiplication map A=E2=8A=A0A --> A is canonically equivalent to the
underlying map of the codiagonal map A=E2=88=90A --> A in CAlg(V), hence

>(2) Using the notation (1'), for any A,B=E2=88=88CAlg(V), there is a canon=
ical enhancement of the multiplication map A=E2=8A=A0A --> A from a morphis=
m in V to a morphism in CAlg(V).

Thanks for sharing this.

Incidentally, when I previously wrote

> associating C^S x C^S to S.

I of course only meant that there will be such a symmetric monoidal
functor (where the association S ---> C^S x C^S then does not say
more than that the one point set goes to C x C), but NOT that there
is a functor S ---> C^S x C^S before having a symmetric monoidal
structure on C x C. I'm sorry about the imprecision.

Best regards,
Takuo
