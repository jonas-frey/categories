Dear Categorists -

I made some mistakes in my account of Cheng's work, saying "monad
on a category" at some points where I should have said "monad in
a 2-category".  Here's a fixed version:

 Street noted that we can talk about monads, not just in the
 2-category of categories, but in any 2-category.  I actually
 explained monads at this level of generality back in "week89".
 Indeed, for any 2-category C, there's a 2-category Mnd(C) of
 monads in C.

 And, he noted that a monad in Mnd(C) is a pair of monads in C
 related by a distributive law!

 That's already mindbogglingly beautiful.  According to Eugenia,
 it's practically the last sentence of Street's paper.  But in
 her new work:

 18) Eugenia Cheng, Iterated distributive laws, available as
 arXiv:0710.1120.

 she goes a bit further: she considers monads in Mnd(Mnd(C)),
 and so on.   Here's the punchline, at least for today: she shows
 that a monad in Mnd(Mnd(C)) is a triple of monads F, G, H related
 by distributive laws satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation:

              \F G/   |H     F|  G\   /H
               \ /    |       |    \ /
                /     |       |     /
               / \    |       |    / \
              /   \   |       \   /   \
             |     \ /         \ /     |
             |      /     =     /      |
             |     / \         / \     |
             |    /   \       /   \    |
             \   /    |       |    \   /
              \ /     |       |     \ /
               /      |       |      /
              / \     |       |     / \
             /H  \G   |F     H|   G/   \F

 This is also just what you need to make the composite FGH
 into a monad!

 By the way, the pathetic piece of ASCII art above is lifted
 from "week1", where I first explained the Yang-Baxter equation.
 That was back in 1993.  So, it's only taken me 14 years to learn
 that you can derive this equation from considering monads in
 the category of monads in the category of monads in a 2-category.

Also, I should have given a reference to earlier work on Gelfand
duality in a topos:

 Bernhard Banachewski and Christopher J. Mulvey, A globalisation
 of the Gelfand duality theorem, Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 137 (2006),
 62-103.  Also available at
 http://www.maths.sussex.ac.uk/Staff/CJM/research/pdf/globgelf.pdf

 They show that any commutative C*-algebra A in a Grothendieck topos is
 canonically isomorphic to the C*-algebra of continuous complex functions
 on the compact, completely regular locale that is its maximal spectrum
 (that is, the space of homomorphisms f: A -> C).  Conversely, they show
 any compact completely regular locale X gives a commutative C*-algebra
 consisting of continuous complex functions on X.
