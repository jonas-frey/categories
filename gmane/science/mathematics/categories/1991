Dear All 
I replied to Bill Rowan directly yesterday but it now seems that others
might be interested in my reply so here it is.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

In my book with Cordier, the result you want is Proposition 4 p 42 (The
book is :Categorical Shape Theory, Cordier and Porter, Published by
Ellis Horwood, 1989).  The result is known to some shape theorists as
the Mardesic trick as Sibe Mardesic is thought to have found it, but I
seem to remember seeing a version of it in Grothendieck's work (SGA4 and
earlier) If you can get a copy of our book there is a reasonably
categorical treatment of pro categories.   
   Best wishes,

Tim Porter
