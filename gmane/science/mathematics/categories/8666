I just received Patrik Eklund's message containing the statement "Yet,
G=C3=B6del uses "provability" to create new sentences, and simply opens up =
that
bag of sentences, and throws in these new ones."  Presumably others have
already responded to this in messages that haven't yet reached me, but,
just in case they haven't: Much of the work in G=C3=B6del's paper on the
incompleteness theorems is devoted to making sure that what Eklund wrote
here is not the case.  G=C3=B6del shows how statements about provability ca=
n be
encoded as arithmetical statements, which are not at all new but were
available (in what Eklund calls "that bag") all along.
