                               Call for Papers

         14th Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation
                               (WoLLIC'2007)
                          Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
                              July 2-5, 2007

    WoLLIC is an annual international forum on inter-disciplinary research
    involving formal logic, computing and programming theory, and natural
    language and reasoning.  Each meeting includes invited talks and
    tutorials as well as contributed papers.

    The Fourteenth WoLLIC will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from
    July 2 to July 5, 2007, and sponsored by the Association for Symbolic
    Logic (ASL), the Interest Group in Pure and Applied Logics (IGPL),
    the European Association for Logic, Language and Information
    (FoLLI), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science
    (EATCS), the Sociedade Brasileira de Computacao (SBC), and the
    Sociedade Brasileira de Logica (SBL).

PAPER SUBMISSION
    Contributions are invited on all pertinent subjects, with particular
    interest in cross-disciplinary topics.  Typical but not exclusive
    areas of interest are: foundations of computing and programming;
    novel computation models and paradigms; broad notions of proof and
belief;
    formal methods in software and hardware development; logical approach to
    natural language and reasoning; logics of programs, actions and
resources;
    foundational aspects of information organization, search, flow, sharing,
    and protection.
    Proposed contributions should be in English, and consist of a scholarly
    exposition accessible to the non-specialist, including motivation,
    background, and comparison with related works.
    They must not exceed 10 pages (in font 10 or higher), with up to
    5 additional pages for references and technical appendices.
    The paper's main results must not be published or submitted
    for publication in refereed venues, including journals and other
    scientific meetings.
    It is expected that each accepted paper be presented at the meeting by
    one of its authors.
    Papers must be submitted electronically at
    www.cin.ufpe.br/~wollic/wollic2007/instructions.html
    A title and single-paragraph abstract should be submitted by
    February 23, and the full paper by March 2 (firm date).
    Notifications are expected by April 13, and final papers for
    the proceedings will be due by April 27 (firm date).

PROCEEDINGS
    Proceedings, including both invited and contributed papers,
    will be published in advance of the meeting.
    Publication venue: Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
