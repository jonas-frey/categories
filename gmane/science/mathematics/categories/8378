Hi Claudio

yes, I know this. One can prove it from Freyd's characterisation of N
by finite colimits, as I hinted in my first message. What I'm after is
the other situation, when the direct image functor preserves the NNO.
I believe the geometric morphism being local is enough, but much more
than needed, so I was after weaker/alternative conditions.
