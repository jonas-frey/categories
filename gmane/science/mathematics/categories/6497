Dear George, I do not think that the answer to Andrej Bauer question is
trivial, as a matter of fact it is not trivial at all. Andrej or any other
able mathematician does not have to know that GBA is equivalent to BA/2.
Furthermore, I feel that Fred Linton bringing into consideration the analogy
with C* algebras is pointing to Andrej some relevant mathematical questions.

greetings  e.d.
