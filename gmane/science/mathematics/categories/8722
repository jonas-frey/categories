COORDINATION 2016

18th IFIP International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages
A DisCoTec Member Conference

http://coordination2016.discotec.org/

June 6-8, 2016, Heraklion, Greece


IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract Submission: February 1, 2016
Paper Submission: February 8, 2016
Author Notification: March 21, 2016
Camera ready copy: April 4, 2016
Early registration: May 9, 2016
Conference: June 6-8, 2016

The time of all deadlines is 24:00 AoE (UTC-12).


SCOPE

COORDINATION 2016 is the premier forum for publishing research results and =
experience reports on software technologies for collaboration and coordinat=
ion in concurrent, distributed, and complex systems. The key focus of the c=
onference is the quest for high-level abstractions that can capture interac=
tion patterns and mechanisms occurring at all levels of the software archit=
ecture, up to the end-user domain. COORDINATION 2016 seeks high-quality con=
tributions on the usage, study, formal analysis, design, and implementation=
  of languages, models, and techniques for coordination in distributed, conc=
urrent, pervasive, and parallel software-intensive computing systems. COORD=
INATION 2016 seeks as well to adapt and integrate traditional COORDINATION =
techniques in the realm of multi-agent systems (MAS), which typically invol=
ve more coarse-grained (cognitive, intelligent, goal-oriented) components.

Main topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but=
  not limited to) coordination related aspects of:

* Models and paradigms
* Programming abstractions and languages
* Foundations, types and semantics
* Specification and verification
* Middlewares and architectures
* Distributed, mobile and networked computing
* Parallel and high-performance computing
* Nature- and bio-inspired approaches
* Self-adaptation, self-organisation and autonomic computing
* Collective systems, ensembles, federations, and systems-of-systems
* Teamwork, distributed problem solving and collective intelligence
* Multiagent systems, auction, negotiation, argumentation, and rational age=
nts
* Trust, policies, reputation and security
* Applications and case studies


SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

We solicit papers describing thorough and complete research results and/or =
experience reports on applications and cases studies of coordination. The c=
onference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS Series.

Contributions must be written in English and report on original, unpublishe=
d work not submitted for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP's codes of conduct=
). The submissions must not exceed 16 pages in length, including figures an=
d references, prepared using Springer's LNCS style. Submissions not adherin=
g to the above specified constraints may be rejected without review.

Papers should be submitted as PDF or PS via EasyChair:
   https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcoordination2016


POST-PROCEEDINGS PUBLICATION

Relevant, high-quality papers will be invited to a special issue of a highl=
y reputed journal. Previous special issues are under preparation within the=
  journal on Logical Methods in Computer Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org=
/).
