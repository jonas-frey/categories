OK, that's pretty much what I thought.

I hope you won't mind if I take this opportunity to ask something
that I've been idly wondering about ASD lately,
and which is related to this thread (even the Cantor set).
That is: to what extent does ASD have inductive and coinductive objects;
in other words: to what extent do polynomial functors
have initial algebras and final (terminal) coalgebras?

Of course, N is put in by hand as the initial algebra of X |-> 1 + X.
And I know that you've constructed Cantor space as 2^N
(through a bit of argument since exponentials don't always exist)
and the proof that this is the final coalgebra of X |-> 2 x X goes throug=
h.
But the final coalgebra of X |-> N x X would be Baire space,
which is not locally compact, so we don't expect that to work.

My intuition is that polynomials with overt discrete coefficients
should have overt discrete initial algebras,
while those with compact Hausdorff coefficients
should have compact Hausdorff final coalgebras.
Have you any thoughts about that question?

I'd be interested to hear if anybody has done ~any~ work on the second:
intensional type theory without identity types.
It seems to me to work if done in the style of Thierry Coquand
(with inductive types and dependent products as the main constructions)
but not if done in the style of Per Martin-L=C3=B6f
(with W-types and dependent and finitary products and sums).

I should probably say something about what categories
would serve as syntactic models of such a type theory,
but I never fully worked that out.
