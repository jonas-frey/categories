The reference you are looking for is Cartesian Bicategories II by
Carboni, Kelly, Walters, and Wood.  Here is a link to the .pdf on the
TAC homepage.

> Dear List,

> The weakest form of limits in a bicategory are defined by equivalences of
> hom-categories in place of the slightly more strict version defined by
> isomorphisms.  Then the process of defining a monoidal structure on a
> bicategory with finite products takes on a slightly different flavor in each
> case.
>
> In the weak case, given a pair of 1-cells one must *choose* a monoidal
> product, whereas in the latter case, a *unique choice* of monoidal product
> can be obtained from the one-dimensional aspect of the universal property.
>
> I would guess that in the former case, one should not worry too much about
> how to choose the product 1-cells, since the universal property will come to
> the rescue when checking that one has indeed defined a monoidal structure on
> the bicategory.

> Does anyone know of a reference which proves something along these lines?
