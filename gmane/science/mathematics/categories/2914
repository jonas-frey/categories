Actually it is an RA (Relation Algebra) tradition dating back to the
19th century.  In my LICS'92 evening history talk, "Origins of the
Calculus of Binary Relations", http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/ocbr.pdf, I
attributed it as follows.

I still don't know whether RA played any role in the adoption of ; by
Algol 60.  However Algol 60 used ; not as a statement terminator (as in
C or Java) but as an associative infix operator between statements,
suggestive of RA influence.  (Perhaps so as not to overly inconvenience
those who tended to think of semicolon as a terminator anyway, the empty
string was permitted as a statement, inadvertently complicating the task
of generating the language Algol 60 with an unambiguous context-free
grammar.)
