First let me explain that our math dept email system has been down for ten
days and there is no indication when it will be back, although our sysop
has been working on it day and night.  I will circulate an announcement
when it is running again.  Meantime, use this address.

Is there one place that develops all the properties of factorization
systems?  We are especially interested in the non-strict case, that is in
which the right factor needn't be epic, nor the left factor be  monic, but
the unique diagonal fill-in condition holds.
