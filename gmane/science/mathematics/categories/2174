Probably there are people that put this in the definition --
the same people that require 0 != 1 in any ring,
or that a topological space not be empty,
or (for that matter) that a CCC not be trivial.
But if you're not one of those people,
then the Heyting algebra {*} captures the algebraic structure of
the (unique topology on the) empty space.

So with my definition, {T,F} is initial but {*} is final.
But even with yours, I don't believe that {T,F} becomes final.
There are 2 homomorphisms to it from the power set of {T,F}
(as a Boolean algebra, which is a special kind of Heyting algebra).
I don't think that your category has a final object
(any more than the category of nontrivial rings does,
nor the category of nonempty spaces has an initial object).
