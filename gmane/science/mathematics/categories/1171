Forgive my ignorance: is T+Y**T<----Y to be initial because
the usual construction for the exponential has the relevant
arrow as terminal? Can you suggest to me a reference for that
construction of exponentials?

As for significance: my own research into co-exponentials is
in terms of them as characteristic of lattices dual to
Heyting algebras. These dual-Heyting algebras work well
as algebras for a brand of paraconsistent logic (they have
a complement operator which has in general that an element
and its complement overlap). Alternatively, you can
think of co-exponentials as productive of the interesting
topological notions associated with closed sets, like boundary.

My feeling is that co-exponentials count as useful in more
interesting kinds of maths than turn up simply in those
categories dual to toposes.
