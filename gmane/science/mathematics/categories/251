Hi Rafael,

I don't know much about this, but I listened to an excellent talk of
Maltsiniotis a few months ago at IHES and posted the scanned notes in
a blog post here:

http://homotopical.wordpress.com/2009/01/26/maltsinotis-grothendieck-and-homotopical-algebra/

These notes (on page 11-12) contain at least the definition of proper
and smooth functors, and the duality statement, so maybe they can be
of some limited use. Hopefully other people on this list can provide
some more substantial information.

Best regards,
Andreas Holmstrom
