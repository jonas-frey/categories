Dear all,

We invite applications for PhD study at the University of Birmingham.

We are a group of (mostly) theoretical computer scientists who explore =20=

fundamental concepts in computation and programming language =20
semantics. This often involves profound and surprising connections =20
between different areas of computer science and mathematics. =46rom =20
category theory to =CE=BB-calculus and computational effects, from =
topology =20
to constructive mathematics, from game semantics to program =20
compilation, this is a diverse field of research that continues to =20
provide new insight and underlying structure.   See our webpage, with =20=

links to individual researchers, here:

http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/

Information about PhD applications may be found here:

http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-research/

If you are considering applying, please contact any of us.  We will be =20=

very happy to discuss the opportunities available.

Best regards,
the Birmingham CS theory group

mathematics, intuitionistic type theory)
