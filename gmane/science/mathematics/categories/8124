Yes indeed!

That's right. In this case, in fact, things are a bit boring; to say
that the reflection IH is a fibred reflection, equivalently a
localisation, means that the E-maps are stable under pullback, which in
turn means---by Section 6 of CJKP---that the M-maps already descend
along effective descent morphisms. So "trivial = locally trivial".

Thinking about this further, the situation here is actually completely
typical: if p: D ---> C is a fibration, and T is a fibred monad on D,
then any effective descent morphism for the fibration p will also be one
for the fibration T-Alg ----> C. Indeed, to say that a fibration sees a
particular map as an effective descent morphism is expressible as a
(bicategorical) orthogonality property in the 2-category Fib(C). Thus
the class of fibrations with this property is closed under bilimits; in
particular, under Eilenberg-Moore objects of monads. In short: if
objects descend, then for any fibred monad T, also T-algebras descend.

So, to summarise:

(a) If p: D ---> C is a fibration with sums, and T a fibred monad on p,
and f: x--->y in C, then the category of descent data of T-algebras
w.r.t. f is isomorphic to the category of f^* T_y f_!-algebras.

(b) If, in the same situation, f is an effective descent morphism for p,
then the category of descent data of T-algebras w.r.t. f is equivalent
to the category of T_y algebras

(c) Thus, in this situation, the category of f^* T_y f_! algebras is
equivalent to the category of T_y-algebras.

And unfortunately, the requirement of T's fibredness rules out all the
interesting examples, such as those coming from Galois theory. So
perhaps this is why (a) above does not appear in the literature; the
monadic treatment it promises for "local" structure is in fact, by (c),
only valid for local structure that already descends.

Thanks for the careful readings, George - I think I understand what is
going on here much better now!
