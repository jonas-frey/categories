[Apologies for multiple posting]

The French ANR project LOGOI is inviting applications for a postdoctoral
position within the team Logique de la Programmation (LDP) of the Institu=
t de
Math=C8matiques de Luminy (IML) in Marseille, France.


Context
-------

The LOGOI project pursues the programme of Geometry of Interaction (GoI),
which aims at a reconstruction of logic from interaction as the primitive
notion, considered as an abstract counterpart of cut elimination. This
programme has started together with linear logic and has evolved since it=
s
early days, from the limited case of multiplicatives to recent developmen=
ts
involving the theory of operator algebras and providing a strikingly new
perspective on implicit complexity via light logics.

The goals of the LOGOI project are on one side to better understand and r=
efine
the current theory of GoI, and on the other side to draw on the novel too=
ls and
concepts provided by this framework, in order to propose a new structured
approach to proof theory and its connections with other areas of computer
science.


Post Doctoral Position
----------------------

This is a full-time research position for one year, with a possible one-y=
ear
extension. It is expected to start at the beginning of fall 2012 (between=
  1
Sep. and 1 Nov.). Research will take place at the IML in Marseille.

The successful applicant will contribute to the main areas of the LOGOI p=
roject
research effort: geometry of interaction, ludics, proof theoretical aspec=
ts of
computation. Possible connections with other fields of proof theory and
computer science are also of interest. The post-doc is of course expected=
  to
participate to group activities (workshops, meetings, tutorials) both of =
the
LOGOI project and the LDP team.


Requirements
------------

Applicants must hold a PhD degree in computer science or mathematics, and
should have a strong background in logic and proof theory. Skills in an
additional area of computer science (complexity, concurrency, programming
language semantics, etc.) are very welcome.

If the PhD thesis is not defended yet, the candidate must provide the pla=
nned
defence date and the composition of the thesis committee.

Knowledge of French is not required.


Application
-----------

To apply, please send an email to logoi-postdoc@iml.univ-mrs.fr, includin=
g your
current CV, a link to a list of your publications, and a research stateme=
nt
summarizing your research activities and goals (preferably two pages at m=
ost).
You might also include the names of up to two references.

The deadline for applications is 20 june 2012, but early expression
of interest is encouraged.
