First, patent laws are national laws. But it is generally acknowledged, even
in the most patent-friendly countries, that a patent should protect somethi=
ng
*original*. As long as you have published your idea with a clearly
identifiable date of publication, for instance in a scientific journal, no
one should be able to patent it afterwards (I write "should" because patent
offices are often a bit skimpy).

Secondly, and once again, many countries do not allow patenting mathematical
results. Things are less clear for algorithms.

As a matter of fact, considering the cost of patent registration, the
depositer must expect something... Either to earn money, or to have its
competitors lose money, or (that may be the case for many public institutio=
ns)
to give evidence for "valorisation" of results to public authorities.=20

Except for the last case where patents may, perhaps, not be used to prevent
scientific work, other applications of patents are likely to be problematic
both ethically and economically as far as scientific research is concerned
(think about scientists working in institutions unable to afford royalties =
or
attorney expenses).=20
