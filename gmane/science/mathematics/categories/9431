Dear all,

Please accept our apologies if you receive multiple copies of this
announcement from different venues.

We are pleased to announce the AMS Special Session on Homotopy Type
Theory to be held on January 11, 2018 in San Diego, California, as
part of the Joint Mathematics Meetings (to be held January 10-13).

Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) is a new field of study that relates
constructive type theory to abstract homotopy theory.  Types are
regarded as synthetic spaces of arbitrary dimension and type equality
as homotopy equivalence.  Experience has shown that HoTT is able to
represent many mathematical objects of independent interest in a
direct and natural way.  Its foundations in constructive type theory
permit the statement and proof of theorems about these objects within
HoTT itself, enabling formalization in proof assistants and providing
a constructive foundation for other branches of mathematics.

This Special Session is affiliated with the AMS Mathematics Research
Communities (MRC) workshop for early-career researchers in Homotopy
Type Theory organized by Dan Christensen, Chris Kapulkin, Dan Licata,
Emily Riehl and Mike Shulman, which took place last June.

The Special Session will include talks by MRC participants, as well as
by senior researchers in the field, on various aspects of
higher-dimensional type theory including categorical semantics,
computation, and the formalization of mathematical theories.  There
will also be a panel discussion featuring distinguished experts from
the field.

Further information about the Special Session, including a schedule
and abstracts, can be found at:

http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2018/2197_program_ss14.html.

Please note that the early registration deadline is December 20, 2017.

If you have any questions about about the Special Session, please feel
free to contact one of the organizers.  We look forward to seeing you
in San Diego.

Sincerely,
