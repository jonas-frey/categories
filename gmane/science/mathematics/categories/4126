=3D=3D=3D=3D Call for Papers =3D=3D=3D=3D

=3D=3D=3D=3D 3rd Workshop on Games for Logic and Programming Languages =
=3D=3D=3D=3D
=3D=3D=3D=3D (GaLoP 2008) =3D=3D=3D=3D

=3D=3D=3D=3D April 5-6 =3D=3D=3D=3D
=3D=3D=3D=3D Budapest, Hungary =3D=3D=3D=3D
=3D=3D=3D=3D An ETAPS 2008 Workshop =3D=3D=3D=3D

GaLoP is an annual international workshop on game-semantic models for
logics and programming languages and their applications. This is an =20
informal
workshop that welcomes work in progress, overviews of more extensive
work, programmatic or position papers and tutorials as well as =20
contributed
papers and invited talks.

The Third GaLoP will be held in Hungary, Budapest between April 5 and 6.
It will be part of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and =20
Practice of
Software (ETAPS 2008).

Contributions are invited on all pertinent subjects, with particular =20
interest
in compositional game-semantic models in the style of Hyland-Ong or
Abramsky-Jagadeesan-Malacaria. Typical but not exclusive areas of =20
interest
are: categorical aspects; algorithmic aspects; programming languages and
full abstraction; semantics of logics and proof systems; proof search;
higher-order automata; program verification and model checking; program
analysis; security; theories of concurrency; probabilistic models.

Instructions for submission will be posted on the workshop's web page:
=09
	http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/galop

There will be no formal proceedings but the possibility of a special =20
issue in
a journal will be discussed (selected papers from Galop 2005 will =20
appear in
Annals of Pure and Applied Logic).
