Dear category theorists,

Does the concept of "filtered monad" exist in the literature? Here are =
two basic models of what I have in mind.

1. Let C be the category of sets, let F:C->C be the set underlying the =
free monoid on S, and let F_n(S) be the subset of F(S) consisting of =
words of length at most n. Then the monad structure map F o F-->F =
restricts to maps F_m o F_n-->F_{mn}, and F_1 is the identity functor.

2. Let C be the category of R-modules (R a given ring), F(M) is the =
tensor product R[x] \otimes_R M, and F_n(M) is the sub-R-module M + xM + =
... + x^n M of F(M). Then the monad structure map F o F --> F restricts =
to a map F_m o F_n --> F_{m+n}, and F_0 is the identity functor.

So, in the first example, I'd say that the monad F is filtered by the =
ordered monoid of non-negiative integers under multiplication, and in =
the second example, it's filtered by that under addition.

There seems to be a pretty obvious way of formalizing this, and since =
many monads in practice come with such a structure, I'd guess that this =
concept is in the literature, but I didn't find anything on the internet =
or in the textbooks on my shelf. But perhaps that's because it's not =
called a "filtered monad" or because it's a special case of a general =
concept with a completely different name. So, does this concept exist in =
the literature? I'm writing something about a particular monad with a a =
filtered structure, and after I define it, I'd like to have the sentence =
"In the language of [5], the functors F_n endow F with a filtered monad =
structure."

Yours,

James Borger
