(For "the morphisms are as you described" to work, unless I'm missing an
op somewhere, in the move from (P,F,c) to (F_*,F^*,t), P as the
component that "transforms forward" has to be F^*.)

I learned about the Isbell envelope from Ross just this January.  Ross
said he'd learned it from Bill Lawvere, who he said named it that after
learning it from Isbell.

In the course of some follow-up discussion, Rich Wood pointed out to us
the following translation into the language of profunctors of what both
Andrew and Ross wrote just now.  To avoid having to play favourites by
choosing between (P,F,c) and (F_*,F^*,t) I'll pick the neutral (A,X,r),
r: A x X --> ? I've been using myself for this stuff, where the early
letters A,B,... transform forwards and the late letters X,Y,...
transform backwards, just as with Chu spaces.

Organize the presheaves A and X as the profunctors A: C^op x 1 --> Set
and X: 1^op x C --> Set in the category Prof (Australian: Mod) of
profunctors ((bi)modules, distributors) and their natural
transformations.  In notation more suggestive of how they compose, these
become

    A: 1 -|-> C
    X: C -|-> 1
    r: AX --> 1_C

where AX is profunctor composition at 1, and 1_C: C^op x C --> Set is
the identity profunctor 1_C: C -|-> C in Prof, aka the homfunctor of C.

In general, composition of profunctors entails a left Kan extension, but
in this case the composition is taking place at 1, trivializing the
composite AX to A x X: C^op x C --> Set (Andrew's P x F).

The Isbell envelope being strikingly reminiscent of the Chu
construction, it is natural to ask how they're related, which I'll offer
an answer to in the rest of this message.

A little calculation shows that for the Isbell envelope of the
one-morphism category 1 (whose one object I'll denote * in the next
paragraph), E(1) is equivalent to Set x Set^op.  But this is also
Chu(Set,1) where 1 is now the singleton set.

What about Chu(Set,2)?  The trick here is to take C to be the two-object
category 1+1, augmented with two morphisms from what I'll call the
positive copy j of 1 to the negative copy \ell, call this C_2 as the
category naturally associated to the profunctor 2: 1 -|-> 1 defined by
2(*,*) = 2.  I'd been doing this with what I call Dsh(2) below, but Ross
pointed out to me (more generally) that Dsh(K) fully embeds in E(C_K) as
follows.  I'll write it assuming Rich's profunctor typing of A and X as
above so that the second argument of A and the first argument of X is
always the object * of 1.  (In that language Ross's t_{a,b} : F^*(a) x
F_*(b) --> A(a,b) becomes t_{a,b} : \int^c F^*(a,c) x F_*(c,b) -->
A(a,b) which exposes the left Kan nature of the product, albeit trivial
as noted above.)

The objects (A,X,r) of E(C_2) now consist of two pairs of sets: A =
(A(j,*),A(\ell,*)) and X = (X(*,j),X(*,\ell)).  Chu(Set,2) then emerges
from E(C) as the full subcategory of E(C_2) for which A(\ell,*) = X(*,j)
= {}.  In effect A and X behave as though they were single sets A(j,*)
and X(*,\ell), the effect we need for (A,X,r) to be an ordinary Chu space.

The generalization to Chu(Set,K) simply entails setting C_K(j,\ell) = K,
leaving C_K(\ell,j) empty as implicitly assumed above, with |C_K(j,j)| =
|C_K(\ell,\ell)| = 1, and with no other change to the description of the
full subcategory of E(C_K) constituting Chu(Set,K).

In a posting to this list on 9/7/02 with subject line "Presheaves etc.
in a uniform way" I described (even more obscurely than my usual
postings) a common generalization of presheaves and Chu spaces that can
be described far more clearly using the above language.  It amounts to a
generalization of the Isbell envelope (which as I said I only learned
about this January from Ross).  Quite independently of Rich and within a
day of him, Jeff Egger suggested to me exactly the following typing for
A and X in this generalization.

In place of the small C parametrizing the Isbell envelope E(C), take two
small categories J and L (explaining the j and \ell in the above).
Define a *disheaf* (at CT'04 I called these "communes") on a profunctor
K: L -|-> J to be a triple (A,X,r) where A: 1 -|-> J and X: L -|-> 1 are
profunctors and r: AX --> K: L -|-> J is a natural transformation.  By
analogy with Chu(Set,K), write Dsh(Set,K) for the category of disheaves
on the profunctor K, whose morphisms are just as for the Isbell
envelope, which in turn are just as for Chu spaces.

The Isbell envelope E(C) = Dsh(Set,1_C).  This is the sense in which Dsh
generalizes E.

(The "Set" parameter is a bad habit arising out of the notation Chu(V,k)
adopted around 1992, I forget by whom.  It is probably better to write
Chu(K) and Dsh(K) and let V be inferred from context as the ambient V in
which one is working, which I'll do now.)

As pointed out to me by Ross, E(C) generalizes Dsh(K) by taking C to be
what Ross called the *cone* C_K of K: J^op x L --> Set (L -|-> J),
namely J+L augmented with  morphisms from each j to each \ell picked out
of the set K(j,\ell) and composed as prescribed by the functoriality of
K.  (I learned this category representation of profunctors/bimodules the
hard way from Robert Seely at CT'04, who kindly said of my "bipartite
categories" during my talk, "That's a bimodule!")

The generalization is weaker (in some sense) than the other direction,
in that Dsh(K) is not E(C_K) itself but only the full subcategory
obtained by requiring A(j,*) = X(*,\ell) = 0 for all j in \ob(J) and
\ell in \ob(L).

I've recently found Dsh(K) very useful as a foundation for ontology (not
so much Aristotle as XML, which among other things supplies the Web
Ontology Language OWL with its presentation syntax), where it furnishes
an extensional conception of the notion of attribute (which the
Wikipedia article "Property (philosophy)" helpfully points out doesn't
exist), makes sense of C.I. Lewis's highly controversial notion of
qualia from the 1920's (philosophers today divide into qualiaphiles and
qualiaphobes, see the Wikipedia article on "Qualia") as the elements of
K(j,\ell), and offers a mechanism for interaction between the two
components in Cartesian dualism, which failed after a century of
unconvincing candidates for a meaningful such mechanism (Malebranche's
occasionalism, Leibniz's monads, etc.).

 From a more mathematical standpoint disheaves are even more general
than Chu spaces.  I can imagine a few raised eyebrows here---after my
decade of propaganda on Chu spaces as the ultimate universal framework,
the natural question would be, how could anything be more general than a
Chu space?

It depends on whether you're willing to settle for some full subcategory
of some Chu(Set,K) or want your category "on the nose" without the
hassle of having to come up with some ad hoc characterization of the
desired subcategory (cf. the distinction above between Dsh(K) as a
generalization of E(C) and vice versa where only the latter requires the
extra step of specifying a full subcategory).  Instead one can point to
a profunctor K and say that a K-flapdoodle is precisely an object of
Dsh(K).  For example there is a straightforwardly exhibited K such that
Dsh(K) consists essentially of the inelastic acylic graphs, those having
invariant path length.  No presheaf category consists of these, and
Isbell envelopes only contain them as a full subcategory (I don't know
if there's a K large enough that Chu(K) does the same job).

I have a paper on this in the works, focusing mainly on the ontology
application for now and therefore trying (only half successfully I fear)
to minimize the deployment of categorical weapons of math destruction in
order to make it more accessible to those likely to care at all about
ontology, let me know if you're interested.
