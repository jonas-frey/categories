			  LAST ANNOUNCEMENT

                                * * *

 Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop
 bringing together researchers in mathematics and computer science with
 a focus on the application of category theory in computer science.

 This year's meeting will be hosted in the Department of Mathematics
 and Statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.

 There will be an informal welcoming reception in the evening of May
 29, starting at 5:30. The scientific program starts on May 30, and
 consists of four tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to
 category theory, as well as a day and a half of research talks. The
 meeting ends at mid-day on June 1.
