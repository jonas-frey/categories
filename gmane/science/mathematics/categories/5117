Dear Mike,

Is your question motivated by an interest in equivalences or categorical
models? For the "unsorted" =F0-calculus the most well exercised categorical
models are certain classes of functor categories. You need this "extra
layer" to take into account the name generation. Maybe i'm not seeing
something, but i don't think introducing a sorting discipline will perturb
these models very much. It certainly doesn't affect confluence. You can hav=
e
well sorted processes that are not confluent. The lack of confluence arises
from the essential non-determinism in reduction. Here's a race condition
that is still well-sorted:

   - (new u : S)x?(y).y!(u) + (new v : T)z?(w).w!(v) | (new a : A)x!(a) |
   (new b : B)z!(b)
      - reduces along one path to (new a)(new u)a!(u)
      - and along another to (new b)(new v)b!(v)

The better equivalence for the =F0-calculus is bisimilarity. In fact, in ma=
ny
cases of (nominal) rewrite systems that are confluent, bisimilarity can be
the better equivalence. Consider applicative bisimilarity for the lambda
calculus. More generally, there are results that show that the entire famil=
y
of proposed processes equivalences can be characterized as bisimulation up
to.

Best wishes,

--greg

P.S. There's something very strange going on in this hierarchy of
equivalences. As the equivalences can see more fine-grained structure, the
complexity goes down. Language equivalence for regular languages is P-Space=
.
The corresponding bisimulation problem is polynomial. The language
equivalence problem for CFLs: not decidable. The corresponding bisimulation
problem: polynomial. You might wave this away by observing that in the
language equivalence situation you are searching "program space" while in
the bismulation situation you are checking that two program match in a
step-by-step fashion. But, then consider the logical equivalence of
spatial-behavioral logic -- which is strictly more expressive than
bisimilarity.
