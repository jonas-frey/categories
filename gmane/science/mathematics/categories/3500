PSSL 85 in Nice - first announcement

It is proposed to hold the 85th meeting of the
Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic in Nice
during the weekend of 24/25 March 2007.

We expect to have some money available to support
students' and postdocs' attendance at the conference.
If you are interested please write to Eugenia Cheng.

For those unfamiliar with PSSLs, they are a
long-running series of meetings, usually held on a
weekend at a university somewhere in Europe. They are
fairly informal, and presentations of work in progress
are quite acceptable.  The name is a (charming)
historical relic: talks cover all aspects of category
theory, not just sheaves and logic.

Further details of the arrangements will be announced
by early February and posted at the following website:

http://math.unice.fr/~eugenia/pssl85 .

In the meantime if you have any questions please do not
hesitate to contact me.


Regards,
Eugenia Cheng
