Fred, you *surely* meant something else by this.

Dana was sufficiently taken with CSLat as to publish a short note on
some of its properties (JPAA? AU?), prompting Peter Johnstone to write a
review of her note to the effect that she should have exploited its
self-duality to make her note even shorter.  (Peter could have set a
good example by making his review a lot shorter.  They were both young
back then, with all that implies, but come to think of it so were we
all, including you, Fred.)

One might ask what is the least change to CSLat breaking this property
while retaining most of what makes it interesting.  I found one answer
to this at

http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/es.pdf

in the course of answering a different question: is there a
non-degenerate model of linear logic that models the duality of time and
information and of events and states?  My suggestion was to leave the
(non-empty) meet-join structure of CSLat and its dual unchanged while
switching top and bottom.  The result was cute and good for a few papers
but eventually I saw the light and switched to Chu spaces which answered
my original question much better, albeit without as tight a connection
to CSLat (it's just a tiny subcategory of Chu(Set,2), and anyway these
days I work in Chu(Set,4) when not hacking climate, Euclid, etc.).
