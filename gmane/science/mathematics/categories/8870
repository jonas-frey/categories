Dear Nikita,=0A=
=0A=
the special significant case with which you begin, deals with the forgetful=
  =0A=
functor (which you call P) from rings to sets. It lives in a category =0A=
(topos) E of covariant functors from rings to sets, and this category you =
=0A=
do not give a name. But P and E seem to me to be the main actors in your =
=0A=
construction. What you call R[S] (for R in Rings, and S in Sets) is the =0A=
value at R of the exponent object P^S -> P in E. In particular, R[1] is =0A=
the value at R of the object P -> P in E. What you observe has as a =0A=
special case the fact that P -> P, as an object in E, has the universal =0A=
property of "P[X]", the free P-algebra in one generator; i.e.=0A=
P[X] =3D (P -> P) =0A=
in E. This coincidence, of a colimit type universal property (of P[X]), wit=
h =0A=
a limit type universal property (of the exponential P -> P), is =0A=
significant, and generalizes to further duality results in E. =0A=
It also generalizes to any othe algebraic theory T, not just to the theory =
=0A=
of rings. For instance, for T the initial algebraic theory (the algebraic =
=0A=
theory of sets), it implies that P+1 =3D (P -> P).=0A=
For an elaboration of these generalizations, see my "Duality for Generic =
=0A=
Algebras", Cahiers 56 (2015), 2-14, or =0A=
