i designed two tools which people who built them built on top of
eclipse, and i must admint that i managed to completely miss those
categorical ideas. eclipse is very handy, but some simple class
hierarchies often become unrecognizable in its straitjacket. i am
probably not the only one who would be curious to learn more about
category theory behind eclipse :)

i hope that you are right that it is a good thing that IBM supports
the open source. i also hope that it is a good thing that Exxon,
Chevron and BP support the alternative sources of energy, and that
Philip Morris supports the teen culture.
