Dear All,

I thought the list members may be interested in the following
recent note of Misha Gromov which *very* carefully uses ideas of category t=
heory
to talk about entropy. Particuarly, his point of view on category theory
may be appealing.

In a Search for a Structure, Part 1: On Entropy. June 19, 2012
http://www.ihes.fr/~gromov/PDF/structres-entropy-june-2012.pdf

At the end of the paper, he says:

Yet, I hope that I managed to convey the message: the mathematical language=
  d
eveloped by the end of the 20th century by far exceeds in its expressive
power anything, even imaginable, say, before 1960. Any *meaningful* idea co=
ming
from science can be fully developed in this language.

In the paper, he also says:


To see this, you
just need to realize that =94something=94 of a physicist, is a covariant
functor from
a suitable =94category of protocols=94 to the category of sets =96 outcomes=
  of exper-
iments; all you have to do afterwards is to follow the guidelines prescribe=
d by
the syntax of category theory.
(Arguably, the category language, some call it =94abstract=94, reflects men=
tal
undercurrents that surface as our =94intuitive reasoning=94; a comprehensiv=
e math-
ematical description of this =94reasoning=94, will be, probably, even
farther removed
from the =94real world=94 than categories and functors.)

Sincerely, Misha
