Of course you can write down different presentations for the theory
classified by simplicial sets; any set of generators for the topos
will give you one. But you're unlikely to find anything familiar: if
there were a geometric theory "occurring in nature" whose category of
models (in any topos) was equivalent to the category of bounded linear
orders, that equivalence would almost certainly be well known.
