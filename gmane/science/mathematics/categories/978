                            CALL FOR PAPERS

                               CONCUR'99
          10th International Conference on Concurrency Theory
            Eindhoven, The Netherlands, August 24--27, 1999.

(apologies for multiple copies)

A postscript version of this call for papers can be found on the above
mentioned website.

SCOPE
The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together researchers,
developers and students in order to advance the theory of concurrency,
and promote its applications. Interest in this topic is continuously
growing, as a consequence of the importance and ubiquity of concurrent
systems and their applications, and of the scientific relevance of
their foundations. Submissions are solicited in all areas of semantics,
logics and verification techniques for concurrent systems.

Topics include (but are not limited to) concurrency related aspects of:
models of computation and semantic domains, process algebras, Petri
nets, event structures, real-time systems, hybrid systems,
decidability, model-checking, verification techniques, refinement
techniques, term and graph rewriting, distributed programming, logic
constraint programming, object-oriented programming, typing systems and
algorithms, case studies, tools and environments for programming and
verification.
