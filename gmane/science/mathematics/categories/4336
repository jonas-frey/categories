Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European
Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL). The conference is
intended for computer scientists whose research activities involve
logic,  as well as for logicians working on issues significant for
computer science.

Topics of interest include:
automated deduction and interactive theorem proving,
constructive mathematics and type theory,
equational logic and term rewriting,
automata and games,
modal and temporal logics,
model checking,
logical aspects of computational complexity,
finite model theory,
computational proof theory,
logic programming and constraints,
lambda calculus and combinatory logic,
categorical logic and topological semantics,
domain theory,
database theory,
specification, extraction and transformation of programs,
logical foundations of programming paradigms,
verification and program analysis,
linear logic,
higher-order logic,
nonmonotonic reasoning.

Proceedings will be published in the LNCS series.
Each paper accepted by the Programme Committee must be presented at the
conference by one of the authors, and final copy be prepared according
to Springer's guidelines.

Submitted papers must be in Springer's LNCS style and of no more than 15
pages, presenting work not previously published.  They must not be
submitted concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings.
Any closely related work submitted by the authors to a conference or
journal before March 28, 2008 must be reported to the PC chairs. Papers
authored or coauthored by members of the Programme Committee are not
allowed.

Submitted papers must be in English and provide sufficient detail to
allow the Programme Committee to assess the merits of the paper.
Full proofs may appear in a technical appendix which will be read at the
reviewer's discretion. The title page must contain: title and author(s),
physical and e-mail addresses, identification of the corresponding
author, an abstract of no more than, 200 words, and a list of keywords.

ACKERMANN AWARD:
The Ackermann Award is the EACSL Outstanding Dissertation Award for
Logic in Computer Science.
The Ackermann Award 2008 will be presented to the recipients at CSL2008.
