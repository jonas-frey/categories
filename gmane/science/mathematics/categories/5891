I don't know any reasonable formalisation in Intensional Type Theory. =20=

People usually assume that hom sets are a setoid but objects aren't. =20
This means that constructions like arrow categories are not available. =20=

To avoid this one would have to formalize explicitely what is a family =20=

of setoids indexed over a setoid. After this it is hard to see the =20
category theory...
