                       Call for Papers
                         FICS 2012
                March 24, 2012, Tallinn, Estonia
                Satellite workshop to ETAPS 2012

                http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/fics2012/

Important dates:

Abstract submission:          4 Dec 2011
Paper submission:            11 Dec 2011
Notification:                21 Jan 2012
Final version:                5 Feb 2012

Background:

Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer
science and logic by justifying induction and recursive definitions. The
construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated in
many different frameworks such as: design and implementation of
programming languages, program logics, databases. The aim of this
workshop is to provide a forum for researchers to present their results
to those members of the computer science and logic communities who
study or apply the theory of fixed points. Previous workshops were held
in Brno (1998, MFCS/CSL workshop), Paris (2000, LC workshop), Florence
(2001, PLI workshop), Copenhagen (2002, LICS (FLoC) workshop), Warsaw
(2003, ETAPS workshop), Coimbra (2009, CSL workshop) and Brno (2010,
MFCS/CSL workshop).

Topics include, but are not restricted to:

     * categorical, metric and ordered fixed point models
     * fixed points in algebra and coalgebra
     * fixed points in languages and automata
     * fixed points in programming language semantics
     * the mu-calculus and fixed points in modal logic
     * fixed points in process algebras and process calculi
     * fixed points in the lambda-calculus, functional programming and
       type theory
     * fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits
     * fixed points in logic programming and theorem proving
     * finite model theory, descriptive complexity theory, fixed points
       in databases

Invited speakers:

     * Andreas Abel, Munich, Germany
     * Luke Ong, Oxford, UK

Submission:

Selection of contributed talks is based on extended abstracts/short
papers. Submission is via EasyChair
<http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfics2012>
in two stages: titles and abstracts by 4 December, and extended
abstracts/ short papers in LaTeX by 11 December. The authors will be
notified of acceptance/rejection by 21 January 2012. We plan to
distribute the short papers presented at the meeting via the opensource
repository EPTCS. Submissions must be limited to
      * 8 pages using  eptcs.cls  <http://style.eptcs.org/> or
      * 6 pages using  easychair.cls
<http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip>. Final submissions for the
proceedings will require using eptcs.cls.

Journal publication:

If the number and quality of submissions and accepted talks warrant
this, a special issue of an internationally recognized journal devoted
to the event will be published.
