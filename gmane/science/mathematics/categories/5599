I think it is more perspicuous to treat this, not as an
overloading of \in, but as an "implicit conversion"
associated to the notion of category; that is, we allow the
forgetful functor Cat->Set to be applied silently in contexts
which otherwise would not type-check. In fact the vast
majority of "abuses of notation" are of this character, when
applied to, for example, any forgetful functor from an
Eilenberg-Moore category; the discrete category functor
Set->Cat; the Yoneda embedding C -> [C^op, Set]; the
forgetful functor from universal cones to their vertex, etc,
etc. In principle this becomes problematic as soon as the
category generated by all such implicit conversions has
non-identity idempotents; in practice, this category is free
on a graph and we hope to identify a shortest path between
two vertices!
