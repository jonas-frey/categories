If

G -> H
| <= |
v    v
K -> L

is a square (with a 2-cell as shown) in cat then

applying ^ =((-)^{op},Set) gives

G^<- H^
^ => ^
|    |
K^<- L^

and taking the mate with respect to the horizontal adjunctions
given by left Kan extension gives

G^-> H^
^ => ^
|    |
K^-> L^

If the original square is a comma square then the 2-cell in
the third square is invertible. There are squares other than
comma squares, cocomma squares for example, for which the
2-cell in the third square is invertible. See Rene Guitart's
early work on exact squares.

Best, Rj Wood
