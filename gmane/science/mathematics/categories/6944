Sergei,

My colleagues and I have been looking for something like this for a =
project.  We need to be able to specify small categories as the =
completions of finite graphs we are given, extend these by specifying =
commutative diagrams, pullbacks, etc, of interest, then define functors =
generated from graph homomorphisms, and take colimits of diagrams in =
Cat, etc etc.  We haven't found anything that does all this.  So, we're =
programming it in Haskell---one of our grad students knows the language. =
  We'll be happy to share our experience and will probably make the code =
available.  It's a work in progress.

Best regards,
Mike Healy
