Dear All,

What Tom says now, and what Bill calls a simple answer referring to Miche=
l
Hebert, also suggests to mention

[H. Andr=E9ka and I. N=E9meti, Los lemma holds in every category, Stud. S=
ci.
Math. Hung. 13, 1978, 361-376]

(although a previous paper of the same authors would be needed, I think).
And I am sure many other people also considered many other candidates for
the concept of a "law" producing a suitable Galois connection. And - no
doubt - many such constructions would produce interesting Galois closed
classes.

However, I think "the Universal Algebra of 75 years ago" gave a beautiful
and fundamental example, were the Galois closed classes are fully and
beautifully described (that Galois connection deals with subvarieties of =
a
fixed variety, with fixed "basic operators" and so there is no problem wi=
th
"What is a variety?" of course).

This does not mean that I am trying to argue with Bill: Of course it is t=
rue
that Bill's thesis was a great further enlightenment, and of course it is
true that TODAY seeing only those Galois connections and not seeing
adjunctions containing them and much more (also in Galois theory itself!)=
 is
too bad!
