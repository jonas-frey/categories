Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference series of the
European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL). The 15th
Annual Conference, CSL 2006, will take place in Szeged, Hungary,
from September 25 to September 29, 2006.  It will be organized by the
Department of Foundations of Computer Science at the University

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for
workshops on topics relating logic to computer science.

Proposals should include:

* A short scientific summary and justification of the proposed topic.
* Proposed format and agenda.
* Proposed duration.
* Procedures for selecting participants and papers.
* Expected number of participants.
* Potential invited speakers.
* Plans for dissemination (e.g. proceedings, journal special issue).
