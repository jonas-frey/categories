  constraints should be given in the appendix or made accessible through a
  reliable link to a freely available electronic preprint. The papers must
  be submitted in English, in the LNCS format (LaTeX, as pdf; final version
  with source) with page numbering turned on using the \pagestyle{plain}
  command; instructions are here:

  Simultaneous submission to journals or to other conferences with published
  proceedings is not allowed. The proceedings of the symposium will be
  published in Springer's LNCS series. Accepted papers MUST be presented
  at the symposium.

  Submissions should be uploaded to the EasyChair Conference system:
