Dear categorists,

I have recently proved an (E,M)-factorisation theorem 
in the framework of axiomatic rewriting systems:
every derivation X -> Y factorises (up to Levy permutation equivalence)
into a head reduction X -> Z followed by a non-head reduction Z -> Y.

One special difficulty in my case is that I do not define 
the class M of non-head reductions as a category.
So, I need a characterisation of factorisation system (E,M)
without any assumption of categoricity of E or M.
Here is the statement of the theorem I finally proved:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let E and M be two classes of morphisms in a category C.
(E,M) is a factorisation system of C if and only if
the four following properties hold:

1. every morphism f in C can be factored as f=me with m in M and e in E,
2. if e is a morphism in E and m is a morphism in M then e is orthogonal to m,
3. if i is an iso left composable to e in E, then ie is in E,
4. if i is an iso right composable to m in M, then mi is in M.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do not know if this characterisation already exists in the litterature
on factorisation systems. If it does, please send me the reference
to integrate in my paper.
