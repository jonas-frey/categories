Less than two weeks are left before the 86th Peripatetic Seminar on =20
Sheaves and Logic,

http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/psslHomeEN.html

to be held at the Institut Elie Cartan in Nancy on September 8-9.

A list of participants is now available at

http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/listPart.html

It is incomplete: some people who have told me they were coming have =20
not registered yet. As you can see we still can accomodate a small =20
number of talks.

In the PSSL tradition, people arriving not too late Friday are =20
welcome at Le Petit Cuny,  97 Grande Rue, where some of us will hang =20
around starting about 7pm, to have drinks and sample the hearty local =20=

(well, Alsatian) cuisine, in particular Flammekuche, our very own =20
answer to pizza. There will also be a banquet on Saturday evening for =20=

which those who want to attend will be asked a moderate sum.


Looking forward to seeing you in Nancy

Fran=E7ois Lamarche
