Dear Colleagues,

John Power, recently retired and now an honorary professor at
Macquarie University, turned 60 in December 2019. John has made
substantial contributions to category theory and its applications to
computer science throughout his career, including coherence problems,
higher-dimensional categories, algebraic theories, algebraic effects
in computation, and logic programming.

To celebrate John's achievements, and to inspire further work,
following the workshops for John at Bath (*) and at Kyoto (**) we are
planning a Festschrift in Honour of John as a special issue of
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science. The editors are Masahito
Hasegawa (Kyoto), Guy McCusker (Bath) and Steve Lack (Macquarie). We
welcome a range of contributions to the Festschrift, both original
papers as well as survey papers related to John's work in a broad
sense. All submissions will be reviewed according to MSCS' usual
procedures.

We plan the following schedule, aiming at publishing the special issue in 2021:

      Notification of intention to submit: 31 May 2020
      Submission by: 30 November 2020

At this point, we are looking for expressions of an intention to
submit, which should be sent to Masahito Hasegawa
<hassei@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp> by 31 May 2020.

  (*) A Workshop for John Power
  27 June 2019, University of Bath
  organized by Neil Ghani and Guy McCusker

  (**) A Workshop in Honour of John Power on the occasion of his 60th Birthday
  23 December 2019, Kyoto University
  organized by Masahito Hasegawa, Ichiro Hasuo and Makoto Takeyama
