This kind of condition occurs in topology as a fibrant square - but where
all the maps are fibrations as is the map A ---> B x_D C . This can be
generalised to cubes. See a paper by R. Steiner on

`Resolutions of spaces by n-cubes of fibrations',  J. London Math. Soc.(2),
34, 169-176, 1986

used to build a complete (strict) algebraic model of homotopy n-types which
allows some computations.

This raises the spectre in algebra of

Resolutions of A by free  crossed n-cubes of A.

to give a more `nonabelian' homological algebra. Of course crossed n-cubes
of A should be equivalent to n-fold groupoids in A. This would presumably
bring in higher versions of nonabelian tensor products in A; a bibliography
of such a tensor, mainly for n=2, has 90 items.

This probably does not help to answer Mike's question on the name!
