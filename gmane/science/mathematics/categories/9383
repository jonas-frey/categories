Dear All,

As you may know, my friend and collaborator Myles Tierney passed away a few=
  days ago.
I thank you all for the condolences expressed.
I would like to briefly recall the contributions of Myles to mathematics an=
d our collaboration.

Myles received his Phd from Columbia University in 1965, under the directio=
n of Samuel Eilenberg
with a dissertation on "Classifying Spaces for K-Theory mod P".
He belongs to a cohort of Eilenberg's students (Lawvere:1963, Applegate:196=
5, Tierney:1965, Beck:1967)
that was to have a major influence on the developement of category theory.
After his Phd, he was invited by Eldon Dyer to join the faculty at Rice uni=
versity in Houston.
He left Rice after 15 months to visit the ETH Forschungsinstitut f=FBr Math=
ematics in Zurich, where Beno Eckmann
was assembling a group of category theorists and algebraic geometers that i=
ncluded
Bill Lawvere (1964-67,1968-69), Myles Tierney (1966-1968), Peter Gabriel, J=
on Beck, Peter Freyd and Mike Barr.
Myles worked on the simplicial construction of spectra and he published his=
  work in a Lecture Notes
"Categorical Constructions in Stable Homotopy Theory".
Lawvere worked on the axiomatic of the category of categories and he collab=
orated with Myles on
finding new axioms for toposes. Having introduced the sub-object classifier=
, he discovered
the notion of elementary topos and Myles discovered that a Grothendieck top=
ology is the same thing
as a closure operator on the sub-object classifier. They  kept developing t=
he theory of elementary topoi
when they both joined Dalhousie University in 1969. While at Dalhousie, the=
y organised an international
conference on topos theory (January 1971) with the participation of algebra=
ic geometers, category theorists and
logicians (Bucur, Giraud, Goodman, Kock, Myhill, Illusie, Lambek, Scott, Ve=
rdier, Tierney, etc).
The proceedings of the conference include the paper "Sheaf theory and the C=
ontinuum Hypothesis"
   in which Myles constructs a boolean topos satisfying the axiom of choice =
but for which the
Continuum Hypothesis fails. His construction showed that the forcing method=
s introduced by Paul Cohen
were essentially sheaf theoretic in nature. The paper had a strong influenc=
e on the subsequent developements
of the logical aspects of topos theory. Unfortunately, the collaboration be=
tween Myles and Bill ended in Dalhousie,
partly because of the political turmoil of that period. Myles joined the fa=
culty at Rutgers and
Bill the faculty at the University of Buffalo NY.  Myles has two papers on =
classifying topo=EF; in the first,
"On the spectrum of a Ringed Topos",  he uses the Stone dual of the spectru=
m of a commutative ring to give a
new construction of Hakim's spectrum of a ringed topos; in the second paper=
  "Forcing topologies and Classifying Topoi",
he shows that any (elementary) geometric theory has a classifying (elementa=
ry) topos.
The two papers were published in the proceedings of a conference in honour =
of Eilenberg,
with the participations of Maurice Auslander, Kuo-Tsai Chen, Barry Mitchell=
, Eldon Dyer, Peter Freyd. John Gray,
Dale Husemoller, Daniel Kan, Bill Lawvere, Saunders Mac Lane, John Moore an=
d Alex Rosenberg.
I began to collaborate with Myles in 1979, but our work was brutally interr=
upted by a
   terrible accident that left Myles physically crippled for the rest of his=
  life.
His determination to survive and his willingness to keep doing mathematics =
were admirable.
We eventually published the fruit of our collaboration in the AMS Memoir
"An extension of the Galois theory of Grothendieck".
We showed that every Grothendieck topos can be represented by a localic gro=
upoid.
The result was shedding some light on Grothendieck's view that toposes are =
generalised spaces.
Grothendieck had introduced various cohomology theories for toposes (we may=
  argue that toposes were
precisely invented for that reason) but there was virtually no homotopy the=
ory.
We wondered if one could construct the analog of a Postnikov tower for a to=
pos?
There was a clear analogy between atomic toposes (introduced by Barr) and K=
(G,1) spaces.
I visited Columbia University in 1982-84 and we had a weekly seminar
with the participation of Alex Heller and Bob Thomason.
During that time, I succeeded in constructing a Quillen model structure on =
the category
of simplicial objects of any Grothendieck topos; the model structure has ap=
plications to
to higher stacks and to non-abelian cohomology, but the connection between
the topos structure and the model structure was mysterious.
We began to investigate this question systematically. We eventually showed =
that the category
of internal groupoids in the topos of simplicial sets admits a model struct=
ure which is Quillen equivalent
to the model category of simplical sets.
We later extended the equivalence to the category of simplical objects in a=
  general Grothendieck topos.

In retrospect, the hypothesis that the topos of simplicial sets was the rig=
ht framework for understanding
the homotopy theory of spaces was off the mark. A better framework is the n=
otion of *model topos* (=3Dhigher topos)
introduced  by Charles Rezk in the late nineties and which served as a fram=
ework in the derived algebraic
of Bertrand To=EBn, Gabriele Vezzosi and Jacob Lurie. But we were not entir=
ely off the mark!
The notion of higher topos depends on higher categories to the same extent =
that  the notion of topos depends
on categories (and the notion of Heyting algebra depends on posets). In my =
paper "Quasi-categories vs Segal spaces"
in collaboration with Myles, we show  that the model structure for quasi-ca=
tegories is Quillen equivalent to the
model category for complete Segal spaces (introduced by Rezk) and to the mo=
del category for Segal categories
(introduced by Hirschowitz and Simpson). The equivalences now fit into a la=
rger network described by Julie Bergner
and which provides a foundation to higher category theory.

Myles was the advisor of seven phd:

Ira Wolf (Rutgers, 1971)
Radu Diaconescu (Dalhousie, 1973)
Carol Keller (Rutgers, 1983)
Norman S. Adam (Rutgers, 1984)
Terence Lindgren (Rutgers, 1984)
Todd Trimble (Rutgers, 1994)
Mauri Luca (Rutgers, 1998)

Radu Diaconescu has many contributions to topos theory.=20
Tod Trimble has proved an important coherence theorem for star-autonomous c=
ategories;
he has contributions to higher category theory.


For many years, Myles organised with Heller a yearly NY category theory mee=
ting.
Hanne and Myles joyfully opened their Soho loft to all. I often sleept on t=
he floor in a sleeping bag!
Nobody wanted to miss the saturday night gathering which often included
Eilenberg, Mac Lane, Heller, Linton, Bass, Lawvere, Beck, Freyd, Barr, Mitc=
hell, Dubuc, Duskin, Par=E9, Makkai, Bunge,  Diaconescu, Pelletier, Niefiel=
d, Schanuel, MacDonald,
Wood, Rosebrugh,Tholen and many others, sometime visitors from Europe and A=
ustralia.
Thank you Hanne and Myles!

Andr=E9
