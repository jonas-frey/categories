> Hi Jeff ,
> sorry, I should have been more careful . What I mean on elementary terms =
is:
> i) a set of objects
> ii) horizontal and vertical arrows
> iii) horizontal 2-cells between pairs of parallel horizontal
.. arrows

(iv) vertical 2-cells between paris of parallel vertical arrows
(v) cells (squares) in squares of horizontal and vertical arrows
(vi) cubes for a pair of squares connected at all four sides by
2-cells, horizontal at the horizontal sides, vertical at the vertical
sides

All of this composes in the expected way, i.e. objects, the horizontal
arrows and 2-cells form a 2-category, likewise objets, vertical
arrows, and vertical 2-cells. Moreover cubes compose in all three
directions : horizontally along common vertical 2-cells, and
vertically along common horizontal 2-cells, and in the front-to-back
direction along common cells.

I now believe, this is a case of what is called a 3-fold category
(what I called a "triple category" before), where all arrows in one
direction are identities making the double categories sharing this
dimension into 2-categories.

All the best,
Ondrej
