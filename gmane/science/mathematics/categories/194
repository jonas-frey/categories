Description

The general purpose of the project CHOCO is to investigate
the syntactic, semantic and algebraic aspects of proof theory
in order to integrate concurrency theory in the Curry-Howard
correspondence between proofs and programs.

The interdisciplinary nature of the project between proof theory
and concurrency theory means that candidates from various
scientific horizons are welcome to apply. On the other hand,
we will consider with special interest applications by candidates
with background in one or several of the fields:

- linear logic (proof nets, geometry of interaction)
- semantics (game semantics, vectorial semantics)
- concurrency theory (process calculi, presheaf semantics)
- type theory (realizability, types for process calculi)
- rewriting theory (lambda-calculus, diagrammatic rewriting)
- category theory (categorical algebra, topos theory)

The applicant should hold a PhD or be about to defend
his/her PhD thesis by December 2009.

The postdoc researcher will work within the laboratory PPS
(Preuves, Programmes, Systemes)

     http://www.pps.jussieu.fr

which is internationally recognized as one of the leading
research laboratories in mathematics and computer science,
with its distinctive proof-theoretic culture.

The laboratory PPS is located in Chevaleret, the largest research
community of mathematicians in France. The laboratory PPS
is also part of the Fondation Sciences Mathematiques de Paris.

http://www.sciencesmath-paris.fr

Strong interaction of the postdoc researcher with the partner sites
of the CHOCO project is also expected:

- Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris Nord.
- Laboratoire d'Informatique du Parallelisme, Lyon,
- Laboratoire de Mathematiques de l'Universite de Savoie, Chambery
- Institut de Mathematiques de Luminy, Marseille,
- Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Marseille,

Further information will possibly be made available
from the web page of the project indicated above.
