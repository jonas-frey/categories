Trivial objects should NOT be admitted to categories A whose set valued fun=
ctors should form a combinatorial topos intended as a  surrogate for contin=
uous spaces in some sense.That is to say=2C there is a reason why the delta=
  of simplicial sets does not have a unit object (unlike the delta that as a=
  strict monoid in CAThas precisely all monads as its actions). Similarly th=
e basic cubical sets are functors on the part A of the algebraic category o=
f two nullary operations which consist of finitely presented STRICT algebra=
s=3B thus this is the classifying topos for bipointed objects (in arbitrary=
  toposes) toposes that satisfy the non-equational entailment    csub0 =3Dcsub=
1 entails false.The reason is this: if a site C=3DAop has an initial object=
  =2C then the leftadjoint to the inclusion of constant functors =2C which s=
hould model the notion of connected  components=2C is representable =2C hen=
ce preserves equalizers=3B but the basic intuitive examples of spaces withn=
on-trivial higher connectivity are constructed as equalizers betweenconnect=
ed spaces  !
( Note that restrictions (on the structures classified) involving falsity=
=2C disjunction=2C or existential quantification typically give sheaf topos=
esbut exceptionally may just give smaller presheaf categories =3B another e=
xample is in algebraic geometry where classifying the algebrassubject to th=
e disjunctive conditionx^2=3Dx entails x=3D0 or x=3D1merely involves the to=
pos of all presheaves on those fp algebras satisfying the same condition.)
According to the paradigm set by Milnor=2C the relation between continuous =
and combinatorial is a pair of adjoint functors called traditionally singul=
ar and realization . ("Singular"=2C as emphasized by Eilenberg=2C means tha=
t the figures on which the combinatorial structure of a space lives should =
not be required to be monomorphisms=2Cin order that in order that that stru=
cture should be functorial wrt all continuous changes of space =3B "realiza=
tion" refers to a process  analogous to to the passage from blueprints to a=
ctual buildings of beton and steel).As emphasized by Gabriel and Zisman=2C =
the exactness of realizationforces us to refine the default notion of space=
  itself=2C in the directionproposed by Hurewicz in the late 40s and well-de=
scribed by J L Kelley in 1955. Further refinements suggest that the notion =
of continuous could well be taken as a topos=2C of a cohesive (or gros) kin=
d.The exactness of realization is a example of the striving to make the sur=
rogate combinatorial topos (=3D having a site with finite homs ???) describ=
e the continuous category as closely as possible. For example the finite pr=
oducts of combinatorial intervals might be required to admit the diagonal m=
aps that their realizations have.
There is one point however where perfect agreement cannot be achieved ( Is =
this a theorem?) : the contrast between continuous and combinatorialforced =
Whitehead to introduce a specific notion he called weak equivalence=2C as e=
xplained by Gabriel-Zisman=2C in order to extract the correct homotopy cate=
gory. The contrast can readily be read off of my list of axioms for Cohesio=
n (TAC) : the reasonable combinatorial toposes satisfy all but one of the a=
xioms=2Cbut only the continuous examples satisfy it. That Continuity axiom =
(preservationof infinite products by pizero) was introduced in order to obt=
ain  homotopytypes that are "qualities" in an intuitive sense (as they shou=
ld be automaticallyin the continuous case).=20
