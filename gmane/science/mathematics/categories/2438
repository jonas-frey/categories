CALL FOR PAPERS
AMAST 2004: 10th International Conference on
Algebraic Methodology And Software Technology
http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/events/amast2004/
Paper Submissions: 19th January 2004
---------------------------------------------

AMAST 2004
July 12th - 16th, 2004
Stirling, Scotland, UK.

SPEAKERS
--------
* Roland Backhouse (Nottingham)
* Don Batory (Texas)
* Michel Bidoit (CNRS)
* Muffy Calder (Glasgow)
* Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen)
* JJ Meyer (Utrecht)

The major goal of the AMAST Conferences is to promote research that may
lead to the setting of software technology on a firm, mathematical
basis. This goal is achieved by a large international cooperation with
contributions from both academia and industry. The virtues of a software
technology developed on a mathematical basis have been envisioned as
being capable of providing software that is (a) correct, and the
correctness can be proved mathematically, (b) safe, so that it can be
used in the implementation of critical systems, (c) portable, i.e.,
independent of computing platforms and language generations, and (d)
evolutionary, i.e., it is self-adaptable and evolves with the problem
domain.


TOPICS
------
As in previous years, we will invite papers reporting original research
on setting software technology on a firm mathematical basis. We expect
two kinds of submissions for this conference: technical papers and
system demonstrations. Of particular interest is research on using
algebraic, logic, and other formalisms suitable as foundations for
software technology, as well as software technologies developed by means
of logic and algebraic methodologies. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to, the following:

SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY:

    * systems software technology
    * application software technology
    * concurrent and reactive systems
    * formal methods in industrial software development
    * formal techniques for software requirements, design
    * evolutionary software/adaptive systems

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY:

    * logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms
    * constraint programming and concurrency
    * program verification and transformation
    * programming calculi
    * specification languages and tools
    * formal specification and development case studies

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS:

    * logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra
    * algebraic foundations for languages and systems, coinduction
    * theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning
    * logics of programs

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers):

    * software development environments
    * support for correct software development
    * system support for reuse
    * tools for prototyping
    * component based software development tools
    * validation and verification
    * computer algebra systems
    * theorem proving systems


PUBLICATION
-----------
As in the past, the proceedings of AMAST 2004 will be published by
Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

We invite prospective authors to submit electronically previously
unpublished papers of high quality. Submissions should not have been
published and should not be under consideration for publication
elsewhere.  Papers must be no longer than 15 pages (6 pages for
system demonstrations) and should be prepared using LaTeX and the
LNCS style that can be downloaded from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

Please send a fully self-contained PostScript file to
amast@cs.stir.ac.uk. If for any reason it is impossible to submit
a paper electronically, authors should send six copies of their
submission to the program chair at the address below. All papers
will be refereed by the programme committee, and will be judged based
on their significance, technical merit, and relevance to the
conference. Papers should be received by January 19, 2004.

Address for non-electronic submissions:
Charles Rattray
AMAST'2004 Program Chair
Department of Computing Science and Mathematics
University of Stirling
Stirling
FK9 4LA
UK


PRIZES
------
There will be a prize for the best paper overall, and for the best
student paper.  These prizes are sponsored by BCS-FACS (the British
Computing Society special interest group Formal Aspects of Computing
Science).  Each prize winner will receive a year's membership of
BCS-FACS and a year's subscription to the Formal Aspects of
Computing journal.


IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
* Paper submissions: January 19, 2004.
* Notification of paper acceptance: March 1, 2004
* Camera ready papers due: April 5, 2004
* AMAST'2004 Conference: July 12-16, 2004


LOCATION
--------
The conference will be held at the University of Stirling
