Special Session "New Directions in Category Theory"? - Call for Speakers=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
October 18-19, 2014, the Fall 2014 AMS Eastern Sectional Meeting is held in=
   Halifax, NS.=0A=
We are organizing a special session entitled "New directions in category th=
eory" and would like to invite those=0A=
who are interested in speaking to contact us. It will be helpful for us if =
you include a title, but that is not necessary.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
Unfortunately, the AMS does not provide travel funds for speakers, but ther=
e is travel funding for graduate students (and a reduced registration rate)=
   so we encourage any interested graduate students to attend this meeting (=
and give talks!). The website with further details (including the applicati=
on procedure and deadline) about this funding is  http://www.ams.org/studen=
t-travel.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
Since we don't expect people to want to travel out east twice this October =
we have decided that this session will replace the=0A=
=0A=
Octoberfest in Category Theory for this year, and we will plan a dinner for=
   the participants in this session on Saturday evening.=0A=
