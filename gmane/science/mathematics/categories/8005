MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

The fifth workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming
is devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of remarkable
power and abstraction. Where would Haskell be without monads? Functional
reactive programming without arrows? Call-by-push-value without
adjunctions? The list goes on. This workshop is a forum for researchers
who seek to reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.

Best regards,
Neelakantan Krishnaswami and Paul Blain Levy
