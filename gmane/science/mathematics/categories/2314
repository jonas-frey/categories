John Harrison (the creator of HOL Light) has a very coherent, but
pragmatic philosophy of mathematics. Let us see how much can we do with
constructive logic, without getting rid of the classical principles: Add
them at the end, so that if someone really needs it, they can use it. This
is a philosophy quite widespread in Cambridge, with Peter Johnstone's
books being the paradigmatic example. If classical reasoning is needed,
it's used, but flagged.

I also agree with Till that it's a cute example.

Best,
Valeria

I did not want to deny the need of mathematical thought, but I found this example of topos theory emerging unexpectedly quite pleasing.

Note that the mail is *not* about Isabelle. Admittedly, I do not know anything about the quoted system HOL light, so I have not verified Slind's claim.
