                 4th International Conference on
           LOGICAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
                        June 27 -- 29, 2001

HISTORY

The LACL series of conferences aims at providing a forum for the
presentation and discussion of current research in all the formal
and logical aspects of computational linguistics.  It started as a 
workshop held in Nancy (France), in 1995.  Due to its success, it 
was turned, the next year, into a international conference.  LACL'96 
and'97 have both been held in Nancy (France).  LACL'98 has been held 
in Grenoble (France).  Selected papers from LACL'95 appear in a special
issue of Journal of Logic Language and Information, 7(4), 1998.
The proceedings of LACL'96 and 97 appear as volumes 1328 and 1582
of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence.  The proceedings of LACL'98
are in press with the same series.


SCOPE

Typical topics include, but are not limited to:

   Categorial grammars, Categorial type logics, Compositionality, 
   Discourse representation theory, Dynamics, Feature Logics, 
   Formal language theory, Game-theoretical semantics, Grammatical 
   inference, Learning theory, Linear logical frameworks, Minimalism, 
   Modal logics, Montague semantics, Parsing as deduction, Proof-
   theoretic approaches, Situation semantics and situation theory,
   Type-theoretic approaches.
