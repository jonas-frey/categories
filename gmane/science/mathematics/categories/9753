SECOND SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 2)

University of Strathclyde, Glasgow
        17-18 December, 2018

      http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vicaryjo/syco/2/

The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an interdisciplinary
series of meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers
interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and
abstract perspectives, and in particular where category theory serves as a
unifying common language. The first SYCO was held at the School of Computer
Science, University of Birmingham, 20-21 September, 2018, attracting 70
participants.

We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science,
mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering
friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge
between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature research and work
in progress, and by both established academics and junior researchers,
including students.

Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions. The
meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has
been submitted or published elsewhere.

While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions with
a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in particular
from the perspective of category theory:

  - logical methods in computer science, including classical and quantum
programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language processing and
machine learning;
  - graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and reaction
networks;
  - languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets, type
theory and game semantics;
  - abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal category
theory, higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and relationships to
homotopy theory;
  - quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation theory=
;
  - tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof
assistants, and game theory;
  - industrial applications, including case studies and real-world problem
descriptions.

This new series aims to bring together the communities behind many previous
successful events which have taken place over the last decade, including
"Categories, Logic and Physics", "Categories, Logic and Physics
(Scotland)", "Higher-Dimensional Rewriting and Applications", "String
Diagrams in Computation, Logic and Physics", "Applied Category Theory",
"Simons Workshop on Compositionality", and the "Peripatetic Seminar in
Sheaves and Logic".

SYCO will be a regular fixture in the academic calendar, running regularly
throughout the year, and becoming over time a recognized venue for
presentation and discussion of results in an informal and friendly
atmosphere. To help create this community, and to avoid the need to make
difficult choices between strong submissions, in the event that more
good-quality submissions are received than can be accommodated in the
timetable, the programme committee may choose to *defer* some submissions
to a future meeting, rather than reject them. This would be done based
largely on submission order, giving an incentive for early submission, but
would also take into account other requirements, such as ensuring a broad
scientific programme. Deferred submissions would be accepted for
presentation at any future SYCO meeting without the need for peer review.
This will allow us to ensure that speakers have enough time to present
their ideas, without creating an unnecessarily competitive reviewing
process. Meetings would be held sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog
of deferred papers.


# INVITED SPEAKERS
Corina Cirstea, University of Southampton
Matha Lewis, University of Amsterdam


# IMPORTANT DATES

All times are anywhere-on-earth.

  - Submission deadline: Friday 16 November 2018
  - Author notification: Friday 23 November 2018
  - Travel funding application deadline: Wednesday 28 November 2018
  - Registration deadline: Friday 7 December 2018
  - Symposium dates: Monday 17 December and Tuesday 18 December 2018


# SUBMISSIONS

Submission is by EasyChair, via the following link:

   - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsyco2

Submissions should present research results in sufficient detail to allow
them to be properly considered by members of the programme committee, who
will assess papers with regards to significance, clarity, correctness, and
scope. We encourage the submission of work in progress, as well as mature
results. There are no proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has
been previously published, or has been submitted for consideration
elsewhere. There is no specific formatting requirement, and no page limit,
although for long submissions authors should understand that reviewers may
not be able to read the entire document in detail.


  # FUNDING

Some funding is available to cover travel and subsistence costs, with a
priority for PhD students and junior researchers. To apply for this
funding, please contact the local organizer Fredrik Nordvall Forsberg at
fredrik.nordvall-forsberg@strath.ac.uk with a short statement of your
current status, travel costs and funding required. The application deadline
is Wednesday 28 November, in the week after author notifications.
