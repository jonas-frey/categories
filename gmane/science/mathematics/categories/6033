Thank you Peter and Andr=E9
and all the participants of the discussion. It is indeed very helpful.

I guess it applies both to the tensor and to the sum as well as to any=20
other case where we need to form a span of monad morphism: S -> R <- T=20
and which precisely can not be formed in this case.

It looks like there are two counterexamples, both of which are based on=20
the construction of tricky underlying categories. But what about=20
existence of the tensor over Sets? I guess this is still open.  I tried=20
to think about the tensor product of a continuation monad with itself as=20
a possible counterexample, without any success though. Usually,=20
continuation monad performs well when it comes to constructing=20
counterexamples but it is difficult to see what the tensor product of it=20
with itself  is supposed to look like.

Thanks again,
Sergey.
