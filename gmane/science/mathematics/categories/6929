Ellis,

I'd say "yes".  For example, most people have a fairly good spacial
perception but individuals appearing unable to imagine a two or three
dimensional image exist.

Isn't this a question of neuroscience rather than of mathematics?
Neuroscience is barely established as a discipline.  Without intending
any offense, the subject has far to go before it can explain phenomena
such as intuition.  The question of how intuition works at present is
perhaps analogous to the question of how planets move in the sky, asked
in the year 1400.  Celestial mechanics required roughly five centuries
to "sort out".  Intuition might take even longer.

Best regards,              ... Peter E.
