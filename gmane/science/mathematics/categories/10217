I think it interesting to know that categories are now apparently used in R=
amsey theory, one of the last places I would have expected it: https://arxi=

[1506.01221] Categorical Constructions and the Ramsey Property<https://arxi=
v.org/abs/1506.01221>
It has become obvious in the recent development that the structural Ramsey =
property is a categorical property: it depends not only on the choice of ob=
jects, but also on the choice of morphisms involved. In this paper we expli=
citely put the Ramsey property and the dual Ramsey property in the context =
of categories of finite structures and investigate the invariance of these =
properties under some ...
