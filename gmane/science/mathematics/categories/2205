Here is some more information on the question of Andrei Popescu. In the
paper "Projectives are free for nilpotent algebraic theories" by T.
Pirashvili (pages 589-599 in: Algebraic $K$-theory and its applications.
Proceedings of the workshop and symposium, ICTP, Trieste, Italy, September
1-19, 1997. World Scientific, Singapore (1999)) it is shown that if
projectives are free in the category of internal abelian groups of a
sufficiently nice (e. g. Maltsev) variety, then the same holds for the
category of all nilpotent (in the sense of commutator calculus) algebras in
that variety. This is derived from the fact that one can lift splittings of
idempotents along a linear extension of algebraic theories.
