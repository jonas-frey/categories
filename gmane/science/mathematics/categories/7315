I am not certain that is a good example, actually. The membership relation =
is certainly what gives the structure of a model of ZFC, so it may be relev=
ant to morphisms between such models. However, it does not have to have any=
thing to do with the structure of individual sets.

The structure of a single set is, I believe, most fruitfully thought of as =
just consisting of the identity relation on its elements. That way, the mor=
phisms come out as functions (i.e. identity-preserving total relations), ju=
st as we expect them to.

Best wishes,
Staffan

The most common example: sets. The structure is based on membership.
Virtually no one ever wants to restrict attention to functions that respect
(preserve or reflect) membership (other than "preserve" between ordinals).
