This can be done, although you get a more general notion:
a _Cauchy_space_ (or locale, but spaces have a bigger literature).
Note that a uniform space is a Cauchy space with extra ~structure~;
there is no way, in a mere Cauchy space,
to compare sizes of neighbourhoods of different points.

For the basic definition, you could do worse than the English Wikipedia:
< http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_space >.
I had some references (monographs) that I liked too,
but I can't find them now; perhaps I can find them tomorrow.
