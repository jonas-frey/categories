We currently have two vacancies within the MSP group at the University
of Strathclyde:

*) a 1-year post-doc position funded by the EPSRC project "Coalgebraic
Foundations of Semi-Structured Data"
*) a 3.5 year PhD studentship that is fully funded for EU students

Details about the post-doc and the application procedure can be found
here: https://bit.ly/1KLxjMz

Details about the PhD studentship follow below. Anyone interested in
these positions should feel free to contact me with questions.

All the best,
Clemens

***                  Coalgebra for Data and Games

***         Mathematically Structured Programming Group

******************************************************************

Applications are invited for PhD study under the supervision of Dr
Clemens Kupke and Prof Neil Ghani in coalgebra, category theory and
logic with special focus on coalgebraic fixpoint logics and their
applications in databases and economic game theory. The position is
fully funded for EU students and will last for 3.5 years.

The successful applicant will have a good degree or an MSc in
Mathematics or Computer Science or a related subject with a strong
Mathematics or Computer Science component. Ideally, they will also have
a strong, documented interest in doing research. Strong mathematical
background and problem-solving skills are essential.

The Mathematically Structured Programming Group's vision is to use
mathematics to understand the nature of computation, and to then turn
that understanding into the next generation of programming languages.
This reflects the symbiotic relationship between mathematics,
programming, and the design of programming languages --- any attempt to
sever this connection will diminish each component. In order to achieve
these research goals we mainly use ideas from category theory, logic,
type theory and functional programming. Besides Prof Neil Ghani and Dr
Clemens Kupke, the group consists of a number of internationally leading
researchers including Dr Robert Atkey, Dr James Chapman,
Dr Ross Duncan, Dr Conor McBride and Dr Fredrik Nordvall Forsberg as
well as a number of PhD students.

The University of Strathclyde (http://www.strath.ac.uk) is located in
the heart of Glasgow, which RoughGuides praises to be "a cultured,
vibrant and irrepressibly sociable place" with "some of the
best-financed and most imaginative museums and galleries in Britain"
(http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/europe/scotland/glasgow-clyde/). Southern
Scotland provides a particularly stimulating environment for researchers
in theoretical computer science, with active groups in this area at
Heriot-Watt University, the University of Edinburgh, the University of
Glasgow, the University of St. Andrews, and the University of Strathclyde.

Anyone interested should contact Dr Clemens Kupke whose email address is
"clemens.kupke at strath.ac.uk"  and outline their academic background.
Applications will be considered starting from 29 February 2016.
