Dear Jean,

Talking about the comparison, I had in mind mainly the following: the
vertical-cartesian factorization for a fibration is closely related to the
reflective factorization system for a semi-left-exact reflection (one might
vaguely say "they are the same up to an isomorphism under the assumptions
used in both of them").

Concerning the older discussion on fibrations versus indexed categories:
Please believe me that I fully agree with every instance of "fibrations are
better" you mention. Nevertheless I also agree with "indexed categories are
better", in a different sense. The reason I am saying this now is that I
would like to mention semi-left-exact reflections of Cassidy--Hebert--Kelly
and their generalizations as a THIRD APPROACH (I used them independently
calling them "admissible" in Galois theory, first exactly in 1984).

Best regards,
George
