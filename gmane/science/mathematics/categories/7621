This is to announce a downloadable, slightly revised version of a =20
1988 preprint:

       Marco Grandis, Cohesive categories and manifolds, Dip. Mat. =20
Univ. Genova, Preprint 76 (1988),

published in 1990:

       =96, Cohesive categories and manifolds, Ann. Mat. Pura Appl. 157 =20=

(1990), 199-244.

The revised version of the preprint can be found at:

       http://www.dima.unige.it/~grandis/Chm.Pr1988(Rev.2013).pdf

In the present version the text has been slightly modified, to make =20
it less concise and clearer. Moreover, in the proof of the "cohesive =20
completion theorem" (Section 9.2) a correction has been inserted, =20
that was published in:

       =96, Cohesive categories and manifolds - Errata Corrige, Ann. =20
Mat. Pura Appl. 179 (2001), 471-472.

With best regards

Marco Grandis

________________________

 	The purpose of this article is to treat structures, like =
manifolds, =20
fibre bundles and foliations, that can be obtained by glueing =20
together 'elementary spaces' of a given kind. These structures are =20
here defined by a sort of glueing atlas, and - formally - as =20
symmetric enriched categories over suitable 2-categories. Their =20
morphisms are defined as 'compatible profunctors'.

 	The basis of the enrichment, called 'cohesive' and 'e-cohesive =20=

categories', are equipped with an order and a compatibility relation; =20=

they extend inverse categories and the categories of partial =20
mappings. Two completion theorems, with respect to compatible joins =20
and the glueing of 'manifolds', play a crucial role.
 	This matter was presented at the meeting 'Categorical Topology', =
=20
Prague 1988 (see [G4]) and is developed in the present work. =20
Applications to partially defined operators between Banach spaces =20
were given in [G5], also published in 1990.
 	The links of this setting with Ehresmann's pseudogroups [E1, E2] =
and =20
Lawvere's view of mathematical structures as enriched categories [La] =20=

are examined in the Introduction. Dominical categories and p-=20
categories, that are also related with partial mappings and were =20
previously introduced in the 1980's by Heller, Di Paola and Rosolini =20
[He, Di, DH, Ro], have a natural e-cohesive structure (see Section =20
3.8). Later, e-cohesive categories have also been used under the name =20=

of 'restriction categories' and equivalent axioms.=
