Indeed, but in this case it is the objects of the category which are
"compact," not the category itself.  So if this is the argument, then
a more natural term would be "locally compact" (clashing with "locally
small," of course, but agreeing with "locally presentable" categories
in which all objects are presentable).

(I am *not* proposing to *actually* use "locally compact" -- I don't
want to introduce yet another name for something that already has at
least four names, even if none of the existing four are optimal.)
