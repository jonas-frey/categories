	POSTDOCTORAL POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT

Dear categorists :

Hopefully the following is of interest. The post is not exclusively =20
category-theoretic, but should be suitable for people with a =20
background in category theory from either a theoretical computer =20
science or quantum mechanical perspective.

----------------------------

Applications are invited for a 3 year appointment on a project funded =20=

by the EPSRC into the fundamentals of low level quantum computation =20
and applications.

The project is led by Professor Sam Braunstein, and you will work =20
with partners on the project in Mathematics at Heriot-Watt, =20
Manchester and Newcastle and in Computer Science at Glasgow and =20
Newcastle.

You must have a relevant PhD. Ideally; you should have a background =20
in relevant areas of either Mathematics or theoretical Computer =20
Science as well as research experience in quantum computing. Previous =20=

research experience is highly desirable, and you will be expected to =20
work independently and contribute to the overall direction of the =20
research project, as well as assisting with coordination between the =20
various participating institutions.

The project aims to establish a coherent and natural framework for =20
low level quantum processing, analogous to the framework for =20
classical computation provided by low-level computational models such =20=

as state machines, transition systems, petri nets, etc. The framework =20=

developed will be applied to algorithms in group theory, cryptography =20=

and secure distributed computation. For more information about the =20
proposed work see http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/~schmuel/proposal.pdf

The salary will be =A326,666 per annum. The post is available from =20
January 2008 for a period of up to three years.
