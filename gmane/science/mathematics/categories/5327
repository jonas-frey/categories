Seminar at Liverpool University School of Mathematical Sciences, 4
December, 2009

What is and what should be `Higher dimensional group theory'?

ABSTRACT: The presentation will show, including some knot demos, some of
the problems and intuitions which have led to this question, and how
certain cubical algebraic structures with partial operations whose
domains are given by geometric conditions have been found quite natural
for expressing modes of  higher dimensional subdivision  and composition
which are related to long term concerns in algebraic topology.

Disclaimer: The seminar could  not in one hour answer the questions
posed in the title, or reference the literature! More information can be
obtained by a web search on "Higher dimensional algebra".
