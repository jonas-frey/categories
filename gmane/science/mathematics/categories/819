Atomic Categories

Zhaohua Luo

Abstract:

Let C be a category with a strict initial object 0. A map is called
"non-initial" if its domain is not an initial object. A non-initial
object T is called "unisimple" if for any two non-initial maps f: X -->
T and g: Y --> T there are non-initial maps r: R --> X and s: R --> Y
such that fr = gs. We say that C is an "atomic category" if any
non-initial object is the codomain of a map with a unisimple domain.
Many natural (left) categories arising in geometry are atomic (such as
the categories of sets, topological spaces, posets, coherent spaces,
Stone spaces, schemes, local ringed spaces, etc.) In this short note we
show that each atomic category carries a unique functor to the category
of sets, which plays the traditional role of "underlying functor" in
categorical geometry
