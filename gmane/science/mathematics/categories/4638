It is interesting that an answer to this question, before it was asked
here in the categories list, came up two weeks ago in a discussion I
had with Jimmie Lawson and Matthias Schroeder.

Schroeder showed recently that N^(N^N), where N is discrete and the
exponential is calculated in k-spaces, is not regular, and hence not
zero-dimensional either, which was an open problem (notice that the
compact-open topology on N^(N^N) is easily seen to be
zero-dimensional).

Lawson observed that this is isomorphic to Z^(N^N), which, with the
pointwise operations, is an abelian group in the category of k-spaces.
This gives your counter-example. Lawson also said that
counter-examples to complete regularity of k-groups where previously
known among the experts in the subject, but were more complicated
and/or artificial. (I don't know references.)

I hope this helps.
