One would suppose that the notions of literary topos and humility topos=20
were of ancient origin.  Certainly "topos" appears in Aristotle's=20
Rhetoric in the original Greek.  However its entry into the academic=20
lexicon as an English word relevant to rhetoric and other literary forms=20
would seem, as far as I've been able to tell, to have occurred at some=20
point in the 20th century.

1.  Volume Ti-Tz of the OED does not contain the word "topos," nor does=20
it appear under the entries for "humility" or "literary."  (Ordinarily=20
the OED can relied on to record just about every English word that has=20
appeared in print prior to the 20th century.)

2.  Adams Sherman Hill, Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory in=20
Harvard University from 1876 to 1904, wrote "The Foundations of=20
Rhetoric" in 1892 with no mention of the concept of topos as a notion in=20
rhetoric.

The Wikipedia article on Ernst Robert Curtius at

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Robert_Curtius

says "He is best known for his 1948 work Europ=E4ische Literatur und=20
Lateinisches Mittelalter. It was a major study of the Medieval Latin=20
literature and its effect on subsequent writing in modern European=20
languages. The book was largely responsible for introducing the literary=20
topos concept as a scholarly and critical discussion of literary=20
commonplaces."

So unless someone comes up with an earlier use, it looks like 1948 may=20
be the date, and German the language, of the first appearance of "topos"=20
outside the original Greek of Aristotle.
