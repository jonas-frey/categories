  From my perspective, the original definition of
operad was designed to produce a (nonnegatively)
filtered monad with the same algbras. That was
central to all of the early applications, although
I don't think I spelled it out categorically.
I did spell it out when using it for calculations.

The filtration on the monad C was given by subfunctors
F_jC such that the unit Id >--> C factored through F_1C
and the product CC >--> C was given by restricted
functors F_kCF_jC >--> F_{kj}C.

(I also preferred F_0C to be the constant functor at
the unit object of the underlying symmmetric monoidal
category, but that was negotiable).
