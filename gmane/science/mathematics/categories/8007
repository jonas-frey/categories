Dear Colleagues,

This is the first announcement for a Summer School on selected topics in
category theory and in algebraic topology, which will take place at the
EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, from Thursday 11 to Saturday 13 September
2014. There will be three mini-courses of 4 1/2 hours each, given by the
following lecturers:

Marino Gran (UCL), Jerome Scherer (EPFL) and Enrico Vitale (UCL)

(see the webpage of the conference at the address
http://sites.uclouvain.be/ctat2014/ for more details).

There is no conference fee to attend the Summer School; however,
registration is required.

In order to register, please send an email with your affiliation to
kathryn.hess@epfl.ch by June 15, 2014.

At the end of June documents concerning the prerequisites for the
mini-courses will be made available to the registered participants.

We look forward to seeing you in Lausanne!

Best wishes,

Kathryn Hess and Marino Gran
