I think it's a great idea and I have no objection.

Wikibooks has a draft of a book about category theory at

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category_theory

and a stub for course notes at

http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Category_Theory

It wouldn't be a good idea to simply replace what is already written there
with the intro part of TTT but some of it could be put in to cover
additional topics and provide more examples.

I have done some work on Wikipedia and need to warn you that pretty soon
what you wrote may be changed in many ways, in the small and in the large ;
if you are anal about what you write this can be upsetting.  In any case the
original TTT will remain on the web as it is.
