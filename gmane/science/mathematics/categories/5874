Urs, Andre did not say that Lurie's usage of the term (infty,1)-category
distinguishes from yours but that his usage of the term infinity-category
(note the difference) is specific to mean quasicategory: his introduction
says:

"We begin with what we feel
is the most intuitive approach to the subject, based on topological
categories. This approach is easy to
understand, but difficult to work with when one wishes to perform even
simple categorical constructions.
As a remedy, we will introduce the more suitable formalism of =E2=88=9E-cat=
egories
(called weak Kan complexes in
[10] and quasi-categories in [43]), which provides a more convenient settin=
g
for adaptations of sophisticated
category-theoretic ideas. Our goal in =C2=A71.1.1 is to introduce both appr=
oaches
and to explain why they are
equivalent to one another."
