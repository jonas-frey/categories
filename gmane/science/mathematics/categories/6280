Rereading my message, I realized I should perhaps clarify that not
just the name, but (as far as I know) the concept itself was
originated by Kelly and Lack.  The example of semigroups is also in
their paper, which is concerned mainly with the case when the
forgetful functor is also 2-monadic.  The resulting "property-like
2-monads" generalize both "lax-idempotent" (=3D "Kock-Zoberlein")
2-monads, such as those which assign colimits, and the dual
"colax-idempotent" 2-monads, such as those which assign limits.  But
they are strictly more general than either: for instance, a 2-monad
which assigns both limits and colimits is property-like, but not lax-
or colax-idempotent.
