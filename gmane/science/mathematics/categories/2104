I'm intrigued by Peter McBurney's question [below]. It looks rather like a
question of the constructive content of Brouwer's fixed point theorem.

Suppose S is (homeomorphic to) an n-cell. Then in the internal logic of the
topos of sheaves over [0,1], f is just a continuous endomap of S. If
Brouwer's theorem were constructively true then f would have a fixpoint,
and that would come out as a continuous section of the projection [0,1]xS
-> [0,1]. More precisely, it would be a map g: [0,1] -> S such that f(x,
g(x)) = g(x) for all x. If this existed then the set A = {(x, g(x))| x in
[0,1]} would be as required.

However, the proof of Brouwer that I've seen is not constructive - it goes
by contradiction. So maybe the requirements on A are a way of getting
constructive content in Brouwer's result.

What is known constructively about Brouwer's fixed point theorem?
