Dear Andre,

How would you deal with composition?

The standard account of composability - defined by equality between a
domain and a codomain - does seem to presuppose a notion of object equality.

Normally for categories internal in C one therefore takes C to have
pullbacks. Are there obvious ways to generalize that to monoidal C?

Or are you thinking you might want to relax that standard account,
perhaps even losing the well defined domain and codomain? I'm getting a
picture of things like "categories" of smooth curves, where two curves
are composable only if the end of one has an open overlap with the start
of the other. But then "objects" are more nebulous.

Regards,

Steve Vickers.
