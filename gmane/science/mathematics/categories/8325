Referring to Alex's question in Dana's original post (below):

Sorry, but I'm not seeing how this is all that different from just
picking an object A in C, contemplating all powers of A in C, and
asking about the full subcategory K (of C) of all subobjects =

of those powers?

In case C is a variety, surely that's a well-understood sort of class
of algebras (closed under products and subalgebras), n'est-ce pas?

Cheers, -- Fred
