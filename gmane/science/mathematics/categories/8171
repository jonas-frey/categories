It was my great luck to have known Jim Lambek quite well for the past 15 =
years. =20

Of course, Jim was the first one to identify categorical structures in =
the `real world', in the form of the structure of grammar with his 1956 =
paper, and as already mentioned by Andre, he pioneered many branches of =
category theory, such as categorical logic and coalgebra. =20

But even more so, Jim Lambek was also lots of fun!  He didn't take =
himself over-seriously, loved to have a laugh at the pub, and was always =
in for a genuinely funny  joke during talks.  When he first heard about =
dagger categories in a talk (which are monoidal categories with an =
involution, something which he himself considered way before), he asked =
how one was able to take these on a plane. He prides himself in that his =
greatest scientific contribution was the introduction of the symbol R =
for a ring, replacing the impossible to draw gothic symbols. =20

Unlike some in category theory land, he had a genuine interest in other =
sciences and actively contributed to them.  One of the most striking =
things is probably that in mathematical/computational linguistics his =
pioneering contributions span well over 50 years, with the release of =
his book on pregroup grammars in 2007, which have now meanwhile found =
there way into mainstream natural language processing.  The past few =
years he was working on physics related topics and he had asked me to =
take care of his papers getting publicised in the event of what just =
happened.

While the passing of a friend is of course extremely sad, Jim was a very =
happy person and has enjoyed an extremely exciting and colourful life, =
and oh boy it was fun having had a small part in that!
