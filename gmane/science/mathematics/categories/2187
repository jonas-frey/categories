Fundamentals of Computation Theory
Malmo, Sweden, August 12-15, 2003


Invited Speakers:

Sanjeev Arora, Princeton
Christos Papadimitriou, Berkeley
George Paun, Romanian Academy

Scope: Authors are invited to submit papers presenting
original and unpublished research in all areas of theoretical
computer science. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

design and analysis of algorithms, abstract data types, approximation
algorithms, automata and formal languages, categorical and topological
approaches, circuits, computational and structural complexity, circuit
and proof theory, computational biology (new), computational geometry,
computer systems theory, concurrency theory, cryptography, domain theory,
distributed algorithms and computation, molecular computation,
quantum computation and information, granular computation,
probabilistic computation, learning theory, rewriting, semantics,
logic in computer science, specification, transformation and verification,
algebraic aspects of computer science.

Submissions:

Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of their papers,
    presenting original contributions to the theory of computer
    science. All papers should be submitted in electronic form
    (in Postscript) to Andrzej.Lingas@cs.lth.se.

Authors from countries where access to the Internet is difficult should
    contact the chair of the programme committee using the address:
    Andrzej Lingas,
    Department of Computer Science,
    Lund University,
    Box 118,
    SE-221 00 Lund,

Proceedings: Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings
of the symposium (Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag).
Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings
is not allowed.

Tradition: The symposium on Fundamentals of Computation Theory  was establi
shed in 1977 as a biennial event for researchers interested in all aspects
of theoretical computer science, in particular in algorithms, complexity,
and formal and logical methods. The previous FCT conferences were held
in the following cities:
Poznan (Poland, 1977), Wendisch-Rietz (Germany, 1979),
Szeged (Hungary, 1981), Borgholm (Sweden, 1983),
Cottbus (Germany, 1985), Kazan (Russia, 1987),
Szeged (Hungary, 1989), Gosen-Berlin (Germany, 1991),
Szeged (Hungary, 1993), Dresden (Germany, 1995),=20
Krakow (Poland, 1997), Iasi (Romania, 1999) and Riga (Latvia, 2001).

The 14-th International Symposium on Fundamentals of Computation Theory is
organized jointly by Lund University and Malmo Hogskolan.
