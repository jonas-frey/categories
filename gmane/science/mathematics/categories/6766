 	Ronnie:

 		No doubt the project you have described is an excellent one, but
"propose that the article be replaced" just isn't how Wikipedia works -
let alone "should be written by a chosen group of experts."

 	This is like suggesting that a school talent show would be better if
instead of having all those random kids singing & dancing they hired
some real professionals.  Or like saying MacDonald's would be a great
restaurant if they ditched the burgers and chips.

 	There's nothing stopping you from putting together the project you
describe; and some parts of it could be accomplished on Wikipedia. But
why?  It could not be exactly what you want, and conversely you don't
seem to think the Wikipedia model is very useful for what you would like
to do.  There are lots of other Internet service providers out there.

 	Cheers,
 		Robert
