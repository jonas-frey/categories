Dear Colleagues

The Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering is publishing a =20
special issue on subjects related to bialgebras. I am a guest editor =20
handling such papers with a categorical emphasis. If you are planning =20=

to write a paper in the area in the next half year, or have one ready =20=

for submission, please consider answering the call for papers below.

Best wishes,
Ross


THE ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

Call for Papers: Theme Issue on Interactions of Algebraic & =20
Coalgebraic Structures
(Theory and Applications)

The editorial board of the =93Arabian Journal for Science and =20
Engineering (AJSE)=94 plans to publish in December 2008, an issue which =20=

contains the latest developments in the theory and applications of =20
=93Algebraic & Coalgebraic Structures=94 and their interactions. The aim =
=20
is to produce a collection of papers on the subject from diverse =20
disciplines and areas of interest, including:
	=95 Algebras and Coalgebras 		=95 Hopf Algebras
	=95 Corings and Comodules 		=95 Bialgebroids & Hopf =
Algebroids
	=95 Quantum and Lie Groups 		=95 Non-commutative =
Geometry
	=95 Categorical Aspects 			=95 Applications =
in Physics
	=95 Applications in Logic, Universal Algebra & Computer Science
