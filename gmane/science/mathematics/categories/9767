              CALL FOR PAPERS:  CALCO 2019

            8th International Conference on
         Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science

                     June 3-6, 2019

                       London, UK

          https://www.coalg.org/calco-mfps-2019/

==========================================================
Abstract submission:  April 3, 2019
Paper submission:     April 8, 2019
Author notification:  May 13, 2019
Final version due:    May 27, 2019
==========================================================

SCOPE
---------

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with
interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging
uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science.

It is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces
and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic
Methods in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic
Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in
Swansea (Wales, 2005), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Udine (Italy, 2009),
Winchester (UK, 2011), Warsaw (Poland, 2013),
Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), and Ljubljana (Slovenia,2017).

The eighth edition will be held in London, UK, colocated with MFPS XXXV.

INVITED SPEAKERS -- SPECIAL SESSION
-----------------------------------------

CALCO will have three invited speakers, and a joint special session
with MFPS.

SUBMISSIONS
--------------

CALCO invites three categories of submissions:

* Full technical papers that report
   - results of theoretical work on the mathematics of algebras
     and coalgebras,
   - the way these results can support methods and techniques for
     software development, as well as
   - experience with the transfer of the resulting technologies
     into industrial practice.

* Early ideas abstracts that lead to presentation of work in progress
   and original research proposals. PhD students and young researchers
   are particularly encouraged to contribute.

* Tool papers that report on the development and use of tools for
   algebraic and coalgebraic methods in computer science.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:

* Abstract models and logics
    - Automata and languages
    - Categorical semantics
    - Graph transformation
    - Modal logics

    - Term rewriting

* Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
    - Abstract data types
    - Inductive and coinductive methods
    - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation)
    - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques

* Role of algebraic and coalgebraic methods in software and
   systems engineering
    - Development processes with algebraic and coalgebraic methods
    - Method integration
    - Usage guidelines

* Specialised models and calculi
    - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems
    - Models and calculi of concurrent, distributed, mobile,
      cyber-physical, and context-aware computing
    - Systems theory and computational models (chemical,biological,etc.)

* String diagrams and network theory
    - Combinatorial approaches
    - Theory of PROPs and operads
    - Rewriting problems and higher-dimensional approaches
    - Automated reasoning with string diagrams
    - Applications of string diagrams
    - Connections with control theory, engineering, and concurrency

* System specification and verification
    - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification
    - Formal testing and quality assurance
    - Generative programming and model-driven development
    - Integration of formal specification techniques
    - Model-driven development
    - Process algebra
    - Specification languages, methods, and environments
    - Validation and verification

* Tools supporting algebraic and coalgebraic methods for
    - Advances in automated verification
    - Model checking
    - Theorem proving
    - Testing ???

* Quantum computing with algebra and coalgebra
    - Categorical semantics for quantum computing
    - Quantum calculi and programming languages
    - Foundational structures for quantum computing
    - Applications of quantum algebra

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
------------------------

All submissions will be handled via EasyChair.

### Full technical papers ###

Prospective authors are invited to submit full technical papers in
English presenting original research. Submitted papers must be
unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Experience
papers are welcome, but they must clearly present general lessons
learned that would be of interest and benefit to a broad audience of
both researchers and practitioners.

Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz
International Proceedings in Informatics series. Final papers should
be 12-15 pages long (excluding the bibliography and a brief appendix of
up to 5 pages from this page limit) in the format specified by LIPIcs
http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/
(most likely there will be a release of a new version of the style in
early 2019: lipics-v2019).

It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length.
Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately.
Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included in a clearly
marked appendix. Both an abstract and the full paper must be submitted
by their respective submission deadlines. At least one of the authors
must attend the conference to present the paper.

A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in
Computer Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), containing extended
versions of selected papers, is also being planned.


### Early ideas abstracts ###

Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs
http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/
(most likely there will be a release of a new version of the style in
early 2019: lipics-v2019).

The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on
the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged
to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere. At least
one of the authors must attend the conference to present the work.


### Tool papers ###

Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs
http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/
(most likely there will be a release of a new version of the style in
early 2019: lipics-v2019).

The accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of
the conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the
time of submission for download and evaluation. Each submission will be
evaluated by at least three reviewers, and one or more of the reviewers
will be asked to download and use the tool. At least one of the authors
of each tool paper must attend the conference to demonstrate the tool.


BEST PAPER AND BEST PRESENTATION AWARDS
--------------------------------------------

This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose
recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a
Best Presentation Award, elected by the participants.
