There are situations where standard completion constructions are =
insufficient to accurately describe the relationship between two =
categories. The motivating example in the paper "Relative completions" =
(JPAA 192, 2004) was the presentation of the Effective topos as an exact =
completion of the category of partitioned assemblies. This presentation =
relies on the axiom of choice in Sets, and therefore does not work when =
we work over an arbitrary base topos. The solution is to define a =
relative version of the exact completion which preserves quotients of =
equivalence relations coming from the base topos. More precisely, it is =
defined by first freely adding all quotients, but then formally =
inverting the canonical comparison morphisms between the new quotients =
and the old ones from the base.

Best regards,
Pieter

I can indicate two important uses of non-free cocompletions, and more
precisely cocompletions for particular classes of diagrams preserving
some given colimits:

1. The construction of what, with Charles, we called the "prototype"
and the "type" associated to a sketch (in "Categories of sketchd
structures", Cahiers Top. et Geom. Diff. III-2, 1972)

2. The "complexification process" which, with Jean-Paul Vanbremeersch,
we use extensively in our model for hierarchical evolutionary systems
("Memory Evolutive Systems: Hierarchy, Emergence, Cognition", Elsevier
2007)

Andree
