Dear Patrik,

Categorical logic can interpret, but doesn't rigidly follow, the
standard logical path of signature, formula and sentence to reach theory
= signature + sentences.

I guess that's the path you had in mind that underlies your question,
and it is also the path that influenced Goguen and Meseguer.

Even where categorical logic interprets that standard path, it can move
away from the "Hilbert-style" idea that a sentence is a formula with no
free variables. Look in Elephant part C (?) and you'll see that the
sentences there are sequents in context.

But categorical logic goes further than ordinary logic in its attempt to
define 'theory'. Think of a category as loosely motivated by sets. The
set constructions that logic most directly accesses - as formulae - are
subsets of finite products (of carriers). It struggles to get to other
constructions that category theory accesses quite naturally. Hence
category theory can - and does - define 'theory' in ways that seem quite
unnatural to a logician, either presented (for instance by sketches) or
completed (as classifying categories, such as Lawvere theories).

Regards,

Steve.
