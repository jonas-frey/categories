Dear Steve,

Of course, they are not.

I think about a sketch as an alternative to a string of formulae, which
represents (axioms of) a theory. I didn't try to compare sketch theory wi=
th
group theory.  I tried to compare sketch theory with the general setting,=
 in
which group theory is developed a la Bourbaki (along with many other
theories). A classical account of this general setting (which differs at =
certain
points with Bourbaki's version) is Tarski's model theory.

The notion of presentation in my understanding implies that what a given
presentation is a presentation *of* is somehow given in advance. I try to=
 think
of a sketch as a means to build a theory, not to present a ready-made the=
ory.
Perhaps *representation* is a better word for it than *presentation*.

best,
andrei
