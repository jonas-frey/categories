Given the private replies I got to yesterday's queries, it is obvious I
was not clear enough, and indeed there was an unhelpful typo.

OK Saunders, from now on they're graphs. This what happens when you hang
out with combinatorists AND category theorists.

So right from the start this is not the usual presheaf CC structure,
where the set of vertices is the set of all functions |X| --> |Y| .

So in what follows I use categorical notation for vertices, arrows, etc.

> forall  k: x-->y in X, p_1(k) : f(x)-->g(y)

Now the typo has been corrected. So an arrow f --> g is like a natural
transformation, with p_0 the usual familly of arrows indexed by the
vertices/objects of X, but since things don't compose, you add the
diagonal p_1 as part of the information. There is some kinship to
homotopies, as M. Barr has remarked.

Is this more understandable?

Thanks again
