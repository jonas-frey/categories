Hi Aleks,

I don't have a complete answer but maybe this will help:
In your example, the problem is that your diagram has several faces on the
same plane as another face. I think if you have a diagram where this does
not happen you should be fine. E.g in your example it should have been a
tetrahedron, and then the outer triangle is just another face.

Best,
Adam
