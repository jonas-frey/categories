In Spring 1969 there was a conference in Rome. In the resulting volume
of Symposia Mathematica there appear papers by David Buchsbaum, Leon
Ehrenpreis, Peter Freyd, John Gray, Ioan.James, Barry Mitchell and
Graeme Segal. Talks also were given by Jean Benabou, Charles
Ehresmann, Bill Lawvere and Saunders Mac Lane. (Among others in
attendance -- I do not specifically recall if they gave talks -- were
Yitz Herstein and John Moore.)

Bill gave his first talk on elementary topoi. My talk was on the "more
general" adjoint functor theorem (but the paper I put in the
proceedings was on the concreteness of certain categories). Jean
Benabou talked about distributors. During his talk I decided to wait
until I could check with Bill before saying anything. In what I
expected to be an entirely private conversation I then brought to
Benabou's attention -- as gently as I have ever succeeded in being
with an adult -- that in July, 1966, he and I had heard Bill give a
talk in Oberwolfach in which Bill described a kind of "generalized
functor" he called a "bimodule." Within two seconds it ceased being a
private conversation. Nothing in my mathematical career had come close
to preparing me -- or anyone else I knew at the conference -- for the
scene that then occurred.

Under the circumstances I decided not to take the opportunity to point
out that at the lunch following Bill's 1966 talk many observed Benabou
pressing him for more details about these generalized functors called
bimodules; what good were they anyway; how would one use them.
