Dear Marta,

I guess you are thinking of having the analog of Steve Lack's model =20
structure
but for the category of 2-categories internal to a Grothendieck topos S.
That is a good question. I am not aware that this has been done (but =20
my knowledge of the litterature is lacunary).
You may also want to establish the analog of Moerdijk's model =20
structure for the category of internal 2-groupoids.
I am confident that these model structure exists.
They should be closely related to a model structure on internal =20
simplicial groupoids
<A.Joyal, M.Tierney: Classifying spaces for sheaves of simplicial =20
groupoids, JPAA, Vol 89, 1993>.
And also related to the model structure on simplicial sheaves, =20
described in my letter
to Grothendieck in 1984, but unfortunately not formally published.

Best regards,
Andre

Dear Andre,I welcome your suggestion of involving stacks in order to =20
test  universality when the base topos S does not have Choice. I have =20=

been exploiting this implicitly but systematically several times since =20=

my own construction of the stack completion of a category object C in =20=

any Grothendieck topos S (Cahiers, 1979). For instance, I have used it =20=

crucially in my paper on Galois groupoids and covering morphisms =20
(Fields, 2004), not only in distinguishing between Galois groupoids =20
from fundamental groupoids, but also for a neat way of (well) defining =20=

the fundamental groupoid topos of a Grothendieck topos as the limit of =20=

a filtered 1-system of discrete groupoids, obtained from the naturally =20=

arising bifiltered 2-system of such by taking stack completions. This =20=

relates to the last remark you make in your posting. Concerning S_fin, =20=

it does not matter if, in constructing the object classifier, one uses =20=

its stack completion instead, since S is a stack (Bunge-Pare, Cahiers, =20=

1979). In my opinion, stacks should be the staple food of category =20
theory without Choice. For instance, an anafunctor (Makkai's =20
terminology) from C to D is precisely a functor from C to the stack =20
completion of D. More recently (Bunge-Hermida, MakkaiFest, 2011), we =20
have carried out the 2-analogue of the 1-dimensional case along the =20
same lines of the 1979 papers, by constructing the 2-stack completion =20=

of a 2-gerbe in "exactly the same way". Concerning this, I have a =20
question for you. Is there a model structure on 2-Cat(S) (or 2-=20
Gerbes(S)), for S a Grothedieck topos, whose weak equivalences are the =20=

weak 2-equivalence 2-functors, and whose fibrant objects are precisely =20=

the (strong) 2-stacks? Although not needed for our work, the question =20=

came up naturally after your paper with Myles Tierney. We could find =20
no such construction in the literature.  With best regards, Marta
