Dear Andre, Anne and Hanne

The community of category theorists is grieving with you.
We have lost a great member.

Myles was one of the category theorists I met for the first time at John an=
d Eva Gray's home in Urbana in November 1968. Myles is the one who walked m=
ost of the way home with me past the U Illinois Math Dept in the cold. I ev=
en remember that we talked about relative homological algebra. From the sta=
rt, I was impressed by his gentle and kind manner.=20

Since then we have had many enjoyable times together, in Australia, in Mont=
real, and at conferences. He remained gentle, kind and positive throughout =
all the terrible things, explained by Andre and Mike, that he endured.

While on sabbatical at the University of Sydney, Myles and Hanne hosted a d=
inner featuring a whole lamb cooking on a spit. For a long time Myles had w=
anted to do that. It turned out to take a bit longer to cook than expected,=
  even for Myles, who always liked his meat bloody. In the end it was a big =
success.=20

We are thankful to Myles for his immense contribution to mathematics throug=
h his individual work, his numerous collaborations, and his inspiring conve=
rsations.=20

In sympathy,
Ross=
