Dear Andre,

Can I explore this with regard to topologies?

Suppose we compare FinSet with Set, defining FinSet very small with N =20=

for its object space. The object diagonal N -> NxN is an open inclusion.

Now look at Set. The natural topology on the class of sets, as the =20
Ind-completion of FinSet, is the one whose sheaves are given by the =20
object classifier. Thus continuous maps from it are functorial and =20
preserve filtered colimits (the categorical analogue of Scott =20
continuity).

(This introduces a confusing issue. Functors from the category Set =20
are already determined by their object maps. But it is a special =20
category in which the morphism space is the comma object got from two =20=

copies of the identity map on the object space - we are using the =20
fact that the category of spaces is actually a 2-category, using the =20
specialization morphisms. FinSet was certainly not of this kind.)

Now the object diagonal is not even an inclusion, since it is not =20
full. I would speculate, by analogy with what I know for ideal =20
completions, that it is essential but not locally connected.

I don't really know what to make of this, but it does seem that there =20=

are topological distinctions to be made between the two categories =20
based on object equality.

Now let me wonder about classifying toposes.

I love using them (as I did above), but they always seem slightly =20
fuzzy because they are really defined only up to equivalence. So I =20
certainly would distrust the object equality. I think the discussion =20
becomes slightly sharper in terms of arithmetic universes (as =20
mentioned by Paul Taylor) instead of toposes.

Given a base AU A0, there are two obvious places to look for an =20
object classifier (representing the class of sets) a la Grothendieck =20
topos theory. First, there is A0[U], the AU freely generated over A0 =20
by an object U. This can be constructed by universal algebra, and =20
then is a classifying A0-AU (for the theory with one sort and no =20
predicates, functions or axioms) characterized up to isomorphism with =20=

respect to strict A0-AU homomorphisms. However, its object equality =20
depends rather delicately on the precise structure used to =20
characterized AUs. For example, I suspect it will differ according as =20=

AUs are taken to have canonical pullbacks or canonical binary =20
products and equalizers.

On the other hand, sheaf theory would suggest using the category Presh=20=

(FinSet^op) of internal diagrams over the internal FinSet in A0. I =20
conjecture that this (is an AU and) is equivalent but not isomorphic =20
to A0[U]. Hence there are issues of object equality when one compares =20=

them. (Milly Maietti and I are looking at "subspaces" in this AU =20
setting, and again are having to be rather careful about equality and =20=

the distinction between strict and non-strict AU homomorphisms.)

A further issue, seen in AUs but not toposes, is that A0[U] can be =20
internalized in A0, as the internal AU in A0 freely generated by one =20
object. The comparison with the external A0[U] will presumably raise =20
truth v. proof issues similar to those that you have already =20
investigated for the initial AU and Goedel's Theorem.

To summarize:

(1) Granted the existence of the object diagonals, they may still =20
have different topological characteristics for different kinds of =20
categories.
(2) A universal characterization (such as for classifying toposes) =20
that is only up to equivalence will make it difficult to rely on =20
object equality.
(3) In arithmetic universes we can perhaps (allowing for the fact =20
that the theory is not fully developed yet) see situations where the =20
object equality definitely exists, but is sensitive to inessential =20
differences.

Best regards,

Steve Vickers.
