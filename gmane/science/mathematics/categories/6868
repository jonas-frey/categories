Dear All,

I would like to communicate some information on the "Cahiers".

1. Last year, prompted by several people, in particular Ronnie, I had =20
asked for the inclusion of the "Cahiers" in the ISI database, and I =20
was informed that the assessment process required about 1 year. The =20
answer arrived in August: it is rejected. As I was surprised, all the =20
more since I thought TAC had been accepted, I asked for the reasons. I =20
join the answer at the end of this msg.

2. The "Cahiers" show that a journal need not be very expensive. It =20
costs 82 euros a year, and lives on its subscriptions (almost all by =20
foreign universities) which entirely and exactly cover the expenses: =20
printing of the final pdf file which I give to the (commercial) =20
printer, envelopes and stamps I use for snail mail delivery.
It should be noted that there is no staff expenses since, without any =20
financial nor material support, I myself edit the complete file (with =20
the help of the authors who kindly comply with my format =20
requirements?), and manage the subscriptions, the packing up and =20
sending of the volumes.

I am sorry of the ThomasReuters decision  which might be a prejudice =20
for the authors, I'll try to have it reversed in the future if it is =20
possible, and I hope you all will help me.

Kind regards
Andree

Dear Prof. Ehresmann,

Among the many criteria we use to evaluate a journal for possible =20
inclusion in the database, a journal's citation record (how often the =20
journal is cited and which journals cite it and are cited by it) is =20
one of the more important considerations.  We examined the citation =20
record of the Cahiers for both 2009 and 2010. (The 2010 citation data =20
became available just a few months ago).  The citation data for both =20
years show that the citation rate for the Cahiers was very low - even =20
lower in 2010 than in 2009 - and did not compare favorably with other =20
core mathematics journals indexed in the database, in particular, =20
journals covering the subject areas of topology and category.

Theory and Applications of Categories was indeed added to the database =20
earlier this year and during its evaluation demonstrated a much =20
stronger citation rate.  Many high impact journals covering the field =20
of topology, such as Topology and Its Applications, Topology and =20
Topological Methods in Nonlinear Analysis, are also indexed in the =20
database. Thus, these fields in mathematics are well represented in =20
the database.

We would be pleased to arrange a reevaluation of the journal in 36 =20
months, if you care to contact us again at that time.  (In the =20
meantime, it is not necessary to send us further issues.)  Further =20
exposure to the research community, new quantitative data and our =20
evolving coverage priorities may yield a different decision.

Sincerely,
