Dear all,=20

As part of a new growing community in Applied Category Theory, now with =
a dedicated journal Compositionality, a traveling workshop series SYCO, =
a forthcoming CUP book series Reasoning with Categories, and several =
one-off events including at NIST, we launch an annual conference+school =
series named Applied Category Theory, the coming one being at Oxford, =
July 15-19 for the conference, and July 22-26 for the school.  The dates =
are chosen such that CT 2019 (Edinburgh) and the ACT 2019 conference =
(Oxford) will be back-to-back, for those wishing to participate in both.=20=


There already was a successful invitation-only pilot last year at the =
Lorentz Centre in Leiden:
=
https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2018/969/info.php3?wsid=3D969&venue=3D=
Oort =
<https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2018/969/info.php3?wsid=3D969&venue=3D=
Oort>
also in the format of school+workshop. =20

For the conference, for those who are familiar with the successful QPL =
conference series, we will follow a very similar format for the ACT =
conference.  This means that we will accept both new papers which then =
will be published in a proceedings volume (most likely a =
Compositionality special Proceedings issue), as well as shorter =
abstracts of papers published elsewhere.  There will be a thorough =
selection process, as typical in computer science conferences.  The idea =
is that all the best work in applied category theory will be presented =
at the conference, and that acceptance is something that means =
something, just like in CS conferences.  This is particularly important =
for young people as it will help them with their careers.

Expect a call for submissions soon, and start preparing your papers now!

The school was unique in that small groups of students worked closely =
with an experienced researcher (these were John Baez, Aleks Kissinger, =
Martha Lewis and Pawel Soboci=C5=84ski), and each group ended up =
producing a paper.   We will continue with this format or a closely =
related one, with Jules Hedges and Daniel Cicala as organisers this =
year.  As there were 80 applications last year for 16 slots, we may want =
to try to find a way to involve more students.

We are fortunate to have a number of private sector companies closely =
associated in some way or another, who will also participate, with =
Cambridge Quantum Computing Inc. and StateBox having already made major =
financial/logistic contributions.

On behalf of the ACT Steering Committee,

John Baez, Bob Coecke, David Spivak, Christina Vasilakopoulou=
