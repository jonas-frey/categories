Third international workshop on Implicit Computational Complexity-2001 (ICC'01)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   (affiliated with PADO and MFPS)

The Implicit Complexity Workshop (ICC'01) will be held on Sunday, 20
May 2001 in Aarhus as part of the joint PADO/MFPS 2000 conferences.


Topics of Interest:
-------------------

The synergy between Logic, Computational Complexity and Programming
Language Theory has gained importance and vigour in recent years,
cutting across areas such as Proof Theory, Computation Theory,
Applicative Programming, and Philosophical Logic. Several
machine-independent approaches to computational complexity have been
developed, which characterize complexity classes by conceptual
measures borrowed primarily from mathematical logic. Collectively
these approaches might be dubbed IMPLICIT COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY.

Practically, implicit computational complexity provides a framework
for a streamlined incorporation of computational complexity into areas
such as formal methods in software development, programming language
theory. In addition to research reports on theoretical advances in
implicit computational complexity, practical contributions bridging
the gap between Computational Complexity and Programming Language
Theory are therefore of particular interest.
