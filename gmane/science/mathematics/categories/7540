Dear David,

We need to be clear what you mean by "fibred topos". I would take it as
bounded geometric morphism E --> S, thinking of topos as generalized
space, but Streicher has used it in a sense of functor P: X -> B that is
the fibrational analogue of B^op -> (Topos, logical functors).

If it's the first kind, the usual approach is to use classifying
toposes. So as analogue of Set_* --> Set you let S be the object
classifier (classifies the geometric theory with a single sort and
nothing else) and E classify the theory with a single sort and a
constant with that sort. The geometric morphism E --> S in effect
forgets the constant.

For a generic fibred topos you might try to have S classify sites, and E
classify sites equipped with a distinguished model. E --> S forgets the
model. But I would conjecture it's not possible to get either a
fibration or an opfibration in general - in general a site morphism does
not give a functor in either direction between the fibres (the model
categories) - and that's a nuisance.

Johnstone ("Fibrations and partial products in a 2-category", section 7)
has written about generic ones of more restricted kinds where you do get
either fibrations or opfibrations. For example, the one analogous to
Set_* --> Set is an opfibration.

A lot of my own work has been about situations where the geometric
morphism E --> B is localic - see, e.g., my "Topical categories of domains".

Best wishes,

Steve Vickers.
