From my recollections, the terminology monad was suggested by P. May
as a replacement for triple.
The terminology was intended to match with "operad".
At the time, S. Mac Lane has taken up that suggestion.
In his book "Categories for the working mathematician"
Mac Lane uses the terminology monad and comonad rather than triple
and cotriple.

If Peter May participates in this board I am sure he will react.
