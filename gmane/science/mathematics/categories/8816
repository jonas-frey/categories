Dear colleagues,

Please find below the 2nd CfP for the workshop on Semantic Spaces in
Physics and NLP jointlyorganized by the QMUL CompLing Lab, the NLIP
group at Cambridge and the Quantum Group of Oxford. The paper submission
deadline is set for 20th of March 2016. Note that we have increased the
page limit to 8 pages in order to comply with the EPTCS guidelines.

Kind regards,
Dimitri Kartsaklis

                          2nd CALL FOR PAPERS
                          -------------------
           *** Paper submission deadline: 20th of Martch ***
             *** New page limit: 8 pages (EPTCS format) ***

Since their introduction in the early 1970s, vector space models of
meaning have evolved into a well-established area of research in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). Their probabilistic nature and ability to
exploit the abundance of large-scale resources such as the Web make them
one of the most useful tools (arguably the most successful (Turney and
Pantel, 2010)) for modeling what we broadly call meaning in language.
The geometry provided by the angular distance between the vectors has
been widely used as a representative of the degree of similarity of
meaning in NLP.

Another field in which vector space models play an important role is
physics, and especially quantum theory. Though seemingly unrelated to
language, intriguing connections have recently been uncovered. Some
examples include models of compositionality in distributional semantics
(Coecke et al. 2010), treatments of logical words in vector space models
(Widdows, 2003), reasoning about the human mental lexicon in cognitive
processes (Bruza et al., 2009), using vectors of queries and documents
in information retrieval (Van Rijsbergen, 2004), and representing the
meaning of words by density operators (Piedeleu et al., 2015). There is
also a long-standing history of vector space models in cognitive science.
Theories of categorization such as those developed by Nosofsky (1986);
Smith, Osherson, Rips, & Keane, (1988), utilise notions of distance
between concepts represented as feature vectors. More recently G??rdenfors
(2004) has developed a model of concepts in which conceptual spaces
provide geometric structures, and information is represented by points,
vectors and regions in vector spaces.

Exploiting the common ground provided by the concept of a vector space,
the workshop aims to bring together researchers working at the intersection
of NLP, cognitive science, and physics, offering to them an appropriate
forum for presenting their uniquely motivated work and ideas. The interplay
between these three disciplines will foster theoretically motivated
approaches to understanding how meanings of words interact with each
other in sentences and discourse, how diagrammatic reasoning depicts and
simplifies this interaction, how language models are determined by input
from the world, and how word and sentence meanings interact logically.
Topics of interest include (but are not restricted to):

* Reasoning in semantic spaces
* Applications of quantum logic in natural language processing
* Compositionality in semantic spaces and conceptual spaces
* Links between conceptual spaces and natural language processing
* Modeling functional words such as prepositions and relative pronouns
    in compositional distributional models of meaning
* Diagrammatic reasoning for natural language processing

SUBMISSION
