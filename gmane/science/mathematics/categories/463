I started a project here at The Boeing Company three years ago whose approach 
is a categorical methodology for software synthesis from specifications.  
We are using The Kestrel Institute's Specware system, which implements category 
theory, for this purpose.  The Web site for Kestrel is http://www.kestrel.edu/, and click on Projects, then Modular Construction of Very large Knowledge 
Bases.  Quite a bit is being done to translate category theory into terminology 
more manageable for the non-mathematician, making Specware accessible to a 
wider audience.

Please note that the description here is mine only.  
I just want to share this because we have had quite a bit of 
success in our project, and it has put category theory on the map in our 
little corner of industry.  Our most direct application at present is for a 
separate project that is developing neutral representations for knowledge-
based engineering (KBE) systems, which are seeing increasing use.  Our 
specific example at present is the representation of engineering knowledge, 
and the refinement of it into code, for a program that produces a kind of 
airplane part design given its overall size and some sizing constraints. 
The program was synthesized by first developing a colimit of specifications 
of simple theories about part geometry, materials, manufacturing processes, 
and a representation of real numbers.  The specifications make visible 
the design and manufacturing rationale---the knowledge---that constitutes 
the constraints on the specific design.  Given sizing values, the layout 
for a specific design can be calculated.  The knowledge is re-usable because 
of its abstract nature, the use of diagrams and colimits in several 
categories to build complex specifications from simple components, and 
a way of implementing functorial program construction from specifications 
(or better yet, from diagrams).

A colleague and I have an initial attempt at a paper in a poster session 
at the upcoming Automated Software Engineering conference (ASE`97) this 
November.  We also have a paper to appear in the Journal of Intelligent 
Manufacturing and an associated technical report.  A good overall background 
is a paper by the original developers of the approach:

Jullig, R. and Srinivas, Y. V. (1993). Diagrams for Software Synthesis, 
in  Proceedings of KBSE `93: The Eighth Knowledge-Based Software Engineering 
Conference, IEEE Computer Society Press, pp. 10-19.
