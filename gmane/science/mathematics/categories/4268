Colin is exactly right on all points.

I tend to look at sets from the perspective neither of a set theorist
nor a category theorist but a combinatorialist.  As long as people agree
on the cardinalities of the homsets between sets, particularly the
finite ones, I figure they must be talking about essentially the same
objects.  Infinite domains are problematic for everyone, infinite
codomains much less so (we understand the homset N^2 much better than 2^N).

The remark in my post about the self-evident being merely a convenient
long-held hypothesis (which I put on my "sayings" website
http://boole.stanford.edu/dotsigs.html less than a month ago) applies in
spades to membership as characteristic of sets, the premise for ZF.
Those who identify acceptance of the category Set with acceptance of ZF
have not only not accepted but not even grasped that the wholesale
replacement of the binary relation of membership by the (partial) binary
operation of composition, with a set of axioms radically different from
those of ZF, is a foundational move.  ZF is so deeply ingrained in their
thought processes that they have no idea how to think about mathematical
structures without falling back on its axioms.  Borrowing from Hilbert,
they are unable to replace "set," "function," and "composite" by
"table," "chair," and "beermug."

If you find it hard to imagine how anyone could find it hard to imagine
mathematics without ZF, just read Steve Simpson on 2/25/98 (almost
exactly a decade ago) at

http://cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/1998-February/001228.html

The bit "I totally repudiate every syllable of every word of every
subclaim of every claim that McLarty has ever made about what he is
pleased to call `categorical foundations'" made abundantly clear back
then that Steve could not begin to concieve of replacing membership by
composition as the basis for an alternative foundation of mathematics.

While I can't speak for Steve today, this remains a stumbling block for
those raised to believe that rigorous mathematics would not be possible
in a world where propositions such as "for all x and y there exists z
such that x is a subset of z and y is a member of z" did not hold.  How
could  x U {y}  fail to exist and the walls of mathematics not come
tumbling down?
