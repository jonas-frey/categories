  *** PhD studies in Logic and Semantics at Bath ***

Applications are invited for PhD study in the Logic and Semantics of
Computation research group at the University of Bath.

Our staff include Alessio Guglielmi, Jim Laird, Guy McCusker and John
Power.
We welcome students interested in logic and proof theory, semantics of
programming languages and proof systems, and category theory.

The research publications of the Department of Computer Science at
Bath were ranked 3rd in the UK at the 2008 Research Assessment
Exercise. The department's other research interests include computer
algebra, computational geometry, logic programming, computer vision
and graphics, artificial intelligence, agents, and human-computer
interaction.

A wide range of funding opportunities, including full stipendiary
studentships as well as scholarships and fee-waivers, is available,
for studies commencing in October 2010. Every application will be
considered for all eligible funding sources. The sooner you apply, the
more opportunities are available.
