Hmm.  I suppose that restricting to subcategories which respect the group
structure on the Hom-sets would be enough to render the problem harder
(the group structure of course can be recovered canonically from the
underlying category, so this merely refines the class of subcategories we
are considering).  I would imagine this restriction would also have more
repercussions for algebra, anyway...
