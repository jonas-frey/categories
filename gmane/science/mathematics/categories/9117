Dear Fred,

A good answer, but my point was that it was a bad question.

You see this once you start pressing at the details. Are seals and turtles f=
ish? No, but on your definition it depends on whether flippers count as legs=
  or not. What about sea snakes? Obviously not - they're snakes, that just ha=
ppen to live in the sea. But then eels do seem a bit more fishy.

A meticulous zoologist would start piling on the subclauses to pin it down m=
ore precisely, but we know that that does not actually refine our understand=
ing of zoology. It just amplifies the misconceptions underlying the original=
  question.

I'm saying the same can happen in mathematics.

All the best,

Steve.
