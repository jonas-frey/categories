=3D=3D=3D Description =3D=3D=3D

Graphs are used as models in all areas of computer science: examples are
state space graphs, control flow graphs, syntax graphs, UML-type models
of all kinds, network layouts, social networks, dependency graphs, and
so forth. Once such graphical models are constructed, they can be
analysed and transformed to verify their correctness within a domain,
discover new properties, or produce new equivalent and/or optimised
versions.

Graphs as Models combines the strengths of two pre-existing workshop
series: GT-VMT (Graph Transformation and Visual Modelling Techniques)
and GRAPHITE (Graph Inspection and Traversal Engineering), but also
solicits research from other related areas, such as Social Network
Analysis.

Graphs as Models=E2=80=99 main focus is the exchange and collaboration of
researchers from different backgrounds. The workshop serves as platform
to boost inter- and transdisciplinary research and foster new ideas and
collaborations. Thus, besides classical research presentations, the
workshop is highly geared toward numerous interactive sessions.


=3D=3D=3D Topics =3D=3D=3D

This workshop seeks to attract and stimulate research on the techniques
for graph analysis, inspection and transformation, on an abstract level
rather than in any specific domain. Thus, the concept of a graph (in its
many guises) is central. Contributions should address scenarios for the
use of graphs in a modelling context that potentially transcend specific
settings and can be applied across domains. We welcome contributions on
any of the following (non-exhaustive) list of topics:

* The use of graph-based and graph-transformation-based models within
   various general approaches such as:
   - visual modelling languages (including aspects of meta modelling,
     grammars, and graphical parsing),
   - model-to-model and model-to-X transformations,
   - stochastic processes on graphs, and
   - compositional models (e.g. graphs-with-boundary, nominal graphs,
     string diagrams),
   and applications to concrete domains, including (but not restricted
   to):
   - software development (e.g., synthesis, planning, bug mitigation,
     repair & model driven development),
   - software analysis (e.g., verification, testing, static analysis,
     and simulation),
   - concurrency,
   - constraint based reasoning, and
   - social network analysis;

* Algorithms on graphs (with focus on scalability and efficiency),
   for example
   - graph search optimization (including search space reduction
     techniques),
   - analysis of large graphs and graph transformation systems,
   - graph matching, isomorphism checking, etc.,
   - graph properties that support efficient algorithms regarding
     quality properties (like real-time, safety, reliability, and
     energy consumption),
   - approaches exploiting concurrency/parallelism and dedicated
     hardware, and
   - simulation of models.

* The visualization of large graphs
   (including the simulation of transformation systems).

* New ways of applying graphs and graph transformation based
   techniques.

* Case studies and tools.


=3D=3D=3D Workshop Format =3D=3D=3D

This is a one-day-and-a-half day workshop programmed as a mixture of:

* Submitted paper presentations and

* Fully interactive sessions.


=3D=3D=3D Submissions =3D=3D=3D

The workshop seeks submissions of three kinds:

   1.) Full papers: We solicit papers of up to 15 pages, in the EPTCS
       LaTeX format, containing original results. Accepted papers will
       be published in EPTCS (Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical
       Computer Science).

   2.) Work-in-progress papers: We solicit papers of up to 15 pages, in
       the EPTCS LaTeX format, describing ongoing research. Accepted papers
       will be presented at the workshop and might be selected for publicati=
on
       in EPTCS.

   3.) Presentation abstracts: We solicit an abstract of 1-2 pages, in
       the EPTCS LaTeX format, describing ongoing research. Accepted
       abstracts will lead to a presentation at the workshop and will be
       included in the workshop's webpages.

   4.) Informal tool demo proposals: Tool demos limited to 10 minutes.
       Proposals will not be reviewed, unless selection turns out to be need=
ed.

All submissions have to adhere to the EPTCS format available at

       http://style.eptcs.org/

All contributions have to be submitted through EasyChair at:

       https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dgam2016

Details can be found on the workshop's webpage.
