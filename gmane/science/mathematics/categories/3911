This seems right for ordered fields.  Is it also true for finite fields
and other non-ordered fields like the complex numbers?

If every Archimedean field k gives rise to a Klem (Kleisli ~ EM) monad
Vct_k, that's uncountably many Klem monads right there, all in the
lattice of submonads of Vct_R.  (The submonads of a monad must form a
complete lattice, more precisely a complete semilattice, if they're
closed under arbitrary intersection; is it always an algebraic
semilattice, as for algebras?)

k doesn't even need to be a field or an additive group, any subrig of R
will do, as Bill was hinting at.  (The coefficients have to form a rig
for T to be functorial.)  Call this Method A for forming a submonad of
Vct_R.

Method B is to limit the operations to those whose weight (sum of
coefficients) is drawn from a submonoid of the monoid R under
multiplication.  (It has to be a submonoid for the multiplication mu and
unit eta to remain defined.)  The smallest such monoid is {1}, which
gave rise to the affine spaces as per my previous post.  R has plenty of
other multiplicative submonoids, such as the set {c^i} for any real c >
0 and i ranging over any submonoid of Z under addition, or for any real
c and i ranging over any submonoid of N under addition.  This can be
combined with Method A (coefficients from a subrig of R) to get even
more submonads.

Questions:

1.  Do all submonads of Vct_R arise as above (coefficients limited to a
subrig of R, weights limited to a multiplicative submonoid of R)?

2.  Among the submonads of Vct_R, are the Klem ones exactly those for
which the set of coefficients is dense in some open interval of R?

Point taken.  I was trying to say that identifying the two constants of
a free bipointed set was the canonical way of producing any nonfree
bipointed set.  What's a slicker way to say this?
