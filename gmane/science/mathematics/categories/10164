Dear  colleagues and friends,

I am writing to let you know that the School of Mathematics of the Universi=
ty of Leeds has just advertised a Lectureship in Pure Mathematics:

https://jobs.leeds.ac.uk/Vacancy.aspx?ref=3DEPSMA1014

The closing date is Sunday 26th April.=20

For those unfamiliar with UK academic system, a lectureship is a permanent =
position which involves both research and teaching. The job description men=
tions a preference for candidates in Analysis and Logic. Both are understoo=
d broadly, with Logic including also Category Theory.=20

If you wish to have more information, please feel to contact me.=20

With best regards,
Nicola Gambino
