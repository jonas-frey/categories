The Carnegie Mellon University Department of Philosophy invites
applications for the Herbert Simon Fellowship in Scientific
Philosophy. We are seeking applications from scholars working in logic
or philosophy of mathematics. Any of the following areas are
particularly welcome: proof theory, category theory, formal
verification, automated reasoning, or history or philosophy of
mathematics. The Fellowship is intended primarily for those who have
recently received doctorates, including scholars with a continuing
faculty appointment elsewhere. The Fellowship has a tenure of two
years (non-renewable), with teaching duties of 2 courses/year, one of
which should be a research seminar in the Fellow's specialty.
Appointments of one year are possible for applicants with a continuing
faculty appointment elsewhere. Residence in Pittsburgh is expected.
Applications (including a statement of purpose, CV, at least one
writing sample and two letters of reference) may be sent to: The
Philosophy Department; Carnegie Mellon University; Pittsburgh PA
15213. Attention: Simon Fellowship Committee. Electronic applications,
preferably in pdf format enclosed as attachments, are welcome and
indeed preferred. Send email to: phil-search@andrew.cmu.edu. The
deadline for application is December 1, 2010.
