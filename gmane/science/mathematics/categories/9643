Dear Steve,

very interesting question. I feel that the following remarks have some
relevance.

* Algebraic geometers do consider an analogue of the usual spectrum
   construction for topological rings: the "formal spectrum".
   Unfortunately, the theory is only developed for actual topological
   rings, not point-free versions of them.

* One can define a point-free notion of a spectrum for apartness rings
   (ring objects in the category of sets-equipped-with-apartness-relation).
   This secretly comes up in algebraic geometry: Let X be a scheme.
   Inside the topos Sh(X), there is the ring O_X to which we can apply the
   usual point-free spectrum construction. We might hope that this just
   yields the one-point space; but unless X was zero-dimensional to begin
   with, this hope is false. In fact, the externalization of this
   construction is a locally ringed locale which comes equpped with a morphism
   of ringed locales to (X,O_X); but this morphism is not a morphism of
   *locally* ringed locales.

   The solution to this problem is to observe that O_X, being a local
   ring, has canonically the structure of an apartness ring. The variant
   of the spectrum construction for apartness rings applied to it yields
   the one-point space (i.e. (X,O_X) itself from the external point of
   view), as one would expect.

* Both the problem and the solution can be generalized a bit.

   Let X be a scheme. Let A be an O_X-algebra. Then algebraic geometers
   consider the "relative spectrum of A", which is always a locally
   ringed locale over X and will be a scheme if A is quasicoherent.
   As before, it's not true that one can obtain the relative spectrum
   simply by carrying out the usual point-free spectrum construction
   internally in Sh(X). A variant is needed.

A description of these variants of the usual construction can be found in Section 12
of https://rawgit.com/iblech/internal-methods/master/notes.pdf. However,
I don't know yet a natural generalization of these constructions which
could be directly helpful to your project -- they are tailored to
apartness rings and to algebras over local rings. While it's certainly
better to view the reals as an apartness ring instead of an ordinary ring,
information has still been lost from the point-free version of the
reals.

Cheers,
Ingo
