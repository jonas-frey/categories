Dear Jim

I don't see the big deal about not having a unit in the monoid when looking
at (pseudo-)actions; throw one in - we know how it should act.  If you
agree to this then what you are looking at is a pseudofunctor (or
homomorphism of bicategories)  R : M --> Cat  where  M  is the monoid
regarded as a one-object category.  Indeed,  M  can be any category.  There
is an equivalence between the 2-category  Hom(M,Cat)  of homomorphisms from
M  to Cat  and the 2-category  Fib/M  of opfibrations over  M.

The study of fibrations has gone off in many directions: for example, it
provides the appropriate way of dealing with categories of all sizes (not
just small) when working in a topos.

As to higher homotopies, Cat doesn't really have enough dimensions for
them. But there are trihomomorphisms  M --> Bicat.  More generally, there
will be higher homomorphisms  M --> WOC  where  WOC  is the weak
omega-category of weak omega-categories - someday  - for now we have
several fairly good definitions of the objects and arrows of  WOC  but
that's as far as it goes.  Higher fibrations is another interesting topic:
Claudio Hermida knows about the 2-category case which is relevant to braids
since 2-opfibrations over a 2-category  M  correspond to homomorphisms  M
--> 2-Cat  where  2-Cat  is self-enriched via the internal hom for the Gray
tensor product of 2-categories (and it is in proving the coherence for this
tensor product where braid groups first seriously entered category theory).

Also, consider any braided monoidal bicategory  B  and let  t  be the n-th
tensor power of some object of  B.  Then there is an action of the kind you
describe of the n-string braid group on the hom-category  B(t,t).  But this
is part of a longer story.
