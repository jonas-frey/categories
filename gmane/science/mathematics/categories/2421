 What you are looking for may be similar to something I queried Ross Street in regard to earlier this summer.
 I'll save him some time by putting here the relevant part of his response.

 I recommend the work of McCrudden, who has developed among other things a
 descent theoretic approach to the tensor product of V-actegories.
 There is also resource in the work of Harald Lindner.
 His paper, Enriched Categories and Enriched Modules, in Cahiers, Vol XXII-2 (1981)
 develops morphisms between enriched categories and actegories, which he calls modules.
 I'm curious about why it is that I have never seen his work referenced.
