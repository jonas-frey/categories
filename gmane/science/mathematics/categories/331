From: James Stasheff <jds@math.unc.edu>

this seems to ignore the distinction between neighbors (aka comrades)
and parts (elements)
The group of rational integers, with its non-identity automrophisms
can, i thought, be distinguished from  the Thom space of the
> tangent bundle of some exotic manifold with its non-identity automrophisms
without comparison to other sets of `numbers' or less exotic manifolds
