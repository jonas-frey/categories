Dear Steve,

I can understand you don't like my question. Some of the answers I =20
received prove that other mathematicians I respect approve of it, have =20=

thought about, and have given partial answers to it.
If you have any objections, take a stand and give MATHEMATICAL reasons =20=

for your objections.

All you say is;
> I'm saying the same can happen in mathematics.
Prove that it DID happen in my question!

By the way, I'm no zoologist but, by fishing through your mails, I =20
found a big gap in your refutation. Neither in your mails nor in =20
Fred's did I find any reference to the octopus. If there is any good =20
reason  for this omission, mathematical OR zoological, please make it =20=

public and justify it.

All the best,

Jean
