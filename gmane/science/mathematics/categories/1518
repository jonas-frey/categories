I think this is obvious from the fact that the theory of presheaves over C
is many sorted, essentially algebraic (a finite limit theory), with a sort
for each object of C and a unary operator for each morphism. Then finitely
presentable in the categorical sense is the same as finitely presentable in
the algebraic sense, which is equivalent to being a finite colimit of free
cyclic (i.e. one generator) algebras. In the case of presheaves, Yoneda's
lemma says precisely that the free algebra on a generator of sort X (object
of C) is the representable presheaf for X.

I have exploited some of these facts in a paper with my PhD student Gillian
Hill, "Presheaves as configured specifications". It develops a language for
specifying systems by components with sharing.
