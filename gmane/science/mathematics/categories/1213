                          CALL FOR PAPERS

                Submission Deadline: November 15, 1999


OBJECTIVES OF THE WORKSHOP 
--------------------------
Graphical representations and graphs are extremely useful to model 
complex structures in many fields of computer science. 
Graph transformation is the rule-based manipulation of such graphs.
The final workshop of APPLIGRAPH and GETGRATS intends to bring together 
leading researchers in theory and application of graph transformation 
and researchers in other areas of ETAPS who are interested in graph 
transformation. For this reason, this workshop is not restricted to
members of the teams of APPLIGRAPH and GETGRATS, but open for anybody. 
The contributions during the workshop will be based on extended
abstracts selected by an international program committee.
After the workshop two special issues of journals will be published 
focusing on selected contributions of the workshop.

MAIN TOPICS 
-----------
Major topics of interest include but are not limited to the following: 

Fundamentals:   Node, edge and hyperedge replacement,   
                algebraic and logical approaches, 
                term graph rewriting, 
                graph theoretical properties,
                concurrency, distributivity and semantics, 
                high-level replacement systems, 
                structuring concepts, 
                analysis techniques for graphs and graph transformation.

Applications:   languages and tools based on graph transformation, 
                application of graph transformation to 
                        visual languages, 
                        database and information systems, 
                        concurrent and distributed systems, 
                        CSCW,
                        distributed business process reengineering, 
                        design/implementation of programming languages, 
                        software engineering. 

FORM AND SIZE OF CONTRIBUTIONS 
------------------------------
Submitted extended abstracts of about 8 LNCS pages should report 
recent and ongoing research work. 
Electronic submission to gratra2000@tfs.cs.tu-berlin.de is strongly
recommended.  
We would like to encourage people to submit full papers to the main
conferences of ETAPS 2000 and allow to have extended abstracts of the
the same subject as submission for GRATRA 2000, in parallel. If both are
accepted, the lecture will be held at the ETAPS conference, but also
announced during GRATRA 2000. 
         
IMPORTANT DATES 
---------------
November 15, 1999       -   Deadline for Submission of Extended
Abstracts 
January 20, 2000        -   Notification of Acceptance/ Rejection 
February 20, 2000       -   Final Version of Extended Abstract

ORGANIZERS 
----------     
The area of graph transformation is supported by the TMR Research
Network GETGRATS (General Theory of Graph Transformation Systems) 
where the emphasis is on  theoretical aspects and on training 
of young researchers. It is further supported by the ESPRIT 
Working Group APPLIGRAPH (Applications of Graph Transformation). 
This workshop is a joint workshop  of APPLIGRAPH and GETGRATS. 
It is organized as satellite event of the conference ETAPS 2000 
(European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software)
at the Technische Universität Berlin.  
The workshop is organized by H. Ehrig and G. Taentzer (local organizers) 
in cooperation with A. Corradini (GETGRATS coordinator) and 
H.-J. Kreowski  (APPLIGRAPH coordinator).
