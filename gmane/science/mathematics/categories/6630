      Sixth International Workshop on Logical Frameworks
            and Meta-Languages: Theory and Practice
                   (LFMTP'11)

               http://lfmtp11.cs.umn.edu

          Nijmegen, The Netherlands, August 27, 2011
     Affiliated with Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP 2011)

                CALL FOR PAPERS

     -------------------------------------------------------------
                IMPORTANT DATES

         Abstract submission:     May 16, 2011
         Paper submission:        May 23, 2011
         Author notification:     June 22, 2011
              Final versions due:      August 1, 2011
             Workshop day:            August 27, 2011
     -------------------------------------------------------------

Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for
representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of
deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their
design and implementation on the one hand and their use in reasoning
tasks ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of
formal computational systems on the other hand have been the focus of
considerable research over the last two decades. This workshop will
bring together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss
various aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical
frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and
co-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressivity and lucidity of
the reasoning process.

The broad subject areas of LFMTP'11 are:

  * Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming
    languages and related formally specified systems.
  * Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of
    variable binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning
    about, datatypes defined from binding signatures.
  * Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and
    associated reasoning techniques.
  * Case studies of meta-programming, and the mechanization of the
    (meta)theory of descriptions of programming languages and other
    calculi. Papers focusing on logic translations and on experiences
    with encoding programming languages theory are particularly
    welcome.

Topics include, but are not limited to

     * logical framework design
     * meta-theoretic analysis
     * applications and comparative studies
     * implementation techniques
     * efficient proof representation and validation
     * proof-generating decision procedures and theorem provers
     * proof-carrying code
     * substructural frameworks
     * semantic foundations
     * methods for reasoning about logics
     * formal digital libraries

Program Committee:

Claudio Sacerdoti Coen    (University of Bologna)
Herman Geuvers             (Radboud University Nijmegen)
James McKinna              (Radboud University Nijmegen)
Gopalan Nadathur           (University of Minnesota)
Frank Pfenning               (Carnegie Mellon University)
Alwen Tiu                       (Australian National University)
Christian Urban               (TU Munich)

Submission of papers is electronic and must be completed through the
EasyChair server that can be accessed through the workshop web
site. The actual paper submission must be preceded by the submission
of a title and a short abstract---see the important dates indicated
alongside.  Submissions to the workshop can take several forms, such
as system descriptions, short accounts of work in progress, and
detailed, technical presentations of new results. Different categories
of submissions will be judged differently, the main common criteria
being the content of the ideas and their ability to stimulate
discussions at the workshop. Submissions must be in PDF format
prepared in LaTeX using the EPTCS macro package
(http://style.eptcs.org) and must not exceed 15 pages including
references.

Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop by their
authors. Revised versions of these papers will be included in the
proceedings that will be published as an Electronic Proceedings in
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) via http://eptcs.org.
