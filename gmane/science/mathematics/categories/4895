More precisely, AFAIK, copyright effectively applies to the *form* that you
used to describe Pythagora's theorem. As such, no one is allowed to reprodu=
ce
it with the same exact form as you long as the copyright holder doesn't gra=
nt
him or her that exclusive right.

Let us however recall that patenting algorithms is possible in the USA or in
Japan but certainly not in the EU, until now (despite much repeated lobbying
from pharmaceutical and IT companies). Still, the European Patent Office
(EPO) has already accepted tens of thousands of such patents, by cheating
with the law (indeed, the law says that you can't patent an algorithm "as
such", which the EPO interpreted as : you can patent an algorithm as long as
it is part of a "technical mechanism" such as an MP3 player, for instance).

Without even entering into social or economic outcome of "openness" of
results, or so-called innovations (see Maskin's publications for more
information, for instance), I'd like to point out an ethical issue here. Th=
at
is the harm done to a 500-year, or so, social contract between scientists
acknowledging publicly, that is in publications, that they stand on the
shoulders of giants or, with less grandiosity, on other colleagues' results=
.=20

Of course, there is a strong incentive, to say the least, in many instituti=
ons
for the "valorisation" of results. My point is that a strong "openness" (su=
ch
as publications under "creative commons" or release of software under
free/open-source licences) may give a far better valorisation of results th=
an
strong, defensive, appropriation, while being more compliant to centuries of
scientific practice.=20


Best regards,
