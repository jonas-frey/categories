I may have missed some parts of the equality message exchange, but here=20
a few lines from general equational programming point of view.

I believe it is always important to note where equality or its genetic=20
siblings reside. As far as I understand we do category theory mostly over=
=20
ZFC, so ZFC is a metalanguage for category theory. The equality for "the=20
diagram commutes" is in ZFC, but the "equation" t1 =3D t2 involving two=20
terms over a signature is more tricky. You might say it's an ordered pair=
=20
(t1,t2), and that structure is in ZFC. The objective of rewriting is to=20
find a substitution (Kleisli morphism) s so that s(t1)=3Ds(t2). More=20
precisely, the substitution is a morphism s : X -> TY, so you extend it t=
o
Ts : TX -> TTY, and bring it to mu_Y o Ts : TX -> TY with the mu from the=
=20
term monad. All this is done over Set, i.e. T is a monad over Set, and=20
therefore TX and TY are sets in ZFC. So, the equality in mu o Ts(t1) =3D =
mu=20
o Ts(t2) is the equality in ZFC. Incidently, Set is already here in=20
question as Set covers only the one-sorted signatures case. Moving over t=
o=20
many-sorted signatures you need more.

However, you can use composed monads instead of T, and you don't have to=20
be over Set, or its multisorted cousin. Even more so, is it really only=20
about ordered pairs? In the end, we are looking for a substitution=20
bringing that "possibly something else than just an ordered pair" to=20
something close to a 'singleton', where the notion of 'singleton' then=20
should reside mostly in the purely categorical language, rather than in=20
only and exclusively in ZFC.

General logics (Meseguer, Goguen, Burstall et al) in a general monadic=20
setting both for terms as well as sentences, invites to this thinking,=20
even if admittedly the programing examples at this point, for the monadic=
=20
extensions, are rather artificial.

Also note that syntactics has for quite a while been studied with respect=
=20
to categorization, but semantics is mostly seen in the metalanguage of se=
t=20
theory. Doesn't have to be so? Cannot be so? We are obviously trying to=20
complicate things as much as possible in syntactics, and when it comes to=
=20
semantics, our semantics domains are mostly sets, and equality is like=20
the emperor, changing clothes all the time.

Best regards,

Patrik
