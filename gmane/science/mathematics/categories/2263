2nd Call for Papers: [ Apologies for multiple copies ]

                Workshop on

           CATEGORICAL METHODS
                   FOR
 CONCURRENCY, INTERACTION, AND MOBILITY

  Marseille, France, 6 September, 2003

affiliated with CONCUR 2003 and held together with GETCO 2003

(See also: http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk/events/cmcim03)

Aims and Scope:

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers applying
category theory to concurrency, interaction, or mobility. Topics of
interest include, but are not limited to:

  categorical algebras of processes
  categorical methods in game semantics and geometry of interaction
  categorical models of term/graph rewriting or rewriting logic
  Chu spaces
  coalgebras, bialgebras, coinduction
  comparing models of concurrency
  enriched categories of processes
  interaction categories
  presheaf models


GETCO'03:

Due to the close relation between geometric and topological methods on
the one hand and categorical methods on the other hand, CMCIM'03 will
be held jointly with the workshop on Geometric and Toplogical Methods
in Concurrency Theory (GETCO'03). Both workshops will be on the same
day with their talks not overlapping.


Invited Lecture:

 Glynn Winskel
