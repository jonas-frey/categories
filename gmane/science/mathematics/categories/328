Any philosophy category theory may have would have at its core, I think,
the notion that mathematical objects are known *not* in isolation but
in the context of their comrades.  The group of rational integers,
accompanied *only* by its identity map, and the Thom space of the
tangent bundle of some exotic manifold, accompanied once again *only*
by its identity map, are, as categories, indistinguishable.

Plucked out of their original contexts, there is no longer any social setting
where one can find any difference between them that really *makes* a
difference.

According to some other views of mathematics, the group of rational integers,
that particular Thom space, the real number {pi}, and my current left shoe,
all have unique mathematical personalities that let them be "obviously"
distinguished one from another, without any reference even to what I would
call their "natural ambient environments".

>From my perspective, admittedly that of a categorist, these views result
from a simple failure to recognize that what passes for the "intrinsic
structure" of a mathematical object is in fact nothing more (nor less)
than a clear understanding of its relations with its mates, of roughly
similar character, in some category (that "went without saying") they all
jointly inhabit -- even the phrase "roughly similar character" is justifiable
*only* by virtue of the fact that they *do* all inhabit some same category.

I hope I'm actually making myself clear, and not just preaching to the converted.
