I was very happy and relieved when reading Fred Linton's message =
underneath
and then Bill's agreement, since, after reading Ross Street's message =
about the
use of the term "chaotic" by Bourbaki and French culture, I had started
getting serious doubts about the state of my own memory.
Indeed everybody can check that, from Bourbaki's first edition of =
Topology to the final
one  (seriously reshaped by Grothendieck, I think), published in 1971 =
and
74, though the indiscrete topology is the first example given for a
topology, followed by the discrete one, it is (rather curiously) not =
given a
name.
However, at least from the fifties, and certainly before, the French
terminology "topologie grossie`re" was universally accepted and used as =
the
unique one by the whole community of French mathematicians, at all =
levels, from education
to research. I am not aware that things have changed, though it is =
nowadays
difficult to find a text written in French by a young French native =
speaker
which would not be a poor translation from Frenglish of a poor =
translation
from French to Frenglish (a consequence of the fact that French language =
is no
longer taught at French schools, an open secret ; well, you understand =
that I am not a
candidate to the Ministry of Education).
  Of course (!) the use of the English term "coarse", which is perhaps =
the
translation in down-to-earth language of the French "grossier" was much =
less successful, and probably
used essentially in texts which were more or less translated from French =
or deriving from French culture. It
seems to be more or less abandonned nowadays and to have got some very =
special quite different and technical meaning (in=20
connection with the study of Gromov metrics).
It seems also that the English-speaking classical topologists are =
nowadays generally pleased with the neologism/pun pair offered by in(or =
un-)discrete/indiscreet, which cannot have any French equivalent, for =
orthographic reasons (just one possible orthograph and meaning for =
"indiscret").

As to the term "chaotic", I have exactly the same (absence of) =
experience as
Fred (perhaps it was used by Grothendieck's school in the sixties, but I =
am
not familiar with that, and don't remember to have heard of it) and =
think it
is evoking unavoidably the field of dynamical systems (where however it =
is
probably used without a very precise and unique definition). I'm sure =
I'll
never use such a term for naming the very simple notion which is called =
"pair
groupoid" in the book by Kirill on Lie groupoids ; this latter =
terminology (which
however I don't like very much, see further) is presently accepted by =
many authors,
and I'm surprised that none of them came to the fore in that discussion.
It should be noted however that the geometer van Est sometimes used the =
term "blackhole" for naming the space of leaves of a foliation when its =
topology (in the elementary sense, i.e. the quotient one) is the =
indiscrete one; I suppose this was evocating the very chaotic behaviour =
of the leaves in such a case.

However all the preceding (purely linguistic) considerations are very =
secondary in my opinion
and I turn now in more details to my main point which was expressed in =
my previous message but found no echo.
First of all I claim that I perfectly agree with Peter May about the =
basic importance of what I prefer to call banal groupoids (in some =
internal contexts I am currently using, they don't always exist, an a =
quest for suitable substitutes may be an important motivation). But I =
don't think this justifies to look for terrific names, which anyway can =
reflect but a tiny part of these important properties.=20
The term "banal" should not be regarded as pejorative. Think to =
mathematical objects like 0, 1, 2: they are probably among the most =
banal, or even silly, objects from a na=EFve point of view, though they =
are bearing a lot of very rich but highly degenerate structures, and =
they are perhaps encapsulating some basic processes for explaining the =
transition from nothingless to being (!); this would not be a reason for =
trying to give them mysterious names borrowed from philosophy or =
theology (!).

More precisely the adjunction property which is intended to be stressed =
by introducing duets such as discrete/co-discrete, is just a part of an =
iceberg of some interesting adjunction strings (with different lengths) =
arising from various forgetful functors.
But the structure of these strings are strongly depending on the =
"structure" you are forgetting and are quite different when dealing with =
the algebraic structure of groupoid or with a topological structure; in =
the latter case you may get the pi_0 functor (connected components) as =
arising in that way in such a string.
Now when dealing with topological (and particularly smooth) groupoids =
(internal groupoids in the category Top or Dif), subtle interesting =
interactions and clashes arise between the two strings: in a certain =
sense it may be said than a suitable pi_1 functor emerges as a certain =
kind of internal pi_0, in a way that includes notably the correct pi_1 =
concept (Poincare' functor) for spaces of leaves of a foliation; the =
latter was introduced by different geometers by means of various ad hoc =
constructions (Haefliger, van Est, Paul ver Ecke); it turns out that =
these constructions may be derived from a general algebraic construction =
described in the book by Gabriel-Zisman, which introduces an adjoint for =
the "nerve functor" from groupoids to simplicial sets. This approach =
yields immediately a van Kampen theorem by preservation of colimits, =
according to Ronnie's presentation.
This whole stuff was described in a CRAS Note (Paris) which I published =
in 1989 (cosigned with my irakian student Alta'ai) (t. 309, Se'rie I, p. =
503-506). Unhappily neither Haefliger nor van Est understood a single =
word of this Note (which indeed they tried to get rejected, =
unsuccessfully), since they are not at all categorically minded. The =
main result was formulated in a different way, using what I called =
simplified calculus of fractions for Morita equivalences (which cannot =
be derived as a special case from the classical Gabriel-Zisman calculus =
of fractions) in a paper published in les Cahiers de Topologie in the =
same year, nowadays available with minor corrections and important added =
comments in arXiv:0803.4209v1. In fact my secret hope is that such a =
construction (from pi_0 to pi_1) might be a first step for an inductive =
process leading to higher homotopy in the spirit of Ronnie and Higgins.

Clearly the use of the same word "discrete", originated from =
(elementary) Topology to describe adjointness properties which are quite =
different for groupoids and for topological spaces, but are able to lead =
to fundamental interactions when studied for topological groupoids, make =
it strictly impossible to perform that type of studies, which I regard =
as very fecund. More generally further comments about the widespread =
misuse of topological terminology in the purely algebraic framework of =
abstract groupoids may be found in  arXiv:0711.1608v1, a paper written =
on the occasion of Ehresmann's birthday 100th anniversary.=20

Bill recalls:

> were alternate terminology for a certain kind of space.

My memory rather matches instead what I see in (3.2(d)) of Willard,
that the topology with only the whole space and the empty set "open"
is called either 'trivial' or 'indiscrete'.

In my experience I've never encountered 'chaotic' as the
adjective used for that attribute -- indeed, 'chaotic' would have
conflicted rather badly with the Chaos Theory arising out of Ren=E9
Thom's Catastrophe Theory of the early '60s or so -- and 'codiscrete'
strikes me as what only a categorist hoping (as we many of us
long did) to systematize terminology into dual camps of 'properties'
and 'coproperties' (in the model of adjoint/coadjoint, limit/colimit,
terminal/coterminal, etc.) could have come up with -- not a term any
self-respecting point-set topologist would have thought to use :-) .

'Codiscrete' of course does, for just that reason, have its merits,
as Bill points out:

And I object not one whit to any of that :-) .

This again suggests that 'chaotic' might not be the best choice of
adjective for that indiscrete/codiscrete topology, or the analogous
type of category, or groupoid, or topological category or groupoid.
