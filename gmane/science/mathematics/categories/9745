******************************************************************

-- ABOUT ETAPS --

ETAPS is the primary European forum for academic and industrial
researchers working on topics relating to software science. ETAPS,
established in 1998, is a confederation of five main annual
conferences, accompanied by satellite workshops. ETAPS 2019 is the
twenty-second event in the series.


-- MAIN CONFERENCES (8-11 April) --

    * ESOP: European Symposium on Programming
        (PC chair Lu=C3=ADs Caires, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal)
    * FASE: Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering
        (PC chairs Reiner H=C3=A4hnle, Technische Univ Darmstadt, Germany,
        and Wil van der Aalst, RWTH Aachen University, Germany)
    * FoSSaCS: Foundations of Software Science
        and Computation Structures
        (PC chairs Mikolaj Bojanczyk, University of Warsaw, Poland,

-- SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS --

ETAPS conferences solicit contributions of two types: research papers
and tool demonstration papers. ESOP and FoSSaCS accept only research
papers. FASE, POST and TACAS have multiple types of research papers,
see below.

All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings and have
presentations during the conference.

A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one
of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation.

Submitted papers must be in English presenting original research. They
must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere (this
does not apply to abstracts). In particular, simultaneous submission
of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is
forbidden.=20

Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer's
Lecture Notes in Computer Science and be submitted electronically in
pdf through the EasyChair author interface of the respective
conference.

Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be
rejected immediately.

FASE and POST use double-blind review.

Like ETAPS 2018, the proceedings of ETAPS 2019 will be published in
*gold open access*. The copyright of the papers will remain with the
authors. The proceedings will be published in the Advanced Research in
Computing and Software Science (ARCoSS) subline of Springer's Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series.

The publisher's charges for gold open access will be paid by the
conference (funded with the participation fees of all
participants). There will be no added cost for authors specifically.


- Research papers

FASE, FoSSaCS and TACAS have a page limit of 15 pp (excluding
bibliography) for research papers, whereas POST allows at most 20 pp
(excluding bibliography) and ESOP 25 pp (excluding bibliography).

Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication
in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed
in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page
limit. ETAPS referees are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers
must be understandable without them.

In addition to regular research papers, TACAS solicits also *case
study papers* (with the same page limit as for regular research
papers). POST solicits also *systematization of knowledge papers*
(with the same page limit as for regular research papers) and
*position papers* (max 10 pp, excluding bibliography).

Both TACAS and FASE solicit also *regular tool papers* (at most 15 pp,
excluding bibliography).


- Tool demonstration papers

Tool demo papers have a page limit of 6 pp. The individual conferences
FASE, POST, TACAS have additional specific requirements on tool demo
papers.

ESOP and FoSSaCS do not consider tool demonstration papers.


-- SATELLITE EVENTS (6-7 April) --

A number of satellite workshops will take place before the main
conferences: BEHAPI, CREST, DICE-FOPARA, GaLoP, HCVS, HSB, InterAVT,
LiVe, MeTRiD, PERR, PLACES, QAPL, SPIoT, SynCoP, VerifyThis.


-- HOST INSTITUTION --

ETAPS 2019 is hosted by the School of Computer Science of the Charles
University in Prague, the beautiful capital of the Czech Republic.


-- ORGANIZERS

Jan Kofron and Jan Vitek (general chairs), Barbora Buhnova, Milan
Ceska, Ryan Culpepper, Vojtech Horky, Paley Li, Petr Maj, Artem
