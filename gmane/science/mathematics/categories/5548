This notice was forwarded by Graduate Studies at Dalhousie. As you will
see, it is not specific to either Dalhousie or Mathematics and it is
restricted to citizens of the countries listed below in 1. Probably a
long shot but if one category theorist scores, it's worth a posting.
Best, R_j

Subject: Government of Canada Post-Doctoral Research Fellowships

To Department Chairs and Graduate Coordinators:

A competition has recently been announced for the Government of Canada
Post-Doctoral Research Fellowships (PDRFs).  The PDRFs provide opportunities for
foreign researchers to study at Canadian universities for a one-year period.  I
would therefore be grateful if you would please forward this notice to any
faculty member who may find it to be of interest.

The PDRFs are based on reciprocal agreements between Canada and foreign
governments, and are designed to provide research opportunities to promising,
recent, non-Canadian doctoral graduates.  Awards are tenable at recognized
public Canadian universities and affiliated research institutes. PDRFs are
offered in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering.
Fellowships are not offered to professional artists, nor to those wishing to do
clinical research and training involving patient care.

The total value of the fellowship is CAN $32,000 and it is not taxable in
Canada.  It is valid for 12 months and is not renewable.

Applicants must:

1. Be citizens of one of the following countries: Brazil, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Russia, or Switzerland. Applicants who have
obtained Canadian citizenship or applied for permanent residency in Canada are
not eligible for an award.

2. Have completed a Ph.D. degree within the last 4 years or have completed the
Ph.D. degree requirements before the beginning of the award.

3. Be accepted into a post-doctoral position at a recognized public Canadian
university or affiliated research institute of their choice.

Full information about the PDRFs, and application procedures, are available via
the following website:
http://www.scholarships.gc.ca/PDRFNonCdn-BRPDEtr-Eng.aspx

Note that the deadline for applications varies, depending on the nationality of
the applicant.  Any faculty member who is interested in bringing a foreign
researcher to Dalhousie under this scheme is invited to contact me as soon as
possible, for more information and support in preparing applications.

For more information, you may also wish to contact Jennifer Morawiecki,
International Research Facilitator, International Research & Development,
Dalhousie Research Services at jennifer.morawiecki@dal.ca or 494-1734.
