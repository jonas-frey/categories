Dear all,

Recently we have noticed that there is an error in the paper "Traced
Monoidal Categories" by Joyal, Street and Verity, published in 1996.
It is about the bidjointness of the Int-construction and, to our best
knowledge, never pointed out before. We think that it is of some
interest for quite a few people, as this biadjointness is widely known
and frequently quoted in the literature, especially in various work in
theoretical computer science.

In the paper by JSV, it is claimed that (in Proposition 5.2) the
Int-construction gives a left biadjoint of the inclusion of the
2-category TortMon (of tortile monoidal categories, balanced monoidal
functors and monoidal natural transformations) in the 2-category
TraMon (of traced monoidal categories, traced strong monoidal functors
and monoidal natural transformations). However, we found that the
statement is not quite correct. There is a simple counterexample:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counterexample:
Let N=(N,0,+,\leq) be the traced partially ordered set of natural
numbers. Then Int(N) is equivalent to the compact closed partially
ordered set Z=(Z,0,+,-,\leq) of integers. The biadjointness would say
that TraMon(N,Z) is equivalent to TortMon(Int(N),Z), which in turn is
equivalent to TortMon(Z,Z).
However, some calculation shows that TraMon(N,Z) is isomorphic to the
partially ordered set of natural numbers, while TortMon(Z,Z) is
isomorphic to a discrete category with countably many objects.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

JSV's proof was almost perfect, except the very last three lines where
some details on 2-cells were missing/wrong.

We think that the easiest (and possibly the only) way to recover the
biadjointness is to modify the definition of TraMon as the 2-category
of traced monoidal categories, traced strong monoidal functors and
*invertible* monoidal natural transformations - this is a natural
choice, as the 2-cells of TortMon are invertible because of the
presence of duals - then all seem to work well (and Ross agreed in his
reply to our message).

In practice, as far as we can see, this seems to be a relatively
harmless error, as most uses of the Int-construction in the literature
do not depend on the details on 2-cells (they often do not mention
2-cells at all). However, there are some papers explicitly mentioning
2-cells and thus inheriting the incorrect statement from the JSV
paper. (Unfortunately, it is the case for a paper by one [Hasegawa] of
us ...)
