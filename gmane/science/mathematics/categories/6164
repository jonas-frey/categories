An obvious reason not to do this is that "wrong" can also mean
"incorrect" in English, and plenty of definitions are evil but correct.

[It's probably irrelevant, but the term "evil" is well-established among
programmers in a broadly similar sense: "evil does not imply incompetence
or bad design, but rather a set of goals or design criteria fatally
incompatible with the speaker's". See
http://catb.org/jargon/html/E/evil.html .]
