Call For Papers

Workshop on Logics for Resources, Processes and Programs
(LRPP 2013)

16 September 2013, Nancy, France

(affiliated with Tableaux 2013, Nancy, France)

http://www.loria.fr/~galmiche/LRPP2013.html

Deadline: June 24, 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A one day workshop on `Logics for Resources, Processes, and Programs'
will be held the 16th September 2013 in conjunction with the Tableaux
Conference in Nancy, France, with D. Galmiche and D. Pym as co-chairs.

The purpose of this workshop would be to discuss recent results on
logics, including systems formulated in the style of Hoare and
Hennessy-Milner, for modelling resources, processes, programs, and
their interactions. We envisage a range of perspectives:
proof-theoretic foundations, including decidability and complexity;
semantic foundations (e.g., new resource semantics); specification of
properties and behaviours; verification and analysis of programs and
systems. It should help to establish and publicize a research agenda
for such logics and their use in the development of trusted
systems.

The workshop is intended to provide a forum for discussion between
researchers interested in logics of resources (from foundations to
related calculi and applications) and researchers interested in
languages and methods for specification of mobile, distributed,
concurrent systems and their verification.


Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to,
the following:

- Logics for resources: semantics, model theory and proof theory;
- Process calculi, concurrency, and resource-distribution;
- Reasoning about programs and systems;
- Extensions of logics; e.g., with modalities;
- Languages of assertions, languages based on resource logics (query
   languages, pointers, trees, and graphs);
- Theorem proving and model checking in resource logics:
   decision procedures, strategies, complexity results.

INVITED SPEAKER

Edmund Robinson, QMUL


SUBMISSIONS

Researchers interested in presenting their works are invited to send an
extended abstract (up to 10 pages) by e-mail submissions of PDF files
to D. Galmiche (Didier.Galmiche@loria.fr) and D. Pym
(d.j.pym@abdn.ac.uk) by June 24, 2013.

Papers will be reviewed by peers, typically members of
the Programme Committee.

Additional information will be available through WWW address:
http://www.loria.fr/~galmiche/LRPP2013.html.

Hardcopies of the preliminary proceedings will be distributed at the
workshop and a Special Issue of a Journal on these topics is expected
after the workshop.
