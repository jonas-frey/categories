The NASSLLI Steering Committee is pleased to announce the Second North
American Summer School in Logic, Language and Information, to be held
in Bloomington, Indiana, June 17-21, 2003.  The event follows on from
the successful first school at Stanford in June, 2002. The school is
focussed on the interfaces among linguistics, logic, and computation,
broadly conceived, and on related fields.  Our sister school, the
European Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information, has been
highly successful, becoming an important meeting place and forum for
discussion for students and researchers interested in the
interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information.  We hope
that the North American schools will follow in this tradition.



                                   PROGRAM
