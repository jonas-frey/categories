Well, I am speculating here.  But FWIW, here goes.  Back in prehistory,
there were covariant and contravariant tensors.  Later on, came homology,
a word with impeccable credentials.  The dual was called cohomology, the
co- doubltess a shortening of contra-.  Very bad choice.  But that's the
way it came.  Peter Hilton pointed out that "homology" should be generic
with cohomology as the covariant version and contrahomology as the
contravariant one.  I think he wrote a book using "homology" and
"contrahomology", a kind of intermediate step.  Good idea, but hopeless,
really.  It reminds me of my pet peeve, which is the use of the horseshoe
for included-in-or-equal.  Thus destroying the analogy with <, as well as
requiring the idiotic horseshoe-plus-not-equal, which does not even appear
in the standard fonts.  So I never use the plain horseshoe for anything.
If everybody did that, then after one generation mathematicians could
start using the horseshoe for proper inclusion.  It will never happen.

As for which is which, that is a harder question.  If D is a diagram,
cone(-,D) is contravariant, but a representing object is called a limit of
D. But limit is covariant in D.  The opposite is true of cocones and
colimits.  Which one is right?  Hard to say?  I call a reflective
subcategory one whose inclusion has a left adjoint, but that has been
called coreflective (although probably not in recent years).  The co- in
cofinal has nothing to do (except perhaps very indirectly) with the one in
colimit.  I think it is like the co- in coordinate.  As such, I see
nothing wrong with final.  Or rather, I don't see that cofinal is any
improvement.  A family of objects in a category is weakly final (or weakly
terminal) if every object in the category has at least one arrow to at
least one object of said family.  Replace both "at least"s by "exactly"
and you have a final (or terminal) family and require the family to be
singleton and you have a final (or terminal) object.  So final ought to be
weakly final and similarly for cofinal, but I don't expect anyone's usage
will change.
