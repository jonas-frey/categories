The following paper has been published:

M. Grandis, Distributive lattices and coherence in homological algebra,
Asia Pac. Math. Newsl., 2 no. 4 (2012), 11-16.

Abstract. This article is about coherence in homological algebra, and =20=

only needs the elementary theory
of abelian groups and lattices. Its results are developed in a recent =20=

book to analyse spectral sequences =96
an important tool of homological algebra with applications in many =20
branches of mathematics.
----

The article deals with part of a conference at CatAlg2011, Gargnano =20
(Italy), in September 2011.
It is a reduced version of a preprint, 'Coherence and distributive =20
lattices in homological algebra',
that was announced in this list in January 2012.
The book referred to is:

'Homological Algebra, The interplay of homology with distributive =20
lattices and orthodox semigroups,
World Scientific Publishing Co., 2012.

Best regards to colleagues and friends

Marco Grandis
