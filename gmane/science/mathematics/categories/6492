Dear Fred,

Please forgive me, but let us distinguish between serious questions and
trivialities:

Andrej Bauer asked:

"...How exactly does this extend to generalized Boolean algebras?..."

And the answer is trivial (without quotation marks): The category GBA of
what he called generalized Boolean algebras is dually equivalent to the
category 1\STONE of pointed Stone spaces. This follows from Stone duality
(since GBA is equivalent to BA/2), but also extends it: just as BA is a
non-full subcategory of GBA, STONE can be considered as a non-full
subcategory of 1\STONE via the functor that adds base points. And this way
the dual equivalence between GBA and 1\STONE indeed extends the Stone
duality.

Although your first message about BA/2 was written after mine, I am sure you
know these things (you probably knew them before I knew the definition of a
category...)

Anyway, what I called the trivial answer is the full answer and we don't
need the Gelfand duality to motivate or explain it (even though the analogy
is correct).

Thinking further about partial maps simply means not thinking categorically:
look at the finite sets (or just sets) - would any categorically thinking
mathematician say that the category of pointed sets needs further
description as the category of finite sets and partial maps?

On the other hand, the "partial-map-version" of pointed Stone spaces is a
serious question even though it would not do any good to the question above.
Well, maybe the answer is known, but not to me. Naively, I don't think it is
as hopeless as you say. The reason is:

Let us take a pointed Stone space (X,x), and try to recover it from X-{x} (I
write "-" for the set-theoretic difference since I used "\" for something
else). Let us think about this in terms of ultrafilter convergence. Apart
from the principal ultrafilter generated by {x} every ultrafilter on X is of
the form T(i)(U), where T is the ultrafilter monad, i the inclusion map from
X-{x} to X, and U an ultrafilter on X-{x}. Knowing the topology of X-{x}, I
can recover the topology on X by requiring T(i)(U) to converge to the same
point in X-{x} as U and to converge to x if U does not converge to any
point. This indeed recovers X since every ultrafilter on a compact Hausdorff
space converges to a unique point (note also that T(i) is injective since i
is a split mono in SETS whenever X-{x} is non-empty).

I hope somebody on this mailing list will tell us that what I am saying is a
part of a well-known story and will give a reference, or am I missing
something?

What do you say?

Greetings - George
