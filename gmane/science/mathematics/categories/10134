We are pleased to announce the

School on Univalent Mathematics 2020,

to be held at the Palazzone di Cortona
(https://www.sns.it/en/palazzone-cortona), Cortona, Italy, July 27-31, 2020
(https://unimath.github.io/cortona2020/)

Overview
========
Homotopy Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies
a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type
theory. This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of
Univalent Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics
based on ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.

The UniMath library is a large repository of computer-checked
mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. It is based on the
computer proof assistant Coq.

In this school and workshop, we aim to introduce newcomers to the ideas
of Univalent Foundations and mathematics therein, and to the
formalization of
mathematics in a computer proof assistant based on Univalent Foundations.

Format
=======
Participants will receive an introduction to Univalent Foundations and
to mathematics in those foundations, by leading experts in the field. In
the accompanying problem sessions, they will formalize pieces of
univalent mathematics in the UniMath library.

More information on the format is given on the website
https://unimath.github.io/cortona2020 .
