I just realised (reading my post again on the mailing list)
that Tarski's axiom doesn't give the relative distances between these points,
so these labels (and the later remarks about fixing them) are invalid.
Of course, given Tarski's n + 1 points, you can find my n + 1 points,
and even do this algorithmically (using the Gram-Schmidt process),
so my other remarks hold only if you actually do this
(so that preserving the points means preserving the results
only after the Gram-Schmidt process has been applied).
Thus, the situation is a little less elegant than I implied
(but maybe that's Tarski's fault for phrasing his axiom so liberally ^_^).
