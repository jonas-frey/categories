Well, I actually know quite a bit more about it.  First off, each point in
the base has a local neighborhood whose sections are algebras and the
restrictions are homomorphisms.  I should have mentioned that all ops and
partial ops are finitary, but of increasing arity.  We know the answer is
positive; I am just unhappy with the proof.

The situation is that the stalks are integral domains.  Now integral
domains are not models of an LE theory.  But they are models of a theory
with an infinitude of LE operations (all finitary, but of increasing
arity) and I want the global sections to be
models of that theory (which turns out to characterize the rings in the
limit closure of the domains).  The space is the set of primes of some
arbitrary semi-prime (no nilpotents) commutative ring with the co-Zariski
topology.
