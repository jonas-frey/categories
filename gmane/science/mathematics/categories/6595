----------------------------------------------------------------

The Symposium on  Fundamentals of  Computation Theory was  established
in 1977 for researchers interested in all aspects of theoretical
computer science, as well as new emerging  fields such as
bio-inspired computing. It is a biennial series of conferences
previously held in Poznan (Poland, 1977), Wendisch-Rietz
(Germany,  1979),  Szeged (Hungary, 1981),  Borgholm (Sweden,  1983),
Cottbus (Germany, 1985),  Kazan (Russia, 1987),  Szeged (Hungary,
1989), Gosen-Berlin (Germany,  1991),  Szeged (Hungary,  1993),
Dresden (Germany,  1995), Krakow (Poland,  1997),  Iasi (Romania,
1999), Riga (Latvia,  2001), Malmo (Sweden, 2003), Lubeck (Germany,
2005), Budapest (Hungary, 2007), and Wroclaw (Poland, 2009).


PROCEEDINGS

The conference proceedings will be published  (as usual) in the
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series of Springer-Verlag.


SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original unpublished
research in all areas of theoretical computer science. Topics of
interest include (but are not limited to):

     * Algorithms:
           o algorithm design and optimization
           o combinatorics and analysis of algorithms
           o computational complexity
           o approximation, randomized, and heuristic methods
           o parallel and distributed computing
           o circuits and boolean functions
           o online algorithms
           o machine learning and artificial intelligence
           o computational geometry
           o computational algebra
     * Formal methods:
           o algebraic and categorical methods
           o automata and formal languages
           o computability and nonstandard computing models
           o database theory
           o foundations of concurrency and distributed systems
           o logics and model checking
           o models of reactive, hybrid and stochastic systems
           o principles of programming languages
           o program analysis and transformation
           o specification, refinement and verification
           o security
           o type systems
     * Emerging fields:
           o ad hoc, dynamic, and evolving systems
           o algorithmic game theory
           o computational biology
           o foundations of cloud computing and ubiquitous systems
           o quantum computation

Submissions (LNCS style, 12 pages max), should contain sufficient detail to
allow to evaluate its validity, quality, and relevance. If necessary,
proofs can be attached as an appendix. Simultaneous submission to other
conferences with published proceedings or journals is not allowed.  Paper
submission and reviewing is handled via Easychair:
