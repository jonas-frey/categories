Dear Paul,

I thank you very much for your insightful comments.

You are completely right.=20
I have my share of responsabilities here.
I will not try to explain what happened, because it may be =

I apologise to you and to everyone who may have suffered from not =

access to the information they wanted from me.
I am planning to correct the problem by publishing all my "secret" =

papers and books during 2010, starting this December.=20

It is too early to tell.

I think we should be wary of slapping ourselves on the back too much.

The fact is that category theory alienated the rest of the mathematical
world.   Since the damage had been done in the 1970s, well before my=20

I have never managed to work out how this happenned, or who was=20
