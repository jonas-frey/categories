Once upon a time I handwrote some incomplete notes on "skeletal"
representation theory
which started out looking at Mat (a skeleton of Vect) as a monoidal
category with direct sums
(the tensor product is Kronecker product of matrices). I tried to
strictify as much as possible
all the associativity, distributivity, . . constraints. I typed it at
some point. The pdf file has some
funny things (notably copyright signs!) in it but it has been on the
web (linked from my
Publications page) for quite awhile. Maybe it is the kind of thing
Hugo has in mind. But
remember, it is sort of "in progress"; no jokes please about "droup"
which is meant as
short for "dual group"!
