I also receive every week an invitation from people I Know (most are in
the cat-list) to join ResearchGate, and ignore these mails. I thought
this gate was a sort of "Who is Who". Is today Who is Who also a data
base ?.

I am not worry too much about all this because it is the future and we
have to adapt and learn to live with it. For example, if he likes, Obama
would be reading this mail, there is nothing we can do about it.

Cheers   Eduardo.
