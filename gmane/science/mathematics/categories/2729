(www.itu.dk/research/theory/ctcs2004/cmcim.html)

IT University of Copenhagen (ITU)
Copenhagen, Denmark
www.itu.dk

- affiliated with the 10th conference in Category Theory and Computer =20=

Science (CTCS 2004) ,August 12th-14th,
and Graduate Student Summer School in Category Theory and Computer =20
Science, August 9th-11th.

------------------------------------------------------------------------=20=

------------------------------------------
NEW:
- Extended workshop submission deadline: July 1st
- Accepted papers and abstracts for invited talks for CTCS available at =20=

------------------------------------------------------------------------=20=

-------------------------------------------

We invite submissions of short, extended abstracts (less than 5 pages) =20=

for an informal half-day workshop on Categorical Methods in =20
Concurrency, Interaction and Mobility. The workshop has previously been =20=

held in connection with CONCUR 2002 and CONCUR 2003.

There will be no formal proceedings of the workshop, informal =20
proceedings will be distributed at the workshop.
Thus, accepted material may be published elsewhere at a later date.

Submissions may present status reports, recent results, challenges, or =20=

work in progress

Topics of interest include:

    =95      categorical algebras of processes
    =95      categorical methods in game semantics and geometry of =
interaction
    =95      categorical models of term/graph rewriting or rewriting =
logic
    =95      Chu spaces
    =95      coalgebras, bialgebras, coinduction
    =95      comparing models of concurrency
    =95      enriched categories of processes
    =95      interaction categories
    =95      bigraphs
    =95      presheaf semantics

Workshop PARTICIPATION IS FREE, but REQUIRES REGISTRATION before 1st of =20=

July, by SENDING AN EMAIL to hilde@itu.dk, containing =20
`CMCIM2004-registration' in the subject, and your full name and =20
