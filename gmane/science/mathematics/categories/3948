Yes, indeed I did provide an equivalent definition:

At the risk of appearing pretentious, I'd like to quote Chekhov: de gusti=
bus,
aut bene aut nihil.  ;)

[Incidentally, I do like Chu categories, but I will play devil's advocate
here.]

...but not tensor-preserving?  I could just as easily say that Chu(Set,2)=
=20
is (equivalent to) a lluf subcategory of Rel^2 (2 here denoting the arrow
category), which is in turn (equivalent to) a full subcategory of Sup^2;=20
the latter carries a fascinating *-autonomous structure derived from thos=
e=20
of Sup and 2, and the composite embedding is duality-preserving (though o=
nly=20
the first part is "concrete-preserving"). =20

Word. =20

The trouble with (Dedekind-)infinite things is that one can argue about=20
which way is up and which way is down.  For example, both the forgetful
functor Sup ---> Pos, and its left adjoint can be regarded as "embeddings=
"
---thus one could perversely regard complete (semi)lattices as more, not
less, general than arbitrary posets. =20

I hope no-one would accuse me of "playing the ring theorist" on the=20
Internet or elsewhere, merely as a result of quoting some of the subject'=
s
most celebrated theorems.  [I was glad to learn that I have forgotten a=20
smaller chunk of my undergraduate education than I would have suspected.]=

Cheers,
Jeff.

P.S. It has been pointed out to me, by a reader of this list, that the=20
"conventional wisdom" I quoted in re the history of ideal theory is=20
flawed (as I suspected, for no deeper reason than a profound mistrust=20
of conventional wisdom).
