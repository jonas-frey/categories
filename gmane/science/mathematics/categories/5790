Dear Andre,

thank you for your very nice posting. If I understood correctly your=20
proof of stabilization hypothesis it is based on classical Freudenthal
theorem. I can not resist sketching another proof (this is joint work=20
with Clemens Berger and Denis-Charles Cisinski) from which Freudenthal=20
theorem is a consequence.

It is based on the use of higher braided operads. Classically one can=20
consider nonsymmetric, braided and symmetric operads with the values in=20
a symmetric monoidal category V. If V is in addition a model category=20
one can speak about contractible operads.  When V =3D Cat, for example,th=
e=20
category of  algebras of contractible nonsymmetric (braided, symmetric)=20
operads is (=3DQuillen equivalent) to the category of monoidal categories=
=20
(braided, symmetric). This prompts a line of thinking that the category=20
   of  k-braided (weak) n-categories must  be an algebra of a=20
contractible k-braided operad with values in Cat_n.

It is well known that we can not define k-braided operads in classical
terms (i.e. a sequence of objects with action of some groups  and a=20
compatible substitution). The contradiction here is that for a=20
contractible such operad to have a right homotopy type the  quotient of=20
   its m-th space  by group actions must have the homotopy type of space=20
of (nonordered) configuration of m-points in R^k. And this is not a=20
K(\pi,1) space unless k=3D1,2,\infty.

Nevertheless, one can overcome this difficulty if instead of group=20
action we consider an action of a category. Formally we consider a=20
category of quasibijections of k-ordinals (or maps of pruned k-trees,=20
which are bijections on the highest level) Q_k. The m-th connected=20
component of the nerve of this category has homotopy type of the space=20
of (nonordered) configuration of m-points in R^k. Then a k-collection is=20
a contravaliant functor Q_k --> V. One can construct a category of=20
operads  O_n(V) which have k-collections as underlying collections:

arXiv:0804.4165 Locally constant n-operads as higher braided operads. M.=20
A. Batanin.

Finally, we define a k-braided operad to be an object of O_k(V) such=20
that the action of any quasibijection is a weak equivalence. Obviously a=20
contractible k-operad is a k-braided operad.

We want, actually, a bit more and define a model category of k-braided=20
operads. This can be done by an appropriate Bousfield localization=20
O_k^loc(V) of the model category O_k(V). The fibrant objects in=20
O_k^loc(V) are precisely fibrant k-braided operads.

There is also a simple functor

    S: O_{k+1}(V) --> O_k(V)

induced by inclusion

s: Q_k --> Q_{k+1}

(add a tail to any pruned tree of height k).

This functor has a left adjoint, moreover, this pair of adjoint induces=20
a pair of Quillen functors between localised categories
   S^{loc}: O_{k+1}^{loc}(V) <=3D=3D> O_k^{loc}(V):F^{loc}

Theorem [Operadic stabilisation]:
Let V be n-truncated as a model category and k is greater or equal to n+2=
.
Then the Quillen adjunction
         S^{loc} |- F^{loc}
   is a Quillen equivalence. Moreover,
in this case the symmetrisation functor

sym:O_k^{loc}(V) --> SO(V)

is the left Quillen equivalence (SO(V) is the category of symmetric=20
operads).

Proof. It follows from an explicit calculation of the derived left Kan=20
extension along the functor s: Q_k --> Q_{k+1} and the fact that s=20
induces an isomorphism of the m-th homotopy groups of the nerves when
m < k-2 , k>2 (k=3D2 is special and corresponds to the canonical=20
homomorphism from  braid groups to symmetric groups).


Let us define the model category Br_k(V) of k-braided object in V as the=20
category of one object, one arrow, ..., one (k-1)-arrow algebras of a=20
contractible cofibrant k-operad. The (derived) Eckman-Hilton argument=20
shows that it is Quilen equivalent to the category E_k(V) of=20
E_k-algebras in V.


Let V be an n-truncated symmetric monoidal model category and k is=20
greater or equal to n+2.
Then the total left derived functor  LF^{loc}   map contractible=20
k-operads to contractible (k+1)-operads and Lsym map contractible=20
operads to E_{\infty}-operads. So we have a Quillen equivalence of the=20
categories

    E_k(V) --> Br_k(V) --> Br_{k+1}(Cat_n)--> E_{\infty}(V).

Corollary 1[BBD stabilization hypothesis]
Take V=3DCat_n (for example, Cat_n =3D Rezk n-categories).

Corollary 2 [Freudenthal theorem]
   V =3D n-homotopy types.

I have little understanding of Goodwillie calculus but I know that=20
operads play an important role in it.
It would be very interested to see what corresponds in calculus to=20
operadic stabilization.

with best regards,
Michael.
