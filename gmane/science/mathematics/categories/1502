FMCS2000


Foundational Methods in Computer Science


JUNE 1st - 4th, 2000


The Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia, in
cooperation with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is
hosting the Foundational Methods in Computer Science workshop from
June 1 to June 4, 2000, on the University of British Columbia Campus
in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.

The workshop is an informal meeting to bring together researchers in
mathematics and computer science with a focus on the applications of
category theory in computer science.

The reception in the evening of June 1, 2000, at Walter Gage Towers, is
followed by a day of tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to category
theory, followed by a day and a half of research talks. There will be a
few invited presentations, but the majority of the talks are solicited
from the participants. Student participation is particularly encouraged
at FMCS.
