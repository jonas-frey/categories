"Asymmetric spaces" doesn't give relevant hits in google, but
"asymmetric topology does". People have considered "quasi-uniform
spaces" (losing the symmetry in the same way as metric spaces with
Lavwere's work), and much more. An interesting example, which has shown
up in topos theory via the work of Johnstone, are stably locally compact
spaces/locales, where the patch modification makes (coreflectively) such
spaces symmetric. Some people use two topologies on the same set, or two
subframes of a frame that generate, or variations of this idea.
Symmetric spaces give "positive and negative information", and
asymmetric ones give one of the two only. Some people argue that it is
good to keep the topologies of positive and of negative information
separate. Anyway, I just wanted to say that there is a large body of
work on this. Whether it is relevant for the original question I don't
know, but it is relevant for Barr's subquestion. MHE.
