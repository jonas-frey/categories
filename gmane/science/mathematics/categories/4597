There is an embedding theorem on which we have put Cayley's name:
if M is a monoid in a closed category then the structural coretraction
M --> [M,M] into the endohom is a nice monoid map.

A bicategorical version of this gives a nice module (distributor) A
--|--> A^{op} #A
for any (pro)monoidal V-category A. This leads to a monoidal
embedding of any
such A into the category of A-bimodules. (E.g. see Section 4 of
Pastro-St:
http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/21/4/21-04.pdf
however Brian Day also knew about these things.)

So the abstract case is not so much more abstract. I think Peter
Johnstone says
somewhere that one view of the Abelian Category Embedding Theorem is not
so much that it means we should use module-proofs to work in abelian
categories
but rather, when working in categories of modules, we might as well
work in an
abelian category. I think the same applies here for monoidal categories.
The coring people I have spoken to seem quite comfortable with
this development. Luckily we all have our own sources of motivation.
