Dear John,

i have always taken this situation

There are *several* definitions that are almost surely "right" and likely
> to

be studied for many years hence.  There is no particular reason to expect

that one definition will be best for all applications - but there's a lot
> of

reason to expect that all the "right" definitions will be shown to be

equivalent (in a rather subtle sense).


to be a pretty clear critique of category theory's basic formulation. This
may be too idealistic, but i've always felt that an ideally robust
formulation would admit a meta-theory that makes n-categories "just fall
out". The fact that they are so hard to formulate suggests that the basic
design of the original presentation misses something crucial.

i confess that taken together with the fact that it is exceptionally hard to
get categorical composition to line up with parallel composition (in the
sense of concurrent computation) in a manner that respects Curry-Howard, has
really made me evaluate category theory as still very much a work in
progress.

Personally, i have wondered if there is a presentation that takes monad as
the fundamental building block. i think this might not be too much of a
stretch goal, actually, as monad as polymorphic comprehension is now
well-established.

Best wishes,

--greg
