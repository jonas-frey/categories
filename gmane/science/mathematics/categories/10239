[There will be no physical ETAPS in Dublin this autumn. Instead, on
2 July 2020, we will hold an online ETAPS 2020 afternoon. The authors
of papers accepted to the main conferences of ETAPS 2020 will get an
opportunity to present their work at ETAPS 2021 in Luxembourg.]


The ETAPS EC and ETAPS 2020 LOC regret to announce that the plan of a
postponed physical ETAPS in Dublin in autumn 2020 has become
unrealistic. We will follow the following substitute plan.

- We will hold a 3-hour virtual online ETAPS 2020 event in the
   afternoon of Thu 2 July 2020, see the call below.

   Everyone is most welcome to attend. There will be no registration,
   no fee.

- The authors of papers accepted to the main conferences of ETAPS 2020
   will get an opportunity to present their work at ETAPS 2021 in
   Luxembourg, Sat-Thu 27 March-1 April 2021. The exact arrangements
   for this move will be announced.

- The workshop organizers will individually decide and announce
   whether, when and in what format their workshops will take place.

- The local organizers of ETAPS 2020 will reimburse the fees collected
   (minus some administrative charge) according to a policy and a
   procedure to be announced.

Thank you for your understanding!
