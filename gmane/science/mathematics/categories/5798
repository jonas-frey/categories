Dear Michael,

A basic ingredient in my approach to higher categories is the notion
of complete Segal space introduced by Rezk.
I have learned Rezk theory in proving the Quillen equivalence=20
between quasi-categories and complete Segal spaces.
In my "Notes on Quasi-categories" I am introducing
an abstract notion of complete Segal space called
*Rezk category*, or *reduced category*.
A category object (internal to a quasi-category) is said=20
to be *reduced* if its object of objects is=20
*isomorphic* to its object of isomorphisms via the unit map.=20
(an isomorphism in a quasi-category is an arrow which
is invertible in the homotopy category).
An ordinary category (in set) is reduced iff every
isomorphism is a unit, a very stringent condition.
Ordinary categories are seldom reduced (posets are).
Every reduced category is skeletal.
An equivalence between reduced categories is necessarly=20
an isomorphism. In contrast, there are plenty of=20
reduced categories in homotopy theory.
In fact every category internal to the quasi-category of spaces
is *equivalent*  to a reduced category (via a fully faith ess surj =
functor).
This key result was proved by Rezk for complete Segal spaces:
every Segal category is *equivalent* to a complete Segal space.
The theory of reduced categories is essentially (homotopy) algebraic=20
(unlike ordinary category theory in which we need to expand the notion=20
of isomorphism (of categories) with that of equivalence).

I do not have the time to explain more of the idea of my proof now.=20
A sketch can be found in my "Notes on Quasi-categories".

I hope I will understand this time!
I always find our conversation very stimulating!

See you in Genoa,
