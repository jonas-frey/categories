Dear Jiri

Thank you for advising us of this loss.
While I met Vera Trnkova only a few times
(she seemed to like travelling even less than me),
I saw her as a mathematician who could push
well beyond the barriers that blocked everyone else.

You and your colleagues have my sympathy.

Best regards,
Ross
