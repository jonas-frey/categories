Scope
-----

Studying logics via semantics is a well-established and very active
branch of mathematical logic, with many applications, in computer
science and elsewhere. The area is characterized by results, tools
and techniques stemming from various fields, including universal
algebra, topology, category theory, order, and model theory. The
program of the conference TACL 2011 will focus on three
interconnecting mathematical themes central to the semantical study
of logics and their applications: algebraic, categorical, and
topological methods. This is the fifth conference in the series
Topology, Algebra and Categories in Logic (TACL, formerly TANCL).
Earlier installments of this conference have been organized in
Tbilisi (2003), Barcelona (2005), Oxford (2007), Amsterdam (2009).


Featured topics
---------------

Contributed talks can deal with any topic dealing with the use of
algebraic, categorical or topological methods in either logic or
computer science. This includes, but is not limited to, the following
areas:

* Algebraic structures in CS
* Algebraic logic
* Coalgebra
* Categorical methods in logic
* Domain theory
* Fuzzy and many-valued logics
* Lattice theory
* Lattices with operators
* Modal logics
* Non-classical logics
* Ordered topological spaces
* Ordered algebraic structures
* Pointfree topology
* Proofs and Types
* Residuated structures
* Semantics
* Stone-type dualities
* Substructural logics
* Topological semantics of modal logic

* Steve Awodey, Carnegie Mellon University
* Lev Beklemishev, Steklov Mathematical Institute Moscow
* David Gabelaia, Tbilisi Razmadze Mathematical Institute
* Nikolaos Galatos, University of Denver
* Pierre Gillibert, Charles University Prague
* Jean Goubault-Larrecq, ENS Cachan, CNRS, INRIA

Esakia session
--------------

The Fifth International Conference on Topology, Algebra and Categories
in Logic is dedicated to the memory of Leo Esakia (1934-2010).

In Leo's honour there will be a special session during the conference;=20
three of the invited speakers will be giving their talk in this session:=20
Lev Beklemishev, David Gabelaia, and Mamuka Jibladze. In addition, a=20
memorial talk on the life and work of Leo Esakia will delivered by the=20
chair of this session, Guram Bezhanishvili.

The program committee specially encourages submissions related to the=20
work of Leo Esakia, and may select some of these submission for=20
presentation at the special session.

Submissions
-----------

Contributed presentations will be of two types:

* standard presentations of 20 minutes in parallel sessions,
* featured, 30 minutes long, plenary presentations.

The submission of an extended abstract in pdf format will be required to =
be
selected for a contributed presentation of either kind.

Concerning the standard presentations, while preference will be given to
new work, results that have already been published or presented=20
elsewhere will also be considered.
Concerning the featured presentations: the program committee will choose
a small number of submissions of which the authors will be invited to
give a plenary presentation. The criteria for this selection will be:
originality, significance and interest to the wider TACL community.

There will be just one submission procedure, for contributed=20
presentations of either kind: authors are requested to submit a short=20
text of four pages, in English and in pdf format, through the easychair=20
submission site:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtacl2011

Important dates
---------------

April 18, 2011: Abstract submission deadline
May 20, 2011:   Notification to authors
July 26-30, 2011:  Conference
