Dear All,=C2=A0

Loday's model is for pointed spaces, and Grothendieck was critical of this =
in a letter to me in 1983, of which I have quoted part in the Indag Paper o=
n my preprint page. =C2=A0I did not worry about this in the 1980s since the=
  immediate consequences were quite novel. For example, Ellis and Steiner so=
lved the old problem of the critical group for (n+1)-ads, and the nonabelia=
n tensor product of groups has been well developed by group theorists (see =
www.groupoids.org.uk/nonabtens.html).=C2=A0

What has not been looked at is an input of crossed modules over groupoids, =
instead of over groups, and considering first the work of Ellis-Steiner in =
that light.=C2=A0(crossed n-cubes of groupoids?)

We know from examples that strict 2-fold groupoids are more complicated tha=
n homotopy 2-types, see my preprint =C2=A0arXiv:0903.2627v2; and the van Ka=
mpen theorem with Loday has not so far been given a version with many base =
points, unlike the version in the book Nonabelian Algebraic Topology.=C2=A0

The philosophy given in the Indag Paper has relatively  recently been put i=
n this form, and so no part of it was discussed with Grothendieck, except t=
he idea that n-fold groupoids model homotopy n-types, which, as said above,=
  is not quite correct, though he thought it "absolutely beautiful". At that=
  time, 1985,  he was starting to write "Recollte et Semaille", a task which=
  seemed to lead him away from mathematics. =20

The work with Loday shows in many explicit examples how low dimensional ide=
ntifications in topology can give rise to high dimensional homotopy invaria=
nts, and there are explicit and precise calculations using the higher van K=
ampen theorems. Such calculation  is not the only aim, but it does give a u=
seful test.=20

Best=20

Dear All,

Can I ask why Loday's cat^n groups are not mentioned? (They have been
now.)  I know they are not globular, but by spreading out the `weakness' of
the higher groupoid structures the axioms end up being strict (and very
simple as they are really just abstractions of classical commutator
identities).  Surely they deserve to be used as a reference point to
compare some of the other candidates. Loday's models work for *all *n-types
for finite n. (I do not know how to handle general homotopy types using any
similar methodology.)

Tim
