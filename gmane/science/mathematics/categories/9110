Dear Christopher,
What I, personally, mean by structure is not the point. This word is =20
used, very often, in mathematical texts. Sometimes giving the =20
impression that it has a precise meaning on which the community of =20
mathematicians agree. And I was sure there was at least one definition =20=

on which the majority of users did agree

Then I received 3 answers all referring to: The joy of Cats, but =20
different:
For Carsten F=C3=BChrman, only faithfulness is required, which obviously =
is =20
not enough
Jiri Adamek adds: an isomorphism in S is an identity if its image is. =20=

I agree with this; but again not enough.
Thomas Streicher adds a third condition, with which I would probably =20
agree if was sure of the precise meaning of isofibration. Could you =20
please, even at the risk of being pedantic say what you mean by that

Many thanks to all
