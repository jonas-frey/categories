The bad news, I report now with considerable consternation, is that some
inexplicable bit-rot -- or, possibly, a virus --seems to have turned seve=
ral
other HTML pages of mine into a Kanji/ASCII hodge-podge. The pages affect=
ed
are those linked to by link-text including the label "JaMex" (monicker of=
  a
Topology conference held in Japan in December of 2007) -- title/topic of
central interest: Hahn-Banach Theorem.

A clean version of one of them, at least, is to be found here:

: http://at.yorku.ca/cgi-bin/abstract/cavy-35 .

But if anyone actually daring, despite the possible threat of potential v=
irus
damage, to analyse those few pages can suggest means whereby to reverse t=
heir
bit-rot, and to reconstitute their original content, I would be forever
grateful!

Cheers, -- Fred Linton =
