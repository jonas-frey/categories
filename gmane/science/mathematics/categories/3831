Fellow Category Theorists,

The website for PSSL86 is now open, including a list of suggested
hotels and the registration page, in two languages.

http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/psslHomeEN.html
http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/psslHomeFR.html

We are asking you to use the registration page to inform us of your
intention to attend. The process is quite informal, but we need to
keep track of how many people are coming, in order to prepare for the
catering. There are no registration fees, but those who want to attend
the Saturday banquet will be asked for a moderate sum.

See you soon in Nancy,

Fran=E7ois Lamarche

PSSL86 IN NANCY

The 86th edition of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will
be held at the Institut =C9lie Cartan (IECN) on the Universit=E9 Henri
Poincar=E9 campus in Nancy, France, on the weekend of September 8-9
2007. We intend to continue the PSSL tradition of informality, and to
schedule talks pertaining to any aspect of category theory, with or
without applications in natural science, logic, computer science, or
other branches of mathematics.

The schedule will be announced shortly before the event.
