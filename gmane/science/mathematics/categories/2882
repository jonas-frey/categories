I don't quite understand who is retaliating for what in the posted comment.

Even though this is not strictly speaking category theory, I will take
the further liberty to tell you the whole story.

The above limit cropped up when I told my students in "Computer Science
I" to bring examples of problems they do in Analysis and Algebra. The
idea was to solve them using Mathematica. Someone bought the above
limit, except that instead of the parameter 'a' he had the constant 'e'
(base of natural logarithm). Now, as it happens, in Mathematica this
constant is written 'E' instead of 'e'. The student of course typed in
'e' which Mathematica took as a "free parameter" and gave the "generic"
answer 0, while the correct answer was 6. It took a while to explain the
whole mess. I suspect the only thing the students learned was that (a)
the limit is stupid, (b) Mathematica is stupid and (c) the teacher is a
pedantic fanatic.

By the way, to see what is going on in the above limit, draw a family of
functions for various values of 'a' approaching and passing through a=e.
All will be clear as you see two "waves" passing through each other.

I guess I am trying to point out that current Computer Alegbra Systems
are very tricky to use _correctly_. In Mathematica's defense it should
be said that it also found a couple of errors where the Analsyis teacher
did not (one involved cancelling "a common factor of b" between b^2 and
sqrt(b^2) for a real parameter b).
