		1st CALL FOR PAPERS -- CSL 2000

		    Annual Conference of the
	European Association for Computer Science Logic

	Fischbachau/Munich, Germany, August 21-26, 2000

CSL is the annual conference of the European Association for
Computer Science Logic (EACSL). The conference is intended for
computer scientists whose research activities involve logic, as
well as for logicians working on issues significant for computer
science. Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest are:

* automated deduction and interactive theorem proving
* categorical logic and topological semantics
* constructive mathematics and type theory
* domain theory
* equational logic and term rewriting
* finite model theory, database theory
* higher order logic
* lambda and combinatory calculi
* logical aspects of computational complexity
* logical foundations of programming paradigms
* logic programming, constraints
* linear logic
* modal and temporal logics
* model checking
* program extraction
* program logics and semantics
* program specification, transformation and verification
