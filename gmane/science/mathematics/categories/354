Dear Colleague,

We invite you to join us in Montreal next May for a special three-day
conference in honour of Michael Barr's sixtieth birthday. The meeting
will take place the last three days of May. The following students,
mentors, and friends of Mike have agreed to participate as invited
speakers:  Peter Chu, Jack Duskin, Peter Freyd, Murray Gerstenhaber,
John Kennison, Jim Lambek, Fred Linton, Saunders MacLane, Michael
Makkai, James Otto, John Power, Myles Tierney, Don VanOsdol, Charles
Wells.

We will have time for a limited number of other speakers.  In keeping
with the spirit of the conference, we ask that talks be concerned with
one of the subjects to which Mike Barr has contributed:  Homological
algebra, triples, embeddings, exact catgeories, torsion theories, topos
theory, topology, *-autonomous categories, universal algebra, logic,
computer science, or linguistics.  If you wish to give a talk, send your
request as soon as possible to Tom Fox at the address below.  The
conference proceedings will be published in a special number of the
Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra.

We will meet in the Bronfman Building, 1001 Sherbrooke West. The first
talk will be at 9:00, May 29th.  Registration will take place the
morning of the 29th from 8:30-9:00 and during the morning break.  There
will be a registration fee of $80 for faculty, $40 for students,
including a dinner/party to be held Friday evening.  Please let us know
