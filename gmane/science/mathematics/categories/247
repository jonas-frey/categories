I forward the message below from Klaas Landsman.

==============================================================
I have a vacancy for a PhD student on the project  "Topos theory,
noncommutative geometry, and quantum logic", starting at a negotiable
date in 2009.
A detailed description of the project is available at
<http://www.math.ru.nl/~landsman/NWOVC2008.pdf
<http://www.math.ru.nl/%7Elandsman/NWOVC2008.pdf>>. The position is for
four years
(with an initial one-year appointment subject to extension to four years
on satisfactory performance), and is financed by NWO. PhD positions in
the Netherlands carry a decent salary (going up from about 2000 euro per
month gross initially to about 3000 euro in the final year), and the
local group of PhD students in mathematics and mathematical physics is
exceptionally nice. Moreover, the mathematical physics group at Nijmegen
is embedded in the GQT-cluster (see <www.gqt.nl <http://www.gqt.nl>>),
officially called "The Fellowship of Geometry and Quantum Theory."
Relevant to this project, among its other members
are Ieke Moerdijk and Gunther Cornelissen.

Applications are welcomed by May 15, 2009, using snail mail (accompanied
by a very brief email to <landsman@math.ru.nl> <mailto:landsman@math.ru.nl>
to announce your application) to  Prof.dr. N.P. Landsman, Radboud
Universiteit Nijmegen, Faculty of Science,
IMAPP, Heyendaalseweg 135, 6525 AJ NIJMEGEN, THE NETHERLANDS. Please
include a letter of motivation, a copy or draft
of of your M.Sc. Thesis, a list of courses (including marks), and the
names and email addresses of two or three senior
academics who could provide information about yourself. Please do not
ask them to send references yourself.
Female mathematicians or theoretical physicists (with a strong
background in mathematics) are especially encouraged to apply.
