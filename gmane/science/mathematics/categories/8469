Dear Colleagues,

I have an opening for a postdoc, as described in the ad below. In addition to
accepting applications, I am very happy to respond to informal enquiries about
any aspect of the position, from technical ones to ones about life in a
beautiful, "alternative" mountain town in western North Carolina.

Best wishes,
-patricia

**************
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral researcher in the Computer Science
Department at Appalachian State University. The position is part of the
NSF-funded project 'Relational Parametricity for Program Verification'.
Relational parametricity is a key technique for formally verifying properties
of software systems, and logical relations, upon which parametricity is based,
provide a means of proving properties of a software system directly from the
system itself. The goal of the project is to improve the current
state-of-the-art in the theory and application of parametricity by providing an
axiomatic framework for the construction of logical relations that is
principled, conceptually simple, comprehensive, uniform (rather than ad hoc),
predictive, and more widely applicable than already existing techniques.

The ideal applicant will have a strong background in logical relations,
functional programming, type theory, and category theory, although more
expertise in one area may compensate for less in another. The successful
applicant will also be excited about working on fundamental research questions
on the themes of parametricity and language-based program verification. They
will work with Prof Patricia Johann and project partners, and will also have
the opportunity to initiate subprojects appropriate to their own (related)
interests. The duration of the position is one year, with the possibility of
continuation by mutual agreement if additional external funding is secured. The
position will start at a mutually agreeable time in the second half of the 2015
calendar year. Compensation will be highly competitive and commensurate with
experience.

Interested persons should first contact Patricia Johann at
johannp@cs.appstate.edu, briefly outlining their academic background and
research interests. A complete application will consist of a cover letter and
CV, including contact information for three references. Complete applications
should be sent to:

Patricia Johann
Department of Computer Science
Appalachian State University
Boone, NC 28607 USA

Initial review of applications will begin on 31 March 2015 and continue until
the position is filled.
