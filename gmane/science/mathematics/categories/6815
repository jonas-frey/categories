Dear categorists,

I finally found a copy of Lawvere's 1962 preprint, thanks to the =
assistance of Kirk Sturtz. I'd like to thank you all for your help in =
locating it.

For the record, there is apparently a photocopy of it in Gian-Carlo =
Rota's papers in the American Institute of Mathematics library:

   =
http://www.aimath.org/library/library.cgi?database=3Dreprints;mode=3Ddispl=
ay;Title=3D;Author=3Dlawvere;Codenumber=3D14044

Kirk kindly sent me a scanned copy of this photocopy (with Kirk's own =
annotations).

Cheers,
Jeremy
