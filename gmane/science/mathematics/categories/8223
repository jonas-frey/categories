[Ross: Any comments?]

Dear Jean,

I wasn't properly aware of those issues around choosing iso or equality, so i=
t's lucky I got into this discussion. My intuition of what you are saying is=
  that with iso, roughly speaking, the reindexing is only pseudofunctorial. Fo=
r example, if you pull back along the diagonal B -> =CE=A6B, to get the rein=
dexing along identities, then you get an endofunctor of each fibre that is i=
somorphic to the identity. Am I on the right lines? Is this all written down=
  somewhere?

After your messages I noticed that Street has a remark after his proposition=
, whose significance I overlooked:

"Compare the above proposition with Gray [2] p.56; so we have related the de=
finition of 0-fibration here with the definition of opfibration in [2] when K=
  =3D Cat. Notice that the unit of the adjunction l -| p~ for Gray is not jus=
t an isomorphism but an identity. It is worth pointing out the reason for th=
is since we will need the observation in the next paper. A 0-fibration will b=
e called normal when there is a normalized pseudo L-algebra structure on it.=
  In Cat every 0-fibration is normal, but in other categories this need not b=
e the case. In the proof of the Chevalley criterion, if =CE=B6 is an identit=
y then so is =CE=B7. So, for a normal 0-fibration,
p~ : =CE=A6E -> p/B has a left adjoint with unit an identity."

Notes:
1. Gray [2] =3D "Fibred and cofibred categories", La Jolla.
2. I don't know which paper Street means by "the next paper".
3. In a pseudo L-algebra E, with structure morphism c: LE -> E, =CE=B6 denot=
es the isomorphism from Id_E to unit composed with c. E is normalized if =CE=
=B6 is equality.
4. =CE=B7 is the unit of the adjunction.

But that seems to claim that in Cat it doesn't matter whether you use iso or=
  equality in the Chevalley condition. Does that accord with your understandi=
ng?

Regards,

Steve.
