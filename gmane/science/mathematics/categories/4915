Dusko,

let me just notice that we are maintaining a *free software* tool
that actually is built upon categorical ideas (using Goguen's
and Burstall's institutions) and that computes colimits
(there is a menu Edit -> Proofs -> Compute Colimit

http://www.dfki.de/sks/hets

It is published under a free license, so you can freely download
the binaries, the source, modify the source, and republish your
improvements under the license.

Best,
Till
