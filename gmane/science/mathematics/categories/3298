Dear Mike:
   One reference is the work of M-F Coste-Roy and H. Lombardi in Real
Algebraic Geometry; a quick Google search yielded:

http://hlombardi.free.fr/publis/AMega90-1.html

Also they have some papers in the J.ACM, apparently.

In fact, it seems to be a huge area of model theory:  see

				Cheers,
				Phil
