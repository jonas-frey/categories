As Toby noted, the functor is x2.  However it is more than merely
analogous, it is the dual of +1 when 2 is taken to be the dual of 1 (as
with the original Stone duality for Boolean algebras, more generally
distributive lattices, more generally yet Chu(Set,2)), product of course
being the dual of sum.

By "1-level" do you mean first order?  *-autonomous categories
constitute a natural elementary notion of abstract Stone duality that is
self-dual.  What advantage of the elementary fragment of ASD over
*-autonomous categories justifies its failure of duality?  And how does
the *-autonomous abstraction of Stone duality relate to ASD's
abstraction of it?

In general 2 is not the dual of 1.  In order to exhibit a duality
between N and 2^N, they should be defined in a self-dual category that
does make 2 the dual of 1.  The most general such that I'm aware of is
Chu(Set,2) --- Chu(Set,3) embeds Chu(Set,2) (in 3x2 = 6 ways) but it
makes 3 the dual of 1.  If you know of another category that makes 2 the
dual of 1 that does not embed in Chu(Set,2) I'm all ears.  In situations
where 2 is not the dual of 1 it's not clear to me why one should expect
2^N to turn out to be dual to N in a way where all properties of one
have their dual counterpart of the other; in Chu(Set,K) the natural
functor for a final coalgebra dual to N is FX = XxK.

In the context of duality the way to think about X in a Chu space
(A,X,r) is that it is the dual of A, with the relation r characterizing
  the particular duality: the dual of (A,X,r) is (X,A,r^) where r^ is
the converse of r.  The first component constitutes the underlying set
while the second can be thought of as a generalized frame of open sets,
generalized by dispensing with the traditional frame operations of
finite meets and arbitrary sups, with r simply the binary relation of
membership of points in open sets.

For this reason, absent alternatives to Chu(Set,2) there is no
alternative to taking 1 to be the Chu space (1,2) if you want 2 to turn
out to be the dual of 1.  Note that in doing so 2 becomes the Chu space
(2,1), the coarsest possible consistent topology on 2 (thinking of (2,0)
as inconsistent).  It should be distinguished from discrete 2 = 1+1,
which is (2,4).

Taking 1 in Chu(Set,2) to be the discrete Chu space (1,2), the initial
algebra for +1 is (1,2) + (1,2) + ... = (N,2^N), 2^N being the power set
of N, a complete atomic Boolean algebra.  The final coalgebra for x2
when 2 = (2,1), as the dual of the initial algebra for +1, is the dual
of (N,2^N), namely (2^N,N).

If ASD makes 2 the dual of 1 then it's suspiciously non-abstract.  The
only framework I know of for analyzing this duality is Chu(Set,K) for K
= 2.  Any larger K doesn't work, the concreteness of Chu(Set,3) etc.
notwithstanding, unless you set things up so that the final coalgebra of
the functor XxK is independent of the cardinality of K (which can be
done as Bill Lawvere noted long ago, making 3^N equivalent to 2^N, but
I'd be very impressed if ASD incorporated Bill's machinery).

In Chu(Set,2), if one takes X in (A,X,r) to be the open sets, with
r(a,x) membership of a in x, then (N,2^N,r) is discrete (the discrete
Chu spaces over 2 being those of the form (A,2^A,r)), Hausdorff (by
discreteness), not compact (because infinite and discrete), and overt
(because spatial, Elephant C3.1.16).

There are two ways of computing which of these four properties
(2^N,N,r^) has, depending on whether one applies the elementary
definitions of the properties to the "chupology" (taking r^ to be the
converse of membership, i.e. a subset of N can "belong" to an element of
N), or organizes 2^N as a topological Boolean algebra with the (Stone)
topology serving to make it a CABA so that the continuous ultrafilters
are all and only the elements of N, in order for the duality to work.
Here are the two ways, alongside what Paul claims for comparison.

Chupology   not compact   not Hausdorff   not discrete  ?~?overt?
Stone          compact       Hausdorff    not discrete  overt
Paul           compact       Hausdorff    not discrete  overt

(The chupology is not compact because the whole space is not open, in
fact {} is not "in" any natural number.  It is not Hausdorff because no
two opens are disjoint to begin with.  And it's obviously not discrete.
  However unless there's a definition of "overt" meaningful for all
chupologies I don't know what "overt" would mean for chupologies whose
open sets don't form frames---they do in (N,2^N) but not in (2^N,N).)

Interestingly we have perfect agreement between the usual Stone topology
one imposes on a Boolean algebra to make it a CABA (to make the duality
work) and the topology Paul has in mind for 2^N.  Paul, is this because
you have in mind the Stone topology, with 2^N obviously being spatial
hence overt, or for some other reason?

If the former then that is the "precise point where the symmetry breaks
down:"  you don't take the precise dual of this when dualizing back to
(N,2^N), which you leave instead as the original Chu space (N,2^N).
This is a perfectly fine discrete, Hausdorff, overt, but not compact
space, again in perfect agreement with you.  However comparing it with
the topology of a topological Boolean algebra is apples to oranges.

If the latter however then I have no explanation and the ball is back in
your court.
