Dear all,=20

Thank you for all answers. But they do not give what I want. I am looking f=
or=20
a -R-I-G-H-T- adjoint, and by comparing the example I have and the limit=20
theory axiomatizing the category of small categories (for which the forgetf=
ul=20
functor Mod(T)-->Set does not have any right adjoint since it is not=20
colimit-preserving), i found (maybe) the following sufficient condition:=20

If T is a limit theory without equality symbol before the implication signs=
,=20
then any forgetful functor Mod(T) --> Mod(T') has a right adjoint.

Indeed, all sentences of T are of the form (Ax)(F(x)=3D>((E!y)G(x,y)) where=
 F(x)=20
and G(x,y) are conjunctions of atomic formulas. By hypothesis, F does not=20
contain the symbol =3D. So the forgetful functor Mod(T) --> Mod(T') is coli=
mit=20
preserving. Since Mod(T) is locally presentable, it is cocomplete,=20
cowellpowered and has a strong generator. So by SAFT, the forgetful functor=
=20
Mod(T) --> Mod(T') has a right adjoint.

Does it sound good ?

Thanks in advance. pg.
