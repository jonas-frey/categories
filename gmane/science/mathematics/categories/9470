Natural Transformations are homomorphisms of Functors. Working in a
dependently-typed setting, this becomes very clear. You don't even need
to go to HoTT to see this.

By this I mean that if you work 'syntactically', and figure out what it
means for a presentation of a theory X to have homomorphisms, then the
presentation of Functors qua theory has a natural (ha!) notion of
homomorphism, which turns out to be Natural Transformations 'on the nose'.
