Dear Fred,

The Tetralemma principle is too simplistic. In reality, P may be
interpreted in a variety of situations, with different analyses.

Some good examples come from typos theory. Consider P as "changing y to
o [is good]". In the context of the string "gyyd" it is good, for the
string "definitely not" it is definitely not, while for "typos" it
depends on further analysis.

There is a typology induced on the strings by the amount of "further
analysis" that is needed, and in boundary cases it can be infinite. For
these we effectively have neither P nor ~P.

Typos theory is very formal, but you can clearly see the same principle
in your example, "change is good". It depends on the context. In some it
evidently is good, in some it evidently is not, and in some (as with the
remark attributed to Mao Tse Tung about the French revolution) it seems
always to be too early to tell.

Merry Christmas,

Steve.
