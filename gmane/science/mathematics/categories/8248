Dear Jean, this mail is a valuable contribution to the subject.
Concerning your last comments about crediting it, I suggest you put  a
title like "Comments on fibrations and foliations" or any other of the
sort, and you upload it to the arXiv. In this way, it will have a wider
distribution (its interest is not limited to this list) and even it will
be possible to put it in the references of any paper and book if the
author has a fair perception of your contributions.

best regards  e.d.
