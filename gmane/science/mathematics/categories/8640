Jim died just a year ago today.  I have a file of his recent papers (MR 
lists an astonishing 19 items published between 2001 and 2013 (plus there 
was a book, unreviewed).  I have gathered most of them and put them on a 
web site.  Right now the address is 
http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/lambek/pdffiles/ but I hope 
to get our sysop to relocate it to a better location and to put a link on 
his department page (look under faculty; the last section is called "In 
memoriam").

Many of the papers are downloaded from the published source.  They can be 
identified by the full citation that accompanies them. The rest I compiled 
from tex sources that Elaine Swan, his typist, was kind enough to send me. 
There is some duplication since it was not always clear which was the 
latest version.  some day, I hope to sort this out.  Note that the 
majority of the papers are on linguistics.

Michael
