Dear Andrej,

The following formulation of your question has negative answers:

Let Cat be the category of small categories and functors between them,
and SCat be its full sub-category of small categories in which all
epis split. Let U : SCat -> Cat be the full inclusion.

U does not have a left adjoint, nor a right adjoint.

Proof:

Let C be the following category:
It has 3 objects:
0 - an initial object
A and B.

Apart from the identities and the initial maps, C has the following 3 morphisms:
a parallel pair f, g : A -> B
an endomorphism h : B -> B

The non-trivial compositions are given by:

x o h = x, for x = f, g, and h.

Note that C is in SCat, as it has no trivial epimorphisms: the
non-trivial arrow into A equalises f and g, which are different, and
the non-trivial arrows into B equalise h and id.

Let F : C -> C be the endofunctor that swaps f with g.

If U had a left adjoint, then SCat was a full reflective subcategory
of Cat, it was complete. Consider the equaliser of F, Id : C->C.
Whatever it is in SCat, this coequaliser cannot be preserved by U, as
the equaliser in Cat is given by dropping f and g. This resulting
subcategory has an epi, the initial arrow into A, that doesn't split.

Similarly, if U had a right adjoint, then SCat was cocomplete. Then
the coequaliser of F, Id : C->C in Cat would be C with g dropped
(=identified with f).  But then the initial map into A becomes epi,
without a section. Thus this colimit is not in SCat, and U doesn't
preserve it.

The same construction actually lies within the category Cat_ac that
Richard described (with specified sections), as C has no non-trivial
sections. Thus the same proof applies to his formulation, and his
forgetful functor also isn't a right nor a left adjoint.

Ohad.
