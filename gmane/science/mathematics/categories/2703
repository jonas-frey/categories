See (for the dual situation) an old paper of mine:

Adjoint lifting theorems for categories of algebras, Bull London Math.
Soc. 7 (1975), 294--297.

I should say (before others say it for me) that this was not the first
place the result appeared: it (and much more) was in the famous
unpublished (and largely unwritten) thesis of Bill Butler. But Gaunce
asked for a published reference.
