Dear Michael and Marco,

   as addition to Marco's answer, I would propose the following
notation: for any pair of composable arrows f:A-->B and g:B-->C denote
by H(g,f) the cokernel of ker(gf)-->ker(g), or (what amounts to the same
in an abelian category),  the kernel of coker(f)-->coker(gf). Thus the
object H(g,f) is precisely the one which allows one to glue together the
short exact sequences 0-->ker(f)-->ker(gf)-->ker(g) and
coker(f)-->coker(gf)-->coker(g)-->0.

   If gf=0 then H(g,f)=ker(g)/im(f) is precisely the homology object at
B, but as Ross already mentioned, this object is well defined for any
composable pair of arrows. Now, if we have three composable arrows
f:A-->B, g:B-->C, h:C-->D, then there is a  4-term exact sequence
0-->H(g,f)-->H(hg,f)-->H(h,gf)-->H(h,g)-->0. The snake lemma can be
derived from the special case hgf=0 of this 4-term exact sequence, where
g corresponds precisely to the middle vertical arrow of Michael's diagram.

It is interesting to observe that a proof (without elements !) of this
4-term exact sequence uses some nice composition properties of
Hilton-exact squares (a common generalization of pullback and pushout
squares). Some more details can be found at pg. 24 of
http://math.unice.fr/~cberger/structure1.

Several questions arise naturally: this 4-term exact sequence looks like
a "cocycle". Are there generalizations to n composable arrows ? What
about generalizations to non-abelian categories ?

All the best,
                         Clemens.
