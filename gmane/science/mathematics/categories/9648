Not quite: the affine rational line doesn't have a definable total order,
since it has order-reversing automorphisms, so any definition using
Dedekind sections is problematic. However, it does have a ternary
`betweenness' relation, and it should be possible to rewrite the
geometric theory of Dedekind sections of Q, as presented on p. 1015
of `Sketches of an Elephant', in terms of this relation (but note that
sections will have to be unordered rather than ordered pairs of
subobjects of Q).
