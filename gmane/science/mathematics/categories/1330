I would suggest doing it in tex and then converting it to pdf, which is
quickly coming to be a standard for the web.  There are at least two ways
of doing tex --> pdf that cost no money.  (You can also get Adobe
distiller, but that costs actual money.)  There is something called
pdflatex, that I have not used but it comes free with the tex distribution
from CTAN (it is essentially undocumented, so if you figure it out, I
would like to know about how it works.  A second, not entirely
satisfactory is to use the ability of gsview to output pdf files.  You
choose print to disk and then you get a pdf file that can be read with the
Adobe reader.  It is common practice to put a link to the free download of
the Adobe reader when you post a pdf file, but most users of the web
probably have it by now.
