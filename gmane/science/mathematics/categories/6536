Dear Colleagues,
  =20
This is the Final Call for Papers for MFPS 27. The deadline for =
submitting titles and short abstracts in next Monday, February 21, and =
the deadline for full papers is the following Monday, February 28. Below =
are the details:

             FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS
                         MFPS XXVII
     http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/MFPS27

         Twenty-seventh Conference on the
           Mathematical Foundations of
              Programming Semantics

           Carnegie Mellon University
         Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA
              25 May - 28 May 2011

The Twenty-seventh Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of =
Programming Semantics will take place on the campus of Carnegie Mellon =
University, Pittsburgh, PA from 25 May to 28 May 2011. MFPS conferences =
are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic, and computer science =
that are related to models of computation, in general, and to the =
semantics of programming languages, in particular. The series has =
particularly stressed providing a forum where researchers in mathematics =
and computer science can meet and exchange ideas about problems of =
common interest. As the series also strives to maintain breadth in its =
scope, the conference strongly encourages participation by researchers =
in neighbouring areas.

TOPICS include, but are not limited to, the following: biocomputation; =
concurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed systems; process =
calculi; probabilistic systems; constructive mathematics; domain theory =
and categorical models; formal languages; formal methods; game =
semantics; lambda calculus; programming-language theory; quantum =
computation; security; topological models; logic; type systems; type =
theory. We also welcome contributions that address applications of =
semantics to novel areas such as complex systems, markets, and networks, =
for example.

INVITED SPEAKERS:

Stephen Brookes, CMU
J=E9r=F4me Feret, INRIA
John Reynolds, CMU
Alex Simpson, Edinburgh
Stephanie Weirich, Penn
Steve Zdancewic, Penn

SPECIAL SESSIONS:

* A Special Session Honoring John Reynolds on his 75th birthday, =
organised by Stephen Brookes (CMU) and Peter O=92Hearn (QMW, London).

* A Special Session on Systems Biology, held in conjunction J=E9r=F4me =
Feret=92s plenary talk, and organised by Jean Krivine (Paris VII & =
CNRS).

* A Special Session on Security, held in conjunction with Steve =
Zdancewic=92s plenary talk, and organised by Catherine Meadows (NRL).

TUTORIALS: There will be four tutorials on Programs from Proofs that =
will be given during the course of the meeting. The lectures are =
organised by Martin Escard=F3 and Achim Jung (Birmingham). The speakers =
include Ulrich Berger (Swansea), Martin Escard=F3 (Birmingham), Paulo =
Oliva (Queen Mary), and Monika Seisenberger (Swansea).
