Dear David,

The only maps from X^2 to X that are guaranteed to exist in any
category with products are the two projection maps. Indeed, if
you consider the category opposite to finite sets, where the
square of the one-element set 1 is the two-element set 2, there
are precisely two maps 2 --> 1. (This is in some sense a
universal example, as this category is equivalent to the initial
Lawvere algebraic theory.)

The question makes better sense in the context of 2-categories
with 2-products, where a right adjoint to a diagonal map, if one
exists, can rightfully be called a "product". This gives what you
are after when applied to the 2-category Cat. One also finds this
sort of thing in the context of cartesian bicategories, for example.

Best wishes,

Todd
