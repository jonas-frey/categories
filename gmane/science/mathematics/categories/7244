Call for Participation
6th Scottish Category Theory Seminar
2pm, Friday 25 May
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D


Category theory is a relatively new branch of mathematics which seeks to
understand abstract mathematical structure. At its core, category theory
contains a synthesis of algebraic, logical and geometric intuitions. This
allows for both diverse applications and innovative insights in areas
including pure mathematics, computer science, physics etc. The Scottish
Category Theory Seminar provides a forum for discussion of all aspects of
category, be they straight category theory or applications to other
scientific fields.

Our sixth meeting takes place on Friday 25 May 2012 and is focussed on th=
e
exciting developments that have taken place recently in Higher Dimensiona=
l
Category Theory and its applications in homotopy theory and type theory.
We intend the meeting to be attractive to mathematicians, computer
scientists, physicists etc., and thus have aimed for talks which will be
of interest to a broad audience of people who are curious about the lates=
t
developments in Higher Dimensional Category Theory.

Speakers
Thomas Streicher (University of Darmstadt),
        On Univalent Foundations

Ondrej Rypacek (Kings College, London),
        A syntactical approach to weak omega-groupoids

Simona Paoli (University of Leicester)
    	n-typical n-fold groupoids

Eric Finster (Ecole Polytechnique De Lausanne),
        Revising the Opetopes: Applications in Computer Science and Type
Theory

The meeting will take place at the Department of Computer and Information
Sciences of the University of Strathclyde (Room 14.15, Livingston Tower,
26 Richmond Street, Glasgow). Refreshments will be available from 1pm and
the talks start at 2pm. More details can be found at

                personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~ng/SCT/sct250512.html

The meeting will be followed by drinks in a nearby pub (from 17.30) and
then dinner at a local restaurant (from 18.30). You are politely requeste=
d
to contact us (email scotcats@cis.strath.ac.uk) by Friday 11 May if you
are intending to attend the meeting and/or
if you are intending to come to dinner  so we can cater appropriately.

The meeting has been sponsored by SICSA.
