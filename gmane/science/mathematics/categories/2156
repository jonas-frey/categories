I hope Jaap and Peter will forgive me for saying that I think they
missed the point of my message. (Perhaps it's my fault -- with hindsight,
I wasn't as clear as I should have been. I really ought to stop trying
to reply to things like this late at night -- although, as you'll see
from the header of this message, I'm doing it again.)

Of course I know about the Hyland--Ong paper: indeed, I reviewed it for
Zentralblatt. However, the point I was trying to make was that the
construction of the quasitopos of A-valued assemblies, and the proof
that its effectivization is a topos, make no use whatever of the
condition that Sxy is always defined. The fact that the tautology
((p => (q => r)) => ((p => q) => (p => r))) fails (or may fail) to
be realized by S when p is empty has no effect on this construction,
because one never has to deal with "propositions" having an empty
set of realizers. So, whilst a tripos-theorist (if such a creature
exists) may indeed have cause to worry about whether Sxy might be
undefined, there seems to be no reason why a topos-theorist should do so.

[Yes, yes, I know that I was responsible for inventing the term
"tripos", and therefore that if anyone can legitimately be called a
tripos-theorist then I can. But I don't believe that I am a
tripos-theorist (which implies that no-one is).]
