A pasting presentation for an omega-category is similar to a presentation
for a group, but taking into account that there are cells of different
dimensions. In particular, generators in dimension n are ``labeled''
n-dimensional pasting schemes with the labeling involving generators
*and relations* in lower dimensions. More details about pasting presentations
can be found in my paper "Pasting presentations for omega-categories", which
is available via my web-page: http://www.mpce.mq.edu.au/~scrans/papers/
or via hypatia: http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/author/C/CransSE/.

The proposition above follows by general categorical methods, using the
adjunction between omega-categories and cubical sets. Apart from my proof
cited above there are earlier proofs by Al-Agl and Steiner [Nerves of
multiple categories, Proc. London Math. Soc. (3) 66 (1993) 92-128] and
by Brown and Higgins [Tensor products and homotopies for omega-groupoids
and crossed complexes] (who only do omega-groupoids but their proof holds
for omega-categories as well).

Yes, there are elements in C TENS D corresponding to f TENS h and g TENS k.
But is not just that (f TENS h) o_p (g TENS k) = (f o_p g) TENS (h o_p k)
is not true: it does not even make sense, because the sources and targets
don't match up.
