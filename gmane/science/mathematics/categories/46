Whose reals, Cauchy's or Dedekind's?     If the latter then that's no
surprise---carrying out constructions with open order filters is less
constructive than with the Cauchy sequence concept.  Lubarsky and
Rathien in Logic and Analysis 1:2 131-152 have recently made the point
that whereas Cauchy reals can be understood constructively as a set, any
attempt to make Dedekind's reals constructive turns them into a proper
class.

Between Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences, the more appropriate notion
of reals for constructive analysis would surely be the Cauchy reals.
Are these constructively different from the binary reals?  And if so, is
there any intuition underlying that difference that is as clear-cut as
the difference between either and the Dedekind reals?

Let's compare apples with apples here.  There are presumably going to be
nonconstant *functions* from the Freyd coalgebra object to 2 in this
topos, although they won't be continuous with respect to the topology
induced on that object by its coalgebra structure.  But neither will the
nonconstant functions from N^N to N be continuous with respect to the
order interval topology on N^N lexicographically ordered.  So I don't
see any progress here towards distinguishing the order type of the Freyd
coalgebra from the lexicographic order on N^N, in this topos or any other.
