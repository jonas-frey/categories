Dear Ronnie,

This is about your remarks:

 > inverse semigroups are closely related to pseudogroups and so are
part of Charles Ehresmann local-to-global view
 > Is this a rash view that one should look more at inverse categories?

I worked on two subjects where inverse categories are important,
homological algebra and a categorical approach to manifolds - this
second point, of course, agrees with the first citation above, from
your posting.

1. While studying universal models of spectral sequences, in the
70's-80s, I studied inverse categories, as well as a more general
notion, orthodox categories (the analogue of orthodox semigroups, ie
regular semigroups where idempotents are closed under multiplication).

The link comes from the fact that the main theories which produce
spectral sequences (the filtered complex, the double complex,
Massey's exact couple) are 'distributive', in the sense that their
classifying Puppe-exact category E has distributive lattices of
subobjects (notice that this aspect would be lost if one uses the
classifying *abelian* category, since the existence of products
clashes with distributivity). Now, the distributivity of E is
equivalent to the fact that the (involutive) category of relations of
E is orthodox (i.e., idempotent endorelations are closed under
composition), and also to the fact that canonical isomorphisms
between subquotients in E are closed under composition (a crucial
fact when working in homological algebra). Moreover, as an orthodox
category, RelE has a canonical quotient which is an inverse category;
in the latter, the study of subquotients of E is easier. (Notice that
subquotients in E amount to subobjects in RelE, as well as in its
inverse quotient. The first fact was already used in Mac Lane's
'Homology' to define induced homomorphisms; in an abelian context, of
course.)
All this is developed in various papers, but a synopsis can be found
in [1]. Paper [2] shows that every small inverse category can be
embedded in the standard example of inverse categories: sets and
partial bijections (ie, bijections between subsets of domain and
codomain, composed as relations).

2. Inverse categories are of interest when viewing manifolds as
enriched categories, in the line of the well-known Lawvere's paper on
metric spaces. More generally, the procedure works for 'glueing
structures', defined by glueing elementary ones: manifolds, fibre
bundles, foliations...

Here, the basic inverse category for manifolds is the category C of
open subspaces of all euclidean spaces, with partial homeomorphisms
(or diffeomorphisms) between open subsets of domain and codomain. A
manifold is then defined replacing the usual atlas of charts U_i -->
R^n with the 'glueing atlas' of such partial bijections U_i --> U_j.
This atlas is, in a sense to be made precise, a category enriched
over C - as an involutive ordered category endowed with further
structure. The underlying topological space is recovered as a lax
colimit. See [3, 4].
