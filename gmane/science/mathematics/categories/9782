Hi,

    the reference you are searching comes under the title "adjoint
triangle theorem" which is due to Eduardo Dubuc (cf. the nLab entry).
The left adjoint f_* is uniquely determined by the fact that M_T and
M_T' are "nice" monads. The explicit (known) formulas for this left
adjoint imply your observation.

    All the best,
                   Clemens.
