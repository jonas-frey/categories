          --- Call for Papers ---

7th Workshop on Intuitionistic Modal Logic and Applications
https://sites.google.com/site/imla2017toulouse/
<https://sites.google.com/site/imodallogic2013/>

Affiliated with the 29th European Summer School in Logic, Language, and
Information (ESSLLI2017), University of Toulouse (France), 17-28 July, 2017

Constructive modal logics and type theories are of increasing foundational
and practical relevance in computer science. Applications of constructive
modal logics  in type disciplines for programming languages, meta-logics
for reasoning about a variety of computational phenomena and explanatory
frameworks in philosophical logic are everywhere.

The workshop aims at developing and explaining theoretical and
methodological issues around the question of how the proof-theoretic
strengths of constructive logics can best be combined with the
model-theoretic strengths of modal logics. Practical issues center around
the question of which modal connectives with associated laws or proof rules
capture computational phenomena accurately and at the right level of
abstraction.

In its seventh edition, the Workshop on Intuitionistic Modal Logic and
Applications will take  place in Toulouse France, in conjunction with the 29th
ESSLLI <https://www.irit.fr/esslli2017/>.

Topics of interest to this forum include, but are not limited to:

* Modal Logics
* Logical frameworks
* Proof theory
* Type theory
* Automated deduction
* Formal semantics of languages and systems
* Applications

IMLA 2017 also aims to be a forum for presenting and discussing work
in progress, and therefore to provide feedback to authors on their
preliminary research.

*Submissions*

Contributions should be written in English and submitted in the form
of full papers (with a maximum of 12 pages) or short papers (with
a maximum of 6 pages). They must be unpublished and not submitted
simultaneously for publication elsewhere. The papers should be prepared
in latex using EPTCS style. The submission should be in the form of a
PDF file uploaded to IMLA 2017 page at Easychair

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=imla2017

until the submission deadline in March 1st, 2017, anywhere on Earth.

At least one of the authors should register for the conference.

The paper presentation should be in English.

*Important Dates*

Paper submission deadline: March 1st, 2017
Author notification: April 15th, 2017
Contribution for Proceedings: 15 May 2017
Final program [and Proceedings]:   1 June 2017
