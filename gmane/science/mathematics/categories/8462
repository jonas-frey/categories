10th Workshop on Games for Logic and Programming Languages (GaLoP 2015)

London, United Kingdom, 11-12 April

http://www.gamesemantics.org

GaLoP is an annual international workshop on game-semantic models for
logics and programming languages and their applications. This is an
informal workshop that welcomes work in progress, overviews of more
extensive work, programmatic or position papers and tutorials.

GaLoP X will be held in London, UK on 11-12 April 2015 as a satellite
workshop of ETAPS (http://www.etaps.org/).

Areas of interest include:
    * Games and other interaction-based denotational models;
    * Games-based program analysis and verification;
    * Logics for games and games for logics;
    * Algorithmic aspects of game semantics;
    * Categorical aspects of game semantics;
    * Programming languages and full abstraction;
    * Higher-order automata and Petri nets;
    * Geometry of interaction;
    * Ludics;
    * Epistemic game theory;
    * Logics of dependence and independence;
    * Computational linguistics;
    * Games and multi-valued logics.

There will be no formal proceedings but the possibility of a special
issue in a journal will be considered (the 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014
workshops led to special issues in Annals of Pure and Applied Logic).

// Submission Instructions //

Please submit an abstract (up to one page) of your proposed talk on the
