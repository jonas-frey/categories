Thanks for your reply but I am mystified by this statement in SGA4.?? It
appears to me Fonct(C,U-Ens) does satisfy both (C1) and (C2), so I must
be missing something.?? Here is my proof; please would you point out
where I'm going wrong?

Firstly: C is in U, so ob C and every object, every homset and every
morphism of C are in U, by transitivity of U.

For (C1), we must show that any functor F from C to U-Ens is in U.?? Any
such F is an ordered pair (ob F, mor F).??

- ob F is a set of ordered pairs (c,x) where c is a C-object and x is in
U. Such an ordered pair is in U.?? So ob F is a subset of U and its
cardinality is that of ob C so ob F is in U (Proposition 7 in the
Appendix of SGA4, p98).

- mor F is a set of triples (c,d,p) where c and d are C-objects and p is
a map from C(c,d) to Fc->Fd hence a subset of C(c,d) * (Fc -> Fd).?? And
Fc and Fd are in U, so Fc -> Fd is too by the Corollary to Proposition 6
(on p98).?? So C(c,d) * (Fc -> Fd) is in U, so p is in U, so (c,d,p) is
in U.?? So mor F is a subset of U, and its cardinality is that of (ob
C)*(ob C) which is in U.?? By Proposition 7, mor F is in U.

In conclusion F = (ob F, mor F) is in U.

For (C2), let F and G be functors from C to U-Ens.?? The set of natural
transformations F -> G is a subset of Prod_{c in ob C} (Fc --> Gc).?? For
any c in C, we know that Fc and Gc are in U, so Fc -> Gc is in U.?? So by
the Corollary to Proposition 6, Prod_{c in ob C} (Fc -> Gc) is in U, so
the set of natural transformations F -> G is in U.??

Best regards,
Paul
