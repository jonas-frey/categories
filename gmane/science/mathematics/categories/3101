The situation is more complicated in that what could be classed as
speculation may get published as theorem and proof. For example,  in
algebraic topology, sometimes proofs of continuity are omitted as if this
was an exercise for the reader, yet the formulation of why the maps are
continuous (if they are necessarily so) may contain a key aspect of what
should be a complete proof. This difficulty was pointed out to me years ago
by Eldon Dyer in relation to results on local fibration implies global
fibration (for paracompact spaces) where he and Eilenberg felt Dold's paper
on this
contained the first complete proof. I have been unable to complete the proof
in Spanier's book, even the second edition. (I sent a correction to Spanier
as the key function in the first edition was not well defined, after
Spanier had replied `Isn't it continuous?')   Eldon speculated (!) that
perhaps 50% of published algebraic topology was seriously wrong!

van Kampen's original 1935 `proof' of what is called his theorem is
incomprehensible today, and maybe was then also.

Efforts to give full details of a major result, i.e. to give a proof, are
sometimes derided. Of course credit should be given to the originator of the
major steps towards a proof.

Grothendieck's efforts to develop structures and language which would reduce
proofs to a sequence of tautologies are notable here. Colin McLarty's
excellent article on `The rising sea: Grothendieck on simplicity and
generality ' is relevant.

Some scientists snear at the mathematical notion of rigour and of proof. On
the other hand many are attracted to math because it can give explanations
of why something is true. But `explanations' need a higher level of
structural language than for what might be called proofs.

I can't resist mentioning that one student questionaire on my first year
analysis wrote `Professor Brown puts in too many proofs.' So I determined to
rectify the situation, and next year there were no theorems,  and no proofs.
However there were lots of statements labelled `FACT' followed by several
paragraphs labelled `EXPLANATION'.  This did modify the course because
something labelled `explanation' ought really to explain something! I leave
you all to puzzle this out!

In homotopy theory, many matters, such as the homotopy addition lemma, had
clear proofs only years after they were well used.

Surely much early algebraic topology is speculative, in that the language
has not yet been developed to express concepts with rigour so that a clear
proof can be written down. It would be  a curious ahistorical assumption
that there is not at this date another future level of concepts which
require a similar speculative approach to reach towards them.
