			      LPAR'2000 

		   7th International Conference on
 
	    LOGIC for PROGRAMMING and AUTOMATED REASONING

		 Reunion Island, November 6-10, 2000

       
			   CALL FOR PAPERS 


Location:

LPAR'2000 will be held November 6-10, 2000, on Reunion Island, a small
french island in the Indian Ocean, to the east of Madagascar. It will
be followed by a "Workshop on Implementations of Logic", November 11-12.


Topics:

* automated reasoning               * lambda and combinatory calculi 
* interactive theorem proving       * constructive logic and type theory
* implementations of logic          * computional interpretations of logic
* design of logical frameworks      * logical foundations of programming
* program & system verification     * logical aspects of concurrency
* model checking                    * program extraction from proofs
* rewriting                         * linear logic
* logic programming                 * modal and temporal logics
* constraints programming           * knowledge representation & reasoning
* logic and databases               * reasoning about actions
* logic & computational complexity  * description logics
* specification using logics        * nonmonotonic reasoning

Both "theoretical" papers and "experimental" papers are welcome. The
first category is intended to contain new theoretical results, the
second one to describe implementations of systems, to report experiments
with implemented systems, or to compare implemented systems.
