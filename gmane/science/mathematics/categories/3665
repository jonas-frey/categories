Greetings!

As regards Peter <P.T.Johnstone@dpmms.cam.ac.uk> Johnstone's query, =

 =

> ... does anyone out there know who invented the
> terms "pullback" and "pushout"? ...,

while I can't speak directly to the question of who invented those =

terms, I do recall that, in the late '50s already, fiber bundles =

were being "pulled back" along maps to their base spaces. And I can =

still hear the late Serge Lang, bless his soul, intoning "pooll-back" =

and "poosh-out" in his characeristic French accent, in Columbia =

courses and seminars from the late '50s and early '60s.

So the terms were pretty well established (and pull-back, anyway, =

pretty well motivated), at least at Columbia, that early.

Cheers,

-- Fred
