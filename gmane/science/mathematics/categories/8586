Yes - Fred - that's correct, the question is about the algebras of the doub=
le power locale triple (so, over locales and not set). However - Michael - =
if somehow the example on p72 is applicable in this case (I cannot see how =
it can be), do please let me know, as I would be very pleased if the questi=
on is settled. =


Thanks, Christopher  =

If I had thought Richard's monad was on the category of sets, I'd have answ=

But Richard writes of his monad as being "on the category of locales", and =
there I'm not so sure ... .
