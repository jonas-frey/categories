Another, and quite successful, example is the Journal of High Energy  
Physics (http://jhep.sissa.it), an on-line journal which I have  
worked for at its beginnings, many years ago (back in 1997).
Papers can be submitted by indicating an arXiv number, or by  
uploading a (PDF, LaTeX...) file.
The editorial procedure is fully automatized, in the sense that it is  
fully operated on the web site, with minimal human intervention. This  
allows to reduce maintenance costs, and to speed up the publishing  
process of one magnitude (the average time from submission to  
publishing is something less than 2 months, which is mostly due to  
the referees). Once, accepted papers were freely available online  
from JHEP site; nowadays, these are available online through IOP's  
Electronic Journals service; but I guess that papers are still  
available for free (at least for some time), or at a reasonable price.

Ten years ago, JHEP was started by an academic consortium as a  
spontaneous answer to the (already!) outrageously increasing prices  
of the main journals in the HEP field, especially Nuclear Physics B  
(which is run by Elsevier, and costs more than 15200 euros/year... so  
Vico was right, after all.) Nowadays, JHEP has become one of the  
major journals in the field: for instance, Ed Witten, Ashoke Sen and  
Cumrun Vafa regularly publish papers on JHEP.
For what it is worth, in 2005 the JHEP Impact Factor was 5.944, that  
of Nuclear Physics B was 5.522.  So on-line journals can compete with  
"standard" journals also on this point.

As far as the "real existence" of online papers, especially for grant  
applications, career advancements, etc: if I remember correctly, from  
a formal point of view the only important thing is that to have an  
ISSN number - which means that the journal is officially recognized  
as a periodical publication. The existence of a "printed version" to  
store and forget in dusty (and increasingly deserted) libraries is  
not needed.
