Hi Jean-Pierre:

Your statement of the disjointness condition puzzled me a little,
because it would seem to rule out the composition of morphisms
X-->X-->X, but Mac Lane makes it clear that the case (X,Y) = (U,V) is an
exception.

That said, I don't interpret the disjointness axiom as an axiom for
composition, but for hom-sets. If

                   f  ??  hom(X,Y) ??? hom(U,V),  X???U or Y???V,

then domain and/or codomain are not functions or don't play well with
hom(-,-) . This would be counterintuitive even in a directed multigraph;
composition doesn't come into it.

Bob Par??, Dorette Pronk, and I have discussed a definition of
composition for which codomain-domain matching is not required. We're
primarily interested in the higher category case; the ordinary category
case seems straightforward but unexciting. The idea is that the
composition of f:X-->Y and g:U-->V should be an equivalence class of
hom(X,Y) x hom(U,V) that has well-defined compositions  with other
arrows /in a certain syntax. /That last is important: we don't define
"the composition of the set {f,g}" without reference to order, even
where both are well defined.Here, given f,f':X-->Y and g,g':U-->V, the
operation acts as a placeholder for a "test" morphism in the gap.

                    f*g = f'*g' if fkg =f'kg' for all k:Y-->U.

(Nontrivial example: in the category of groups, f*g = -f*-g. )

Hope this helps,

Robert





, just as ordinary composition depends on syntax (ie, order), this
generalized composition would
