One of my favorite quotes:

The question you raise ``how can such a formulation lead to
computations'' doesn't bother me in the least! Throughout my whole life
as a mathematician, the possibility of making explicit, elegant
computations has always come out by itself, as a byproduct of a thorough
conceptual understanding of what was going on. Thus I never bothered
about whether what would come out would be suitable for this or that,
but just tried to understand -- and it always turned out that
understanding was all that mattered.

A. Grothendieck


Raoul Bott reinforced this in a talk I had the privilige to hear back in
98.  He said that mathematics, done well, never required the placing of
your oar in the water (he probably put it better than that...).  The
idea I think is that if you continually ask and answer the questions
that occur to you, and, thus, gain understanding, then you will
inevitably make progress. And that is what matters, really.  So often
the person credited with solving a 'famous' problem only takes the final
step in a hard journey of a thousand miles made by a thousand others.

Glory and fame - such as it is in the world of mathematics - are nice,
but they are not, in the end,  mathematics.  I think it is of high
importance to avoid confusing them.
