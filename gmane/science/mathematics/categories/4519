An obituary notice for Henri Cartan just came my way.
It seemed appropriate to share portions of it here.

Sadly,

=2E.. Henri Cartan (1904-2008)

The world has lost one of the greatest scientists of the twentieth
century. Henri Cartan, a legendary figure in mathematics, died in
Paris on 13 August, at the age of 104 years.

The son of the great mathematician Elie Cartan, his contributions to
mathematics were fundamental, from several complex variables to
algebraic topology and homological algebra. A member of the Bourbaki
group, his participation in the rejuvenation of the French
mathematical school was essential, in particular through his seminar
held at the =C9cole Normale Sup=E9rieure. His roles as teacher and mentor=

were also exceptional, and were felt well beyond national boundaries.
