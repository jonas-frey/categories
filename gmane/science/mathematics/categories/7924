Dear list members,

I am currently working in categorical logic with something that might be ca=
lled a "compact closed deductive system", that is, a deductive system (in t=
he sense of Lambek) defined as a compact closed category (i.e., a *-autonom=
ous category where the tensor unit is a dualizing object).

I have two questions.

First, it appeared to me that we can show in a compact closed deductive sys=
tem that every arrow is an isomorphism. Hence, if there is a deduction arro=
w from A to B, then A is isomorphic (logically equivalent) to B. Is this re=
sult accurate? Does this generalize to any compact closed category?

Secondly, I wonder what happens if we add an arbitrary arrow A --> B to the=
  category. Put differently, what happens if we add A --> B as an axiom to a=
  compact closed deductive system? Does this also yield an isomorphism betwe=
en A and B (assuming that the first result is adequate)? Or is it possible =
to add some axioms that are not necessarily isomorphisms?

I hope my question is clear, and if not I would be happy to clarify myself,=
  so do not hesitate to contact me.=20

Any lead will be appreciated.

Thanks in advance for those who will respond.

Yours,
