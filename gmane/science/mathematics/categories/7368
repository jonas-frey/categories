Dear Ondrej,

Power and Robinson state in [1, Section 2] that the tensor you
describe is indeed part of a monoidal closed structure: the function
category has as objects all functors, and as morphisms the (not
necessarily natural) transformations. Moreover, Power and Robinson
state that this is the unique other symmetric monoidal closed
structure on Cat, i.e., there are no others besides this one and the
"usual" one. I have never seen a proof of this last fact.

[1] J. Power and E. Robinson. "Premonoidal categories and notions of
computation." Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 7(5):
445-452, 1997. (www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~edmundr/pubs/mscs97/premoncat.ps)
