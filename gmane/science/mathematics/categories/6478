OSEMA 2011 Call for Papers

1st International Workshop on Ontology and Semantic web for
Manufacturing  (OSEMA 2011)
http://www.osema.org.ve/
at the 8th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2011)
http://www.eswc2011.org
May 29th or 30th, Hersonissos, Crete, Greece

SUBMISSION DEADLINE February 25

The necessity of continuous innovation and improvement in productivity
presents the manufacturing industry with huge challenges. Not only is
there a demand for more creative designs, there is also the need to
improve support for streaming designs into production lines. Delivering
products to the market involves the flow of information between several
steps ranging from design to prototyping, manufacturing and
distributing.  Interoperability across software supporting these
activities is notoriously limited.

A semantic layer in the manufacturing sector may facilitate scenarios
such as the development of new products considering restrictions and
limitations of the manufacturing facility on the one hand and on the
other hand considering customer needs. Here, the design of  new the
product is instantiated into a product ontology. This ontology has
metadata including features related to materials, colors, dimensions,
etc. Such features reflect customer preferences, but imply the necessity
of processes to acquire and manage them. In a second step into this
scenario, the ontology of the manufacturing process can be instantiated
by extracting features from the product ontology, thus enabling e.g. the
automatic inference of manufacturability of the product.

In this vein, ontologies and the Semantic Web facilitate the creation of
such metadata and enable reasoning over product and process restriction.
Although several approaches of this kind have been proposed, none of
them are widely accepted so far, which means that there are still
several issues requiring extensive discussion and consensus in the
community. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a discussion scenario
where theoretical positions, best practices, implementations, proposals
of standards, and frameworks are presented. It will deserve special
interest to discuss how the manufacturing industry can take advantage of
Semantic Web technologies. OSEMA 2011 aims to provide such scenario.



QUESTIONS AND TOPICS OF INTEREST

- How can the Semantic Web support the development of new products?

- Why CAD ontologies? Do we really need them?

- Do we need one enterprise ontology, or a modular enterprise ontology?

- Can OWL be used to represent processes in the manufacturing domain?

- Knowledge management over the manufacturing =E2=80=9CKnow how=E2=80=9D.

- How can the versioning of products be managed? Can ontology help? How?

- How can raw materials be semantically described?

- Can there be an ontological framework for manufacturing so that
designs and production are interoperable?

- Semantic search over the manufacturing information space

- How can tagging techniques be applied within the manufacturing domain?


AUDIENCE

We want to bring together researchers and practitioners active in the
design, development, and application of ontologies and the Semantic Web
in the manufacturing domain, as well as industrial representatives in
Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP), and
Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) industry who are interested in
integrating the Product Life Cycle management into their software tools.
