CALL FOR PAPERS
4th Annual Workshop on String Diagrams in
Computation, Logic, and Physics
(STRINGS 2020)

https://compose.ioc.ee/strings2020/

Satellite workshop of STAF 2020

Bergen, Norway, 23 June 2020
=============================================

String diagrams are a powerful tool for reasoning about processes and
composition. Originally developed as a convenient notation for the
arrows of monoidal and higher categories, they are increasingly used in
the formal study of digital circuits, control theory, concurrency,
programming languages, quantum and classical computation, natural language,
logic and more. String diagrams combine the advantages of formal syntax
with intuitive aspects: the graphical nature of terms means that they
often reflect the topology of systems under consideration. Moreover,
diagrammatic reasoning transforms formal arguments into dynamic, moving
images, thus building domain specific intuitions, valuable both for
practitioners and pedagogy.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers from diverse
backgrounds and specialities to collaborate and share their insights,
tools, and techniques. STRINGS 2020 is a satellite event of STAF 2020,
colocated with a number of related events, including Diagrammatic and
Algebraic Methods for Business (DAMB) and the International Conference
on Graph Transformation (ICGT).

This is the fourth edition of the workshop. The first was held
in Oxford in 2017, the second as a Shonan workshop in 2018, the third
in Birmingham in 2019.
