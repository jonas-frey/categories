         **** Final Call For Participation ****

	Foundational Methods in Computer Science:
	A workshop on applications of categories
                  in computer science

                    May 29--31, 1998

                      Reed College, 
                    Portland, Oregon

     Sponsored by the Computer Science and Engineering 
Department at Oregon Graduate Institute of Science & Technology,
       the Department of Mathematics at Reed College
            and the National Science Foundation

The workshop is an informal meeting to bring together researchers in
mathematics and computer science with a focus on the application of
category theory in computer science.  It is a three day meeting that
starts off with a day of tutorials aimed at students, educators, and
newcomers to category theory, followed by a day and a half of research
talks.  All sessions will be held on the Reed campus which is quiet,
beautifully landscaped, and adjacent to a park and a public golf course.

Guest speakers at this year's workshop include:
    David Espinosa (Kestrel Institute)
    Richard Jullig (Arrow Logics)
    Eugenio Moggi (University of Genova)
    Philip Wadler (Lucent)

The remaining research talks are solicited from the participants.
At this point, however, only a few slots remain available, so if
you are interested in giving a talk, please register soon.

Student participation is particularly encouraged at FMCS.  We are
expecting a grant from the NSF, which will provide some support for
students to attend the workshop.  Support is offered on a first-come,
first-served basis.  Please inquire if you are interested.

The meeting registration fee is $105, the student rate is $70.  This fee
includes Reception on Thursday, 3 meals on Friday, 3 meals on Saturday
(which includes a banquet dinner), 2 meals on Sunday, and proceedings
of the meeting.  The lodging fee is $80, which covers 3 nights lodging
($25/night) and Linen Fee ($5.00) at Reed College.  Payment will be
accepted prior to the meeting by check, and payments must be received
by April 14, 1998.

Please visit the FMCS98 web site for further details.
