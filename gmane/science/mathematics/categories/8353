Scope
---------
Studying logics via semantics is a well-established and very active
branch of mathematical logic, with many applications, in computer
science and elsewhere. The area is characterised by results, tools and
techniques stemming from various fields, including universal algebra,
topology, category theory, order, and model theory. The programme of
the conference TACL 2015 will focus on three interconnecting
mathematical themes central to the semantic study of logics and their
applications: algebraic, categorical, and topological methods. This is
the seventh conference in the series Topology, Algebra, and Categories
in Logic (TACL). Earlier instalments of this conference have been
organised in Tbilisi (2003), Barcelona (2005), Oxford (2007),
Amsterdam (2009), Marseilles (2011), and Nashville (2013).
Starting from 2013, the conference is preceded by a one-week school.
This year the school will be held at the campus of the University of
Salerno and will include four tutorials, each consisting of 1.5 hour
lectures for five days.

Featured topics
---------------------
Contributed talks can be on any topic involving the use of algebraic,
categorical or topological methods in either logic or computer
science. This includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:

* Algebraic structures in CS
* Algebraic logic
* Coalgebra
* Categorical methods in logic
* Domain theory
* Lattice theory
* Lattices with operators
* Many-valued and fuzzy logics
