		   CALL FOR TALKS AND PARTICIPATION

              Workshop on Structure Preserving Relations



Relations are ubiquitous in Computer Science.  In particular, those
which preserve structure are of central interest, appearing in the
form of logical relations and bisimulation, and used to study
abstraction and data and program refinement, for example.

The workshop is intended to bring researchers on these topics together
to present and compare their various approaches, and to allow
potential users of these techniques to see which if any of these
structures may be of use in their own more applied research.

The workshop will be held at ETL/AIST in Amagasaki, which is a scenic
coastal town near Kobe, with easy rail connections to the famous
tourist sites of Kyoto and Nara. The meeting will commence at 2:00 pm
on Monday, March 12, 2001, finishing sometime after lunch on
Wednesday, March 14.

Being supported by the COE project 'Global Informatics' funded by STA,
the workshop is a successor to the Workshop on Refinement and
Abstraction held at the same city in November, 1999 (see
http://www.etl.go.jp/~yoshiki/WRA/ for more information about this).

TALKS AND THE PROCEEDINGS:

      We wish to keep the informal atmosphere of the previous workshop
      making it easier to go for fruitful discussions.  All
      participants are welcome to give a talk on relations which
      preserve some mathematical structure such as algebraic
      structure.  We do not collect papers from the speakers in
      advance of the workshop.  Rather, we will bundle a
      post-proceedings of the workshop, which we plan to publish in a
      volume of Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.  To
      this post-proceedings, not only the speakers but all
      participants will be invited to submit papers about topics
      related to the workshop.

ACCOMMODATION:

      Hotel New Archaic, which is in reasonable distance from the
      workshop place, offers a following rate to participants of this
      workshop:

      Single room : 7,507 Yen(including SVC,TAX)
      Twin room : 12,705 Yen(including SVC,TAX)
