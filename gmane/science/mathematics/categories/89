Pretty much.  Peter was speaking of day \omega.  With your
identification applied to that day, the only other step needed is to
remove \omega and -\omega and then you have exactly the field R.

A more uniform way of arriving at R is to take the subset consisting of
those numbers expressible as a nonempty proper sup or nonempty proper
inf in an even number of ways.  This is because at day \omega you have
\omega, -\omega, D \cdot 3 in the sense of ordinal product, where D is
the set of dyadic rationals and 3 = {-1/omega < 0 < 1/omega} (the range
of adjustments to each dyadic rational), and the dyadic irrationals.
\omega is a proper sup of the integers but not a nonempty inf (though it
is the empty inf), and dually for -\omega.  The dyadic rationals are not
a proper sup or inf of anything (their increments on either side prevent
this) but the increment on the left is a proper sup but not a proper
inf, and dually on the right.  The dyadic irrationals are both a proper
sup of what's below them and a proper inf of what's above them.

Puzzle.  Bearing in mind that on all days prior to day \omega, every
number satisfies this criterion, on what other days besides day \omega
does this criterion produce a field?
