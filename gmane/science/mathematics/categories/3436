Of course -- (cocomplete) quasitoposes are geometric categories as well,
and they needn't be balanced. Incidentally, Gordon Monro wrote a couple
of papers about the interpretation of logic in quasitoposes, which
appeared in JPAA 42 (1986).

I've never really found a satisfactory conceptual explanation of why
these two definitions come out equivalent. Undoubtedly it's connected
with the fact that, in the recursive definition, one is thinking in
terms of interpretations in geometric categories, but is there more to it
than that?
