Fellow category theorists,

The University of Western Ontario is advertising 10 Canada Research
Chair positions for members of underrepresented minorities. The CRC
program is highly prestigious and it's a pretty sweet deal.

This is a competition across all university disciplines and we would
love to see many mathematicians apply.

The application deadline is June 19 (yes, in 2 weeks). You may not be
able to submit your strongest application, but don't worry - no-one
will have enough time to properly prepare it, so it's still worth
putting one in.

A couple of paragraphs from the ad:

To address Western=E2=80=99s commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion
[...], *only* applicants who self-identify as a woman, Indigenous
person or person with a disability will be considered for these CRC
opportunities.

For Tier 2 Chairs, candidates must be exceptional emerging world-class
researchers (i.e., candidates must have less than 10 years of
experience as an active researcher in their field at the time of
nomination) who have demonstrated particular research creativity and
have demonstrated the potential to achieve international recognition
in their fields within five to ten years.

For Tier 1 Chairs, candidates must be outstanding and innovative
world-class researchers who have made a major impact and are
recognized internationally as leaders in their fields.
