                 The 13th International Conference on
                Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics

                        Portland, Oregon, USA
               Monday 14 August - Friday 18 August 2000

               ***************************************

The 2000 International Conference on Theorem Proving in Higher Order
Logics will be the thirteenth in a series that dates back to 1988.
The conference will be held Monday 14 August through Friday 18 August,
2000, at the DoubleTree Hotel, Portland, Oregon, USA.  The first day
of the conference will be devoted to tutorials, with the remaining 4
days covering the main conference program.

TOPICS

The program committee welcomes submissions on all aspects of theorem
proving in higher order logics, and on related topics in theorem
proving and verification.  This includes, but is not limited to, the
following topics:

  o  Hardware and software verification, refinement and synthesis
  o  Verification of security and communications protocols
  o  Formal specification and requirements analysis of systems
  o  Industrial applications of theorem provers
  o  Advances in theorem prover technology
  o  Comparisons of various approaches to theorem proving
  o  Proof automation and decision procedures
  o  Incorporation of theorem provers into larger systems
  o  Combination of theorem provers with other provers and tools
  o  User interfaces for theorem provers
  o  Development and extension of higher order logics

SUBMISSION

Submissions are invited in the following categories:

 o Category A: Full research paper
 o Category B: Informal progress report

Submissions under category A will be fully refereed, and accepted papers
will be published as a volume of Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series ("http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html"),
which will be available at the conference.  Authors of accepted papers
are expected to present their work at the conference.

Submissions under category B will not be formally refereed, but their
content and relevance will be reviewed.  Those submissions accepted
will be published in a technical report, which will be available at the
conference.  Authors of accepted papers are expected to present a
brief outline of their work at the conference and to prepare a poster
for display at the conference venue.  Unless otherwise requested,
submissions rejected under category A will also be considered for
inclusion under category B.

DEADLINES AND SUBMISSION PROCEDURE

  o Deadline for category A submissions:                   25 Feb 2000
