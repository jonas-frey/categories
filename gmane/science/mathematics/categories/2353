Thank you for your quick answer.
I am not sure to understand it quite well. I must confess that I =
consider myself much more as a differential geometer than as a =
"categoricist", so that I am not at all well informed about categorical =
literature. In fact I am often considered as a dissident in both fields, =
since my general philosophy is :
-first that there is a lot of interesting things to do in Geometry using =
categories, an idea with which unfortunately most geometers, save =
Ehresmann, disagree ;
- secund that most of the classical tools developed by category =
theorists, including Ehresmann, are not the best adapted for that =
purpose, and I tried to develop some alternative tools (which indeed =
most people ignore).
It is not the place here to say more on that subject.=20
About the precise point in discussion the main object of my letter was =
to emphasize the secund aspect of the definition (functor from I x A to =
B or more symmetrically to I x B), which seems less familiar (is it =
written somewhere ?) than the first one, and in my opinion the simplest =
and the most useful (at least for my personal use). For each arrow f of =
A from a to a', the image of  I x {a, f, a'}, which may also be regarded =
as an image of I x I, gives immediately a commutative square in A and =
its diagonal (3 x 3 =3D 9 arrows including the unit ones), where one =
reads immediately all the useful aspects of the data, displayed in a =
perfectly geometric and symmetric way, in contrast with the usual =
definitions, in which the two functors and the naturality arrow seem to =
play quite unsymmetrical roles. (Of course all of this is so perfectly =
obvious that I am convinced that plenty of people have noticed this, but =
I must confess that I have never read (nor heared) it, though in my =
opinion it is the best way of describing a natural transformation.)=20
I think also than it would be often useful to consider more frequently =
the obvious canonical structure of double category on a product category =
and especially on I x A, and I x I.

  Thanks, Jean. As an assiduous student of CWM, I was aware of this and =
will always wonder why Mac Lane didn't just make the point explicit in =
his first edition in 1971. The only thing left to realize is that the =
category of commutative squares which you mention is a subcategory of a =
product category and thus has a couple of projection functors on it =
which can be used to follow a functor to get the domain and codomain =
functors of the natural transformation, so that this version of =
naturality is much more neatly packaged than the usual diagram. I =
believe that there is a worker named John Baez (deep apologies for any =
naive and unforgivable errors here) who says that Mac Lane claimed to be =
interested not in functoriality so much as naturality when he was =
coinventing category theory; I wonder when and if he realized that =
naturality is a brand of functoriality. It would seem that this =
realization would come very early. In general, if one fixes an argument =
in a bifunctor, the resulting function is a fully extended intertwining =
function, and I believe that your point is that every natural =
transformation arises in this way. So already naturality is an artifact =
of functoriality. Mitchell notices much of this in his 1965 book.=20
