Does the concept of "filtered monad" exist in the literature?


I don't know, but your concept does indeed seem to come up a lot...

I'm tempted to formalize it a bit.  Let's look at an example:

It seems that *one* aspect of what you've got here is a lax monoidal functor
from the multiplicative monoid of natural numbers to End(C).   Such a thing
consists of a functor

F_n: C -> C

for each natural number n, together with natural transformations

F_m o F_n => F_{mn}

and

1_C => F_1

satisfying appropriate coherence laws.

(For example, you can build two natural transformations from F_m o F_n o F_k
to F_{mnk}, but they're equal.)

But there's more: you also have natural transformations

F_m => F_n

whenever m is less than or equal to n.  And this seems to be an important
aspect of the intuition that's making you use the word "filtered".   So,
instead of treating the natural numbers as a mere monoid, I think you are
treating them as a monoidal poset.

In other words: there's a monoidal category M with natural numbers as
objects, a single morphism m -> n whenever m is less than or equal to n, and
multiplication as tensor product.  And, I think you've got a lax monoidal
functor

F: M -> End(C)

It's possible that whenever C has colimits, you can take a pointwise colimit
of the functors F_n in this situation and get an actual monad.

But it seems your lax monoidal functor is a bit better than average: you
have F_1 = 1_C, not just a natural transformation from 1_C to F_1.

2. Let C be the category of R-modules (R a given ring), F(M) is the tensor

Here it seems you're using a different monoidal poset, coming from the
additive monoid of natural numbers with its usual ordering.

Best,
