Grothendieck introduced the term "topos" simply out of "topology" and
"topological space".

we should wonder who and why introduced "topology" and "topological space".

I think that MacLane said at one point that there was a terminological link through Rudolf Carnap, thus through neokantians. The notion of categories plays a prominent role in Kant's first Critique. But it is even more interesting if the term topos was introduced with an intentional reference to *dialectics*, which is what that part of Organon is about.
