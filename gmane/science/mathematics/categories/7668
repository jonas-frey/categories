There is something about this, yes; I read about this sort of things some
time ago, so take what follows with a grain of salt.

First, I will work with the opposite of your category, so what we have is a
category for which every span can be completed to a commutative square.
Let's call this notion "span-directed". Obviously, this looks like some
sort of generalized filteredness notion; every filtered category is
span-directed.

As defined, span-directed does not require connectedness, so this look more
like "pseudo-filtered", which according to Mac Lane CftWM was something
introduced by Verdier [SGA4I, I.2.7]. A category is pseudo-filtered iff is
a coproduct of filtered categories.

Now, in Definition 53 of [Protolocalisations of homological categories -
Borceux, Clementino, Gran, Sousa], they name a category protofiltered if it
is span-directed and connected.

So, according to all this, if one was to follow the same pattern,
span-directed should be named "pseudo-protofiltered" :)

I think it would be possible to have a conceptual characterization of
span-directed/pseudo-protofiltered categories, in terms of distributivity
of colimits in SET indexed by them over some natural class of limits. That
is, as D-filtered categories for D a "doctrine of D-limits" in the
terminology of [A classification of accessible categories - Ad=C3=A1mek,
Borceux, Lack, Rosick=C3=BD].

There, for a small class of categories D a category I is said to be
D-filtered if colimits indexed by I distribute over D-limits (any diagram
indexed by a category in D) in SET. Then, you get that

1. If D =3D finite categories, D-filtered =3D filtered
2. If D =3D finite connected categories, D-filtered =3D pseudo-filtered
3. If D =3D finite discrete categories, D-filtered =3D sifted

Speculative content follows, possibly everything after this point is wrong:

Now, I think that if you take D =3D equalizers what you get could be
D-filtered =3D protofiltered, or at least something similar. Something like
this is in p30 of [Sur la commutation des limites - Foltz] , which I got
from this MathOverflow answer:
http://mathoverflow.net/questions/93262/which-colimits-commute-with-which-l=
imits-in-the-category-of-sets
.

So, maybe what we need to take for obtaining D-filtered =3D
span-directed/pseudo-protofiltered is D =3D coreflexive equalizers. As fini=
te
products and coreflexive equalizers =3D finite limits in SET, this would me=
an
that sifted + span-directed/pseudo-protofiltered =3D> filtered, thus
providing an affirmative answer to "It remains an open problem to determine
whether a sifted proto=EF=AC=81ltered category
is =EF=AC=81ltered": [Protolocalisations of homological categories]
