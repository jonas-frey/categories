Hello,

let me add some remarks to Marco Grandis' posting.

I have not yet looked at that paper, but I think the "natural" thing is
to consider equivalence relations R on a category C, which are
subcategories of CxC (i.e. closed under composition, not
necessary full; identities are in R by relexivity of R). In my
diplomarbeit "Kongruenzrelationen auf Kategorien" from 1977, I
considered that, but I was not the first one. Some years earlier
there was a paper by Jacques Mersch from Liege (Belgium), which
unfortunately appeared only in an internal publication of the
university of Liege. Moreover, I think I remember that John Isbell did
something on this subject.

The universal property is also obvious in the general situation. For
small categories, a functor with this property always exists, let's
call it a quotient functor. For large categories it my happen that the
hom-sets of the quotient become large, even if the hom-sets of the
original category are small. In general, a congruence as above is
not a kernel of a functor; the quotient functor may identify more
morphisms. In my diplomarbeit, I rediscovered an example, which
had already been found by Mersch. The quotient functors are
exactly the regular epis in CAT. But unfortunately, they are not
closed under compositon, so a quotient of a quotient of C need not
be a quotient of C.

Of course, this argument also works in the general situation.
