We were colleagues at Genoa, for a few years in 1993-96, and had a
paper together
on a matter of common interest but based on his initial idea and
intuition.
In that period, we had the pleasure of having Marta Bunge with us,
during her
sabbatical in 1993-94, as she already recalled in her message.

Then he moved back to Milano and later to Como, and I only met him at
conferences and meetings.
I regret we had no further occasions of working together.

I am shocked, as so many of his colleagues and friends.
