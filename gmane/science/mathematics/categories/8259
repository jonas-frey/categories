Dear George,

Thank you for your mail. I see that all my mathematical arguments have =
not convinced you, and that trying to add more would be useless.
I respect your opinion although I totally disagree with it.

Best regards,
Jean

apologize if what I said about "factorization" and "cartesian" was =
unclear.
>=20

factorization systems and (pre foliations + cartesian FUNCTORS). What I =
was trying to say, was only that the following two constructions are =
essentially the same (up to an isomorphism):

> (a) For a fibration C-->X every morphism f in C factors as f =3D me, =
where m is a cartesian ARROW and e is a vertical arrow (with respect to =
the given fibration).
>=20

Cassidy--Hebert--Kelly) every morphism f in C factors as f =3D me, where =
m is in M, e is in E, E is the class of all morphisms inverted by C-->X, =
and M is its orthogonal class (M can also be defined as the class of =
trivial covering morphisms in the sense of Galois theory).

its orthogonal class, also exists under certain assumptions much weaker =
