It is, of course, true that Maurer's and AST's form of replacement is
stronger than the SCHEMA of replacement because it quantifies over all
families in the topos and not just the syntactically definable ones.
The same "mistake" appears in the definition of Grothendieck universes.

Set theorist insist on formulating set theory in first order logic and
therefore must formulate replacement as a schema since they can't quantify
over families of sets (the ambient category is a logos or Heyting category
but not cartesian closed). If they decided to formulate set theory within
higher order logic they presumably would have formulated replacement
not as a schema (see Bill's remarks on Goedel and Kreisel's suggestions).

But of course there is no problem to adapt Maurer's notion of replacement
to the schema form. Nevertheless, since in the schema of replacement there
may occur free variables one has to be careful when quantifying over functions
representable by formulas in the language of set by considering all
reindexings along U^n -> 1. This is not done in McLarty's article. He
just gives a reformulation of the replacement schema WITHOUT free variables.

I presumably tried to pack too much into my mail and thus (again) forgot
about the distiction between schema and the stronger from (sorry Bill!).
My intention was to advocate the necessity of an object U of sets which
is not available in (models of) ETCS. So one cannot directly interpret the
language of set theory in a model of ETCS but has first to CONSTRUCT a model
for set theory from it. But this is only possible because models of ETCS
are wellpointed. So if one is interested in models of constructive set theory
ETCS is not particularly helpful.
