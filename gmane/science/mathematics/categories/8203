Can you say anything about what it means for "cartesian
multicategories" to "make sense" for a monad T?

There is a more general notion of generalized multicategory which
takes place in a more general bicategory (or, better, a double
category) than T-spans, and which includes cartesian multicategories
as a special case (see
http://tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/24/21/24-21abs.html for a unified
account, as well as references to a lot of prior work).  I suspect
that your "cartesian T-multicategories" are probably generalized
multicategories in this sense relative to some other monad built out
of T.
