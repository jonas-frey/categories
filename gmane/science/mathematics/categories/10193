Applications are invited for a 2-year postdoctoral fellowship in a joint =
post between the Departments of Computer Science of The University of =
Hong Kong and the University of Oxford. The successful candidate will be =
be an independent and highly motivated researcher capable of working =
productively with the two groups on topics at the intersection between =
quantum information theory, quantum gravity, and quantum field theory. =
Previous experience in at least one of these areas is required.=20

The post is partly funded with by the John Templeton Foundation through =
the project "The Quantum Information Structure of Spacetime" (qiss.fr =
<http://qiss.fr/>). The successful candidate is expected to contribute =
to the goals of this project, and to join the activities of the =
newly-established HKU-Oxford Joint Lab for Quantum Information and =
Computation, becoming a member of the Quantum Information and =
Computation Initiative <https://qift.weebly.com/> led by Giulio =
Chiribella, and of the=C2=A0Quantum=C2=A0Group =
<http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/> co-led by Bob Coecke at =
Oxford Computer Science.

The target start date of the post is in May 2020 or as soon as possible =
thereafter, although candidates will be considered also after that date =
until the post is filled. The successful candidate is expected to spend =
one year at the University of Hong Kong and oner year at the University =
of Oxford. Given the developing situation with covid-19, we will =
consider remote work arrangements while travel is restricted.   =
Candidates are invited to send a CV and a cover letter and arrange for =
at least two letters of recommendation to destiny.chen[at]cs.ox.ac.uk.=20=

Applications are particularly welcome from under-represented groups in =
Computer Science.=
