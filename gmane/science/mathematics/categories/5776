I'm glad that's enough to convince you that Michael Batanin's terminology
"monoidal = 1-braided" is inferior to Andre's "monoidal = 0-braided".

But I think "braided = doubly monoidal" is even better.  After all, a
monoidal category has one tensor product; a braided monoidal category has
two compatible tensor products, and a symmetric monoidal category has three.


But I will not lose sleep if Andre uses "k-braided" as a synonym for
"(k+1)-tuply monoidal".  I don't see it causing any confusion. I just think
it will create more +1's in various formulas.  E.g.: the classifying space
of a k-braided n-category is a (k+1)-fold loop space.

Best,
jb
