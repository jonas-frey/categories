There are some interesting general issues which arise out of this
correspondence and which could merit further discussion.

1) Having tried and trying to write some background history to a result
or theory I am aware of how much work is entailed, and the difficulty of
getting it right, so I have sympathy with those complained against. I
remember one writer's reaction to a complaint that he did not give
enough reference to past work was `it was easier to work it out myself
than to read all the relevant literature'. There is historian's ethic
here which is important but is somewhat in opposition to the hard job of
getting the mathematics correct, in the best format, and publishable.

2) On the other hand appropriate credit is important. Friends will know
that I have had my own complaints about `convenient categories for
topology' although Eilenberg growled at me once: `Why are you making
such a fuss?' Another reaction (G.W. Whitehad) was:`There is no reason
why you should not get credit for work you have done.' Credit is
important also for the balance and the future of the mathematics and is
the more so in these days of research assessment. So my sympathies are
also with Jean!

3) In such assessment there is now more importance placed on citations,
especially fairly immediate ones. The problems in this are well known,
and are illustrated by this discussion. Citations are a bit like the
shadows on the wall of Plato's cave, and are only a sparse image of
reality. Some forgetful pseudo-functor is clearly involved! There are no
agreed rules, certainly no laws; all there is some general feeling that
appropriate credit should be given, and often referees or editors have
to point out omissions, which can be due to any of: ignorance,
forgetfullness, laziness, prejudice, or moral hazard, more likely some
of the first three. On forgetfullness, there is the story of Henry
Whitehead giving  a problem to a research student, who came back 2 weeks
later with the comment:`But Henry, you solved this problem in one of
your papers!' People have  sometimes reacted  to me when I came out with
a bright idea: `Aah, at last you have seen it!' There is also the
question of how far back citations should go? in other words, how long
should be the reference list? So the current emphasis on citations in
research assessment, and the large business built on it, have a strong
element of absurdity.

4) I sometimes wonder if our career structure should not have more in
common with music, where the profession and the study involves:
performance, composition, musicology, but in all cases involves an
assessment of `musicality', as well as technique.

5) The issues Jean raises in his last email on the reasons for the study
of a subject are also very important. As Philip Hall was reported to
have remarked: `It is important to study the algebra  which arises from
the geometry, rather than to force the geometry into a standard and
known mould.'

6) I do agree it is important for people to speak out on important past
trends and influences, and so to show what were the intuitions which
inspired an area of work. Not all the aims may have been achieved! I
agree that changes of published, cited and accepted terminology has its
dangers as have been pointed out by Jean in previous correspondence,
with respect to cartesian and cocartesian morphisms. The problem is
still that language does and should evolve.
