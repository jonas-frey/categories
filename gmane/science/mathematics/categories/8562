The previous suggestion of considering functors to D + 1 was a false start =
for reasons Fred and Uwe pointed out, but it suggests a better approach:  c=
onsider functors to the category D~ formed from D by freely adjoining a zer=
o object.  Arrows not in S now have somewhere to go (the zero arrow with th=
e appropriate source and target).=0A=
=0A=
I think at the one-categorical level, taking Hom(C,D) to be the zero-preser=
ving functors from C~ to D~, and letting C and D range over all small categ=
ories gives  a category isomorphic to that of small categories with partial=
  functors as arrows.=0A=
=0A=
Natural transformations between (zero-preserving) functors from C~ to D~ wo=
uld=0A=
then give a reasonable notion of partial natural transformations.  It certa=
inly captures some, at least, of the natural transformations "more partial"=
  than their source functor, since there will be a zero natural transformati=
on between any two partial functors, corresponding to a "defined nowhere" p=
artial natural transformation when zero-ness is interpreted as undefined as=
  it was in the correspondence between zero-preserving functors from C~ to D=
~ and partial functors from C to D.=0A=
=0A=
I'm not sure how this fits with the restrictions Robin points out.  It seem=
s to allow more partial natural transformations than Robin's observation, s=
ince zero arrows can fill in whenever the image object under either the sou=
rce or target functor is undefined, a partial natural transformation to be =
a natural transformation between the restrictions of the two partial functo=
rs to the intersections of their domain of definition (or a subcategory the=
reof).=0A=

Here is a basic and quite natural interpretation (if someone has not=0A=
already pointed this out):=0A=
=0A=
One can have a n.t  F =3D> G iff F is less defined than G and on their comm=
on=0A=
domain (which is just the domain of F) there is a natural transformation=0A=
from F =3D> \rst{F} G.   Partial functors, of course, form a restriction=0A=
category so they are naturally partial order enriched (by restriction).=0A=
This 2-cell structure must simply respect this partial order ...=0A=
=0A=
This is certainly not the only possibility, unfortunately ... for example=
=0A=
why not also allow partial natural transformations ... which are less=0A=
defined than the functor.   Here one does have to be a bit careful: a=0A=
natural transformation must "know" the subcategory it is working with ...=
=0A=
thus defining the natural transformation as a function on arrows (rather=0A=
than just objects) is worthwhile adjustment (see MacLane page 19, Excercise=
=0A=
5).  This then works too ....=0A=
=0A=
I hope this helps.=0A=
