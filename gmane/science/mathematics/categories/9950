While I don't recall the course title, my recollection is that the year Max
taught category theory to Ross and other third year students was 1964.  Max
was going to move on to algebraic topology in 1965 (our honours year, 14 in
that class including Brian Day and Henry Irgang) until he realized we'd
never seen point set topology so he settled for that.

The first homework for the latter was to enumerate the T0 spaces up to
three points (or perhaps four, which is still feasible for a homework
though tedious).  In those days I was much more at home with combinatorics
than algebra so that was a fun homework for me.  Maybe that's why I ended
up in computer science.  I didn't really warm to algebra until 1979, in
particular universal algebra courtesy of Rasiowa and Sikorski, despite
having taught a groups-rings-fields course at MIT in 1972, and it was a
couple of years more before I started to come to grips with categories.
