This is wrong! Let EE be the free topos (with nno). Then the
fibration Fam(EE) over Set is a fibered ccc but if it were a cartesian
closed functor between toposes then EE would have small sums which it hasn't.

It is not clear at all which fibrations of ccc's over ccc's have the
property that they are ccc-preserving functors between ccc's. It seems
as if such fibrations have to be internally complete. That's what I
definitely overlooked.

Sorry for that,
Thomas
