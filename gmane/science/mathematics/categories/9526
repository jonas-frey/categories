Topos theory gives a solid account of local connectedness, where each open -=
  indeed, each sheaf - has a set (discrete space) of connected components. Th=
e definition of locally connected geometric morphism covers not only individ=
ual spaces but also bundles, considered fibrewise. It also covers generalize=
d spaces as well as ungeneralized.

Is there an analogous theory for where the space of connected components is S=
tone? ("Connected" is now defined by orthogonality with respect to Stone spa=
ces instead of discrete spaces.)

The obvious example is any Stone space X, for instance, Cantor space, where X=
  is its own space of connected components. We get Stone spaces of connected c=
omponents more generally for any compact regular space - take the Stone spac=
e corresponding to the Boolean algebra of clopens. People tend not to notice=
  the Stone space aspects in the usual examples based on real analysis, since=
  they are also locally connected. Being a Stone space then just makes the se=
t of connected components finite with decidable equality. For any compact re=
gular space, we find that each closed subspace has a Stone space of connecte=
d components.

(By the way, if you wonder what brought me to this, it was from pondering th=
e symmetric monad M on Grothendieck toposes. Bunge and Funk proved that for u=
ngeneralized spaces its localic reflection is the lower powerlocale, which r=
aises the question of whether there is a missing topos construction whose lo=
calic reflection is the upper powerlocale. On the other hand, the symmetric m=
onad is related to local connectedness. Points of MX are cosheaves on X, and=
  X is locally connected if there is a terminal cosheaf in a strong sense, wi=
th that cosheaf providing the sets of connected components. Perhaps understa=
nding the Stone space view of connected components would cast light on this m=
issing construction.)

All the best,

Steve.=
