Dear colleagues,

I have learned from Luciano Stramaccia, with great
sadness, that our colleague and friend Armin Frei
passed away at the age of 82, on June 10th, 2016.
He had been a student of Beno Eckmann at ETH in
Zurich and became an active participant in the
development of category theory, in particular with
regard to applications to shape theory. He was a
professor emeritus from the University of British
Columbia and later he spent the last years of his
life in his homeland Ticino/Switzerland, doing
mathematics, and paragliding.
His friends and collaborators will miss him.

Bill Lawvere
