Dear Jamie,

Let me add to Steve's remarks that:

If one wishes to work in a purely algebraic setting, then it is
possible to give a notion of tricategory which is such that the
bicategories together with their homomorphisms, strong natural
transformations and modifications comprise a canonical instance of
this structure. This can be done by using this latter requirement to
inform the very definition of tricategory that one gives.

More specifically, I mean to suggest that one works in the setting of
Michael Batanin's globular operads. Such a globular operad encodes a
notion of higher category by describing the forms of composition that
each instance of this notion must come equipped with. There are a SET
of such composition operations for each reasonable shape of diagram
which one might wish to compose; in particular, for the diagram whose
shape is that of a pair of horizontally composable 2-cells.

We might derive such a set of operations as follows. Consider the
category M whose objects are given by a triple of finitely presentable
bicategories A, B, C, homomorphisms f, g : A -> B and h, k : B -> C,
and a pair of strong natural transformations a : f => g and b : h =>
k; and whose morphisms (A,B,C,f,g,h,k,a,b) ->
(A',B',C',f',g',h',a',b') are given by a triple of STRICT
homomorphisms u:A -> A', v:B -> B', w:C -> C' commuting with all the
other data.

There is a corresponding category N whose objects are given by a
single strong transformation a : f => g : A -> B between homomorphisms
between finitely presentable bicategories, and whose morphisms are
given by compatible strict homomorphisms A->A' and B->B'. We now
consider the set of all functors M -> N which on objects send
(A,B,C,f,g,h,k,a,b) to a strong natural transformation of the form fh
=> gk and which on morphisms send (u,v,w) to (u,w).

This defines a set of composition operations for diagrams whose shape
is that of a pair of horizontally composable 2-cells. We may in a
similar manner define sets of composition operations for other shapes
of diagrams of 2- and 3-cells, in this way obtaining a globular
operad. (At the 0- and 1-cell level, we take it that there is a unique
composition operation of each shape; we do this because we have a
canonical, strictly unital and associative, way of composing
homomorphisms of bicategories).

This construction does indeed yield a 3-dimensional globular operad as
it is really just the construction of the endomorphism operad of a
globular object in a monoidal globular category, which you may find
described in Michael's paper on the subject. (In fact this is not
quite true as we are doing something slightly different at the 0- and
1-cell level but that is easily accounted for).

The point is that this globular operad is, unless something is
terribly wrong with the world, contractible, meaning that it provides
a fully sensible notion of weak 3-category. And almost by definition,
the totality of bicategories and their weak cells comprise a canonical
instance of this structure.
