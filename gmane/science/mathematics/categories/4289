I'm not sure what "retaining" means here.  Does the category Set, even
as a cartesian category, have *any* properties that are open to debate?
  (Other than by intuitionists, who seem to thrive on quicksand.)  For
Set as a cartesian closed category I can see room for debate about the
number of nonisomorphic sets that can appear along a chain of monics
from X to 2^X when X is infinite (defined say as admitting endomonics
that are not automorphisms), but relatively little in practical
mathematics seems to hinge on the outcome.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but my impression is that for any given
language in which to express properties of Set, whether that of
categories, cartesian categories, cartesian closed categories, or
toposes, the properties of Set, understood classically and up to
equivalence, are essentially fixed modulo largely irrelevant minutiae
such as the above.

Your example is a perfectly identifiable property of any category with
polynomial functors (suitably defined) such as Set.  If the polynomial
functors are those generated from the identity functor by binary product
and coproduct, e.g. X, X+X, X^2, X+X^2, etc. then it holds of Set
because then the initial algebra is always the empty set (but you
probably had the empty product 1 in mind as well).  If Set didn't have
that property it wouldn't be Set, just as Z wouldn't be Z if integer
addition wasn't commutative.

The property P = "for all objects x and y there exists a set z for which
x is a subset of z and y is a member of z" holds of all models of ZF.

It cannot be said to hold of the category Set however, not because we
can't prove it, i.e. can't imagine how assuming it false could do any
harm, but because we can't define it, i.e. can't imagine how it could be
either true or false.  What does it even mean when applied to Set as a
category, or as a cartesian closed category, or even as a topos?  More
structure than that has to be added to Set to make P meaningful.

The same goes for AFA.  Chapters 1-6 of Aczel are developed starting
within the ZF framework.  Categories enter at Chapter 7, but Set is
already fully encumbered at that point with all the machinery necessary
to interpret all sentences of the language of ZF, where P is true.  In
that sense even FA (the Foundation Axiom) creates properties of Set that
are not meaningful for Set as a mere topos.

AFA as a weakening of FA means that generically there are fewer
properties than with FA, not more.  Fixing a particular model of AFA
creates properties specific to the model, which may or may not
contradict FA.  (Every model of ZF is automatically a model of ZF-FA+AFA.)
