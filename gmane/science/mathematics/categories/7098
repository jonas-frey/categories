(Subject: lax 2-categories; lax cubical categories)

Sorry for the delay.

You can find part of the story (as I know it) in the Introduction of =20
my paper [3], cited by Robin Houston.

1. Burroni [1] introduced in 1971, a 'pseudocategory', with the =20
following directions for the comparison cells:

      f  -->  f*1,      f  -->  1*f,      (h*g)*f  -->  h*(g*f).

Borceux, in his text on category theory, mentions a similar notion of =20=

'lax category', in a remark after the
definition of bicategory.

2. Leinster's book [2] introduces a 'lax bicategory' as an 'unbiased' =20=

structure where all multiple compositions
are assigned and there are comparison cells from each iterated =20
composition to the corresponding multiple
composition, as in the following examples:

       (k*h*g)*f --> k*h*g*f,        (1*(h*g*1))*f --> h*g*f.

This has the advantage of a clear formal criterion for the direction =20
of comparisons.

3. My paper [3] is about a fundamental 'd-lax 2-category' for a =20
'directed space'. The arrows are its directed
paths, composed by concatenation; a cell is a homotopy class of =20
homotopies of paths; we have comparison
cells with direction:

     1 * a  -->  a  -->  a * 1,        a*(b*c) -> (a*b)*c,

because these (directed) homotopies can only move towards 'hastier' =20
concatenations of paths.
Eg the lazy path  1 * a  sleeps half of the time at its beginning, =20
then runs to reach its end;
the original  a  is hastier (makes at each instant a longer way);
but  a * 1  is even hastier: it runs twice as fast, then can sleep =20
half of the time at its end.

The term 'd-lax' is meant to refer to such a direction of =20
comparisons, motivated by directed homotopy.

But you can easily define n-ary concatenations of paths, by the =20
obvious n-partition of the standard interval.
In [3] there is also a fundamental 'unbiased d-lax 2-category', where =20=

we also have comparison cells:

       a*(b*c)  -->  a*b*c  -->  (a*b)*c,

4. It seems to be difficult to proceed this way to higher fundamental =20=

categories for a directed space X.
In a recent paper [4], I have taken a different way: an (infinite =20
dimensional) fundamental lax cubical
category.
An n-cube is a map from the standard directed n-cube  [0, 1]^n  to  =20
X;  obviously, they have  n
concatenation laws (but letting symmetries in, we can reduce =20
everything to one of them).
Then we need comparisons, with a strict law; these are obtained by =20
reparametrisation of the standard
cube, and behave quite differently from those of point 3:

- they are invertible for associativity, where you can reparametrise =20
both ways,
- they are directed for unitarity, where you can reparametrise a =20
cube  a  so to make it lazy at the
    beginning or the end, but you cannot destroy sleeping times once =20
they are there (!),
- they are identical for interchange.

Best regards

Marco Grandis
