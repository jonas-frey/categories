This will be true if V is complete (as you suppose below anyway). =
Writing, for simplicity, in the case where V is symmetric, the internal
hom [f,g] for functors f,g:X->V_0 is given by the formula (which I hope =
will be legible)

[f,g]x =3D int_y [X(x,y).f(y),g(y)]

Here X(x,y) is the hom-set in X, and X(x,y).f(y) is the coproduct of =
X(x,y) copies of f(y), and int_y denotes the end over all object y in X.

This is a special case of Brian Day's convolution structure where the =
promonoidal structure on X is the ``cartesian'' one, corresponding
to the cartesian closed structure on [X,Set].

> Second question: supposing that V_0^X is  indeed closed and that V is =
suitably complete, so that reindexing along f has a right adjoint =
forall_f, then V_0^X is enriched over V by forall_X(A->B). How is this =
enrichment related to the usual one of [X,v]  when X is a V-category?
>=20

They're the same, essentially because limits commute with limits.=20

All the best,

Steve.
