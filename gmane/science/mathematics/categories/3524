Hi Dusko,

One of Elsevier's motives (and  other publishers) is close to
trying to corner the market
or at least squeeze out all the profit possible

we now have several ways to resist
1. choice of journal to which we submit papers
B. choice of journal for which we will perform slave labor (editing)
III. advice in re the above to our mentees
