  SUMMER SCHOOL ON
  CONTEMPORARY CATEGORICAL METHODS IN ALGEBRA AND TOPOLOGY

  Haute-Bodeux, Belgium, 3-10 June 2007

In the tradition of previous meetings held at this location, a Summer=20
School on Contemporary Categorical Methods in Algebra and Topology will=20
be held in Haute-Bodeux, a village in the Ardennes region of south-east=20
Belgium, from June 3 (arrival day) until June 10, 2007 (departure day).=20
The primary aim of the meeting is to provide students and young=20
researchers who already have a working knowledge of categories with an=20
opportunity to learn about various topics of interest in categorical=20
algebra and topology, including

- categorical and topological aspects of semi-abelian theories,
- categorical descent and Galois theory,
- accessible categories and their applications to homotopy theory,
- lax-algebraic methods in categorical topology.

However, more established researchers in nearby fields who wish to=20
enhance their knowledge on these topics are also welcome. Lecture series=20
will be given by the following researchers who constitute the Scientific=20
Committee of the meeting:

- Maria Manuel Clementino
- Dominique Bourn
- George Janelidze
- Jiri Rosicky
- Walter Tholen.

If time permits there will be an opportunity for participants to present=20
talks on their own research. The local organizer of the Summer School is=20
Francis Borceux. It is estimated that the total cost of the meeting will=20
be about 975 Euros per person: this covers the registration fee,=20
transportation from and to Brussels airport or Li=E8ge railway station (o=
n=20
the designated arrival and departure days), accommodation and meals=20
(including conference dinner and drinks with meals), social activities=20
and an excursion (excluding dinner on the excursion day). Unfortunately,=20
the organizers do not have funds available to provide any financial=20
support.

Accommodation in Haute-Bodeux is strictly limited, and attendance at the=20
meeting will be by invitation only. However, anyone who wishes to be=20
considered for invitation, or to propose names of people who might be=20
invited, is asked to send an e-mail to Walter Tholen=20
<tholen@mathstat.yorku.ca> before the end of September 2006. It is=20
expected that invitations will be sent out early in November 2006. Those=20
invited will be sent formal letters of invitation to assist them in=20
obtaining funding, and will also be provided with a reading list of=20
material which may be assumed in the Summer School lectures.
