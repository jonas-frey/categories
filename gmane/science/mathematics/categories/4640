As others have already noted, the answer is no.  One possible
solution (assuming you regard this as a defect) is to apply
the idea implicit in the definition of Kelley space, not to
the category of all topological spaces, but to that of all
Tychonov (=uniformisable) spaces.  What results is a cartesian
closed category (that of "k_R-Tychonov spaces") with somewhat
different properties; a group in this category is tautologously
uniformisable and, if I recall correctly, is also true that the
operations are uniformly continuous.  Gabor Lukacs has studied
these things and spoken about them at several conferences.

Cheers,
Jeff.
