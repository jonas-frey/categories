   Linear Logic 2016 will be a four-day meeting in Lyon, including three eve=
nts:
   - Autumn school on linear logic (Nov 7-8)
   - Workshop 'Linear logic and philosophy' (Nov 8, afternoon)
   - Workshop 'Linear logic, mathematics and computer science' (Nov 9-10)
   The present announcement is a call for submission of abstracts to the
   workshop 'Linear logic, mathematics and computer science' (Nov 9-10) and
   a call for participation for all three events (see below).
   * CONTEXT
   Linear logic was introduced 30 years ago and has rapidly become a
   pivot point between mathematical logic and computer science. This field
   has diversified into various chapters: proof-nets, categorical
   semantics, geometry of interaction, game semantics etc. These chapters
   have provided many tools and concepts useful in computer science to
   analyse, understand, control and generalise computational dynamics.
   The contribution of linear logic to the logical foundations
   of computer science has also influenced other fields, e.g. computational =
linguistics
   and quantum computing, and it has inspired philosophical investigations
   around the computational approach to logic. For these reasons the present
   event aims to gather mathematicians, computer scientists and
   philosophers in order to foster interaction in research on linear logic.
   The following three events are organised. Registration instructions for
   all events are below.
   * AUTUMN SCHOOL ON LINEAR LOGIC (Nov 7-8)
   This school is mainly directed towards Master's students with a
   background in logic and philosophy, computer science or mathematics. It
   is also open to PhD students and researchers who would like to learn
   about linear logic.
   The goal is to give a structured introduction to the main concepts and
   results in  linear logic. It will assume as prerequisites only a basic
   knowledge of classical logic and of formal proof systems (sequent
   calculus or natural deduction). The aim is to allow the participants to
   understand, in particular, the motivations and origins of linear logic,
   its logical connectives, sequent calculus, proof-nets, semantics,
   relationships with intuitionistic and classical logic etc.
   The lectures will be given in English. More detailed information
   about the programme and the lecturers will be available on the web site.
   * WORKSHOP 'Linear logic and philosophy' (Nov 8, afternoon)
   This meeting will consist of invited talks only. It will address some
   of the philosophical issues raised by linear logic such as the computatio=
nal
   foundations of logic, the problem of proof representation, and the interf=
ace
   between logic and physics.
   * WORKSHOP 'Linear logic, mathematics and computer science' (Nov 9-10)
   This workshop will consist of invited talks (TBA on the web page soon)
   and contributed ones. For contributed talks, authors are invited to
   submit an abstract following the instructions below. Submissions on all
   topics related to linear logic in its relations with mathematics and
   computer science are welcome, for instance, but not exclusively:
   - proof-nets
   - denotational and categorical semantics
   - geometry of interaction, game semantics
   - linear type systems
   - implicit computational complexity
   CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS
   We invite the submission of abstracts at most 2 pages long. Submission is
   electronic, in text or PDF format, via the web site of the workshop at
   at<https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/>.
   - Sep 10, 2016: deadline for submission of abstracts
   - Sep 25, 2016: notification
   * VENUE
   - The school (Nov 7-8) will take place at Universite Lyon 3.
   - The workshop 'Linear logic and philosophy' (Nov 8, afternoon) will
   take place at Universite Lyon 3.
   - The workshop 'Linear logic, mathematics and computer science' (Nov 9-10=
)
   will take place at ENS Lyon.
   Further travel and venue information will be made available on the web si=
te.
   * REGISTRATION (FOR ONE OR SEVERAL EVENTS)
   - Deadline for registration: Sep 30, 2016
   - No registration fees
   - To register, see the web page:https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/
   * STUDENT GRANTS
   A limited number of student grants for the autumn school are available.
   Grants can cover local expenses (accommodation and meals) and transport.
   Applications to attend the four days of LL2016 will be considered favoura=
bly.
   Applications should contain a short curriculum vitae (mentioning the
   degree prepared, e.g. Master's or PhD), a letter from a person supervisin=
g
   the student (e.g. director of the Master's programme, Master's thesis
   supervisor or PhD supervisor), and a short motivation letter by the
   applicant. Please follow the instructions that will be made available
   on the web page.
   The deadline for application for student grants is Sep 20, 2016.
