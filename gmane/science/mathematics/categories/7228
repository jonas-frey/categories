Dear categorists and process algebraists,

I'd be very grateful for any feedback on my current work, summarised at

http://lama.univ-savoie.fr/~hirschowitz/papers/dcats-confs.pdf

and more fully developed in the drafty long version

http://lama.univ-savoie.fr/~hirschowitz/papers/double-cats.pdf .

The reason I'm writing to both lists is that it is about a semantics for
CCS, which uses rather sophisticated category theory (to me at least).

For process algebraists: the semantics may be viewed either as a
presheaf semantics with innocence, or as a game semantics with the
possibility of accepting a play in several ways.

For categorists: the involved tools include pseudo double categories,
polynomial functors, and 2-categorical limits.

Here's an abstract:


We introduce a new algebraic structure called playground. From any
playground D we construct

(1) a language S(D) and its operational semantics (a labelled
    transition system (LTS)) and

(2) a game (or presheaf) semantics.

We then construct an LTS G(D) for strategies in the game semantics,
and a translation from terms to strategies, which is shown to be a
strong, functional bisimulation.

We consider a particular playground, D_ccs, which makes previous work
with Pous (2011) on Milner's CCS an instance of our framework.
Finally, we exhibit a functional, weak bisimulation of standard CCS
into S(D_ccs), which shows that the game semantics of CCS given with
Pous is a weak bisimulation. Weakness of bisimulation here is not
w.r.t. synchronisation, but w.r.t. a kind of administrative reductions
close to heating in the chemical abstract machine (Berry and Boudol,
1990).

Thanks in advance for any comments,
Tom
