The use of a lot of terminologies stemming from topology for describing=20
purely algebraic properties seems to be widespread  and fashionable among=
  an=20
important part of the community of categorists.
This may be a convenient source of intuition and analogies by giving a=20
topological or geometrical fragrance to such algebraic concepts.
However the considerable drawback is that this habit is a source of=20
unsolvable clashes for people who are currently using topological or more=
=20
specially Lie groupoids, more generally structured (in Ehresmann's sense)=
,=20
i. e. internal, groupoids, who are obliged to create alternative=20
terminologies.
For the special case of the duet discrete/undiscrete (or indiscrete, or=20
sometimes coarse) I'm personally using presently null/banal (there are a =
lot=20
of different terminologies used by various authors).
(As to the term "chaotic", I prefer to avoid comments, being afraid to=20
perturb the beautifully non chaotic weather we are presently enjoying in =
our=20
region).
