I'll try to explain why there is no contradiction.
1. Charles only participated actively to the Bourbaki group from 1935 =20
to the mid forties, at a time he did not know category theory. In 1935 =20
he had written a first version for the volume "Theorie des ensembles" =20
where he introduced the notions of local structures and associated =20
pseudogroups of transformations (not so far from groupoids!), but this =20
version was not accepted and he did not like the final version =20
published much later. After the war, he only participated irregularly =20
because he felt that he was no more able to make himself heard, the =20
decisions being taken by "those who spoke the more loudly" (as he said =20
to me).
2. Around 1950 it was decided that active participation ended at 45 =20
(the age Charles had then), lessening the influence of those =20
(Eilenberg, Cartan, Chevalley and Dieudonne) who  could have stressed =20
the importance of categories. I don't know exactly when Grothendieck =20
became a member, but it was much later, and I think he did not remain =20
for long. Later on, disdain for category theory had developed in =20
France...
3. As for the communication between Charles and the other =20
category-theorists, he had no contact with Grothendieck who was much =20
younger. He was friendly with Eilenberg but did not see him often. =20
Before the war he lived in Paris and regularly met Henri Cartan, =20
Dieudonne, and more specially, Chevalley (both had regular exchanges =20
with the philosophers Cavailles and Lautman). But their communication =20
almost ceased after the war when he developed all his activity in =20
Strasbourg (up to 1955) and was out of France for a long part of the =20
year. Anyway, before our joint work (from the mid sixties up to his =20
death), Charles worked essentially alone and published no joint work =20
at all, except 6 Notes on Topology or Geometry with some of his =20
students. When he began to specialize in category theory in the =20
sixties, it was not well understood by other French mathematicians, =20
and his influence dwindled up to a real opposition in the seventies.
