I would say both "The dual category of Set is Set^{op}."
and "CABA is a dual category of Set."
(and also "CABA is an opposite category of Set.").
Actually, I would probably do the grammar differently:
"CABA is a category dual [or "opposite"] to Set.".

Leduc's original question didn't have an article in it;
you seem to have interpreted is with "a" while I interpreted it with "the".
(We also interpreted "dual object" differently.)
