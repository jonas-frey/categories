I have to admit that I never tested it, just copied the complaint from
texhax, usually reliable.  I just tried it on a file created by dvipdfm (I
rarely use pdftex or pdflatex) and it seems fine.  I have version 8.1.1.
So perhaps it was an early bug, now corrected.

But my main point--that we cannot tie our future to commercial software
that the proprietor can change at will--remains valid.
