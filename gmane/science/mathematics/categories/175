Apologies for the faulty messages.

Eleven replies!  Thanks to everyone.

Two obvious benefits: a line is easier to
type and occupies less space than a vertical
arrow.

"... The notation itself goes back to Gentzen, I think, but the meaning was
not the same there -- he meant that the implication below the line
could be deduced from the implication above the line."

"In logic ... you put a double horizontal
line if you want to emphasize that the
rule goes both ways."

So in Cat. Th., a single line might represent
an arrow while a double line would represent
a bijection?  Apparently this convention
isn't well established.

Regards,       ... Peter E.
