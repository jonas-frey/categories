In "Towards a categorical foundation of mathematics", Makkai wrote that:

"This suggests that, possibly, the right approach to the definition of weak
n-category is to aim at formulating all coherence conditions at once,
regardless the fact that this might give a very "theoretical" definition. It
would then be a separate, and still very important, project to find a
(hopefully) finite and concise set of coherence conditions that would be
enough to imply all coherence conditions."

It was 15 years ago! Did this approach give something?
