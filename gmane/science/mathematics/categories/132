PS

The Isbell envelope arises from the Isbell conjugate pair
which is the adjoint pair of functors connecting set^(T^op)
and (set^T)^op. It is thus a special case of the general
construction in my thesis (TAC Reprints) of the total
category with two descriptions which objectifies the
notion of adjointness, in order to free it from dependence
on enrichments in small sets. (Of course the example
depends on enrichments in small sets.)
