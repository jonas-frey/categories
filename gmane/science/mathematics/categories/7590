I make some presicions on my previous posting:

go to the link,

https://simonsfoundation.org/category/features/science-lives/

click on deligne photo, then click BIO AND PHOTOS, then read there.

My posting should be read more accurately as follows:

I have not see the interview of Deligne by MacPherson in the link above,
but I read in that link the comments of Munford and Tate on the
mathematics of Deligne as opposed to the mathematics of Grothendieck,
comments that also apply (if you want) to the mathematics of Serre as
opposed to the mathematics of Grothendieck.

Then Serre says that Deligne is best.

It is interesting to notice that when  describing the characteristics
and virtues of Deligne's mathematics Munford and Tate could be
just describing  the characteristics and virtues of Serre's mathematics.
Clearly Deligne's and Serre's mathematics are similar in those aspects
and different to Grothendieck's. In putting Deligne's mathematics at the
top, Serre is just putting his own mathematics at the top.

I have not see the interview of Deligne by MacPherson in the link above,
but I read in that link the comments of Serre on the mathematics of
Deligne as opposed to the mathematics of Grothendieck, and his
conclusion that Deligne is best. It is interesting to notice that when
describing the characteristics and virtues of Deligne's mathematics he
is just describing  the characteristics and virtues of his own
mathematics. Clearly Deligne's and Serre's mathematics are similar and
different to Grothendieck's. In putting Deligne's mathematics at the
top, Serre is just putting his own mathematics at the top.
