We would like to announce a Reynolds memorial paper that has just been
published in a volume edited by John Power and Cai Wingfield:

Logical Relations and Parametricity =E2=80=93=20
A Reynolds Programme for Category Theory and Programming Languages
(Dedicated to the memory of John C. Reynolds, 1935=E2=80=932013)

Abstract

In his seminal paper on =E2=80=9CTypes, Abstraction and Parametric Poly=
morphism,=E2=80=9D
John Reynolds called for homomorphisms to be generalized from functions=
  to
relations. He reasoned that such a generalization would allow type-base=
d
=E2=80=9Cabstraction=E2=80=9D (representation independence, information=
  hiding, naturality
or parametricity) to be captured in a mathematical theory, while accoun=
ting
for higher-order types. However, after 30 years of research, we do not =
yet
know fully how to do such a generalization. In this article, we explain=
  the
problems in doing so, summarize the work carried out so far, and call f=
or a
renewed attempt at addressing the problem.

icity.pdf

---

Part of our intent in writing this article has been to regenerate inter=
est
in the problem of parametricity, which some people perceive as having d=
ied
down after sustained efforts in the 90's, and to provide clean definiti=
ons
for new entrants to the area.  So, if you have wondered what parametric=
ity
is all about, we hope you will find the answers here.

We continue to work on parametricity ourselves and we would be very gla=
d to
hear from other people who would like to get involved.  If you have wor=
k
that we have missed, please let us know about it as well.  (We couldn't=
  cite
all the work we would have liked to cite due to page limitations.)
