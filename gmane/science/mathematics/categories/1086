Perhaps some precisions should be added to Paul's msg.

Because of my thesis' work (on not-unrelated subjects to those mentioned
by Paul) I had already dealt with permutations in power types when Paul
started pushing his groupoid models. They indeed give rise to "the most
horrendous mess". This was a long time ago, my memory is vague, but I
probably told him, or hinted, that in my opinion they were most likely a
blind alley. I still think that if I started working again in this
field, the problem I would zero in would be to get rid of the
permutation groups, by "unraveling" them by the means of actions (the
groupoid associated with the action of a group on a set can be made much
simpler than the group itself). The point of semantics is to give you
insights about the logic, so simplicity is... a big plus.

And since I refereed his CTCS paper, I *did* read it.
