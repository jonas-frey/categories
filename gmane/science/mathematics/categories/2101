Sammy Eilenberg told me he wrote a paper based on the Day-Kelly paper

	On topological quotient maps preserved by pullbacks or products,
	Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 67 (1970) 553-558.

I believe Sammy's paper was for an MAA expository series.  It sounded
a beautiful approach but I did not see the manuscript and forget the
details.  While the paper was in the universal categorical spirit it
made only one parenthetic remark that something was a category. Sammy
claimed this was why the paper was rejected.  What a great pity!

I would love to have a copy of the preprint. Does anyone else know about it?
