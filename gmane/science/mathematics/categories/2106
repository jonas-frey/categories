In Errett Bishop's Constructive Analysis (anyone who is interested in
analysis over a topos absolutely must know this book), he proves that for
any continuous endomorphism f of a disk and for every eps > 0, there is a
point x in the disk for which |f(x) - x| < eps.  A couple of points should
be made.  First f has to be constructible and eps has to be provably
positive.  For Bishop, a real number is an equivalence class of pairs of
RE sequences of integers a_n and b_n such that for all m,n |a_n/b_n -
a_m/b_m| < 1/m + 1/n and a function is constructive if it is a machine for
turning one such sequence into another.  To be continuous, it there must
be a function delta(eps) that produces for each eps > 0, a delta(eps) such
that |x - y| < delta(eps) implies that |f(x) - f(y)| < eps.  (In fact,
there is a non-constructive proof that every constructive function is
continuous.)

Bishop then claims, without proof as far as I can see, that there is a
fixed point free endomorphism of the disk.  What this means is that when
you extend this function to all reals, any fixed point is not a
constructible real number.
