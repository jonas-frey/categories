Dear Ross, Dear all,

In a recent mail I asked Ross if pseudo cartesian functors between =
pseudo fibrations had been studied.
There are many generalizations of fibrations. Pseudo fibrations are only =
one of them. But there are also prefibrations, defined by Grothendieck, =
but almost never considered, and pre foliations, which I  define here, =
which generalise greatly pre fibrations. For such pre foliatons, I =
define cartesian functors  and show that they have striking properties, =
most of which are not known, even in the very special case of =
fibrations.
I thought this brief survey might interest you, in case you decide to =
study seriously the properties of pseudo cartesian functors.

Best regards to all,
Jean

1)  PRE FOLIATIONS AND FOLIATIONS.
1.1. Notations and first definitions.
If  P: X -> S  is a functor, I denote by  V(P), abbreviated by V, the =
set of vertical maps for P . For every object  s  of  S  I denote by  =
X_s  the fiber  of X over s.=20
In order to deal, not only with fibrations but also with pre fibrations, =
as defined by Grothendieck, and even with more general notions such as =
pre foliations and foliations that I shall define, I adopt =
Grothendieck's definition of cartesian maps, namely:
A map  k: y -> x  of  X is cartesian  iff  for every map  f: z ->x  such =
  Pf =3D Pk there exits a unique vertical map v: z ->y  such that  f =3D =
kv.
I denote by  K(P) , abbreviated  by  K , the set of these maps.
I call hyper cartesian the maps which in the english texts are called =
cartesian and I denote by H(P), abbreviated by H, the set  of these =
maps. They will play very little role in this brief survey.

1.2.  DEFINITION. A functor  P: X --> S  is a pre foliation iff every =
map  f  of  X  can be factored  as  f =3D kv  with k in K and v in V.
If moreover K is stable by composition, I say that  P  is a foliation.

1.3.  Remarks.
(a) pre foliations and foliations are first order notions and can be =
internalized.
(b) with universes and AC Grothendieck showed that his construction =
worked also for lax functors into Cat and gave pre fibrations. But there =
is no reindexing, even lax, for pre foliations.=20
(c) Even when K is stable by composition, in many examples H will be =
strictly contained in K.
(d) Foliations need not even be Giraud fibrations (sometimes called =
Conduch=E9 fibrations).
(e) There are many significant examples of (pre) foliations which are =
not (pre) fibrations, but I cannot give them in such a brief survey.=20

2) CARTESIAN FUNCTORS
Let  P: X --> S,  P': X' --> S  and  F: X --> X' be functors such that  =
P =3D P'F.  For every object s of S ,I denote by  F_s : X_s --> X'_s  =
the functor induced by  F  on the fibers.=20
I have a general definition of F being cartesian, without any assumption =
on P and P' and without any reference to cartesian maps, but it uses =
distributors in an essential manner.
I shall not need it in this survey and shall give the definition only =
when  P is a pre foliation, but without any assumption on P'.

2.1. DEFINITION. If P is a pre foliation and P'F =3D P, I say that  F is =
cartesian iff it satisfies the following two conditions:
(i) It preserves cartesian maps, i.e.  k in K(P) =3D> Fk in K(P').
(ii) For every f': y' --> F(x)  in X' , with y' in X' and x in X, there =
exist  f: y -->x  in X, and  v': y' --> F(y)  in V(P') such that  f' =3D =
F(f)v'.

2.2. Remarks:=20
(a) Condition (i) goes without saying but (ii) may seem surprising.=20
However if P is a pre fibration, without any assumption on P',  (i) =3D> =
(ii). Moreover this implication characterizes pre fibrations among pre =
foliations.
In particular if both P and P' are pre fibrations, our definition =
coincides with Grothendieck's.
(b) In the literature cartesian functors have been considered mostly =
when both P and P'  are fibrations, and, even in that case, not much has =
been said about their properties. Compare with the following:

2.3.  THEOREM. If P is a pre foliation, P' arbitrary, and F is =
cartesian, then:
(1)  F is faithful  iff every  F_s  is.
(2)  F is full iff every F_s   is.
(3)  F is essentially surjective iff every  F_s  is.
(4)  F is final iff every  F_s  is.
(5)  F is flat iff every  F_s  is.
(6)  F has a left adjoint iff every  F_s  has.
If moreover P is a foliation, then
(7)  F is conservative iff every  F_s  is.

2.3.  Remarks:=20
I would like to insist on the fact that I assume nothing on P' in the =
theorem.
Most of these results are not known even in the classical case where =
both P and P' are fibrations.(See e.g. the Elephant)
I had proved all these results, in that case, already in 1983, more than =
30 years ago, and I intended to add them, with many other things, to the =
Roisin notes in the book I was writing on fibered categories. But by =
that time the notes had been circulated, and their content was used with =
very little, if any, reference to me. I'm glad I kept these results to =
myself for two reasons:
(a) As many of the results in the Roisin notes, they would be now in the =
Elephant, of course uglily  re-indexed, and of course without any =
reference to me. If anyone doubts that, let me recall that my paper on =
distributors is not mentioned in the pharaonic bibliography of  the =
Elephant, and neither is my joint note with Roubaud on descent, although =
both are used in the book!=20
I have personally addressed my last 3 mails on fibrations to Peter =
Johnstone and have had no reaction so far. I hope this one will be more =
successful.
(b) By a careful and repeated analysis of the proofs, over many years, =
trying to understand what made them tick, I ended up with the notion of =
(pre) foliation which generalizes greatly (pre) fibrations and has a lot =
of significant examples.
Of course the previous theorem is a very small sample of what can be =
said about (pre) foliations.=20

I have made this mail public. I hope it will not have the same fate as =
the Roisin notes, and if some of it is used full credit will be given to =
me.
