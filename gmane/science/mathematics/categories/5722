In the article

J. Rosicky, W. Tholen, "Factorization, fibration and torsion", J.
Homotopy Theory and Related Structures (electronic) 2 (2007) 295-314

we prove a result closely related to Problems 3 and 4 below (variations
of which may well have appeared earlier?), as follows:

In a finitely complete category C,  (E,M) is a simple reflective
factorization system of C (in the sense of Cassidy, Hebert, Kelly, J.
Austr. Math. Soc 38, (1985)) if, and only if, there exists a
prefibration P: C ---> B preserving the terminal object of C with E =3D
P^{-1}(Iso B) and M =3D {P-cartesian morphisms}.

Here "prefibration" means that for all objects c in C, the functors C/c
---> B/Pc induced by P have right adjoints, such that the induced
monads are idempotent. (For a fibration one asks the counits to be
identity morphisms.) Of course, Jean's question wants P^(-1)(Iso) to be
replaced by the non-iso-closed class P^(-1)(Identities), which prevents
the class from being part of an ordinary factorization system. But
(without having looked into this at all) I would suspect that there is
probably a (more cumbersome) reformulation of the theorem above which
would address that concern.

Regards,
Walter.
