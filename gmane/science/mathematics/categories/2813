There is a closely related homotopy everything version which I bet can
be adapted to this problem.

Consider \Omega B, the based loop space and F as the fibre over
that base point. Then an argument like that above gives
and action of \Omega B on F which satisfies the usual rules for an
actin only up to homotopy
Easiest way to say it is the adjoint map \MOmega B --> Aut F
meaning the self homotopy equivalences of F
is a strongly homotopy associative map of monids
(if you use Moore loops) or of A_\infty spaces.

It should be in
 "Parallel transport in fibre spaces," Bol. Soc. Mat. Mexicana (1968),
68-86.

or

"Associated fibre spaces," Michigan Math. Journal 15 (1968), 457-470.

Hope that helps
