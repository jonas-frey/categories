Due to the requirements of the restaurant, we have to place a deadline
for letting us know you intend to attend the banquet 19 July, during
the Makkaifest 18 - 20 June 2009 in Montreal.

    http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Makkaifest09/index_e.php

If you plan to attend the banquet, please let us know *BEFORE*
Wednesday noon (GMT) (17 June 2009).  Requests after that time may be
impossible to meet.  If you register, there is a place on the online
form where you can indicate your intentions; otherwise email me
directly.  (If you have already done so, no worries!)

The banquet will be held at the Musee des Beaux Arts, and will cost
around $55 - 60 each (tax & tip included, wine extra), to be paid at
the restaurant. (They will provide receipts.)

If you have special dietary requirements, please let me know - the
restaurant is very accommodating about such requests, as long as they
know in advance.  This includes vegetarian meals, allergies, etc.
The main course will consist of a choice of beef or salmon.
