Hi all again,

thanks to those who replied off-list. The canonical reference is
Joyal=E2=80=93Street's Braided monoidal categories. (Someone else also poin=
ted
out that algebras for the E_2 operad are equivalent to E_1 algebras in
the category of E_1 algebras.)

However, my *actual* desired result is that the multiplication of a
_symmetric_ monoidal category is a braided functor (i.e. commutes with
the braiding=3Dsymmetry in this case). I proved this to my own
satisfaction, but my proof is not very nice, and I'm searching for a
cleaner verification of the required commuting diagram. Surely this
was also known! And if so, what's a good reference (I expect it to be
even earlier than Joyal=E2=80=93Street).

Thanks,
David
