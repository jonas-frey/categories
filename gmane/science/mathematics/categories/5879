I don't know very much about what's been done along Makkai's lines;
I also would like to see a specific (if not final) set of axioms.

But category theory has been done in Martin-L=F6of type theory:
http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~rd/publications/CTMLTT.pdf
It has also been done in the type-theoretic proof assistant Coq:
http://coq.inria.fr/distrib/v8.2/contribs-20090527/ConCaT.html

In both of these, there *is* a notion of equality (or better, identity)
at all types, hence a notion of identity of objects of any given category=
,
allowing one to define isomorphism of categories, etc.
However, this logicians' identity does not match mathematicians' equality=
;
the easiest way to see this is that there are no quotient types.
(This means that already to do set theory, let alone category theory,
you must define a set to be a type equipped with an equivalence relation.
Such a thing is also called "setoid", depending on which author you read.=
)

You an also use Mike Shulman's SEAR, in the variant without identity.
http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/SEAR
http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/SEAR#eqfree
This looks much more like the ordinary language of mathematics.
(Actually, one could modify ETCS in a similar way,
although it would no longer deserve to be called "ETCS".)
