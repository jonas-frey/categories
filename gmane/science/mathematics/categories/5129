If you search for a theorem of category theory that can be immediately
applied to verification, then it will be difficult to find something.

However, in our work on the verification of graph transformation we
found it extremely helpful to work with category theory: it helps you
in thinking about the subject matter, clarifying notions and
especially it helped us to get shorter and more concise proofs (for
instance correctness proofs, proofs of termination, etc.).

Furthermore it is possible to develop generic verification procedures
that work for a whole class of systems or develop tools which are
parametric in the category (of course, it is then necessary to
implement constructions for every specific category separately, but
the overall effort is minimized.)

Below I list a few of our papers on verification where category theory
was helpful. It was not always entirely easy to sell the categorical
background at verification-oriented conferences. So we sometimes
trimmed it down to a minimum in the papers, although we worked with it
much more extensively before.
