=========================================================================

 		Abstract submission:	February 6, 2011

=========================================================================

-- SCOPE --

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with
interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging
uses of algebras and coalgebras in computer science.

This is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the
forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on
Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on
Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place
in Swansea (Wales, 2005), Bergen (Norway, 2007) and Udine (Italy,
2009). The fourth edition will be held in the city of Winchester
(England), a historic cathedral city and the ancient capital of Wessex
and the Kingdom of England.


-- INVITED SPEAKERS --

Vincent Danos (UK)
Javier Esparza (Germany)
Philippa Gardner (UK)
Gopal Gupta (USA)


-- TOPICS OF INTEREST --

We invite submissions of technical papers that report results of
theoretical work on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the
way these results can support methods and techniques for software
development, as well as experience with the transfer of the resulting
technologies into industrial practice. We encourage submissions in
topics included or related to those listed below.

  * Abstract models and logics
    - Automata and languages
    - Categorical semantics
    - Modal logics
    - Relational systems
    - Graph transformation
    - Term rewriting
    - Adhesive categories

  * Specialised models and calculi
    - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems
    - Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed, mobile, and
      context-aware computing
    - General systems theory and computational models (chemical,
      biological, etc)

  * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
    - Abstract data types
    - Inductive and coinductive methods
    - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation)
    - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
    - Semantics of programming languages

  * System specification and verification
    - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification
    - Formal testing and quality assurance
    - Validation and verification
    - Generative programming and model-driven development
    - Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
      hardware/middleware/architectures,
    - Process algebra


-- SUBMISSION GUIDELINES --

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Experience papers are
welcome, but they must clearly present general lessons learned that
would be of interest and benefit to a broad audience of both
researchers and practitioners. As with previous editions, the
proceedings will be published in the Springer LNCS series. Final
papers should be no more than 15 pages long in the format specified by
Springer (see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). It is
recommended that submissions adhere to that format and
length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected
immediately. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included
in a clearly marked appendix. Both an abstract and the full paper must
be submitted by their respective submission deadlines.

A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer
Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), containing extended versions of
selected papers, is also being planned.

-- LOCATION --

Winchester is a beautiful historic city in southern England, known for
its 11th-century cathedral and 12th-century castle. It is located just
under an hour by rail from London Waterloo, and 15 minutes by road or
rail from Southampton Airport. London Heathrow is 50 miles away and
London Gatwick 72 miles away.


-- SATELLITE WORKSHOPS --

CALCO 2011 will be preceded by the CALCO Young Researchers Workshop,
CALCO-Jnr, dedicated to presentations by PhD students and by those who
completed their doctoral studies within the past few years.

A workshop dedicated to tools based on algebraic and/or coalgebraic
principles, CALCO-Tools, will be held on the same dates as the main
CALCO conference.

There are separate submission procedures for CALCO-Jnr and CALCO-Tools.

-- CALCO-Jnr Overview --

The CALCO Young Researchers Workshop invites submissions on the same
topics as the CALCO conference. CALCO-Jnr presentations will be
selected according to originality, significance, and general interest,
on the basis of submitted 2-page abstracts. After the workshop, the
author(s) of each presentation will be invited to submit a full 10-15
page paper on the same topic. Following additional reviewing, selected
papers will be published as a technical report.

http://calco2011.ecs.soton.ac.uk/workshops/calco-jnr.html

-- CALCO-Jnr Dates --

Abstract submission:	May 8, 2011
Author notification:	May 30, 2011
Final version due:	June 30, 2011

-- CALCO-Jnr Programme Committee --

Corina Cirstea (University of Southampton, UK)
Magne Haveraaen (University of Bergen, Norway)
John Power (University of Bath, UK)
Monika Seisenberger (chair, Swansea University, UK)
Toby Wilkinson (University of Southampton, UK)

-- CALCO-Tools Overview --

CALCO-Tools will take place on the same dates as the main CALCO
conference, with no overlap between the technical programmes of the
two events. Topics of interest include systems/prototypes/tools
developed specifically for the design, checking, execution, and
verification of (co)algebraic specifications, but also tools targeting
different application domains while making core or interesting use of
(co)algebraic techniques. Tool submissions should not exceed 5 pages
in LNCS format. The accepted tool papers will be included in the final
proceedings of the conference. The tools should be made available on
the web at the time of submission.
