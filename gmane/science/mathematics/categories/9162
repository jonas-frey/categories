-- SCOPE --

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests
in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging uses of algebra
and coalgebra in computer science.

It is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and
reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in
Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development
Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Swansea (Wales, 2005),
Bergen (Norway, 2007), Udine (Italy, 2009), Winchester (UK, 2011), Warsaw
(Poland, 2013) and Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015).

The seventh edition will be held in Ljubljana, Slovenia, colocated with
MFPS XXXIII.

-- SUBMISSION GUIDELINES --

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English presenting
original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted
for publication elsewhere. Experience papers are welcome, but they must
clearly present general lessons learned that would be of interest and
benefit to a broad audience of both researchers and practitioners.

Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs???Leibniz
International Proceedings in Informatics series. Final papers should be
no more than 15 pages long in the format specified by LIPIcs
(http://www.dagstuhl.de/publikationen/lipics/anleitung-fuer-autoren/).
It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length.
Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected
immediately. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included in
a clearly marked appendix. Both an abstract and the full paper must be
submitted by their respective submission deadlines.

A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer
Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), containing extended versions of
selected papers, is also being planned.

Submissions will be handled via EasyChair
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2017

-- BEST PAPER AND BEST PRESENTATION AWARDS --

This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose
recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a Best
Presentation Award, elected by the participants.

-- IMPORTANT DATES --

         Abstract submission:    April 3, 2017
         Paper submission:       April 7, 2017
         Author notification:    May 15, 2017

==========================================================

-- SCOPE AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES --

A special workshop at CALCO 2017 is dedicated to tools based on algebraic
and/or coalgebraic principles or that are emerging from the intersection of
the two approaches, such as graph grammars or coinductive proof techniques.
These include systems/prototypes/tools developed specifically for design,
checking, execution, and verification of (co)algebraic specifications, but
also tools targeting different application domains while making core or
interesting use of (co)algebraic techniques. CALCO-Tools will take place on
the same dates as the main CALCO conference, with no overlap between the
technical programmes of the two events.

Tool submissions should not exceed 5 pages in LiPiCS format. The accepted
tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference.
The tools should be made available on the web at the time of submission,
for download and evaluation. Each submission will be evaluated by at least
three reviewers; one or more of the reviewers will be asked to download and
use the tool. At least one of the authors of each tool paper must attend
the conference to demo the tool.

Submissions will be handled via the CALCO 2017 Tools EasyChair site
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2017tools

==========================================================

-- SCOPE AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES --

The programme of CALCO 2017 will include special sessions reserved for the
CALCO Early Ideas Workshop, featuring presentations of work in progress and
original research proposals. PhD students and young researchers are
particularly encouraged to contribute. Attendance at the workshop is open
to all conference participants.

The CALCO Early Ideas Workshop invites submissions on the same topics as
the CALCO conference: reporting results of theoretical work, the way these
results can support methods and techniques for software development, as
well as experience with the transfer of the resulting technologies into
industrial practice.

CALCO Early Ideas presentations will be selected according to originality,
significance, and general interest, on the basis of submitted 2-page short
contributions. It can be work in progress, a summary of work submitted to a
conference or workshop elsewhere, or work that in some other way might be
interesting to the CALCO audience. A booklet with the accepted short
contributions will be available at the workshop.

Submissions will be handled via the CALCO 2017 Early Ideas EasyChair site
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2017ei
