PSSL 88 - supplementary announcement

Dear all,

We are delighted by the large number of registrations
and talk proposals we have had for the PSSL in honour
of the joint 60th birthdays of Martin Hyland and Peter
Johnstone.

However, we have already had more talks proposed than
we can accommodate.  Therefore if you would like to
propose a talk and have not already done so, we now
ask you to let us know by January 31st rather than the
end of February as originally planned.  The deadline
for applying for funding is also January 31st, as before.

The PSSL announcement email and registration form can
be found here:

Apologies for the inconvenience.

Eugenia Cheng
