George, Ronnie, et al.,

I think you are engaged in a valiant, but losing, battle. =


Tellingly, just today, in my postal mail, I found a copy of =

the latest issue of The New Yorker, with its mini-biography =

of Jaron Lanier, and his reported lamentation of Wikipedia =

as "a triumph of 'intellectual mob rule'".

(See "Issue of July 11 & 18, 2011", pp. 46-53, esp. p. 46.)

I hold out no hope of seeing much improvement in the parts
of Wikipedia that need improving, and I (for one) have now
given up trying. =


Far be it from me to try to dissuade you, though. So:

Cheers, and best of luck in any event, -- Fred
