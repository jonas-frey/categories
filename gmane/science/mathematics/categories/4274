Every student who learned the basics of operator algebras knows the
Gelfand-Naimark representation theorem, usually stated non-
categorically as "every commutative unital C*-algebra is isomorphic to
the algebra of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space".
Asking such students to check that this is part of a dual equivalence
of categories is probably a good idea, and based on this one can do
exercises about particular algebras they know - for instance to
compute presentations by generators and relations of C(T^n), the
algebra of continuous functions on the n-dimensional torus, which by
the duality is instantly reduced to finding a presentation of C(S^1),
etc. Also, some students might be willing to work out how the
existence of presentations of C*-algebras by generators and relations
relates to the fact that the category of C*-algebras is algebraic over
Sets.
