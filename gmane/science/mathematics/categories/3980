I'd like to say that "connected" is defined on objects of any category C
having an object 1+1 (coproduct of two final objects).  X is connected
just when C(X,1+1) <= 2.

If this definition appears in print somewhere I can just cite it.  If
not is there a better or more standard generally applicable definition I
can use?

If  C(X,1+1) = 2  is citable but not <= 2, have the proponents of =2
taken into account that no Boolean algebra is connected according to the
=2 definition?  This is because 1+1 ~ 1 in Bool, CABA, DLat, StoneDLat,
etc. (dual to 0x0 ~ 0 in Set, Pos, etc.), forcing C(X,1+1) = 1.  Boolean
algebras and distributive lattices fail the =2 test not because they are
disconnected in any natural sense but rather because they are
hyperconnected.  It seems unreasonable to say that hyperconnected
objects are not connected.

There is also the question of the object of connected components of an
object.  In Set and Grph, if X has k connected components then C(X,1+1)
= 2^k for all X, a set (C being ordinary, i.e. enriched in Set).  In
Stone (Stone spaces) however this only holds for finite X, with k = X.
For infinite X Stone(X,1+1) is the set of clopen sets of X, which can be
countably infinite and hence not 2^k for any k.

If we read 2^k as Stone(k,2), taking k = X and 2 the Sierpinski space
this doesn't help.  However Stone(k,1+1) is ideal: instead of treating
the object of connected components of a Stone space k = X as a set we
can treat them as a Boolean algebra, namely that of the clopen sets of X.

These examples are worth bearing in mind when considering the
appropriate general definition of number of connected components of an
object, and whether even to treat it as a number (cardinal) or a more
general object.

Connectedness seems somehow more basic than finiteness because we can
easily draw examples of connected and disconnected objects, whereas it
requires a vivid imagination to see the boundary between finite and
infinite objects one might try to draw on paper.

This motivates making connectedness prior to finiteness.

Another familiar and easily visualized notion with small examples is
that of path.  Define a *path* to be a connected directed graph having
one vertex each of degree (0,1) and (1,0), and all others (1,1).  (The
degree (m,n) specifies the in-degree as m and the out-degree as n.)

We can then define a finite set to be one in bijection with the set of
vertices of some path.  This seems more natural than defining it to be
one such that every injection on itself is a surjection, because there
are a lot of injections to worry about and how do you convince yourself
that surjective injections don't kick in until omega?

Those who are already wedded to some other definition of finite will
want to check that this path-based definition draws the boundary in the
same place as theirs.  For what definitions of "finite" can this not be
shown?  And are any of them more palatable than the path-based definition?
