Dear David,

One convenient setting for your question is provided by _extensive_
categories (see the paper ``Introduction to extensive and distributive
categories'' by Carboni, Lack, and Walters, appearing in JPAA 1993). A
category E with finite coproducts is said to be extensive if for all 
objects x,y of E, the ``coproduct functor'' E/x x E/y --> E/(x+y) is
an equivalence. For such a category E, an object p is prime in your
sense if and only if it is connected, i.e. if and only if it admits no
proper coproduct decomposition; this in turn is equivalent to the 
representable functor E(p,-):E-->Set preserving coproducts.

An example of an extensive category is given by Fam(C) for C a (small)
category. The objects of Fam(C) are finite families (C_i)_{i\in I}
and an arrow from (C_i)_I to (D_j)_J comprises a function f:I-->J and
a family of arrows C_i-->D_fi in C. Fam(C) is the free category with
finite coproducts on the category C. The connected (=prime) objects
are precisely the singleton families. One can characterize the 
categories of the form Fam(C) as those extensive categories with a 
small set of connected objects such that every object is a finite 
coproduct of connected objects. (It seems possible that you could 
replace ``extensive'' in the last sentence by ``category with finite
coproducts'' provided that you also replace ``connected'' by
``prime and connected'', but I haven't thought about this.)

Best wishes,

Steve.
