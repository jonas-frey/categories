Lars, I would guess that you will get more advice than you can
use. Here is my nickel's worth. The matter of coherence is
wide open. There is a paper of Yanofsky accepted for publication
in JPAA which investigates higher dimensional categories with
no coherence assumptions at all -- this coming after a lot of
work on weakened coherence. Benabou's basic point was that
naturally arising 2-dimensional categories are not quite
2-categories and don't seem to suffer from it. Avoid getting
knotted in coherence questions, especially in 1999.
