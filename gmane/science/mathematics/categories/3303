THE SPRING SCHOOL

The Spring School in Theoretical Computer Science is a French institution,
started by Maurice Nivat in 1973.

The School is based on a simple but extraordinarily successful recipe:
bring together the world's specialists of a different topic every year,
for a week, in a beautiful and somewhat recluded part of France.

This year, the Spring School will meet at <<l'Ile de Re>> ---
an exquisite island on the Atlantic Ocean, in front of La Rochelle.

The seaside setting will certainly provide lots of opportunities
for informal discussions and collaborations in the evenings.


GAME THEORY IN SEMANTICS AND VERIFICATION

The Spring School 2006 is designed for students and researchers interested
in learning more about Game Theory and its recent applications to
the Semantics and Verification of Programs and Programming Languages.

The Spring School offers the first international platform for discussing
together the recent advances in these two extremely active topics.

The Spring School is openly multi-disciplinary, and will also introduce
related topics such as Descriptive Set Theory in Mathematical Logic,
or Nash equilibrium in Economic Games.

Lectures will be provided ***in english*** by:

Samson Abramsky (Oxford, UK)
Jacques Duparc (Lausanne, Switzerland)
Paul Gastin (LSV, ENS Cachan)
Erich Gradel (Aachen, Germany)
Martin Hyland (Cambridge, UK)
Luke Ong (Oxford, UK)
Tristan Tomala (Ceremade, Paris Dauphine)
Igor Walukiewicz (Bordeaux)
Wieslaw Zielonka (Paris)

REGISTRATION

We have done our best to limit the registration and accomodation fees
to the following amounts:

--- 250 euros for students in double rooms,
--- 500 euros for researchers in single rooms.


REGISTRATION

We have done our best to limit the registration and accomodation fees
to the following amounts:

--- 250 euros for students in double rooms,
--- 500 euros for researchers in single rooms.

This includes the (somptuous) accomodation, the (perfect) meals,
the coffee breaks, as well as a coach from La Rochelle to l'Ile de Re,
and return.


DEADLINES

An unexpected increase in our financial support enables us to accept
more participants than what was originally forecast. There remains
however only a very limited number of places. We thus ask that
interested people contact the organizers *directly* and *immediately*
at:

mellies@pps.jussieu.fr
muscholl@liafa.jussieu.fr

... immediately meaning before Wednesday, May the 10th, ideally,
and at the latest on Monday, May the 15th.

Further information is provided on the web page of the Spring School:

GIVE A TALK

Depending on the time available, it should be possible for participants
to give a talk on their work at the Spring School. Please indicate
a title and abstract when you register to the School.


Looking forward to meeting you at l'Ile de Re,

-- The organizers

Paul-Andre Mellies (PPS, Paris) and Anca Muscholl (LIAFA, Paris)
