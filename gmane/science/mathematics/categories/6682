                       International Symposium on
Foundations of Health Information Engineering and Systems
                 (http://www.ictac.net/FHIES2011/)
            27-29 August 2011 Mabalingwe Nature Reserve, South Africa
                    (Colocated with ICTAC 2011)


Information and communication technology plays an increasingly enabling
role in addressing the global challenges of healthcare, in both the=20
developed and the developing world, that are the concern of the United=20
Nations, its Peoples and Members States. The use of software in medical=20
devices is already raising issues in relation to safety and efficacy for=20
manufacturers and regulators. Health information systems raise  issues=20
of both privacy and confidentiality, on the one hand, and, increasingly,=20
patient safety on the other. Hospital and other information systems=20
raise important issues of efficacy and interoperability. However, to=20
capitalize on the potential of this technology in reshaping healthcare=20
demands focused research on sound  and safe development techniques from=20
software engineering, electronic  engineering, computing science,=20
information science, mathematics, and  industrial engineering.

Aims
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The purpose of the new symposium series on Foundations of Software=20
Engineering Health Informatics (FHIES) is to promote a nascent research=20
area that aims to develop and apply theories and techniques in computing=20
science and software engineering to modelling, building and certifying=20
software based systems in the application domain of healthcare. Many of=20
these systems are already regulated in many jurisdictions and many more=20
of them will become regulated in the future.

Research on theories, techniques and tools of software modelling,=20
verification and validation has been an important area of computer=20
science and software engineering, known as Formal Methods. This research=20
addresses the challenging problem of design and certification of safety=20
or mission critical software systems through abstraction and=20
decomposition techniques based on the use of mathematical modelling=20
theories and sound engineering methods. Formal methods have primarily=20
addressed the correctness of systems used in the industrial, financial,=20
and defence applications. However, they have recently found application=20
in modelling and analysis of complex systems that involve interacting=20
behaviour of many kinds of objects and agents, including software=20
systems, physical objects and humans. The models of these systems have=20
both discrete and continuous behaviour, and both qualitative and=20
quantitative (e.g., spatial timing and probabilistic) properties. It is=20
believed that these methods can be used for modelling problems of health=20
informatics, which presents the challenge of scalability. Software plays=20
a critical role in sustainable health care, both as part of the solution=20
and as part of the problem. Software intensive information systems are=20
needed to support the collection and processing of vast amounts of data=20
via different devices, and allow policy makers to access and share these=20
data, and to support their decision making and validation. Software=20
systems can be developed for managing, controlling and monitoring=20
policies, processes and workflows in medical systems. Software systems=20
can be developed to help create the sophisticated medical devices that=20
are simply impossible to build without the software. On the other hand,=20
the application of software raises challenging issues in safety,=20
security and privacy, and increases the complexity of healthcare=20
workflows and the need for new business policies.

Paper Submissions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

We solicit high quality submissions reporting on

     1. original research contributions (18 pages maximum in LNCS format)
     2. application experience, case studies and software prototypes (18=20
pages maximum in LNCS format)
     3. surveys, comparisons, and state-of-the-art reports (18 pages=20
maximum in LNCS format)
     4. position papers that define research projects with identified=20
challenges and milestones (10 pages maximum in LNCS format)
     5. proposals for panel discussions, with at least three named=20
panellists, about a topical question (5 pages maximum in LNCS format).

All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution=20
to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the=20
conference. Submissions should be in English, prepared in the LNCS=20
format. Papers should be submitted at=20
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfhies2011. Submission=20
constitutes a commitment to attend and present a paper, if accepted.

All accepted papers will be included in the pre-event proceedings of the=20
symposium and considered for EXCEPT FOR the proposals for panel=20
discussions inclusion in a special issue of the Springer Innovations in=20
Systems and Software Engineering (ISSE), following revision and re-review=
.
