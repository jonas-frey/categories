Dear Jeremy Gibbons=2C

Strangely enough=2C since I have worked "extensively" for years on Lawvere =
distributions=2C I cannot help you locate the preprint in question.=A0But I=
  can answer some of the questions you pose. For that=2C I will quote our bo=
ok=2C Marta Bunge and Jonathon Funk=2C Singular Coverings of Toposes=2C LNM=
  1890=2C Springer 2006 and references therein. It can be downloaded from th=
e web.=A0


There is indeed a (Kock-Zoberlein) monad M (with unit the "Dirac delta" on =
the 2-category Top_S of Grothendieck toposes (actually toposes E bounded ov=
er a base topos S)=2C called the "symmetric monad"=2C such that the S-point=
s of M(E)=2C for E a topos=2C is the category of distributions on E in the =
sense of Lawvere=2C that is=2C the category of cocontinuous functors E-->S =
and natural transformations between them. The existence of the symmetric to=
pos was established by myself (Bunge 1995) using forcing topologies=2C and =
given an "algebraic" construction in (Bunge-Carboni=2C 1995)=2C including t=
he KZ-monad structure. Of course we study (Bunge-Fuk 2006) the M-algebras a=
nd several other matters.=A0


Concerning probability distributions=2C there is a classifying monad too.=
=A0A probability distribution on a topos is a distribution that preserves t=
he terminal object. It is shown (Bunge-Funk 2006=2C Proposition 8.2.6) that=
=2C for any S-topos E there is a subtopos T(E) of M(E) that classifies the =
probability distributions on E. This means that for any E there is an equiv=
alence between the category of probability distributions on E and that geom=
etric morphisms E--> T(E) over S. The Dirac delta E--> M(E) is an S-essenti=
al geometric morphism so given by a 3-tuple of S-adjoints delta_! adj delta=
^* adj delta_*. T(E) is "simply" the subtopos of M(E) given by the least to=
pology forcing delta(1) --> 1 to be an isomorphism. There is also a constru=
ction of T(E) in terms of sites (Proposition 8.2.9=2C op.cit.)=A0

On the other hand=2C I know nothing about your comment
>(and so probabilistic computations can be captured as a=A0"computational e=
ffect").

so that=2C if such a preprint exists=2C I too would like to have it. I Will=
  ask Lawvere when (or if) I see him in a month unless he replies himself to=
  your query.

=A0
With best wishes=2C
Marta Bunge
