CFV'09:  Sixth International Workshop on Constraints in Formal
Verification

Grenoble, France, June 25, 2009.
A satellite event of the 21st International Conference on
Computer Aided Verification (CAV'09)

CFV'09 web site: http://www.miroslav-velev.com/cfv09.html

Abstract submission deadline:  April 15
Paper submission deadline:  April 22

Overview
---------------------------------------------
Formal verification is of crucial significance in the development of
hardware and software systems. In the last few years, tremendous
progress was made in both the speed and capacity of constraint
technology. Most notably, SAT solvers have become orders of magnitude
faster and capable of handling problems that are orders of magnitude
bigger, thus enabling the formal verification of more complex computer
systems. As a result, the formal verification of hardware and software
has become a promising area for research and industrial applications.
The main goals of the Constraints in Formal Verification workshop are
to bring together researchers from the CSP/SAT and the formal
verification communities, to describe new applications of constraint
technology to formal verification, to disseminate new challenging
problem instances, and to propose new dedicated algorithms for hard
formal verification problems.
This workshop will be of interest to researchers from both academia
and industry, working on constraints or on formal verification and
interested in the application of constraints to formal verification.

Scope
---------------------------------------------
The scope of the workshop includes topics related to the application
of constraint technology to formal verification, namely:
- application of constraint solvers to hardware verification;
- application of constraint solvers to software verification;
- dedicated solvers for formal verification problems;
- challenging formal verification problems.

Delivery
---------------------------------------------
The workshop is scheduled for June 25, 2009. It will be
structured to allow ample time for discussion and demonstration of new
tools and new problem instances.

Submissions
---------------------------------------------
Submissions should be in the LNCS format and in one of the following types:
- a regular paper of up to 15 pages;
- a short paper of up to 4 pages, describing an industrial experience.
Workshop papers should be submitted electronically in pdf format.
Papers should be formatted using the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) style.
Paper submissions should be e-mailed to the workshop chairs at:
mvelev-Re5JQEeQqe8AvxtiuMwx3w@public.gmane.org

Important Dates
---------------------------------------------
The important dates for the workshop are as follows:
- abstract submission deadline:  April 15
- paper submission deadline:  April 22
- notification of acceptance:  May 10
- camera-ready version deadline:  May 31
- workshop date:  June 25
