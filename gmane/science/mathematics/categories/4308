The uncountability argument mentioned by
Thomas does not apply because Colin's
Replacement axiom does not say that
"all" external families are representable,
only those definable by formulas.

Of course the statement is relatively
simple only when 1 separates, but that
is the case where much of the interest=20
in such axioms has concentrated:
categories of pure Cantorian cardinals.
Speculating about whether such principles
yield anything for the more cohesive
sets encountered in geometry and analysis,
it develops that, although specifying the
internal families is rather easy, explaining
which formulas define the appropriate
external families is not because of the=20
need to include functorality, sheaf=20
condition,etc.

Concerning the 70s work of Cole,Osius,etal,
they certainly constructed in lectures an
equivalence between the categories of models
of bZ and aETCS. Was it not published ?=20
(I don't recall any example showing=20
that the augmentation a was actually needed.)

The statement that Replacement
is weak seems to follow from using that word
to refer to classes derived from an already=20
representable V, rather than the traditional
meaning used by Colin, referring to arbitrary
formulas.
