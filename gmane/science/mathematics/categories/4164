                              D O M A I N S     IX

         University of Sussex, Brighton, 22-24 September 2008


INTRODUCTION

    The Workshop on Domains is aimed at computer scientists and
     mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
     foundations of computation. The workshop will focus on
     domains, their applications and related topics.  Previous meetings
     were held in Darmstadt (94,99,04), Braunschweig (96),
     Munich (97), Siegen (98), Birmingham (02) and Novosibirsk (07).

FORMAT

    The emphasis is on the exchange of ideas between participants
    similar in style to Dagstuhl seminars.  In particular, talks on
subjects
    presented at other conferences and workshops are acceptable.

INVITED SPEAKERS (confirmed)

    Jean Goubault-Larrecq   LSV/ENS Cachan & CNRS
    Martin Hyland		        Cambridge University
    John Longley			University of Edinburgh
    Andrew Pitts 			Cambridge University

   More invited speakers to be announced soon!

SCOPE

     Domain theory has had applications to programming language
     semantics and logics (lambda-calculus, PCF, LCF), recursion theory
     (Kleene-Kreisel countable functionals), general topology
     (injective spaces, function spaces, locally compact spaces, Stone
     duality), topological algebra (compact Hausdorff semilattices) and
     analysis (measure, integration, dynamical systems). Moreover,
     these applications are related - for example, Stone duality gives
     rise to a logic of observable properties of computational
     processes.

     As such, domain theory is highly interdisciplinary. Topics of
     interaction with domain theory for this workshop include, but are
     not limited to:

       program semantics
       program logics
       probabilistic computation
       exact computation over the real numbers
       lambda calculus
       games
       models of sequential computation
       constructive mathematics
       recursion theory
       realizability
       real analysis and computability
       topology, metric spaces and domains
       locale theory
       category theory
       topos theory
       type theory


SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS

     One-page abstracts need to be submitted to

                   domains9@sussex.ac.uk

     Shortly after an abstract is submitted (usually two or three
weeks),
     the authors will be notified by the programme committee. The
     criterion for acceptance is relevance to the meeting. In
     particular, talks on subjects presented at other conferences and
     workshops are acceptable.

DEADLINE

     Abstracts will be dealt with on a first-come/first-served basis.
     We expect potential speakers to express the intention to give
     a talk by the end of June.

REGISTRATION

     Further details about the local arrangements will be provided soon.

ACCOMMODATION

    The workshop will be held at the University of Sussex at Falmer,
    Brighton (UK). Newly built halls of residence will be available to
    workshop participants.   Further information on travel,
    accommodation and places of local interest will be announced
    closer to the workshop.

PROGRAMME COMMITTEE

     Martin Escardo    			University of Birmingham
     Achim Jung  				University of Birmingham  (Co-Chair)
     Klaus Keimel 			        TU Darmstadt   (Co-Chair)
     Bernhard Reus 			University of Sussex   (Co-Chair)
     Thomas Streicher 			TU Darmstadt

ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE

     Bernhard Reus    			University of Sussex

PUBLICATION

     We plan to publish proceedings of the workshop in a special
volume of
     a journal. There will be a call for papers after the workshop.
     The papers will be refereed according to normal publication
standards.
