i must be missing something.

what if A = {0,1}, B = {#}, R = {<0,#>} and S = {<1,#>}?

then A_0 = empty. (you don't say how to quantify over b; but since
there is just one b here, it doesn't matter)

on the other hand take the relation E \inc BxA where E = {<#,0>,<#,1>}

now E;R = E;S = id_B

but E does not factor through A_0.

what am i missing?
