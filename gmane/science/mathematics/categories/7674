Oops, forgot to say that furthermore, it should hold (for such a
category) that when the non vertices of the cospan are equal, the
"projections' in the commutative square can be taken to be equal.

yes !, a cofiltered category is just a connected such category,

Verdier's formulation, see Mac Lane's book if you don't like the SGA4.
