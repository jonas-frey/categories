===================================
CALL FOR PAPERS - CONCUR 2014
===================================

25th International Conference on Concurrency Theory
September 1-6, 2014 - Rome, Italy
http://concur2014.org

The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together researchers,
developers, and students in order to advance the theory of concurrency,
and promote its applications.


IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract Submission:    April 14, 2014
Paper Submission:    April 19, 2014
Paper Notification:    June  9,  2014


INVITED SPEAKERS

- Javier Esparza (TU Muenchen, DE)
- Jane Hillston (University of Edinburgh, UK)
- Catuscia Palamidessi (INRIA Saclay and LIX, FR), joint with TGC
- Vasco Vasconcelos (University of Lisbon, PT)


TOPICS

Submissions are solicited in semantics, logics, verification and
analysis of concurrent systems. The principal topics include (but are
not limited to):

- Basic models of concurrency such as abstract machines, domain
    theoretic models, game theoretic models, categorical models, process
    algebras, graph transformation systems, coalgebraic models and Petri
    nets;

- Logics for concurrency such as modal logics, probabilistic and
    stochastic logics, temporal logics, and resource logics;

- Models of specialized systems such as biology-inspired systems,
    circuits, hybrid systems, mobile and collaborative systems,
    multi-core processors, probabilistic systems, real-time systems,
    service-oriented computing, and synchronous systems;

- Verification and analysis techniques for concurrent systems such as
    abstract interpretation, atomicity checking, model checking, race
    detection, pre-order and equivalence checking, run-time
    verification, state-space exploration, static analysis, synthesis,
    testing, theorem proving, and type systems;

- Related programming models such as distributed, component-based,
    object-oriented, and web services;

- Security issues in concurrent systems.

===================================

PAPER SUBMISSION

CONCUR 2014 solicits high quality papers reporting research results
and/or experience reports related to the topics mentioned above. All
papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for
publication elsewhere. As an exception, concurrent submissions to
CONCUR 2014 and TGC 2014 are allowed, and in fact encouraged for those
paper that may potentially enhance both conferences. Authors of such
double submissions should identify them to the Program Chairs at the
time of submission (by choosing the "Regular paper submitted also to
TGC" category in the EasyChair site). Reviews may be shared between
CONCUR 2014 and TGC 2014. CONCUR's timeline is ahead of TGC's;
submissions accepted by CONCUR will be considered automatically
withdrawn from TGC.

Each paper will undergo a thorough review process. If necessary, the
paper may be supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will
be reviewed at the discretion of the program committee.

Contributions must be submitted as PDF files. They should  not
exceed 15 pages in length and comply the Springer LNCS style. Papers
should be submitted electronically using EasyChair online submission
system (https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=concur2014)

The CONCUR 2014 proceedings will be published by Springer in the
ArCoSS subseries of LNCS. The proceedings will be available at the
conference.
