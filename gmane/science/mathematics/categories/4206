                     Fourth Internation Workshop on
              Intuitionistic Modal Logic and Applications
                               (IMLA'08)

              (http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vdp/IMLA08.html)

                     A LICS'08 affiliated workshop
                Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, June 23, 2008


Constructive modal logics and type theories are of increasing foundational =
and practical relevance in computer science. Applications are in type disci=
plines for programming languages, and meta-logics for reasoning about a var=
iety of computational phenomena.

Theoretical and methodological issues center around the question of how the=
 proof-theoretic strengths of constructive logics can best be combined with=
 the model-theoretic strengths of modal logics. Practical issues center aro=
und the question which modal connectives with associated laws or proof rule=
s capture computational phenomena accurately and at the right level of abst=
raction.

This workshop will bring together designers, implementers, and users to dis=
cuss all aspects of intuitionistic modal logics and type theories.  Topics =
include, but are not limited to:

* applications of intuitionistic necessity and possibility
* monads and strong monads
* constructive belief logics and type theories
* applications of constructive modal logic and modal type theory to formal =
verification, foundations of security, abstract interpretation, and program=
 analysis and optimization
* modal types for integration of inductive and co-inductive types, higher-o=
rder abstract syntax, strong functional programming
* models of constructive modal logics such as algebraic, categorical, Kripk=
e, topological, and realizability interpretations
* notions of proof for constructive modal logics
* extraction of constraints or programs from modal proofs
* proof search methods for constructive modal logics and their implementati=
ons

The workshop continues a series of previous LICS-affiliated workshops, whic=
h were held as part of FLoC'99, Trento, Italy and of FLoC'02,
Copenhagen, Denmark.

We solicit submissions on work in progress and on more mature results. Subm=
issions should be extended abstracts of 5-10 pages sent in
PostScript or PDF format to the program co-chair at aleksn@microsoft.com.

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission: April 25, 2008
Notification: May 23, 2008
Final papers due: June 7, 2008
Workshop Date: June 23, 2008

It is planned to publish workshop proceedings as Electronic Notes in Theore=
tical Computer Science (ENTCS) or in CEURS, to be decided. Authors please u=
se the generic ENTCS macro package at http://www.math.tulane.edu/~entcs.
