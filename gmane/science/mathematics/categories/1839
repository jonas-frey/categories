	Charles Wells and Steve Vickers both made the point that, for
example, in a record of type (height in inches age, in years) you have to
be able to identify the height entry, and the age entry, but you do not
have to identify either one as the "first" entry or the "second". Yet, as
Charles points out, the usual ways of identifying the two entries all
carry a culturally-canonical ordering--as we say "one, two" usually in
that order and "left, right" most often in that order. As he puts it:

>>However, in practice the index set is {0,1}, {1,2} or {x,y} (the latter in
>>analytic geometry).  All of these are canonically totally ordered in our
>>culture, so inevitably binary products do have an order in practice.

	Then Vaughan Pratt weighs in, in his rhinocerean way. (For those
who do not read FOM, or at least Ionesco, Vaughan had a terrific post on
FOM about categorists as kind of rhinoceros, and by the end he began
transforming into one.)

	I think Charles is not tarred by this pit. 

	The Peano/ZFvN idea is to say that, given 0 and 1, and some one
among all the two-element sets is actually the set {0,1}.

	Charles is merely saying that when we pick a two element set, and
name its elements, we tend to use names with specific (helpful or
spurious) connotations.

	The naming here is "local", a choice of how to talk about two objects we
assme we have. It involves no idea that the two element set has any
objective features making it the set of 0 and 1.

best, Colin
