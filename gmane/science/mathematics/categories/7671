Hello,

I suppose that a span is a diagram of finitely many arrows of same domain=
=20
(or the op-situation). And the question concerns a name for categories with=
=20
co-cones over all such diagrams. I don't have a very poetic name for this.=
=20
At the moment I'm content with saying that such categories have V-cocones=
=20
(or V-cones) depending on directions. I've seen it being called the=20
"Amalgamation Property".

But as to what concerns the connection with the question of mixed=20
interchange of limits in Set, one needs to be very careful:

  If for some doctrine D one defines D-filtered categories to be categories=
=20
J such that J-colimits commute with D-limits in Set, then this terminology=
=20
will not do, since we then have.

1) If D is equalizers then D-filtered=3Dpseudofiltered. 2) If D is pullback=
s=20
then D-filtered=3Dpseudofiltered. 3) If D is pullbacks and terminal objects=
,=20
then D-filtered=3Dfiltered (and not proto-pseudofilterd as one could hope=
=20
for)


So one need to distinguish between three things:
1) having cocones over certain diagrams.
2) the categories of cocones over certain diagrams are connected.=20
3) commuting in Set with limits over certain diagrams.

What has been called "sound doctrines", are the doctrines such that 2) and=
=20
3) are equivalent.

As a short answer to the open question: If J is a sifted +=20
proto-pseudofiltered category, i.e sifted and span-directed then J is=20
pseudofiltered and connected and thus filtered. (since pseudofiltered=20
categories are categories with filtered connected components)

This kind of reflexions and more, with proofs, will soon be available via=
=20
my PhD thesis.

Best wishes,

Marie Bjerrum.
