Dear George,

I have not yet received the message you are referring to.

But I can reply to your question:
 >And do you, Marco, have a canonical connecting morphism?

The morphisms I was mentioning in 'my general lemma' are canonically
induced.
The connecting morphism of the Snake Lemma, or of the other Lemma,
are particular instances.

Best wishes

Marco
