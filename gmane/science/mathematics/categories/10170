Dear all,

In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the MIT Categories Seminar is going o=
nline.
From this week Thursday on, all the seminar talks will be held remotely, in=
  livestreaming on YouTube.
Not only will this be safer for everyone, but also more accessible for peop=
le across the world.

We will share a link to the streaming with anyone who is interested, via a =
dedicated mailing list.
There will be a chat room for questions during and shortly after the talk.
A permanent recording of the talk will then be available on YouTube for fut=
ure view, as it has been the case for many of the past talks.

The talks will take place on Thursdays, 12 noon EST (currently correspondin=
g to 4 pm UK time).

- Please contact me to be added to the mailing list, or to receive the stre=
aming link to a particular talk.
- Please contact me if you wish to be a speaker, or if you are one of the s=
cheduled future speakers.

Stay safe everyone.

Best,
Paolo Perrone (on behalf of the MIT Category Theory group)
