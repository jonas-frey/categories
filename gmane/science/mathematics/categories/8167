Jim Lambek was the founder of the Montreal school of category theory. =0A=
He made many foundamental contributions to algebra, category theory and cat=
egorical logic. =0A=
His paper on multicategories and deductive systems is marking the birth of =
linear logic.=0A=
Let me point out that his notion of muticategory is more general than that =
of operad introduced later by others. =0A=
I often use his elegant theorem on the initial algebra of an endofunctor. =
=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
I hope I can tell the story right: =0A=
Lambek immigrated from Germany to Canada just before WWII.  =0A=
During the war, he was put in a concentration camp by the Canadian gover=
nment =0A=
because he was German. But he was also a Jew. =0A=
He once told me that he began to learn mathematics in the camp.=0A=

I regret to inform you all that Jim died this afternoon.  His son says it=
=0A=
was congestive heart failure which is as good a way as any to describe=0A=
dying of old age.  He was still coming to seminar last fall and celebrated=
=0A=
his 91st birthday in December in pretty good shape, but has been gradually=
=0A=
going downhill since.  I don't believe he came to the office since late=0A=
fall.  He had a good run.=0A=
