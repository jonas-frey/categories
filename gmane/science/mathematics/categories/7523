I worked with Aurelio in Milan for a month, about twenty years ago. The
routine was that I would come in in the morning and try to understand what
he had told me the day before, he would come rushing in just before lunch,
we would go and eat, then do some work, go for an espresso, do more work,
then go for drinks and supper. The next day the same thing. His own
special method of proof is summed up in his phrase "What else could be?"
It worked well!

It was a wonderful time and I'm very sad I won't see him again.

Bob
