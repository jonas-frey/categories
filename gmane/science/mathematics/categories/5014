Let me second Paul's observation.  Going from the Yoneda lemma to a more
sophisticated version would be analogous to saying that the Fundamental
Theorem of calculus is "really" Stokes's theorem in its most general form
(that the integral of form over the boundary of an n-dimensional compact
region is the integral of the differential of the form over the region).
The point of fundamental theorems is that they are easy to state and
somehow capture something essential about the subject.  The original
Yoneda lemma states that all the properties of an object are present in
its homfunctor.  Thus objects are really captured by the morphisms.  That
it then leads to very sophisticated extensions is the point, but it, not
they, are the basis for it all.
