     2nd Workshop on MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->+*->

			     6 July 2008
			  Reykjavik, Iceland
		      co-located with ICALP 2008
			  http://msfp.org.uk

			Call for Participation
	     **early workshop registration ends 5 June**
	      registration via http://www.ru.is/icalp08/

The workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming is
devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of
remarkable power and abstraction. Monadic programming in Haskell is
the paradigmatic example, but there are many more mathematical
insights manifest in programs and in programming language design:
Freyd-categories in reactive programming, symbolic differentiation
yielding context structures, and comonadic presentations of dataflow,
to name but three. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek
to reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.
