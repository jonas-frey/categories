Dear Ronnie,

There are a number of "cubical" notions of bicategory or=20
higher in the literature with which I am sure you are=20
familiar; the earliest being Dominic Verity's double=20
bicategories (which are really a particular kind of triple=20
category), and later the weak (or pseudo) double categories=20
studied in a series of papers by Bob Par=E9 and Marco Grandis.=20
However, none of these quite seem to fit the spirit of what=20
you are asking for, and certainly do not describe the=20
singular cubical complex of a space.

One approach which is indicated in the literature is based on=20
Michael Batanin's theory of higher operads. In particular,=20
Tom Leinster, in the refined presentation of this theory=20
given in his book, discusses the possibility of using it to=20
give a notion of weak cubical omega-category, though he does=20
not go into any details. The basic idea is straightforward.=20
On the category of cubical sets (without diagonals or=20
symmetries) one has the monad T for strict cubical=20
omega-categories; and one aims to define the monad for weak=20
cubical omega-categories as a suitable deformation T' of this=20
monad. In the language of homotopy theory, one would like T'=20
to be a cofibrant replacement for T; this then ensures both=20
that T' looks sufficiently like T, and also that its algebras=20
are homotopy-invariant in a suitable sense.

To make this more formal, one defines a cubical operad to be=20
a monad S on the category of cubical sets together with a=20
cartesian monad morphism S =3D> T. The existence of such a=20
monad morphism---which I think will be unique if it=20
exists---places some strong restrictions on the shapes of the=20
operations out of which the monad S is built: a typical such=20
operation will take an n_1 x n_2 x ... x n_k grid of=20
k-dimensional hypercubes, and stick them together in some way=20
to yield a single k-dimensional hypercube. This is precisely=20
what one wants for a notion of (weak) cubical category.

To ensure that the monad S looks sufficiently like the monad=20
T, one needs the notion of a contraction (=3D acyclic=20
fibration). In fact, we only need to know how to say that the=20
monad morphism S =3D> T has a contraction, and this is quite=20
simple. Suppose we are given a n_1 x ... x n_k grid of=20
k-dimensional hypercubes as before. Suppose we are also given=20
operations s_1, ..., s_2k in S which indicate how to compose=20
up the (k-1)-dimensional grids of hypercubes obtained as the=20
faces of the original grid. Then we require that there should=20
be given an operation of S which acts on n_1 x ... x n_k=20
grids, and whose actions on each of the (k-1)-dimensional=20
faces are given by s_1, ..., s_2k.

There now arises a category whose objects are cubical operads=20
S equipped with a contraction on S =3D> T, and whose morphisms=20
are monad maps over T which commute to the contractions in=20
the obvious sense. This category is locally presentable, and=20
hence has an initial object; which we declare to be the monad=20
T' for weak cubical omega categories. One may in fact show=20
that T' is a cofibrant replacement for T in a suitable model=20
structure on cubical operads.

One may of course specialise this construction to low=20
dimensions, and I have just sat down to work it out in the=20
case where n=3D2. Rather surprisingly, it seems that there=20
might not be a finite axiomatisation of the resultant=20
structure; at least, one does not immediately leap off the=20
page which is the usual situation. The best I have been able=20
to do is the following (which is not exactly the result of=20
applying the above construction but is a perfectly good=20
surrogate).

Definition. A cubical bicategory is given by sets of objects,=20
of vertical arrows, of horizontal arrows and of squares,=20
satisfying the obvious source and target criteria, together=20
with operations of identity and binary composition for=20
vertical and horizontal arrows, satisfying no laws at all;=20
and finally, for every n x m grid of squares (where possibly=20
n or m are zero), and every way of composing up the=20
horizontal and vertical boundaries using the nullary and=20
binary compositions, a composite square with those=20
boundaries. The coherence axioms which this structure must=20
satisfy say that any two ways of composing up a diagram of=20
squares must give the same answer.

I would be very interested to know if anyone can extract from=20
this definition a finite collection of composition operations=20
on squares, and a finite collection of equations between=20
them, which together generate all the others. The key=20
obstable seems to be problem that identity 1-cells are not=20
strict in either direction.

Richard
