At the School of Computing of Newcastle University (UK), I am looking =
for a
postdoc to work on algorithms and techniques to support scalable
verification of hybrid systems. Candidates working on adjacent topics, =
which
contribute to the broad goal of ensuring safety of autonomous systems =
such
as synthesis of hybrid systems, are encouraged to apply as well. =
Interest in
investigating links between formal methods and areas of artificial
intelligence such as AI planning and verification of machine learning
algorithms is welcome.

More information is available at the following

Sharing and forwarding of this note is very much appreciated.

Thanks a lot, Sergiy
