                     GEOMETRY OF COMPUTATION 2006 (Geocal06)

                       Monday January 30 - Friday March 3
                       CIRM(1), Luminy, Marseille, France

                        http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/geocal06/

                        PREREGISTRATION WILL BE CLOSED ON
                            Sunday October 30th 2005

The session is organised by the GEOCAL(2) project and intends to gather
researchers interested in various topics of theoretical computer science
including logic, realisability, algorithmic complexity, semantics of
programming languages, algebraic methods for concurrency, probabilistic
transition systems, modelisation of biological networks...

The session will consist of a series of events: 4 winter school
lectures during the first 2 weeks followed by 9 thematic workshops.  A
detailed description including a provisional programme and the
preregistration form are available on the Geocal06 home page(3).

Participants will lodge at the CIRM(1). There is no registration fee but =
the
CIRM will charge about 65 euros a day for a full board stay. A number of
fundings for students will be available as well.

If you would like to participate to one ore more events, please fill
in the form before October 30th.  Note that there is a large but
finite number of places at the CIRM; in case we have too many
preregistrations for the same period, late ones will be canceled.
