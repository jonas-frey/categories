Dear Vaughan

A related question, originating with the problem of the quality of the
truth value space in M- sets, led me to the discovery of an equational
class that some years later, Peter Freyd rediscovered from an entirely
different point of view.

What is the Structure of the union of the "variety" groups with the
variety of commutative monoids ? The motivation was the common feature of
the Heyting algebra of right ideals of a monoid in either class, and the
partial answer is in my "Taking categories seriously", reprinted in TAC.

Not only do we have to think about the meaning of "union" and about the
analogy with closed subschemes (probably the source of the term "variety")
but also about the fact that the inclusion of groups in monoids is more
"open" than closed and is certainly not a (sub) variety even though both
categories are algebraic. Again analogously, the Structure 2-functor,
adjoint to Semantics does not carry full inclusions to surjective
interpretations, Thus in particular in my example like others, the
algebraic theory that results has more operations, not only more
equations. It may be true in your case as well.
