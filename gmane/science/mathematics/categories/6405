I am not sure why there is the restriction to having 2-categories as
edge arrows. They could be double categories, perhaps.  Would this then
be any more general than a 4-fold category?

A definition of n-fold category is given in

34.  (with P.J. HIGGINS), ``The equivalence of $\infty$-groupoids and
crossed  complexes'', {\em Cah. Top. G\'eom. Diff.} 22 (1981)
371-386.

and this also contains a definition of what was later called a globular
set, giving a notion of what we now call a strict globular n-category,
though the emphasis in the paper is on the groupoid case.
