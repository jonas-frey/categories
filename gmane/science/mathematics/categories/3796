Martin and all,

What I've done in the past is call the IEEE and talk to one of the
copyright people.  For conference proceedings, I've been told it's OK to
distribute and, as I recall, even to post the article as long as the IEEE
conference is cited.  I take the version that appears in the proceedings
and post that; it has the IEEE information toward the bottom of the title
page.  They would like you to call them first or notify them by mail of
what you want to do (some such statement used to appear on the electronic
copyright form---I haven't looked at the most recent one).

Regards,
Mike
