			June 25 - July 1, 2006
		       White Point, Nova Scotia

The organizers of CT2006 would like to remind prospective participants
that early booking of rooms at White Point Beach Resort is important
to ensure a good choice of room. Note that not all rooms are isomorphic;
there are single bedroom cabins (with ocean view or river view), shared
cabins, and hotel style rooms.

                     http://www.whitepoint.com/

Even more importantly, if early registration to the management of White
Point Beach Resort that this is going to be a small conference they will
adjust the size of the block booking downward accordingly. At the moment
we have potential access to most of the rooms at the resort, but this wil=
l
be reviewed at the end of the month. Please book your accommodation by
contacting White Point directly.

If you have not yet booked accommodation because you are uncertain of
whether you will be able to attend, please note that their cancellation
policy is extremely reasonable (a $5 administration fee for a timely
cancellation).

If for reasons of economy or sociability you wish to share
a multiple bedroom cottage but do not have a housemate lined up,

accomodation (with people from our conference).
