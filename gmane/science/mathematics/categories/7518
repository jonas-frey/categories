Dear Colleagues,

We are so very sad that Aurelio is so unexpectedly=20
gone. We will sorely miss his unique contributions to
our community.=20

It seems only yesterday (but actually it is 40 years)=20
since he, in Perugia, started to teach me his unique=20
Italian with the same enthusiasm that he applied to=20
learning category theory. I never ceased to admire=20
his quick grasp of mathematics, and his clear perception=20
of situations and characters.

My life (like the lives of many of us) was enriched
by his commentaries both wry and profound, yet=20
full of humor and kindness and warmth.

As all the friends, I am deeply distressed at saying=20
goodbye to Aurelio.


Bill=20
