Paul Taylor suggested that I post a personal account on what happened (and =
still happens) in Egypt. I was not sure this was appropriate for the List, =
but as he said, and since Bob (Rosebrugh) seemed to agree, if we look at Ca=
tegory Theory as a community, then why not. So here is my account, which I =
struggled to make as short as possible, but I found it hard to put a check =
on my enthusiasm.

The American University in Cairo is situated right in Tahrir (=3D Liberatio=
n) Square, where most of the action was concentrated over the three weeks o=
f what is now called here the "January 25th revolution". Actually my office=
  was overlooking the square. I am saying "was" because two years ago, to ou=
r chagrin, most of the AUC activities moved to the outskirt of Cairo in a n=
ewly built campus. The "Tahrir Campus" still exists, though, and you can se=
e its main (yellow, vaguely Islamic-style low) building on some of the foot=
ages of the events, for example the excellent summary (in three parts) prod=
uced by al-Jazeera:
http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/2011/02/201121310411102992.html
which I recommend if you want to visualize what happened from the Jan 25 to=
  the fall of Mubarak.

In any case I still live close to Tahrir, so that I could easily follow the=
  events and hop there from time to time. There was ample time to do that, a=
s classes were of course canceled, and that concentrating on the commutativ=
ity of diagrams was beyond me during such exciting time.

I am trying to summarize, but I have a more detailed daily account (in Fren=
ch) and some pictures for those interested. Just ask me.

It started with a few suicide attempts by fire (at least one died), from ab=
out a week before January 25th, in line with what happened in Tunisia (and =
led to Ben Ali's fall), together with small demonstrations of the usual sty=
le common at the time in Egypt: 50 activists closely surrounded by a couple=
  of thousands of anti-riot special forces, with lots of plain clothes polic=
emen in the vicinity. It HAD to be peaceful...

But on the 25th a very surprising thing happened. Mobilized entirely by Fac=
ebook-style tools, about twenty thousands people gathered in Tahrir to prot=
est, in particular against the police violence (this was the Police Day, an=
  official holiday to honor the police forces!), but also the recently rigge=
d elections, lack of freedom, etc. There was no identifiable leader, organi=
zation or plan. This unprecedented style of mobilization was to continue al=
l along the coming weeks, defying all predictions that such a lack of visib=
le leadership cannot lead anywhere. The achievements of what we simply call=
ed the "shebab" (the youths) are very clear and progressing little by littl=
e in the right direction to this day.
Anyway on the 25th the police forces where overwhelmed, tried initially to =
confront with relative moderation but were not able to stop the protests. P=
eople moved beyond the cordon, and occupied Tahrir. Much later the police b=
egan using full force and it became very tough there.
End of the first step. Nothing apparently achieved, but in fact a taboo was=
  broken!

  A similar event was "planned" (in the same way) for the next Friday (the f=
irst day of the week-end here). The government felt the danger this time an=
d had cut the internet and the mobile phone communications on Friday mornin=
g, but this did not succeed: after the mid-day prayer time, from everywhere=
  waves of people began to form and converge towards Tahrir square. This was=
  clearly to be violent, and me and my wife cautiously stayed home. We have =
no television, and with the other communications cut we could only follow w=
hat was happening from what we saw and heard from our 10th-floor terrace. A=
ctually we could easily follow the progression of the protestors. As they w=
ere violently clashing with the anti-riot forces, their chanting were spora=
dically mutating into chaotic roars, with noise of teargas canisters, shoot=
ings, water canons. Smoke and smell from burned tires or cars and of tearga=
s were everywhere. The protestors eventually reached Tahrir (where many wil=
l stay for the next two weeks!)

I'll skim through the too many exciting events which happened in the next t=
wo weeks.
The next day the police completely disappeared from the country!! The reaso=
n is still being investigated, but presumably it was to create chaos and fe=
ar. The army then moved their tanks around Tahrir but declared they would n=
ot attack the people. They are rather respected in Egypt, as opposed to the=
  reviled police. They remained in a fragile neutrality for several days, ev=
en when counter-protesters (many of whom clearly thugs paid by the police, =
or policemen themselves) attacked on February 2 and 3. This was extremely v=
iolent and hundreds died. At some point the pro-Mubaraks climbed on top of =
some buildings (including our university) to throw stones and fire bombs or=
  shot at people. After and before these very tough two days, Tahrir was lik=
e a fortress, inside which hundreds of thousands lived, chanted, discussed,=
  brought their family, took pictures of children on tanks, waved banners, o=
rganized cleaning, eat popcorn ... The most extraordinary melting pot of pe=
ople from all ways of life and political inclinations, with no conspicuous =
leadership but spontaneously very well-organized: for example you could not=
  access Tahrir without being searched by protestors posted between the tank=
s, to make sure no one brought weapons there.
The Cairenes who where scared where mainly the ones watching too much telev=
ision news; the antidote was to go to Tahrir and enjoy this extraordinary h=
appening.
Anyway, after a lot of suspense, on February 11 Mubarak finally left, leavi=
ng the power to a High Council of the Army. (Probably the latter pushed the=
  former out a bit...)
It happened just when I was entering home, in a rather depressed mood. An e=
x-colleague abroad quickly e-mailed me to congratulate and asked if I could=
  hear the Tahrir crowd cheering if I opened my window. I answered that even=
  hiding under the bed with earplugs I would hear it! The celebration went o=
n for the whole night and the next day there.

The romantic part is almost over now. Still, some generally peaceful, not t=
oo disruptive demonstrations continue, pushing each time the Army to keep t=
heir word and work hard on the process towards amending the constitution to=
  allow the formation of parties and elections, dismantling/reorganizing of =
the State Security, prosecution of the ministry of Interior and countless c=
orrupted officials, etc, etc. And little by little the shebab get what they=
  want: for example the Army had initially nominated an interim prime minist=
er that the protestors found too close to the ancient regime, and they obta=
ined, two days ago, his resignation and replacement by a more popular one. =
There will soon be a referendum on a list of proposed amendments on the con=
stitution, worked out by a team of independent experts. New parties, as wel=
l as new personalities willing to run for the presidency, are slowly emergi=
ng.

A lot of dangers lie ahead. Egypt, even if it completes its march to democr=
acy, will not be richer for that. The revolution has generated such hopes t=
hat one can expect deep frustrations sooner or later. And the sources of in=
ternational tension in the region will still be there, maybe more so from t=
he moment the people will have their say...

However what I have seen and continue to see so far from this people is so =
sustained, so extraordinary, so unexpected (by the Egyptians themselves) th=
at I feel optimistic.
It would be a miracle if everything goes smoothly for very long; but what w=
e have seen so far IS a miracle, so who knows...
