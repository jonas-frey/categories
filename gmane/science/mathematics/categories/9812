***********************************


Scope
-----

Studying logic via semantics is a well-established and very
active branch of mathematical logic with many applications in
computer science and elsewhere. The area is characterized by
results, tools and techniques stemming from various fields,
including universal algebra, topology, category theory, order,
and model theory. The programme of the conference TACL 2019 will
focus on three interconnecting mathematical themes central to the
semantic study of logic and their applications: topological,
algebraic, and categorical methods.

TACL 2019 is the ninth conference in the series Topology, Algebra
and Categories in Logic. The TACL summer school 2019 will be held
on the isle of Porquerolles during the week preceeding the
conference.
