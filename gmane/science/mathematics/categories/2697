Hi,

I was teaching some students recently that there are 2 kinds of inductive
definition of a set:

(a) By giving an "ambient" set A, and a family of relations A^{n}-->A.
This defines the least subset of A closed under all these relations, i.e.
the least prefixed point of the monotone endofunction on powerset(A)
mapping each subset B to the set of all elements related to B.

(b) By giving a signature.  This defines the initial algebra for (the
endofunctor on Set determined by) the signature.

I also wanted to treat the countably infinitary case, so (a) could allow
relations A^{omega}-->A, and (b) could allow operations of arity omega.
And I wanted to further generalize both (a) and (b) to the many-sorted
setting.  (Though in (a), the many-sorted situation can be reduced to the
single-sorted one by taking the sum of the ambient sets.)

-----------------------

I then proceeded to ask them: how do we know that (a) the least prefixed
point and (b) the initial algebra exist?

For (a) I gave 3 proofs:

(i) take the intersection of all such subsets of A

(ii) start from the empty set, and iteratively apply the monotone
endofunction on the powerset of A that maps C to the set of all elements
related to elements of C, taking unions at countable limit ordinals and
terminating at the first uncountable limit

(iii) take the set of elements of A for which there exists at least one
wellfounded prooftree.

For (b) I gave 2 proofs:

(i) start from the empty set, and iteratively apply the signature, taking
colimits at countable limit ordinals and terminating at the first
uncountable limit

(ii) take the set of all wellfounded operation-trees.

And all these 5 proofs adapt to the coinductive setting, except that
(a)(ii) and (b)(i) terminate already at omega.  However, coinduction was
not covered in the course.

---------------------------------------

I thought that (a)(iii) and (b)(ii) were actually the most important
constructions to teach the students, since they describe our basic
intuition.  But they require an appropriate definition of "tree".  In
(b)(ii), an operation-tree can be thought of a strategy for the following
game:

- Player picks an operation c_0 from the signature,

- Opponent picks an index i_0 in the arity of c_0

- Player picks an operation c_1 from the signature

etc.  And, as we know, there are several equivalent ways of defining
strategy.  I just picked one of them: a prefix-closed set sigma of
Opponent-awaiting plays

          c_0 i_0 c_1 i_1 ... c_n

subject (in this setting) to the constraint that any Player-awaiting play

          c_0 i_0 c_1 i_ 1 ... c_{n-1} i_{n-1}

which is consistent with sigma (i.e. every Opponent-awaiting prefix is in
sigma) has a unique one-place extension in sigma.  With this definition of
operation-tree, it was easy to complete proof (b)(ii).  And (a)(iii) is
similar, except that Player moves by supplying an operation together with
a tuple of A-elements.

My question is: where do these tree proofs appear in the literature?
Surely something so basic must appear somewhere?  The best I could find,
for (b), was to build a set of "terms" as a subset of an ambient set of
strings (they could be strings of operations, parentheses and commas, or
just strings of operations).  But it is quite unnecessary to use any
ambient set for (b), and, besides, that method would not work for the
infinitary or coinductive cases.
