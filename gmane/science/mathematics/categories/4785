10 PhD, PostDoc, and Engineering Positions offered!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| HATS: Highly Adaptable and Trustworthy Software using Formal Models |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

HATS is a new Integrated Project funded by the European Union, within the
programme "Future and Emerging Technologies" (FET) of the 7th Framework
Programme (subject to contract) starting March 2009.

The project partners from
   Chalmers Technical University, Gothenborg, Sweden
   University of Oslo, Norway
   Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden
   Technical University of Madrid, Spain
   IMDEA Software, Spain
   Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany,
   University of Bologna, Italy,
   Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI), Amsterdam, Netherlands
   Norwegian Computer Center, Oslo, Norway
   Fredhopper B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands
   Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental SE, Kaiserslautern, Germany,
   Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium
are jointly advertising several 3-5 year PhD, PostDoc, and Engineering
positions.

The goal of HATS is a tool-supported framework and formal methodology
for the development of long-lived and trustworthy software systems.
Specifically, HATS will turn software product family (SWPF) development
into a rigorous approach. The technical core of the project is an Abstract
Behavioral Specification language which will allow precise description
of SWPF features and components and their instances. For further
information see:

	            http://www.hats-project.eu

Topic areas: Applicants should have a background and/or interest in
one of the topics software modeling, modeling and programming
languages, formal methods, verification, language-based security, type
systems, or concurrency theory.

The following positions are offered:

* 2 PhD positions with emphasis on formal modeling and verification at
  Chalmers University of Technology. One of the positions is in the EU
  project CHARTER which is closely related to HATS. Application
  deadline is 9th February 2009. Contact: Prof. Reiner Haehnle. Further
  details and information on how to apply at
  http://www.chalmers.se/cse/EN/news/vacancies/positions/two-ph-d-student

* A Research Software Engineer at Fredhopper (Amsterdam).
  The position will comprise of industrial research on modeling and
  verification of key components of Fredhopper's flagship product within the
  EU-funded HATS research project.
  Fredhopper is the Nr. 1 provider of Search & Merchandising solutions for
  online business in Europe and industrial leader in the HATS project.
  Apply by 31 January 2009 for the most optimal procedure.
  Contact for project information: Dr. Nikolay Diakov.

* 2 PostDoc positions at the University of Bologna.  The emphasis is
   on  formal modeling and verification of the kind of concurrent systems
   studied in Hats using various techniques, including
   behavioural techniques and type systems.
   Application deadline is 31 January
  (later applications may also be taken into
  account).   Contact: Prof. Davide Sangiorgi, see:
  http://www.cs.unibo.it/~sangio/Hats/vacancies.txt

* 3 PhD positions with emphasis on static analysis and security at the
  Technical University of Madrid/IMDEA Software. One of the positions
  is in the DOVES Spanish project, which is closely related to
  HATS. The application deadline is 25 January. Later applications may
  also be taken into account if the positions are not
  covered. Contact: Prof. German Puebla. Further details and
  information on how to apply at
  http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Job_Openings/hats-doves-phd-grants.html

* 1 PhD and 1 PostDoc position in the area of software modeling and
  verification at the University of Kaiserslautern. The emphasis in
  the area of software modeling is on semantically founded integration
  of behavioral software models, feature-based descriptions of variability
  and programs. The emphasis in verification is on modular techniques for
  object-oriented models and model refinement. Application deadline
  is January 31. Later applications may also be taken into account.
  Contact: Prof. A. Poetzsch-Heffter. Further details and information
  on how to apply at http://softech.informatik.uni-kl.de/Homepage/OffeneStellen
