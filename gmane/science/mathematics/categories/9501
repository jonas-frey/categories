            26th Foundational Methods in Computer Science Workshop
                                             May 31-June 2, 2018
                                           Mount Allison University

Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop that brings =
together researchers in theoretical computer science and category theory. P=
ast workshops have had discussions on areas such as quantum programming lan=
guages, restriction categories, database design, and the differential and r=
esource logics. They have been held at Colgate, Dalhousie, Kananaskis (U of=
  Calgary), Mount Allison, Ottawa, UBC, Spokane, and Portland. The 2018 work=
shop is informal and interdisciplinary.

There will be an informal welcoming reception in the evening of May 30th. T=
he scientific program starts on May 31st, and consists of tutorials and con=
tributed talks. The meeting ends on the afternoon of June 2nd.

Confirmed tutorial speakers:

Kristine Bauer (Calgary)
Ernie Manes (Massachusetts)
Robert Pare (Dalhousie)
Peter Selinger (Dalhousie)

Note that the arrival day this year is Wednesday, and talks will end Saturd=
ay afternoon. Participants will have time to travel on Saturday either to H=
alifax for QPL and MFPS, or to Fredericton for the CMS meeting.

We particularly encourage graduate students to attend FMCS and to present t=
heir work.

Anyone interested in attending is kindly requested to notify Bob Rosebrugh =
(rrosebrugh@mta.ca). Please let us know by May 10th. If you wish to give a =
talk, please also send a title and short abstract. Some limited funding tow=
ard accommodation and travel expenses is available to support graduate stud=
ents who attend FMCS. To apply for this funding you should contact Geoff Cr=
uttwell (gcruttwell@mta.ca).
