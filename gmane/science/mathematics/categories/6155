   The parametrisation given corresponds to the symmetric placing of the
trefoil on a torus, the fact that you get the `lumps' is an artifact of
that.  The knot parametrisation can neatly `turned around' changing the
role of p and q. That is also a trefoil!

Have fun,
Take care.  Don't tie yourself in knots :-)
