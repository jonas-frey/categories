Yes, I remember this discussion. Actually my proof comes down to the
same fact since Q_n has homotopy type of unodered little cube
configurations in an n-cube. Lurie's proof is also based on the same fact.

Another approach to the proof that n-type with E_{n+2}-space structure
is also E_{infty}-space can be obtained by combining an idea of John
Baez and Jim Dolan of counting n-trees and my calculations of cells in
the Fulton-Macpherson operad. This is extremely simple combinatorial
proof. I can not reproduce it in this post because it requires some
pictures. But I remember, Andre, we discussed it with you in Montreal in
2004. I'll be happy to explain it again in Genoa.

The same for our proof. It does require a lot of homotopical algebra to
be able to localize model categories of operads.

I agree with it. It would be really wonderful if some experts organize a
   workshop on this subject with some introductory lectures for the
beginners.

So do I.
