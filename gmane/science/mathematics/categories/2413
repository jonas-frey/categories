   Fields Institute Program on Homotopy Theory and its Applications
                    University of Western Ontario
                           London, Ontario
                           September, 2003

WHAT'S NEW:

- The blocks at our hotels will be released on Tuesday, August 19, so
  book soon!
- The schedule has been set and is on the web page.

Details:

During the month of September, 2003, the Department of Mathematics at
the University of Western Ontario will host a program on homotopy
theory and its applications to other areas. Gunnar Carlsson, Paul
Goerss, Ieke Moerdijk, Jack Morava and Fabien Morel will be in
residence for parts of the month. All of the events will take place in
London, Ontario.

The focus of the month will be a special 5 day version of the Ontario
Topology Seminar, beginning on Saturday, September 20 at 9:30 am and
ending on Wednesday, September 24 at 4:30 pm. The speakers who have
agreed to come are listed below, and a detailed schedule is on the
web page.  This conference will take place at the London Delta
Armouries Hotel in downtown London.

In addition, there will be six minicourses at other times during the
month given by the five longer-term visitors. Each will consist of two
to three lectures. The schedule for these is also on the web page.
These courses will take place at the University of Western Ontario.

The organizers are Rick Jardine <jardine@uwo.ca> and Dan Christensen
<jdc@uwo.ca>. Please contact either one of us with any questions. If
you think you might attend, please register online or e-mail one of
us. There is no registration fee, but it is important for us to know
how many people plan to attend.

Hotel and travel information is available on the web page. We
recommend you book a hotel room right away, as the conference overlaps
with homecoming weekend at Western. We have two blocks which will be
released on *August 19*.

The conference is supported by the Fields Institute, the NSF, and
NSERC.
