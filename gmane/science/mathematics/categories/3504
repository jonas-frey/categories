CALL FOR TALKS AND PARTICIPATION

Universal Structures in Mathematics and Computing

http://usmc07.rsise.anu.edu.au

The Australian National University
Canberra, Australia
5 - 7 February 2007

Aim:

Starting from very different motivations, various groups of
mathematicians and computer scientists have sought to describe
abstract structures in great generality. This parallel evolutionary
process has led to various groups of researchers working on highly
interrelated areas, though unable to effectively communicate with
each other due to vastly differing languages.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers working in category
theory, universal algebra, logic and their applications to computer
science in order to highlight recent advances in these fields and to
facilitate dialogue between the different camps. Of particular
interest is work which spans two or more of these areas.

Structure and Scope:

The workshop will consist of several invited keynote talks as well as
shorter contributed talks. Topics of interest include (but are not
limited to):

* Operads and related structures
* Higher dimensional categories
* Coalgebras
* Clones in universal algebra
* Residuated lattices
* Algebraic logic
* Linear and other substructural logics
* Higher dimensional automata
* Concurrency theory
* Domain theory
* Type theory

Keynote Speakers:

   * Brian Davey (La Trobe, Australia)
   * Rob Goldblatt (VUW, New Zealand)
   * Ross Street (Macquarie, Australia)
   * Glynn Winskel (Cambridge, UK)

Talk submissions:

We solicit talks on topics related to the themes and spirit of the
workshop. We aim to facilitate all those who wish to speak at the
workshop. Submission of talks can be made by email to Alwen Tiu
(Alwen.Tiu@rsise.anu.edu.au) or Jon Cohen
(Jonathan.Cohen@rsise.anu.edu.au).

Registration:

Registration for the workshop can be done online through the workshop
website. The online registration will be opened on Friday, 15th
December 2006 until 2nd February 2007.

* Full registration:    AU$ 55 (incl. GST)
* Student registration: AU$ 35 (incl. GST)


Important Dates and Information:

* Deadline for registration: 2nd February 2007
* Deadline for talk titles and abstracts submission: 19th January 2007
* Workshop: 5 - 7 February 2007

Accommodation:

A limited number of rooms have been reserved at University House
(http://www.anu.edu.au/unihouse/) and Ursula College (http://
ursula.anu.edu.au/Ursula/12.html). Please quote the workshop name
"USMC workshop" when reserving the rooms.

In addition, there are many hotels and hostels for those wishing to
arrange their own accommodation. Locations in the city centre as well
as the suburbs of Turner and Braddon are within walking distance of
the university.
Details can be found at http://www.canberratourism.com.au/.

Sponsors:

The workshop is sponsored by the Australian Mathematical Sciences
Institute (AMSI) and National ICT Australia.


Travel support:

There are limited travel funds available to support students and
early-career researchers from AMSI members. Applications of funds
have to be made directly to AMSI. See http://www.amsi.org.au for
details.

Organising Committee:

   * Jonathan Cohen (ANU and NICTA)
   * Brian Davey (La Trobe)
   * Greg Restall (Melbourne)
   * Alwen Tiu (ANU and NICTA)
