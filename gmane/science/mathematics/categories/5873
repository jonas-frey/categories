Yes, Michael has said in several papers that his foundation would be
given in FOLDS.  And perhaps some specific version of the axioms has
been given in some paper that I have missed.  But I do not know of it;
and when Martin-L=F6f suggested last year that I might want to pursue a
type-theoretic foundation for category theory he did not mention
knowing of one existing yet.  So far as I know it remains a project.

best, Colin
