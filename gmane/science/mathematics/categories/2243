  [I thought it wise to share this announcement. -pjf]

In the 12 days from June 30th to July 11 2003, Montreal will be the
Categorization Capital of the Cognitive World.

The latest developments in all aspects of categorization will be
described and debated across the cognitive sciences spectrum:
cognitive anthropology, computer science, linguistics, cognitive
neuroscience, philosophy and psychology.

The University of Quebec/Montreal will host this Cognitive Sciences
Summer Institute.

A sample of only a few of the over 50 speakers. For the full programme:
