Dear category theorists,
I noticed recently that the category whose objects are categories with pullbacks and whose morphisms are pullback preserving functors is cartesian closed.  Given a pair of categories with pullbacks A and B, the internal hom [A,B] has objects: pullback preserving functors from A to B, and morphisms: cartesian natural transformations.
I have posted a short paper on the arxiv proving this fact:
http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2486
It seems like a fairly natural fact but is not to my knowledge in the literature.  I am wondering whether anyone was previously aware of this result, and if so whether it might  be mentioned somewhere in the literature?
Thanks,
John Bourke,
