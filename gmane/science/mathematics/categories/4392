Dear Michael,

I do not remember your original question, but here is an answer to this.
Let C be Cat^op and E be the arrow category 2.

It's easier to work in Cat itself. Then we are interested in the full
subcategory consisting of all categories X which admit a presentation=20

I.2 --> J.2 --> X
    --> =20

where I and J are sets, and "." is cotensor: e.g. J.2 denotes the=20
coproduct of J copies of 2.

But a category admits such a presentation if and only if it is free on=20
a graph, and the free categories are of course not closed under
coequalizers.

Steve.
