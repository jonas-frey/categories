**********************************************

Applications are invited for a 4 year fixed term RA position to work on =
the EPSRC funded grant "Logical Relations for Program Verification". =
Logical relations have been developed for core fragments of many modern =
programming languages and verification systems. But as languages and =
properties to be proved have become increasingly sophisticated and =
expressive, logical relations have struggled to keep pace. We aim to =
revolutionise the landscape of logical relations by providing framework =
for their development and use that is principled, conceptually simple, =
reusable, and uniform (rather than ad hoc). Our framework will be =
capable of both describing the wide array of logical relations already =
used in existing applications and prescribing new logical relations for =
future ones. It will be based on the mathematical concept of =
comprehension for a fibration. You will work with Dr Patricia Johann and =
Prof Neil Ghani who are the investigators on this project and also 2 of =
their PhD students working on similar topics. You will also work with =
project partners Prof A Simpson (Univ. Edinburgh), Dr R Atkey =
(Contemplate), Dr A Kennedy (Microsoft), Dr N Benton (Microsoft) and Dr =
C Schuermann (ITU Copenhagen).
As a Research Associate you will establish a personal research =
portfolio, plan research proposals, engage in relevant teaching, =
undertake professional and knowledge exchange activities, and input to =
administrative activities, with general support from senior colleagues. =
You will conduct individual and/or collaborative research, including =
determining appropriate research methods and contributing to the =
development of new research methods. You will write up research work for =
publication, individually or in collaboration with colleagues, and =
disseminate results as appropriate to the discipline by, for example, =
peer reviewed journal publications and presentation at conferences. You =
will join external networks to share information and ideas, inform the =
development of research objectives and identify potential sources of =
funding. You will also assist in the supervision of PhD students working =
on research related to the EPSRC grant.

You will be educated to a minimum of PhD level (or equivalent =
professional experience) in an appropriate discipline. You will have =
sufficient breadth or depth of knowledge in category theory, type theory =
and/or the semantics of programming languages. You will have a =
developing ability to conduct individual research work, to disseminate =
results and to prepare research papers and proposals and you will have =
an ability to plan and organise own workload effectively. You will have =
an ability to work within a team environment and you will have excellent =
interpersonal and communication skills, with the ability to listen, =
engage and persuade, and to present complex information in an accessible =
way to a range of audiences.
