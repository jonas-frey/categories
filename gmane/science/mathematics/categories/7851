Interesting and difficult question. Related to incompletness problems
and diagonal arguments.

Joyal considered arithmetic universes U (*), and an initial such U_0.
(for example, for U = Sets: U_0[1, N] = standard Natural Numbers).

Then show that within any arithmetic universe U you can construct
internally a U_0. In particular U_0 exist (called U'_0) inside U_0. You
have U[1, U'_0] = U_0. With this he proves Godel Incompletness.

(*) A pretopos U such that admits free monoids:
       X \in U, X ---> M(X), in particular, N = M(0).
(with this you have primitive recursive arithmetics and construct U_0).

I sort of remember also that Penon considered a topos object E' internal
to a topos E and such that E[1, E'] = E.

It is a challenge to to fill all the technical details and make rigorous
sense of all this.
