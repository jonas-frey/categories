Dear Colleagues:

The Jacobson radical that I have been mentioning in the last several =
communications, and which is defined in terms of the circle composition =
product x * y =3D x + y - xy, is related to category theory by M. W. =
Gray (Pacific Jour. Math 1967, vol. 23, 79-89 and her book A radical =
approach to algebra, Addison-Wesley: Reading, 1970.  In particular, the =
semiabelian category was introduced by her to include various of the =
radicals including the Jacobson radical.  A very accessible detailed =
presentation of her work and those of others up to 1994 is T. W. Palmer =
Banach algebras and the general theory of *-algebras volume I: algebras =
and Banach algebras, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, which is =
part of the exceptionally valuable Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Its =
Applications of the Cambridge University Press (not of course a usual =
encyclopedia - the name is used for numerous separate books of the =
highest quality on crucial mathematical subjects important in the latest =
rsearch).   See especially sections 4.3 and 4.7.

I will give more details on this at a future time.

Osher Doctorow
