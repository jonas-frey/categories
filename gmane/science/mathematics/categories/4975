Dear Makoto,

The Yoneda Lemma came to mind partly because of M. Barr and C. Wells book
"Toposes, Triples and Theories." Its Preface recounts that in the sense of
Lawvere's insight -- a mathematical theory corresponds "roughly to
the definition of a class
of mathematical objects" -- toposes, triples, and theories are
beautifully connected fundamental notions.

Barr-Wells write that the Yoneda Embeddings Theorem, "the first of
several important consequences" of the Yoneda Lemma, "in one way or
another is used in
practically every mathematical argument in this book." (p. 27)

Perhaps subscribers to this list would care to comment on how
specific results in this book apply or relate to computer science,
other areas of mathematics, logic, or physics.

All the best,
Ellis D. Cooper
