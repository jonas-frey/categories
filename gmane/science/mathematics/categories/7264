The workshop on formal topology is an international meeting dedicated
to formal topology and related topics, including constructive and
computable topology, point-free topology, and other generalizations of
topology.

This is the fourth of a series of successful meetings on the
development of Formal Topology and its connections with related
approaches. The first three have been held in Padua (1997), Venice
(2002), and Padua (2007).

The workshop is colocated with the Workshop on Higher Dimensional
Algebra, Categories and Types which will take place on June 20, 20012.
See the workshop website for details.
