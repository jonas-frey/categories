		           CALL FOR PAPERS

		    ACM SIGPLAN ASIAN Symposium on
Partial Evaluation and Semantics-Based Program Manipulation (ASIA-PEPM'02)
	             Aizu, JAPAN, September 12-14 2002
		      (co-located with FLOPS2002)
 	          http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/asia-pepm02

		   Submission deadline: 1st March 2002

The ASIA-PEPM'02 symposium will bring together researchers working in the
areas of semantics-based program manipulation, partial evaluation, and
program analysis. The symposium focuses on techniques, supporting
theory, and applications for the analysis and manipulation of programs.
Technical topics include, but are not limited to:

* Program manipulation techniques: transformation, specialization,
  normalization, reflection, rewriting, run-time code generation,
  multi-level programming.  

* Program analysis techniques: abstract interpretation, static
  analysis, binding-time analysis, type-based analysis.

* Related issues in language design and models of computation:
  imperative, functional, logical, constraint-based, object-oriented, 
  parallel, concurrent, secure, domain-specific. 

* Programs as data objects: staging, meta-programming, incremental
  computation, mobility, tools and techniques, prototyping and
  debugging. 

* Applications: systems programming, scientific computing, embedded
  systems, graphics, security, model checking, compiler
  generation, compiler optimization, decompilation. 

Original results that bear on these and related topics are solicited.
Papers investigating novel uses and applications of program
manipulation are especially encouraged.  Authors concerned about 
the appropriateness of a topic are welcome to consult with the 
program chair prior to submission.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Papers should be submitted electronically via the workshop's Web 
page. Exceptionally, submissions may be emailed to the program
chair: asiapepm@comp.nus.edu.sg. Acceptable formats are PostScript 
or PDF, viewable by gv.  Submissions should not exceed 5000 words, 
excluding bibliography and figures.

Submitted papers will be judged on the basis of significance,
relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. They should clearly
identify what has been accomplished and why it is significant. 
The work described should not have been previously published in 
a major forum. Authors must indicate if a closely related paper 
is also being considered for another conference or journal.

The proceeding of the symposium will be published by ACM Press.
A special issue of Higher-Order Symbolic Computation is also
planned.
