Just a few naive remarks about natural transformations and their two =
compositions.
I think comfortable to define natural transformations as functors, which =
is not the case, neither for the classical "object to arrow" nor for the =
"arrow to arrow" definition.
Now this can be achieved in two obviously equivalent ways.

In the following the letter I (though or because it is frequently used =
also to denote the unit interval) will picture the category denoted by 2 =
in CWM (just one arrow e going from the object 0 to the object 1) while =
QA will denote the category of commutative squares in the category A, =
endowed with the "horizontal" composition. (Note that the arrows of A =
may be described as functors from I to A and the arrows of QA as =
functors from the product category I x I to A).

Then the first definition is : a natural transformation between the =
categories A and B is nothing else than a functor from A to QB.=20
With this first definition, the vertical composition of natural =
transformations comes immediately from the "vertical" composition in QB =
(which is indeed a double category).

The secund definition (which is just a more symmetric reformulation of =
the "arrow to arrow" definition) seems to be less popular, though very =
useful in my opinion : a natural transformation between the categories A =
and B is also nothing else than a functor from the product category I x =
A to B.=20
This can also may be viewed as a functor from I x A to I x B, letting =
the first component be just the canonical projection from I x A to I.
Then the horizontal composition is just the composition of functors.

The latter definition is especially convenient when working with =
categories (or groupoids) in a category. For instance one knows =
immediately what is a smooth natural transformation (of course I is =
endowed with the discrete structure). It also allows to define =
immediately the horizontal composition for "higher order natural =
transformations", replacing I by its n'th power.
