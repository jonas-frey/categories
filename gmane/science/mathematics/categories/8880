is hosting the Foundational Methods in Computer Science workshop
on June 2-5, 2016, on the University of British Columbia
Campus in Vancouver, Canada

Registration

Deadline for early registration is May 2, 2016. To obtain a form send
email to johnm@math.ubc.ca with the heading "Registration".

Accommodations

To book accomodation go to the webpage

http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/160602-fmcs

Then go to accommodation section and click on the link "here". This opens
to UBC housing, then click on the Rooms and Suites link in upper left hand
corner. Then click on Budget Rooms in Shared Apartments to get the most popular

The workshop is an annual informal meeting intended to bring together
researchers in mathematics and computer science. There is a focus
on the application of category theory in computer science. However,
all those who are interested in category theory or computer science are
welcome to attend.

There will be a welcoming reception on Thursday June 2 in the Earth Sciences
Building on the UBC campus. The scientific program starts on June 3, and
consists of a day of tutorials aimed at graduate students and those new to the
field, as well as a day and a half of research talks. The meeting ends at 1pm
on Sunday June 5.

Research talks

There will be some invited presentations, but the majority of the
talks are solicited from the participants. If you wish to give a talk
please send a title and abstract to johnm@math.ubc.ca. Time slots are
limited, so please let me know before May 2, if you would like to be
considered for a talk.

Graduate student presentations are particularly encouraged at FMCS. There will
be a partial reimbursement of some accommodation expenses for some students
after the conference is over. For details see the webpage.
