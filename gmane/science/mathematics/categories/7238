As we know, a monad functor between two monads (possibly on different
categories) can be lifted to a functor between the algebra categories.

Fauser and I needed a corresponding 2-categorical result: a 2-monad
2-functor (of course, the natural transformation involved needs to be
2-natural) between two 2-monads (possibly on different 2-categories) can
be lifted to a 2-functor between the lax algebra 2-categories. Also the
lifting preserves pseudo-ness and strictness of the algebras.

We checked all the equations and it works, but we're not experts on the
2-categorical literature and we wonder if it's already known. Our first
literature searches haven't shown up anything - though even the
1-categorical case (which surely is well known) is elusive.

Has anyone seen this result before?

Steve Vickers.
