Many persons before me have talked about Jim as a mathematician, and of =
his important contributions in many domains of mathematics, there is not =
much I can add on this subject.

I met him for the first time in the winter of 1966-67. I was visiting =
Chicago for the academic year, and he invited me at Mac Gill for few =
days to give lectures at the category seminar. At that time he was =
already a well known mathematician with important contributions. But at =
that first meeting I discovered the man. A man with a vast culture in =
many non mathematical domains, a lot of personal charm, a big sense of =
humor, full of life and love of life.

I met him a countless number of times, in Montreal which I visited very =
often, in Paris where he attend my seminar and gave a few talks, and in =
many conferences, and my first impression was confirmed and deepened.=20

As all of us, I shall miss him.=
