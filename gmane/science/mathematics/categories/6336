Dear George=2C
>
Thanks for your interesting response. I contend=A0that "unramified covering=
s" is not an appropriate expression to describe those "coverings" not assoc=
iated with a Galois theory in your sense since there is a specific meaning =
attached to it. I would simply call them "generalized coverings". =A0Such w=
ould be the unramified coverings or just the complete spreads. In fact also=
  the branched coverings but there is a difference here. For branched coveri=
ngs=2C the motivation of it all=2C =A0a "branched Galois theory" already ex=
ists informally in the subject of knot groupoids. Moreover=2C =A0this examp=
le gives you the reason concerning coverings and Galois theories. =A0I devo=
te one paragraph to each contention.=A0
>
1. Terminology "unramified". When R.H.Fox introduced spreads and their comp=
letions=2C he had in mind what the title of his paper says=2C that is=2C "c=
overings with singularities" so=2C not the traditional locally constant cov=
erings. There could be "ramifications"=2C or branchings over points of the =
base.=A0But no folds. Specifically=2C he was thinking of branched coverings=
  =A0(branching over a knot in the base) as the spread completions of locall=
y constant coverings=2C in which branching points were added to the domain =
space. This is what led him to define a notion of spread=2C and then perfor=
m a completion process. The branched coverings=2C and more generally the co=
mplete spreads of which they are the motivating example=2C are "ramified". =
Now=2C add the condition that the complete spread (e.g. a branched covering=
) be a local homeomorphism. This does not force it to be locally constant=
=2C as we know=2C but it cannot then have ramifications. Hence the expressi=
on "unramified coverings". That is why I suggested "generalized coverings" =
- for both the ramified and the unramified which are not locally constant.=
=A0>
2. Do we need a generalized Galois theory to deal with the branched coverin=
gs? Perhaps but=2C if so=2C it would not be a big generalization. Indeed=2C=
  =A0the =A0"branched coverings"=2C which are very important in topology=2C =
although they do not correspond directly to any Galois theory in your sense=
=2C they do through a biequivalence. Indeed for a topos E (say)=2C there is=
  a biequivalence of the 2-categories of branched coverings of E branching o=
ver an object Y (the latter thought of as the complement of a knot K) =A0on=
  the one hand=2C and that of all locally constant coverings of the slice to=
pos E/Y on the other (Bunge-Niefield 2000=2C Funk 2000=2C Bunge-Lack 2003).=
  Now=2C C(E/Y) is in turn viewed as the knot groupoid G(K) of K. So=2C bran=
ched coverings branching over a knot is not an instance of coverings in you=
r sense as they are not locally constant=2C =A0yet there is a Galois theory=
  associated with them=2C however=2C only through a non-trivial equivalence.=
  A strange but not unmanageable situation.=A0
>=A0
With best regards=2C
