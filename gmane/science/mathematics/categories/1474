                            Local Transportation

>From the airport:
A taxi from the airport to either hotels or University will cost abou=

30. Alternatively you may take the train from the airport to the main=
 train
station - a 5 minute walk from the first two hotels. The ride will co=
st
around CHF 5 and will take 10 minutes. Purchase a ticket before board=
ing the
train.

>From hotels to the University:
It is a 10 minute walk from the first two hotels. You may cross the r=
iver
via either the Pont des Bergues or Pont de la Machine and then take R=
ue de
la Corraterie to Place Neuve. From the other hotel is a very short wa=
lk, see
the enclosed map. The University is located at the park called Promen=
ade des
Bastions.

By public transportation, take tramway number 13 from the main train =
station
to the fourth stop (called Plainpalais). From there walk by rue du Co=
nseil
G=E8n=E8ral until you reach the Promenade des Bastions.

ket in
advance at the machine located at the bus stop; the cost is CHF 2.20.=
 This
ticket is valid for one hour and you may take as many connections as =
you
want. Also note that the machine does not give change, and if you ent=
er a

pay a
fine of about CHF 100 and a visit to the police station.


                                  Cuisine

At ICALP '2000, luncheon will be served on the University campus to a=
ll

e

At other times, participants will have a broad choice of dining optio=
ns
offering international and gourmet fare all within walking distance o=
f
accommodations and many along the shores of Lake Geneva. The traditio=
nal and
most popular dishes among the local population are cheese fondue and
raclette, delicious local wines, and lake perch.


                         Currency and Credit Cards

The unit of currency is the Swiss franc (CHF). Notes are issued in
denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 1,000. Coins are issued in
denominations of 5, 10, and 20 centimes, and .5, 1, 2, and 5 Swiss fr=
ancs.
At the moment of the print, 1US was worth CHF 1.67, but since this ra=
te
changes very often, check the real rate at the necessary moment. Most
hotels, large stores, restaurants, and petrol stations accept all maj=
or
credit cards (American Express, MasterCard, Visa, Diners Club, Euroca=
rd).


                                  Location

Geneva is situated along the banks of Lac L=E9man (Lake Geneva) and L=
e Rh=F4ne.
The lake showcases the plumed fountain Jet d'Eau, and various distric=
ts of
Geneva are connected by bridges across the waterways. The University =
of
Geneva where ICALP '2000 will convene is located on the `Left Bank' o=
ff
Place Neuve and along the Promenade des Bastions near the Old Town se=
ction
of Geneva.

The two first ICALP designated hotels (Noga and du Midi) are located
lakeside - on the `Right Bank' - and are within walking distance of t=
he
University campus. It is a 10-15 minute walk which crosses through `O=
ld
Town'. Also, there is regular bus service running to the University, =
so
ICALP participants may come and go throughout the day. The Hotel Le G=
renil
and the University are both situated on the `Left Bank' and are very =
close.
Geneva is a city of water parks and gardens and welcoming walkways wh=
ich
encourage exploration of the historical sites, museums, and internati=
onal
business and shopping districts. The University of Geneva is located =
near
`Old Town' an area dotted with sidewalk cafes, student life, and buil=
ding
antiquities dating back to the 5th century.

Geneva is a crossroads situated in the heart of Europe and linked to =
the
world by a vast network of motorways, airlines and railways. For thos=
e
planning to attend ICALP'2000 in Geneva, it is an excellent opportuni=
ty to
organize short trips into the countryside of charming villages and
vineyards. Tours to please all ages and interests are available inclu=
ding
afternoon train excursions, shopping cruises on Lake Geneva and The R=
hone,
and bus and cablecar trips in the Alps.

For some, the most inviting attraction will be mountain climbing. The=
 high
mountains are situated less than half an hour drive from Geneva. In e=
arly
July, a very popular and almost mandatory activity is swimming in the=
 lake
Geneva, so serious and not so serious swimmers should plan accordingl=
y!


                                  Climate

The climate in early July should be warm but still very pleasant with=
 nice
evenings and breezes off the Lake. There may be showers but we can al=
so
expect sunny days.


                            Passports and Visas

A valid passport is required for entry into Switzerland. Some nationa=
ls may
also require a visa for Switzerland, and if you plan to visit France =
one may
be required there. Please check with your travel agent or consulate t=
o
determine whether a visa will be required.
