The Vienna Center for Logic and Algorithms of TU Wien (Vienna University =
of Technology), calls for the nomination of authors of outstanding =
theses and scientific works in the field of Logic and Computer Science, =
in the following two categories:

=3DOutstanding Master Thesis Award
=3DOutstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award (Bachelor thesis or =
equivalent, 1st cycle of the Bologna process)

----------------------------------The main areas of interest are: =
----------------------------------

*Computational Logic, covering theoretical and mathematical foundations =
such as proof theory, model theory, computability theory, Boolean =
satisfiability (SAT), QBF, constraint satisfaction, satisfiability =
modulo theories, automated deduction (resolution, refutation, theorem =
proving), non-classical logics (substructural logics, multi-valued =
logics, deontic logics, modal and temporal logics).

*Algorithms and Computational Complexity, including design and analysis =
of discrete algorithms, complexity analysis, algorithmic lower bounds, =
parameterized and exact algorithms, decomposition methods, approximation =
algorithms, randomized algorithms, algorithm engineering, as well as =
algorithmic game theory, computational social choice, parallel =
algorithms, graph drawing algorithms, and distributed algorithms.

*Databases and Artificial Intelligence, concerned with logical methods =
for modeling, storing, and drawing inferences from data and knowledge. =
This includes subjects like query languages based on logical concepts =
(Datalog, variants of SQL, XML, and SPARQL), novel database-theoretical =
methods (schema mappings, information extraction and integration), logic =
programming, knowledge representation and reasoning (ontologies, =
answer-set programming, belief change, inconsistency handling, =
argumentation, planning).

*Verification, concerned with logical methods and automated tools for =
reasoning about the behavior and correctness of complex state-based =
systems such as software and hardware designs as well as hybrid systems. =
This ranges from model checking, program analysis and abstraction to new =
interdisciplinary areas such as fault localization, program repair, =
program synthesis, and the analysis of biological systems.

*Formal Methods for Security and Privacy, covering design and analysis =
techniques for security and privacy critical systems, such as =
cryptographic protocols, software, hardware and so on. The category of =
formal methods is to be meant in a broad sense, including related =
questions in logic, model checking, static analysis, dynamic monitoring, =
theorem proving, and artificial intelligence.

----------------------------------In Memory of Helmut =
Veith----------------------------------
The award is dedicated to the memory of Helmut Veith, the brilliant =
computer scientist who tragically passed away in March 2016, and aims to =
carry on his commitment to promoting young talent and promising =
researchers in these areas.

----------------------------------Awards---------------------------------=
-

*The Outstanding Master Thesis Award:  1200 EUR=20

*The Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award: 800 EUR=20

*The winners will be invited to present their work at an award ceremony =
in Vienna.

----------------------------------Eligibility----------------------------=
------

*The degree must have been awarded between November 15th, 2018 and =
December 31st, 2019 (inclusive).
*Students who obtained their degree at TU Wien are not eligible.

----------------------------------Nomination =
Requirements----------------------------------

Nominations must include:

*A cover page that contains the name and contact details of the =
nominated person, the title of the work for which the person is being =
nominated, award category, the date on which the degree was awarded, and =
the name of the university=20

*An English summary of the thesis of maximum 3 pages, excluding =
references (A4 or letter page size, 11pt font min). The summary must =
clearly state the main contribution of the work, its novelty, and its =
relevance to some of the aforementioned areas of interest=20

*The CV of the nominated person, including publication list (if =
applicable=20

*An endorsement letter from a supervisor or another proposing person. =
The letter must clearly state the independent and novel contribution of =
the student, and why the proposer believes the student deserves the =
award. The endorsement letter may be provided after the submission =
deadline, and emailed directly to award (AT) logic-cs.at.

*The full thesis

All documents should be in English, with the exception of the thesis. In =
case the thesis is in a different language, it must be accompanied by a =
research report in English of at least 10 pages that should be =
sufficient for the committee to evaluate the merit and quality of the =
submitted work.

----------------------------------Instructions for submitting =
nominations----------------------------------

*Nominations should be submitted electronically using the following link =
to EasyChair here=20

*Submissions consist of two pdf files. The first is a single pdf file =
containing all documents for the nomination except the full thesis; the =
documents should appear in the order they are listed above. The second =
pdf file is the full thesis=20

*The endorsement letter may optionally be sent by email by the endorser =
and omitted from the Easychair submission. In this case, please email =
the letter as a pdf file, including the name of the nominated person in =
the subject, to award (AT) logic-cs DOT at=20

*The submission must be accompanied by a plain text electronic abstract =
of the thesis of at most 400 words, and three keywords.

*The nominated student must be listed as the first and corresponding =
author in the submission form.

----------------------------------Important =
dates----------------------------------

*Submission deadline (extended): April 9, 2020 (anywhere on Earth)=20

*Notification of decision: end of June 2020=20

*Award ceremony: TBA
