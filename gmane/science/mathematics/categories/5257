from Michael's message:

Dear Michael,

Does "formulate" mean "obtain/deduce"? Obtaining the curious sequence as a
consequence of the snake lemma is actually easy, and Saunders surely knew
it - which probably explains why did not he raise your question. Given your
f : A ---> B, h : B ---> C and g = hf, just apply the snake lemma to

    <1,f>         [f,-1]
A ---> A + B ---> B
 |              |              |
 | f            | g+1       | h
v             v             v
B ---> C + B ---> C
    <h,1>        [1,-h]

where + denotes the direct sum, <...> "uses" it as product, and [...] "uses"
it as coproduct (and use the fact that Ker(g) = Ker(g+1)).

However, this does not answer your original question of course.

George
