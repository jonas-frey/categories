Version 2.0 of Easik has been released. Easik is a Java application with a
graphical environment for database design, and data entry and manipulation
using Entity-Attribute (EA) sketches.

EA sketches are the syntactic basis for the categorical Sketch Data Model
which extends and enhances the standard Entity-Relationship-Attribute data
model.

In the graphical interface, Easik supports design of EA sketches and their
export to an SQL database schema. The exported schema has triggers and
procedures to enforce the graphically specified constraints. Easik also
provides connectivity to the common open-source database management
systems MySQL and PostgreSQL

Version 2.0 enhancements include:
- multiple sketch editing through an overview
- support for views (subject to SQL limitations)
- data entry and manipulation from the the graphical interface.

The application is available at

http://mathcs.mta.ca/research/rosebrugh/Easik

or follow the link from

http://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/

Downloads include:
- user instructions
- an executable Java archive (jar) file
- Java source code
- example designs

The contributors to Easik are Robert Fletcher, Kevin Green, Vera Ranieri,
Jason Rhinelander, Andrew Wood and Robert Rosebrugh with support from
NSERC Canada and Mount Allison University.

Extensive information about the Sketch Data Model is in articles available
from the web pages of the poster and Michael Johnson.

We look forward to receiving comments and reports from users.
