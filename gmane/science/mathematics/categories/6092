Hi David

The two categories involved are Pred([A]) and Pred([A A]), the
categories (perhaps preorders) of predicates over the contexts A and A
A in the contextual category of the logic (or in some semantic
interpretation of it).  The diagonal morphism [A] --> [A A] induces a
pullback functor \Delta^*: Pred([A A]) --> Pred([A]) which interprets
a predicate P(x,x') as a predicate with only one variable of type A by
duplication: P(x,x).  Its left adjoint \Delta_! interprets a predicate
of one variable as a predicate of two variables which is only true
when the two variables are equal, i.e. it adds x=3Dx' to the predicate.
I believe this adjunction was first noticed by Lawvere in "Equalities
in hyperdoctrines and comprehension schema as an adjoint functor."
