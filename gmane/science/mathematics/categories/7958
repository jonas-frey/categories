   18th European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software

                       Call for  Satellite Events


-- ABOUT ETAPS --

The European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
(ETAPS) is the primary European forum for academic and industrial
researchers working on topics relating to Software Science. ETAPS is
an annual event which takes place in Europe each spring since 1998.

The eighteenth conference, ETAPS 2015, will take place between April
11th and 19th, 2015 at Queen Mary University of London, in London,
United Kingdom.

London is one of the most visited and cosmopolitan cities on earth. It
is a leading global city, with strengths in the arts, commerce,
education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media,
professional services, research and development, tourism and transport
all contributing to its prominence. It can be reached by more people,
from more destinations, in less time, than any other destination in
the world.

ETAPS main conferences will take place on April 13th-17th, 2015. They
are:

   - CC: International Conference on Compiler Construction
   - ESOP: European Symposium on Programming
   - FASE: Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering
   - FOSSACS: Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures
   - POST: Principles of Security and Trust
   - TACAS: Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and
     Analysis of Systems


-- SATELLITE EVENTS --

The ETAPS 2015 organizing committee invites proposals for satellite
events (workshops etc.) that will complement the main
conferences. They should fall within the scope of ETAPS. This
encompasses all aspects of the system development process, including
specification, design, implementation, analysis and improvement, as
well as the languages, methodologies and tools which support these
activities, covering a spectrum from practically-motivated theory to
soundly-based practice. Satellite events provide an opportunity to
discuss and report on emerging research approaches and practical
experience relevant to theory and practice of software.

ETAPS 2015 satellite events will be held immediately before and after
the main conferences, on April 11th-12th and April 18th-19th, 2015.


-- ARRANGEMENTS FOR SATELLITE EVENTS --

The organizers of an ETAPS 2015 satellite are expected to:

   - create and maintain a website for the event,

   - form a PC, produce a call for papers for the event (if
     appropriate),

   - advertise the event through specialist mailing lists etc. to
     complement the publicity of ETAPS,

   - review the submissions received and make acceptance decisions,

   - prepare an informal (pre)proceedings for the event (if
     appropriate),

   - prepare the event's program complying with any scheduling
     constraints defined by the ETAPS 2015 organizing committee,

   - prepare and organize the publication of a formal (post)proceedings
     (if desired).

The ETAPS 2015 organizing committee will:

   - promote the event on the website and in the publicity material of
     ETAPS 2015

   - integrate the event's program into the overall program of the
     conference,

   - arrange registration for the event as a component of registration
     for ETAPS, collect a participation fee from the registrants,

   - produce a compilation USB memory stick of the informal
     (pre)proceedings of the satellite events of ETAPS 2015 and
     distribute this to the registrants,

   - provide the event with a meeting room of an appropriate size, A/V
     equipment, coffee breaks and possibly lunch(es).

As a rule, ETAPS will not contribute toward the travel or
accommodation costs of invited speakers or organizers of satellite
events.


-- SUBMISSION OF SATELLITE EVENT PROPOSALS --

Researchers and practitioners wishing to organize satellite events are
invited to submit proposals in plain text or pdf by e-mail to Paulo
Oliva  p.oliva@qmul.ac.uk).

A proposal should not exceed two pages and should include:

   - the name and acronym of the satellite event,

   - the names and contact information of the organizers,

   - the duration of the event: one or two days,

   - the preferred period: April 11-12th or April 18-19th,

   - a 120-word description of the event topic for the website and
     publicity material of ETAPS 2015,

   - a brief explanation of the event topic and its relevance to ETAPS

   - a tentative schedule for paper submission, notification of
     acceptance and final versions (the ETAPS 2015 organizing committee
     will need the final files for the local proceedings by March 13,
     2015),

   - the plans for formal publication (no formal publication, formal
     proceedings ready by the event, formal post-proceedings),

   - the expected number of participants,

   - any other relevant information, like event format, invited
     speakers, demo sessions, special space requirements, etc.

The proposals will be evaluated by the ETAPS 2015 organizing committee
on the basis of their assessed benefit for prospective participants of
ETAPS 2015. Prospective organizers may wish to consult the web pages
of previous satellite events as examples:
