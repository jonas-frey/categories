I do not do free work for journals published by publishers who make
enormous profits and pay nothing in return either to the authors or
reviewers.  In choosing to publish your proccedings in such a journal
rather than in the many journals that charge between 0 and and a tenth
what Elsevier does, you have chosen a path that ultimately would lead to
the destruction of scholarship.  It is insulting to ask me to cooperate in
such a venture.

Sincerely yours,

Michael Barr
