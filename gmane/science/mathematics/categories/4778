SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT OF CT2009 IN CAPE TOWN

Dear Colleagues,

Wishing you a Happy New Year, and we - the organizers of CT2009 - look
forward to seeing you in Cape Town:

Please could you confirm your attendance at the conference as soon as
possible and certainly before February 1 by answering the following
questions by email to registration@ct2009.info

1. Name, Address/Affiliation, Email Address?

(As you would like it to appear in the list of participants)

2. Arrival and Departure dates?

(There will be a reception on the evening of Sunday, June 28. The opening
and conference talks will begin at 9:00 on Monday, June 29. The conferenc=
e
will close at 13:00 on Saturday, July 4. However, we expect that Cape Tow=
n
with all its attractions will entice many participants to prolong their s=
tay
by either arriving early or staying on after the conference. In particula=
r,
depending on the weather, we plan to organize excursions on Table Mountai=
n
and/or Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope on Saturday, July 4, and on Sunda=
y,
July 5. And any additional information about your plans and wishes would =
be
helpful)

3. Would you like to give a talk?

(If yes, please submit your abstract before April 15. If you are familiar
with TeX please submit your abstract in the following form:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\def\references#1{\vspace*{5mm}\noindent{\sc References}\list
{[\arabic{enumi}]}{\settowidth\labelwidth{[#1]}\leftmargin\labelwidth

\bibitem{2} Reference 2

\end{references}

\bigskip\bigskip\noindent{\it Address/Affiliation\\ Email}
\end{document}

We hope that the selection process will end up with all submitted abstrac=
ts
accepted with enough time for everyone to give either a 30 min or a 15 mi=
n
talk. Accordingly, there will be up to three parallel sessions.)

4. Would you like to stay at a residence on campus?

(The preferred residence is the recently built Graca Machel Hall, normall=
y
used as a residence for female students. It has "clusters" of rooms: each
such cluster consists of two double rooms, four single rooms, shared
bathroom, and one or two shared toilets. The price per day per person sho=
uld
be 181 Rands (at today's exchange rate this is less than 14 Euros) + 37
Rands (less than 3 Euros) for breakfast. Walking from Graca Machel Hall t=
o
the conference venue will take about 15 minutes but there will also be a
shuttle bus. Our lunches will be organized at the University Club, but ot=
her
meals can be organized at Graca Machel Hall. A hotel would be more
comfortable of course, and Internet will show you infinitely many hotels =
and
small guest houses in Cape Town with infinite (but not below 500 Rands)
range of prices. The only problems with a hotel are: (a) higher prices; (=
b)
non-walking distances from the conference venue; (c) public transport is =
not
easily convenient. Those of you who prefer a hotel and do not intend to r=
ent
a car, might prefer to stay near the Waterfront (see
http://www.waterfront.co.za ), or near the city centre. The city centre i=
s
about 15 minutes by car from the University. If you choose to do this the=
n
further information on transport will be forthcoming)

5. Number of accompanying persons?

(And small children among them?)

The Conference Fee does not have to be paid by February, but it is:

Regular: 2250 Rands by April 15, or 3000 Rands after April 15;
Student: 1500 Rands by April 15, or 2000 Rands after April 15;
Accompanying person (if it is not a small child): 1200 Rands by April 15,=
 or
1600 Rands after April 15

The conference fee includes the cost of the Reception, Lunches, Conferenc=
e
Dinner, and Wednesday Excursion.
