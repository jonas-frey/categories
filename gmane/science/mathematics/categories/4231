Hi All,

Since we have a semantic characterisation of containers, we can look
at Thorstens question

Surely, it must be the case that all syntactically definable
endofunctors are accessible.

And, being syntactic constructions, I'd not be too surprised if they
preserved connected limits ...

Unless I've got the wrong end of the stick which is entirely possible.

All the best
Neil
