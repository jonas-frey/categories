          CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND CO-LOCATED EVENT PROPOSALS
                             ICFP 2013
  18th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
                      September 22 - 28, 2013
                       Boston, Massachusetts, USA
               http://icfpconference.org/icfp2013/

The 18th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
Programming will be held in Boston, Massachusetts on September 22-28,
2013.  ICFP provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear
about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and
uses of functional programming.

Proposals are invited for workshops (and other co-located events, such
as tutorials) to be affiliated with ICFP 2013 and sponsored by
SIGPLAN.  These events should be more informal and focused than ICFP
itself, include sessions that enable interaction among the attendees,
and foster the exchange of new ideas.  The preference is for one-day
events, but other schedules can also be considered.

The workshops are scheduled to occur on September 22-24 (the three
days before ICFP) and September 28 (the day after ICFP).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Submission details
  Deadline for submission:     December  7, 2012
  Notification of acceptance:  January   7, 2013

Prospective organizers of workshops or other co-located events are
invited to submit a completed workshop proposal form in plain text
format to the ICFP 2013 workshop co-chairs (Patrik Jansson and
Sam Tobin-Hochstadt), via email to icfp13-workshops@ccs.neu.edu
by December 7, 2012.  (For proposals of co-located events other
than workshops, please fill in the workshop proposal form and just
leave blank any sections that do not apply.)  Please note that this
is a firm deadline.

Organizers will be notified if their event proposal is accepted by
January 7, 2013, and if successful, depending on the event, they
will be asked to produce a final report after the event has taken
place that is suitable for publication in SIGPLAN Notices.

The proposal form is available at:
