I agree with John about the accepted meaning of "replete", but my
understanding of "skeletal" (supported by Mac Lane's "Categories
for the Working Mathematician") is that it means a category in which
every isomorphism class of objects has exactly one member. If I had
to find a word for a subcategory which meets every isomorphism
class of objects of the ambient category (but possibly in more than
one member) I'd call it "representative", or something like that.
A skeleton would then be a subcategory which is full, representative
and skeletal.

Regarding the question of whether such a subcategory is equivalent
to the ambient category, I recall that Peter Freyd once showed that
each of the following statements is equivalent to the axiom of choice:

(a) Every small category has a skeleton.

(b) A small category is equivalent to any of its skeletons.

(c) Any two skeletons of a given small category are isomorphic.

The first equivalence is trivial, but the other two require a bit of
ingenuity. I don't think he ever published this.
