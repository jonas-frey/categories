I agree with WHAT Yuri Ivanovitch Manin says about foundations of mathema=
tics
but DISagree when he calls these foundations "pragmatic". I might be mist=
aken
(in this case, I hope, Yuri Ivanovitch will correct me) but I don't think=
 that
in the given context the word "pragmatic" is supposed to be understood wi=
th a
philosophical seriousness. In the given context "pragmatic" is rather
synonymous to "practical" as opposed to "theoretical" - and perhaps also =
to
"purely mathematical" as opposed to "philosophical". I fully share with Y=
uri
Ivanovitch his disappointment about what he calls the "normative foundati=
ons
that logicists or constructivists tried to impose". But I see a solution =
in a
new dialectical philosophy of foundations (tightly connected to mathemati=
cal
practice), NOT in developing foundations purely "pragmatically" without
theoretical and philosophical grounds. The history teaches us that
philosophical thinking is crucial for what Yuri Ivanovitch calls the
"rebuilding" of foundations, and I don't see any reason why this might ce=
ase to
be true today.
On the contrary, I think that the acceleration of mathematical progress
necessitates the acceleration of rebuilding of foundations - and this mak=
es
philosophy more relevant to mathematical research than ever. "Logicists a=
nd
constructivists" don't have centuries to come to eternalise their finding=
s by
establishing a new Scholastic tradition in philosophy - even if some of t=
hem
would wish it.
