I regret to inform you that Bob Gordon died last weekend.
He had been diagonosed with cancer, a tumor on the aortic arch
which pressed on the lungs and trachea. He was in an excellent
cancer hospital near Philadelphia.

The chemo and radiation had been producing some improvement.
Up to last Saturday he was stable though very weak. Saturday
morning his blood pressure went up and his heart weakened.
Intensive care was able to stabilize him then suddenly his heart quit.

There is a memorial service Sunday July 1 at the Gordon home. If
you would like me to convey sympathy or relevant anecdotes to his wife
and daughters, just let me know.
