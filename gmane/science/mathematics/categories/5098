I have found nLab very helpful as well, for when I need to look up a=20
definition of some higher-categorical construction and I don't have a book=
=20
or paper on hand to refer to. I have thought many times, though, that it=20
would be great if there were some Web-accessible database of categories=20
which are commonly encountered in mathematics, and their properties; I=20
often find that I need to know if certain kinds of limits, or colimits, or=
=20
injective envelopes, etc. etc. etc. exist in a particular category, and=20
having some central database to look at (which would hopefully tell me=20
what I need to know as well as cite whatever paper the result was proved=20
in) would be a lot quicker than having to either search the literature for=
=20
such a result or try to re-prove the result myself. Does anyone know if=20
there have been any attempts to compile such a database?

Thanks,
Andrew S.
