I first encountered `cartesian' as a synonym for `having finite limits'
in Peter Freyd's unpublished `pamphlet' "On canonizing category theory;
or, on functorializing model theory" written in about 1975 (I may have
got the title wrong, since I no longer possess a copy). However, that
paper made it clear that the word was already in use as a synonym for
"having finite products"; in it, Peter argued that Descartes should be
given credit for having invented equalizers as well as cartesian products.
I suspect that its use to mean `having finite products' was a conscious
back-formation from `cartesian closed', which undoubtedly dates from
Eilenberg--Kelly 1965; but I don't know who first used it in this sense.

I did that because it seemed the appropriate convention to adopt in the
context of topos theory. I wasn't trying to dictate to the rest of the
world what the convention should be. On the other hand, there seem to
be remarkably few `naturally occurring' examples of locally cartesian
closed categories which lack terminal objects: the category of spaces
(or locales) and local homeomorphisms is almost the only one I can
think of.
