  There is an incorrect statement on pag. 303 of my paper =B3Logic in category
theory=B2 appeared in the volume Logic, Mathematics, Philosophy (DeVidi,
Hallett, Clark eds, 2011), where it is said that in 1979

  <<Robert Goldblatt=B9s lattice-theoretically oriented introduction, [22],
allowed
logicians to learn of semantics for first-order theories in toposes;
unfortunately,
adjoints only appear in Ch. 16 which was added to the 2nd (1984) edition,
and
play no role before this.>>.

My reference was to Goldblatt=B9s  Topoi. The Categorial Analysis of Logic an=
d
what I meant was that this book, which as a graduate I found helpful indeed=
,
made substantial use of adjoints within a categorical formulation of logic
in chapter 16 (added in the 1984 edition), whereas I knew that they were
already defined  in chapter 15 (which is the last chapter in the first
edition of the book, published in 1979) and used in the same chapter for th=
e
analysis of quantifiers. The need to be brief led me to a statement which
erroneously says that adjoints =B3appear=B2, i.e. are introduced in chapter 16:
adjoints were already introduced in chapter 15 where they obviously played =
a
role.  Thus the claim they =B3play no role before this=B2 is wrong at face
value, although their presence simply shifts to what was the <last> chapter
of the previous edition. As for what I referred to for =B3role=B2 , I intended
the role of adjoints in a fully axiomatic presentation of logic, which
actually is not made explicit until chapter 16.
