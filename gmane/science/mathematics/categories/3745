I'm usually too shy to post to the mailing list, so I wrote Bas Spitters
a personal reply instead.  In this case, though, I have to set the
record straight...

The category of operator _spaces_ admits a (non-trivial) involutive monoidal
structure---by which I mean a (non-commutative) monoidal structure together
with a _covariant_ involution that reverses the order of tensoring.
[Regarding a monoidal category as a one-object bicategory B, this means
that the involution relates B with B^{op} rather than with B^{co}.]
The tensor product is called the _Haagerup_ tensor product, and the
involution I considered is the so-called _opposite_ operator space
structure applied to the conjugate vector space.  I had conjectured that
involutive monoids in this involutive monoidal category (which, for the
purposes of this mail, I shall call involutive operator algebras) are
the same as C*-algebras, but eventually I discovered a counter-example
which showed that involutive operator algebras are strictly more general
than C*-algebras.  (This was the direction which had less concerned me!)
I apologise to anyone to whom I failed to mention this counter-example.

Cheers,
Jeff.
