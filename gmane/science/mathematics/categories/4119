We're hiring:

http://www.jobs.ac.uk/jobs/TN992/Lectureship_Senior_Lectureship_Readershi=
p/

There are three posts available, one in analysis and the other two in any
pure area (including category theory).  All are tenured.

For those unfamiliar with UK terminology, here's a brief explanation of
the job titles.  Someone with tenure is called a lecturer, senior
lecturer, reader or professor.  A lectureship is the most junior post (bu=
t
not like an American lectureship).  Senior lecturer and reader are
intermediate posts; SL is more oriented towards teaching, and reader
towards research.  There are rather few professors (maybe 20% of the
faculty), and it's perfectly normal to end one's career without ever
becoming one.

Feel free to get in touch if you have questions.  (I'll be away from my
mail for a few days.)

Tom
