Dear Michael,

Sorry to say, I have no time now - so, just briefly:

I know that "positive" is just an illusion and I only used it to make things
seem more obvious. Moreover, "fields" is also an illusion, since all the
rings involved are (quasi-) separable Q-algebras - and in fact one should
put things inside the dual category of G-sets, where, say, G is a finite
group that has a subgroup whose normalizer is a normal subgroup in G
different from G itself. This would imply that the phenomenon you were
looking for can even be found in a category dual to a Boolean topos.

However I still have to study what you say in the second paragraph of your
message...

Thank you for an interesting question-

George
