TYPES 2020 - Call for contributions


26th International Conference on Types for Proofs and Programs

2 - 5 March 2020, Turin

Web: https://types2020.di.unito.it/


Torino, Italy


BACKGROUND


The TYPES meetings are a forum to present new and on-going work in all

aspects of type theory and its applications, especially in formalised

and computer assisted reasoning and computer programming.


The TYPES areas of interest include, but are not limited to:


* foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics;

* applications of type theory;

* dependently typed programming;

* industrial uses of type theory technology;

* meta-theoretic studies of type systems;

* proof assistants and proof technology;

* automation in computer-assisted reasoning;

* links between type theory and functional programming;

* formalizing mathematics using type theory.


We encourage talks proposing new ways of applying type theory. In the

spirit of workshops, talks may be based on newly published papers,

work submitted for publication, but also work in progress.


The EUTypes Cost Action CA15123 (eutypes.cs.ru.nl) focuses on the same

research topics as TYPES and partially sponsors the TYPES Conference:

Part of the program is organised under the auspices of EUTypes.


INVITED SPEAKERS


* Sara Negri (University of Helsinki)

* Pierre Marie-P??drot (Inria Rennes-Bretagne-Atlantique)

* Ulrik Buchhotlz (Technische Universit??t Darmstadt)

* Leonardo de Moura (RISE-Microsoft Research)


CONTRIBUTED TALKS


We solicit contributed talks:


Selection of those will be based on extended abstracts/short papers of 2
pp (not including bibliography)

formatted with easychair.cls. The submission site is

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=types2020.


Important dates:


* abstract submission: 10 January 2020, anywhere on Earth

* notification of acceptance/rejection: 1 February 2020

* camera-ready version of abstract: 15 February 2020


Camera-ready versions of the accepted contributions will be published

in an informal book of abstracts for distribution at the workshop.



POST-PROCEEDINGS


Similarly to TYPES 2011 and TYPES 2013-2019, a post-proceedings volume
will be

published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics
(LIPIcs) series.

Submission to that volume will be open to everyone.
