Notice that I specified "in the model theoretic sense". In that context=2C =
the notions of a structure and of a morphism of structures are defined and =
it is that sense that I meant them. They are perfectly meaningful.=A0

I do not "subscribe" to these notions. I simply use the well-known notions =
from first-order logic and model theory as I said earlier. I am aware of th=
e difference between the locally connected =A0and the general case concerni=
ng covering projections and it is not the mathematics that I was disputing.=
  But I still have trouble following your analysis of this situation as was =
your purpose. The difference is that=2C whereas you consider the notion of =
a covering projection to be a property of a continuous map p from X to B wh=
ich=2C in the general (non locally connected case) is a "hidden structure"=
=2C I view the notion of a covering projection to be a structure in the fir=
st place and=2C in the specific locally connected case=2C one that may be e=
quivalently reduced to a property. Every property is a structure=2C but not=
  every structure is =A0reducible to a property.=A0
