We are having an Applied Category Theory special session of the AMS Fall

submitted through the AMS website.

You'll want to make reservations soon. Here are a few places people often
stay when visiting UCR.

Schedule and Location

We'll be able to figure out a schedule after we've decided who will be
speaking. The special session will be held on the UCR campus, though we
don't know the room or even the building yet.
