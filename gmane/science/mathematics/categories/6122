Dear Peter,

If I recall it right, string diagrams were first introduced
by Kelly and MacLane as a visual device for analysing
the structure of the arrows of a free monoidal closed category.
The device was not perfect but was giving some real insights.
Max Kelly showed later that it was a complete description in the =20
compact case.
I believe that Penrose was inspired by Feynman's diagrams
when he introduced his graphical tensor calculus (sometimes later).
I have first learned about Penrose's diagram from Max, in the late 70's.

One of the best way to learn something is to reinvent it.
Mathematics need to be constantly reinvented to stay alive and prosper.
Every new generation is reinventing mathematics.
Category theorists are permanently reinventing mathematics.

I guess we also need to remember the past.

Best,
andre
