Dear friends and colleagues of Mamuka Jibladze=2C



I have been told by several people that the link I gave before no longer wo=
rks.=20


This one was sent to me by T. Pirashvili and it was the first to reach some=
  of us.=20



http://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/2628_june_14_2012/2628_naec.html



We ought to be thinking of what action to take that might speed up the ongo=
ing investigation.=20


Mamuka vanished on June 11=2C five days ago!



Regards=2C


Marta
