There are a number of definitions of sketch around, some of which require
it to be a category with finite products.  In one of Ehresmann's (and
Bastiani's, I believe) there is mentioned the possibility of its being
what they called a quasicategory (or some such substructure term) in which
composition is a partly defined multi-ary operation (in other words, fgh
could be defined without fg or gh being defined).  Charles and I realized
that this was equivalent to what we called a graph with diagrams, which
seemed a more useable notion.  So what we called a sketch was a graph with
diagrams as well as certain cones and cocones that were singled out to be
taken to limits and colimits, resp.  Peter Johnstone criticized us for
doing the equivalent of replacing groups by generators and relations,
which is correct, but it was a conscious decision and there were reasons
for it.  I had never heard the term "idea" in this connection or we might
have used it.  But anyway, "sketch" is used in different ways and I guess
Charles and I contributed to this, but didn't create it.
