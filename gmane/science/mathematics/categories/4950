Limits, colimits, and adjoints:

I go along with this: it is the result of general category theory that I
have used most in studying colimits of forms of multiple groupoids, for
homotopical applications. It really does come under `categories for the
working mathematician'.

I have also been attracted in the same vein by fibrations and cofibrations
of categories: see a recent paper in TAC.

I well remember a remark of Henry Whitehead in response to a visiting
lecturer saying: `The proof is trivial.' JHCW: `It is the snobbishness of
the young to suppose that a theorem  is trivial because the proof is
trivial.'  (There  was and is no answer to that!) (His example was
Schroder-Bernstein.)

The leads to the interesting question of what makes a theorem nontrivial?
Good discussion topic for the young (at heart).
