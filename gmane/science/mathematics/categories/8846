        24th Workshop on Foundational Methods in Computer Science
                  University of British Columbia, VANCOUVER, Canada
                          JUNE 2 - 5, 2016

                                  * * *


The Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia
in cooperation with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences
is hosting the Foundational Methods in Computer Science workshop
on June 2-5, 2016, on the University of British Columbia
Campus in Vancouver, Canada

The webpage for the conference is

http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/160602-fmcs.


The workshop is an annual informal meeting intended to bring together
researchers in mathematics and computer science. There is a focus
on the application of category theory in computer science. However,
all those who are interested in category theory or computer science are
welcome to attend.

There will be a welcoming reception on Thursday June 2. The
scientific program starts on June 3, and consists of a day of
tutorials aimed at graduate students and those new to the field, as
well as a day and a half of research talks. The meeting ends at
1pm on Sunday June 5.

Research talks

There will be some invited presentations, but the majority of the
talks are solicited from the participants. If you wish to give a talk
please send a title and abstract to johnm@math.ubc.ca. Time slots are
limited, so please let me know before May 2, if you would like to be
considered for a talk.

Graduate student participation is particularly encouraged at FMCS.

Accommodations

Rooms may be reserved by clicking the link on the webpage. When you
reach the accommodation link, then click on the Rooms and Suites link
if you wish to access the lower cost accommodation available May-August,

registration is May 2, 2016. If you are planning to attend, and have not
already done so, then please send me email with the heading "Will attend".
