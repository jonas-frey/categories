Dear David,

of recent papers, there are for exemple

The

There is also a recent paper

K. Dosen, On Sets of Premises  (available at: http://arXiv.org)

As to the historical aspect, there was a theorem in an old paper by Gri=
gori Mints,
published in Russian in 1980
(reprinted in "Selected papers in Proof Theory", Bibliopolis, 1992), bu=
t I have
to find the paper and exact formulation of his theorem.

regards,

Sergei Soloviev

  certainly captures some, at least, of the natural transformations "mor=
e partial"  than their source functor, since there will be a zero natur=
al transformation between any two partial functors, corresponding to a =
"defined nowhere" partial natural transformation when zero-ness is inte=
rpreted as undefined as  it was in the correspondence between zero-pres=
erving functors from C~ to D~ and partial functors from C to D.

t seems to allow more partial natural transformations than Robin's obse=
rvation, since zero arrows can fill in whenever the image object under =
either the source or target functor is undefined, a partial natural tra=
nsformation to be a natural transformation between the restrictions of =
the two partial functors to the intersections of their domain of defini=
tion (or a subcategory thereof).
