AMAST promotes research that may lead to the setting of software
technology on a firm, mathematical basis. This goal is achieved by
a large international cooperation with contributions from both
academia and industry. AMAST 2004 will include keynote talks by leaders
in the fields of software/system correctness, software development,
including extensible and adaptive software, and evolutionary systems.
The main programme consists of presentations of refereed technical
papers on leading-edge research.

AMAST 2004 is co-located with
    MPC 2004 (Mathematics of Program Construction)
    ARTS 2004 (AMAST Real Time Workshop).
Participants for AMAST will be able to attend talks of both these
events for free (and vice versa).

AMAST 2004 is being held in Stirling, a historic city located in the
heart of Scotland. The conference venue and accommodation are all based
on the University campus, which is convenient for visiting the ancient
castle and Wallace monument, or for going further afield and exploring
the beautiful countryside. Social events include a civic reception, an
afternoon excursion to Loch Lomond, and dinner in a quaint Scottish village.
