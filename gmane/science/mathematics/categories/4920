Probably people are going to jump on me for saying this, but it seems to
me that category theory is different from much of mathematics in that
often the difficulty is in the definitions rather than the theorems, and
in the questions rather than the answers.  Thus, there are probably many
unsolved problems in category theory, but we don't know what they are
yet, because figuring out what they are is the main aspect of them
that is unsolved.  (-:
