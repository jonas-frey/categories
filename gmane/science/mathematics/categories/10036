*Lecturer Positions (Assistant Professorships) at the University of
Leicester*

Lecturer in Informatics / Computer Science (2 Posts)

University of Leicester

College of Science and Engineering

School of Informatics

Salary Grade 8 - ?40,322 to ?49,553 per annum

Closing date: *14 November 2019*


*About the School of Informatics*

Informatics is a School focussed on excellence in everything we do.
Working hard together, our ambitious staff and students work in
cooperation to deliver research, teaching and learning of the highest
quality. The School provides a rich and culturally diverse environment
where both students and staff can thrive in a demanding yet cooperative
and friendly atmosphere.

In research, the School?s vision is to conduct internationally-leading
discovery-led research in our research areas of core expertise in
Applied Algorithms and AI, Foundations of Computer Science, Interaction
Design and Evaluation of Socio-Technical Systems, Software Modelling and
Evolution and Verification and Validation. These areas support
interdisciplinary, applied and industrial research in the cross-cutting
theme of ?Data-Driven Application Engineering (DADA)?.

We also aim to apply the outcomes of our research to the benefit of the
economy and society. Under the overarching DADA theme, the School
currently prioritizes two cross-cutting research sub-themes, namely
Trustworthy and reliable autonomous systems and Biomedical informatics.
The school has research links with the Leicester Institute for Space and
Earth Observation and the Leicester Institute for Precision Medicine,
and is affiliated with the College of Science and Engineering?s Centre
for AI and Data Analytics.

The excellence of the School?s research has been confirmed in the last
two national research assessment exercises (in 2008 and 2014). In each
exercise, 95% of our research was judged to be of international quality,
65% was judged to be internationally leading, and over 20% of our
research outputs world-leading.

In teaching, we aim to deliver an outstanding student experience, with a
wide range of modern undergraduate and postgraduate programmes along
with doctoral research, all responsive to a competitive and rapidly
changing discipline. Our teaching is founded on strong pedagogical
principles, together with a unique approach to staff/student engagement
and active learning.

*About the Role*

We will consider all candidates whose research focuses on one or more of
the following areas:

- Cyber-physical systems
- Human Computer Interaction
- Machine Learning and AI
- Optimisation algorithms and Operations Research
- Software Engineering for Autonomous Systems
- Data Science

In this role you will conduct high-level research teaching whilst
generating funding through grants, consultancy and knowledge transfer
activities. You will give lectures, seminars and tutorials, especially
in areas across the School?s undergraduate and postgraduate curriculum.
Your research will result in significant contributions to papers in
leading international conferences and journals, whilst helping to build
your relationships with external partners to support knowledge transfer
and impact outside academia.

The main emphasis for selection will be on research excellence, but the
role also includes the development and delivery of excellent and
innovative teaching in the respective areas as well as contributions to
the administration and management of the School. You will work in a very
supportive environment with research and teaching mentoring. At the
heart of the UK, the University of Leicester is a research-intensive
university. Different areas of activity are balanced by a departmental
workload model to ensure fair and transparent balance between staff and
different areas of activity.

There are two full time, open ended positions available.

*About You*

In addition to being engaged in innovative learning and teaching that
engages and inspires students, you will already have an established
reputation for research, with a strong record of publications
(appropriate to your level of experience) in peer reviewed journals and
conferences of substantial international standing. You will have
excellent networking skills which you use to seek out opportunities for
collaboration and citizenship, both internally and externally. You will
also be able to demonstrate the ability to generate external funding
through research grants, contracts or other sources. Finally, you will
have a track record of engaging with a range of communities related to
your research and teaching interests, including external organisations
and companies.
