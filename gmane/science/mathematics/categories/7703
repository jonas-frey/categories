Professor in Mathematics with focus on Geometry

Deadline for application: August 15, 2013.

The Department of Mathematics at Stockholm University with its excellent =
research record and long lasting traditions has acquired a very special =
place in Scandinavian mathematics. Professors and lecturers working at =
the department possess competence in different areas of mathematics =
ranging from algebra, geometry and analysis to mathematical logic and =
combinatorics. Geometry with its central role in mathematics has shaped =
the department=92s profile and unites different research groups. We are =
looking for a mathematician with outstanding research record working in =
geometry in a broad sense.
