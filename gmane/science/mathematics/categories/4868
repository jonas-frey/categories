many thanks, Charles, somehow I forgot that the Elephant is also about Sk=
etches.
I came across this recent paper by Diskin&Wolter

http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zdiskin/Pubs/ACCAT-07.pdf

where the authors propose a version of sketch-based syntax for Computer S=
cience
purposes. The main idea here (as far as I understood the paper) is to use
sketches as arities of predicates. I heard about similar ideas from Rene
Guitart in private conversations (but Rene's approach is algebraic rather=
 than
logical). Looking at GBLS briefly I couldn't immediately grasp if your an=
d
Atish Bagchi's approach to graph-based logic is based on similar ideas or=
 your
approach is quite different. I certainly should read GBLS more carefully =
for
discussing it but I would grateful for a hint.
