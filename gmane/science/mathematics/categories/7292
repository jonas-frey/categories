It would not be good -- unless it was part of a longer sentence.

I wrote "Prior to encountering category theory, Bourbaki had a notion
of isomorphism but no general notion of morphism."  The Bourbaki
passage you quote was first published in 1957, at least 6 years after
Bourbaki encountered category theory as shown by the letter from Weil
that i quoted.
