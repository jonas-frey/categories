Sad, sad, sad news indeed.

I have to relay a story Alex told me not so many years ago when
we sat next to each other at a conference dinner.

I asked him about the last illness of Eilenberg, which was long
and difficult.  Alex visited him often, and after a stroke Sammy
could not talk.  On the last time he saw him, as Alex was getting
up to leave, he saw Sammy wanted something.  Then he realized he
wanted a farewell hug.  Anyone who remembers Sammy will recall
he was one of the world's prime skeptics and not much into hugging.
Alex gave him the hug, and just imagining the scene brings tears
to my eyes.
