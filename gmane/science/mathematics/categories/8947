Dear all,

I learnt years ago that the following definition gives an endofunctor D
on the category Rel of sets and relations.  But I have never seen a proof.

- For a set A, let DA be the set of discrete probability distributions
on A, i.e. functions from A to nonnegative reals whose sum is 1.  (Such
functions are necessarily countably supported.)

- For a relation R : A -> B, let DR : DA -> DB relate d in DA to d' in
DB when for every subset U of A, we have d(U) <= d'(R[U]), writing R[U]
for the set of all R-images of elements of U.  (It follows that for
every subset V of B, we have d'(V) <= d(R^c[V]), writing R^c for the
converse of R.)

To show D is a functor, the hard part is to show that, for relations R :
A --> B and S : B --> C, and d in DA and d'' in DC with (d,d'') in
D(S.R), there exists d' in DB such that (d,d') in DR and (d',d'') in DS.
I would like to see a proof of this.

It's the discrete case of Theorem 1 (i)=>(ii) in

https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aop/1176995659

where two proofs are mentioned.  Firstly, Nawrotski's, which is in
German, which I can't read:

Nawrotski K (1962) Eine Montonieeigenschaft zufaelliger Punktfolgen,
Math. Nachr. 24, pages 193-200.

Secondly, Strassen's:

https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177700153

which is in English but beyond my comprehension.  Strassen also cites
papers of Kellerer (in German) that might also contain a proof.

Can anyone give me a proof, please?

Two other things:

- For the subfunctor D_f of finitely supported distributions, the result
is easier.  It's the "splitting lemma" of probabilistic powerdomain
theory, and was proved by Jones, and later by Jung and Tix, and earlier
by Berge and dall'Aglio (cited by Strassen).  But these proofs (at
least, the ones I've seen) don't seem to adapt to the countably
supported case.

- I know that D, being an endofunctor on Set that preserves weak
pullbacks, has a unique extension to an endofunctor on Rel.  But that
doesn't help.

Regards,
Paul
