Hi Tom,

The category UNIF of uniform spaces, without a separation axiom, is
topological over sets, and hence complete and cocomplete, with concrete
limits and colimits.  UNIF=A0is not cartesian closed.

Cook and Fischer, Math. Ann. 173 (1967), 290-306, defined uniform converg=
ence
structures of a set X as sets \scrF of filters on XxX satisfying five
axioms.  With the obvious definition of uniform continuity, sets with a
uniform convergence structure in this sense form a topological category
over sets, but Gazik, Kent and Richardson in Bull.Austral.Math.soc 11 (19=
74),
413-424, showed that this category is not cartesian closed.

In LNM 378, 591-637, I replaced the Cook-Fischer axiom that the principal
filter generated by the diagonal of XxX is in \scrF by the less demanding
axion that the principal filter generated by (x,x), for every x \in X,
is in \scrF.  This is now part of the accepted definition of uniform
convergence spaces.  In Bull.Austral.Math.Soc. 15 (1976), 461-465 my
student R.S. Lee showed that the category of uniform convergence spaces
with this definition is cartesian closed; this is not the cartesian close=
d
hull of UNIF.

For quasitoposes, we must go to semiuniform spaces which have partial
morphisms -- relations (m,g) with m an embedding -- represented by
one-point extensions.  Semiuniform convergence spaces and their uniformly
continuous maps form a quasitopos, but not the quasitopos hull of UNIF.
This has been determined by Ad=E1mek and Reiterman, The quasitopos hull o=
f
the category of uniform spaes -- a correction, in the journal Topology
and its Applications.

For more information and literature, see my book Lecture Notes on Topoi
and Quasitopoi.
