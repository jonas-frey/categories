This is a purely terminological remark concerning the comments sent by =
Kirill Mackenzie about the response I made to Marco Mackaay's message =
("reference normal categorical subgroup ?", June 5). From these =
comments,  fully quoted below (though omitting the partial quotations =
from my own message of June 8), I extract the following two fragments :

<<Philip and I used the term `fibration' for what Jean calls =
an`extensor'>>

<<regular fibrations (=3D Jean's regular extensors) are precisely those =
in which the additional data can be deduced from the standard kernel and =
the base map>>

Indeed Kirill makes a double confusion (probably caused by the =
ellipticity of the redaction of my Note referenced below as [QGD]) about =
the meanings I attribute to the terms "extensor" and "regular".

As to the latter term, it has for me a purely smoothness meaning =
(referring to the fact that the equivalences on the manifolds have to be =
regular ones, and also that the anchor map of the kernel has to be a =
regular morphism, by which I mean composed of a surmersion and an =
embedding) and this term has to be dropped when dealing with the purely =
algebraic aspect of the question. In my paper referenced [MVF] I use =
instead (in view of more generality) the term "s-extensor", where the =
prefix  "s-" refers to the more general context of "diptych" data (in =
which goodepics/good monos generalize and replace surmersions/embeddings =
; see my previous message), and, in the algebraic context, has to be =
read as just meaning "surjective" ( but is then considered as implied by =
the very term "extensor").

On the opposite the term "extensor" has for me a purely algebraic =
meaning (more restrictive than what is called "fibration" in Kirill's =
message) and is equivalent to the notion of what is called "regular =
fibration" in Kirill's message (where here "regular" is given an =
algebraic meaning which I never used for myself !), and refers to the =
very simple case, alluded to in my own previous message, where one can =
mimic exactly the theory of group extensions or surjective group =
homomorphisms (with the only caution of using two-sided cosets). The =
suffix "or" is to remind that this a funct-or instead of a funct-ion. =
(In the absence at the present day of any response from Marco, I guess, =
without being sure, that he was probably interested mainly in this case, =
or perhaps in the still more special case when the kernel reduces to a =
sum of groups ). It should be noticed that the (rather obvious) examples =
given at the end of my Note emphasize the independance of the algebraic =
conditions (extensor) and the smoothness ones (regular), so that the =
ambiguity, if it existed, should be cleared up for the careful reader =
(in the last of these examples the underlying algebraic functor is just =
the identity, but not the identity for the underlying smooth =
structures).

The so-called "fibrations" were out of the scope of [QFD], which was =
centred on the smoothness questions and not on the (obvious in that =
special case) algebraic aspect, implicitely (and perhaps imprudently !) =
considered there as "well known".

However they are considered, and play a basic role, in [MVF] (p. 238 =A7 =
7) under the name of "(surjective) exactors" (explained below), but the =
general problem of quotients and generalized kernels in the sense =
described and referenced by Kirill (which is of course much more =
delicate than the algebraically obvious case of extensors) is completely =
out of the scope of this paper. The remark (ii) of this page 238 =
emphasizes the fact that "extensor" implies "surjective exactor".
=20
 Now it should be clear that when dealing with topological or smooth =
(i.e. Lie) groupoids, terms such as "(regular) fibrations" have to be =
definitely rejected, though previously used by various authors in the =
purely algebraic (or categorical) context, as giving rise to unsolvable =
ambiguities. (Note that there is a similar problem when using the =
widespread terminology "discrete" and "coarse" for groupoids ; though =
the ambiguity is  generally much less disastrous in that case, I think =
it much better to use respectively the terms "null" and "banal"). The =
reason is of course that these terms have very ancient (various !) =
meanings in Topology and Differential Geometry, which are not at all =
implied by (nor imply) the algebraic condition, nor by weaker =
topological or smoothness conditions such as (surjective) open maps or =
surmersions.
=20
I remind that unhappily the term "foncteur fibrant" was introduced very =
early by Grothendieck and his school, and is, I think, still used by =
most category theorists, concurrently with the term "fibration", which =
appeared, I think, a little later. Ronnie Brown used also sometimes the =
more suggestive and non ambiguous term "star-surjective", which might =
become "star-surmersive" in the smooth case (and perhaps something like =
"star-epic" in my more genaral dyptich framework, though I don't intend =
to use it).

The terminology proposed in [MVF] (to which I refer for more precision =
and details omitted here) comes from a general analysis of the =
properties of a functor f  between two groupoids, going from H to G =
(here we shall always assume below, to simplify, that f induces a =
surjective map for the bases, thus omitting as a consequence the word =
"surjective" in many occurences in what follows ; see [MVF] for more =
general and precise definitions and statements).  Forgetting for a while =
(to make the things simpler) the smoothness (or diptych) framework to =
consider solely the algebraic properties, I believe that the most =
important of these are reflected by the two commutative squares a(f) and =
t(f) built, from f, respectively with the domain maps and the anchor =
maps (of H and G), and more precisely by the properties of =
injectivity/surjectivity/bijectivity of the two canonical arrows =
(denoted below by u and w) going from H to the pull back's generated by =
these two squares. (My general guess and philosophy is then that the =
suitable corresponding notions in the smooth or more generally "diptych" =
case -see my previous message- are gotten by just replacing =
"injective/surjective/bijective" by "good mono/good epi/iso", and that =
as soon as one is able to describe the set theoretic algebraic =
definitions, constructions and proofs by means of diagrams, everything =
extends "almost automatically" to the structured case, using the =
Godement diptych axioms).=20

In that context the extensors are just defined very quickly by the =
surjectivity of w and the "exactors" (here always surjective)by the =
surjectivity of u ("star-surjectivity" in the sense of Ronnie). (Note =
that the bijectivity of w characterizes the surjective equivalences, =
which are special instances of extensors).

Now it turns out readily that the bijectivity of u characterize those =
functors which describe actions of the groupoid G on the base of H (H is =
then called the action groupoid in the literature, but I emphasize the =
fact that the action of G is not fully described by H alone, but by the =
functor f). For that reason I believe quite natural (though I don't seem =
to be followed) to call "(surjective) actors" the functors of this type =
(note that the classical terminology in categorical works is "discrete =
fibrations" (!),  "foncteurs d'hypermorphismes" (!!) in Ehresmann's =
book, and sometimes "star-bijective" for Ronnie Brown).=20
This explains (but perhaps does not justify) the above-mentioned term =
"exactor", with the suffix "or" as supra, and the prefix "ex" supposed =
to remind the surjectivity property of u (and not some terrorist or =
prejudicial activity) while evocating also some generalized kind of =
ex-tension.=20

The (surjective) actors and extensors appear as two opposite ways of =
degenerating for the (surjective) exactors, while the theory of  Kirill =
and Philip explains how these two special cases are mixed up in the =
general (more sophisticated) case.
There is also a very interesting special case of exactors described in =
[MVF] under the name of "subactors" (Prop.-Def. 7.5), which are the =
faithful ones. They make up a subcategory whose arrows admit a unique =
factorization through a surjective equivalence and an actor. (As a =
general remark all the purely algebraic underlying content of [MVF] may =
be considered as more or less easy or even trivial and or more (or less =
?) well known, but again the interesting point is that the rather easy =
set-theoretical proofs may be (with some care) written diagrammatically =
in order to be transferred to the smooth case via the diptych method).

In a secund part, I'll add some other terminological remarks about the =
terminology of "quotient groupoids" used by Kirill.

This is a comment on one aspect of Jean Pradines' very interesting
posting of June 8. I quote a large part of it for reference:

In response to Jean's paper

[QGD] Quotients de groupo=EFdes diff=E9rentiables, CRAS (Paris), t.303,
S=E9rie I, 1986, p.817-820.

Philip Higgins and I wrote two papers ([HM90a] and [HM90b] below)
dealing with general quotients of Lie (=3Ddifferentiable) groupoids
and Lie algebroids. Our starting point was the idea that:

``a morphism in a given category is entitled to be called a quotient
map if and only if it is entirely determined by data on the domain''

(Perhaps this will seem naive to true categorists, but I write as an
end user of category theory, not a developer.)

I would summarize [QGD] as proving that the `regular extensors' are
quotient maps in the category of Lie groupoids. [HM90b] then showed,
by extending the notion of kernel, that in fact all extensors are
quotient maps in the category of Lie groupoids.

Philip and I used the term `fibration' for what Jean calls an
`extensor'; these maps satisfy a natural smooth version of the
notion of `fibration of groupoids' introduced by Ronnie Brown
in 1970 (building on work of Frolich, I think). (Throughout this
post, I assume base maps to be surjective submersions.)

There is unlikely to be a more general class of quotient maps for
Lie groupoids: the fibration condition on a groupoid morphism
$F : G \to H$ is exactly what is needed to ensure that any product
in the codomain is determined by a product in the domain: given
elements $h, h'$ of $H$ which are composable, one wants to be able
to write $h =3D F(g)$ and $h' =3D F(g')$ in such as way that $gg'$ will
exist and determine $hh'$; the fibration condition is the weakest
simple condition which ensures this.

Fibrations of Lie groupoids are not determined by their kernel in
the usual sense (=3D union of the kernels of the maps of vertex
groups); one also requires the kernel pair of the base map, and the
action of this (considered as a Lie groupoid) on the manifold of
one--sided cosets of the domain. This data, which Philip and I
called a `kernel system' is equivalent to a suitably well--behaved
congruence on the domain groupoid. Though more complicated than the
usual notion of kernel, the notion of normal subgroupoid system
gives an exact extension of the `First Isomorphism Theorem'.

We also showed that regular fibrations (=3D Jean's regular extensors)
are precisely those in which the additional data can be deduced from
the standard kernel and the base map; in the regular case the two
step quotient can be reduced to a single quotient consisting of
double cosets (as Jean remarks in his post). The congruences
corresponding to regular fibrations are those which, regarded as
double groupoids, satisfy a double source condition.

A good example of a fibration which is not regular is the division
map $\delta: (g,h)\mapsto gh^{-1}$ in a group $G$, considered as a
groupoid morphism from the pair groupoid $G\times G$ to the group $G$.

All of this (for Lie algebroids, as well as for Lie groupoids and
for vector bundles) is in the two papers referenced below. There is
also a full account coming in my book `General Theory of Lie
groupoids and Lie algebroids' (CUP) which should be appearing
in the next few months.
