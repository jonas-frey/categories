Dear Andre,

Here's my own understanding of the history of AU definitions. Can you commen=
t on its accuracy?

1. You defined the initial AU, with a concrete construction, as sufficient s=
tructure to embody arithmetic. You also showed that the initial AU has an in=
ternal initial AU, and used that to establish the Goedel gap between truth (=
external) and provability (internal).

2. You and others also discussed what the general definition might be. I pic=
ked this up from Gavin Wraith in the 1990s. (I had first learned about AUs f=
rom Gavin's talk at the 1985 Surrey conference on Categories in Computer Sci=
ence.) Conceptually, it was "pretopos + free algebra constructions", but the=
  question was how to get a collection of primitive constructions sufficient t=
o get whatever else was needed. Gavin suggested free categories over directe=
d graphs and free category actions over graph actions.

3. Milly Maietti proposed parametrized list objects, and I am persuaded her a=
xiomatization is good. It is the one we used in our joint paper, and I used i=
n "Sketches for AUs". I believe it provides adequate foundations for my proo=
f with Palmgren of the existence of initial algebras for cartesian theories.=


All the best,

Steve.
