                 FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS: TAMC 2013
     The 10th annual conference on Theory and Applications of
                      Models of Computation

           University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong

Important Dates
Submission deadline : 11:59 pm EST January 11, 2013
Notification of authors : late February or early March, 2013
Final versions deadline : to be announced soon

The TAMC proceedings will be published in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science Series by Springer (http://www.springer.com/lncs).
Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work
at the conference.

Post Conference Publications
Special issues of the journals Theoretical Computer Science and
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science devoted to a
selected set of accepted papers of the conference are planned.

Aims and Scope

TAMC aims at bringing together a wide range of researchers with
interests in computational theory and applications. The main themes of
the conference are computability, complexity, and algorithms. Typical
       but not exclusive topics of interest include:

* algebraic computation
* algorithmic coding theory
* algorithmic number theory
* approximation algorithms
* automata theory
* circuit complexity
* computability
* computational biology, and biological computing
* computational complexity
* computational game theory
* computational logic
* computational geometry
* continuous and real computation
* cryptography
* data structures
* design and analysis of algorithms
* distributed algorithms
* fixed parameter tractability
* graph algorithms
* information and communication complexity
* learning theory
* natural computation
* network algorithms, networks in nature and society
* online algorithms
* optimization
* parallel algorithms
* privacy and security
* property testing
* proof complexity
* quantum computing
* randomness, pseudo-randomness
* randomized algorithms
* streaming algorithms
