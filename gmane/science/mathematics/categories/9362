Thanks, Gershom.

While Lawvere correctly points out that some try to misuse Godel's theorem,
I disagree with his *philosophical *perspective of the equivalence of
Cantor's diagonal argument and Godel's diagonal lemma.  The former does not
employ the use-mention distinction while the latter does.  This is what
gives rise to the "paradoxical" nature of Godel's theorem.  Please read
Quine's "The Ways of Paradox" for more.

Regardless, Lawvere's approach to Godel and Tarski provides an important
bridge between computer science and category theory.

Best,
BG
