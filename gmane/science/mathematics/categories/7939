JOURNAL OF LOGIC AND COMPUTATION

Special Issue on Logics for Resources, Processes, and Programs

AIMS AND SCOPE

We invite submissions to a Special Issue of the Journal of Logic and=20
Computation (JLC) devoted to the topic `Logics for Resources,
Processes, and Programs'. This call follows on from the LRPP 2013=20
workshop held in association with Tableaux 2013. This Call is open=20
to all interested authors, irrespective of attendance at LRPP 2013.=20

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the following:

- Logics for resources: semantics, model theory, and proof theory;
- Process calculi, concurrency, and resource-distribution;
- Reasoning about programs, systems, and behaviours (e.g., Separation=20
  Logic and associated ideas);
- Extensions of logics: for example, with modalities;
- Languages of assertions, and languages based on resource logics
  (e.g., query languages, pointers, trees, and graphs);
- Theorem proving and model checking in resource logics:
  decision procedures, strategies, complexity results;=20
- Applications to access control models in computer and system=20
  security.=20

We aim to identify and present a timely record of the leading =
contributions=20
to these logically rich and highly applicable topics in a rigorous logic =
journal.=20


SUBMISSIONS

Papers should be sent by email to either of the editors (Galmiche=20
or Pym, at their addresses as given below). Please use the=20
Subject line: JLC LRPP submission.=20

Papers should be prepared using LaTeX and, in the first instance,=20
submitted as pdf.=20

Submissions should present original work of the highest quality, not=20
previously published in, or submitted to, another journal. Each
submission will be considered by at least two reviewers and assessed=20
against the usual high standards of the JLC.=20

Please see http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org for guidance to authors=20
concerning submissions to the JLC.=20
