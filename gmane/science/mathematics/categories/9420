Dear Mike,

Thanks for the clarification, but the same comment applies: most higher-
order theories don't correspond to anything as simply described as a monad
(just as most first-order theories don't, but only the very special class
of algebraic theories). For first-order theories (including infinitary
ones) you have the notion of sketch, but that (unlike a monad) is still
presentation-dependent (i.e. it varies according to which parts of the
structure you're modelling you regard as primitive); if you want something
that doesn't depend on the presentation, you need to go all the way to the
syntactic category, which essentially consists of `everything that has to
be present in a category containing a model of the theory under
consideration' (just as a Lawvere theory contains all the operations which
have to be present in a model of an algebraic theory). Syntactic categories
can also be constructed for higher-order theories, and they are in fact
toposes; but they tend to be insanely complicated (even the free topos,
which corresponds to the empty theory, has an incredibly rich structure).
