Dear Paul,

Your question may turn out to be one of the most important questions in
the history of mathematics, when looking back at it in 2103 (= 2017 +
(2017 - 1931)).

A sibling question, therefore, and for me a more important one, is "What
else could we (= The Category Theory Community) do, having read the
proof?". I have no interest to deeply analyze WHY G??del did what he did,
even if I may be a bit curious about that as well. It relates to theatre
and stage, or drama and logic. As far as I can tell, even Shakespeare
did both. No, indeed not why, as I am more interested in how, and in
showing that we need types, not just to distinguish terms, but also to
distinguish sentences, and further to distinguish proofs from sentences,
and so on. Category theory embraces tools to do that. We have already
provided some first results in that direction. G??del didn't possess any
of those tools. Neither did Kleene. Nor did any of the two contribute to
creating those tools, I believe.

I raised the seemingly harmless and philosophical question about theorem
or paradox under this mailing list because I believe we [= The Category
Theory Community) can settle this thesis by means of mathematics and
category theory, and without philosophy, I would like to add, even if
philosophers are welcome to learn more about mathematics and category
theory in order to enrich their philosophical questions e.g. by the use
of enriched categories.

As you may have seen, I tend to believe that the thesis [G??del is wrong,
so Hilbert's question remains open] is _right_, and indeed that "[G??del
is wrong, so Hilbert's question remains open] is _right_" is well
decidable. The thesis is still an open question, i.e., the thesis in the
form presented here.

I wouldn't interpret non-reply to the sibling question "What else could
we do, having read the proof?" as a _good_ proof that "[G??del is wrong,
so Hilbert's question remains open] is _wrong_".

If it turns out that "[G??del is wrong, so Hilbert's question remains
open] is _right_", also in the sense that there is a majority in a most
important, well recognized and large mathematical community that agrees
upon that, then I will be happy to refer to you, Paul, and to your
question as having been the de facto starting point for the process
leading to this dramatic and logical solution.

On Friday the 13th, January, 2017,

Patrik
