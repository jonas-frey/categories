Dear Vaughan,

There's always a chance I'm wrong about Mostowski. I was going by a
mention in Lambek and Scott, but I'm not sure I tracked down the
reference. In any case, the technique is well developed. The details
in the Elephant are at pp.830-1. It's in sequent form, which allows
it to be applied to logics without implication as a connective.
However, with implication you can move everything to the right.

I looked at your article on the web. As I suspected, your treatment
of all variables, free or bound, as part of the context V loses
subtlety. An empty carrier is in effect treated as an inconsistent
object for the purposes of determining the semantics of any formula
with variables. For them FALSE and TRUE are identified, and so it is
impossible to discriminate between (exists) x. TRUE(x) (as false) and
(all) x. FALSE(x) (as vacuously true). To make that discrimination
you have to be able to work soundly with the empty context.

To put it bluntly, your idea of treating all variables as part of the
context works by saying FALSE is TRUE in the case of empty carriers.
I don't believe your proposed semantics is a satisfactory one.

You ask where a came from in something like (all) a. (exists) x. TRUE
(x). The answer is that it didn't, or not yet. It is symbolic of a
hypothetical element. In asserting the formula we say that _if_
someone brings us an a then we promise to deliver an x such that TRUE
(x) holds. Game theoretically we are safe whatever the carrier, since
our x can just be a. But in addition for the empty carrier we know we
will be undisturbed since no one will ever have an a to bring us.

Regards,

Steve.
