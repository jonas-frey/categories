Toby was of course referring to the Dedekind reals, but your binary
reals are not constructively either the Cantor or the Dedekind reals.
The reason is that you have to know in advance that a binary
sequence isn't going to end in an infinite string of 1's; by excluding
those sequences, you make the question "Is x < 1/2?" decidable,
which is not constructively true of either the Cantor reals or the
Dedekind reals.

I could take issue with you on this. If you insist that "constructive"
entails "predicative", then you are  of course right; but in a topos-
theoretic context, where you don't have countable choice automatically
available, it's very much the other way round.

No -- that's the whole point. In the topos of sheaves on R (better, in
the gros topos of sheaves on topological spaces) every function
R --> R is continuous, hence every function [0,1] --> 2 is constant.
