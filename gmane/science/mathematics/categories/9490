Dear Eduardo,

thanks for your attempts to clarify the situation!

I certainly did not incline this (despite my partial involvement into
HoTT :-))
I rather tacitly assumed that a locally U-small means that all homsets
are elements of U. This I find natural though I read that Grothendieck
and Verdier formulated it much more liberally.
However, using AC every locally U-small category is isomorphic to some
category where all hom-sets are elements of U. Moreover, every category
equivalent to such a category is locally U-small in the liberal sense
of Grothendieck and Verdier.

Now, for a category C which is locally U-small in the restricted sense
[C^op,U] is locally U-small in the restricted sense as shown by Paul's
argument.
But if C' is locally U-small in the liberal sense then [C'^op,U] \cong
[C^op,U] and the latter is locally U-small in the restricted sense and
thus [C'^op,U] is locally U-small in the liberal sense.

Thus, I think in SGA4 they made a mistake. No question that both guys
were great mathematicians but that doesn't prevent them from making
little mistakes in logic.

Thomas
