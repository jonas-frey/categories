Dear Colleagues,

I have not quite absorbed all the email on this yet, so may be =20
repeating something already said. But perhaps it would be helpful to =20
mention that, in regard to questions like this, I have found enriched =20
categories helpful:

consider either

1 the functor category [->,Set] (an object is a pair of sets X and Y =20
and a function from X to Y)

or

2 the category Sub(Set) (an object is a set X together with a subset =20
X', and a map from (X,X') to (Y,Y') is a function from X to Y for =20
which the image of X' lies in Y'

These categories, especially the first, both have the properties one =20
typically seeks for a V in studying V-categories.

Spelling out what a V-category is in the second case yields a category =20
C with a subcategory for which the inclusion is the identity on objects.

Happy New Year to all,

John.
