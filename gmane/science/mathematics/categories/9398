Dear George,


Although I have yet to read the Saunders MacLane's notes on "Geometrical Me=
chanics"  for a course given in Chicago in 1968 in some more detail, just p=
erusing them seems to me that the notes in question are based on several so=
urces which are explicitly mentioned in them and that are well known in the=
  subject matter. I doubt therefore that Saunders himself may have thought o=
f them as original in any way. Doubtless they must have been useful to his =
students as well as to himself, for instance when writing Chapter VIII (For=
ms of Space) and Chapter IX (Mechanics) of his very nice book "Mathematics =
Form and Function", Springer-Verlag, 1968.


I am still not sure myself whether to write "Mac Lane" or "MacLane", and I =
certainly did not know the story behind his opting for the latter. I am sur=
e that these notes will be useful to anybody not familiar with the material=
  exposed on them, and that we should certainly thank Harry Dole for his hav=
ing provided us with them.


Sincerely,

Marta

Dear Mr. Dole,

I am one of many who is (or will be) very grateful to you for these
beautiful notes. I have never seen them before. Do you know how accurate
they are? Had Mac Lane seen them?

While making a copy of them I read on your webpage:

"...Below are the lecture notes dating back to 1968. Interestingly, there=
=92s
no space in =93MacLane=94...

As a comment to that here is what Mac Lane says in his book "A Mathematical
Autobiography" (Page 6):

"...The space in Mac Lane was added years later by me, when my first wife,
Dorothy, found it difficult to type our name without a space".

Best regards,
George Janelidze
