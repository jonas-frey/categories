Dear All,

The following preprint is available from the Mathematics ArXiv at the
address http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3493:

O. Caramello, "A topos-theoretic approach to Stone-type dualities"

Abstract:

We present an abstract unifying framework for interpreting Stone-type
dualities; several known dualities are seen to be instances of just one
topos-theoretic phenomenon, and new dualities are introduced. In fact,
infinitely many new dualities between preordered structures and locales =
or
topological spaces can be generated through our topos-theoretic =
machinery in
a uniform way. We then apply our topos-theoretic interpretation to =
obtain
results connecting properties of preorders and properties of the
corresponding locales or topological spaces, and we establish =
adjunctions
between various kinds of categories as natural applications of our =
general
methodology. In the last part of the paper, we exploit the theory =
developed
in the previous parts to obtain a topos-theoretic interpretation of the
problem of finding explicit descriptions of models of 'ordered algebraic
theories' presented by generators and relations, and give several =
examples
which illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology. In passing, we
provide a number of other applications of our theory to Algebra, =
Topology
and Logic.

This work represents a concrete implementation of the abstract =
methodologies
introduced in the paper "The unification of Mathematics via Topos =
Theory",
which I advertised on this list some months ago; incidentally, some
subscribers to this list might be interested in the Russian translation =
of
the latter paper by Yury Bratkov, now available from the ArXiv at the
address http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0563.

Comments are welcome.

Best regards,
Olivia Caramello
