Dear colleagues,


This may be not be off-topic for some subscribers (e.g those interested=20
in categorical methods for CS): A permanent researcher position in=20
critical embedded systems engineering is opened at the Toulouse premises=20
of Onera. Please contact Virginie Wiels (research unit leader) for more=20
details (virginie.wiels [at] onera.fr). Lots of formal methods,=20
modelling, etc. on the meal; good experience in both theory *and*=20
practice are needed.


* Application through the web site
http://www.onera.fr/recrutement/index.php

* Job
Researcher - Permanent position

* Location
Toulouse, France

* Mission

You are part of the ISC (Ing=C3=A9nierie des syst=C3=A8mes critiques, Cri=
tical=20
Systems Engineering) Research Unit that is interested in how to ensure=20
correctness of critical embedded systems with respect to various kinds=20
of requirements (functional, safety, real time, security).

Your activity belongs to the Embedded Systems Engineering domain. The=20
goals of this domain are to define and implement approaches for the=20
design and verification of aerospace embedded systems.
You contribute to the design, modelling and formal assessment of=20
embedded architectures, taking into account real time, safety and=20
security constraints. The goal of this work is to propose solutions for=20
the design of distributed architectures and their formal verification=20
with respect to given properties.
Your work consists in:
- Studying new concepts of embedded distributed architectures ;
- Defining languages and methodologies dedicated to the considered=20
application domain and efficient for the targeted analyses ;
- Using and developing tools to support experimentation, modelling and=20
assessment ;
- Applying the proposed approaches on industrial case studies (in the=20
aerospace domain).

This work is done in the context of collaborative projects implying=20
industrial partners (Airbus, Thal=C3=A8s, Astrium, Rockwell Collins Franc=
e),=20
French and European research laboratories.

* Profile

Ph.D in computer science.
Expertise in modelling and analysis of embedded systems is necessary.
Knowledge in model driven engineering or architecture description=20
languages is appreciated.
Skills in prototyping and experimental framework development are welcome.

* Onera

Onera (Office National d=E2=80=99Etudes et Recherches A=C3=A9rospatiales)=
  is the=20
French national aerospace research center. It is a public research=20
establishment, with eight major facilities in France and about 2,000=20
employees, including 1,500 scientists, engineers and technicians. (More=20
