Dear Marta,

My reaction to the blog posts you cite is that this is a sting theorist
holding
his breath and refusing to learn category theory. My guess is that Motl
wouldn't
want to learn the heavily categorical formulations of mirror symmetry
that Yan
Soibelman uses, even though they are motivated by string theory.
Basically
categorical ideas aren't part of the standard bag of tricks physicists
use (even
though they often give much more elegant, concise, and insightful
formulations of some of those tricks), and the proverb about 'old dogs'
and
'new tricks' applies to physicists as well.

His attack on Baez is fairly standard stuff:  in the mode of "string
theory
is the theory of nature, so we don't want to think about alternatives
like
loop quantum gravity."  It is a polemical defense of a scientific
theory that
hasn't produced a testable prediction in the 40 plus years since its
inception,
and worse than that, unless one adds bells and whistles to fix it (in
the manner
of 'gaseous Vulcan' or Ptolemaic epicycles), predicts the existence
of a massless scalar field *not observed in nature*.  It really has
nothing at
all to say about category theory, which is after all a mathematical
theory
which stands irrespective of its extra-mathematical applications.

Categorical ideas are absolutely central to several competitors to
string theory:
the Barrett-Crane model of quantum gravity (and to a lesser
extent 'loop quantum gravity' with which the BC model is often
conflated)
and Connes' recovery of the Standard Model from non-commutative geometry
(a part of mathematics which has obliged reluctant mathematicians to
think about
categorical ideas deeper than they originally were comfortable with).
There is nothing
cracked or crackpot about either.

It is simply a fact we have to live with that our subject has found
legitimate uses
in physics, but uses which are unpopular with the dominant school of
physics in
the North America.  If (I suspect when) the string theory emperor turns
out
to have no clothes, category theory will suddenly become de rigeur in
physics.  (As it should, since categorical expressions of physical
ideas are the logical conclusion of 20th century physics drive to
express
everything in coordinate-free terms.)

Best Thoughts,
David Yetter
