What do you mean by an "external family"?  Do you mean every family that
the mathematician looking at the model from outside it would recognize,
or every family defined by a relation in the first-order language?

Are you just invoking the Skolem paradox in a categorical setting?

What is the axiom scheme "too strong" to do?

Before I can comment I have to ask, do you mean equivalence between
models, or between the categories of models?  Exactly what is it that
you want but feel that work does not prove?

Is it just that you prefer to think about a different question?  As
you put it:

You must use these words differently than I do.  We normally say every
topos is a model of intuitionistic set theory.  Many are not
well-pointed yet have no object of all sets.

Synthetic Differential Geometry (in the full, topos version, not
Synthetic Infinitesimal Analysis as in Bell's book) is one of the
best-known axiomatic extensions of the elementary topos axioms.  It has
no well-pointed models yet its usual models have no object U of all sets.

That is in an intuitionistic setting.  In classical logic, unbounded
replacement implies unbounded separation.  The "replacing set theory"
thread was about replacing ZFC, which has classical logic.

You cite the very nice work you have done Steve Awodey, Carsten Buts,
and Alex Simpson.  But that work does not aim (just) at axiomatizing the
classical universe of sets.  There are different questions here.
