****************************************************************
Midlands Graduate School in the Foundations of Computing Science
****************************************************************

                30th March - 3rd April 2009
                University of Leicester, UK
            http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/mgs2009

      The 10th Midlands Graduate School (MGS) is taking place!

WHAT IS MGS 2009?

The MGS is an intensive course of lectures on the Foundations
of Computing. It is very well established, with this being our 10th
anniversary, and has always proved a very popular and successful
event. This year we have Professor Peter Dybjer, Chalmers, Sweden, as
guest lecturer.

The lectures are aimed at graduate students, typically in their first
or second year of study for a PhD. However, the school is open to
anyone who is interested in learning more about mathematical computing
foundations. We very much welcome international applications as well
as from those from the UK.

FINANCIAL SUPPORT

We have 20 EPSRC funded places with substantially reduced fees.
