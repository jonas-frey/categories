                    CMCS 2010 First call for papers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tenth International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science
               26-28 March 2010, Paphos, Cyprus
                 (co-located with ETAPS 2010)
                  http://event.cwi.nl/cmcs10/

Aims and scope
------------------

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers with a common
interest in the theory of coalgebras and its applications.  Over the
last two decades, coalgebra has developed into a field of its own,
presenting a mathematical foundation for various kinds of dynamical
systems, infinite data structures, and logics.  Coalgebra has an ever
growing range of applications in and interactions with other fields
such as reactive and interactive system theory, object oriented and
concurrent programming, formal system specification, modal logic,
dynamical systems, control systems, category theory, algebra,
analysis, etc.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

  * the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
    approaches);
  * coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
    languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
  * coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
  * coalgebras and data types;
  * (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
    bisimulations or invariants);
  * coalgebras and algebras;
  * coalgebraic specification and verification;
  * coalgebras and (modal) logic;
  * coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid
    systems).


An anniversary: the 10th CMCS
----------------------------------------

CMCS took place for the first time when ETAPS started, in 1998.  Since
then, it has always been collocated with ETAPS, becoming bi-annual
since the start of CALCO (Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra) in
2005.

In 2010, we will celebrate the 10th edition of CMCS,
by inviting a number of specialists in the field to present overviews
of both obtained results and future challenges.

Invited Speakers
---------------------

At this tenth meeting the following invited speakers will present
overviews of important subareas.

  * Venanzio Capretta: Coalgebra in functional programming and type theory
  * Bartek Klin: Operational semantics coalgebraically
  * Dirk Pattinson: Logic and coalgebra
  * Ana Sokolova: Probabilistic systems coalgebraically


Submissions
--------------

There are two types of submissions possible:

(a) Papers to be evaluated by the PC for publication in the proceedings:

 They must have a length no greater than 20 pages.  They must contain
 original contributions, be clearly written, and include appropriate
 reference to and comparison with related work.  Accepted papers will
 appear in ENTCS (style files can be found in http://www.entcs.org/).
 The web-based system EasyChair will be used for submission
 (http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcs10).

 After the event, a special journal issue of selected papers will be
 considered.

(b) Short contributions:

 These will not be published in the proceedings but will be bundled in
 a CWI technical report.

 They should be no more than two pages and may describe work in
 progress, summarise work submitted to a conference or workshop
 elsewhere, or in some other way appeal to the CMCS audience.  For
 short submissions, the style file easychair.cls should be used
 (http://www.easychair.org/coolnews.cgi).  The submission (pdf file)
 is via email: cmcs10@cwi.nl.
