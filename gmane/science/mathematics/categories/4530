Disinformation is *deliberate* false information, false information
*intended* to mislead.  As I understand it, Bill's statement says,
among other things, that disinformation often appears on the
n-Category Cafe.

I don't know whether Bill really meant to say this.  I very much hope
not.  I can't think of a single instance where someone at the
n-Category Cafe has intended to mislead.

Best wishes,
Tom
