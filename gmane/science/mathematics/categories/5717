Dear David,

I don't know the full answer, but here are some thoughts.

Let I be the (localic) compact real interval [0,1]. I is locally compact
and so for any locale X the locale exponential X^I exists and is the loca=
le
of paths in X. The endpoints of I give two maps d0 and d1: X^I -> X and w=
e
have the groupoid operations in the obvious way. (For composition this
needs that I is a pushout of two copies of itself, glued end to end. This
is not obvious, but I believe I once proved it to myself and perhaps it i=
s
known anyway. Exponentiation then transforms that pushout into a pullback=
,
showing that X^I is in fact homeomorphic to the locale of composable pair=
s
of paths.)

The groupoid laws cannot hold until we have factored out homotopy, which
must therefore be the next step. If gamma and delta are two paths agreein=
g
at the endpoints, then a homotopy from gamma to delta, relative to the
endpoints, can be expressed as a map D -> X where D is the closed Euclide=
an
2-ball (a closed disc). This uses two maps I -> D, taking I to the upper
and lower half boundaries of D, and giving two maps du and dl: X^D -> X^I=
.
Hence the fundamental groupoid Pi_1(X) should be the coequalizer of du an=
d
dl.

It's not obvious to me that the path composition can be transferred to th=
at
coequalizer. I think we would like the coequalizer to be stable under
pullback, but that is not always true for locales. Perhaps it is in this
case.

Once the groupoid operations have been established on the coequalizer, I
conjecture it's not going to be too hard to prove the groupoid laws, usin=
g
the usual constructions of homotopy theory.

Regards,

Steve Vickers.
