Two comments on Peter's posting.  First the particular example he mentions
was apparently first discovered by a French mathematician named Batbedat.
Second, there is an example of an infinitary theory whose category of
algebras is equivalent to the category of sets!  Simply take the
underlying functor to sets represented by an infinite set and prove it is
tripleable using Beck's PTT (very easy).  The theory has as n-ary
operations all functions X --> X^n where X is the representing set.
