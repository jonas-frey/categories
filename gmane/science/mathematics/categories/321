BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT

Semantics and Logics of Computation

Edited by

Andrew M Pitts
University of Cambridge

and

P Dybjer
Chalmers University

The aim of this volume is to present modern developments in semantics
and logics of computation in a way that is accessible to graduate
students. The book is based on a summer school at the Isaac Newton
Institute and consists of a sequence of linked lecture courses. The
authors are leaders in their fields and much of material they present
was either not previously accessible, or not accessible in such a
digestible form.
