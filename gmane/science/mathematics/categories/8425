Another suggestion regarding Dee Roytenberg's request for

>> ... a good text on the subject [Applications of (higher) =

>> category theory to computer science]? ...
  =

in addition to =


> Category Theory applied to Computation and Control, ... 1974, ... :

there's also perhaps David Spivak's very 21st century Category Theory for=

the Sciences, ISBN 978-0-262-02813-4, MIT Press, 2014. Very little actual=

category theory, apart from definitions, examples and illustrations, but =

it's exactly those examples and illustrations (taken from computer scienc=
e, =

from sociology, from physics, from biology, from operations research, etc=
=2E) =

that may be what the OP is seeking.

Be aware that, in this book's presentation, Yoneda's Lemma finally turns =

up somewhat past page 400 (of 486 pp. total), and, for its proof (which I=

guess lies beyond the scope of Spivak's book), the reader is referred =

to Mac Lane's Categories for the Working Mathematician :-) .

Cheers, -- Fred
