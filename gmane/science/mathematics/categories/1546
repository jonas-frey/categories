At this point, I think your best bet is to get a copy of Bart Jacobs
excellent book "Categorical Logic and Type Theory" - which (in spite
of its title?) is all about fibrations (and logic and type theory -
actually I think it is well-titled, though you might not have guessed
it was what you needed from the title).  (There is a review of this
book on my web page, link below.)
