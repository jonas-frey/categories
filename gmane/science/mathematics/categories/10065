A while back, I constructed a webpage linking to online materials on =
category theory at an introductory/middling  level, including lecture =
notes, (legally available!) books, and videos of lectures. You=E2=80=99ll =
find it at=20

https://www.logicmatters.net/categories/

I initially wrote this really for my own use, to keep track of things I =
found. But the page has got over 25K visits in the last year, so =
obviously some others are finding it useful too.=20

I=E2=80=99ve had another non-categorial project recently, so haven=E2=80=99=
t been giving this page much attention. However, I=E2=80=99ve just now =
updated it, removed a couple of dead links and corrected some others. =
But please do let me know of appropriate recent materials I should be =
adding to the list =E2=80=94 and spread the word to students who might =
find it useful.
