I agree with this. But it should be clear that many times it is not 
conscious, but certainly it often smells of imposture. Other times it 
smells of excessive logic and formalism.

Concerning "injective" I see no problem at all that some times injective
means (1-1) and other times it means the dual of projective.

Where is the problem !!, the context always tells you which meaning it is
being used.
