TYPES 2019 post-proceedings submission deadline:  11 November 2019


                            Open call for papers

                            Post-proceedings of the
       25th International Conference on Types for Proofs and Programs
                                TYPES 2019


TYPES is a major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects
of type theory and its applications. TYPES 2019 was held 11-14 June in
Oslo,
Norway. The post-proceedings volume will be published in LIPIcs, Leibniz
International  Proceedings in Informatics, an open-access series of
conference
proceedings (http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics).

Submission to this post-proceedings volume is open to everyone, also to
those
who did not participate in the conference. We welcome high-quality
descriptions
of original work, as well as position papers, overview papers, and
system
descriptions. Submissions should be written in English, not overlapping
with
published or simultaneously submitted work to a journal or a conference
with
archival proceedings.

The scope of the post-proceedings is the same as the scope of the
conference:
the theory and practice of type theory.
In particular, we welcome submissions on the following topics:

* Foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics;
* Homotopy type theory and univalent mathematics;
* Applications of type theory;
* Dependently typed programming;
* Industrial uses of type theory technology;
* Meta-theoretic studies of type systems;
* Proof assistants and proof technology;
* Automation in computer-assisted reasoning;
* Links between type theory and functional programming;
* Formalizing mathematics using type theory.


IMPORTANT DATES

* Abstract submission:            4 November 2019
* Paper submission:               11 November 2019
* Author notification:            25 March 2020


DETAILS

* Papers have to be formatted with LIPIcs style (currently
lipics-v2019.cls)
    and adhere to the style requirements of LIPIcs:

http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/

* The upper limit for the length of submissions is 20 pages

* Papers have to be submitted in pdf through EasyChair:
      https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=types2019postproc

* Authors have the option to attach to their submission a zip or tgz
file
    containing code (formalized proofs or programs), but reviewers are not
    obliged to take the attachments into account and they will not be
published.

* In case of questions, e.g. on the page limit, contact one of the
editors.
