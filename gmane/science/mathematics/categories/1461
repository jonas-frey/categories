Good point, I did not see that! So the whole thing boils down to a very simple
observation on pointed endofunctors (which is certainly well-known for
reflectors): suppose you have an endofunctor F and a natural transformation
u:Id --> F which is pointwise monic; then, if Fu is pointwise epic, u itself is
pointwise epic. Proof:

        u_A     x,y
     A ---> FA ---> B
     |       |      |
 u_A |  u_FA |      | u_B
     |       |      |
     FA --> FFA --> FB
        Fu_A   Fx,Fy

( xu = yu gives Fx.Fu = Fy.Fu, hence Fx = Fy and then ux = uy and x = y.)


Coming back to injectivity: if u was pointwise an H-injective hull, then both
uF and Fu must be isos (independently of H being a class of monos or not!).
Hence, if H is a class of monos, the statement above applies.
