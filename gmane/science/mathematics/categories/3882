I'm not sure I agree with that: internal groupoids, at the very least,
show up in a variety of situations which non-category theorists can be,
and are, interested in.  Perhaps one of the reasons why some people try
to deal with groupoids as if they weren't a special case of categories
is because they never thought of categories in any other way than as a=20
mass of hom-sets.

Now I do think there is a good reason for this, which is the fact=20
that in functorial semantics (by which I don't just mean the original,=20
universal-algebraic, case), the domain category is typically small.
Raising to a small power does not destroy local smallness.

I agree with this entirely, of course.  It follows that, in a first=20
course on category theory, one should present both styles of definition=20
as soon as possible.  This, in turn, suggests (but does not prove) that=20
one should not sweep size distinctions under the carpet. =20

I look forward to it!
