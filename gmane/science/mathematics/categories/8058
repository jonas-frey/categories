Dear colleagues,

The Midlands Graduate School (MGS) in the Foundations of Computing =20
Science is a collaboration between researchers at the Universities of =20=

Birmingham, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield. It was established in =20=

1999. The MGS has two main goals: to provide PhD students with a sound =20=

basis for research in the mathematical and practical foundations of =20
computing and to give PhD students the opportunity to make contact =20
with established researchers in the field and their peers who are at a =20=

similar stage in their research careers.

This year, the MGS is at the University of Nottingham. It will start =20
on 22 April and finish on 26 April.

CORE COURSES

* Category Theory   (Roy Crole, Leicester)

* Denotational Semantics  (Achim Jung, Birmingham)

* Typed Lambda Calculus  (Paul Blain Levy, Birmingham)

ADVANCED COURSES

* Concurrency, Causality, Reversibility  (Irek Ulidowski, Leicester)

* Theory of Randomised Search Heuristics     (Dirk Sudholt, Per =20
Kristian Lehre,Pietro S. Oliveto, Christine Zarges, Birmingham, =20
Nottingham, Sheffield)

* Homotopy Type Theory     (Thorsten Altenkirch, Nottingham)

* Infinite Data Structures (Venanzio Capretta, Nottingham)

* Logical relations and parametricity  (Uday Reddy, Birmingham)

* Higher-Order Functional Reactive Programming (Neelakantan =20
Krishnaswami, Birmingham)

+ an invited lecture course on Dependently Typed Programming by Conor =20=

McBride (Strathclyde).

The fee is =A3440, this includes on campus accommodation with breakfast,
lunches, coffees and a workshop dinner!
