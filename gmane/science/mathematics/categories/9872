We are recruiting for a PhD position on

EFFICIENT AND NATURAL PROOFS AND ALGORITHMS

Deadline: 18 April 2019

Mathematical Foundations Group

<https://www.bath.ac.uk/projects/mathematical-foundations-of-computation/>=

Department of Computer Science
University of Bath


*** Description

Proofs and algorithms are everyday objects in our discipline, but they =
are still very mysterious. Suffice to say that we are currently unable =
to decide whether two given proofs or two given algorithms are the same; =
this is an old problem that dates back to Hilbert. Also, proofs and =
algorithms are intimately connected in the most famous open problem in =
mathematics: P vs NP.=20

We make progress by trying to unveil the fundamental structure behind =
proofs and algorithms, what we call their semantics. In other words, we =
are interested in the following questions:=20

What is a proof?=20
What is an algorithm?=20
How can we define them so that they have efficient and natural =
semantics?=20

The questions above are interesting in their own right, but we note that =
answering them will enable technological advances of great impact on =
society and the economy. For example, it will be possible to build a =
worldwide, universal tool for developing, validating, communicating and =
teaching mathematics. Also, quickly producing provably bug-free and =
secure software will become possible, so solving one of the most complex =
and important open engineering problems.=20

In order to understand proofs and algorithms, we create new mathematics =
starting from proof theory and semantics. The methods we use are mostly =
discrete, algebraic and combinatorial, but there is a growing =
geometrical component. The recent advances which our methods are mostly =
based on are linear logic, game semantics and deep inference.=20

Our group is very well financed via several grants. Thanks to our =
international relations, working with us means having a truly =
multicultural experience together with all the researchers at the =
forefront of this worldwide research effort. As a result, all our =
graduates work and publish at the highest level. The facilities at the =
University of Bath are outstanding and the city is so beautiful that =
UNESCO recognises it as a World Heritage Site.=20


*** Contact

For questions about the project or the application process, please =
contact us:

Alessio Guglielmi   A.Guglielmi@bath.ac.uk
Willem Heijltjes    W.B.Heijltjes@bath.ac.uk


*** How to apply

Applicants should hold, or expect to gain, a First Class or good Upper =
Second Class Honours degree, or the equivalent from an overseas =
university. A master=E2=80=99s level qualification would also be =
advantageous.=20

Formal applications should be made via the University of Bath=E2=80=99s =
online application form for a PhD in Computer Science:

_ipp_app&code1=3DRDUCM-FP01&code2=3D0013>

Anticipated start date: 30 September 2019.


*** Funding

Research Council funding is available on a competition basis to Home and =
EU students who have been resident in the UK for 3 years prior to the =
start of the project. For more information on eligibility, see:

<https://epsrc.ukri.org/skills/students/help/eligibility/>

Funding will cover Home/EU tuition fees, a stipend (=C2=A314,777 per =
annum for 2018/19) and a training support fee of =C2=A31,000 per annum =
for 3.5 years.=20

Applicants classed as Overseas for tuition fee purposes are NOT eligible =
for funding; however, we welcome all-year-round applications from =
self-funded candidates and candidates who can source their own funding.=
