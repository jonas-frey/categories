-- was only to be expected, but it caught me by surprise, anyway,
for at his U of M "90th" birthday party last fall he seemed still
very much alive and perky. As that was to be the last time I'd
see him again, I'm very glad I took part there. And I'm so shaken
by this loss, I can't find words. Jim, we'll all miss you.
