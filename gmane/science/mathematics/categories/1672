I believe the original post asked what coalgebras might be good for.
Dusko Pavlovic already talked about examples of coinduction in
analysis. Let me mention two examples from constructive mathematics.
They are both examples of final coalgebras for polynomial functors.

A polynomial functor P_f with signature f: B --> A is a functor of the
form

   P_f(X) = \sum_{a \in A} X^{f^{*} a}

where \sum is a dependent sum, and f^{*} is the inverse image of f.
For the purposes of this post you can think of a polynomial functor as 
one of the form

   P(X) = C_0 + C_1 x X^{N_1} + ... + C_k x X^{N_k}

where C_0, ..., C_k and N_0, ..., N_k are (constant) objects.

Suppose we are in a constructive setting (a variant of Martin-Lof type
theory, effective topos, a PER model, ...) in which every polynomial
functor has a final coalgebra.



Example 1:

In constructive mathematics _spreads_ and _fans_ play an important
role. They are examples of final coalgebras. For example, a fan is a
finitely branching tree (can be infinite!) in which the nodes are
labeled with natural numbers. The space of all fans FAN satisfies the
identity

  FAN = N + N x FAN + N x FAN^2 + N x FAN^3 + ...
      = sum_{k \in N} N x FAN^k

it is the final coalgebra for the polynomial functor

  P(X) = \sum_{k \in N} N x FAN^k

I find this presentation conceptually cleaner than the usual encoding
of spreads as sets of Goedel codes of finite sequences of natural
numbers (of course, this presentation requires a richer type theory).
Also, this definition is easily adapted to fans and spreads labeled by
elements of any set A (just replace N x FAN^k with A x FAN^k), and of
any branching type.

By the way, FAN is isomorphic to N^N, and N^N is the final coalgebra
for the functor P(X) = N x X.


Example 2:

The initial algebra for P(X) = 1 + X is the set of natural numbers.

The final coalgebra N^+ for this functor is best thought of as the
one-point compactification of the natural numbers, as it consists of
the natural numbers together with one extra point "at infinity". In
classical set theory, this is no different from natural numbers, but
in a constructive setting the point at infinity is not isolated. If
one wants to prove anything interesting about N^+, just about the only
way to do it is to use coinduction and corecursion. It's a good
exercise.

This is neat because we get a one-point compactification of N without
any reference to topology.

If we compute N^+ in PER(D), where D is some topological model of the
untyped lambda calculus, such as P(omega) or the universal Scott
domain, we get _precisely_ the one-point compactification of natural
numbers.

In the effective topos N^+ can be described as an equivalence relation
on partial recursive functions, where two such functions are
equivalent if, and only if, they terminate in the same number of steps
(when applied to some fixed input) or they diverge. The divergent
functions represent the point at infinity, and those terminating in
exactly k steps represent the number k.
