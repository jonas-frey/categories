Well, I intent to work as Joyal-Tierney do in their memoir, justified by
the internal logic of the topos (e.g. Joyal-Boileau). In this way,
internal sites have objects, internal lattices have elements, presheaves
H can be evaluated in an object C of the site CC yielding an object HC
in SS, etc etc. Sheaves are presheaves satisfying the usual
requirements, they form a Grothendieck (or bounded) topos
sh(CC) = EE ---> SS over SS, etc etc. In this context I asked:

The answers of David Roberts and Andreas Blass on MathOverflow (that I
quoted in a previous posting) say the arguing (in the internal language)
was correct, and this seems quite satisfactory to me. But there was no
explicit or detailed justification.

Thomas Streicher (and Marta Bunge making Thomas answer her own) answer
bringing into play the theory of fibrations/indexed. I appreciate this
answer because made me think different aspects of the question, and for
the references given.

But fibrations/indexed are not necessary when working as in
Joyal-Tierney Memoir (as they are not used in that memoir, which by the
way, is extremely carefully written)

In this last posting, I realized they are answering a different
question, it seems quite extraordinary! that we were taking of different
things without realizing it !! (I reading their answers, and they
reading my question and my expanded clarification)

I say F: CC ---> SS the inverse image of a point. Abusing notation as
usual, we also write F: EE ---> SS.

Now, as it follows from this last posting, they (for some reason that I
ignore) interpret that F is the inverse image SS ---> EE of the g.m.
EE ---> SS defining EE over SS (g.m. that I did not even denoted by any
letter since it does not play a role in the formulation of the
question). The g.m whose inverse image I denoted F is that of a point SS
---> EE, as I explicitely say it, and as I thought it was clear in my
question.

I should have realized in the original Thomas answer that he was
thinking in a different question, but did not !.

All this is mathematics, so I hope it should be completely clarified.

The question and its derivations may be of interest to members of the
list that do not post about it, but if the moderator thinks this is not
so, I will pursue my search for understanding these matters privately.

best   e.d.
