Related to Marco's point:

In order to define the category Set, we have to define Set(X,Y) for
all sets X and Y.  There are many isomorphic options, but to get a
category we have  to choose one.

Now replace "category" by "category with distinguished binary products
and exponentials.".  We shall then have to choose a particular
implementation of X x Y and X -> Y.  Why do some people find this
philosophically objectionable?  How is it worse than choosing
Set(X,Y)?  (Personally, I'd be inclined to make the same choice for X -
  > Y as for Hom(X,Y).)
