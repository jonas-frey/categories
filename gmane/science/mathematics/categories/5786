Colin's comment didn't seem cryptic to me - let me guess what he meant.

I thought he meant:

3) If you don't take the prevailing meaning of words seriously, you're
likely to talk in ways that people won't understand, unless they happen to
already know everything you're trying to say.

I worry about this point a lot, because I often want to "fix" standard
mathematical terminology that I dislike, and I have to weigh my desire to do
that against my desire to be understood by people who are unwilling to learn
new ways of talking.

For example: do I use "n-category" to mean "weak n-category", which will
eventually be the most sensible course of action, but may be premature, or
do I use it to mean "strict n-category", as tradition dictates?

Best,
