Dear Professor Boerger,

there are counterexamples to this in elementary topoi. In the effective
topos there are nontrivial objects X such that 2^X is isomorphic to 2
(for example, one can take the object R of real numbers for X; this
gives a mono 2^R>->R), and the inclusion N-->N^{P(N)} is an isomorphism
(giving a mono N^{P(N)}>->P(N) , where P(N) is the power object of N).
I believe the example of 2^R>->R also holds in sheaf toposes where
(internally) the object of functions R^R coincides with the object of
continuous functions (since R is always connected).

Best, Jaap van Oosten
