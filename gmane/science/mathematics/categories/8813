Hi, for a couple of years now, we have been using categories to relate =
grammatical structure (eg Lambek calculus/pregroups) to meaning spaces =
used in natural language processing eg vector spaces.  The interface of =
interaction is properly categorical.  The best analogy would be that =
while a TQFT functorially maps topology change on linear maps, here =
grammatical reduction is mapped on composition of meanings, yielding an =
algorithm that computes meanings of phrases and sentences from meaning =
of parts.  This method has outperformed other ones in NLP.  Here are =
