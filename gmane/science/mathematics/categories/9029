Dear Bill,

I'd really like to understand these issues about gros and petit toposes bett=
er.

My own current direction with arithmetic universes is - I believe - a reason=
able one to try in respect to geometric theories and classifying toposes, bu=
t it loses sight of gros toposes and synthetic approaches, which, after all,=
  were part of the founding ideas of toposes. I need to know better what it i=
s that I risk losing.

However, my attempts to understand gros toposes run into difficulties with g=
eometricity. This is illustrated by the Zariski topos for algebras over a fi=
eld k. If k is R or C then the geometric methodology expects it and its alge=
bras to be locales (and non-discrete), not sets. But does the polynomial rin=
g R[x] exist localically? The degree of a polynomial looks like being part o=
f the geometric structure, and removing leading zeros (e.g. after a subtract=
ion) is not continuous.

Do you know if anyone has investigated a localic form of these methods in al=
gebraic geometry?

All the best,

Steve.

p.s. I like to think I'm following Grothendieck's insights, but the truth is=
  I understand only a tiny fraction of them.
