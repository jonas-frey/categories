The Computational Logic and Applications (CLA) workshops are a series of
annual meetings (cf. https://cla.tcs.uj.edu.pl), whose main purpose is to
provide a free and open forum for research on combinatorial and
quantitative aspects of mathematical logic and their applications in
computer science. The next meeting will take place in Versailles (France)
in July 1-2, 2019. It will be followed by a special issue of DMTCS
dedicated to the same topics.


SCOPE
Topics within the scope of CLA include:
=E2=80=94 combinatorics of lambda calculus and related formalisms,
=E2=80=94 quantitative aspects of program evaluation and normalisation,
=E2=80=94 asymptotic enumeration in computational logic,
=E2=80=94 statistical properties of formulae, terms and programs,
=E2=80=94 random generation of large combinatorial structures in computatio=
nal
logic,
=E2=80=94 randomness in software testing and counter-example generation met=
hods.


WORKSHOP
Submission of a talk proposal for the meeting should be done no later than
June 11, 2019, by sending a short abstract through Easychair (
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcla2019).
The steering committee will decide on the meeting=E2=80=99s program by June=
  14,
2019.
Attendance is free upon registration.

Invited speakers:
=E2=80=94 Samuele Giraudo (LIGM, Univ. Marne la Vall=C3=A9e, France)
=E2=80=94 Clemens Grabmayer (TCS, Vrije Univ. Amsterdam, Netherland)

The steering committee for the workshop is
=E2=80=94 Antoine Genitrini (Sorbonne University, Paris, France)
=E2=80=94 Alain Giorgetti (University of Bourgogne Franche-Comt=C3=A9, Besa=
n=C3=A7on, France)
=E2=80=94 Bernhard Gittenberger (TU Wien, Vienna, Austria)
=E2=80=94 Katarzyna Grygiel (Jagiellonian University, Krak=C3=B3w, Poland)
=E2=80=94 Micha=C5=82 Pa=C5=82ka (Chalmers University of Technology, Gothen=
burg, Sweden)
=E2=80=94 Noam Zeilberger (University of Birmingham, United Kingdom)

The organising committee is composed of
=E2=80=94 Olivier Bodini (University Paris 13, Villetaneuse, France)
=E2=80=94 Dani=C3=A8le Gardy (University of Versailles, Versailles, France)
=E2=80=94 Antoine Genitrini (Sorbonne University, Paris, France)


SPECIAL ISSUE
Following the meeting, a special issue of DMTCS is planned for early 2020
with full papers on the topics of CLA. These papers can be either results
presented at the 2019 CLA meeting, or at a former meeting but not published
elsewhere, or results not presented at CLA, as long as they fall within the
scope of the workshop. The submitted papers should present original
research, including survey papers, which is not already published or
submitted to publication to another journal.

The editors for the special issue are
=E2=80=94 Olivier Bodini (University Paris 13, Villetaneuse, France)
=E2=80=94 Bernhard Gittenberger (TU Wien, Vienna, Austria)
=E2=80=94 Marek Zaionc (Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland)
The papers will be refereed according to the usual standards of DMTCS.


IMPORTANT DATES
