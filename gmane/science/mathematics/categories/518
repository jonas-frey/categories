Under one view, there is a mismatch in the comparison between toposes and
Abelian categories. Consider enriched category theory over Set and Ab[elian
groups].

Over Set: enriched category A = small category, A-action = functor from A
to Set (covariant or contra- for right or left action), cat of A-actions =
Set^A or Set^A^op, wlog a presheaf topos, "quotient" (by Grothendieck
topology) = general Grothendieck topos.

Over Ab: enriched category A = ringoid ("ring with several objects"),
A-action = right or left module over A, cat of A-actions = Mod-A or A-Mod,
"quotient" (by Gabriel topology, a.k.a. hereditary torsion theory) =
Grothendieck category, i.e. cocomplete Abelian category in which direct
limits are exact and there is a generator.

By the Lubkin-Heron-Freyd-Mitchell theorems, Abelian categories embed fully
faithfully in Grothendieck categories but are more general. Assuming this
parallel Grothendieck toposes || Grothendieck categories is a good one, is
there a natural parallel of Abelian categories on the Set-enriched side?
