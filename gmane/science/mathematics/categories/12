Dear Jonathan:

There will be an upcoming workshop June 19-20 at the CRM (Centre de =20
Recherches Mathematiques) at the University
of Montreal, dedicated to Michael Makkai's 70th birthday, which is =20
exactly on this theme.  Its  local organizers
are Robert Seely and me, along with two model theorists (Bradd Hart =20
and Tommy Kucera), who were students of Makkai.

This was announced on this list some time ago, but a more up-to-date =20
announcement with the official CRM webpage will shortly be made
available from CRM.  I will post information soon.

										=
Cheers,

Phil Scott
