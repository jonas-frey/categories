[Note from moderator: The NUMDAM project has extraordinary interest for
category theorists, not least because Mme Ehresmann has told me that
Cahiers will be aomng the journals covered there before long. Some of the
seminars already available are more than classic. Other URL's mentioned
below lead to more treasures. Enjoy.]

Subject: [esc-plus] Digitization - European Progress and more

It appears that we have some stiff competition.  The NUMDAM project has
an impressive list of journals digitized:
http://archive.numdam.org/numdam-bin/browse
with some nice metadata available
http://www.numdam.org/en/infotech.php

Another snapshot is provided by
http://www.library.cornell.edu/math/digitalization.php
at Cornell.

As far as OCR of mathematics is concerned, my efforts with Google have
not yielded anything "new".  For reference these were interesting:
http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=3304
http://units.sla.org/division/dpam/pam-bulletin/vol31/no1/mathematics.html
http://www.inftyproject.org/en/
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&id=190438
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=628842 (and its references)
Even this large list
http://tev.itc.it/OCR/ResearchProjects.html
of research projects only mentions 1 that has to do with mathematics.

However, I have searched for sources of freely available TIFFs for
experimental purposes - and did not really find any.  While it might be
possible to get some from Cornell (see
http://historical.library.cornell.edu/math/help.html), this is not obvious.
