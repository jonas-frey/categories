FIRST SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO I)
                CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham
                20-21 September, 2018

      http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vicaryjo/syco/1/

The Symposium on Compositional Structures is a new interdisciplinary
series of meetings aiming to support the growing community of
researchers interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from
both applied and abstract perspectives, and in particular where
category theory serves as a unifying common language. We welcome
submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics,
physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly
discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge between
fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature research and work in
progress, and by both established academics and junior researchers,
including students.

This new series aims to bring together the communities behind many
previous successful events which have taken place over the last
decade, including "Categories, Logic and Physics", "Categories, Logic
and Physics (Scotland)", "Higher-Dimensional Rewriting and
Applications", "String Diagrams in Computation, Logic and Physics",
"Applied Category Theory", "Simons Workshop on Compositionality", and
the "Peripatetic Seminar in Sheaves and Logic".

# INVITED SPEAKERS

David Corfield, Department of Philosophy, University of Kent: "The
ubiquity of modal type theory"
Jules Hedges, Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford:
"Compositional game theory"
