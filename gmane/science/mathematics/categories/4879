Larry Lambe passed on the following url to me for comment and I thought =
it would be of interest to others on the category theory list, with more =
expertise than I. I have not had time to study it, but on the face of =
it,  it seems like patenting mathematics, and to be deplored intensely.  =
Am I wrong?=20

Title:
Method and apparatus for determining colimits of hereditary diagrams=20
Document Type and Number:
United States Patent 6964037=20

A computer-implemented method and system for determining colimits of =
hereditary diagrams. A user specifies a diagram of diagram and specifies =
performance of a colimit operation. Once the colimit is performed, the =
name of the colimit is added to the hereditary diagram. The described =
embodiment supports diagrams of diagrams, also called hierarchical =
diagrams.
