You could not convince me because I agree, and, moreover, I knew that even
before we first met (in Predela, Bulgaria). More precisely, I know, from
your remarks, but also independently, many mathematical examples where using
fibrations is infinitely better than using indexed categories. I only insist
on replacing "always very bad" with "sometimes very bad". To explain why I
say "before we first met", let me mention 'my' example: extending
Inassaridze's work on generalized satellites in early 70s, my first step was
exactly to replace indexed categories with fibrations! By the way, talking
about fibrations, why do we never mention Yoneda's regular spans, as defined
in

[N. Yoneda, On Ext and exact sequences, J. Fac. Sci. Tokyo 18, 1960,
507-576]?

Forgive me, I said "semi-left-exact" (in the sense of
Cassidy--Hebert--Kelly, or, equivalently, one of versions of "admissible" in
the sense of Galois theory), not "left exact". The mathematical argument
consists of the following observations:

(a) A functor F : X-->Y is a fibration if and only if, for every object x in
X, the induced functor F^x : X/x-->Y/F(x) has a right inverse right adjoint.

(b) This is also true if we replace "fibration" with "pseudo-fibration" and
"right inverse right adjoint" with "fully faithful right adjoint" (that is,
if we "do everything up to an isomorphism").

(c) As follows from (b), whenever X and Y have finite limits, F : X-->Y is a
pseudo-fibration if and only if the induced functor F^1 : X/1-->Y/F(1)
(where 1 a terminal object in X, and so X/1 is isomorphic to X) is a
semi-left-exact reflection.

(d) In particular, if F preserves terminal object (and X and Y have finite
limits), then F is a pseudo-fibration if and only if it is a semi-left-exact
reflection.

I understand that you can tell me that there are a lot of cases where my
'mild' conditions do not hold (e.g. it is the case for 'almost' all discrete
fibrations), but, on the other hand there are so many examples where they
do - including those sent to you in my joint message with Ross Street and
Steve Lack. (Actually it was Steve who once asked me, why don't I mention
fibrations?)

In order to avoid any confusion, let me immediately point out that I never
suggested to anyone to replace fibrations with semi-left-exact reflections
in general.

And since you asked about "deeply related": is not it deep that in many case
thinking of abstract cartesian liftings can be replaced with thinking of
adjoint functors and pullbacks? Note that the pullbacks enter the story when
we calculate the right adjoint of F^x using the right adjoint of F. In fact
if we think that F has an "easy" right adjoint, then we can think of
cartesian liftigs as 'reduced to pullbacks' - which is an additional nice
reason for using the term "cartesian".

With great respect to you and your ideas and results-
George
