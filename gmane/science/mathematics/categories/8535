It is difficult to understand "without objects"  without any definition of "=
object". Remember that =2C already before the 21st century=2C modern mathema=
tics had begun to overcome medieval metaphysics. In fact =2Cin the late 195=
0s=2C Alexander Grothendieck had made explicit the definition of "subobject=
"=2C which seems relevant here=2C as does his powerful legacy of relativiza=
tion in several senses. Now we understand that a category C in a category U=
  is a truncated simplicial object C0->...->C3 satisfying certain limit cond=
itions. We are free to call C0 'objects" and C1 "maps" and since C0->C1 is =
a subobject of C1=2C we could also say that objects "are" maps=2Cbut "mimic=
ked by" seems =10unnecessary (as well as undefined).
(Recall that it is actions of such a C in a topos U that form the topos enve=
loping=2C as a full subtopos of sheaves=2C the typical U-topos E->U).
To give a category "with objects" i=10n a serious sense would seem to be gi=
ving MORE than ju=10st a category=2C for example an interpretation as struc=
turesC-> B^A=2C the (functor category also emphasized by Grothendieck)of st=
ructures of shape A in background B. (Where perhaps B is equipped with an i=
nternal embedding in U itself)
The case of no structure and featureless background ( which seems to be the=
   default setting of modern mathematics despite the preference of MacLane's=
dear teacher for a vonNeuman-like setting) means in particular that the C0 =
in a category there consists of "lauter Einsen" in the sense of Cantor.
Those featureless elements X of C0 do obtain a structure by virtue of C1=2C=
C2 because taking the latter into account we can see the inside of  X as th=
e "comma" category C/X involving (not only the subobjects of X and their inc=
lusions=2C but also singular figures and reparameterizations) as very exten=
sively utilized by Grothendieck .
