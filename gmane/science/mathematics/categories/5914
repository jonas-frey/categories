Dear all,

Andr=E9 makes a proper and convincing case for the importance of pointed=20
spaces in algebraic topology . Part of this importance is the difficulty=20
of homotopy theory, which necessitates approximations, and these are=20
sometimes adequate and convenient.  Henry Whitehead introduced two=20
methods to approximate homotopy theory: one was to describe special=20
cases such as the category of polyhedra which were n-dimensional and=20
r-connected, e.g. n small, or r near to n. The other was stabilisation.=20
However, in introducing CW-complexes in ``Combinatorial Homotopy I'' he=20
explains that he does not stick to the single vertex case since he wants=20
to include covering spaces. There is often no canonical choice of base=20
point in a covering space; there are also advantages in an account which=20
does not require connectivity. .

I was told that one of Philip Hall's dictums was that you want the=20
algebra to model the geometry, and not try to force it into a previously=20
known format.

Grothendieck wrote in part:

Choosing paths for connecting the base points
natural to the situation to one among them, and reducing the
groupoid to a single  group, will then hopelessly destroy the
structure and inner symmetries of the situation, and result in a
mess of generators and relations no one dares to write down, because
everyone feels they won't be of any use whatever, and just confuse
the picture rather than clarify it. I have known such perplexity
myself a long time ago, namely in Van Kampen type situations, whose
only understandable formulation is in terms of (amalgamated sums of)
groupoids.

Cases where the choice of a single base point is inconvenient are when=20
there is a group action (as shown by Higgins and Taylor, 1981); in=20
non-connected cases; in Nielsen fixed point theory (as shown by Philip=20
Heath, and recently by Kate Proto); and for work in algebraic geometry=20
by Zoonekynd.

I like the description of the circle as obtained from the unit interval=20
[0,1] by identifying 0 and 1 in the category of spaces; and of the=20
integers as obtained from the `unit interval groupoid '  cal I  (the=20
indiscrete groupoid on {0,1}, and so finite) by identifying 0 and 1 in=20
the category of groupoids.

One gets analogous results for \pi_n as modules over \pi_1 in describing=20
\pi_n(S^n \vee S^1). Of course this example can be done using covering=20
spaces, but that seems a roundabout route.

The Bass-Serre theory of graphs of groups often uses choice of base=20
points and of trees; yet Higgins showed in 1976 that there was a nice=20
normal form for the fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups.

The action of Z_2 on S^1 by reflection has 2 fixed points, and is better=20
described  (look at quotients)  by the action of Z_2 on the fundamental=20
groupoid with these as base points rather than on the fundamental group=20
on one of them (which one?).

The success in 1967-8 (as it seemed to me) of groupoids in 1-dimensional=20
homotopy theory led me ask for possible uses of groupoids in higher=20
homotopy theory, and this  has led with fortunate collaborations  to the=20
notions of `higher dimensional group theory' and `higher dimensional=20
algebra', and various new algebraic structures with applications;  an=20
account of some aspects of these is in press with the EMS, and might be=20
thought of as `towards nonabelian algebraic topology'.

I confess not to have found the appropriate many base point version with=20
applications of the fundamental cat^n-group of an n-cube of spaces for=20
n> 1.

So it is a case of horses for courses.

Ronnie
