Category theorists in general, and topos theorists in particular,
may want to check out this week's cover story in the New Scientist
(www.newscientist.com). The author (Robert Matthews of Aston
University in Birmingham) is clearly a fan of Chris Isham: it's not
clear to me whether he actually knows what a topos is, but he has
committed himself to statements such as

"Topos theory could lead to a view of reality more astonishing
and successful than quantum theory"

which is splashed all over page 32 of the magazine. Even if you don't
believe this (and I don't think I do) it's pleasant to see topos theory
getting this sort of publicity.
