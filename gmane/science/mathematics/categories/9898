Deadline Extension: Contributions may be submitted at: =
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsemspace2019 =
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsemspace2019> by **17th May =
2019**

AIMS AND SCOPE
Vector embeddings of word meanings have become a mainstream tool in =
large scale natural language processing tools. The use of vectors to =
represent meanings in semantic spaces or feature spaces is also employed =
in cognitive science. Unrelated to natural language and cognitive =
science, vectors and vector spaces have been extensively used as models =
of physical theories and especially the theory of quantum mechanics. =
Crucial similarities between the vector representations of quantum =
mechanics and those of natural language are exhibited via bicompact =
linear logic and compact closed categorical structures in natural =
language.

Exploiting the common ground provided by vector spaces, the workshop =
will bring together researchers working at the intersection of NLP, =
cognitive science, and physics, offering to them an appropriate forum =
for presenting their uniquely motivated work and ideas. The interplay =
between these three disciplines will foster theoretically motivated =
approaches to understanding how meanings of words interact with each =
other in sentences and discourse via grammatical types, how they are =
determined by input from the world, and how word and sentence meanings =
interact logically.

Topics of interests include (but are not restricted to):
Reasoning in semantic spaces
Compositionality in semantic spaces and conceptual spaces
Conceptual spaces in linguistics and natural language processing
Applications of quantum logic in natural language processing and =
cognitive science
Modelling functional words such as prepositions and relative pronouns in =
compositional distributional models of meaning
Diagrammatic reasoning for natural language processing and cognitive =
science
Modelling so-called =E2=80=98non-compositional=E2=80=99 phenomena such =
as metaphor

IMPORTANT DATES:
**17th May 2019**: Paper submission
7th June 2019: Notification to contributors
5th-9th August: Workshop dates

CONFIRMED SPEAKERS:
Professor Ruth Kempson FBA, Emeritus Professor of Linguistics, King's =
College, London, UK
Dr Jamie Kiros, Research Scientist, Google Brain
Dr Sanjaye Ramgoolam, Reader in Theoretical Physics, Queen Mary =
University of London, UK

SUBMISSIONS:
We invite:
Original contributions (up to 12 pages) of previously unpublished work. =
Submission of substantial, albeit partial, results of work in progress =
is welcomed.

Extended abstracts (3 pages) of previously published work that is recent =
and relevant to the workshop. These should include a link to a =
separately published paper or preprint.

Original contributions will be published in a special issue of the =
Journal of Applied Logics - IfCoLog Journal of Logics and their =
Applications (http://collegepublications.co.uk/ifcolog/about/ =
<http://collegepublications.co.uk/ifcolog/about/>).
