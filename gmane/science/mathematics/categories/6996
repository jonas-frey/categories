no offense, steve, but we are for some reason telling each other things =
that we both surely know that we both know them.

internally, of course, every A thinks that there is an a in A. that is =
what its free variable of type A tells it. when A=3D0, then the =
predicate P(a), for free a,  as well as the inverse images of (all) =
x.P(x) and  of (exists) x.P(x) along the map 0-->1, all boil down to the =
same predicate 0-->Prop. so they turn out to be quite equivalent. =20

because i thought that some people would remember that it is just the =
good old Beck-Benabou-Chevalley-Roubaud condition (to list the =
discoverers alphabetically); whereas the others would be satisfied that =
quantifying over a variable b, that does not occur in a predicate, does =
not change the truth value of that predicate.

but i do see what you are saying when we take P:0-->Prop to be a =
0-indexed family of propositions, and interpret the quantifiers as the =
meet and the join: the empty meet is indeed greater than the empty join. =
so the logicians are eliminating the empty domain in order to avoid =
having to specify the inverse images. (i think i used to know that.)=20

isn't it unreasonable to sacrifice a part of the structure (a fairly =
ubiquitous object) to a mere syntactic habit? i thought categorical =
logic had provided a good solution to the "nonempty domain" nuisance =
from the 50s logic books.

all the best (and i really have to work now),
