An alternative way how libraries could support electronic publications
arises from the following thoughts.

What will or should be the role of libraries in the digital age?

Certainly, buying and storing hardcopies will play a smaller and smaller
role. So libraries should have an interest in finding something else to
do, just to survive as institutions themselves. What could that be?

I think university libraries could become publishers of electronic
journals. Universities should have an interest to host these journals,
because they provide prestige for little money.

As a conclusion, maybe the libraries could be convinced to DO the
`clerical support'.
