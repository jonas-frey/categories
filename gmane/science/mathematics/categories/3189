I asked Peter May where he had commented on the relevance of
Jon's work to his own:

No time to write, though.  The paper was ``On H-spaces and infinite
loop spaces''.   The work of his I most liked concerned distributivity
laws and monads, which I only learned about after rediscovering it for
myself while doing multiplicative infinite loop space theory.

See you next week,

Peter
