Thomas Streicher asked about the "operational semantics" of the ASD
calculus, and in particular computation with Dedekind cuts.  As he
says, the public documentation is rather limited at the moment, but
Andrej and I don't want to give all our ideas away before we have
made good use of them ourselves.

The first thing that one should say about "operational semantics"
is that mathematical formulae do NOT come with a prescibed way of
computing them.  A large part of what makes mathematics interesting
is that there may be many ways of looking at a problem, besides the
"obvious" one.  The two situations in which notation does come with a
preferred way of computing with it are long multiplication and lambda
calculus, but even these cases are open to INGENUITY in finding better
algorithms.

Yes. In fact, there are two notions of locatedness, and this is the
stronger one, which is necessary for arithemetic.   There are some
comments linking these ideas to the Archimedean axiom and the Conway
numbers in Sections 11 and 12 of "The Dedekind reals in ASD".

Yes, that's right, except that  "a mapping  c : Q -> 2_\bot" is not
a very helpful way of formulating it.   When computing a real number,
what we have (going back very clearly to Archimedes) is a pair of
logical formulae, each with a single free variable (p and q in your
notation, d and u in ours).  One of which says when p is less than
the real number being computed, and the other when q is greater.
In order to fix the precision, we add another constraint that
squeezes them close together.

Then, as Thomas rightly says,

Yes, it does, exactly.  Notice that the "real number" is only on
the "outside" of the computation,  and is only manifested when we want
to print it out --- hence my earlier pun that it is "peripheral".

The "guts" of the computation are with LOGICAL formulae.

Yes, but interval arithmetic is only one of a variety of tools.

Also, if you only think of intervals as a way of computing real numbers
to a given precision, you miss their real power.  Plainly, these
intervals just get wider and wider.

Really, one should think of interval analysis as USING CRUDE ARITHMETIC
TO DERIVE STRONG LOGICAL INFORMATION ABOUT FUNCTIONS.

For example,  if, when a function f is applied to an interval [d,u]
using Moore arithmetics, the result   f[d,u]   lies within an interval
(e,t),  which we may determine purely ARITHMETICALLY, then we know
the LOGICAL statement that   All x:[d,u]. e < f(x) < t.

Since  f  is given, not just as a funtion in the set-theoretic sense
of a collection of input--output pairs,  but as a FORMULA in a certain
language,  we may differentiate it formally, and apply interval
arithmetic to that, obtaining even stronger LOGICAL information about
the behaviour of the function.

Examining the language, the real work consists of manipulating
inequalities between polynomials over certain ranges of the variables.
Often we just want to know whether the inequality ALWAYS, SOMETIMES
or NEVER holds.   A simple way to answer this question may just be
Moore-wise evaluation,

Then there is the sitation where the inequality is  f(x,y) > 0 in
a certain rectangle.  The polynomial defines a curve (=0) and two
regions (<0 and >0).  As we increase the precision, the curve
becomes closer to being a straight line, and the main numerical
computation is of the gradient of this line, and of a narrow
rectangle that encloses the curve.

Just as the well known Moore arithmetic provides a way of evaluating
universally quantified statments,  so Kaucher arithmetic with back-
to-front intervals answers existential statements.

I don't want to go into more detail that this, because we want to
get the credit for making this work (although we are keen to invove
more collaborators).   But also, these are just SOME of the things
that might be done,  AFTER ESCAPING FROM THE MENTAL STRAITJACKET of
computation with Cauchy sequences or intervals.
