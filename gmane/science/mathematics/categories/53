Floating-point reals have terrible theoretical properties;
they're not even a ring (not even classically).
This is why even after all of Kahan's good work on algorithms,
rounding errors are unavoidable (the "Table-Maker's Dilemma").

A floating-point real basically consists of a rational number x
together with a rational maximum error e, subject to the condition
that, for some integer n, 10^n x is an integer and e = 10^{-n}/2.
(There is some redundancy in this simplified description.)
This is not acceptable constructively, since one cannot prove
(even with countable choice, impredicative power sets, etc)
that every real number has such a floating-point representation.

At the very least, one must add some epsilon to the maximum e;
to keep it simple, I would set e to 10^{-n} (so that 1.6 is acceptable
as the result of 5/3, although good algorithms would probably give 1.7).
This would remove rounding errors from the Table-Maker's Dilemma.
I believe (but I may be wrong through unfamiliarity with the literature)
that most researchers prefer instead to allow arbitrarily large e,
thus using interval arithmetic, even though this is more complicated.

(Actual implementations of floating-point arithmetic
usually also have maximum allowed values of both n and 10^n x,
leading to rounding errors from underflow and overflow.
However, overflow errors already arise in natural-number arithmetic,
so this is not really the fault of the floating-point idea.
One can delay all such errors until run-time memory limits.)
