I believe that Aguiar and Mahajan were the first to formally introduce this
concept, though the Alexander-Whitney-Eilenberg-MacLane example has been
around for a long time.

On the n-Category Cafe, Kathryn Hess recently wrote:

I forget if "Frobenius monoidal" is a precise synonym of "bilax monoidal".
