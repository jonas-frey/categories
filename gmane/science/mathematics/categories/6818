Dear All

If any of you know any bright young things looking to do a PhD using =
category theory then can you let them know about this possibility.
I'm afraid the funding is only for EU passport holders.

All the best
Neil

                                    PhD Position
                                         in
      Category Theory and Functional Programming

      Department of Computer and Information Sciences
           University of Strathclyde, Scotland

Applications are invited for one PhD position within the Mathematically
Structured Programming group at the University of Strathclyde. The group
comprises Prof. Neil Ghani, Dr. Patricia Johann, Dr. Conor McBride, Dr.
Peter Hancock, Dr. Robert Atkey, and six PhD students. The PhD project
centres around applications of categorical methods to functional =
programming
languages. The project is under the direction of Patricia Johann.

The successful applicant will have either a first-class degree or an MSc =
in
Mathematics or Computing Science or a related subject with a strong
Mathematics or Computing Science component. Ideally, they will also have =
a
strong, documented interest in doing research. Strong mathematical
background and problem-solving skills are essential; good programming =
skills
are a plus. Prior knowledge of category theory and/or functional =
programming
is an advantage, but is not required.

The PhD position is for 3 years; it starts in January 2012. The
position is a fully-funded post for a UK or EU student, and includes =
both
coverage of fees and an EPSRC-level stipend for each of the three years.
More information about the department is available at

       http://www.strath.ac.uk/cis

The University of Strathclyde (http://www.strath.ac.uk) is located in =
the
heart of Glasgow, which Lonely Planet Travel Guides hail as "one of
Britain's largest, liveliest and most interesting cities" (see
http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/scotland/glasgow/). Southern =
Scotland
provides a particularly stimulating environment for researchers in
theoretical computer science, with active groups in this area at =
Heriot-Watt
University, the University of Edinburgh, the University of Glasgow, the
University of St. Andrews, and the University of Strathclyde.

Requests for further information and other informal enquiries can be =
sent
to:
       Patricia Johann
       patricia at cis.strath.ac.uk

Those interested in the position are asked to send e-mail to the address
given above in the next short while.=
