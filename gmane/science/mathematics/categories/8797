Workshop Announcement and call for participation: New directions in Inverse=
  semigroups.

University of Ottawa, June 1-4. Organizers: Philip Scott and Pieter Hofstra

Scientific Background: Inverse semigroups algebraically model partial symme=
try, generalizing the way groups model global symmetry. They were introduce=
d in the 1950's as a correct algebraic setting for studying pseudogroups (o=
f partial homeomorphisms between open subsets of a topological space).The i=
nfluential monograph of J. Renault (1980) highlighted the close connections=
  between inverse semigroups, \'etale groupoids, and C*-algebras. Later, Kel=
lendonk developed connections of inverse semigroups to aperiodic tilings an=
d C*-algebras, inspired in part by Shechtman's work on quasicrystals in the=
  1980's. Recently, in joint work of Kudryavtseva, Lawson, Lenz, and Resende=
, a global understanding of the relationship between inverse semigroups and=
  \'etale groupoids has been put in the categorical setting of non-commutati=
ve Stone duality.
Additionally, work by various researchers has also established important co=
nnections between inverse semigroups, toposes, and MV-algebras.

Purpose of the Workshop: the workshop will focus on various themes surround=
ing inverse semigroups and their applications, with the goal of bringing to=
gether researchers from each of the surrounding areas.

Workshop Format: the meeting will consist of roughly three days of invited =
and contributed talks, both from senior professors and young researchers. T=
he meeting will start with overview talks by experts in their area, aimed a=
t bringing newcomers to the field up to speed with recent developments.

Invited Talks: there will be invited talks by the following researchers: R.=
  Exel (U. Santa Catarina), J. Funk (CUNY), G. Kudryavtseva (U. Ljubljana), =
M. Lawson (Heriot-Watt), D. Mundici (U. Florence), J. Renault (U. Orleans),=
  P. Resende (Instituto Superior Tecnico), C. Starling (U. Ottawa), F. Wehru=
ng (U. Caen).

Contributed Talks: we are soliciting contributed talks. If you wish to give=
  a (30 minute) talk at the meeting, please send the organizers a title and =
short abstract before February 15. (In case your decision to attend and/or =
your access to travel funds depends on the acceptance of your talk, let us =
know and we will ensure a quick decision.)

Satellite Workshop: Immediately preceding our workshop, the analysis group =
in our department (Thierry Giordano, Vladimir Pestov and Charles Starling) =
will host a workshop entitled =93Operator Algebras and Dynamical Systems=94=
  (May 30 - June 1, Ottawa). The two workshops will coordinate and have some=
  invited speakers in common. Hence we strongly encourage participants to at=
tend both workshops.

tions, registration fees and procedures, maps and more:
