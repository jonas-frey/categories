Dear Vaughan,

Let me tell you how it really did occur for me - and I am happy to
proclaim this as true love, not locker-room boasting.

As you know from my book, at the end of the 80s I had learned from
Abramsky and Smyth, not to mention the topos-theorists, that frames
and topological spaces could be used to represent observational
theories (technically, propositional geometric theories). But all my
thinking was classical, even though I knew that frames could embody
non-classical logic. I assumed that one manipulated the frames within
a classical world.

I was investigating how one might understand predicate geometric
logic in a similar observational way, and this led me to my bagtopos
construction in "Geometric Theories and Databases". But even there, I
was thinking of formal logical manipulations in a classical world. In
particular, I was thinking of geometric morphisms as being defined by
formal translations of symbols to geometric formulae, similar to the
way I treated locale maps in my book.

It was Peter Johnstone who showed me a different way, with his paper
"Partial products, bagdomains and hyperlocal toposes". He generalized
my bagtoposes and described a universal property of them. He also
showed that his more general construction was, in the contexts where
mine was defined, equivalent to it. This equivalence involved
describing geometric morphisms between different classifying toposes,
and at that point I was expecting to see formal logical
transformations. But when I eventually understood his proof I saw
that he was doing something different and much more natural: he used
the internal mathematics of the toposes to show how models of the
geometric theories transform. This only works if the reasoning is
geometric, and from then on I have grown to love the geometric
reasoning better as a route to better understanding of toposes (and
locales too, for that matter). This is what I tried to explain in
"Locales and Toposes as Spaces", my chapter in the Handbook of
Spatial Logics.

As a parable, I think of toposes as gorillas (rather that elephants).
At first they look very fierce and hostile, and the locker-room
boasting is all tales of how you overpower the creature and take it
back to a zoo to live in a cage - if it's lucky enough not to have
been shot first. When it dies you stuff it, mount it in a threatening
pose with its teeth bared and display it in a museum to frighten the
children. But get to know them in the wild, and gain their trust,
then you begin to appreciate their gentleness and can play with them.

The gorilla in the cage is the topos in the classical world.

Best regards,

Steve.

Here's something that tickled me. A sign outside a monastery in
Meteora, Greece, says -

    "O topos einai ieros"

("The topos is holy")
