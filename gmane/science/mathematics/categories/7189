Hi Mark,

Nice work; thank you for the simple answer and good explanation.

I hope this isn't annoying, but what if I change the problem somewhat
and take DOF(C) to be the full subcategory of Cat_{C/} spanned by the
discrete opfibrations C-->D? Again I want to know whether DOF(C) has a
terminal object. Under this definition, by setting C=3Dempty-category we
get DOF(C)=3DCat, which does have a terminal object.

Thanks,
David

  D such that the cardinality of the set of all arrows with source x is that=
  of X. This contradicts the smallness of D.
