I have put some preprints on

http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/brownpr.html

1. Normalisation for the fundamental crossed complex of a simplicial
set. R. Brown and R. Sivera=20

This is but one more step in setting up crossed complexes as a basic
somewhat nonabelian tool in algebraic topology.
It shows how crossed complexes are used to express the homotopy addition
lemma, and gives an analogue of a theorem classical for simplicial
abelian groups.

2. Analogy, concepts and methodology in Mathematics. R. Brown and T. Porter

This is an an article for undergraduates to appear in Eureka, Journal of
the Archimideans at Cambridge. It is about rather than on mathematics.
It includes two quotations from a correspondence with Grothendieck. It
could be seen as relevant to the article `Mathematical Morality' by
Eugenia Cheng.
