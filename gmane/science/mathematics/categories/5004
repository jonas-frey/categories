As Peter Johnstone also emphasized in his reply, the construction which =20
David Spivak describes,
namely "T(S)=3D(k-Set \downarrow {S})",  is really a part of a well known=
=20
"monad" on the category of categories: if S is any category, T(S) is the=20
free cocompletion of S under k-small coproducts. It is only a monad up=20
to canonical isomorphisms, because coproducts are not in general=20
strictly associative. This cocompletion "monad"  under coproducts has=20
been widely studied under the name "Fam" (because T(S) is the category=20
of k-small Families of objects in S). It is an example of a KZ monad.

However,  replacing k-Set by k-Cat provides a monad on Cat which is not=20
KZ; David observes:

"(There is a similar monad on Cat, where we replace k-Set with k-Cat.)"

and Peter's reply to this:

"This is correct, and it's well-known: it is the monad which freely adjoi=
ns
k-small coproducts to a category. "

does not apply here (it slipped into the wrong place of his reply):=20
rather, David's "similar monad" is trying to provide free cocompletion=20
under colimits indexed by k-small categories, but does not, until you=20
make a category-of-fractions construction on its values. My University=20
of Chicago thesis (1967) described this way of making free cocompletions.

This "similar monad" (before doing the fractions-part) has  been studied=20
by Guitart, he calls it this monad DIAG. Reference: Guitart, Ren=E9,=20
