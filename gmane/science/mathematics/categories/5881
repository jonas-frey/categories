Dear James,

There is a pretty obviuous way to formalize it, but very few does it. It's
the existence/construction thing. "Free" is an angel and devil is in the
detail.

What I mean is just to construct each F_m and see what happens in this
transfinite induction. At the end you pick up all F_m's to produce F =
\cup_m F_m, and formulating F_m is the main formalizing part.

When you do this over C=Set, it looks natural, and almost canonic, but
when moving over to other C's it is not all that jazz.

Many will say, yes, it's already in the literature, "it's been there for
the past 50 years", "everything is pretty standard", and so on and so
forth. This angelic self-confidence makes no good in your case, I
believe(!). You need to work out the filtered steps and complete the
transfinite induction. eta : id -> F often behaves, and is sometimes even
unique, and obviously mu : F o F -> F requires detail.

We are doing these things for the term monad. Let me know if you need some
references. In your case your are a bit more abstract algebra, and terms
mean you are more universal algebra, but that shouldn't make any
difference, I guess.

Cheers,

Patrik
