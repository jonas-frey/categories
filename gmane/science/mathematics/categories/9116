Dear Steve,

I totally agree with you.
Let me apply  your zoological criteria to Category Theory. You begin =20
with the very simple notions of category, functor and natural  =20
transformation. But then you start piling in subclauses such as =20
categories with finite limits, or regular, or abelian, or the glorious =20=

toposes. For functors you refine the notion to fully faithful ones or =20=

those who have an adjoint, or are flat, or are fibrations. I could =20
give hundreds of examples, and even a meticulous zoologist would =20
say:To much is to much!
Obviously Category Theory is very bad and the very idea of putting in  =20=

a same bag groups, topological spaces, locales, and the glorious =20
toposes is a misconception.
Serious mathematicians agreed with this. You are too young to remember =20=

the time when these mathematicians called, with zoological =20
justification, this theory :  Abstract general nonsense.

All the best,

Jean
