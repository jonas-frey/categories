Due to an editing error on my part some of you will have received four
posts from Jim Stasheff with no subject line, and in some cases (as Nimish
Shah pointed out to Jim, who also alerted me) spam filters will have
prevented delivery. With apologies to Jim, these messages are repeated
below (except for some of the material repeated from earlier posts).

Since I will be away from email access there will be an interruption in
postings to this list until Wednesday starting a little more than 24 hours
from now. Several new items in the current thread will be posted shortly,
and responses to them arriving in the next day will be posted, but I would
encourage you not to submit further items for posting until after
Wednesday.

best wishes, Bob Rosebrugh

Mostly well said, David
I would only modify/deform ;-) what you say
by doubting therte are that many physicists
who are anti-cat theory (not pro-)
but watch out
once some leader of the school adopts it
the school will follow - much faster than if they were mathematicians

It's not so much the applications that seduce some of us
but rather the *new* structures the physicists suggest that turn
out to have neat mathemaical, e.g. categorical, aspects.
e.g quantum groups

Consider instead what happened in algebraic topology in the last century
(or in  invariant theory of polynomial forms in the previous one):
classic internal problems e.g. homotopy groups of spheres ground on and
on while the enthusiasm and excitement of `application' motivated
problems died with a lack of such problems (I have in mind vector fields
on spheres and allsorts of diff geom motivations).

Exactly - if it's good math, it's not tainted by being invented by
physicists.

For that remember (if any are as old as I)
matrices good, groups bad
