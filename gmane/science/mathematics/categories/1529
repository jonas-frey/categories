LOCATION AND SIGHTSEEING TOURS

    Georgia is the ancient country situated between Black and Caspian seas,
the Caucasus  and Turkey. It is the country of the Golden Fleece, the myth of
Argonauts, Jason and Medea, and Prometheus, chained to the Caucasus mountains.
Tbilisi - capital of Georgia - has more than 1 million in habitant. It is
situated some 100-150 km to the south of main Caucasus ridge, in the
beautiful valley of the river Mtkvari, surrounded by the green slopes of the
Caucasus spurs. The city has a long (1500 year old) history and abounds in
historical and cultural memorials. Georgia is famous for its high quality
wines, exquisite cuisine and cordial hospitality.

The main site of the Symposium, Tbilisi State University, is the chief
centre of education in the country, and has several outstanding scholars
in science, art and politics among its graduates.

During the School there will be an excursion over the famous Georgian
Military Road, which leads us through the  ancient capital of Georgia -
Mtskheta, with its abundant architectural and historical monuments - and
which brings us across the main ridge of the Caucasus by the Cross Pass.
The destination of the envisaged trip is the  mountain resort Kazbegi
with its Trinity Church situated on the top of high peak facing the second
mountain (after Elbrus), the peak of the Caucasus - Mkinvarcveri
(Glacier - mountain).


 TRAVEL INFORMATION

Tbilisi can only be reached  by air. If there are no direct trip between your
point of departure and Tbilisi, the most convenient connections are via
Istambul, Frankfurt or Moscow.
