Dear all,

Thanks for the useful responses. My reading of the---admittedly
extensive---Isbell corpus was clearly not (left or right) adequate. To
summarise, the original published references where things are done, by
Isbell, with Isbell envelopes (under the name "couple categories")
appear to be:

[1] John R. Isbell, Structure of categories, Bulletin of the American
Mathematical Society 72 (1966), 619=E2=80=93 655.
[2] John R. Isbell, Normal completions of categories, Reports of the
Midwest Category Seminar, vol. 47, Springer, 1967, 110=E2=80=93155.

while Vaughan Pratt also draws attention to their appearance in:

[3] Vaughan Pratt, Communes via Yoneda, from an elementary perspective,
Fundamenta Informaticae 103 (2010), 203=E2=80=93218.

There are, of course, related constructions in linear logic, and in fact
the Isbell envelope turns up, after a fashion, in the Chu appendix to
Mike Barr's "Star-autonomous categories" (there called, again, the
"double envelope").
