I was just looking at Grothendieck's statement about schemes in EGA 3:

Pour obtenir un langage qui ``colle" sans effort =E0 l'intuition=20
g\'{e}om\'{e}trique, et \'{e}viter des circonlocutions
insupportables \`{a} la longue, nous identifions toujours un=20
pr\'{e}sch\'{e}ma $X$ sur un autre $S$ au foncteur
\mbox{\clarrow{(\mathrm{Sch}/S)^\mathrm{o}}{\mathrm{Ens}}} qu'il=20
repr\'{e}sente,

"To make the language stick to geometric intuition, and to avoid finally=20
unbearable circumlocutions, we will always identify a scheme X over another=
=20
S, with the functor from Sch/S to Set that it represents."

This quote is from the Springer Verlag edition page VI. This edition was=20
printed in 1970. I do not yet know if it is printed in the earlier IHES=20
edition.

The IHES edition of EGA chapter 0, printed in  1960, does urge the=20
functorial rather than topological space conception of a sheaf. "We=20
systematically abstain from using espaces etales ... we never consider a=20
sheaf a topological space"  (p. 25).

best, Colin
