Dear Albert,

I "half agree" with you. The term "matrix" has been used by by Freyd-=20
Scedrov in their allegories, by myself in my paper on distributors, =20
and probably by many other persons.
However in both cases the situation was such that one could define =20
the "product" of two matrixes and get an allegory or more generally a =20=

bi-category, and I suggest it should be restricted to such cases. In =20
the general situation where the product is not defined, I suggest the =20=

word "array" (with entries in C, if we want to specify C)

Bonnne Ann=E9e,
Jean
