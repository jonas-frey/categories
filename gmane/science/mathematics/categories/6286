By definition (at least according to the usage under discussion),
something necessarily preserved by all morphisms is a "property,"
although it can also be regarded as a particular degenerate case of a
structure and, I guess, also a degenerate case of a property-like
structure.

property =3D forgetful functor is full and faithful
structure =3D forgetful functor is faithful
property-like structure =3D forgetful functor is pseudomonic
