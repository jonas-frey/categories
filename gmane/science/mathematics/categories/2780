IMPORTANT DATES

November 21, 2005    Deadline for submissions
January 16, 2006     Notification of acceptance
February 16, 2006    Final version in electronic form
April 1-2, 2006      Workshop in Vienna


AIMS AND SCOPE

Rewriting logic (RL) is a natural model of computation and an expressive
semantic framework for concurrency, parallelism, communication and
interaction. It can be used for specifying a wide range of systems and
languages in various application fields. It also has good properties as a
metalogical framework for representing logics. In recent years, several
languages based on RL (ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been designed
and implemented. The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers
with a common interest in RL and its applications, and to give them the
opportunity to present their recent works, discuss future research
directions, and exchange ideas.

The topics of the workshop comprise, but are not limited to,

* foundations and models of RL;
* languages based on RL, including implementation issues;
* RL as a logical framework;
* RL as a semantic framework, including applications of RL to
   - object-oriented systems,
   - concurrent and/or parallel systems,
   - interactive, distributed, open ended and mobile systems,
   - specification of languages and systems;
* formalisms related to RL, including
   - real-time and probabilistic extensions of RL,
   - tile logic,
   - rewriting approaches to behavioral specifications;
* verification techniques for RL specifications, including
   - equational and coherence methods, and
   - verification of properties expressed in first-order, higher-order,
     modal and temporal logics;
* comparisons of RL with existing formalisms having analogous aims;
* application of RL to specification and analysis of
   - distributed systems,
   - physical systems.


PAST EVENTS

Previous WRLA workshops have been organized in

  - Asilomar, California,    September 3-6, 1996
  - Pont-a-Mousson, France,  September 1-4, 1998
  - Kanazawa, Japan,         September 18-20, 2000

The proceedings of the WRLA workshops have been published as
volumes 4, 15, 36, 71, and 117 in the Elsevier ENTCS series, available at

       http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/15710661

Selected papers from WRLA'96 have been published in
a special issue of Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 285(2), 2002,
and selected papers from WRLA 2004 will appear in a special issue of
Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation.

LOCATION

WRLA 2006 will be held in Vienna, Austria in March 25-26, 2006. It is
a satellite  workshop of ETAPS 2006, the European Joint Conferences on
Theory and Practice of Software. For venue, registration and suggested
accommodation see the ETAPS 2006 web page

             http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/etaps06


SUBMISSIONS

Submissions will be evaluated by the Program Committee for inclusion
in the proceedings, which will be available at the time of the workshop
and are expected to be published in the Elsevier ENTCS series.

Papers must contain original contributions, be clearly written, and include
appropriate reference to and comparison with related work.  They must be
unpublished and not submitted simultaneously for publication
elsewhere. Papers (of at most 15 pages, at least 10 point font) should be
submitted electronically, preferably as PDF files, to the workshop email
address

            wrla06@csl.sri.com

providing also a text-only abstract, and detailed contact information
of the corresponding author.

The final program of the workshop will also include system demonstrations
and invited presentations to be determined.

Based on the quality and interest of the accepted papers, the program
committee will consider the possibility of preparing a special issue of a
scientific journal in the field.
