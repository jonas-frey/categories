                      International Symposium on
Foundations of Health Information Engineering and Systems
                (http://www.iist.unu.edu/ICTAC/FHIES2011/)

                   (Colocated with ICTAC 2011)


Information and communication technology plays an increasingly enabling
role in addressing the global challenges of healthcare, in both the
developed and the developing world, that are the concern of the United
Nations, its Peoples and Members States. The use of software in medical
devices is already raising issues in relation to safety and efficacy for
manufacturers and regulators. Health information systems raise issues of
both privacy and confidentiality, on the one hand, and, increasingly,
patient safety on the other. Hospital and other information systems
raise important issues of efficacy and interoperability. However, to
capitalize on the potential of this technology in reshaping healthcare
demands focused research on sound and safe development techniques from
software engineering, electronic engineering, computing science,
information science, mathematics, and industrial engineering.

Aims
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The purpose of the new symposium series on Foundations of Software
Engineering Health Informatics (FHIES) is to promote a nascent research
area that aims to develop and apply theories and techniques in computing
science and software engineering to modelling, building and certifying
software based systems in the application domain of healthcare. Many of
these systems are already regulated in many jurisdictions and many more
of them will become regulated in the future.

Research on theories, techniques and tools of software modelling,
verification and validation has been an important area of computer
science and software engineering, known as Formal Methods. This research
addresses the challenging problem of design and certification of safety
or mission critical software systems through
abstraction and decomposition techniques based on the use of
mathematical modelling theories and sound engineering methods. Formal
methods have primarily addressed the correctness of systems used in the
industrial, financial, and defence applications. However, they have
recently found application in modelling and analysis of complex systems
that involve interacting behaviour of many kinds of objects and agents,
including software systems, physical objects and humans. The models of
these systems have both discrete and continuous behaviour, and both
qualitative and quantitative (e.g., spatial timing and probabilistic)
properties. It is believed that these methods can be used for modelling
problems of health informatics, which presents the challenge of scalabili=
ty.

Software plays a critical role in sustainable health care, both as part
of the solution and as part of the problem. Software intensive
information systems are needed to support the collection and processing
of vast amounts of data via different devices, and allow policy makers
to access and share these data, and to support their decision making and
validation. Software systems can be developed for managing, controlling
and monitoring policies, processes and workflows in medical systems.
Software systems can be developed to help create the sophisticated
medical devices that are simply impossible to build without the
software. On the other hand, the application of software raises
challenging issues in safety, security and privacy, and increases the
complexity of healthcare workflows and the need for new business policies=
.

Paper Submissions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

We solicit high quality submissions reporting on

    1. original research contributions (18 pages maximum in LNCS format)
    2. application experience, case studies and software prototypes
       (18 pages maximum in LNCS format)
    3. surveys, comparisons, and state-of-the-art reports
       (18 pages maximum in LNCS format)
    4. position papers that define research projects with identified
       challenges and milestones (10 pages maximum in LNCS format)
    5. proposals for panel discussions, with at least three named
       panellists, about a topical question (5 pages maximum in LNCS
       format).

All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution
to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the
conference. Submissions should be in English, prepared in the LNCS
format (see here for details). Submission constitutes a commitment to
attend and present a paper, if accepted.

All accepted papers will be included in the pre-event proceedings of the
symposium. It is the plan to publish the post event proceedings either
by ACM or Springer in the LNCS series, and it will include all the
accepted submissions, EXCEPT FOR the proposals for panel discussions.
The post proceedings will include a brief summary of panel discussions.
