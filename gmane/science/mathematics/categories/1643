This is a reminder about the submission deadline for:

   Fifth International Conference on
 Typed Lambda-Calculi and Applications

which will be held in Krakow, Poland, May 2nd-5th, 2001.

The deadline is: OCTOBER 9TH 2000.

The scientific scope of TLCA is quite broad, and includes topics from
proof theory and semantics to types and logical frameworks, and
functional and logic programming.

The original call-for-papers follows:

********************************************************

The TLCA series of conferences aims at providing a forum for the
presentation and discussion of current research in a field which was
originally rather restricted, but has now expanded considerably.
Typical areas include, but are not limited to:

Proof theory: 
Natural Deduction and Sequent Calculi, Cut elimination and
Normalization, Computational interpretations of Classical Logic, 
Linear Logic and Proof Nets, Bounded systems capturing complexity
classes

Semantics: 
Denotational semantics, Operational semantics, Game  semantics,
Realizability, Categorical models, Logical Relations, Full Completeness

Implementation:
Abstract machines, Parallel execution, Optimal Reduction

Types:
Polymorphism, Dependent types, Intersection types, Subtypes

Logical Foundations:
Logical Frameworks, Pure Type Systems, Proof checking

Programming:
Foundational aspects of: Functional programming, Proof search and logic
programming, Connections between and combinations of functional and
logic programming, Type checking, Higher-order rewriting, Higher-order
unification and matching


Important Dates
===============

Deadline for Submissions:   October 9, 2000

Submission Guidelines
=====================

Papers should not exceed 15 standard A4 or US quarto pages, and should
allow the Programme Committee to assess the merits of the work: in
particular, references and comparisons with related work should be
included. Submission of material already published or submitted to other
conferences with published proceedings is not allowed.
If available, e-mail addresses and fax numbers of the authors should be
included.

sent to this address in a **separate** e-mail: Title; authors; 
communicating author's name, address, and e-mail address and 
fax number if available; abstract of paper.

Hard-copy submissions
=====================

If electronic submission is not possible, authors may submit five (5)
hard copies of the paper by post to the following address:
