As Phil Scott immediately pointed out to me, the proof of this
folklore result appears in a 2000 slide by Masahito Hasegawa entitled
"A short proof of the uniqueness of trace on tortile categories", see

 http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~hassei/papers/canonicaltrace.gif

and also on p.23 in a paper by the same author that is to appear in
MSCS, entitled "On traced monoidal closed categories":
