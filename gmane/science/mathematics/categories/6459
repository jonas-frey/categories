And actually even "product-preserving" is only a loose and not entirely
appropriate slogan for the actual condition I promulgated in that work.

I always thought that "generalized topology" was the result of caving in
to a similar *manner-of-speaking* abbreviatory impulse, and I suppose
today's "generalized Ehresmann sketch" is, as well.

No harm done, of course ... :-) . Cheers,
