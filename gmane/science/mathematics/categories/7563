Dear Dongning Wang,

an orbifold is a special case of a stack on the relevant site, say
that of smooth manifolds. The general theory of principal bundles,
group representations and associated fiber bundles in the context of
higher stacks is discussed in

Thomas Nikolaus, Urs Schreiber, Danny Stevenson,
"Principal infinity-bundles"
arxiv.org/abs/1207.0248
ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/infinity+bundles

The construction that you are after is in section 4.1 there.

See also section 3.6.10, 3.6.11 of

Urs Schreiber
"Differential cohomology in a cohesive infinity-topos"
ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos

All the best,
Urs
