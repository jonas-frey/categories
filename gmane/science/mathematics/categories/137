Certainly, yust consider algebraic lattices with their Scott topology. They are
all sober and connected. P(\kappa) for all cardinals \kappa provides a class
of nonisomorphic such gadgets.

BTW Bob suggested to characterise when two sober spaces or locales are
logically indistinguishible. I find this a most difficult questions. Reminds me
a bit (admittedly somewhat vague analogy) of characterising elementary
equivalence of structures. There is an answer by Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games.
But this can't be use for the question at issue.
