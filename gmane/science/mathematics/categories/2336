the point is that tableau calculus may be best understood as a search for
cut-free proofs in either classical or intuitionistic logic; this fact is
systematically overlooked in the literature on tableaux methods like in the
logic programming community one hardly ever finds exposed the view that
executing a logic program is nothing but unravelling an inductive definition

for information on tableau methods from a proof-theoretic point of view see
Troelstra & van Dalen's book "Constructivism in Mathematics" vol.2, the chapter
on proof theory of intuitionistic logic
