A list member claims in a private communication to me that 3 things are =
wrong with the x/y to 1 - x + y conversion. His first claim is that "it =
does not ring true" that I meant to type k1 or k2. This criticism is =
outside mathematics and has no meaning either there or in science.

His second claim is that xy =3D (x/y)y^^2 works one way and (x/y)^^2 =
(y^^3)/x works another way in the conversion and that the conversion of =
/ but not other operations is anyway of questionable validity. =
Concerning the second part, the claim is meaningless. Since x/y is the =
main "animal" in BCP and in Goguen/Product logic implication and both =
have the form x/y, there is nothing to prevent me from comparing x/y =
with 1 - x + y in order to compare BCP and Goguen/Product logic =
implications with LBP and Lukaciewicz Logic. Concerning the first part, =
we can define a conversion C_n which converts xy as a product of =
(x/y)^^n g(x,y) where g(x,y) is a rational expression in powers of y =
and/or x no part of which contains (x/y)^^m as a factor for 1 < =3D m < =
=3D n and m, n are integers > =3D 1. C_n (C subscript n) for n =3D 1 =
gives exactly my conversion, and the critic's objection case involves =
C_2 which conversion is not being considered.

The third argument is that the conversion restricted to x/y for x, y =
coprime integers is alarming (because) continuity is lost (that is to =
say, I should mention, that the rationals are not continuous while the =
reals are) and because it is unclear how to apply the conversion to =
expressions of the form xy (is xy to be the product of two coprime =
integers or what?). This is really two objections except for the word =
"alarming" which is not a word in mathematics or science. The first =
objection, concerning continuity, implicitly assumes that the conversion =
is required to be continuous. Although I used the conversion earlier to =
attempt to convert xy in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) xy > =
k, which perhaps should "ideally" involve all real xy, if the critic =
admits that the conversion works for rational x and y or even integer x =
and y, then xy restricted to either rational or integer x and y converts =
to two different inequalities depending on whether 1 - x + y < 0 or 1 - =
x + y > 0 (respectively x > 1 + y or x < 1 + y), so the converted form =
of xy does not obey the HUP, and therefore continuity is not even =
required to show what I had attempted to show about the HUP. The second =
objection, concerning whether xy is restricted to the product of two =
coprime integers, is rather redundant considering the above.

Yours truly,

Osher Doctorow=20
