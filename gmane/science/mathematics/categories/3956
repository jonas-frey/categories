The awesome nature of Sup cannot be the reason why
the Kummer functor exists, since it is merely used for=20
recording the result. The functor is "caused" rather=20
by an internal feature of the domain category C of=20
commutative rings:  The category of quotient objects
of any given R has a binary operation * that is neither
sup nor inf even though in principle it can be=20
expressed as a combination of limits and colimits.
We can call it R/ab=3DR/a *R/b but how does the=20
operation * specialize to C concretely ?
