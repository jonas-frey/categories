it's interesting that almost no one took michael healy's bait (attached).
a couple of years ago, a similar question started a long battle between a
group of categorists from this list, and a group of set theorists on
another list. traces of that battle can still be found scattered on the
web.

i guess people got a bit tired. after all, for a working mathematician,
foundations are a bit like esperanto: ok, all math can be translated to
set theory, or to category theory, or to untyped lambda calculus --- so
what? do foundations help me calculate an integral? does anyone use von
neumann representation of numbers in arithmetic? no.

but guys, note that the question this time comes from cs.boeing.com! if
people at boeing think about categories, and sets, and foundations, then
this probably makes a difference for them, and helps them compute
something. might this not be worth your attention?

so let me say what i think. i think foundations mean different things for
different people.

for logicians, foundations are metamathematics: analyzing consistency,
independance etc of logical theories. this is what set theory was found to
be good for.

category theory, on the other hand, is not as handy for proving new
independence results, but it tells you to look for adjunctions everywhere,
or monads, or <the keyword from your last paper>. it is not
metamathematics, but perhaps *structuralist maths*: it displays abstract
structures... (i kno, this is getting to *just* the kind of philosophy you
were hoping to avoid by the synchronized silence. so let me make the
point.)

for software engineers, foundations are the link with the meaning of their
programs. having a slightly shorter history than math, they do not have
languages as natural as arithmetic, or calculus, but have to chose between
KIF and Ontolingua, and the various other versions of esperanto every day.
categories dam the flood of structure in software engineering, just like
they originally did in homology theory almost 60 years ago. some good math
may come out of it if taken from a good side.
