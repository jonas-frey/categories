Many papers on category theory cite
Jean B=C3=A9nabou, Les distributeurs, Universit=C3=A9 Catholique de Louvain=
,
Institut de Math=C3=A9matique Pure et Appliqu=C3=A9e, rapport 33, 1973.
For some reason (hint: anybody know why?)
this seems never to have been published.
Would it not be a good idea to publish it as a TAC Reprint,
in view of both
its current scientific/mathematical value and
its value as a seminal source for many subsequent developments?

As an example of what is being said about it on the web,
the following is quoted from the nlab page on profunctors as of this date:

The original published source for profunctors is
Jean B=C3=A9nabou, Les distributeurs, Universit=C3=A9 Catholique de Louvain=
,
Institut de Math=C3=A9matique Pure et Appliqu=C3=A9e, rapport 33, 1973
based on several series of lectures starting in 1969, but these notes
are hard to come by. They are available from the author by request.
Much (if not most) of the existing work on profunctors has been
developed by B=C3=A9nabou.

I don't know the politics of getting it reprinted,
but simply on scientific and historical grounds,
it seems that would be a very good idea,
and one I am by this email requesting.
Further, perish the thought, we are all mortal,
and the issue arises how future generations might have access to
a work that is cited so frequently.

Best, Keith
