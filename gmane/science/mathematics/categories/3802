Announcement of a workshop on

   CATEGORICAL QUANTUM LOGIC

   August 11-12
   Oxford University

Invited speakers:

* Rick Blute (Ottawa, Canada)
* Marcelo Fiore (Cambridge, UK)
* John Harding (New Mexico, US)
* Chris Isham (Imperial College, UK)

This workshop will be partly adjacent to and partly interleaved with one
on
COALGEBRAIC LOGIC which takes place August 10-11 and is organised
by Alexander Kurz, and both of these are preceded by the conference
ALGEBRAIC AND TOPOLOGICAL METHODS IN NON-CLASSICAL LOGICS:

* http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/notices/events/special/tancl07/

which takes place August 5-9 and is organised by Hilary Priestley and Mai
Gehrke, and at which:

* Samson Abramsky (Oxford, UK)

will be giving an invited address on his work in the area of categorical
quantum logic.
