Wow!  Thanks for _all_ the replies.  I certainly learnt a lot very quickly
just then.  The students seemed to get the basic idea - assuming that I didn't
mangle it.  One or two seemed to know a bit of category theory and so were
able to see a bit further than the others.

So thanks again.  Particularly, I'm very pleased that I was able to have an
answer for the next class.  I guess that the time zone helped there but even
so it was great to have so many answers so fast.

Andrew
