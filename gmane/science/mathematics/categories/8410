Dear all,

I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that fresh Erasmus Mundus
scholarships are available for Non-European AND European students who
enrol in our European Master's Program in Computational Logic in the
fall of 2015. The deadline for application is 31 January, 2015. More
details are given below.

Please spread this information as wide as possible among friends and
colleagues, at your old universities and the places, where you currently
live and work.

Many thanks -- Steffen
