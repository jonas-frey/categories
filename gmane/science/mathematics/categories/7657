Call for Course and Workshop Proposals

              ESSLLI 2014

26th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information

         Tuebingen, Germany

         August 11-22, 2014

------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT DATES
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

15 June 2013:      Proposal submission deadline
15 September 2013: Notification
1 June 2014:       Course material due


TOPICS AND FORMAT
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Proposals for courses and workshops at ESSLLI'2014 are invited in all
areas of Logic, Linguistics and Computing and Information Sciences.
Cross-disciplinary and innovative topics are particularly encouraged.

Each course and workshop will consist of five 90 minute sessions,
offered daily (Monday-Friday) in a single week.  Proposals for two-week
courses should be structured and submitted as two independent one-week
courses, e.g. as an introductory course followed by an advanced one.
In such cases, the ESSLLI program committee reserves the right to accept
just one of the two proposals.

All instructional and organizational work at ESSLLI is performed
completely on a voluntary basis, so as to keep participation fees to a
minimum.  However, organizers and instructors have their registration
fees waved, and are reimbursed for travel and accommodation expenses
up to a level to be determined and communicated with the proposal
notification.  ESSLLI can only guarantee reimbursement for at most one
course/workshop organizer, and can not guarantee full reimbursement of
travel costs for lecturers or organizers from outside of Europe.  The
ESSLLI organizers would appreciate any help in controlling the
School's expenses by seeking complete coverage of travel and
accommodation expenses from other sources.


CATEGORIES
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Each proposal should fall under one of the following categories.


* FUNDAMENTAL COURSES *

Such courses are designed to present the basics of a research area, to
people with no prior knowledge in that area.  They should be of =
elementary
level, without prerequisites in the course's topic, though possibly
assuming a level of general scientific maturity in the relevant
discipline.  They should enable researchers from related disciplines
to develop a level of comfort with the fundamental concepts and
techniques of the course's topic, thereby contributing to the
interdisciplinary nature of our research community.


* INTRODUCTORY COURSES *

Introductory courses are central to ESSLLI's mission.  They are
intended to introduce a research field to students, young researchers,
and other non-specialists, and to foster a sound understanding of its
basic methods and techniques. Such courses should enable researchers
from related disciplines to develop some comfort and competence in the
topic considered.  Introductory courses in a cross-disciplinary area
may presuppose general knowledge of the related disciplines.


* ADVANCED COURSES *

Advanced courses are targeted primarily to graduate students who wish
to acquire a level of comfort and understanding in the current research =
of a field.


* WORKSHOPS *

Workshops focus on specialized, usually topics of current
interest. Workshops organizers are responsible for soliciting papers
and selecting the workshop program. They are also responsible for =
publishing proceedings if they decide to have proceedings.



PROPOSAL GUIDELINES
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Course and workshop proposals should follow closely the following =
guidelines to ensure full consideration.

Each course may have no more than two instructors, and each workshop

monographs in the area.  Proposals for advanced courses should specify =
the prerequisites in detail.

o General proposal information: Title, category

o Contents information
*  Abstract of up to 150 words
*  Motivation and description (up to two pages)
*  Tentative outline
*  Expected level and prerequisites
*  Appropriate references
(e.g. textbooks, monographs, proceedings, surveys)

o Practical information:
*  Relevant preceding meetings and events, if applicable
*  Potential external funding for participants
