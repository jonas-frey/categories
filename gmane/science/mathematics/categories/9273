Dear All.=20

The philosophy I have followed in essence since 1974 is now articulated in =
my Indag Math. paper recently advertised on this list "Modelling and Comput=
ing Homotopy Types: I" (see my preprint page) and involves strict structure=
s and homotopically defined functors on "Topological Data", satisfying a Se=
ifert-van Kampen type theorem, which enables explicit computations relating=
  to classical methods in homotopy theory, e.g. relative and n-adic homotopy=
  groups.=20

I spent the years 1965 -1974 trying to construct a homotopy double groupoid=
  of a space, and just getting confused, and even unsure what to do with it =
if I got it, so it was a great relief to get, as explained in that paper, t=
o get with Philip Higgins a nice definition for a pointed pair of spaces, w=
hich did all we wanted!=20

The extension to filtered spaces took another 3 or 4 years with Philip Higg=
ins, and then with Loday for n-cubes of pointed spaces another 3-4 years. A=
ll this related well to classical homotopy theory (and algebraic K-theory!)=
  methods.=20

Note that in Section 5 of Esquisses d'un Programme, Grothendieck argues tha=
t extra structure is needed on topological spaces (if you like, moving from=
  "bare" topological spaces) to make them suitable for geometric work. Perha=
ps this reflects the difficulty I had 1965-74 in expressing my homotopy int=
uitions in mathematical form. though the algebraic work in dim 2  went ahea=
d with Chris Spencer, in the early 1970s.=20

The work of Ellis and Steiner on crossed n-cubes of groups gives an amazing=
ly precise, explicit,  strict model for n-types of pointed spaces, enabling=
  for example, with the van Kampen theorem for diagrams of spaces, the solut=
ion of an old problem (John Moore, Barratt-Whitehead) of the critical group=
  for n-ads. There seem some possibilities for crossed n-cubes of groupoids!=
  Further work is need on applications to excision. which should have been p=
ursued by me (with students, for example)  years ago!=20

One aspect of the work with Loday. a nonabelian tensor product, has been we=
ll taken up by group theorists. see my on-line bibliography. The applicatio=
n of that construction to the low dimensional Blakers-Massey theorem change=
d radically the views on this area of at least one well known algebraic top=
ologist  (he had previously described the generalised van Kampen programme =
as "ridiculous"!). =20

Subject : categories: n-types and n-fold structures

Dear All,

    With regard to the recent postings about modelling general n-types and n=
-fold groupoids, I would like to point out the following. A proof of the mo=
delling of general n-types (not only path-connected ones) using n-fold stru=
ctures is given in the following research monograph, which I recently poste=
d  on arVix:

S.Paoli, Segal-type models of higher categories, arXiv.1707.01868

The structure used there, called groupoidal weakly globular n-fold categori=
es, is a subcategory of n-fold categories in which certain sub-structures a=
re groupoidal, and satisfying several other conditions. This result is a pr=
oof of the homotopy hypothesis for a new model of weak n-categories, called=
   weakly globular n-fold categories, which is proved to be suitably equival=
ent to the Tamsamani-Simpson model.

In the above work there is also a proof that it is possible to use as funda=
mental functor from spaces to groupoidal weakly globular n-fold categories =
the construction found in the following paper

D. Blanc, S. Paoli, Segal-type algebraic models of n-types, Algebraic and G=
eometric Topology, 14  3419=E2=80=933491.

This construction produces a functor from spaces to a subcategory of n-fold=
   groupoids.

Best wishes,

Simona.
