It surprises me as much as anyone, but the price of eschewing LaTeX
seems to be to wind up learning a smattering of HTML ... and of PS (!).

Or so I must infer from the nature of the talk I'm giving either to
geometers or to mathematical pedagogues at the upcoming ICM -- entitled
"A piecewise cubic PostScript trefoil", it offers a piecewise polynomial =

parametrization of the trefoil knot -- a continuously differentiable =

stitching together of six rotated and reflected copies of one basic =

pattern-curve arising as part of the graph of a well-chosen cubic =

polynomial that any basic linear algebra student can come up with.

The cute trick is that you don't need any fluency in linear algebra
technique at all -- PostScript will do it all for you -- solve your
problem, plot your cubic curve, and rotate and reflect it, as much as
is required.

And enjoy, with a nice, cool, mint julep :-) .
