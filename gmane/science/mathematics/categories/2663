I'm not entirely sure I follow what Vaughan's project is here, so this
may come out as a non sequitur, but:  Surely, from time to time,
categorists must care about genuinely ultra-first-order notions, such as
(say) the metric completeness of the real numbers?  To me the natural
way of getting such notions right is to make sure that each of your
universes is closed under the (true) powerset operation.  That would
require the cardinality of your universes to be, at least, strong limit
cardinals.

Having them closed under ranges of functions also seems natural enough;
at that point you need inaccessibles.

It's by no means clear that inaccessibles are sufficient.  What happens
when you want to be closed under the operation of finding the next
larger inaccessible?
