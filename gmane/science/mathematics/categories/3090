Hi,

I just came across the following pages

http://motls.blogspot.com/2004/11/category-theory-and-physics.html
http://motls.blogspot.com/2004/11/this-week-208-analysis.html

written by Lubos Motl, a physicist (string theorist). Some of you may find
these articles interesting and probably revealing.

Are we category theorists as a whole going to quietly accept getting
discredited by a minority of us presumably applying category theory to
string theory? It is surely not too late to react and point out that this is
not what (all of) category theory is about. Please give a thought about what
we, as a community, can urgently do to repair this damaging impression.
Unless we are prepared to wait until things change by themselves within our
lifetime.


Hopefully disturbing your weekend,
Cordially,
Marta
