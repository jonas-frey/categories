           CATEGORY THEORY AND COMPUTER SCIENCE (CTCS'99)
              10-12 SEPTEMBER 1999, EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND

                        FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS 


CTCS '99 is the 8th conference on Category Theory and Computer
Science. The purpose of the conference series is the advancement of
the foundations of computing using the tools of category theory. While
the emphasis is upon applications of category theory, it is recognized
that the area is highly interdisciplinary.

Typical topics of interest include but are not limited to
category-theoretic aspects of the following:

concurrent and distributed systems 
constructive mathematics
declarative programming and term rewriting 
domain theory and topology
linear logic 
models of computation 
program logics, data refinement, and specification 
programming language semantics 
type theory

Previous meetings have been held in Guildford (Surrey), Edinburgh,
Manchester, Paris, Amsterdam, Cambridge, and S. Margherita Ligure
(Genova).
