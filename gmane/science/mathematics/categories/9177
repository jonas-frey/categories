Assistant Professor, Mathematics

Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Faculty of Science

Dalhousie University invites applicants for a probationary tenure
track position in Mathematics from outstanding candidates with a
strong background in the mathematical modelling of programming
languages and in quantum computing.

The candidates should have demonstrated ability or potential for
teaching excellence and establishing a successful research
program. The successful candidate will have a PhD in the Mathematical
Sciences.  Expertise in type theory, category theory, mathematical
logic, and/or number theoretic methods in quantum information theory
will be an asset. In addition to carrying out their independent
research program, the successful candidate will be expected to join an
existing research project on the design, semantics, and formal
verification of programming languages for quantum computing.

The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Dalhousie University
is at the forefront of research developments in the semantics of
quantum programming languages, categorical quantum mechanics, quantum
circuit theory, and unitary approximation. The division of Mathematics
also has strong research groups in category theory, commutative
algebra, harmonic analysis, cosmology, dynamical systems, graphs and
games, and differential geometry. The department has a flourishing
graduate program and a strong undergraduate Honours program.

The start date for the position is September 1, 2017.

Consideration of candidates will begin on April 30, 2017, and will
continue until the position is filled.  Complete applications will
