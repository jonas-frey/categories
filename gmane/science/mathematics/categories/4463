I would like to call the attention of the categorical community to the
very interesting post
http://www.fermentmagazine.org/Quest88.html
It reports the successful quest in 1988 of Roy Lisker to meet
Grothendieck.

I first met Roy nearly 55 years ago when we were in a HS math club.  I
lost track of him for several decades and then met him again in Peter
Freyd's office at Penn, probably in 1990.  Since then I have had desultory
e-contact with him (plus running into him once in person).  I read
this then, but he has now posted it online.  Eventually, I will put a copy
on my own ftp site.

Michael
