If memory serves me, Nerode proved years ago that the necessary and
sufficient condition that all the algebraic closures of a field are
effectively isomorphic is that its polynomials effectively factor into
irreducibles.

As for the later, the ancient theorem is that if a unique
factorization domain has only finitely many units and if the
factorization is effective then so it is for its polynomial ring.

The condition on units pretty much forces the proof.
