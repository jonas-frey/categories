If one assumes that epics split and that
the Boolean algebra of subsets of 1
reduces to two elements, then (to a
first approximation) the main effect
of axiom schemes is to provide=20
larger cardinals.=20

That is explicitly exemplified in the=20
document that has been available in
the University of Chicago Math
Library since 1965, and that has=20
been available in recent years as a
TAC Reprint. Using the definable
classes of sets smaller than any=20
given set, the postulate that there
are arbitrarily large such classes
closed under arbitrary definable
operations phi is proposed.  I am=20
not aware of any further studies
of that postulate. (This may be the=20
first time that a geometer has=20
shown persistent interest in=20
replacement)

Of course above I use the term "class"
in the intuitive sense of a natural
subset of every model of the theory
("meta-" in Mac lane's terminology),=20
that objective meaning corresponding
subjectively to a formula of the theory.
That is, not in the sense of a half-
hearted attempt to  represent classes
by elements V of the model.

(Less half-hearted is the proposal
that seems implicit in the 1963
reaction of Goedel & Bernays=20
themselves when they heard,
presumably from Kreisel, that
work was underway on a=20
categorical set theory. Namely try
a category of classes of classes etc
satisfying at least the intuitive=20
property of cartesian closure.)

The usual replacement scheme=20
does seem at first to yield only
cardinals smaller than given ones.=20
But in the hierarchical view, that=20
quotient set consists of elements=20
which themselves have elements,
thus the actual mathematical=20
content is that of a family of=20=20
sets, a concept whose=20
geometrical expression is that=20
of a fibration, hence Colin's=20
formulation of the axiom.
Indeed the formulation goes back
many years, but I don't have a reference.

Concerning an elementary self-embeddings
of the universe, it is in any case an
additional functor added to the=20
basic structure, and since the
basic structure of category is first-order,
a scheme could be considered to the
effect that such a functor commute
with quantifiers.
