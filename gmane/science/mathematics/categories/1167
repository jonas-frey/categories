Colin,

Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that every \tau-category is a 
category with inclusions.  Moreover, I recall a result by Freyd that every 
(sufficiently small? cartesian?) category is equivalent to a \tau-category. 
 The proof does not use choice.

In any event, see Categories, Allegories by Freyd and Scedrov for 
\tau-categories.  Hope this helps.
