The studentships advertised below may be of interest to readers of the
categories list:
note especially that John Power is available to supervise research in
category theory,
with particular application to computer science.

-------

The Department of Computer Science at the University of Bath is
currently recruiting PhD research students in the area of Mathematical
Foundations.  A number of fully-funded studentships are available to
cover fees and
an annual stipend, subject to eligibility.

The Mathematical Foundations group at Bath conducts research in:
* logic and semantics of programming languages (Laird, McCusker,
Power, Pym)
* category theory and proof theory (Guglielmi, Power, Pym)
* computer algebra, computational geometry, cryptography, networks
and security  (Bradford, Davenport, Richardson, Vorobjov)
* logic programming, answer-set programming, artificial
intelligence and multi-agent systems (De Vos, Nickles, Padget)

A complete list of staff members in Mathematical Foundations and their
research interests can be found at
http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/department/mathematical-foundations/staff-research-interests.html

Informal enquiries may be made to any member of
staff in the department.  An application form may be downloaded from
http://www.bath.ac.uk/prospectus/postgrad/apply/

To be considered for a funded place, applications should normally be
received by April 2nd 2009.
