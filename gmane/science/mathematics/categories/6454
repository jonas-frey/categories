Dear Finn,

The sheaves for a topology can be defined as those presheaves which send =
certain
diagrams to limits. The diagrams in question are determined by the =
topology.=20

Similarly, the Elienberg-Moore algebras can be seen as the presheaves on =
the Kleisli=20
category which send certain diagrams to limits. The limits in question, =
however, are not
(usually) those determined by a topology, thus Street and Walters speak =
of a generalized
topology.=20

Regards,

Steve Lack.
