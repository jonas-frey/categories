Following on from Fred Linton's comment, an easy example is groupoids. For a
connected groupoid G, any vertex (object) group
G(x)= G(x,x) is skeletal in G. See my book:
www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/topgpds.html
(since I do all the publicity, I have to take every opportunity....!)
For many mathematicians, this meant that `groupoids reduced to groups'.  But
this reduction involves choices, and so cannot be made natural, which takes
us back to the first paper on categories by E-M!

Heller commented to me in the 1980s that on this reductionist basis, vector
spaces reduce to a cardinality. But, as he said,  the classification of
vector spaces with n endomorphisms is interesting for n=1, hard for n=2, and
unknown for n=3.

I have not seen a classification of groupoids with one endomorphism!
