My first contact with Grothendieck was in the late sixties through a =
letter to him from a naive grad student (me) asking him if I could come =
to France and study with his group in Paris as I expected a Canadian =
post doc which would take me there. In reply, I received a very nice =
letter from him telling me that I should go to Strasbourg and study with =
a new student of his, J.-L.Verdier. That the same sort of thing had sent =
him to Nancy rather than Paris when he was young and he had never =
regretted it. This I did and learned a hell of a lot.

I  got to know him personally quite well after that in Buffalo when he =
came here  for two summers in 1970-71 thanks to NSF and the department =
and (his view) that the IHES was funded by the french military. It was a =
way that he could fund Survivre.=20

Among others, he gave a beautiful series of advanced lectures on the =
Grothendieck-Teichmuller group  as well as elementary lectures on sheaf =
theory. Some of these were recorded and were redone more recently by =
Bill Lawvere . Perhaps now these should become available=E2=80=A6.
