Dear David

Thanks for clarifying the notion of Frobenius functor.

In the chapter 4 of the latest version of their book

http://www.math.tamu.edu/~maguiar/a.pdf

Aguiar and Mahajan introduce a notion of P-monoidal functor=20
for P is an operad.

If P is the Ass operad (whose models are monoids).
then a P-monoidal functor is a lax monoidal functor,
and if P is the Com operad (whose models are commutative monoids),
then a  P-monoidal functor is a symmetric lax monoidal functor.
Their examples include a notion of Lie-monoidal functor (in the enriched =
case).
Dually, they introduce a notion of P-comonoidal functor
with the examples of colax (=3Doplax) monoidal functors
and of symmetric oplax monoidal functors.

But a bilax monoidal functor is not a P-monoidal functor
in the sense of Aguiar and Mahajan because the notion of bialgebra
is defined by a PROP, not by an operad. Similarly a Frobenius monoidal =
functor
is not a P-monoidal functor because the notion of Frobenius algebra
is defined by a PROP, not by an operad.


The notion of P-monoidal functor for P a PROP=20
is not defined in their book.

Any idea?


Best regards,
Andr=E9

John Baez could not recall whether bilax and Frobenius monoidal functors =
=3D
are the same.

The answer is no, in the usage I'd been familiar with,  bilax meant =3D
simply equipped with both lax and oplax structures, while a Frobenius =
=3D
monoidal functor satisfies  additional coherence relation which =3D
generalize the relations between the multiplication and comultiplication =
=3D
in a Frobenius algebra.

A bilax monoidal functor from the one-object monoidal category to VECT =
=3D
would be a vector-space with both an algebra and a coalgebra structure =
=3D
on it (no coherence relations relating them), while a Frobenius monoidal =
=3D
functor would be a Frobenius algebra. =3D20

Aguiar (with good reason), on the other hand, reserves bilax for =3D
functors equipped with coherence relations generalizing the relations =
=3D
between the operations and cooperations in a bialgebra, so that a bilax =
=3D
functor from the one-object monoidal category to VECT would be a =3D
bialgebra.  This notion, however, only makes sense in the presence of =
=3D
braidings on the source and target.

I think Aguiar's usage should prevail, though we also need a name for =
=3D
functors between general monoidal categories which are simultaneously =
=3D
lax and oplax.

Best Thoughts,
David Yetter=3D
