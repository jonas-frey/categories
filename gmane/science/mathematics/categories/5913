Dear Ronnie and Peter=2C

=20

    In the applications of algebraic topology to topology=2C
where do the =91basepoints=92=20
originate? From my (regrettably too few) contacts with algebraic
topologists I gleaned the following:

=20

1.   =20
(S. Eilenberg) The base point is the residue of
a collapsed subspace=2C which results=2C for example=2C in constructing a m=
odel of
the 2-sphere by collapsing the boundary of a 2-ball.=20

=20

2.   =20
(B. Eckmann)  The pairs=2C space/subspace (whose homology is often studied)=
  can be usefully generalized
to arbitrary maps as objects=2C not just inclusion maps.

=20

3.   =20
(R. Swan)  A construction is usually not functorial if one of its steps
involves complementation of subobjects=3B but collapsing subobjects retains
nearly the same information=2C yet is functorial.

=20

4.   =20
(M. Artin and G. Wraith)  An important refinement of the morphism
category of 2. above involves =91gluing=92 along a left-exact functor betwe=
en
two categories=2C a special =91comma=92 category construction that in fact =
always
yields a topos if the original categories are toposes. For example=2C the i=
nverse
image functor   i  of a grounding of one topos over
another yields in this way a topos whose objects are maps  i(S) =E0 E.

=20

5.   =20
(P. Freyd) Under the name of sconing the
geometrical construction of 4. is very useful in case the objects S of the =
base
topos deserve to be called =91discrete=92. (Ronnie B. points out that this =
sort of category is the
natural domain of the fundamental groupoid.)

=20

6.   =20
Suppose a topos (of spaces) is locally connected
over another one (of discrete spaces). That means that the inverse image fu=
nctor i (itself the left adjoint of a
points functor) has its own further left adjoint  p  counting
connected components.  Then the
constructions of 4.=2C 5.=2C yield a result which is again locally connecte=
d=3B the
extended  p  assigns to any  A=E0
E the pushout E/A with A=E0 i p A. In the spirit of 3. I think of E/A as th=
e exterior of A. This
construction is clearly a left adjoint and hence co-continuous in contrast =
to
the construction which merely collapses any A to a point (with which it agr=
ees
in case A has exactly one component).

  Here is a proposed application of the construction of
4.=2C 5=2C 6.=2C to geometric analysis=2C serving e.g. as a refutation to t=
he supposed
ubiquity of rings without unit:

=20

The easy notion of support for
covariant quantities like measures is concerned with domain of dependence: =
An
element of M(E) might come from an element of M(A) via A =E0 E and hence be
supported on A. Also for contravariant quantities we need not make an abusi=
ve
use of the properties of minus and zero. A function on X =91of compact supp=
ort=92 may be interpreted as one that does
not depend on the large part L=20
which is remote from some small part K of interest=3B here K union L =3D X.
The complements of such  K  are to be inoperative in the variation
of such particular functions. But even the line has two ends so that consta=
ncy
on the components of L is a more functorial condition on functions. If the
codomain space R has certain algebraic structure=2C then R(X=2CL) =3D R^(X/=
L)=2C the
exponential space of functions on the indicated pushout enjoys all the same
algebraic structure=2C as does the colimit over all large remote L in X (th=
ese
being filtered). Of course=2C this construction R(X/infinity) is functorial=
  only
for proper maps X =E0
Y=2C i.e. those whose inverse image preserves the large remoteness. The cov=
ariant
dependency of the dual space Hom (R (X/infinity)=2C R) of functionals is li=
kewise
only along proper maps=2C in contrast to that of the smaller space M(X)=3DH=
om(R^X=2CR)
of functionals that have to integrate all functions of the category.
Best wishes=2CBill
