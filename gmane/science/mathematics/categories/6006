Sorry, the previous posting was nonsense -- a bisemilattice is the
same thing as a semilattice, by the Eckmann-Hilton argument.
However, if you leave out the zero, and consider the "set of
nonempty subsets" monad, this time on the category of sets of
cardinality 2^n - 1 for some n, you do get a counterexample.
