Dear Bas,

I'm fairly sure this is in Joyal and Tierney (though I haven't got it
in front of me). I admit I couldn't find it in a quick look through
the Elephant. If I'm wrong about Joyal and Tierney then perhaps it's
in "Topos Theory".

If f: E -> F is a localic geometric morphism, then it is described by
f_*(Omega_E), an internal frame in F. E is the category of internal
sheaves in F for this frame. (More generally, f_*(Omega_E) is used in
constructing the hyperconnected-localic factorization of f.)

In the case where F is Sets and E is localic, then f_*(X) is the set
of global elements of any object X of E. Hence the external frame is
the set of global elements of the subobject classifier of E.

Regards,

Steve.
