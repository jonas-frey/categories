Dear Andre,

Yes, I entirely agree with that. In our discussion I did not promote
Jacob Lurie's use of "oo-category" for "quasi-category", What I did
and do promote is to use

  * "oo-groupoid" and "(oo,0)-category" as the term for the abstract
concept which is equivalently realized by Kan complexes, simplicial
groupoids, topological spaces, etc. and has special strict models by
strict omega-groupoids, oo-fold groupoids etc.

  * "(oo,1)-category" as the term for the abstract concept which is
equivalently realized by quasi-categories, Kan-complex enriched
categories, complete Segal spaces, Segal categories, categories with
weak equivalences, (oo,1)-theta spaces, etc.

  * "(oo,n)-category" as the term for the abstract concept which is
equivalently realized by n-fold complete Segal spaces, (oo,n)-Theta
spaces etc.

Best,
Urs
