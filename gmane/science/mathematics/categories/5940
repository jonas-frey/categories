As for what is meant, these links seem to be relevant:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventio#Topoi
http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_h.html#humility_topos_anchor
I don't think that "humility topos" should be in quotation marks,
although it looks like "topos" is supposed to be italicised
(as a foreign word, always with the foregin plural "topoi").

If anybody knows an eager literary theorist,
see if you can get a response to the question
"What classifies parts in the humility topos?"
(using the term "part" instead of "subobject" to make it more accessible).

The best answer that I could get from the Internet
is the 1601 Elizabethan Poor Law.
But I fear that this is in too restricted a context
(the subobject classifier of some slice of the humility topos).
