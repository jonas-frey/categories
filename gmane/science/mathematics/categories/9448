Dear Category Theorists,

We have an assistant professorship of mathematics open at the University of
Michigan-Dearborn.

https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/jobs/11099

The position is open to all areas of mathematics, including higher category
theory, algebraic topology, and mathematical music theory. The deadline is
December 8th, 2017. Research is part of this job, as are teaching and
service.

Dearborn is 30 miles east of Ann Arbor, well within commuting distance. The
wider region around Dearborn is home to much topology activity, for
instance: Ann Arbor and Wayne State are nearby, and Michigan State
University is a little further away.

We also have a statistics position open, with the earlier deadline of
November 30, 2017. People with expertise to teach upper level statistics
courses can also apply.

https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/jobs/10721

I would be happy to answer any questions potential applicants may have.

very best regards,
Tom Fiore
