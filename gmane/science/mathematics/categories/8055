In the 1981 Spring big math meeting in England -- held that year in
Oxford -- I walked with Dana to his home for dinner. Waiting there for
Dana was a guy from Springer with a copy of Peter's paper. Dana told him
that Peter had, of course, already given him a copy and, no, he had no
objections whatever; and didn't he want a drink anyway?

Best thoughts,
    Peter
