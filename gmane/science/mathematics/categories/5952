Yes, this is Grothendieck's stated intention, in the article "Topos"
written with Verdier in SGA 4 (p. 301).

But at the same time he and his friends knew well that topo, with
plural topos, is ordinary French for a little speech, and is common
slang for a school essay.  This comes from the long-time use of
"topos" as a term in rhetoric taken from Aristotle.

I have not found older uses of the specific term "humility topos," but
"topos" in this rhetorical sense is not postmodern.  It is one of the
oldest scholarly terms.
