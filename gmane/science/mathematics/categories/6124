Dear Steve, I was already aware that my statement "only one possible
meaning"? was much too general and I myself speculated (at the time of posting
the msage) about many possible exceptions when literally interpreting my
statement. But I decided to leave it like that. Luckily it was understood as I
meant (private msages).

I clarify to you and to those that may rise similar exceptions:

The Tohoku paper is just plain old classical mathematics (*), and nothing of
the sort of your example is to be found there.

I imagine on the other hand that in your papers you do not let the reader stay
   in the doubt about the meaning of these two possible meanings.


(*) where you can of course point out if some reasoning is constructively
valid (an exceptional example of this is the chapter on field extensions in
the second edition of the classical Van der Waerden book).

e.d.
