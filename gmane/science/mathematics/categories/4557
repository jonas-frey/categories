The chosen example is not too convincing,=20
since the notions involved are not typically categorical.
Complicated sentences like this can be found in every fields.
They are often the mark of a poor paper.

My guess is that the disdain for categories has a mixed origin.
Like logic, category theory has a taste for generalities.
But most mathematicians are specialised and they find
it hard to believe that important progresses can be made in their fields
from the outside, as the result of general insights.
But we all know that the division of mathematics into fields=20
is justified more by sociology than by science.=20
Category theory is a powerful tool for crossing=20
the boundaries between the fields.
The unity of mathematics is growing stronger every day.

Walter,

I beg to differ only with

In my experience, skepticism towards category theory is often rooted in
the fear of the "illegitimately large" size, till today.

In my experience, disdain for cat theory is due to papers with a very
high density of unfamiliar names
reminiscent of the minutia of PST and the (in) famous comment (by some
one) about something like:
hereditary hemi-demi-semigroups with chain condition
