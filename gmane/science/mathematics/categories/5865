Yes, we do meet isomorphisms of categories; my favourite algebraic
example is the isomorphism between (Boolean algebras) and (Boolean
rings), and another good one is the isomorphism between (finite
T_0-spaces) and (finite partial orders). But there's a sense in which
these isomorphisms are "accidental", arising from the fact that both
categories are based on the same category of sets, and in practice
(so far as I know) one never makes use of the fact that they are
isomorphisms rather than mere equivalences.

An even better example occurs in realizability. Some years ago on this
list I queried the need for the condition "Sxy is defined for all x
and y" in the definition of a partial combinatory algebra, and John
Longley came up with a beautiful proof that, given a "weak pca" A
which fails to satisfy this condition, there is a pca A' which does
satisfy it, such that the category of A-valued assemblies is *identical*
(not just equivalent, or even isomorphic) to the category of A'-valued
assemblies. (Details can be found in Jaap van Oosten's book.) The
accident arises in this case from the fact that A' happens to have the
same underlying set as A. But, once again, I don't know of any use for
the fact that the correspondence between the categories of assemblies is
anything more than an equivalence.
