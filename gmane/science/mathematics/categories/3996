Fowler, in his <i>Modern English Usage</i>, has this to say
under the heading <b>Role, r&ocirc;le</b>:

"Though the word is etymologically the same as <i>roll</i>, =

meaning the roll of MS. that contained an actor's part,
the differentiation is too useful to be sacrificed by
spelling always <i>roll</i>. But, there being no other
word <i>role</i> from which it has to be kept distinct,
both the italics and the accent might well be abandoned.
As to the sanctity of the French form, see MORALE."

And, under <b>Morale</b>, Fowler begins:

"Is a combination of pandantry and Gallicism to bully us
into ... ? ... The right course is to ... abstain from the =

French ... , of which we have no need."

Fowler would call it another result of "pedantry with French words."
