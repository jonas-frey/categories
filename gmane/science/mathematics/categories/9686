Hi Paul,

I think this is related to the [augmented] simplex category Delta.
This category has as objects [-1], [0], [1], ..., where [n] = {0,1,...,n},
and non-decreasing maps as morphisms. In this context, the maps
that you call "discard" and "copy" are referred to as "face maps"
and "degeneracy maps", and it's a standard lemma that face and
degeneracy maps generate Delta (the relevant equations are known
as the "simplicial identities").
The difference to your category in (1) is that you also want "swap".
I think you can write every function k -> m in your category (1) as
a bijection k -> k followed by a non-decreasing map k -> m, thus
your first statement should follow from the combination of the
statements for Delta and your (3).

Similarly to Delta, one has Delta_+, same objects as Delta but with
morphisms only the strictly increasing (= non-decreasing and
injective) maps; and it's again a standard lemma that these morphisms
are generated by the face maps.

  From this, you also get normal forms for the decomposition of functions;
what you get is that any function f: k -> m can be written as a
composition of a couple of swaps, then discards, then copies:

f = copy_i1 . ... . copy_in . discard_j1 . ... . discard_jp . swap_k1
... . swap_kq
