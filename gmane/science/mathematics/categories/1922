The Technical University of Denmark is happy to announce a
number of associate professorships (tenured) and assistant
professorships (untenured)

      http://www.imm.dtu.dk/cst/jobs.htm

covering data security, algorithmics, distributed systems,
software engineering, embedded systems etc.

The Technical University of Denmark was created in 1829 by
the discoverer of electromagnetism, H.C.Oersted, and became
the first private Danish University in 2001, thanks to a
donation by the Danish Government, in order to increase its
impact on research and teaching in engineering and science.

The Department of Informatics & Mathematical Modelling has
been given the mission to strengthen Computer Science and
Technology and will be announcing a substantial number of
positions within selected areas in the coming years.
