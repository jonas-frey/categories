Dear Paul,

I don't know if this category has been studied, but it looks like you
can also describe it as follows. Take the category Inj x Set. On
here there is a monad defined by T(A,B) = (A,A+B). The Kleisli category
of this monad appears to be SWL. That presentation seems to make it look
dual to Dialectica-type stuff.

Yes:
Dosen, Petric, "Syntax for split preorders", Annals of Pure and
Applied Logic 164 (2013) 443???481

I think Danos and Regnier might also talk about related things
somewhere, but I can't exactly tell you where (or if I am remembering
correctly).
