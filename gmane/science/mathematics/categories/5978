Dear Vaughan,

The problem with these representations (Nachbin, Priestley, ...) is that
they are not completely functorial. The natural morphisms (order-preservi=
ng
continuous maps) between the Nachbin or Priestley spaces correspond not t=
o
arbitrary continuous maps between the non-Hausdorff spaces, but to the
perfect ones.

Scott's insight was that computability implied a form of continuity, henc=
e
the role of the Scott topology in domains. If you restrict to perfect map=
s
then you lose some computable maps.

To put it rudely, the order (and the fact that continuity implies
monotonicity and preservation of directed joins) is already naturally
present in topological spaces, and the _un_natural thing to do is (1)
deliberately exclude it, then (2) put it back artificially, and (3) ignor=
e
the fact that you don't quite get the same thing.

The question of whether one likes the traditional notion of topological
space is really focusing on the wrong things - the objects instead of the
morphisms. (Actually, the traditional notion is not that attractive.) The
big question is how one explains continuity, and topological spaces were
set up to give an abstract definition of it. Scott's insights have
elucidated continuity for us, and at the same time validated the
non-Hausdorff notion of topological space (as I tried to explain in my
book).

And let me take this much further: Grothendieck's insights into continuit=
y
have shown that topological spaces don't go far enough. For example, he
showed that it is good to extend one's ideas of continuity so that a
continuous map to the "space of sets" (which doesn't exist as a topologic=
al
space) is a sheaf, and a continuous map from that space is a functor
preserving filtered colimits. His technique for topologization - specify
the category of sheaves - goes far beyond Hausdorff spaces and brings in
specialization orders that are not only non-discrete but even not orders
(they are the morphism structures in categories of points). Again, the
functoriality and preservation of filtered colimits is a natural and
intrinsic part of this.

(And we also know that when we follow Grothendieck's relativization
programme along these lines then we end up using point-free spaces rather
than the ordinary point-set spaces.)

To conclude, I don't believe that struggles to keep topology Hausdorff ar=
e
compatible with the deep insights of Scott, Grothendieck and others who
have given us important new clues to the nature of continuity.

Best wishes,

Steve.
