Some of this is now superseded by Richard's remarks, but I'll repost
nonetheless, since it offers a slightly different perspective...


The functor category is indeed symmetric monoidal. In fact, its really
only the monoidal structure on C that plays a role (by analogy to your
pointwise multiplication example, where you only need structure on the
codomain).

To ensure the functor is monoidal, the symmetry from C comes in to play:

(F @ G)(X @ Y) := F(X @ Y) @ G(X @ Y)
~= FX @ FY @ GX @ GY
~= FX @ GX @ FY @ GY
~= (F@ G)(X) @ (F @ G)(Y)

Probably more interesting is that, since the base category is
cartesian, so too is the functor category. Each object is endowed with
natural "copy" and "delete" maps, which are again natural in [T,C].
This might seem surprising, but being a monoidal natural
transformation is actually pretty restrictive when it comes to PROPs.
E.g. for frobenius algebras, it forces the map to be iso.
