Dear Colleagues,
   This is an invitation to attend the 2008 Clifford Lectures, which
will be held at Tulane from March 12 through March 15, 2008. The
Clifford Lectures are annual series of lectures hosted by the Tulane
Math Department in honoring of A. H. Clifford, noted algebraist, who
was a long time member of the department. This year's Clifford
Lecturer is Samson Abramsky, and the topic of his lectures is,
"Information flow in physics, geometry, logic and computation". Samson
will deliver five lectures on this topic during the course of the
series. In addition, thirteen researchers are also giving one-hour
lectures on this topic as part of the series. You can find details
about the speakers, the titles and abstracts of their talks, the
program and registration information at the page http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mwm/clifford
   Best regards,
   Mike Mislove
