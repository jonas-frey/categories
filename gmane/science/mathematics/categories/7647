Dear Jonathan,

I think you misread Mac Lane. If the 2-category is Cat , suppose =
functors f: A --> B  and u: B --> A are such that fu and uf are =
isomorphic to id(A) and id(B) by isomorphisms  eta: id(A) -->uf  and  =
epsilon: fu --> id(B).  He does not say that one can modify eta and =
epsilon can be to satisfy the the triangle identities.=20
What he says is: You can keep f and modify u, eta and epsilon to get a =
functor u': B ---> A and isomorphisms  eta': id(A) ---> u'f  and =
epsilon': fu' ---> id(B) satisfying the triangle identities.

Under this form the result is true for any 2- Category  C.
Sketch of proof: Suppose f: A --> B  and u: B ---> A are 1-cells  and =
eta and epsilon are isomorphism 2-cells. Then for each object  X of C, =
f,u,eta and epsilon define an equivalence between the categories  C(X,A) =
and C(X,B). Take X=3DB, then f defines an equivalence C(B,f): C(B,A) --> =
C(B,B). By Mac Lane's result we can find an adjoint to C(B,f), which is =
en equivalence,  U: C(B,B) ---> C(B,A).
Take u' =3D U(id(B)): B --->A . By a tedious but straightforward =
computation one verifies that the pair  (f, u') is an adjoint =
equivalence.=20

Bien amicalement,

Jean

> This is a standard fact, proved for instance in details in "Categories =
for the Working Mathematician" (Chapter 4, Section 4, Theorem 1 in the =
second edition), that a functor is an equivalence of categories if and =
only if it is part of an adjoint equivalence. I would like to use the =
fact that this is true in an arbitrary 2-category, i.e. that given an =
equivalence in a 2-category the invertible 2-cells can be required to =
satisfy the triangle identities. Is there a standard reference for this =
fact? Well-known books such as classical introductions to category =
theory are particularly welcome.=20
