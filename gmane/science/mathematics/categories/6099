Right.

I think you're right - they're subtler, and I haven't seen anyone else using
them.  I never proved any *theorems* about them.   But I used them
extensively in my course on "Classical versus quantum computation", starting
here:

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2006/index.html#computation

I wanted to explain how beta-reduction in the lambda calculus is like
"straightening a zig-zag".

There's a quick summary of this material in that "Rosetta Stone" paper with
Mike Stay, mentioned earlier:

Oh, okay.  Yeah, I was sort of disappointed that Micah credited me for
string diagrams in the autonomous case, where I didn't invent them, instead
of the closed case, where maybe I did.

Best,
