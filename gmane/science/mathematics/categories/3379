One aspect of the categorisation of "equation"  is the approach of
Banaschewski and Herrlich.  This replaces an equation as a pair (s,t)
of terms that belong to some free algebra F by the least quotient
(coequaliser)

e: F -->> F/E

identifying s and t.

An algebra A satisfies equation (s,t) precisely when every
homomorphism   F --> A lifts across e to a homomorphism   F/E --> A.

Thus the notion of an equation becomes that of a regular epi e with
free domain, and an object satisfies such an e when it is injective
for e.

To obtain a notion intrinsic to a given category, the free domains
were replaced by domains that are regular-projective, i.e. projective
for all regular epis, this being a property enjoyed by free algebras
in categories of universal algebras.

The approach has been dualised in the coalgebra literature, with a
"coequation" being defined as a regular mono with regular-injective
codomain, and a "covariety" as the class of coalgebras that are
projective for some given class of coequations.

Some (not all) relevant references are below.
