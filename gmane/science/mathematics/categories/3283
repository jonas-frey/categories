Peter Freyd writes on Pontrjagin duality. I would like to mention the
generalisation given in

 (with P.J. HIGGINS and S.A. MORRIS), ``Countable products of lines  and
circles: their closed subgroups, quotients and duality properties'',  {\em
Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.} 78 (1975) 19-32.

One point made is that a duality is not necessarily inherited by closed
subgroups and Hausdorff quotients. If it is, it is called a strong duality.
Then strong duality is inherited by closed subgroups and Hausdorff
quotients!

I have taught the classification of closed subgroups of R^n in an analysis
course. It is a nice result, and the sums you can set use duality in a nice
way - treatment borrowed from Bourbaki.
