Subject: New Editorial Board of the "Cahiers"
Date: Mon, 15 Dec 2014 21:23:39 +0100
To: categories@mta.ca

Dear Colleagues,

It is a pleasure to announce that the Editorial Board of the "Cahiers de 
Topologie et Geometrie Differentielle Categoriques" will be enlarged and 
modified as follows, starting from January 2015:

Chief Editors: Ehresmann Andree, Gran Marino, Guitart Rene

Editors: Adamek Jiri, Berger Clemens, Bunge Marta, Clementino Maria 
Manuel, Janelidze Zurab, Johnstone Peter, Kock Anders, Lack Stephen, 
Mantovani Sandra, Porter Tim, Pradines Jean, Riehl Emily, Street Ross.

The "Cahiers" were created in 1957 under the initial title "Seminaire 
Ehresmann. Topologie et Geometrie Differentielle", published in the series 
of the "Seminaires de l'Institut Henri Poincare". Starting from Volume II, 
they appeared as an independent publication, the title becoming "Cahiers 
de Topologie et Geometrie Differentielle" in 1966. In 1984 the present 
name "Cahiers de Topologie et Geometrie Differentielle Categoriques" was 
chosen, underlying the continuity with the origin of the journal, and also 
the natural change consisting in placing category theory at the centre of 
the journal. The "Cahiers" is a journal which, since its foundation, is 
under the only responsibility of its Chief-Editor(s). Since 1975, this 
journal has only lived thanks to its subscriptions, without any external 
subvention or material help.

The enlargement of the Editorial Board aims at including a new generation 
of mathematicians and opening the journal to some new research areas where 
category theory is developing and is being applied. The main research 
subject of the journal remains pure category theory, together with its 
applications in topology, differential geometry, algebraic geometry, 
universal algebra, homological algebra, and algebraic topology.

Papers submitted for publication should be sent to one of the editors as a 
pdf file, with a copy to Andree Ehresmann (ehres@u-picardie.fr).

More information on the "Cahiers" can be found on the site

http://ehres.pagesperso-orange.fr/Cahiers/Ctgdc.htm

Correspondence concerning subscriptions and backsets is to be sent to 
Andree Ehresmann by e-mail: ehres@u-picardie.fr

With our best wishes,

Andree Ehresmann, Marino Gran, Rene Guitart
