Dear fellow-categorists,

On behalf of the international CT Advisory Committee, I am delighted
to announce that Maria Manuel Clementino has agreed to join the
Committee with immediate effect. The current membership of the
Committee, in alphabetical order, is thus as follows:

Maria Manuel Clementino <mmc@mat.uc.pt>
Peter Johnstone <ptj@dpmms.cam.ac.uk> (Secretary)
Bill Lawvere <wlawvere@buffalo.edu> (Chair)
Ross Street <street@math.mq.edu.au>
Walter Tholen <tholen@pascal.math.yorku.ca>
Myles Tierney <tierney@math.uqam.ca>
Richard Wood <rjwood@mathstat.dal.ca>

It might be appropriate at this point to remind people of the
Committee's function. It has no official status, and no executive
authority: its sole function is to offer advice, and the benefit
of our collective experience, to those who may
be thinking of organizing international conferences in Category
Theory, with the aim of ensuring that such conferences should take
place on a reasonably regular basis. Anyone who might be thinking
of organizing such a meeting is welcome to contact any member of
the Committee -- but particularly the undersigned -- at any time.

Peter Johnstone
