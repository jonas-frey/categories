It might be fair to remember that "Topoi" is the title of 6th book or =
Aristotle's Organon. "On Categories" is the title of the 1st book of =
Organon.=20

Both concepts were very actively used by scolastic philosophers. Maybe =
we are their heirs of some sort ;)

It would be interesting to know about the motivations of people who =
introduced these terms into mathematics. I think that MacLane said at =
one point that there was a terminological link through Rudolf Carnap, =
thus through neokantians. The notion of categories plays a prominent =
role in Kant's first Critique. But it is even more interesting if the =
term topos was introduced with an intentional reference to *dialectics*, =
which is what that part of Organon is about.
