Although Grothendieck did it only for directed sets and in abelian groups,
once he had done that the extension to sets was obvious and to filtered
categories not much more.  Five years later, when I sat in on Sammy's
course called homological algebra, but really category theory, he had the
full limit notion and I think must have talked about filtered index
categories (although I cannot quite remember it).
