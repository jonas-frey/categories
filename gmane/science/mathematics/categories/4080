[Note from moderator: I agree with Dusko's remarks below. After 48 hours
no further items will be posted in this thread. Moderate language will be
used in any contributions posted during that time.]

am i the only one who is not enjoying these arguments on CATEGORIES any
more? i started worrying:

** is there something special in category theory that attracts all these
** argumentative people? is it that being argumentative somehow helps you
** with math, and then arguing with the symbols on a piece of paper and on
** the blackboards then somehow overflows into your social life?...

and then i remembered that sometime in the early 90s, when the mailing
lists started spreading, there were such flame wars on every mailing list.
and they went on deep into the mid 90es. so i thought, maybe the category
theorists are not more argumentative than other people. maybe it's just
that some of them started using email a bit later, so they are
discovering the medium of flame war just now. so i waved my hand.

but now great jean benabou brought my little name into his argument,
together with claudio hermida. i am not sure what he means, but it sounds
like claudio and i are the examples of unreliable sources.

well, honestly, jean, i really don't have the remotest idea what i have
done to deserve the unhonorable mention. not having worked in anything
related to this area for more than 10 years, and not having done much
worth mentioning before that, AND not really depending on this community
either for my job or for my reputation, i am simply just surprised...

even after 10 min of scouring my memory, the only *remote* possibility
that occurs to me is that i gave a talk in oberwolfach, cca 1994,
describing the preservation conditions necessary and sufficient for
descent, and effective descent ((monadicity is sufficient, but not
necessary)). after my talk, or maybe in the middle, jean benabou stood up
and said: "Mathematics Should Be Beautiful." i started mumbling that i
was sorry if mine was so ugly ((was it my hand drawn diagrams on the
slides?)), but that some people would say that mathematics should first
of all be true... by which point we were both talking --- and max kelly
hushed us both down. (we miss you, max!)

i really really respect jean benabou's work. i also respect paul taylor's
work. i have learned a great deal from both of them. but i really don't
like how they argue their cases on this mailing list. (and if i am alone
in that, then maybe i dont even belong here.)

i agree that mathematics should be beautiful. short of that, since the
truth doesn't always obey everyone's taste, math should at least be
elegant, or decent.

but if we are able to produce beautiful, or elegant, or at least decent
mathematical arguments --- why is it that we generate such unpleasant
nonmathematical arguments? can we please please stop?

all the best,
-- dusko
