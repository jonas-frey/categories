Dear David,

Thank you for your very kind offer. There are, at least, two reasons =20
for which I'll have to think about it before I give an answer.

1- You say, I quote you:
"the input is no harder than writing in (La)TeX."
This seems to be very simple for you, but considering my very limited =20=

ability with computers (and this is an understatement) it will =20
probably be almost impossible for me. For example I cannot type (La)=20
TeX. If I need to have a text typed in TeX, I have to ask to a friend =20=

to type it for me. This is one of the reasons why I publish very =20
little although I have many handwritten first drafts on various =20
subjects in Category Theory.
2- Even assuming the friend would help me, the nLab is a wiki system, =20=

thus anybody would be able to modify my texts. And I'm sure I =20
wouldn't like that. I'm not against discussion and I wouldn't object =20
if one or many persons wrote their own texts, even if they are very =20
critical of mine, provided they give mathematical arguments to =20
justify their objections.

You might suggest solutions to 1 and 2, in which case I'd gladly =20
accept your offer.

Thanks again, and best regards,

Jean
