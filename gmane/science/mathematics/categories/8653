Project Summary

Verifiable vote counting is one of the cornerstones of a trustworthy
electronic voting system. Correctness and trust can be achieved by
understanding voting protocols, specified textually in legislation, as
formal rules. Vote counting can then be cast as successive rule
application, where the sequence of rule application serves as an
independently verifiable certificate attesting to the correctness of
the count. The project offers a wide range of activities, ranging
from foundations, rule design, efficiency considerations to concrete
case studies. The project seeks to further investigate this idea and
apply it to real-world voting systems and mainly deals with the
following aspects:

- generation of provably correct vote counting functions from rules
- efficiency of rule-based vote counting and certificate checking
- formal proofs of meta-properties of voting protocols
- case studies with real-world voting protocol
- minimising the gap between formal rules and legal specification
