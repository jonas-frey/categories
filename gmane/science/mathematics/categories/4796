Carnegie Mellon Summer School in Logic and Formal Epistemology

In the summer of 2009, the Department of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon
University will hold a three-week summer school in logic and formal
epistemology for promising undergraduates in philosophy, mathematics,
computer science, linguistics, and other sciences.

The goals are to

   o introduce students to cross-disciplinary fields of research at an
     early stage in their career; and
   o forge lasting links between the various disciplines.

The summer school will be held from Monday, June 8 to Friday, June 26,
2009. There will be morning and afternoon lectures and daily problem
sessions, as well as planned outings and social events.

The summer school is free. That is, we will provide

   o full tuition, and
   o dormitory accommodations on the Carnegie Mellon campus.

So students need only pay round trip travel to Pittsburgh and living
expenses while there. There are no grades, and the courses do not
provide formal course credit.

Instructions for applying can be found on the summer school web page,

   http://www.phil.cmu.edu/summerschool

Materials must be received by the Philosophy Department by March 15,
2009.

This year's topics are:

   Categories and Structures
   Monday, June 8 to Friday, June 12
   Instructor: Steve Awodey

   Decisions and Games
   Monday, June 15 to Friday, June 19
   Instructor: Teddy Seidenfeld

   Logic and Formal Verification
   Monday, June 22 to Friday, June 26
   Instructor: Jeremy Avigad

The summer school is open to undergraduates, as well as to students
who will be completing their first year of graduate school. Applicants
need not be US citizens. There is a $20 nonrefundable application
fee.

Inquiries may be directed to Jeremy Avigad (avigad@cmu.edu).
