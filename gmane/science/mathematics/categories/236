Tim -

I have been in telephone contact with Eraldo Giuli. His and Anna Tozzi's
families are fine. They are currently staying with their families away
from the town of L'Aquila, in order to avoid the aftershocks. They do,
however, report considerable damage to some of their properties in L'Aquila.

Regards,
Walter.
