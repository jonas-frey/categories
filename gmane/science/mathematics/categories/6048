John Cartmell (who introduced contextual categories and generalized algebra=
ic theories as models of dependent types in his 1978 Oxford D.Phil thesis a=
nd a 1986 Ann. Pure App. Logic paper) worked on topics related to this thre=
ad some years ago. Another 1986 paper, 'Formalizing the Network and Hierarc=
hical Data Models --- an Application of Categorical Logic', CATEGORY THEORY=
  AND COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
LNCS, 1986, Volume 240/1986, 466-492, DOI: 10.1007/3-540-17162-2_138, can b=

'Abstract. We have noted that data modelling and conceptual modelling have =
content and performance as their concerns. For the different data models, t=
he Network and the Hierarchic, we have given logics involving the operation=
s which are physically supported according to the data model. The logics ar=
e sensitive to performance in a way that classical logic is not. We have no=
w suggested how we might formalise this. Network and Hierarchical databases=
  have the functional inverse or family as their primitive of organisation. =
To formalise the Network model we have given a general definition of networ=
k category which seems to generalise correctly the hierarchical logic of co=
ntextual categories.'

There is also relevant work on categories and logic programming.
