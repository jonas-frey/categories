Dear Michael,

In my paper "Sheaves and Prime Model Extensions", J. of Algebra 68 (1981)
79-96, there is a proof of the existence of the real closure of an ordered
field in any elementary topos, plus considerations about the failure of the
existence of the algebraic closure. The context is more general (model
theory in toposes), and there are other instances which I do not recall
offhand. Maybe that is not what you are asking? I thought that I would
mention it, just in case.

Best,
Marta
