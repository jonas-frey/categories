The translation of G's Tohoku paper is now available at
ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr/pdffiles/gk.pdf
I must note that a half year ago, G requested that no copying or
translation of his works should be made.  However, he has said that he
doesn't believe in copyright, so this was made as a personal request that
I am ignoring.  If you believe, as I do, that these works are the common
property of mankind, not to be suppressed, you will ignore G's request.
But if you take it seriously, then don't look at it and don't download it.

The translation was done by Marcia (my wife) and me.  She is a
professional translator.  I used the opportunity to modernize his language
to some extent.  We have doubtless introduced errors (as well as cleaning
up a lot of errors, both of G's and---mainly, I think---of the
typesetters.  Please let me know if you find any.  There will be places
where you disagree with the translation.  You can let me know, and we will
consider them seriously, but may not adopt them.  Reasonable people may
differ on their philosophy of translation.  So be it.

Michael
