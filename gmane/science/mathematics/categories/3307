A bit of confusion occured when I tried to post a corrected version of the
above (all due to myself), so here goes.

I retract the statement in ** ** above - what I meant was G/H with a badly
behaved topological/differentiable quotient (H normal in G) and I was after
examples not connected with gerbes/crossed modules but something more
`interesting' than group quotients.

Thanks,
