Yes, all this "discussion" is mainly misunderstanding, and I apologize
if I've contributed to it. It seems it was triggered by this piece:

So, the issue is closed. Still there is some point to mention, and I
again apologize if I'm peering into it too much. Our entire
mis-discussion is, perhaps, a result of two different attitudes. CT
favors and prefers to work in a presentation-free setting while
engineering applications are all about presentations; and this
mismatch may contribute to the disdain of CT from the practitioners'
side.  (Of course, this is not meant to anyhow diminish the elegance,
value and usefulness even for practical problems such concepts as
triple or classifying category :).
