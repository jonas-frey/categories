SPECIAL VOLUME OF THEORY AND APPLICATIONS OF CATEGORIES (TAC)
Proceedings, Category Theory and Computer Science CTCS'02

Guest Editors - Rick Blute(Ottawa) and Richard Wood (Dalhousie)

Second Call for Papers


http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/


This special volume of Theory and Applications of Categories is devoted to
the proceedings of the 2002 conference Category Theory and Computer
Science, held at the University of Ottawa. The purpose of the conference
series is the advancement of the foundations of computing using the tools
of category theory. Indeed, category theory provides one of the key tools
in the analysis of the interaction between logic and the theory of
computation. The extent to which category theory has influenced these
areas can be seen from the following list of topics, which are typical of
the interests of this conference:

-coalgebras and computing
-concurrent and distributed systems
-constructive mathematics
-declarative programming and term rewriting
-domain theory and topology
-foundations of computer security
-linear logic
-modal and temporal logics
-models of computation
-program logics, data refinement, and specification
-programming language semantics
-type theory

The list is by no means exhaustive. This special volume is devoted not
just to journal versions of the papers which appeared in the proceedings,
but is intended to showcase papers which emphasize any of the above
topics. Papers will be refereed to the usual high standards of TAC.

* Submission deadline: January 5th, 2004.
