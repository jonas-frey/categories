I would like to announce the following paper, which has been posted on
my www site <http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~rags>.  (The McGill ftp site is
currently not functionning, but as soon as it is restored, this paper
ought to appear on the Hypatia mirror site as well.)

The abstract follows.

Introduction to linear bicategories

by J.R.B. Cockett, J. Koslowski, R.A.G. Seely

Linear bicategories are a generalization of the notion of a bicategory,
in which the one horizontal composition is replaced by two (linked)
horizontal compositions. These compositions provide a semantic model for
the tensor and par of linear logic: in particular, as composition is
fundamentally noncommutative, they provides a suggestive source of
models for noncommutative linear logic.

In a linear bicategory, the logical notion of complementation becomes a
natural linear notion of adjunction. Just as ordinary adjoints are
related to (Kan) extensions, these linear adjoints are related to the
appropriate notion of linear extension.

There is also a stronger notion of complementation, which arises, for
example, in cyclic linear logic. This sort of complementation is
modelled by cyclic adjoints. This leads to the notion of a *-linear
bicategory and the coherence conditions which it must satisfy. Cyclic
adjoints also give rise to linear monads: these are, essentially, the
appropriate generalization (to the linear setting) of Frobenius
algebras.

A number of examples of linear bicategories arising from different
sources are described, and a number of constructions which result in
linear bicategories are indicated.

This paper is dedicated to Jim Lambek, as part of the celebration of his
75th birthday.
