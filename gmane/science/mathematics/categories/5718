This problem is solved in a recent paper of mine "On embedding categories
in groupoids" in Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc., vol. 145. Actually, the
problem was essentially solved by Mal'cev and (independently) by Jim Lambek=
,
who gave necessary and sufficient conditions for a semigroup to be
embeddable in a group; all one has to do is to observe that the same
conditions work in the situation when one has several objects.
