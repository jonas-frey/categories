                              for the 

    WORKSHOP ON COALGEBRAIC METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (CMCS'2000)




Scope

State-based dynamical systems as found throughout computing science are traditionally described as transition systems or certain kinds of
automata. During the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that such systems can be captured uniformly as so-called ``coalgebras'' (which
are the formal dual of algebras). Coalgebra is beginning to develop into a field of its own, with its own proof-methods (involving bisimulations and
invariants). This workshop will be devoted to both an introduction to basic coalgebraic notions and techniques, and also to some recent advances in
the theory of coalgebras. 

We are looking for participants and contributed talks to this informal workshop on both the theory and the use of coalgebras in computer science.
The workshop will consist of two days, preceding the ETAPS conference (25-26 March, 2000) at the Technical University of Berlin. More
information regarding submissions is given below. 

The scope of the meeting includes the following themes: 

 - the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical 
      approaches); 
 - coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming 
      languages, dynamic systems, etc.); 
 - coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming; 
 - coalgebras and data types; 
 - (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
      bisimulations or invariants); 
 - coalgebras and (hidden-sorted) algebras; 
 - coalgebraic specification and verification; 
 - coalgebras and (modal) logic 

Organization: Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen), Horst Reichel(Dresden), Jan Rutten (CWI, Amsterdam) and Larry Moss (Bloomington, IN). 

Program Committee: H. Peter Gumm (Marburg), Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen), Ugo Montanari (Pisa), Larry Moss (Bloomington, IN), Ataru T.
Nakagawa (Tokyo), John Power (Edinburgh), Horst Reichel (Dresden), Jan Rutten (CWI, Amsterdam). 

Submissions

The following dates are important for submission to the ENTCS volume. 

   -  3 January 2000: deadline for submissions. 
   -  11 February 2000: notification of acceptance. 
   -  3 March 2000: final version. 
   -  25-26 March 2000: workshop, where a printed version of the ENTCS 
      issue will be available for participants. 
   -  (25 March - 2 April, 2000: ETAPS conference). 

The ideal submission is not longer than 20 pages, and gives a clear exposition of the relevant ideas. It can be sent by email to: Horst Reichel, or by
ordinary mail to:
