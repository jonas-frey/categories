It might be amusing for people to see the full context as I replied to
Bodo: 


Serge Lang used it in his Addiison-Wesley  text: " Algebra" in the
first(?) 1965 edition. On page 105 after the chapter on Homology, the
following appears:


 "EXERCISES: Take any book on homological algebra, and prove all the
theorems without looking at the proofs given in that book. Homological
algebra was invented by Eilenberg-Mac Lane. General category theory
(i.e. the theory of arrow-theoretic results ) is generally known as
<italic>abstract nonsense</italic> ( the terminology is due to
Steenrod)."
