FOMI 2008 - 3rd Workshop on Formal Ontologies Meet Industry

June 5-6, 2008, Torino, Italy


		FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS


Conference web site: http://www.fomi2008.di.unito.it

This event is jointly organized by:
       - Laboratory for Applied Ontology, ISTC-CNR, Trento
       - University of Torino
       - University of Verona

CONFERENCE AIMS

FOMI is an international forum where academic researchers and
industrial practitioners meet to analyze and discuss issues related
to methods, theories, tools and applications based on formal
ontologies.

There is today wide agreement that knowledge modeling and the
semantic dimension of information plays an increasingly central
role in networked economy: semantic-based applications are relevant
in distributed systems such as networked organizations, organizational
networks, and in distributed knowledge management. These
knowledge models in industry aim to provide a framework for
information and knowledge sharing, reliable information exchange,
meaning negotiation and coordination between distinct organizations or
among members of the same organization.

New tools and applications have been and are being developed in diverse
application fields, ranging from business to medicine, from engineering
to finance, from law to electronics. All these systems have exploited
the theoretical results and the practical experience of previous work.
In all cases, it has been shown that formal ontologies play a
central role in describing in a common and understandable way
the logical and practical features of the application domain.

The success of the methodologies associated with knowledge modeling
and ontologies led to increased need of a comparison between different
approaches and results, with the aim of evaluating the interdependencies
between theories and methods of formal ontology and the activities,
processes, and needs of enterprise organizations.

The FOMI 08 Workshop aims to advance in this direction by bringing
together researchers and practitioners interested in ontology
application,
paying particular attention to the topics listed below.

CONFERENCE TOPICS

*problems in ontology application:*
  - practical issues in using ontologies in the enterprise
  - real cases of successful/unsuccessful use of ontology in business
  - from legacy systems to the new ontology-driven systems

*ontology and business:*
  - ontology and ontological methodologies in business;
  - adaptation of ontologies for companies and organizations;
  - ontology effectiveness and evaluation in business

*ontology and enterprise:*
  - ontology-driven enterprise modeling;
  - ontology development and change within organizations;
  - ontology-driven representation of products, services,
functionalities,
	 design, processes;

*ontology and enterprise knowledge:*
  - ontologies for the know-how;
  - ontologies for corporate knowledge;

*ontology in practice:*
  - ontologies for electronic catalogs, e-commerce, e-government;
  - ontologies for marketing;
  - ontologies for finance;
  - ontologies for engineering;
  - ontologies for medical sciences;

*ontology and linguistics:*
  - ontology-driven linguistic representation in organization knowledge;
  - linguistic problems in standards and in codification processes;
  - ontologies and multilingualism in business and organizations

PROGRAMME

The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations,
poster and demo presentations, and panels. Submitted papers will be
peer-reviewed and selected on the basis of technical quality,
relevance of the described experiences (depending on the type of
submission),
and clarity of the presentation for the workshop. In particular, we
insist
that papers should be written for a wide audience. Accepted papers will
be presented at the workshop, and published as proceedings.

Accepted papers will be electronically published on CD and distributed
to participants. Following the past edition, a selection of the best
papers
accepted at the workshop will be considered for publication in the
international journal "Applied Ontology"

SUBMISSIONS AND DATES

* Format
   - The maximal paper length is 10 pages, excluding title page and
bibliography.
   - Papers must be submitted in PDF format
   - Detailed instructions can be found in the conference site.

* Deadlines:
   - Paper Submission: January 7, 2008
   - Acceptance Notification: March 3, 2008
   - Camera Ready: March 31, 2008
