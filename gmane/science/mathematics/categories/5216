The Twenty-sixth Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of =20
Programming Semantics will take place on the campus of the University =20=

of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada UK from May 6 - 10, 2010. MFPS conferences =20=

are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic, and computer science =20=

that are related to models of computation, in general, and to the =20
semantics of programming languages, in particular. The series has =20
particularly stressed providing a forum where researchers in =20
mathematics and computer science can meet and exchange ideas about =20
problems of common interest. As the series also strives to maintain =20
breadth in its scope, the conference strongly encourages participation =20=

by researchers in neighboring areas.

TOPICS include, but are not limited to, the following: biocomputation; =20=

concurrent and distributed computation; constructive mathematics; =20
domain theory and categorical models; formal languages; formal =20
methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; logic; probabilistic =20
systems; process calculi; programming language theory; quantum =20
computation; security; topological models; type systems; type theory.

The INVITED SPEAKERS for MFPS XXVI are

Amal Ahmed, Indiana
Martin Escardo, Birmingham
Cedric Fournet, Microsoft, Paris
Pieter Hofstra, Ottawa
Jean Krivine, PPS, Paris 7
Keye Martin, NRL

In addition, there will be four SPECIAL SESSIONS:

- A Session on Logic and Category Theory will be held in conjunction =20
with Pieter Hofstra's plenary talk. The session is being organized by =20=

Rick Blute and Phil Scott (Ottawa).

- A Session on Domain Theory will be held in conjunction with Martin =20
Escardo's plenary talk. It is being organized by Dr. Escardo.

- A Session on Systems Biology will be held in conjunction with Jean =20
Krivine's plenary talk. The session is being organized by Dr. Krivine.

- A Session on Security will be held in conjunction with Cedric =20
Fournet's plenary address. It is being organized by Catherine Meadows =20=

(NRL).

In addition, there will be four TUTORIAL TALKS on Model Checking and =20
Verification. These are being organized by Prakash Panangaden =20
(McGill), and include talks by Amy Felty (Ottawa), Joel Ouaknine =20
(Oxford) and Jams Worrell (Oxford), as well as by Professor =20
Panangaden. The talks will be given during the course of the meeting.

The remainder of the program will consist of papers selected by the =20
