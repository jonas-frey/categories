This is really sad news. Aurelio was a unique person, merging mathematical
insight, humour and one, his very own, disenchanted sense of life. The
latter was a recurrent subject of debate between us every time we met, since
the first time at the State University of Milan in 1983, during a seminar in
logic. His remarks, in the form of criticism and suggestion on specific
topics of research, were always helpful to grasp the point of a problem,
seen from his own, deep, understanding of mathematics.

Best regards,
Aberto Peruzzi
