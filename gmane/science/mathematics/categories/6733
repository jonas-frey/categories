In the absence of AC=2C we need to specify which notions of"finite" we are =
using. Certainly K-S (=3D locally quotient of standard numeral) while impor=
tant is by no means the endof the story. We categorists do not seem to yet =
have a way of dealing  elegantly with the locally Noetherian=2C coherent=2C=
etcsheaves in terms of internal finiteness notions.
The SUBQUOTIENTS of standard numerals would surely be important. I recall t=
he existence of intuitionist literature on this=2C but it seemed to assume =
that subquots of subquots etc would be an infinite sequence. Of course in a=
  category with reasonable pullbacks and pushouts this relation is already t=
ransitive (indeed an important subcategory of spans).
  But the original question actually had to do with the observation that for =
any qualitative definition of finite set=2C there are probably as many as t=
here things in the ambient universe. We need an axiom of infinity to say th=
at there is a category object that represents that metacategory UP TO EQUIVA=
LENCE OF COURSE.=20
The uniqueness is only relative to the ambient universe . The Incompletenes=
s Theorem would seem to imply that there are an infinite number of non-eleme=
ntarily-equivalent ambient universesand hence of these little metacategorie=
s in particular.
We really should overcome the ritual belief that such things must be define=
d by iteration (as opposed to being partially investigated via iteration). A=
lready Peano misrepresented Grassmann's views on this.
Dedekind proposed that a set  A is finite if any idempotent whose fixed par=
t is isomorphic to all of A is itself an automorphism. This seems difficult=
to relate to operations such as product. However note that it is an element=
ary axiom to require that all objects of a given topos satisfy it. It would =
see to propagate to any finite (in the sense of Artin) topos over such. Do =
basictheorems=2C such as the essentialness  of all geometric morphisms=2C e=
xtend to this axiomatic setting ?
A different elementary axiom on a topos is the requirement that every objec=
t A is fixed by the monad obtained by composing 3^( ) with its adjoint from =
the related topos of left actions of 3^3.
Are these two theories equivalent ? Such a finitely-axiomatized T defines "=
the" category of finite sets as any one that represents up to equivalence t=
he submetacategory of the ambient universe consisting of all discrete catego=
ries that are finite in the stated sense.( But then of course there are many=
  models of T not equivalent to that)
I proposed the study of such an "Objective Number Theory" in Braga four yea=
rs ago at a European computer science meeting without much response. It is =
known since Craig-Vaught that Peano's arithmetic can be embedded in a finit=
ely axiomatizable theory=2Cbut it seems reasonable to try to find such an e=
xpansion with an objective content.If E is such a category=2C the Paris-Har=
rington theory seems to be about the topos E^Iwhere I is the arrow category=
=3B but don't the properties of that follow from those of E ?

PS Of course this ONT is not the same as (though related to) my ongoing=
  work with Schanuel and Menni.
