I am ready to take back my criticism and apologize, if the "longer senten=
ce"=20
is correct. But is it?

I am certainly not an expert in Bourbaki history, and, as far as I rememb=
er,=20
they say no word about morphisms in the historical part of "Theory of Set=
s"=20
and give no references on categories. But I think they "always" believed=20
that structures determine isomorphisms but not morphisms, and I don't thi=
nk=20
they changed their mind between 1951 and 1957.

When I say "they" I mean "those of them who made main decisions about the=
=20
Bourbaki tractate". Because I hope (!) that not all of them were happy th=
at=20
categories are not even defined in the tractate.

In my previous message I wrote "Removing Bourbaki's formalism..." but in=20
fact that "formalism" is (not nice but) serious, in the sense that it tak=
es=20
us further away from abstract categories.

Anyway, we need to know, if it is still possible, how exactly did Bourbak=
i=20
definition of morphism(s) came up.
