I had an idea and I'd like to know whether you like it and some advice on
making it work if you do. 


There are quite a few interesting tales about category theorists around. I
think it will be a shame to lose this more human history as time passes
and us newer category theorists can't completely remember the stories....
So I'd like to set up a kind of archive - a sort of myths and legends of
the category theorists (but preferably more truth than myth!).

This is the plan so far (assuming you think this is not a terrible idea).

Format:
An email-style archive with tales/histories/mini-biographies submitted by
email in plain text and linked to from a page of titles (titles would
include rough dates, authors and characters - which would make it easily
searchable so you can easily read about your particular heroes!).

Procedure:
Email sent to me which would have to be accepted by every living character
in the story (for obvious reasons). Some procedure should be agreed for
the acceptance of stories about people no longer alive.
The best stories, I guess, will be those people write about themselves.

This is just an idea, I hope you will let me know whether you approve.

--Anne.
