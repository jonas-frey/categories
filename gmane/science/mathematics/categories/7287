The reason why category theory "is what it is" is that

it is the language that allows to define the notion of universal=20
property in its right generality.

The notion of universal property first appears in Bourbaki, which=20
decided not to use the language of categories to formulate it, on spite=20
of the advice of Grothendieck.
