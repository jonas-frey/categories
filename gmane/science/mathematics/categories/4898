Interestingly, software industry is heading in the opposite --
patent-free -- direction. It's called Open source software
development, and it is tremendously popular. There are several
impressive examples, such as the extremely successful Eclipse project
http://www.eclipse.org, (btw, Eclipse is partly based on categorical
ideas that engineers developed/reinvented from scratch).  Another
example is the use of open source software for commercial products by
such giants as IBM. (Of course, building legal foundations for this is
a separate story but somehow they managed it.) I have a feeling
(though i maybe wrong), that patenting is becoming an outdated
enterprise in the internet era.
