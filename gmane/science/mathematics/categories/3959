Cher Fred,

Merci pour ta reponse rapide. Although your french is perfect, I
shall continue in english, for the persons who are less familiar with
french.

(i) Your "guess" about cartesian closed categories is most certainly
correct. I knew that Eilenberg/Kelly had explicitly used this name
in their La Jolla paper, and it is probably the first instance,
because "closed", in this sense, was first introduced in that paper,
as far as I know..

(ii) Your "guess" about cartesian  is not correct. Neither in Tohoku,
nor in much later papers of his or any of his students, and also by
me, was cartesian used in the sense of category with finite limits.
If Grothendieck had used this
name, which he has not, my "guess" is that he would have called
cartesian categories with pull backs , because he and his students
used the name "cartesian square"  for square which is a pull back.
Moreover this is special case of his notion of cartesian  map in
a fibration.

(iii) I agree with you on the idea that the "natural" definition of
locally  cartesian closed category  should not  imply the existence
of a terminal  object. If I asked the question, it is because in
Johnstone's "Elephant" he does assume a terminal  object. Has such an
assumption become, now, commonly accepted in the definition ?

Thanks again, to you of course, and to whoever will help me to clarify
(ii) and (iii)

Jean
