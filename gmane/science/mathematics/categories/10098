Hi David,

Your message caught my attention on my spam tray by Gmail's fault.

I'm not sure what proof would be nice to you, but as far as I could see,
the construction of a symmetric monoidality of the multiplication of a
> _symmetric_ monoidal category is largely trivial. Let Fin denote the
category of finite sets. Then, a symmetric monoidal category (C,@) gives
you a symmetric monoidal functor Fin ---> Cat which associates to a finite
set S the category C^S. The symmetric monoidal structure of C x C gives
you a symmetric monoidal structure on the functor Fin ---> Cat
associating C^S x C^S to S. Inspecting this symmetric monoidal functor,
you further obtain a map of these symmetric monoidal functors which
associates to S the multiplication functor
C^S x C^S ---> C^S induced from the codiagonal map S + S ---> S, where
"+" in the source denotes the coproduct operation in
Fin. This is the desired structure.

As you see, we have used the symmetric monoidality of the product
functor Cat x Cat ---> Cat, which you have because the Cartesian product
is a limit so preserves products. Thus, a reference you are looking for
may be

Graeme Segal, Categories and cohomology theories, Topology 13 (1974),

which essentially contains a sufficient argument for this (and is indeed
earlier than Joyal=E2=80=93Street).

To conclude, "commutation with the braiding" comes immediately from
the naturality of the codiagonal map, to commute with any
automorphism of a finite set.

Best regards,
Takuo Matsuoka
