My suggestion would be the theorem that left adjoints preserve colimits,
and right adjoints preserve limits.

This may not be the deepest theorem in category theory, but

(a) it's pretty darn deep,
(b) it describes a beautiful connection between two fundamental notions
in the subject,
(c) it admits a huge variety of applications in "ordinary" mathematics.

I've occasionally referred to this theorem as the Fundamental Theorem of
Category Theory by way of emphasizing its importance while teaching, but
I've always immediately clarified that it's only me who uses this term :-)
