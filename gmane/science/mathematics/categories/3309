David,

When you have `bad' quotients you can look at the equivalence relation, a
special case of a groupoid. In the case of subgroups H < G, then you also
get a covering groupoid G' \to G with vertex groups isomorphic to H.  If you
want more than one subgroup, you might need global actions or groupoid
atlases

http://www.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/public/mathematics/research/preprints/06/algtop06.html#06.02

Perhaps you can find `bad' quotients which nonetheless have `good' holonomy
groupoids, analogously to the foliation case? That would be good, but is it
too naive an idea? On the other hand, an irrational flow on a torus gives a
foliation of the torus which has a smooth holonomy groupoid.

see preprint 06.03  and the information there for some ideas on holonomy.
