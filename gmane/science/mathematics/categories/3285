Dear All,

This is to remind you that abstracts for the FMCS'06 meeting in
Kananaskis, June 7-9, are due on Friday, May 21st. Since we have almost
reached the maximum number of participants for the event, it is
especially important for those who are planning to come but who haven't
confirmed this yet to send me an e-mail as soon as possible. (The list
of confirmed participants can be found on the website below.)
Due to the limited capacity of the facilities of the Field Stations,
where the meeting will be held, we unfortunately cannot guarantee a
place for people who attempt a last minute registration.

More information about the meeting (which will be held right after the
Categories and Semigroup Workshop and the CMS 2006 Summer Meeting) can
be found here:

If you are planning to come but are in doubt whether your participation
is confirmed, please check the participants list at:

If you have any questions about any of the meetings, do not hesitate to
send me an e-mail at
