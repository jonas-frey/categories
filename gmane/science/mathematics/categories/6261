Though we can always make such a simultaneous choice as soon as we
have it in one particular case. Given the Grothendieck fibration p:
E->B in Cat, and letting X denote the comma object (B,p), it is enough
to choose a lifting for the X-indexed family of morphisms of B
corresponding to the projection X --> B^2 at the X-indexed family of
objects of E corresponding to the projection X --> E; for then to give
a Y-indexed family of morphisms in B and a Y-indexed family of objects
of E over their codomains is to give a morphism Y -> X, and so the
chosen lifting for the latter induces a chosen lifting for the former.
