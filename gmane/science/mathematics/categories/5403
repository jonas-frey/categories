Dear Zinovy,

I can say that I dislike your selling/marketing despair and do not share
excitement in the existence of an easy niche market you propose.

Unlike your search for an easy "customer", I am CONVINCED that really
interaction with central parts of mathematics which you find CONCURRENT in
some odious market sense, is the main and natural one I could
intellectually, artisticially and purposefully like to find in interaction
with category theory. It can not satisfy me knowing that some PARTs of
category theory can be easily sold to
your proposed customer, if I know that some natural parts are INTRINSICALLY
interwoven with many other subjects and this is ignored. I do not think that
the category theorists should approach other
mathematicians/computerists/others just to find SOME company to share what
they know, but rather because they find a natural need to do so. I do not
talk to person A because I have nobody else to talk to, but because I am
interested in what specifically person A can offer in the communication.
This said I can not replace person A with different person B who has other
values to enhance me.

This is not to diminish software engineering as a valuable field of
interaction, but having software engineers accept category theory, does not
solve the problem that some who should accept category theory do not. Many
category theorists themselvses are of the same ignorant kind by not
accepting higher category theory and homotopy theory which are naturally
form a whole with classical category theory.
