It is with great sadness I write to let you know that our friend
Aurelio Carboni died peacefully this morning, 11 December 2012.

We had been friends and collaborators since I first met him in 1980.
I know that all of you who knew him personally will share my distress at
his passing.
We remember his friendship, his spirit, his humour and his passion for
mathematical research.
It is a great loss to the Category Theory community.

best regards
Bob Walters
