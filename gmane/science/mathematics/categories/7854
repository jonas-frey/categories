There are some forms of set theory in which there are restrictions on =
the forms of comprehension allowed, and as a result there is a set of =
all sets. Quine's New Foundations is one of these. It has a simple =
restriction on the forms of predicates allowed in comprehensions. Put =
simply this is that you can assign (integer) levels to the variables in =
the formula so that x e y only occurs when y is at the level immediately =
above x. This means that in models of this set theory there is also an =
internal category of all sets.=20
