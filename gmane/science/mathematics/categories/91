Dear Tony,

As you say, this depends on how the monoidal structures on the functor
categories are defined. The only sensible way I know of which uses the given
structures on A and B is by Day convolution, and then your result will hold
if F itself is strong monoidal.

See the Day-Street paper "Kan extensions along promonoidal functors" in
volume 1 of TAC.

Regards,

Steve Lack.
