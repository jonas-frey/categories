Let me expand. If one bores into just why  Set^2_kf  can't be
boolean and looks for a minimal example of its non-booleaness
one inevitably lands on the object  2 -> 1. At first blush
its lattice of subobjects does look boolean. Until one notices
that there's a monomorphism from  2 -> 2  to  2 -> 1 (where
2 -> 2  is the identity map).

Having noticed that, one has a quicker proof that it's not a
topos: not every mono-epi is an equalizer.
