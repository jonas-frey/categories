Mark Hovey's letter of 26 Dec - known as Boxing Day in the British-speaking
world - suggests that it might be a good idea to develop a theory of local
presentability and all that in the context of enriched categories. In fact
such a theory was developed in my paper [Structures defined by finite limits
in the enriched context I, Cahiers de Top. et Geom. Differentielles 23 (1982),
3 - 42]. Everything works very smoothly; but there are a few annoying
misprints, many of which seem to be my own fault. Further developments can be 
found in [Blackwell-Kelly-Power, Two-dimensional monad theory, J. Pure Appl. 
Algebra 59 (1989), 1 - 41] and in [Kelly-Power, Adjunctions whose counits are 
coequalizers and presentations of finitary enriched monads, J. Pure Appl. 
Algebra 89 (1993), 163 - 179], among other papers of myself and of others;
Brian Day, Steve Lack, John Power, and Ross Street have all written on related
matters.

Please accept, Mark, my best wishes for your future work in this direction. In 
any case, New Year's Eve is a fine time to send greetings more generally to
Bob and all on this Bulletin Board.

Warm regards - Max Kelly.
