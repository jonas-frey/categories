                    CALL FOR PAPERS - ICALP'08

                 35th International Colloquium on
               Automata,  Languages and Programming

                July 6-13, 2008, Reykjavik, Iceland

___________________________________________________________________

The 35th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and
Programming, the main conference and annual meeting of the European
Association for Theoretical Computer Science EATCS will take place
from the 6th to the 13th of July 2008 in Reykjavik, Iceland. The main
conference will take place from the 7th till the 11th of July, and
will be preceded and followed by 13 co-located events. (See
http://www.ru.is/icalp08/workshops.html for the list of events
affiliated with ICALP 2008.) In addition, the ETACS award 2008 and the
Goedel prize 2008 will be awarded at the conference.

Following the successful experience of the last three editions, ICALP
2008 will complement the established structure of the scientific
program based on Track A on Algorithms, Automata, Complexity and
Games, and Track B on Logic, Semantics, and Theory of Programming,
corresponding to the two main streams of the journal Theoretical
Computer Science, with a special Track C on Security and Cryptography
Foundations The aim of Track C is to allow a deeper coverage of a
particular topic, to be specifically selected for each year's edition
of ICALP on the basis of its timeliness and relevance for the
theoretical computer science community.

Papers presenting original research on all aspects of theoretical
computer science are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of
interest are:

Track A - Algorithms, Automata, Complexity and Games:

    * Algorithmic Aspects of Networks
    * Algorithmic Game Theory
    * Approximation Algorithms
    * Automata Theory
    * Combinatorics in Computer Science
    * Computational Biology
    * Computational Complexity
    * Computational Geometry
    * Data Structures
    * Design and Analysis of Algorithms
    * Internet Algorithmics
    * Machine Learning
    * Parallel, Distributed and External Memory Computing
    * Randomness in Computation
    * Quantum Computing

Track B - Logic, Semantics, and Theory of Programming:

    * Algebraic and Categorical Models
    * Automata and Formal Languages
    * Emerging and Non-standard Models of Computation
    * Databases, Semi-Structured Data and Finite Model Theory
    * Principles of Programming Languages
    * Logics, Formal Methods and Model Checking
    * Models of Concurrent, Distributed, and Mobile Systems
    * Models of Reactive, Hybrid and Stochastic Systems
    * Program Analysis and Transformation
    * Specification, Refinement and Verification
    * Type Systems and Theory, Typed Calculi

Track C - Security and Cryptography Foundations:

    * Cryptographic Notions, Mechanisms, Systems and Protocols
    * Cryptographic Proof Techniques, Lower bounds, Impossibilities
    * Foundations of Secure Systems and Architectures
    * Logic and Semantics of Security Protocols
    * Number Theory and Algebraic Algorithms (Primarily in Cryptography)
    * Pseudorandomness, Randomness, and Complexity Issues
    * Secure Data Structures, Storage, Databases and Content
    * Security Modeling: Combinatorics, Graphs, Games, Economics
    * Specifications, Verifications and Secure Programming
    * Theory of Privacy and Anonymity
    * Theory of Security in Networks and Distributed Computing
    * Quantum Cryptography and Information Theory

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract of no more than 12
pages in LNCS style presenting original research on the theory of
Computer Science. Submissions should indicate to which track (A, B, or
C) the paper is submitted. No simultaneous submission to other
publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed. The
proceedings will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
Series by Springer-Verlag.

It is recommended that submissions adhere to the specified format and
length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected
immediately. Additional material intended for the referee but not for
publication in the final version - for example details of proofs - may
be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the
page limit.

Submissions to ICALP 2008 are now open. To submit a paper to the
conference, please visit the URL
