Submission will be in two stages: a short abstract due on 8 February and
the 12-page paper due on 15 February 2008. The results of the paper must
be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including
journals and the proceedings of other symposia or workshops. Authors
will be notified of acceptance or rejection via e-mail by 31 March. Full
versions of accepted papers (camera-ready) must be written in English,
and will be due by 22 April 2008. One author of each accepted paper
should present it at the conference.

Scope and Topics
TCS2008 will be composed of two distinct, but interrelated tracks: Track
A on Algorithms, Complexity and Models of Computation, and Track B on
Logic, Semantics, Specification and Verification.

Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest include:

Track A - Algorithms, Complexity and Models of Computation Analysis and
design of algorithms; Automata and formal languages; Cellular automata
and systems; Combinatorial, graph and optimization algorithms;
Computational learning theory; Computational complexity; Computational
geometry; Cryptography; Descriptive complexity; Evolutionary and genetic
computing; Experimental algorithms; Mobile computing; Molecular
computing and algorithmic aspects of bioinformatics; Network computing;
Neural computing; Parallel and distributed algorithms; Probabilistic and
randomized algorithms; Quantum computing; Structural information and
communication complexity.

Track B - Logic, Semantics, Specification and Verification Automata
theory; automated deduction; constructive and non-standard logics in
computer science; concurrency theory and foundations of distributed and
mobile computing; database theory; finite model theory; formal aspects
of program analysis, foundations of hybrid and real-time systems; lambda
and combinatory calculi; logical aspects of computational complexity;
modal and temporal logics; model checking and verification;
probabilistic systems; logics and semantics of programs; foundations of
security; term rewriting; specifications; type, proof and category
theory in computer science.

Paper submission
Papers presenting original research in conference topics are being
sought. The proceedings will be published by SSBM (Springer Science and
Business Media). Submissions, as well as final versions, are limited to
12 pages, in the final SSBM format. The instructions for preparing the
papers can be downloaded from
http://www.springeronline.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,11855,4-40492-0-0- or
ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/ifip/ .

Only electronic submissions will be accepted, via
Track A: http://www.easychair.org/TCS2008-TrackA
Track B: http://www.easychair.org/TCS2008-TrackB

The submission deadline, length limitations and formatting instructions
are firm: any submissions that deviate from these may be rejected
without further considerations.

IMPORTANT DATES:
8 February 2008: Abstract submission deadline
15 February 2008: 12-page paper submission deadline
31 March 2008: Notification of acceptance
7 April 2008: Copyright release submission deadline
22 April 2008: Camera-ready copy submission deadline

Organized by IFIP Technical Committee 1 (Foundations of Computer
Science) and IFIP WG 2.2 (Formal Descriptions of Programming Concepts)
in association with SIGACT and EATCS
