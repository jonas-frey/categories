Yes, I agree.

No, I don't think this is enough for local presentability.

If (as well as both functors being accessible and one being an isofibration)
both functors were continuous then the pullback would be complete and so
locally presentable. If both were cocontinuous, then the pullback would be
cocomplete and so locally presentable. But monadicity of one is not enough.

For example, let A be the full subcategory of Set consisting of all
one-element sets. The inclusion and both A and Set are locally presentable.
Now choose any functor 1-->Set whose image is not a singleton. This is
accessible, and 1 is locally presentable. The pullback of A->Set and 1->Set
is empty, so not locally presentable.

Steve.
