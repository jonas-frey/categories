What about "dangerous" rather than "evil"? (I also dislike religious and=20
moral terminology for mathematics. I specially dislike the terminology=20
"morally true", which I often hear, although I like the concept.)

We frequently encounter dangerous situations in our mathematical paths,=20
no matter how hard we try to avoid them, but if we know what we are=20
doing it is ok.

In this discussion about "evilness", what is important is to know that=20
lack of invariance under isomorphisms is dangerous (and why this is so),=20
and that you must consciously know how to properly proceed if your=20
definition happens to be not invariant, be it for necessity, lack of a=20
better idea, or mere convenience.
