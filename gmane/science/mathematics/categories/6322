Dear categorists,

A new preprint about higher dimensional transition systems which is the sequel
of my previous work "Directed algebraic topology and higher dimensional
transition system". The previous paper was accepted last June to the New York
Journal of Mathematics but for unknown reasons, everything is blocked in this
journal (no new publications since June 15th !!). So the first paper is still
available only in my webpage and in ArXiv. I will resubmit it soon with this
new one.

Here is now the new preprint:

Title:  Towards a homotopy theory of higher dimensional transition systems

Abstract: We proved in a previous work that Cattani-Sassone's higher
dimensional transition systems can be interpreted as a small-orthogonality
class of a topological locally finitely presentable category of weak higher
dimensional transition systems. In this paper, we turn our attention to the
full subcategory of weak higher dimensional transition systems which are
unions of cubes. It is proved that not only this category is locally finitely
presentable as well, but also that there exists a left proper combinatorial
model structure such that two objects are weakly equivalent if and only if
they have the same cubes up to the first Cattani-Sassone axiom. This model
structure is obtained by Bousfield localizing a model structure which is left
determined with respect to a class of maps strictly larger than the class of
monomorphisms. We also prove that two weakly equivalent higher dimensional
transition systems are bisimilar with a very general notion of bisimulation
and that the higher dimensional transition systems corresponding to two
process algebras are weakly equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic. The
appendix contains a technical lemma about smallness of weak factorization
systems in coreflective subcategories which can be of independent interest.
This paper is a first step towards a homotopical interpretation of bisimulation
for higher dimensional transition systems.
