15th International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques
                                 joint with
             General Workshop of the CoFI WG & CASL Tutorial

                               Genova, Italy
                               1-3 April 2001
                     http://www.disi.unige.it/wadt2001/

Aims and Scope
==============
The  algebraic approach to system  specification and development, born
as a formal  method for  abstract  data types,  encompasses today  the
formal    design of integrated  hardware    and software systems,  new
specification   frameworks     and programming  paradigms    (such  as
object-oriented, logic and  higher-order functional programming) and a
wide  range of   application  areas (including  information   systems,
concurrent and distributed systems).

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

   -   algebraic specification
   -   other approaches to formal specification
   -   specification languages and methods
   -   term rewriting and proof systems
   -   specification development systems (concepts, tools, etc.)

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

The workshop will start with a full day tutorial on CoFI, the Common
Framework Initiative for algebraic specification and development of
software, see http://www.brics.dk/Projects/CoFI.  This tutorial will
also be available to people who do not wish to participate in the rest
of the workshop.  Besides the tutorial, there will be CoFI Task Group
meetings and presentation on related topics during the workshop.

Selected presentations will  appear after the workshop as a volume of
Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science.

The workshop will be a satellite event of the European Joint Conferences
on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS2001).
Special deals will be available for participants wishing to attend
WADT/CoFI 2001 together with other events of ETAPS.

SEE THE ETAPS EXCITING PROGRAM  AT http://www.disi.unige.it/etaps2001/.

Submissions
===========

The scientific programme of the workshop will include up to about 30
presentations of recent results and ongoing research.  The presentations
will be selected according to originality, significance, and general
interest, on the basis of submitted abstracts.  The selection committee
consists of the WADT Steering Committee together with the local organizers
(listed below).

The abstracts must be in pdf (or standard postscript) format, up to 2 pages
long in the style for publication in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html), and should be sent by
e-mail to wadt2001@disi.unige.it.

The deadline for submission of abstracts is

    10 January, 2001.

Abstracts that substantially depart from the required format, style or
length may be rejected without consideration.

The final versions of the selected abstracts (due by 26 February) will be
made available on the workshop web page, and included in a hand-out for the
workshop participants.

After the workshop, selected authors will be invited to submit full
papers for the refereed proceedings, which will be published
as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/).

Location
========
WADT/CoFI 2001 will be held in Genova.
