Call for Papers

*** FICS 2015 ***

   http://www.irit.fr/FICS2015/

                International Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science
                Berlin, 11-12 September 2015
                satellite of the International Conference CSL 2015
                (Computer Science Logic)




IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract submission:         Monday, June 16
Paper submission:            Monday, June 23
Notification:                Monday, July 27
Final version:               Monday, August 24

BACKGROUND

Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer science.
They are used to justify (co)recursive definitions and associated reasoning
techniques. The construction and properties of fixed points have been
investigated in many different settings such as: design and implementation
of programming languages, logics, verification, databases.

The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers to present
their results to those members of the computer science and logic communities
who study or apply the theory of fixed points.

Topics include, but are not restricted to:

    * fixed points in algebra and coalgebra
    * fixed points in formal languages and automata
    * fixed points in game theory
    * fixed points in programming language semantics
    * fixed points in the mu-calculus and modal logics
    * fixed points in process algebras and process calculi
    * fixed points in functional programming and type theory
    * fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits
    * fixed points in logic programming and theorem proving
    * fixed points in finite model theory, descriptive complexity theory,
      and databases
    * fixed points in category theory for logic in computer science

TWO INVITED SPEAKERS

    * To be announced

SUBMISSION

The selection of contributed talks will be based on extended abstracts/short
papers describing original results in sufficient detail to constitute a
publication. Submission is via EasyChair:
    https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fics2015

Accepted papers will be published through the open-access venue EPTCS.
Submissions should be composed using LaTeX and, preferably, using the
EPTCS style:
    http://style.eptcs.org/

Typical submissions would be 8 pages long but submissions in the range
[6,15] pages will be considered acceptable.

JOURNAL PUBLICATION

If the number and quality of submissions justifies it, a subsequent
special issue of a journal will be prepared with extended versions of
selected papers. A special issue of FICS 2013 is in preparation and
will appear in Fundamenta Informaticae.
