Dear category theorists,

a new postdoc position is advertised at Dalhousie, which could be of
interest to some of the readers of this list. The position is 50%
research and 50% outreach activities. The research could be, for
example, in category theory. Applications are due on May 4, 2015
(note: that's only 2 weeks away!), and the position would start in
August or September. See more details below.

==============================

The Atlantic Association of Research in the Mathematical Sciences
(AARMS) and the department of Mathematics and Statistics at Dalhousie
University are advertizing a post-doctoral fellowship with duties in
outreach coordination. The post-doctoral fellow will spend 50% of her or
his duties on research, and 50% on outreach coordination and
communication, see job description below. The research area of the

supervision of the PDF.

The outreach coordinator duties consist of the following:

* Establish and maintain relations with the initiators and
   participants of various outreach activities associated with AARMS
* Help develop and maintain on-line resources such as a Web page,
   social media presence, bank of on-line resources
* Help in reporting on the activities to various sponsors
* Help in organization of outreach events
* Participate in some of the outreach activities (Math Circles, math camps)

The outreach coordinator should have a PhD by September 2015, and should
have obtained it no earier than 2011, and she or he should have an
interest in Math outreach, good social and organizational skills, and
preferably have some experience in outreach and/or event coordination.

Salary will be $40,000. Terms of employment will conform to
post-doctoral fellowship positions at Dalhousie University. The
position is for one year, starting August or September 2015. The
position is renewable for a second year subject to budgetary approval.

For more information on AARMS, see www.aarms.math.ca
<http://www.aarms.math.ca/>

To apply, please send the following:

* a CV (which includes relevant experience on outreach and organization),
* The names of three references: two research references, and one
   reference of someone who can comment on your skills relevant to outreach
   and organization
* the name of the proposed PDF supervisor

This should be sent before May via email to Queena Crooker-Smith at
