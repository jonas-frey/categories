Dear all,

The fact that the 'right' morphisms of topos theory (geometric morphisms) a=
re not structure preserving maps gives rise to the debate below. With an en=
tirely localic approach the situation can be recovered; but at the cost of =
moving from 'elementary topos' as primitive to 'category of locales'. Here =
geometric morphisms can be represented as adjunctions that commute with the=
  double power locale monad and it is the double power locale monad that giv=
es the structure in categories of locales. So there are avenues worth explo=
ring which may provide a way of marrying up the structural disconnect betwe=
en objects and morphisms that is implicit in topos theory. =

The "miracle disappears in confusion" is an important observation, as is th=
e need to "keep apart before uniting".

Syntax and semantics is like that, or meta and object language.
Foundations of mathematics without categorical consideration is basically t=
hen over  Set, naively speaking. Logic is similar. Fons et origo logic from=
  late 19th century and decades after is confused about being before set the=
ory or after. Topos internalizes logic but is different from the Goguen-Mes=
eguer approach to institutions and entailment systems. The apples and pears=
  of logic should not be seen as a fruit salad.

I've sometimes thought (and written some pieces about, e.g. to be found und=
er www.glioc.com<http://www.glioc.com>) what if G=F6del's Incompleteness  T=
heorem wasn't a Theorem but a Paradox. After all, G=F6del basically transfo=
rms the Liar Paradox to a Liar Theorem, and logicians at that time (except =
maybe Hilbert, but he was too old to quarrel) found it to be very smart.
However, if we use underlying categories and functors to start from signatu=
res, then create terms, then sentences, then entailments, then models, then=
  proof strategies, and so on, it means we close doors behind us, so that we=
  disable ourselves to mix truth and provability as being "of the same kind =
or type", which G=F6del did. Categorically, terms come from monads, because=
  they enable substitution, but sentences just from functors, because otherw=
ise everything is 'term'. The functorial description and generality of enta=
ilment and model is of course more tricky, in particular if the underlying =
category is something more elaborate (like monoidal closed categories) than=
  just Set.

In this (heretic?) view, G=F6del's Theorem/Paradox is actually an example w=
here that miracle appears because of the unintended (?) confusion, so this =
is why I sometimes think what if it was ween as a Paradox.

Best,

Patrik
