AiML-2012:  FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS


9-TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN MODAL LOGIC
COPENHAGEN, 22-25 AUGUST, 2012

            hylocore.ruc.dk/aiml2012


Advances in Modal Logic is an initiative aimed at presenting
the state of the art in modal logic and its various applications. The
initiative consists of a conference series together with volumes based
on the conferences. Information about the AiML series can be obtained at
http://www.aiml.net. AiML-2012 is the ninth
conference in the series.


TOPICS
We invite submission on all aspects of modal logic, including:

- history of modal logic
- philosophy of modal logic
- applications of modal logic
- computational aspects of modal logic
  + complexity and decidability of modal and temporal logics
  + modal and temporal logic programming
  + model checking
  + model generation
  + theorem proving for modal logics
- theoretical aspects of modal logic
  + algebraic  and categorical perspectives on modal logic
  + coalgebraic modal logic
  + completeness and canonicity
  + correspondence and duality theory
  + many-dimensional modal logics
  + modal fixed point logics
  + model theory of modal logic
  + proof theory of modal logic
- specific instances and variations of modal logic
  + description logics
  + modal logics over non-boolean bases
  + dynamic logics and other process logics
  + epistemic and deontic logics
  + modal logics for agent-based systems
  + modal logic and game theory
  + modal logic and grammar formalisms
  + provability and interpretability logics
  + spatial and temporal logics
  + hybrid logic
  + intuitionistic logic
  + substructural logics
  + computationally light fragments of all such logics

Papers on related subjects will also be considered.

INVITED SPEAKERS: TO BE ANNOUNCED

PAPER SUBMISSIONS
There will be two types of submissions to AiML-2012

(1) Full papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation at
the
conference.

(2) Abstracts for short presentation only.

Both types of papers should be submitted electronically using the
EasyChair submission page at
  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiml2012

(1) FULL PAPERS
Authors are invited to submit, for presentation at the conference and
publication in the proceedings, full papers reporting on original
research and not submitted elsewhere. The proceedings of AiML'2012 will
be published by College Publications
            http://www.collegepublications.co.uk
in a volume to be made available at the conference.

The submissions should be at most 15 pages, with an optional technical
appendix of up to 5 pages, together with a plain-text abstract of
100-200 words. The submissions must be typeset in LaTex, using a style
file and template that will be provided on the AiML'2012 website
  hylocore.ruc.dk/aiml2012.

(2) ABSTRACTS
These should be at most 5 pages. They may describe preliminary results,
work in progress etc., and will be subject to light reviewing. The
accepted abstracts will be made available at the conference, and the
authors will have the opportunity to make short presentations (of up to
15 minutes) on them.

At least one author of each accepted paper or abstract must register
for, and attend, the conference to present his or her work.


SPECIAL SESSION ON HYBRID LOGIC: Hybrid logic is an extension of modal
logic which allows us to  refer explicitly to states of the model in the
syntax of formulas. There will be a special session
of AiML devoted to papers on hybrid logic. The scope of the  special
session is standard hybrid-logical machinery like nominals,
satisfaction operators, and the downarrow binder, but also other
extensions of modal logic can be considered.Papers for this session
should be submitted the same way as others.
