       23rd British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science

                              BCTCS 2007

                            2-5 April 2007
                      St Anne's College, Oxford

                   http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/bctcs2007/

The purpose of BCTCS is to provide a forum in which researchers in
theoretical computer science can meet, present research findings,
and discuss developments in the field. It also aims to provide an
environment in which PhD students can gain experience in presenting
their work, and benefit from contact with established researchers.


SCOPE

All aspects of theoretical computer science, including automata
theory, algorithms, complexity theory, semantics, formal methods,
concurrency, types, languages and logics. Computer scientists and
mathematicians are welcome to attend, as are participants from
outside the UK.


PROGRAMME

The programme  will consist of nearly 3 days worth of invited and
contributed talks, beginning at 5.30pm on Monday 2nd April and
concluding at 1pm on Thursday 5th April 2007. The abstracts of the
talks will be published in the Bulletin of the European Association
for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS).

The invited speakers are as follows:

    Dimitris Achlioptas, University of California, Santa Cruz, U.S.A.
        "Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems:
         from Physics to Algorithms"

    Steven Alpern, The London School of Economics and Political Science
        "Search Games and Utilitarian Postman Paths on Networks"

    Julian Bradfield, University of Edinburgh
        (BCS-FACS Lecturer in Formal Methods)

    Georg Gottlob, University of Oxford
        "Living with Computational Complexity"
        (This is Prof. Gottlob's inaugural lecture at Oxford University.)

    Bob Harper, Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.A.

    Richard Jozsa, University of Bristol

    Kristina Vuskovic, University of Leeds
        (LMS Lecturer in Discrete Mathematics)



LOCATION

The 2007 colloquium will be held at St Anne's College, Oxford, one
of the colleges of the University of Oxford, and hosted by the
computing departments of both Oxford Brookes and Oxford universities,
Oxford itself is known as the "City of Dreaming Spires", and has
been home to both royalty and scholars for over 800 years.


REGISTRATION

Registration for BCTCS2007 is open, via the web page.
The deadline for registration and submission of abstracts for
proposed talks is 16th February 2007.  The registration fee is
340 UK pounds, including accommodation and meals, and the day
rate is 145 UK pounds. A number of free registrations for
UK-based PhD students are available.


SPONSORS

The colloquium is sponsored by EPSRC, BCS-FACS, and also the
London Mathematical Society.
