Here's a thought that may seem a bit off-topic, having more to do, =

at first glance, with "paradoxical" logic than with categories.

Eleven years ago, for a conference in Bangalore [1], I was trying to =

present natural-seeming examples of statements P each illustrating =

another of the four distinct, mutually exclusive, jointly exhaustive, =

and individually indispensable "logical possibilities" thought available =

for P in the logic of the Hindu catuskoti, or Tetralemma principle: that,=

given P, one have either P, or ~P, or both P and ~P, or neither P nor ~P.=


(Note that an Aristotelean would hold that already P and ~P are mutually =

exclusive and jointly exhaustive, so that the last two are simply false,
hence utterly dispensable.)

The only illustrations I could come up with back then for a P with =

"neither P nor ~P" always struck me as somewhat artificial; so that =

I was greatly heartened, recently, to stumble on a far more natural =

illustration as outgrowth of a discussant's sardonic comment, concluding =

his remarks on how contemporary web page design strategies needed to be =

modified to take into account the fact that *touch* is more and more =

replacing *mouse cursor and click* as the user interface of choice: =


"Change is good."

Well, he didn't mean it, of course: he said it entirely tongue-in-cheek. =

But it hit me: that's a superb illustration of a P with "neither P nor ~P=
":
for, in fact (in my view), such "change" is neither good nor not good -- =
it =

just is, and may need to be accommodated :-) ).

Enjoy! And cheers, -- Fred
