Dear Steve,

I have been working on very similar ideas for my PhD thesis.

If R is the real line, then R[X] has at least 3 reasonable topologies: the
compact-open topology, the Whitney topology and the coarsest topology
making the coefficient maps continuous. None of these gives a localic ring
since they are not complete. Their completions are, of course, the ring of
continuous functions on R, the ring of smooth functions on R and the ring
of formal power series R[[X]], respectively. Perhaps this indicates that
these are more appropriate than the polynomial ring when R has a
non-discrete topology.

It seems to me that the classical Zariski spectrum is only correct for
discrete rings. The most obvious example where it gives pathological
results is for the ring of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff
space. For Gelfand duality we must consider not all the ideals, but only
the closed ideals. The Zariski spectrum is given by taking the localic
reflection of the quantale of ideals of a discrete ring. For a localic
ring, I believe we should instead take the localic reflection of the
quantale of overt ideals. This should give the expected results for both
discrete rings and for rings of continuous functions. For the localic rings
above, I expect R to appear inside the spectrum with its usual topology,
but I've only checked this in the first two cases.

I don't know if the construction of the quantale of overt ideals from a
localic ring is geometric. I think it might not be. There is a geometric
theory that gives the elements of this quantale as its points. This
tentatively suggests to me that the resulting spectrum will not be a
locale, but a colocale, but you know much more about these than I do.

I have thought less about the corresponding 'sheaf'. In particular, I do
not know what the correct notion of localic local ring is. I found some
work on localisation of topological rings (see here
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166864194900353>), but
I haven't thought how this would work in the pointfree setting.

Best regards,

Graham
