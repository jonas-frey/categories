				   TAP 2008
	     Second International Conference on Tests and Proofs

		April 9-11, 2008, Prato (near Florence), Italy

		      http://www.uni-koblenz.de/tap2008/


			      *CALL FOR PAPERS*


     SCOPE

The TAP conference is devoted to the convergence of proofs and tests.
It combines ideas from both sides for the advancement of software quality=
.

To prove the correctness of a program is to demonstrate, through impeccab=
le
mathematical techniques, that it has no bugs; to test a program is to run=
 it
with the expectation of discovering bugs. The two techniques seem
contradictory: if you have proved your program, it's fruitless to comb it=
 for
bugs; and if you are testing it, that is surely a sign that you have give=
n up
on any hope to prove its correctness.

Accordingly, proofs and tests have, since the onset of software engineeri=
ng
research, been pursued by distinct communities using rather different
techniques and tools.

And yet the development of both approaches leads to the discovery of comm=
on
issues and to the realization that each may need the other. The emergence=
 of
model checking has been one of the first signs that contradiction may yie=
ld to
complementarity, but in the past few years an increasing number of resear=
ch
efforts have encountered the need for combining proofs and tests, droppin=
g
earlier dogmatic views of incompatibility and taking instead the best of =
what
each of these software engineering domains has to offer.

      How does deduction help testing? How does testing help deduction?
 How can the combination of testing and deduction increase the reach of b=
oth?

     TOPICS

Topics include:

  - Generation of test data, oracles, or preambles by deductive technique=
s
    such as theorem proving, model checking, symbolic execution,
    constraint logic programming, etc.
  - Generation of specifications by deduction
  - Verification techniques combining proofs and tests
  - Program proving with the aid of testing techniques
  - Transfer of concepts from testing to proving (e.g., coverage criteria=
)
  - Automatic bug finding
  - Formal frameworks
  - Tool descriptions and experience reports
  - Case studies
