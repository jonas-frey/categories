We are pleased to announce an opening for a fully funded three-year PhD=20
position (E-13 on the German TV-L scale, full time, no teaching=20
obligation) at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit=C3=A4t Erlangen-N=C3=BCrnber=
g,=20
located at the Chair of Theoretical Computer Science. The position is=20
within the new DFG project "Coalgebraic Model Checking", with Stefan=20
Milius and Lutz Schr=C3=B6der as PIs and with Daniel Hausmann collaborati=
ng=20
on a second project position. The aim of the project is to develop a=20
generic framework for model checking a wide variety of logics beyond the =

standard relational setting, such as probabilistic, graded, or=20
alternating-time logics, based on the successful paradigm of coalgebraic =

logic.

The position is embedded into a large and active research group with a=20
highly collaborative spirit, see https://www8.cs.fau.de/ for more=20
details. Erlangen's technical campus is situated within pleasant=20
Franconia, and close to the vibrant city of Nuremberg. Please send=20
applications or further inquiries to the PIs at

     stefan.milius@fau.de   or
     lutz.schroeder@fau.de
