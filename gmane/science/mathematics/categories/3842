I would like to thank all those that I replied so far.

Quoting John Baez <baez@math.ucr.edu>:

To answer John, I would like to know what condition is required on =20
left and right adjoints in a 2-category K to ensure that a string =20
diagram representing a 2-morphism in K is invariant under topological =20
deformation restricting to the identity on the boundary.  I prefer not =20
to use monoidal 2-categories, just ordinary 2-categories/bicategories.

If I take a monoidal bicategory with duals and forget the monoidal =20
structure will this be what I am after?  2-tangles clearly have the =20
property I am looking for, but what if we adjoin some new 2-morphism A =20
to 2-tangles.  What condition would I need in order to ensure that any =20
string diagram with the new morphism A was invariant under topological =20
deformation?

> I'd be curious to know what if any replies you received.

Aside from the replies that have been posted, I have also received a =20
pointer to the paper "Introduction to linear bicategories" by Cockett, =20
Koslowski, and Seely.  The condition that *a=3Da* is studied in the =20
context of linear bicategories and what are called cyclic adjoints.  =20
In particular, the discussion of cyclic mates seems to especially =20
relevant.  But I have not finished reading the paper and am still =20
trying to understand what implications the `linear' in linear =20
bicatgories will have on the ordinary bicategory case.

Regards,
Aaron
