There's a result related to this (though not, I think, actually containing
it) in my paper with Andre Joyal on continuous categories and
exponentiable toposes (JPAA 25, 1982). We showed that there is an
equivalence (which is really a duality, but the arrows on one side
have been reversed) between quasi-injective toposes (that is, toposes
which occur as retracts of presheaf toposes) and the categories
that occur as their categories of points, which are continuous
categories satisfying a certain size restriction.
