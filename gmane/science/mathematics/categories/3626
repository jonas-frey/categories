Dear Category People

Max's son Simon has set up a web page that you might like to see:

www.maxkelly.com.au

I would also like to mention that I have been asked to write Max's
obituary for the Sydney Morning Herald, the Gazette of the Australian Math
Society, and the Australian Academy of Science. I am very grateful for the
many messages you have sent in the last couple of weeks. I would also be
grateful for any material that you think would be helpful to me in writing
these documents.

Ross
