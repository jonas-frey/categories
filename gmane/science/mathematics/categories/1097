i think there is a gap is in the step

        L(infinity) |- "L(n) is consistent"
        so L(infinity) proves its OWN consistency

formalized in a suitable category of theories and interpretations, paul's
construction, if i understand it correctly, refers to the colimit of the tower

        L(0) --> FL(0)  --> FFL(0)  -->...

where FX = X + replacement_X, so that FX |- "X is consistent".

IF the colimit of this tower, paul's L(infinity), were a fixpoint of F, THEN it
would indeed prove its own consistency. but it doesn't seem to be a fixpoint:
the restrictions of the replacement to L(0), FL(0) etc. do not imply the
replacement for L(infinity).

btw, i bought paul's book and warmly recommend it.
