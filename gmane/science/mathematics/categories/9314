Dear Marta,

I have to inform you with great sadness
that Fred died today at 5:47 a.m.
There were no cure for his illness
in the stage when it starts to manifest
its devastating symptoms.
Hospice at least gave him some
comfort and peace in this last moments.
I discovered it is really very humanitarian
institution.

Barbara
