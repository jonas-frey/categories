It is not clear if you are interested in special cases or in general
conditions.  If the latter, I cannot help, but here is an example of a
special case.  But first, I might ask why it matters.  Gabriel-Zisman
ignores the question and I think they are right to.  Every category is
small in another universe.  

Consider the category C of chain complexes from some abelian category. By
this I mean bounded below with a boundary operator of degree -1.  Arrows
are chain maps of degree 0.  Let S denote the class of homotopy
equivalences and T the class of homology isomorphisms.  Then S < T and
there is neither a calculus of right or left fractions for either.  On the
other hand S^{-1}C is equivalent to C/~ in which you have identified
homotopic arrows.  This is locally small because you leave the objects
alone and it is a quotient.  From S < T, it follows that T^{-1}C =
T^{-1}S^{-1}C = T^{-1}(C/~) and the image of T in C/~ does have a calculus
of fractions (both left and right; duality implies that they are
equivalent).  Thus there is a notion of homotopy calculus of fractions in
this case.  I have tried, without success, to find a general condition
of which this would be a special case.
