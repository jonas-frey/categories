Dear Colleagues,
   Registration is now open for MFPS 23. The meeting will be held on
the campus of Tulane University in New Orleans, LA from April 11
through April 14, 2007. The program features five plenary lectures
and four special sessions on topics ranging from security to systems
biology to physics, information and computation. A list of the
accepted papers and of the invited speakers is linked to the MFPS 23
home page http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps23.htm There is also a
link on the home page that leads to a registration form for the
meeting. In addition to the usual MFPS program, we will also hold a
Tutorial Day on April 10. The topic this year is domain theory, and
there will be lectures by Andrej Bauer, Achim Jung, Giuseppe Rosolini
and Alex Simpson. There is no charge to attend the Tutorial Day, and
graduate students are especially encouraged to attend.
   Best regards,
   Mike Mislove
