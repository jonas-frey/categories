Dear Ross,

concerning the internal hom of strict omega-categories:

>>> Given two strict omega-categories C and D, how do you define the

> 283-335

You know all this, but for the record I say the following:

The cartesian closed structure has an internal hom that is a
restriction of the internal hom wrt the Gray structure. Usually the
one of the Gray structure is the one of interest. It is the one closer
to the full oo-category theoretic notion (the one with no strictness
constraints whatsoever).

The Crans-Gray tensor product with its property that

  G^k otimes G^l

is k+l-dimensional is the fix in the globular model for what in the
simplicial model is automatic, namely that

   Delta^k x Delta^l

is k+l-dimensional. That this is automatic for the cartesian product
in simplicial sets but requires more work for globular sets is one of
the reasons why simplicial models for oo-categrories are more
highly-developed than globular ones: they are easier.

A good brief introduction to this is on the first few pages of Sjoerd Crans=
'

A tensor product for Gray-categories
  http://www.emis.de/journals/TAC/volumes/1999/n2/5-02abs.html

(After that introduction the article goes on to refine the globular
Gray tensor product to the case of _weak_  (or rather: semi-strict)
3-categories.)

But of course for the purposes of David's application (which I don't
know about) the strict version of the internal hom might be
sufficient.

Best,
Urs
