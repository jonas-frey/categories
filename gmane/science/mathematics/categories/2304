PSSL 79 - DOORN, THE NETHERLANDS - FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT

Dear all,

This is the final announcement for the 79th meeting of the Peripatetic Seminar
on Sheaves and Logic, which will be held in the weekend of the 28th and 29th of
June in Doorn, a place near Utrecht, the Netherlands. It is organized by the
University of Utrecht with financial support from the MRI, the Mathematical
Research Institute.

We are glad to announce that this edition will feature a 3 hours tutorial by
Clemens Berger on the subject of theta-categories, a topic from
higher-dimensional category theory.

The other confirmed speakers so far, are:

Steve Awodey (Carnegie Mellon)
Erik Palmgren (Uppsala University)
Jonas Eliasson (Uppsala University)
Christopher Mulvey (University of Sussex)

The PSSL will take place at the conference centre "Kaap Doorn". The conference
centre also offers rooms and meals, but only people who react before Friday the
6th of June are guaranteed to be offered this opportunity.

FOR THIS REASON WE KINDLY URGE THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED TO REGISTER BEFORE THE
6TH OF JUNE.
(People who respond at a later date may have to stay at a hotel. In that case,
special arrangements have to be made.)

The all-in price for staying at the conference centre is 200-250 euro's.

For further information and the latest list of participants, please consult
the webpage (now fully operational):
http://www.math.uu.nl/people/vdberg/PSSL79

People who wish to attend the PSSL should send an e-mail to vdberg@math.uu.nl
indicating whether they you want to give a talk. Questions should be posted to
the same address.

With best regards,

The organizers,

Jaap van Oosten
Federico de Marchi
Pieter Hofstra
