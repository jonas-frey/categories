I am deeply saddened by the death of Max Kelly. When I saw the subject in
Ross posting, and before opening the message, my heart already felt
anguish. I am more saddened with his loss that what I have been by the
loss of any other member of our category theory community. In fact, I
loved Max. I admired his courage, his independence of thought, his lack of
hypocrisy, and I loved him simply by the way he was. I am proud that he
considered me his friend. For me, our community is not the same without
Max.
