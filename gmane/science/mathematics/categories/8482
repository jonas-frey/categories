Dear colleagues,

It is with great sorrow that I inform you of our loss of RFC Walters.

Bob has been a highly valued friend and collaborator for several decades.

One of the organizers of the Sydney Category Seminar, as well as of 
International meetings at Como, his contributions to pure and applied 
category theory remain of fundamental value in many diverse disciplines. 
He published one of the first books applying category theory to computer 
science, and was one of the main developers of Yoneda structures and other 
explicit concepts guiding category theory in geometry and logic.

He is sadly missed by his friends and his colleagues all over the world.

My deepest condolences go to his family.

Bill Lawvere
