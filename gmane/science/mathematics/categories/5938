ESSLLI 2010 / UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN / DENMARK / AUGUST 9-20, 2010

http://esslli2010cph.info/

The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI)
is organized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and
Information (FoLLI) in different sites around Europe. The main focus
of ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics, logic and
computation. ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and advanced
courses, as well as workshops, covering a wide variety of topics
within the three areas of interest: Language and Computation, Language
and Logic, and Logic and Computation.

Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to
500 students from Europe and elsewhere. The school has developed into
an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and
researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of Logic,
Language and Information. During two weeks,46 foundational, introductory
and advanced courses + 6 workshops headed by some of the most
prominent scholars in the fields are offered to the attendants, each of 1.5
hours per day during a five days week, with up to seven parallel sessions.
ESSLLI also includes a student session (papers and posters by students only=
,
1.5 hour per day during the two weeks) and four evening lectures by
senior scientists in the covered areas.

In 2010, the venue for ESSLLI will be The University of Copenhagen,
Denmark. Chair of the Program Committee is Valentin Goranko (The
Technical University of Denmark), and Chair of the Organizing
Committee is Vincent F. Hendricks (The University of Copenhagen).
