LFCS TOPICS of interest include, but are not limited to: constructive
mathematics and type theory; homotopy type theory; logic, automata, and
automatic structures; computability and randomness; logical foundations of
programming; logical aspects of computational complexity; parameterized
complexity;  logic programming and constraints; automated deduction and
interactive theorem proving; logical methods in protocol and program
verification;  logical methods in program specification and extraction;
domain theory logics; logical foundations of database theory; equational
logic and term rewriting; lambda and combinatory calculi; categorical logic
and topological semantics; linear logic; epistemic and temporal logics;
intelligent and multiple agent system logics; logics of proof and
justification; nonmonotonic reasoning; logic in game theory and social
software; logic of hybrid systems; distributed system logics; mathematical
fuzzy logic; system design logics; other logics in computer science.

SUBMISSION DETAILS. Proceedings will be published in the Springer LNCS
series. There will be a post-conference volume of selected works published.

About LFCS.
The LFCS series provides an outlet for the fast-growing body of work in the
logical foundations of computer science, e.g., areas of fundamental
theoretical logic related to computer science. The LFCS series began with
Logic at Botik, Pereslavl-Zalessky, 1989 and was co-organized by Albert R.
Meyer (MIT) and Michael Taitslin (Tver), after which organization passed to
Anil Nerode in 1992. LFCS has enjoyed support and endorsements from a
number of bodies, including the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and
the City University of New York Research Foundation.
