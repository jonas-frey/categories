The location:
Located near the equatorial line in the northeastern coast of Brazil,
Fortaleza, the capital of the state of Ceara', lies by the beach between the
Ceara' and the Coco' rivers, in the middle of 570km (360mi) of sandy beaches
of the State's coast. The hightest point in the city is only 30m (100ft) high
and its beach front is formed of sand dunes up to 10m high and coconut trees.
The weather is dry and sunny. A permanent breeze comes from the ocean and keeps
the air clean and healthy while the temperature rests on a nice level year
around. The lack of rain during most of the year, now a blessing for the
visitors, prevented a definitive settlement in the area of Fortaleza until the
middle of the 17th century. At that time, need to assure the hold of the land,
the Portuguese established the "Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora da Assuncao" in the
same place where a hundred years before the dutch had built the
Schoonenbroch Fort. Fortaleza, named after the fortress, has been since then an
important trading center and an artistic and cultural center of the country.
