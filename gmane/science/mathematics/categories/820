Actually, many people write Abelian group and some people write cartesian
product.  I have seen boolean algebra, too.

Sober spaces are not named after a person.  A sober space is a topological
space in which every closed subspace that is not the union of proper closed
subspaces is the closure of exactly one point.  If you are sober then what
you see is really there and you don't see double!

I heard someone give this explanation at a meeting but I don't know its
history.
