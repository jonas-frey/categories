My second book on homological algebra has appeared


     Homological Algebra In Strongly Non-Abelian Settings
     World Scientific
     http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/8608


We propose here a study of =91semiexact=92 and =91homological' =
categories =20
as a basis for a generalised homological algebra. Our aim is to =20
extend the homological notions to deeply non-abelian situations, =20
where satellites and spectral sequences can still be studied.
This is a sequel of a book on =91Homological Algebra, The interplay of =20=

homology with distributive lattices and orthodox semigroups=92, =20
published by the same Editor, but can be read independently of the =20
latter.

The previous book develops homological algebra in p-exact categories, =20=

i.e. exact categories in the sense of Puppe and Mitchell =97 a moderate =20=

generalisation of abelian categories that is nevertheless crucial for =20=

a theory of =91coherence=92 and =91universal models=92 of (even abelian) =
=20
homological algebra. The main motivation of the present, much wider =20
extension is that the exact sequences or spectral sequences produced =20
by unstable homotopy theory cannot be dealt with in the previous =20
framework.

According to the present definitions, a semiexact category is a =20
category equipped with an ideal of =91null=92 morphisms and provided =
with =20
kernels and cokernels with respect to this ideal. A homological =20
category satisfies some further conditions that allow the =20
construction of subquotients and induced morphisms, in particular the =20=

homology of a chain complex or the spectral sequence of an exact couple.

Extending abelian categories, and also the p-exact ones, these =20
notions include the usual domains of homology and homotopy theories, =20
e.g. the category of =91pairs=92 of topological spaces or groups; they =20=

also include their codomains, since the sequences of homotopy =20
=91objects=92 for a pair of pointed spaces or a fibration can be viewed =20=

as exact sequences in a homological category, whose objects are =20
actions of groups on pointed sets.
