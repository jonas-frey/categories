Anent Graham White's suggestions,

Perhaps "liminal" suggests two-facedness to some, but not to Merriam-
Webster ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liminal ), who believ=
e =

it stands for

1: of or relating to a sensory threshold;
2: barely perceptible; or
3: of, relating to, or being an intermediate state, phase, or condition :=

in-between, transitional <in the liminal state between life and death =E2=
=80=94
Deborah Jowitt>. =


And never mind that "two-facedness" in common parlance has to do with
a person's being (not liminal, but) deceitful, insincere, or hypocritical=
=2E

OtOH, liminal does accept prefixes nicely, as: subliminal, supraliminal :=
-) .

As for "bifrontal", often one is faced (sorry :-) ) with an object having=
  =

far more "fronts" than just two. Good old 2 =3D {0, 1}, for example, is: =

a set, a pointed set, a bi-pointed set, a poset, a poset with top, a pose=
t
with bottom, a compact T2 space, a pointed compact T2 space, an abelian g=
roup,
a meet-semilattice, a frame (though others will insist I should be =

saying "locale"), a Boolean Ring, a Boolean Rng, and much much more.

Does the prefix "bi-" really adequately capture the potential of having =

all that many ... umm ... hate to use this term ... personalities?
