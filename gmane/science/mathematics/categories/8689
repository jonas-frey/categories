Cakes, Custard & Category Theory - Culinary approach to maths

LENGTH: 482 words

New Delhi: Cooking can be an answer to simplifying mathematics, says a
new book which tries to whet the appetite of maths whizzes and
arithmophobes alike with recipes and puzzles.


  From simple numeracy to category theory ('the mathematics of
mathematics'), maths crusader Eugenia Cheng prescribes easy recipes for
understanding complex arithmetic in her book "Cake, Custard and Category
Theory".

Calling on a baker's dozen of entertaining, puzzling examples and
mathematically illuminating culinary analogies - including chocolate
brownies, iterated Battenberg cakes, sandwiches, Yorkshire puddings and
Mobius bagels - Cheng tells readers why everyone should love maths.

So what on earth does a recipe have to do with maths? "You might think
that rice cookers are for cooking rice. This is true, but this same
piece of equipment can be used for other things as well: making clotted
cream, cooking vegetables, steaming a chicken. Likewise, maths is about
numbers, but it's about many things as well - getting the right answer,
putting ideas together and so on," she says in the book, published by
Hachette India.

According to Cheng, a senior lecturer in Pure Mathematics at the
University of Sheffield, many people are either afraid of maths, or
baffled by it, or both.

"Or they were completely turned off it by their lessons at school. I
understand this - I was completely turned off sport by my lessons at
school, and have never really recovered. I was so bad at sport at
school, my teachers were incredulous that anybody so bad at sport could
exist. And yet I'm quite fit now, and I have even run the New York
marathon," he writes.

She says 'category theory' which can be thought of as the 'mathematics
of mathematics' is about relationships, contexts, processes, principles,
structures, cakes and custard.

"Yes, even custard. Because mathematics is about drawing analogies
including custard, cake, pie, pastry, doughnuts, bagels, mayonnaise,
yoghurt, lasagne and sushi."

Maths, according to Cheng, like recipes, has both ingredients and
method. "And just as a recipe would be a bit useless if it omitted the
method, we can't understand what maths is unless we talk about the way
it is done, not just the things it studies," she says.

Citing examples of cottage, shepherd and fishermen pies, she says all
these are more or less the same with the only difference being the
filling that is sitting underneath the mashed potato topping. In all
these cases, the recipe is not a full recipe but a blueprint and one can
insert own choice of fruit or meat or fillings.

"This is also how maths works. The idea of maths is to look for
similarities between things so that you only need one 'recipe' for many
different situations. The key is that when you ignore some details, the
situations become easier to understand, and you can fill in the
variables later," she writes.
