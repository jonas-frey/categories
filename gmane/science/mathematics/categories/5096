Dear Jim and all,

This is reply to Jim Stasheff's question below.

I hope it is helpful to relate my own experiences from the 1960s and
later wrt nonabelian cohomology.

In writing my book on topology, I got offended by having to make a
detour to get the fundamental group of the circle,
and then was attracted by Olum's paper
{O}lum, P. \newblock \enquote{Non-abelian cohomology and {van}
{Kampen}'s theorem}.
{Ann. Math.} \textbf{68} (1958) 658--667.
I extended his result to a Mayer-Vietoris (MV) type exact sequence in
``On a method of P. Olum'', {\em J. London Math. Soc.} 40 (1965), 303-304.
and this enabled one to compute the fundamental group of, for example,
a wedge of circles.

( I use an MV sequence in `Topology and groupoids' in connection with
pullbacks of covering spaces.)

So I decided to use this account for the book, thus giving students the
advantage of an introduction to cohomology ideas.

The problem was that the account when written in detail came to 30 pages
(or maybe 40) and when looked at  in the cold light of day seemed
incredibly boring (a full account is different from Olum's research
account).

I was at the time looking for exercises and came across Philip Higgins
paper on presentations of groupoids, which used free products with
amalgamation of groupoids. So I decided to give an exercise on the
fundamental groupoid of a union. Then I felt I ought to write out a
solution.
When I had done this, it seemed streets ahead in exposition of all that
nonabelian cohomology stuff  and moreover, when souped
up to the *fundamental groupoid on a set of base points, *gave results
not reachable by the MV sequence; for example you could not with the MV
sequence deduce the _precise calculation_ of the fundamental group of a
union of two open sets whose intersection had say 150 path components.
(This anomaly
is also significant, in illustrating  the limitations of exact
sequences.) So I decided to switch to an exposition of groupoids in
1-dimensional homotopy theory  (also spurred by a meeting with George
Mackey in 1967 where he told me of his work on ergodic groupoids).

It occurred to me that if one could come to the groupoid idea from two
distinct directions, then there was likely to be
more in this than met the eye.

At the same time, an examination of the proof of the van Kampen theorem
for groupoids, suggested that the theorem should have an extension to
all dimensions,
if one could define homotopy gadgets with the right properties. Another
stimulus was the proof (used in the book) by Frank (circulated in
handwritten lecture notes) of the cellular approximation theorem, which
had analogies to  parts of the van Kampen proof, but failed to get
algebraic results because, apparently, of the lack
of an appropriate algebraic gadget in dimension n>1.

It took 9 years to find such a gadget  in dimension 2, and another 3 to
get them it all dimensions, in work with Philip Higgins.

It seemed to me  unfortunate that this work aroused the opposition, for
reasons never explained to me, of Frank Adams,  who told
people the whole programme was `ridiculous'. His opinion became the
opposite only when I told him (1985?) of the extension
to the non simply connected case of the Blakers-Massey description of
\pi_3 of a triad, using the nonabelian tensor product (work with Loday).

I did make some attempt to get the groupoid van Kampen result from
nonabelian cohomology, see
40.  (with P.R. HEATH and H. KAMPS), ``Groupoids and the Mayer-Vietoris
sequence'', {\em J. Pure Appl. Alg.} 30 (1983)
109-129.
and perhaps the earlier
11.  ``Groupoids as coefficients'', {\em Proc. London Math Soc.} (3) 25
(1972)  413-426.

But the higher order van Kampen theorems, and the often nonabelian
calculations which result,  have not been obtained by cohomological
methods, but only by working directly  with structures appropriate to
the geometry of higher homotopies, i.e. forms of strict multiple
groupoids. This confirms the comment of Philip Hall, Philip Higgins'
supervisor, that one should not try to force the geometry into a given
algebraic mode, but search for the algebra which models the  geometry.
So it seems to me that algebraic topology has  been mainly restricted
to, or not got out of,  the single base point and `group', not
`groupoid', mode, nor appreciated the possibilities of colimit type
theorems in algebraic (and geometric?) topology (no algebraic or
geometric topology text mentions the work with Philip Higgins).

You can also see this restriction in the contrast between the
unsymmetrical, choice laden,  definition of the second relative homotopy
group,
with its compositions in one direction (recall the limitations of
`Lineland' described in `Flatland') and the
definition of the fundamental double groupoid of a pointed pair of
spaces \rho_2(X,A), with its compositions in 2 directions: see
25.  (with P.J. HIGGINS), ``On the connection between the second
relative homotopy groups of some related spaces'', {\em Proc.
London Math.  Soc.} (3) 36 (1978) 193-212.
This contrast gets more significant in higher dimensions.

For all these reasons, my inclination is to look for the applications of
the `appropriate' (whatever that is!) structures rather than
cohomology with coefficients in such structures, where lots of detail is
likely to get lost.

These results could not have been obtained without the intuitions on
multiple compositions easily allowed by a cubical approach.

In any  case, it is useful to analyse successes and failures, in
deciding how to proceed.

Hence my above account of some  failures in nonabelian cohomology! What
if anything have I missed? See also
http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/einst.html

How can one apply these (strict, for my preference!!) multiple groupoids
in other areas???? (recall Grothendieck's work on the fundamental group!!)

Good luck

Ronnie
