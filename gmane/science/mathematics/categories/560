                         APPROACH OF THE SYMPOSIUM

The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics is
the fifth of a biennial series. Our goal is to foster interactions among
mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence.

The meeting includes paper presentation, invited speakers, and special topic
sessions. Topic sessions in the past have covered computational learning
theory, nonmonotonic reasoning, and computational complexity issues in AI.
(Cf., 1996 Symposium.)

The editorial board of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence
serves as the permanent Advisory Committee for the series.
