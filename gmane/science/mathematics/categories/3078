Hmmm, a paper entitled Funcotrial Generic Filters was written
July 2005, abstract to ASL, where you can observe ejecting on=20
initial segments towards models. What it might do on preshaeves
was sent to a conference a month ago. Like I had told the list there=20
were papers I published over several years ago on functors computing models
on Hasse diagrams.=20=20
I'm not in a position to escalate and have to keep you on a holding
as to what it was doing on sheaves. On the surface it appears as if
we are living in parallel worlds getting a message through.=20
