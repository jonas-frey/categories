==========================================================================

GENERAL INFORMATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IFIP TCS2000 is the first International Conference on Theoretical Computer 
Science organized by IFIP TC1 on Foundations of Computer Science, and it 
consists of two tracks: TRACK (1) on Algorithms, Complexity and Models of 
Computation, and TRACK (2) on Logic, Semantics, Specification, and 
Verification. The conference proceedings will be published as a volume
of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag.

IFIP TCS2000 will be held on the campus of Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.
The invited talks and contributed talks will be presented at the Aoba 
Memorial Building and Engineering Conference Hall, Faculty of Engineering 
located on the Aoba Hill about 3 km west of downtown Sendai. The conference
welcome reception and banquet will be held at Sendai Tokyu Hotel, located 
at downtown Sendai.

Please, register and make reservations by returning the completed form 
by email and fax, following the instructions below.
There will also be on-site registration at:
   * Sendai Tokyu Hotel, 15:00 - 20:00, August 16
   * Aoba Memorial Bldg., Tohoku Univ., 9:00 - 17:00 on August 17 - 19.

Transportation

Conference participants arriving at the new Tokyo International (Narita) 
Airport are advised to take the JR Narita Express train from Narita Airport
to Tokyo Station. 
Then, take the Yamabiko super express train of Tohoku Shinkansen (Tohoku 
Bullet Train) to Sendai from Tokyo Station. The Yamabiko runs every 20 - 30
min. and takes about 2 hours from Tokyo to Sendai. Making reservation at 
Narita Station for the Yamabiko is recommended, since it will be the summer
tourist season. 
Those arriving at the new Osaka International Airport (Kansai Airport) can
fly to Sendai Airport, and take Limousine Bus service to Sendai Station. 
The bus takes about 30 min. to go from the Airport to Sendai Station. You 
can also take a shuttle bus service from Kansai Airport to the Osaka-Itami 
Airport to fly from there to Sendai Airport. Alternatively, you can take a 
local train from the Kansai Airport to JR Shin Osaka Station, then take the
Tokaido Shinkansen from Osaka to Tokyo Station and change at Tokyo Station 
to Tohoku Shinkansen. 
Some details on transportation will be available on the TCS2000 Web page, at
        http://tcs2000.ito.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/tcs2000/
Note: 
(1) In Japan, mid-August is the busiest tourist time during summer, 
    including domestic and international flights. 
(2) No flight service is available from Narita to Sendai Airport, since the
    train service is convenient. There is another train service from Narita
    Airport to downtown Tokyo (Ueno) by Skyliner of the Keisei-Narita Line.
    At Ueno you can take the Yamabiko super express of Tohoku Shinkansen to
    Sendai, but you have to walk about 10 min. from Keisei-Ueno Station to 
    JR Ueno Station to take Tohoku Shinkansen.
(3) If you are going to travel in Japan by JR lines before/after the IFIP 
    TCS2000 conference, it will be convenient and economical to get a JR 
    PASS before your departure. Contact your travel agent for more 
    information on JR PASS (Japan Rail Pass).

Hotels

Two hotels are arranged to offer special discount rates to IFIP TCS2000 
participants: Sendai Tokyu Hotel and Sendai Washington Hotel. They are 
1.2 km west of Sendai Station and about 800 Yen by taxi from the station. 
These hotels are located within 5 min. walk from each other. The conference
welcome reception and banquet will be held at Sendai Tokyu Hotel.

Sendai and Climate

Sendai is the largest city in the northern part of the Honshu Island of 
Japan, with a population of about a million. The City is known in Japan 
as "City of Trees". Sendai is a modern, safe city with a temperate climate 
blessed by four distinct seasons; even in mid August it is quite seldom 
that the highest temperature exceeds 30 C (86 F). 
Usually, the weather in mid August would be mostly sunny with temperatures
ranging from 20 C (68 F) to 30 C (86 F), and rain, if any, would rarely be
heavy.
Note: Average temperatures in August at Sendai, Tokyo and Osaka are about 
      23.5 C, 26.5 C and 27.5, respectively.
