That is a nice point. In consequence, so far as I know, no one is
interested in `mixed strategies' for games in set theory or
semantics.  There is no sense to the `average/expected payoff' for a
randomized strategy as there is no payoff.  Mixed strategies are the focus
of most economic and such uses of game theory.  The usual question is how
to find optimal mixed strategies when there is no winning one.

The usual question for games in set theory or semantics is just whether one
player has a winning strategy.  That is the only question in the uses I
know of.
