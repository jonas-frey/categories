That's my alternative to St. Augustine's proof of the existence of god,
with "clean-shaven" thrown in to draw attention away from the real
fallacy (one would no more portray God without a beard than Santa Claus).

What I don't understand is why the emphasis on existence to the
exclusion of uniqueness, given that monotheism is the intellectual
descendant not of atheism but polytheism.  The only explanation I've
been able to come up with is that uniqueness is an equational property
(g = g') and therefore admissible as an axiom, say as part of the
definition of god.  Postulating existence in a definition is an obvious
cheat since the definition might be inconsistent.  A minimal requirement
for an existence proof is a consistency proof, which are tough to begin
with and get increasingly tougher with increasing scientific understanding.

Even simpler: P(a) --> (exists) x. P(x) is a theorem of the pure
predicate calculus, which is "clearly" false in the empty universe when
P is taken to be the identically true predicate.

If you use cylindric algebras B as the subalgebras of the Boolean
algebra 2^D^V of all V-ary relations on a domain D, there is nothing to
fix.   Given a first order language L of wffs over a set X of variables,
for each subset V of X, let L_V denote those wffs of L using variables
from V, and for each D and each B as above let I_B: L_V --> B interpret
the wffs of L_V in B subject only to requirement T0 below.  Define the
theory T(L) to consist of those wffs P of L such that every I_B having P
in its domain map P to the top element of B.  Requirement T0 is that the
intersection of T(L) and L_0 consist of the propositional tautologies.

(Every reasonable notion of classical pure predicate calculus must
surely satisfy these extremely mild conditions, which shouldn't be too
hard to phrase appropriately for intuitionist logic as well.)

Claim.  T(L) is independent of whether D = 0 is forbidden.

Proof.  Allowing D = 0 can only decrease T(L).  There are two cases.

1.  V > 0.  In this case D^V = 0 whence B has only one element and so
I_B maps *every* wff to the top element of B.  This cannot decrease T(L).

2.  V = 0.  This is propositional calculus, for which requirement T0
makes the choice of D irrelevant.  QED

I noticed this property of cylindric algebras when I first ran across
them in mid-1979 and assumed it must be well-known since Tarski and
Henkin had been playing around with them since the 1950s and could
hardly have overlooked such an elementary fact.  A month later I
attended the sixth International Congress of Logic, Methodology, and
Philosophy of Science in Hannover where I met a number of algebraic
logicians for the first time: Routley, Dunn, Nemeti, Andreka, Maksimova,
etc.  When Nemeti and Andreka told me they were working with Henkin,
Monk and Tarski on Vol. 2 of Cylindric Algebras, I asked them if they
were aware that cylindric algebra semantics solved the
logic-of-the-empty-universe problem.  They said no so I showed them the
argument.  Since they were much better connected to the cylindric
community than I, I figured they'd pass it on, relieving me of any
obligation to write up what seemed to me little more than a passing
remark.  I was hoping it might appear in Vol. 2 but I don't see it there.
