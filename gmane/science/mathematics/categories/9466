Dear All,

Thanks once again for the responses---I appreciate it!

@Cory. Thanks! This was helpful to see that the two perspectives
respond to different `needs' within mathematics, and that for many
applications the algebraic perspective suffices.

I did just want to pick up on the point about large cardinals. I
suspect that those sorts of `arithmetical definability'
characterisations will only work for cardinals you can characterise
from below (i.e. by stating that there's a fixed point for some sort
of describability property) and thus are likely to be consistent with
V=3DL. However, there are really interesting categorial
characterisations of *very* strong large cardinals, some of them
dating back to the 1960s (see Brooke-Taylor and Bagaria, `On Colimits
and Elementary Embeddings'). But I'm not really on top of this
material, so don't have a feel for how the proof works yet (other than
that the embeddability in the category-theoretic setting somehow
transfers to the existence of large cardinal embeddings in set
theory).

@Mike. Thanks for the points about the meta-theory---all clear to me
now. Similarly for ordinals.

I was talking about the etale space. My claim wasn't meant to be that
it *couldn't* be done structurally, just that sometimes the
set-theoretic perspective is useful for seeing what's going on in a
particular construction (but maybe this is just a holdover of how I
first came across sheaves---then there was a lot of quotienting in
material set theory).

You're right of course about the large cardinals (as I mentioned to
Cory). This strikes me as very interesting stuff that I'm just not on
top of yet. The example of L is also super-nice...thanks! I will have
a think about this.

@Patrik: I'm also unsure how category theory is not a `theory'.
Obviously were interested in many and varied categories but the core
axiomatisation of what a category is is still first-order. Similarly
in material set theory, even though ZFC is the `core' set theory (for
many people anyway) we still consider lots of different theories. So I
don't see how the phrase `is category theory a theory? I think not.'
wouldn't apply mutatis mutandis to material set theory.

I *do* think however there's an important philosophical difference:
Set theory aims at an intended interpretation (the cumulative
hierarchy), whereas category theory doesn't (the whole *point* of it
is to apply across diverse contexts). But maybe things are more subtle
than I realise [plus I'm maybe straying into off-list philosophical
territory with this claim].

Best Wishes,

Neil
