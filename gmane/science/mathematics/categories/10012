============================================
Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
PhD position in Theoretical Computer Science
============================================


We are seeking applications for a fully-funded, 4-year PhD position in
the Section of Theoretical Computer Science of the Vrije Universiteit
Amsterdam (VUA). The goal of the project is the development of
techniques for reasoning about automata that transform finite and
infinite words (also known as transducers). For more details about the
project, please check out http://joerg.endrullis.de/vidi/vidi.pdf, and
http://joerg.endrullis.de/research/finite-state-transducers. In this
project, we will use and extend techniques from automata theory,
combinatorics on words, logic, coalgebra and term rewriting.

Embedding
---------

The principal investigator of this project is Joerg Endrullis with a
background in term rewriting and automata theory. We will collaborate
with Helle Hansen from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) having
expertise in logic and coalgebra. At the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam we
will collaborate with Femke van Raamsdonk with a background in
higher-order rewriting, and Jasmin Blanchette working on formal
verification and theorem provers.

Qualifications
--------------

Applicants should have a masters degree in computer science,
mathematics, logic, or a closely related area. Knowledge of automata
theory, coalgebra, logic, term rewriting or lambda calculus is
considered an advantage. Fluency in English is important. Dutch language
proficiency is not required.


Application
-----------

Please send applications by email to

  ??dr. Joerg Endrullis
  ??j.endrullis@vu.nl
  ??+31 (0)20 5989886

For more details on the salary and employment conditions, see the full
vacancy text at
http://joerg.endrullis.de/vacancy/2019/09/15/phd-vacancy.html. Feel free
to contact us for further information about the project and the position.

Formal applications must include:

- A motivation letter
- A curriculum vitae, including?? a list of courses with grades
- A copy of the master's thesis (if already available)
- The name of at least one scientist able and willing to provide a reference

Deadline
--------

Review of applications will begin on December 1, 2019, and will continue
until the position is filled.
