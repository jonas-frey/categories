Perhaps, a better and more exciting model for the youngster=20
is Richard Feynman, a "genious" with common sense:

It's also not true that George Cantor committed suicide!

And I would not call Ludwig Boltzmann a mathematician.  I'd call him a
physicist.

But the documentary seems a bit more accurate than this summary.
