i think david yetter's analysis of the dichotomy "categories as =20
foundations" vs "categories as algebra" was spot on ---  with respect =20=

to people and the community. indeed, one could split most of our =20
papers into one category or the other.

but at the end of the day, i think, we'll all agree that the source =20
of the unreasonable effectiveness of categorical algebra is its =20
foundational content (although there is probably a lot of it that we =20
dont understand yet); and the other way around. eg, if you look at =20
grothendieck's work, he started working in algebra, and ended up =20
developing foundational structures, because he needed them. and a lot =20=

on the "algebra" side now is built upon them. ok, then for a while it =20=

was thought that he exaggerated with foundations, and that a more =20
direct approach "could have been in better taste" (to cite =20
eilenberg). but maby the fermat theorem would have a more useful =20
proof if it was developed in grothendieck style. and nowadays, there =20
is a lot of foundational content in tannaka duality etc, in TQFT in =20
general, but we only see hints of it at the moment (and i for one =20
just see the reflections of these hints in other people's eyes).

i am of course saying things very clear and familiar to many people =20
on this list, but maby they are worth saying nevertheless. it might =20
be good if the links between "categories as algebras" and "categories =20=

as foundations" would not boil down just to the greatest of the =20
category theorists, leaving the rest of us in two camps.
