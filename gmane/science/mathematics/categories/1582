I agree with Mike Barr. I think there is a specific reason for using
blackboards in math talks: Where most disciplines use graphics and texts to
present data and conclusions, mathematicians often write to convey a line
of reasoning as it develops. When I talk about math I often put formulas or
diagrams on the board, and change them as I go. 

Slides and powerpoint can handle those changes in various ways, but none
are as flexible or as graceful as writing on a board.
