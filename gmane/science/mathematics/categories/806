The number of submissions to xxx.lanl.gov seems more driven by culture
than anything else.  The following are the number of submissions for
1998 to date:

	Astrophysics: 		2225
	Condensed Matter	2272
	  + 10 more physics areas
	Mathematics (total)	932
	Computation & Language	48

Evidently very few computer scientists think to submit to xxx.lanl.gov.
I wouldn't infer from those numbers that computer science is not
flourishing or publishing.

As far as algebraic geometry vs category theory goes, the most recent
5 submissions in those respective areas span 1 week vs. 11 weeks,
suggesting that the recent rate of submissions is closer to 11:1 than
221:1.  (I'd have taken a larger sample if one had been as handy as the
most-recent-5 statistic.)
