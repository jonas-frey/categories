Electronic Information

   * The conference home page is found at http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fmoods2000
   * Conference-related email should be addressed to
     fmoods2000@cs.stanford.edu
   * Information on the FMOODS series of conferences can be found at

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Call for Posters

The poster session will provide an opportunity for attendees to learn about
innovative work in progress and to preview late-breaking research results.

Submission instructions:
Researchers interested in presenting a poster should prepare an overview of
their proposed poster in the form of text or postscript file of no more than
1000 words in length. Send the poster title, and the names and affiliations
of its authors (including email address), along with the overview (as text
in the body of the email, or as an attachment), to:
fmoods2000@steam.stanford.edu. Research students working on FMOODS relevant
topics are encouraged to participate in the poster session.

Deadlines:
Poster abstract submission: August 15, 2000
Poster acceptance nofication: within 7-10 days after submission is received.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Call for Demos

FMOODS 2000 will include a session of software demonstrations. Submission
instructions are identical to the poster submission mechanism above. All
equipment should be provided by you (bring a laptop); we will provide an
internet connection as well as a large display for PC-compatible computers.
Demonstrations related to papers appearing at the conference are particuarly
encouraged.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Student Grants

We have applied for funding to provide some student grants for attending
FMOODS. If you are a student and are in need of a grant to support travel
expenses send an inquiry to fmoods2000@cs.stanford.edu including your name,
institution, status, and research interests (one or two lines). Priority
will be given to students presenting posters.

Objectives

Object-based Distributed Computing is being established as the most
pertinent basis for the support of large, heterogeneous computing and
telecommunications systems. Indeed, several important international
organisations, such as ITU, ISO, OMG, TINA-C, etc. are defining similar
distributed object-based frameworks as a foundation for open distributed
computing.

The advent of Open Object-based Distributed Systems - OODS - brings new
challenges and opportunities for the use and development of formal methods.
New architectures and system models are emerging (e.g., the enterprise,
information, computational and engineering viewpoints of the ITU-T/ISO/IEC
ODP Reference Model) which require formal notational support. Usual design
issues such as specification, verification, refinement, and testing need to
take into account new dimensions introduced by distribution and openness,
such as quality of service and dependability constraints, dynamic binding
and reconfiguration, consistency between multiple models and viewpoints,
etc. OODS is a challenging research context and a source of motivation for
semantical models of object-based systems and notations, for the evolution
of standardised formal description techniques, for the application and
assessment of logic based approaches, for better understanding and
information modeling of business requirements, and for the further
development and use of Object Oriented methodologies and tools.

The objective of FMOODS is to provide an integrated forum for the
presentation of research in several related fields, and the exchange of
ideas and experiences in the topics concerned with the formal methods
support for Open Object-based Distributed Systems.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

   * formal models for object-based distributed computing
   * semantics of object-based distributed systems and programming languages
   * formal techniques in object-based and object-oriented specification,
     analysis and design
   * refinement and transformation of specifications
   * types, service types and subtyping
   * interoperability and composability of distributed services
   * object-based coordination languages
   * object-based mobile languages
   * efficient analysis techniques of specifications
   * multiple viewpoint modelling and consistency between different models
   * formal techniques in distributed systems verification and testing
   * specification, verification and testing of quality of service
     constraints
   * formal methods and object life cycle
   * beyond IDL: semantics based specification patterns
   * formal models for measuring the quality of object-oriented requirement
     or design specifications
   * formal aspects of distributed real-time multimedia systems
   * applications to telecommunications and related areas
