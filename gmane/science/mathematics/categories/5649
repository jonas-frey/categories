Yes, exactly; however, if one wishes this notion of product
to become a special case of the notion of limit (a demand
which seems not unreasonable) then it is enough to ask your
type theory to have identity types: for then any preset A can
be made into a category A# whose hom-setoids are the identity
types Id_A(x,y) equipped with their propositional equality.
Now limits indexed by A# correspond with products indexed
by A, and so in this setting we recover the theorem that all
limits <---> products and equalisers.
