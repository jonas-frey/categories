Dear friends and colleagues,=0A=
=0A=
In Spring 1981, near a lavender field in Southern France,=0A=
Alexander Grothendieck greeted me at the door of his home.=0A=
He wasted no time and immediately put the question:=0A=
=0A=
'What is the relationship between the two uses of the term 'topos'?'=0A=
=0A=
This led to a very interesting discussion.The first thing that=0A=
was established as a basis was that SGA4 never defined 'topos',=0A=
but rather spoke always of 'U-topos',  where U was a certain=0A=
kind of model of set theory. All the categories so arising have=0A=
common features, such as cartesian closure, and the U itself can=0A=
be construed as such a category. (TAC Reprints no. 11).=0A=
=0A=
Thus we arrived at the notion of 'U-topos' as a special geometric=0A=
morphism E =1B$B"*=1B(BU  of 'elementary' toposes. Grothendieck's=0A=
general method of relativization suggests the usefulness=0A=
of a general topos as a codomain or base U. (see Giraud, SLN 274).=0A=
But to focus more specifically on the original case, various special=0A=
properties of the base U could also be considered:=0A=
Booleanness (note for example, that Booleanness distinguishes=0A=
algebraic points among algebraic figures)=0A=
Axiom of choice;=0A=
Lack of measurable cardinals; et cetera.=0A=
=0A=
One of the many topics we discussed was the=0A=
'Medaille de Chocolat' exercise in SGA4, and its basic importance=0A=
for understanding applications of topos theory: the gros and=0A=
petit sheaves of an object point out that there should be a=0A=
qualitative distinction between a topos of SPACES and a topos=0A=
of set-valued sheaves on a generalized space. I believe that=0A=
considerable progress is now being made on the characterization=0A=
of 'gros' toposes under the name of Cohesion. Grothendieck made=0A=
a big step towards  the characterization of 'petit' under the name=0A=
of  'etendu'  (sometimes known as 'locally localic'). Concerning=0A=
Grothendieck's most famous contribution, the 'petit etale' topos,=0A=
what are it's distinguishing properties as a topos?=0A=
=0A=
We also discussed the Grauert direct image theorem as a=0A=
relativization of the Cartan-Serre theorem. It is important to=0A=
note that Grothendieck's work was not limited to the Weil=0A=
conjectures but, for example, involved around 1960 several=0A=
categories related to complex analysis which were perhaps=0A=
part of his inspiration for the notion of topos.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
Separation?=0A=
Actually, separation has been one of the main sources of confusion.=0A=
I wish that someone with internet confidence would correct the=0A=
Wikipedia article that claims that pre-1970 toposes were about=0A=
geometry, but that post-1970 toposes were about logic. Certainly,=0A=
that discourages students from studying either.=0A=
Omitted was the fact that logic has always been used to sharpen the=0A=
study of geometry; in the last 50 years we have been able to make=0A=
this relation more explicit, with the help of categories.=0A=
=0A=
Of course, separating a certain kind of object from a certain kind=0A=
of map would be basic 'grammar'.=0A=
But we cannot separate the legacy of Grothendieck from the=0A=
inspiration it gives to the continuing development of topos theory.=0A=
=0A=
Best wishes=0A=
