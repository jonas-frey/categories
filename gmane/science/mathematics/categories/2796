[FLOPS benefits from an eclectic mix of FP and LP papers, one of the few
venues where the two communities get together.   It should be a
congenial meeting, situated under Mt Fuji.  Do come!   -- P]

                            First Call For Papers

   Eighth International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming
                                FLOPS 2006

                               April 24--26
                            Fuji Susono, JAPAN

                      Submission deadline: November 11
                  http://hagi.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/FLOPS2006

FLOPS is a forum for research on all issues concerning declarative
programming, including functional programming and logic programming,
and aims to promote cross-fertilization between the two paradigms.
Previous FLOPS meetings were held in Fuji Susono (1995), Shonan
Village (1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999), Tokyo (2001), Aizu
(2002), and Nara (2004).

TOPICS

FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of functional and logic
programming, including (but not limited to):

     Declarative Pearls: new and excellent declarative programs with
     illustrative applications;

     Language issues: language design and constructs, programming
     methodology, integration of paradigms, interfacing with other
     languages, type systems, constraints, concurrency and distributed
     computing;

     Foundations: logic and semantics, rewrite systems and narrowing,
     type theory, proof systems;

     Implementation issues: compilation techniques, memory management,
     program analysis and transformation, partial evaluation,
     parallelism;

     Applications: case studies, real-world applications, graphical user
     interfaces, internet applications, XML, databases, formal methods,
     and model checking.

For 2006, we wish to particularly encourage papers on new application
areas, including security, bioinformatics, and quantum computation.

The proceedings will be published as a LNCS volume.  The proceedings
of the previous meeting (FLOPS2004) were published as LNCS2998.

SUBMISSION

Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshops proceedings may be submitted. Submissions should
fall into one of the following categories:

Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will be
judged on originality, correctness and significance.

System descriptions: they should contain a link to a working system
and will be judged on originality, usefulness and design.

All submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15
proceedings pages long. Authors are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX2e
and the Springer llncs class file, available at
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

Regular research papers should be supported by proofs and/or
experimental results.  In case of lack of space, this supporting
information should be made accessible otherwise (e.g. a link to a web
page, or an appendix).

Submission is Web-based and under preparation.  Please visit
