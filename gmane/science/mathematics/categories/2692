Professorships, Readerships, Lectureships, Tutorships.
======================================================
The department of computer science at Swansea (Wales, UK) is
currently advertising academic positions at all levels.
We hope expecially to expand our groups in visual
computing and in logic/theoretical computer
science.

Our department was rated 5 in the last research assessment exericse.
It has a strong group in logic and
theoretical computer science which is amongst the biggest in
UK. The members of that group are Ulrich Berger (proof theory,
computability theory, type theory),  Phil Grant (artificial
intelligence), Andy Gimblett (algebraic specification),
Neal Harman (hardware verification, models of computation,
algebraic specification), Oliver Kullmann (satisfiability problems),
Markus Michelbrink (category theory, proof theory, type theory),
Faron Moller (automata theory, modal and temporal logic),
Markus Roggenbach (algebraic specification), Monika Seisenberger
(proof theory, type theory, computability theory),
Anton Setzer (proof theory, type theory) and
John Tucker (algebraic specification, algebraic methods,
computability theory). We have as well strong links to the
mathematics department, with Roger Hindley (lambda-calculus) and
Jiang-Lun Wu (nonstandard analysis).

The deadline for application is 25 June 2004 (I have been
signalled that late applications might still be acceptable).
The official advertisements can be found at
