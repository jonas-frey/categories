Dear all,

We are pleased to announce the School and Workshop on Univalent
Mathematics to be held at the University of Birmingham (UK), December
11-15, 2017.


Overview
----------

Univalent Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies
a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type
theory. This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of
Univalent Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics,
based on ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.

The UniMath library is a large repository of computer-checked
mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. The workshop will
give many young researchers an opportunity to familiarize themselves
with the UniMath library and become contributors.


Format
----------

During the school/workshop, the participants will be working either
individually or in small groups, mentored by experienced UniMath
developers. The problems will be designed to be of practical
importance in the development of the UniMath library as well as of
pedagogical value to participants.


Application and funding
----------

For information on how to participate, please visit
https://unimath.github.io/bham2017/.
The deadline to apply is October 15, 2017.
Financial support is available to cover participants' travel and
lodging expenses.
