Sheer coincidence? Or intentionally planned spyware installation?

A few moments ago I accepted the (seemingly kind) offer of
World Scientific / Imperial College Press to download sample
pages of their attractive-sounding new physics publication
"More and Different" by Princeton University Physicist Emeritus =

Philip W. Anderson.

As the PDF for the free sample Chapter 1 was downloading, my
installation of Microsoft Security Essentials popped up with a
warning that some "potentially unwanted adware" had just found =

its way onto my machine, in the form of files =


\DLeasy.net-AVM-ref202085\AVMconverter.exe [->(UPX)] and
\DLeasy.net-AVM-ref202085\AVMconverter-bis.exe [->(UPX)]

that serve to install the Adware:Win32/Hotbar (which, selon

http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?n=
ame=3DAdware%3aWin32%2fHotbar&threatid=3D6204
,

"installs a browser toolbar that works in Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8 and
Firefox 3.6 and 4.0 ... is a multi-component adware program designed to
monitor user's online browsing behavior to deliver targeted advertising .=
=2E.
also installs other adware components related to Win32/ClickPotato and
Win32/ShopperReports ... [and more]").

As it happens, I'm still on FF 3.6.28, hence vulnerable to this.

Needless to say, I let MSE quarantine it :-) . =


Cheers, and don't get bit by this, =
