Hi Michael,

Video-taping certainly is out, if it ever was in. Taping is
non-interactive and just silly. Your attitude towards "Hi-tech
whiteboards" sounds too hi-tech as my point indeed was to say what you
say about your favourite medium. That is still also my favourite medium,
but I accept to write or meet virtually in particular if my audience is a
flight distance away. Something is lost when you go virtual, but you also
win some.

Do you resist virtual whiteboards per se, or would you be interested in
trying out a session? Installation is less than 15 minutes, and once we
are online, we could spend another 15 discussing idempotent functors
extendable to monads where E-M and Kleisli coincide. The mouse is your
chalk and your board colour is white.

I've used it so much already over the last years so I cannot work without
it anymore. I can supervise a student from my home or a hotel room in
Tokyo, and nobody knows or even cares who's where.

Cheers,

Patrik

Dear Michael,

No comment (at this point) on content, but let me refer to a previous mail
I sent out on the subject and related to execution.

My idea was to suggest a setup of virtual classrooms so that students and
teacher indeed all over the world can attend a class. Of course, students
and teacher, and in the end content, must be carefully selected.

The reason for my suggestion is that the number of students at many sites
is usually bery low for these courses and we should join forces.

My suggestion is to use "sound-video-whiteboard" techniques as provided
e.g. by Adobe and Marratech. I use the latter.

"Sound-video" is nothing but Skype, but adding whiteboards, that can be
saved and worked with also offline, you have very good possibilities.
The whiteboard mainly accepts non-formatted text, drawings and images. You
can read doc and ppt file which are "pasted" as bitmaps on the whiteboard.
They include desktop sharing if that would be required. Mathematical text
I add through LaTeX, compiling, converting to pdf, and using the snapshot
tool to paste bitmapped formulas on the whiteboard.

Once you get used to it you are actually not (much) slower on the virtual
whiteboard as compared to a real whiteboard. Virtual advantages are e.g.

         - several whiteboards and easy to switch between them
         - more than one can jointly add to whitebooard content
         - can save and open (as mentioned)
         - can prepare whiteboards offline (as mentioned)

If this is inline with your thoughts and you would like to try out
Marratech, let me know.

Best,

Patrik
