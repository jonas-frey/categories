In "Towards a categorical foundation of mathematics" (Logic Colloquium
'95, ed's: J. A. Makowsky and E. V. Ravve, Springer Lecture Notes in Logic
no.11, 1998; pp.153-190) and in subsequent work, I am proposing an
approach to a foundation whose universe consists of the weak n-categories
and whatever things are needed to connect them. This is done on the basis
of a general point of view concerning the role of identity of mathematical
objects. Readers of said paper who have followed developments on weak
higher dimensional categories will note that much has been done since
towards fleshing out the program.
