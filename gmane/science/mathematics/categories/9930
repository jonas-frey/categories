About a month ago, I inquired whether any of you had a copy of a preprint b=
y that name from 1979.  Then I found a copy and offered to send a scan of i=
t to anyone who asked and I sent out maybe 8 or 10 of them.  To most of the=
  recipients I noted that in looking at the paper, there were serious proble=
ms.  Now, aided by John Kennison and Bob Raphael, we have written a new pap=
er, deciphering and thoroughly revising the old one.  I invite anyone who i=
s interested to download it from www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/<http://www.math.m=
cgill.ca/barr/>.  All the papers I ever wrote are found there too.
