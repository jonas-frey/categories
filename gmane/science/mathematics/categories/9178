EATCS Bulletin, http://eatcs.org/index.php/eatcs-bulletin, has a
section for "Technical contributions."  To stimulate this section
further, we will be considering for publication abstracts of works
that have been accepted by journals and/or conferences or have
appeared in major archives.  The topics of interest include all areas
of theoretical computer science (for instance, see topics of the three
Tracks of ICALP, http://www.easyconferences.eu/icalp2016/cfp.html).

Abstracts should be rather detailed, 2-3 pages long in the format
given at http://eatcs.org/index.php/eatcs-bulletin.  Submissions
should include the information on the full paper (the name of
conferences, archives, etc) and sufficiently detailed explanation of
its merits, e.g., importance, motivations, clear comparison with
existing results and novelty and/or new ideas of proof techniques.

The Bulletin is published in Feb, Jun and Oct.  The deadline for the
abstract submission is 20th of the previous month, for instance, May
20 (Sat) 2017 for the June issue of this year. All materials including
tex and pdf files should be sent electrically to bulletin@eatcs.org
and iwama@kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp.  Acceptance/rejection, decided based on
its merit mentioned above, will be notified as soon as possible.  The
Bulletin will not require copy-right transfer for accepted abstracts.
