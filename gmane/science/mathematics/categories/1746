There was some discussion of this point on the categories mailing list
a year or two back. I think there was general consensus that the "co"
in "cofinal" was redundant, and that such functors should simply be
called "final". This is the term used in Mac Lane's book (section IX 3,
p.217) -- I believe Mac Lane was the first to shorten "cofinal" to "final".
For some reason, Borceux chose to use the opposite convention regarding
"initial" and "final" in his book (although, in Exercise 2.17.8 on page 94,
he seems to have reverted to the same convention as Mac Lane).
