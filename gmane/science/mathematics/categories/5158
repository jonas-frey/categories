Dear Urs,

There are various directed topological structures, which have =20
directed homotopies
and fundamental (higher) categories, like:

- preordered topological spaces (simple but poor);
- locally preordered topological spaces (in a suitable sense);
- d-spaces =3D topological spaces equipped with distinguished paths;
- spaces equipped with distinguished cubes;
- cubical sets (in the combinatorial world);
- generalised metric spaces (in the sense of Lawvere);
- 'inequilogical spaces';
- etc.

I prefer d-spaces, which have also been studied by other authors. =20
(Notice that the one-dimensional
information which is added to a topological space has effects in all =20
dimension.) However,
directed homology works much better for cubical sets, or spaces with =20
distinguished cubes.

In my web page you can find references to many papers of mine on this =20=

domain, and such
papers have many references to other authors. You could begin by:

- M. Grandis, Directed homotopy theory, I. The fundamental category, =20
Cah. Topol. G=E9om. Diff=E9r. Cat=E9g. 44 (2003), 281-316.

-, The shape of a category up to directed homotopy, Theory Appl. =20
Categ. 15 (2005/06), No. 4, 95-146.


A more complete study can be found in my book.
The latter does not cover higher fundamental categories, which - in =20
dimension 2 - can be found
in:

-, Modelling fundamental 2-categories for directed homotopy, Homology =20=

Homotopy Appl. 8 (2006), 31-70.


-, Lax 2-categories and directed homotopy, Cah. Topol. G=E9om. Diff=E9r. =
=20
Cat=E9g. 47 (2006), 107-128.

-, Absolute lax 2-categories, Appl. Categ. Struct. 14 (2006), 191-214.
