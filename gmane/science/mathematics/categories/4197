Hello, here is an answer to Paul's question: The data (F,beta)
defines a (lax?) functor between "monoidal categories with right
units but not left units" [henceforth MR-categories].

Every pointed category can be considered as an MR-category, in fact a
strict one. The tensor product is left projection. The right unit is
the point of the category (although every object of the category
behaves like a right unit for this category.)

In particular, the category S in Paul's email, with point F(1), can
be seen as an MR-category. Of course, every monoidal category,
including M, is an MR-category too.

The data for a lax MR-functor M->S consists of a functor F:M->S, a
morphism F(i)->F(i), which we can take as identity, and a natural
transformation
    F(p)*F(a) --> F(p*a)
which in this case amounts to a map
    beta:F(p) --> F(p*a)

A monoidal functor must satisfy three coherence conditions,
for associativity, left identity and right identity.
For an MR-functor, there are only axioms for associativity and right
identity, and these are exactly the axioms that Paul gave.

Hope that makes sense! All the best, Sam.
