Dear Bill,

The history of simplicial terms is certainly complicated and often
contradictory.
Presently, the term of 'simplicial set/object' seems to be generally
accepted (for a presheaf on positive finite ordinals) and this notion
seems to be mostly considered as the leading one in its framework.
My modest opinion is that simplicial terminology should be organised
taking this term as the leading one.

Fine, I agree, I should replace 'opposition' with 'distinction'.
Certainly, I would not speak of opposition for the relationships
     set / preordered set
     space / directed space
     classical algebraic topology / directed algebraic topology.

Your comments on distributive lattices are most interesting.

Best wishes    Marco
