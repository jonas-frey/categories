Dear Neil,

Some comments below.

All the best,

Steve.

Yes, I think I would claim that the foundational work should be in the
language of categories. Much of the justification for that is pragmatic
methodology, in that category theory has proved itself effective in
elucidating the underlying mathematics common to different foundations.

I have been hugely influenced in this by my experience of relating
topology to logic, and point-set approaches to point-free. It is
category theory that shows us how point-set and point-free are doing
similar things, using structure shared by the categories of topological
spaces and of point-free spaces such as locales. And we don't have to go
far down this road before the comparison starts to show point-set
topology in an unfavourable light.

A similar example of the categorical analysis of foundations is
Grothendieck's discovery of toposes. (This is my rational
reconstruction, so apologies - to you and to Grothendieck - if it's
bollocks historically.) Grothendieck asked what mathematics was needed
to do sheaf cohomology, known from sheaves over topological spaces, and
gave an answer using categorical structure. Abstracting that gave us
Grothendieck toposes, thus generalized spaces in the sense that you can
still do sheaf cohomology over them.

The methodology is not entirely pragmatic, however. Categorical
structure explicitly describes how objects relate to each other (via
morphisms) as opposed to how they are structured internally. The real
mathematics lies in those mutual relationships. Any foundational
discussion that says the mathematics _is_ the structures - the sets or
whatever - is answering the wrong questions. Those structures are just
particular solutions to the mathematical problem. It is the same as the
difference between the API of a software library (how the calling
program relates to the library routines it calls) and the implementation
of the library routines - which is best left hidden and subject to revision.

Cardinality is in fact what I had in mind when I asked the question. It
is one of those notions that tends to fade away when category theory
takes you from one foundational setting to another, say from classical
maths to constructive, or from point-set topology to point-free.

  From one point of view ("making set theory more categorical") you would
be interested in finding a categorical description that can still deal
with cardinalities. From the other ("exposing possible limitations") you
would use the categories as reason for losing interest in cardinalities.
