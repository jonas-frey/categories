			   CALL FOR PAPERS

			        MFPS XXIV
	    http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps24.htm

		   Twenty-fourth Conference on the
		     Mathematical Foundations of
			Programming Semantics

		      University of Pennsylvania
			 Philadelphia, PA USA
                           May 22 - 25, 2008

	  Partially Supported by US Office of Naval Research


The MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic,
and computer science which are related to models of computation, in
general, and to the semantics of programming languages, in particular.
The series has particularly stressed providing a forum where
researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and exchange
ideas about problems of common interest. As the series also strives to
maintain breadth in its scope, the conference strongly encourages
participation by researchers in neighboring areas.

TOPICS include, but are not limited to, the following: biocomputation;
categorical models; concurrent and distributed computation;
constructive mathematics; domain theory; formal languages; formal
methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; logic; non-classical
computation; probabilistic systems; process calculi; program analysis;
programming-language theory; quantum computation; rewriting theory;
security; specifications; topological models; type systems; type
theory.

The Twenty-fourth Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics (MFPS XXIV) will take place on the campus of
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA USA from Thursday, May 22
through Sunday, May 25, 2008.

The Organising Committee for MFPS consists of Stephen Brookes (CMU),
Achim Jung (Birmingham), Catherine Meadows (NRL), Michael Mislove
(Tulane), and Prakash Panangaden (McGill). The local arrangements for
MFPS XXIV are being overseen by Andre Scedrov (Penn).

The INVITED SPEAKERS for MFPS XXIV are

   Samson Abramsky, Oxford
   Luca Cardelli, Microsoft Research, Cambridge
   Dusko Pavlovic, Kestrel Institute
   Benjamin Pierce, Penn
   Phil Scott, Ottawa
   James Worrell, Oxford

In addition, there will be four special sessions:
- A session honoring Phil Scott on the occasion of his 60th birthday
year, which is being organized by Rick Blute (Ottawa) and Andre
Scedrov (Penn).

- A session on Systems Biology will be held in conjunction with Luca
Cardelli's plenaary talk. It is being organized by Jean Krivine (LIX).

- A third session will be devoted to Type Theory. It is being
organized by Benjamin Pierce and by Robert Harper (CMU) will be held
in conjunction with Benjamin Pierce's plenary talk.

- The fourth special session will be on Security, and will be
organized by Catherine Meadows (NRL) in conjunction with Dusko
Pavlovic's plenary talk.

Further, there will be a TUTORIAL DAY on May 21.  The topic will be
Category Theory and Its Applications to Theoretical Computer Science.
It is being organized by Phil Scott (Ottawa); the speakers will be
announced at a later date. This event will be free to all those who
are interested in attending.

The remainder of the program will consist of papers selected by the
following PROGRAM COMMITTEE

   Andrej Bauer (Ljubljana), CHAIR
   Ulrich Berger (Swansea)
   Lars Birkedal (Copenhagen)
   Jens Blanck (Swansea)
   Steve Brookes (CMU)
   Bob Coecke (Oxford)
   Karl Crary (CMU)
   Martin Escardo (Birmingham)
   Achim Jung (Birmingham)
   Jean Krivine (LIX)
   James Laird (Sussex)
   Paul Levy (Birmingham)
   Catherine Meadows (NRL)
   Michael Mislove (Tulane)
   Catuscia Palamidessi (INRIA)
   Prakash Panangaden (McGill)
   Alex Simpson (Edinburgh)
   Christopher Stone (Harvey Mudd)
   Thomas Streicher (Darmstadt)
   James Worrell (Oxford)

from submissions received in response to this Call for Papers.

Submissions Now Open!

Authors can submit papers in response to this Call for Papers by
pointing their browser to
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mfps24
The submission process requires registering as an author and
submitting the title and a short abstract for your paper by March 7,
2008. The deadline for submissions of full papers is one week later,
March 14, 2008. The other important dates are listed below.
Papers should be no more than 15 pages in LaTeX, and should be in the
form of either a PostScript file or a pdf file suitable for printing
on a generic printer. The accepted papers will appear in ENTCS, and
the required format for ENTCS can be used for submissions. The generic
ENTCS macro package can be found at this web site. There is no special
entcsmacro.sty file for this year's MFPS Proceedings as yet; authors
who use the ENTCS macros should just use the file that comes in the
generic package.

IMPORTANT DATES:

* Fri Mar 7:   Paper registration deadline, with short abstracts.

* Fri Mar 14:  Paper submission deadline.

* Fri Apr 7:   Author notification.

* Fri Apr 21:  Final versions for the proceedings.
