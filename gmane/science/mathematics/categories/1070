CONTRIBUTED TALKS

Contributions are sought on any aspect of theoretical computer science.
Research areas within the scope of BCTCS include, but are not limited to,
the following list:

     Concurrency, types, semantics, formal methods, computational complexity,
     algorithms, discrete mathematics, proof theory and logic, 
     artificial intelligence, database theory, theorem proving,
     symbolic computation and experimental work.

This year for the first time, authors  will have the OPTION to submit
papers based on their talks to a special issue of the
Journal of Universal Computer Science. However, the meeting will retain
its informal character, and it is still possible for researchers to 
give a presentation at the meeting but not have their paper considered for
publication. 

Details of the submission of papers for the special issue can be found on
the BCTCS 15 web page.

SUPPORT FOR POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS

A limited number of fully funded places are available to postgraduate students
who are supported by EPSRC. For other students there is a SPECIAL REDUCED RATE
for the meeting, and some additional financial support may be available in
special cases.

FURTHER DETAILS

Further details, including registration forms, prices, and forms for submission
of contributed talks, are available from the BCTCS15 web page:

The web page has a list of contributed talks offered so far for BCTCS 15.
    
The web page also has links to previous BCTCS meetings, which provide a useful
guide to the wide range of topics which have been covered by past contributions.
    
BCTCS15 is organized by John Stell, who can be contacted
