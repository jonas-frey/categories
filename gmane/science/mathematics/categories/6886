My preprint "Totally distributive toposes" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4032)
has been updated to include an extended result, namely that the lex 
totally distributive categories with a small set of generators are exactly 
the injective Grothendieck toposes.

Regards,
Rory Lucyshyn-Wright

Abstract:  A locally small category E is totally distributive (as defined 
by Rosebrugh-Wood) if there exists a string of adjoint functors t -| c -| 
y, where y : E --> E^ is the Yoneda embedding. Saying that E is lex 
totally distributive if, moreover, the left adjoint t preserves finite 
limits, we show that the lex totally distributive categories with a small 
set of generators are exactly the injective Grothendieck toposes, studied 
by Johnstone and Joyal. We characterize the totally distributive 
categories with a small set of generators as exactly the essential 
subtoposes of presheaf toposes, studied by Kelly-Lawvere and 
Kennett-Riehl-Roy-Zaks.
