Hi,

thank you to those people who responded privately and gently reminded
me that the word I was looking for is 'subcanonical'. What I wrote
before is a definition equivalent to the usual one involving
representable presheaves

On a related note, I get tired of saying 'a pretopology where the
covering families consist of single maps'. Is there an established
word for this? If not, how about 'singleton pretopology'?
