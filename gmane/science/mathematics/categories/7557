-- SCOPE --

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with
interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging
uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science.

It is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the
forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on
Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on
Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place
in Swansea (Wales, 2005), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Udine (Italy, 2009)
and Winchester (UK, 2011). The fifth edition will be held in Warsaw,
the capital of Poland.

-- INVITED SPEAKERS --

Andrej Bauer - University of Lubljana, Sl
Miko??aj Boja??czyk - Warsaw University, PL
Neil Ghani - University of Strathclyde, UK
Damien Pous - CNRS, ENS-Lyon, F

-- TOPICS OF INTEREST --

We invite submissions of technical papers that report results of
theoretical work on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the
way these results can support methods and techniques for software
development, as well as experience with the transfer of the resulting
technologies into industrial practice. We encourage submissions in
topics included or related to those listed below.

  * Abstract models and logics
    - Automata and languages
    - Categorical semantics
    - Modal logics
    - Relational systems
    - Graph transformation
    - Term rewriting
    - Adhesive categories

  * Specialised models and calculi
    - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems
    - Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed, mobile, and
      context-aware computing
    - General systems theory and computational models (chemical,
      biological, etc.)

  * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
    - Abstract data types
    - Inductive and coinductive methods
    - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation)
    - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
    - Semantics of programming languages

  * System specification and verification
    - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification
    - Formal testing and quality assurance
    - Validation and verification
    - Generative programming and model-driven development
    - Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
      hardware/middleware/architectures,
    - Process algebra

-- NEW TOPICS --

This edition of CALCO will feature two new topics, and submission of
papers on these topics is especially encouraged.

   * Corecursion in Programming Languages
     - Corecursion in logic / constraint / functional / answer set
       programming
     - Corecursive type inference
     - Coinductive methods for proving program properties
     - Implementing corecursion
     - Applications

   * Algebra and Coalgebra in quantum computing
     - Categorical semantics for quantum computing
     - Quantum calculi and programming languages
     - Foundational structures for quantum computing
     - Applications of quantum algebra

-- SUBMISSION GUIDELINES --

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Experience papers are
welcome, but they must clearly present general lessons learned that
would be of interest and benefit to a broad audience of both
researchers and practitioners. As with previous editions, the
proceedings will be published in the Springer LNCS series. Final
papers should be no more than 15 pages long in the format specified by
Springer (see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). It is
recommended that submissions adhere to that format and
length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected
immediately. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included
in a clearly marked appendix. Both an abstract and the full paper must
be submitted by their respective submission deadlines.

A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer
Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), containing extended versions of
selected papers, is also being planned.

Submissions will be handled via EasyChair
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2013

-- BEST PAPER AND BEST PRESENTATION AWARDS --

For the first time, this edition of CALCO will feature two kinds of
awards: a best paper award whose recipients will be selected by the PC
before the conference and a best presentation award, elected by the
participants.

-- IMPORTANT DATES --

Abstract submission:	February 22, 2013
Paper submission:	March 1, 2013
Author notification:	May 6, 2013
Final version due:	June 3, 2013

-- ORGANISING COMMITTEE --

Bartek Klin      (University of Warsaw, Poland)
Andrzej Tarlecki (University of Warsaw, Poland)

-- LOCATION --

Warsaw, the capital of Poland, is a lively city with many historic
monuments and sights, but also with a thriving business district. It
is easily accessible via two airports: the main Chopin Airport, used by
most international carriers, and the recently open Warsaw Modlin
Airport (30 minutes away by rail), used by budget airlines.

-- SATELLITE WORKSHOPS --

CALCO 2013 will be preceded by the CALCO Early Ideas Workshop, chaired
by Monika Seisenberger (Swansea University). The workshop is dedicated
to presentation of work in progress and original research
proposals. PhD students and young researchers are particularly
encouraged to contribute. Attendance at the workshop is open to all -
it is anticipated that many CALCO conference participants will want to
attend the CALCO Early Ideas workshop (and vice versa).

A workshop dedicated to tools based on algebraic and/or coalgebraic
principles, CALCO Tools, will be held alongside the main conference,
chaired by Lutz Schr??der (Friedrich Alexander Universit??t
Erlangen-N??rnberg). Papers of this workshop will be included in the
CALCO proceedings.

-- CALCO Early Ideas Overview --

The CALCO Early Ideas Workshop invites submissions on the same topics
as the CALCO conference: reporting results of theoretical work on the
mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the way these results can
support methods and techniques for software development, as well as
experience with the transfer of the resulting technologies into
industrial practice. The list of topics of particular interest is
shown on the main CALCO 2013 page.

CALCO Early Ideas presentations will be selected according to originality,
significance, and general interest, on the basis of submitted 2-page short
contributions.  It can be work in progress, a summary of work submitted to a
conference or workshop elsewhere, or work that in some other way might be interesting to
the CALCO audience. A booklet with the accepted short contributions will be
available at the workshop.

Submissions will be handled via EasyChair
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calcoearlyideas2013
The use of LNCS style is strongly encouraged.

After the workshop, authors will have the opportunity to submit
a full 10-15 page paper on the same topic. The reviewing will be carried out by
the CALCO Early Ideas PC, with the support of the CALCO PC. The volume of
selected papers will be available online. Authors will retain copyright, and are
also encouraged to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere.

-- CALCO-Tools Overview --

CALCO-Tools will take place on the same dates as the main CALCO
conference, with no overlap between the technical programmes of the
two events. Topics of interest include systems, prototypes, and tools
developed specifically for the design, checking, execution, and
verification of (co)algebraic specifications, but also tools targeting
different application domains while making core or interesting use of
(co)algebraic techniques.

Tool submissions should not exceed 5 pages in LNCS format. The
accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of the
conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the time
of submission. Each submission will be evaluated by at least three
reviewers; one or more of the reviewers will be asked to download and
use the tool. At least one of the authors of each tool paper must
attend the conference to demo the tool.
