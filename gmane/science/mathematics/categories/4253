Without addressing this particular issue I want to say I appreciate the
phrase in the article: "the explicitly foundational role of the category
Set."  I take it this is Vaughan's?

Various people including Sol Feferman promote the view that if you use
"sets" then you are admitting that you use ZF and not some categorical
foundations.  Vaughan's phrase goes aptly against that:  If you use
sets, then you use sets, but there is no reason it cannot be on
categorical foundations.  He does not say it *is* on categorical
foundations, and that is fine in the context.  He reminds people that it
*could* be.

best, Colin
