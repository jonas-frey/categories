I totally agree. An internal fibration between groups in a topos E is =20=

a group morphism whose underlying morphism in E is an epimorphism; for =20=

a representable fibration, it is a split epimorphism in E. Jack Duskin =20=

alerted me to this many years ago.

Never-the-less, the representable notion has had some uses. Actually, =20=

Dominic Verity and I also used representably Giraud-Conduch=E9 morphisms =
=20
in

 	The comprehensive factorization and torsors, Theory and =
Applications =20
of Categories 23(3) (2010) 42-75;

whereas there is an internal version (more generally applicable in the =20=

way you explain) of these too (in a topos, for example).

Have you written or published anything on these internal notions?

Best wishes,
Ross
