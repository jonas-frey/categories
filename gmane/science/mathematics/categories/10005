PREFACE

The study of higher dimensional categories has mostly been developed in =
the globular form of 2-categories, n-categories, omega-categories and =
their weak versions. Here we study a different form: double categories, =
n-tuple categories and multiple categories, with their weak and lax =
versions.
We want to show the advantages of this form for the theory of =
adjunctions and limits. Furthermore, this form is much simpler in higher =
dimension, starting with dimension three where weak 3-categories (also =
called tricategories) are already quite complicated, much more than weak =
or lax triple categories.

This book can be used as a textbook for graduate and postgraduate =
studies, and as a basis for self-study and research. Notions are =
presented in a concrete way, with examples and exercises; the latter are =
endowed with a solution or suitable hints. Part I, devoted to double =
categories, starts at basic category theory and is kept at a relatively =
simple level. Part II can be used independently by a reader with some =
knowledge of 2-dimensional category theory.
________

The following exposition of my talk at CT2019, in Edinburgh, can also be =
viewed as a partial introduction to this book:
"Adjunctions and limits for double and multiple categories"
