Scope
~~~~~

ICFP 2013 seeks original papers on the art and science of functional
programming.  Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to
practice, from foundations to features, and from abstraction to
application.  The scope includes all languages that encourage
functional programming, including both purely applicative and
imperative languages, as well as languages with objects, concurrency,
or parallelism.  Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* Language Design: concurrency and distribution; modules; components
    and composition; metaprogramming; interoperability; type systems;
    relations to imperative, object-oriented, or logic programming

* Implementation: abstract machines; virtual machines; interpretation;
    compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; memory
    management; multi-threading; exploiting parallel hardware; interfaces
    to foreign functions, services, components, or low-level machine
    resources

* Software-Development Techniques: algorithms and data structures;
    design patterns; specification; verification; validation; proof
    assistants; debugging; testing; tracing; profiling

* Foundations: formal semantics; lambda calculus; rewriting; type
    theory; monads; continuations; control; state; effects; program
    verification; dependent types

* Analysis and Transformation: control-flow; data-flow; abstract
    interpretation; partial evaluation; program calculation

* Applications and Domain-Specific Languages: symbolic computing;
    formal-methods tools; artificial intelligence; systems programming;
    distributed-systems and web programming; hardware design; databases;
    XML processing; scientific and numerical computing; graphical user
    interfaces; multimedia programming; scripting; system
    administration; security

* Education: teaching introductory programming; parallel programming;
    mathematical proof; algebra

* Functional Pearls: elegant, instructive, and fun essays on
    functional programming

* Experience Reports: short papers that provide evidence that
    functional programming really works or describe obstacles that have
    kept it from working

If you are concerned about the appropriateness of some topic, do not
hesitate to contact the program chair.

Abbreviated instructions for authors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* By Thursday, 28 March 2013, 23:59 UTC-11 (American Samoa time),
    submit a full paper of at most 12 pages (6 pages for an Experience
    Report), including bibliography and figures.

The deadlines will be strictly enforced and papers exceeding the page
limits will be summarily rejected.

* Authors have the option to attach supplementary material to a
    submission, on the understanding that reviewers may choose not to
    look at it.

* Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as
    explained on the web at
    http://www.acm.org/sigplan/republicationpolicy.htm

* Authors of resubmitted (but previously rejected) papers have the
    option to attach an annotated copy of the reviews of their previous
    submission(s), explaining how they have addressed these previous
    reviews in the present submission.  If a reviewer identifies
    him/herself as a reviewer of this previous submission and wishes to
    see how his/her comments have been addressed, the program chair will
    communicate to this reviewer the annotated copy of his/her previous
    review.  Otherwise, no reviewer will read the annotated copies of
    the previous reviews.

Overall, a submission will be evaluated according to its relevance,
correctness, significance, originality, and clarity.  It should
explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly
identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is
significant, and comparing it with previous work.  The technical
content should be accessible to a broad audience.  Functional Pearls
and Experience Reports are separate categories of papers that need not
report original research results and must be marked as such at the
time of submission.  Detailed guidelines on both categories are on the
conference web site.

Proceedings will be published by ACM Press.  Authors of accepted
submissions are expected to transfer the copyright to the
ACM.  Presentations will be videotaped and released online if the
presenter consents.

Formatting: Submissions must be in PDF format printable in black and
white on US Letter sized paper and interpretable by
Ghostscript. Papers must adhere to the standard ACM conference format:
two columns, nine-point font on a ten-point baseline, with columns
20pc (3.33in) wide and 54pc (9in) tall, with a column gutter of 2pc
(0.33in).  A suitable document template for LaTeX is
available:http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm

Submission: Submissions will be accepted on the web
athttps://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dicfp2013 . Improved
versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before the
submission deadline using the same web interface.

Author response: Authors will have a 72-hour period, starting at 0:00
UTC-11 on Wednesday, 22 May 2013, to read reviews and respond to them.

Special Journal Issue: There will be a special issue of the Journal of
Functional Programming with papers from ICFP 2013.  The program
committee will invite the authors of select accepted papers to submit
a journal version to this issue.
