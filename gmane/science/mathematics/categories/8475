Hi, Michael.

I thought I would mention one more thing.  I think that this book and =
other work
is just the beginning of a whole new area of applied CT.  Perhaps I am =
wrong.

However, there are a few groups of people working on new applications =
using
primarily CT.

For example, check out the recent work of John Baez:

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/index.html

John and his students have been making progress studying network theory
and control theory using CT.  This includes electrical circuits and =
chemical=20
reactions.

Also, check out the recent report=20

"Report from Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshop 14182: Categorical Methods =
at the Crossroads=94

http://vesta.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/opus/volltexte/2014/4618/pdf/dagrep=
_v004_i004_p049_s14182.pdf

This was a meeting to discuss using CT as the basis for math modeling =
and=20
applied science.

Very best,
Harley
