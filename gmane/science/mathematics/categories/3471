For the purposes of defining the data structure of integers in a
Coq-like system, I am looking for an _algebraic_ characterization of
integers Z as a commutative ring with unit. (The one-element ring is a
ring.)

Some possible characterizations which I don't much like:

1) Z is the free group generated by one generator. I want the ring
structure, not the group structure.

2) Z is the free ring generated by the semiring of natural numbers. This
just translates the problem to characterization of the semiring of
natural numbers.

3) Z is the initial non-trivial ring. This is no good because
"non-trivial" is an inequality "0 =/= 1" rather than an equality.

4) Let R be the free commutative ring with unit generated by X. Then Z
is the image of the homomorphism R --> R which maps X to 0. This is just
ugly and there must be something better.

I feel like I am missing something obvious. Surely Z appears as a
prominent member of the category of commutative rings with unit, does it
not?

Best regards,

Andrej
