I did not know that Elsevier had changed it policies in that regard.  I
did know that if you asked they would send you a different copyright
transfer form asking only for a permission to print, but you had to know
to ask for it and my last publication in PAA was a dozen years ago.  And a
colleague of mine got a "lawyer's letter" from some journal demanding that
he remove a paper from his own web site.

Although I am glad (I suppose) to hear that they have yielded on this
point, my basic objection remains.
