I forget who said what, but I think the issue was that when folks
are talking in this movie, you can't easily tell whether they are 
saying "2-categories" or "two categories", i.e. a couple of categories.  

This problem comes up a lot in my life, and I am glad to see it 
finally showing up in a major motion picture!  E.g., I must be
careful never to say "functor between two categories", replacing 
it by "functor from one category to another".
 
I would be shocked if they were talking about 2-categories in
this movie.  Even mentioning categories must seriously diminish 
their ticket sales, much less 2-categories.  

On a wholly different note, how are the category theorists in
Sydney?
