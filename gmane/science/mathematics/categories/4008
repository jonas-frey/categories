Now, now, if we're really embracing the ancient grammar to this extent,
then we should drop the prepositions that english uses to accomodate the
same semantic space that once was handled by cases. Thus, I would rewrite
the above as

"Ignorance there could get you off to a bad start topoin."

And of course, once we enter this course, what's more natural than letting
old english, and even old norse guide our cases throughout?
