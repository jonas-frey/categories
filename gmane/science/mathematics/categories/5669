*************** New deadlines: ***************

Submission deadline:....April 9, 2010 (23:59 Pacific (UTC-8))

(Due to circumstances beyond our control, the previous Call for Papers,
with earlier deadlines, has not been circulated, but only posted on the
web. In order to be able to circulate this Call, we postponed the
deadlines. As a consequence, the publication date of the proceedings,
which are planned in the same format, has been moved to after the
conference.)


BACKGROUND

The major goal of the AMAST Conferences is to promote research that may
lead to the setting of software technology on a firm, mathematical basis.
This goal is achieved by a large international cooperation with
contributions from both academia and industry. The virtues of a software
technology developed on a mathematical basis include the provision of
software that is

* correct, and the correctness can be proved mathematically,

* safe, so that it can be used in the implementation of critical systems,

* portable, i.e., independent of computing platforms and language generatio=
ns,

* evolutionary, i.e. it adapts to the environment changes, and evolves
with the problem domain,

* secure, so that its network and user interactions can be predicted and
controlled.

All previous editions of the AMAST Conference, which were held at Iowa
City (1989,1991), Twente (1993), Montreal (1995), Munich (1996), Sydney
(1997), Manaus (1999), Iowa City (2000), Reunion Island (2002), Stirling
(2004), Saaremaa (2006) and Urbana-Champaign (2008), made contributions to
the AMAST goals by reporting and disseminating academic and industrial
achievements within the AMAST area of interest. During these meetings,
AMAST attracted an international following among researchers and
practitioners interested in software technology, programming methodology
and their algebraic and logical foundations.

The 2010 conference will be held in Lac-Beauport, a suburb of Qu=C3=A9bec
City, Canada, and will be colocated with MPC '10 (21-23 June 2010).

TOPICS

As in previous years, we invite papers reporting original research on
setting software technology on a firm mathematical basis. We expect two
kinds of submissions: technical papers and system demonstrations. Of
particular interest is research on using algebraic, logic, and other
formalisms suitable as foundations for software technology, as well as
software technologies developed by means of logic and algebraic
methodologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the
following:

** Software technology
* systems software technology
* application software technology
* software architecture
* concurrent and reactive systems
* formal methods in industrial software development
* requirements engineering
* software synthesis
* evolutionary and adaptive software systems

** Programming methodology
* logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms
* constraint programming and concurrency
* program transformation and verification
* programming calculi
* specification languages and tools
* incremental development
* web programming and network computation

** Algebraic and logical foundations
* logic in computer science
* category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra
* algebraic foundations for languages, systems and specifications
* coinduction and coalgebraic methods
* logical frameworks and theorem proving
* logics of programs
* formal approaches to dependability and security

** Systems and tools (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers)
* software development environments
* provably correct software development
* validation and verification
* security tools
* system support for reuse
* tools for prototyping
* component based software development tools
* computer algebra systems
* theorem proving systems


PUBLICATION

As in the past, the proceedings of AMAST 2010 will be published by
Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The preliminary
version of the proceedings will be available at the conference. The final
version will be distributed after the conference.

We invite prospective authors to submit electronically previously
unpublished papers of high quality. Submissions should not have been
published and should not be under consideration for publication elsewhere.
Papers must be no longer than 15 pages (6 pages for system demonstrations)
and should be prepared using LaTeX and the LNCS style that can be
downloaded from http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html. The
submission site and dates are at the beginning of this Call.

VENUE

The conference will be held in the Manoir St-Castin
(http://www.hotelsvillegia.com/villegia_stcastin/pages-eg/). This resort
is located on the shore of Beauport lake, 15 minutes from downtown Qu=C3=A9=
bec
City (http://www.quebecregion.com/en/) and 15 minutes from the Jean-Lesage
International Airport.
