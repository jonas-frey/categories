>Answer to Toby Bartels:
>(i) You propose to compose the spans by pullbacks. Here is an example of two spans  A <-- X --> B and B <-- Y --> C such that the functors  A <--X  and  Y --> C are isos, the functors X --> B and  B <-- Y have unique quasi inverses, and if  Z is the pullback none of the functors  A <-- Z  and  Z --> B is a weak equivalence:
>Take A=X=Y=C=1, take for B the coarse category with two objects  a and b  , for X --> B and  B <-- Y  the functors  "a": 1 --> B  and  B <-- 1: "b"  . The pullback  Z is 0.

By "pullback", I meant what you above call "2-pull-back" or "pseudo pull-back".
Then Z is again (up to isomorphism) 1.

>How stronger a counter example do you need? And using zig-zags will make the situation even worse.

Using zigzags, one would compose zigzags directly and use no pullbacks.

>(ii) you define equivalences by spans, not "up to anything". With this definition an equivalence between 1 and 1 is any non empty coarse category. Every non empty set determines up to isomorphism such a category. thus there are at least as many equivalences from 1 to 1 in your sense as there are non empty sets. A bit much don't you think?

Indeed, so one must also define natural isomorphism of equivalences.
If you have any difficulty, the answer is in Makkai's anafunctor paper:
http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/anafun/

>(but hurry, because after this mail there might very well be a quick revision of the article).

Nothing is hidden in the nLab.
If it changes, click "History" at the bottom of the page.
