I find this paper very helpful as someone trying to understand the  applica=
tions of density: the idea that density gives rise to algebraic analogues o=
f presheaves is appealing. For example I have been unable to get directly a=
 nice dense subcategory of the category of crossed complexes, but have veri=
fied that for the equivalent category of cubical omega-groupoids with conne=
ctions the full subcategory on the free such gadgets on n-cubes is dense. =
=0AThus dense sub categories seem a basic tool for `categories for the work=
ing mathematician'! A paper is in preparation on density and crossed comple=
xes  with an application to tensor products, with Ross Street. =0A=0AOn the=
 more philosophical points about types and properties, I tend to look at th=
is from my experience (not wholly good, but way back) with the computer alg=
ebra system AXIOM. The notion of `type' was not defined clearly, though num=
erous examples were in the system, but `type' included a signature (is this=
 a `property'?) , which specified the `types' of the outputs,  the `types' =
of the inputs, and the whole `type' included information on axioms, records=
, algorithms, printing, etc. I have often wondered what is the proper theor=
y of these `types', as used in AXIOM. =0A=0AI like also the point about the=
 relevance of evolution. The geneticist Dobzhansky wrote a famous paper wit=
h title `Nothing in biology makes sense  except in the light of evolution',=
 (American Biolology Teacher, 1973)  and I think we have to accept that mat=
hematics is a biological product (from humans, I suppose). I have said a li=
ttle about this in the second of two presentations downloadable from =0Awww=
.banngor.ac.uk/r.brown/askloster.html=0Awhich points out also a report of t=
he amazing computational properties of the cricket nervous system. =0A=0ARo=
