CONCUR 2003, the 14th international conference on concurrency theory, is
organized by the Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Marseille (LI=
F).
The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together researchers,
developers and students in order to advance the theory of concurrency, an=
d
promote its applications. Interest in this topic is continuously growing,=
 as
a consequence of the importance and ubiquity of concurrent systems and th=
eir
applications, and of the scientific relevance of their foundations.=20

Submissions are solicited in all areas of semantics, logics and verificat=
ion
techniques for concurrent systems. Principal topics include (but are not
limited to):
     - Basic models and logics of concurrent and distributed computation
       (such as process algebras, Petri nets, domain theoretic or game
       theoretic models, modal and temporal logics).=20
     - Specialized or enriched models (such as circuits, synchronous
       systems, real time and hybrid systems, stochastic systems, data
       bases, mobile and migrating systems, parametric protocols,
       security protocols).=20
     - Related verification techniques and tools (such as state-space
       exploration, model-checking, synthesis, abstraction, automated
       deduction, testing).=20
     - Related programming models (such as distributed, constraints or
       object oriented, graph rewriting, as well as associated type syste=
ms,
       static analyses, abstract machines, and environments).=20

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract not exceeding 15 pages
electronically via the web submission form at the conference's web site.
Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee for inclusion in t=
he
proceedings, which will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture No=
tes in
Computer Science series. Papers must contain original contributions, be c=
learly
written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison with related=
 work.
Simultaneous submissions to other conferences are not allowed.=20

Important dates=20
     Submission: April 4, 2003  --> There will be no deadline extension.
     Notification: May 26, 2003=20
     Final version: June 10, 2003=20
