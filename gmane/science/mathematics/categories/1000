hi.

there is probably a bit of duality in Grothendieck's TVS book. perhaps
there is more in one of his functional analysis papers from the 50es, all
referenced in the book.

an even earlier source, with a hint of the chu construction, is George
Mackey's work on barreled spaces, as pointed out to me by Bill Lawvere.
