A slightly more recent exposition is given in 

D. A. Edwards and H. M. Hastings, Cech and Steenrod homotopy theories with
applications to geometric topology, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 542,
Springer, 1976

on pages 6--7.  It is a bit strange that Edwards and Hastings credit
Mardesic and do not mention Deligne.  Understandably, they must have been
more familiar with the literature on shape theory than on algebraic
geometry.
