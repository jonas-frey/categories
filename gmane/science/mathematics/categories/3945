This is correct; there is simply no way of getting around the fact that=20
ideals form not just a lattice but carry a quantale structure derived=20
from the ring.  [See my next post and the quotation below.] =20

I'd point you to Wikipedia, only the relevant articles are somewhat=20
scattered about.  Briefly, every ideal in a Noetherian ring can be=20
written as a finite intersection of _primary_ ideals, and this can=20
be made essentially unique by adding appropriate restrictions.=20

To obtain a more easily recognisable version of the Fundamental=20
Theorem of Arithmetic, it then remains to determine under what=20
circumstances a primary ideal must be a prime power.  [A good=20
counter-example is Z[x,y], where the ideal (x,y^2) is primary,=20
but falls strictly between the prime ideal (x,y) and its square
(x,y)^2=3D(x^2,xy,y^2).] =20

A Noetherian integral domain which does have this extra property=20
is called a Dedekind domain; examples include the ring of algebraic=20
integers w.r.t. an arbitrary number field---proving the latter result=20
(which is connected to an infamously incorrect proof of Fermat's=20
last theorem) is commonly cited as Dedekind's original motivation=20
for defining ideals.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_decomposition
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_domain
for details. =20

Jeff Egger.
