Thanks very much, Toby.  I didn't (and still don't) have any intuition
into what objects and morphisms are present in the free topos with NNO,
but your proof will help me fill in the gaps in this neighborhood of it.

On the one hand there are lots of objects one can talk about in language
analogous to that characterizing the NNO, on the other there are also
lots of morphisms one can talk about that identify those objects (up to
isomorphism), and I'm still at the very early stage of learning how to
walk along that ridge line without falling off one side or the other.

Joyal and Moerdijk, Algebraic Set Theory, show how to construct
sup-semilattices with sups up to a specified size S.   Obviously not
every topos with NNO supports every S, but presumably S = K
(Kuratowski-finite) is always present.  Your proof if correct shows that
ts = t is too strong.  What if I relax it to ts <= t and proceed as in
J&M to construct the initial such object?  Can you still construct your
isomorphism, or do we end up with a weaker relationship?  If the latter
then we should have t(0) >= t(s(0)) = t(1) >= t(2) >= ... >= x for any
natural number x.  Obviously t(0) is minimal among all terms having at
least one t, which should make t(0) the ordinal w.

The one disconcerting thing here is that initiality has made t(0) an
infinite sup even though I assumed only finite sups.  I don't know
whether this means that the methods of J&M can't construct this initial
algebra, or that in every topos with NNO one can construct the requisite
sup-semilattices with countable sups.  I suppose it must be the latter.

(I'm a complete novice here, as I've said before, so I hope people will
be patient with my appalling ignorance of topos-theoretic techniques.)
