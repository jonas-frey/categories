                28th Foundational Methods in Computer Science Workshop
                                     June 9-12, 2020, University Of Ottawa



Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop that brings =
together researchers in theoretical computer science and category theory.  =
Past workshops have enjoyed talks in areas such as categorical quantum mech=
anics, restriction categories, database design, and the differential and re=
source logics.  We will host tutorials and talks in several of these and re=
lated areas.

We anticipate having talks and tutorials for the entire day on June 9,10 an=
d 11,  with the possibility of additional talks on the morning of the 12th,=
  depending on how many talks are volunteered.

The conference website is at http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~rblute/FMCS2020.

This year, FMCS will immediately follow the 2020 Canadian Mathematical Soci=
ety Summer Meeting, also held in Ottawa. We suggest attendees check out the=
  schedule for that conference as there are a number of sessions of interest=
  to category theorists.

Support for graduate students:

We particularly encourage graduate students to attend FMCS and to present t=
heir work. Some limited funding is available to support graduate students w=
ho wish to attend FMCS. To obtain the discounted registration and to apply =
for this funding you should contact one of the local organizers.

Talks:

Anyone interested in giving a talk or tutorial should contact the local org=
anizers, no later than May 15th. But earlier is better.

Housing:

We were unable to reserve housing in the campus dorms, but there will likel=
y be some individual rooms available. We will be listing hotels on the conf=
erence website shortly. It is recommended not to wait until the last minute=
  to book accommodations.

Registration:

There will be a small registration fee. It will help to cover refreshments =
and subsidize students.


Local Organizers:
