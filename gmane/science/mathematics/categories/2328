Dear All,

In reply to Toby Bartels, there are various models of higher categories
in which the syntax is well attested and the `sliding of tiles' is
algebraically described.  One possible one that extends to arbitrary
dimensions is given in the paper:


        AL-AGL, A.A., BROWN, R. & STEINER, R., Multiple categories: the
        equivalence of a globular and a cubical approach, Advances in
        Math. 170 (2002) 71-118.

The links between `cubical' syntax and a more globular syntax are at the
heart of the extensive work on the equivalence between the various
models for weak n-categories. One problem is that there are no normal
forms for elements. In fact I think (possibly!) that the problem of
rewriting in these higher dimensional settings needs a higher
dimensional rewriting systems, and to model that one needs n-cateories
(and so on!)
