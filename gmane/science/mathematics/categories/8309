This is what I answered Timothy:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
No, it=92s not.
Since the category has a terminal object (1,1), being a LCCC would imply =
it
was cartesian closed. However, that would imply (G,X) \times =97 =
preserved
the initial object (1,0), which is false: (G,X)\times (1,0) =3D (G,0).
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

But it seems there is more to the story.=20
The thing stopping the category of actions from
being cartesian closed is that the category Gp of groups is not. =
However,
the category Gpd of groupoids and the category Cat of categories are.
The (2-)category Cat//=92Set=92 of all category actions is defined as =
follows:
objects (A,F) are functors F : A =97> Set and morphisms (f,t) : (A,F) =97>=
  (B,G)
are functors f : A =97> B with natural transformation t : F =3D=3D> G f.
This (2-)category is cartesian closed: the internal hom [(B,G),(C,H)] is
([B,C], K) where [B,C] is the functor category and K(g) =3D [B,Set](G, H =
g).

However Cat//=92Set=92 is not locally cartesian closed basically because =
Cat
is not. It is not even locally cartesian closed as a bicategory.
The 2-category Gpd is cartesian closed; it is not locally cartesian =
closed;
it is locally cartesian closed as a bicategory.=20

Similarly, Gpd//=92Set=92 is locally cartesian closed as a bicategory.
Often, in dealing with groups, we find groupoids help.
This case is a good example and I hope helps in the applications
you have in mind, Timothy.
