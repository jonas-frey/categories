If you or your students are interested in learning more about =
applications of category theory to programming languages, this summer =
school might be of interest.  This year we will have a basic =
introduction to categorical semantics of programming languages, and two =
more advanced courses that consider two programming languages ideas, =
logical relations and type refinement, from a categorical perspective.
