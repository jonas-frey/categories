-- SCOPE --

MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic, and computer science that are related to models of computation, in general, and to the semantics of programming languages, in particular. The series has particularly stressed providing a forum where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and exchange ideas about problems of common interest. As the series also strives to maintain breadth in its scope, the conference strongly encourages participation by researchers in neighbouring areas.

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science. It is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Swansea (Wales, 2005), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Udine (Italy, 2009), Winchester (UK, 2011), Warsaw (Poland, 2013) and Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015).

-- LOCATION --

Ljubljana is the capital of Slovenia and its largest city. It???s history can be traced back to Roman times, and in the very center, one can still see the remains of Roman walls and villas of the city Emona that once stood there. After a major earthquake hit Ljubljana in 1895, most of the buildings were rebuilt in Italian Baroque and Art Nouveau style, though quite a few buildings, including the castle, survived in their original form. Ljubljanica river runs through the middle of Ljubljana, and especially in pleasant summer evenings, its banks are the perfect place to have a meal or drink.


Ljubljana has a vibrant cultural scene, with numerous exhibitions, theatre plays, concerts and international festivals taking place. Being situated in the middle of Slovenia, Ljubljana is also a perfect starting point for exploring Slovenia. In a single day, you can have either a trip to the Alps, or to the seaside. If you are enthusiastic, you could also do both in the same day! Though, truth be told, you???ll have more than enough to see in Ljubljana alone for the duration of the conference.
