FOURTH INTERNATION WORKSHOP ON INTUITIONISTIC MODAL LOGIC AND APPLICATIONS =
(IMLA'08)
  http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vdp/IMLA08.html
  A LICS'08 affiliated workshop
  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, June 23, 2008
* Constructive modal logics and type theories are of increasing foundationa=
l
  and practical relevance in computer science. Applications are in type
  disciplines for programming languages, and meta-logics for reasoning abou=
t
  a variety of computational phenomena.
  Theoretical and methodological issues center around the question of
  how the proof-theoretic strengths of constructive logics can best be
  combined with the model-theoretic strengths of modal
  logics. Practical issues center around the question which modal
  connectives with associated laws or proof rules capture
  computational phenomena accurately and at the right level of
  abstraction.
  This workshop will bring together designers, implementers, and users
  to discuss all aspects of intuitionistic modal logics and type
  theories.
* Topics include, but are not limited to:
  - applications of intuitionistic necessity and possibility
  - monads and strong monads
  - constructive belief logics and type theories
  - applications of constructive modal logic and modal type theory to
    formal verification, foundations of security, abstract
    interpretation, and program analysis and optimization
  - modal types for integration of inductive and co-inductive types, higher=
\
  - order abstract syntax, strong functional programming
  - models of constructive modal logics such as algebraic,
    categorical, Kripke, topological, and realizability
    interpretations
  - notions of proof for constructive modal logics
  - extraction of constraints or programs from modal proofs
  - proof search methods for constructive modal logics and their
    implementations
* The workshop continues a series of previous LICS-affiliated
  workshops, which were held as part of FLoC'99, Trento, Italy and of
  FLoC'02, Copenhagen, Denmark.
* IMPORTANT DATES:
  Submission: April 25, 2008

WORKSHOP ON LOGIC AND SEARCH (LaSh08)
  Computation of structures from declarative descriptions
  Call For Papers
  Leuven, Belgium, November 6-7, 2008
  http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/LaSh08
* IMPORTANT DATES
  Submission: August 15, 2008
  Notification: September 15, 2008
  Workshop: November 6-7, 2008
* SCOPE
  In many real-life problems, we search for objects of complex nature --
  plans, schedules, assignments. Such objects are often represented as
  (finite) structures, which are implicitly specified by means of
  theories in some logic. Thus, languages are needed to describe
  structures, and algorithms to extract them from these implicit
  descriptions. Propositional Satisfiability (SAT), Constraint
  Programming (CP), and Answer Set Programming (ASP) are arguably the
  three most prominent areas that develop such languages and techniques.

  Each of these areas has been proposed as a declarative programming
  approach to solving NP-complete combinatorial problems. Such problems
  abound in computer science, engineering, operations research
  computational biology and other fields. In many cases, progress is
  limited by the difficulty of designing implicit representations of
  structures (modeling), which hinders common acceptance of the aproach,
  and the inability to solve sufficiently large instances of the
  problems in practical time bounds (search algorithms). Therefore,
  these three areas have as a major goal the development of practical
  modeling languages and methodologies that support the modeling, and
  algorithms and tools for efficient problem solving.

  Despite the similar goals of these areas, in many respects SAT, ASP and
  CP develop as three independent disciplines, focusing on rather different
  particular problems or questions.  There are few, if any, researchers
  who are experts in all three areas. To date, we are not aware of any
  meeting which specifically aims at bringing these three areas together.
* Objectives
  LaSh08 aims to offer a discussion forum for research in SAT, ASP and
  CP that focuses on the computation of structures from declarative
  descriptions.  We invite contributions on modeling languages,
  methodologies, theoretical analysis, techniques, algorithms and
  systems. The forum is an occasion to exchange ideas on the
  state-of-the-art; to discuss specific technical problems; to formulate
  challenges and opportunities ahead; to analyse differences and
  simularities between the different areas; to study opportunities for
  synergy and integration.
* In particular, we would like to foster exchange at least on the
  following topics:
  - integrations of  SAT, ASP and/or CP technologies
  - comparisons of modeling languages
  - criteria for choice of modeling languages
    (for modeling convenience or efficiency)
  - new algorithm directions
  - efficient modeling  strategies
  - new  applications
  - complexity results, tractable subsets
  - completeness results (e.g. capturing complexity classes)
  - methods for taking advantage of tractability results
  - solver implementation techniques,
  - algorithms for grounding
  - modeling languages and constructs
          (aggregates, global constraints,..)
  - search control and heuristics in the context of model generation
  - symmetry breaking in model construction
  - optimisation problems in model construction:
    - languages for optimality criteria;
    - algorithms for computing optimal models
* Systems and Tools:
  LaSh08 will also provide an opportunity for presentation of implemented
  systems and tools at a demo session. Thus, we invite submissions of
  systems and tools that reflect the above ideas, and aim at facilitating
  declarative problem solving, and making it practical and used.

* Location
  The conference will take place in the Beguinage of Leuven,
  Belgium. Leuven is an old flemish town, hosting the oldest university
  of the lower countries. The Beguinage is a medieval city in the city,
  where the beguines lived together to form a religious community. The
  Beguinage is recognized as a Unesco World Heritage site.


POSTDOC AND PROGRAMMER POSITIONS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE SCHOOL OF COMPUTER SC=
IENCE AND ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA.
* The positions are associated to an Australian Research Council Linkage
  Grant funded project "Model Checking Logics of Knowledge and
  Probability in Pursuit-Evasion Games".  The research will involve the
  development of model checking techniques for the logic of knowledge,
  probability and time, and their evaluation in the partner's
  application: pursuit-evasion games motivated from search and rescue
  mission planning problems.
