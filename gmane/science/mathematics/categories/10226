ICFP 2020 Student Research Competition
        Call for Submissions

ICFP invites students to participate in the Student Research
Competition, which will be held virtually alongside the main
conference, in order to present their research and receive
feedback from prominent members of the programming language
research community.

As usual, the SRC consists of three rounds:

* Extended abstract
* Poster session at ICFP 2020
* ICFP presentation

To make the virtual competition fruitful, we will make sure
that every student will have an "invited audience"=C2=A0during the
poster=C2=A0session.=C2=A0 We are also planning to organize a social even=
t
for the students.  Please visit the SRC website for updates.

### Important Dates

Submissions due: 26 Jun 2020 (Friday)
    https://icfp20src.hotcrp.com
Notification: 10 July 2020 (Friday)
Conference: 23 August (Sunday) - 28 August (Friday)

### Submission Details

Each submission (referred to as "abstract" below) should include the
student author=E2=80=99s name and e-mail address; institutional affiliati=
on;
research advisor=E2=80=99s name; ACM student member number; category
(undergraduate or graduate); research title; and an extended abstract
addressing the following:

* Problem and Motivation: Clearly state the problem being addressed and
explain the reasons for seeking a solution to this problem.

* Background and Related Work: Describe the specialized (but
pertinent) background necessary to appreciate the work in the
context of ICFP areas of interest. Include references to the
literature where appropriate, and briefly explain where your work
departs from that done by others.

* Approach and Uniqueness: Describe your approach in addressing the
problem and clearly state how your approach is novel.

* Results and Contributions: Clearly show how the results of your work
contribute to programming language design and implementation in
particular and to computer science in general; explain the
significance of those results.

* Submissions must be original research that is not already published
at ICFP or another conference or journal. One of the goals of the
SRC is to give students feedback on ongoing, unpublished
work. Furthermore, the abstract must be authored solely by the
student. If the work is collaborative with others and*or part of a
larger group project, the abstract should make clear what the
student=E2=80=99s role was and should focus on that portion of the work.

* Formatting: Submissions must be in PDF format, printable in black
and white on US Letter sized paper, and interpretable by common PDF
tools. All submissions must adhere to the "ACM Small" template that
is available (in both LaTeX and Word formats) from
https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions. For authors
using LaTeX, a lighter-weight package, including only the essential
files, is available from
http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format. The submission
must not exceed 3 pages in PDF format. Reference lists do not count
towards the 3-page limit.
