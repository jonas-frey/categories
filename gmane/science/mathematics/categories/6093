On the other hand, am I right that you (John) have also written about
string diagrams in closed (non-autonomous) monoidal categories? Those
are a bit subtler, and I don't recall them in the work of Joyal and
Street (am I wrong?).  The original question used the word
"autonomous" but the notation used suggested a merely closed monoidal
category, so perhaps that's what he had in mind.
