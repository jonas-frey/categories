36th International Conference on Mathematical Foundations of Programming
Semantics ??? MFPS 2020

June 2 ??? 6, 2020
To be jointly held with QPL'20.
https://www.monoidal.net/paris2020/mfps/

# About

MFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and
computer science that are related to models of computation in general,
and to semantics of programming languages in particular. This is a forum
where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and
exchange ideas. The participation of researchers in neighbouring areas
is strongly encouraged.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: concurrent
qualitative and quantitative distributed systems; process calculi;
probabilistic systems; constructive mathematics; domain theory and
categorical models; formal languages; formal methods; game semantics;
lambda calculus; programming-language theory; quantum computation;
security; topological models; logic; type systems; type theory. We also
welcome contributions that address applications of semantics to novel
areas such as complex systems, markets, and networks, for example.

# Online Event

MFPS 2020 will be held online, jointly with the 17th International
Conference on Quantum and Physics Logic (QPL) 2020. We will hold a live
meeting using video and online discussion platforms.

Registration is free but mandatory. Please follow this link:
https://forms.gle/Bozgh92BoLUQxVaD7
to register.
