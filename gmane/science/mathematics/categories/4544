After four very successful conferences in Amsterdam in 2005, Swansea in
2006, Siena in 2007 and Athens in 2008, our community has officially
formed the association

                          Computability in Europe

at the Annual General Meeting at this year's Computability in Europe
conference in Athens.  The object of the Association is to promote the
development, particularly in Europe, of computability-related science,
ranging over mathematics, computer science, and applications in various
natural and engineering sciences such as physics and biology. This also
includes the promotion of the study of philosophy and history of computing
as it relates to questions of computability. A draft constitution of the
Association can be found at

http://www.amsta.leeds.ac.uk/~pmt6sbc/CiE.const.draft.pdf

We invite every researcher interested in the object of the Association to
become a member.  The initial membership fee is set at zero, and lasts
until 30 June 2010.

To apply for membership of the Association, please complete and submit the
form at

http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/acie/

Any enquiries concerning association CiE membership should be sent to the
Membership Secretary, Arnold Beckmann, at a.beckmann@swansea.ac.uk.

If you are not interested in becoming a member of this Association, we
apologise for any inconvenience caused.

With best regards,
Association Computability in Europe
