No.  For example, in the category of topological abelian groups, Z is far
from injective.  Nonetheless, if you say that a group is Z-compact when it
is an equalizer of two maps between powers of Z, then an equalizer of two
maps between Z-compact abelian groups is again Z-compact.  The proof is
not direct.  As it happens, I am talking on this in our seminar tomorrow.

Even though the reals are not injective in hausdorff spaces, a space is
realcompact iff it is a closed subspace of a power of R, which turns out
to be equivalent to being an equalizer of two maps between powers of R
(that is a cokernel pair of such a closed inclusion has enough real-valued
functions to separate points) and it is clear that a closed subspace of a
realcompact space is again realcompact.  Same thing for N-compact.  In
fact, for every example I have looked at sufficiently closely.
