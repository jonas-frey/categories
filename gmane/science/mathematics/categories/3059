A comment on combinatorial models for spaces : there is the notion of a
CW-poset (due to Bjoerner) which is a poset that can be identified with
the poset of cells of a regular CW-complex; those posets have very
special properties, but from a homotopy point of view, every space is
weakly homotopy equivalent to a regular CW-complex, so every space has a
``CW-poset-model''. Taking the nerve of this poset yields a
``simplicial-set-model'' of the same space; geometrically, the passage
from the poset to its nerve corresponds to barycentric subdivision. Now,
there is an old paper by Daniel Kan (Amer. J. Math. 79 (1957) 449-476,
section 10), where he shows that the barycentric subdivision of a
simplicial set actually has the structure of a symmetric simplicial set.
So, to some extent, symmetric simplicial sets are doubly subdivided
regular CW-complexes. What I wanted to point out is that in the
progression CW-poset->simplicial set->symmetric simplicial set, the
combinatorial information about the space is not increasing, but rather
decreasing, which is one possible argument in favour of simplicial sets
versus symmetric simplicial sets. Another argument for the category of
simplicial sets is that it is a topos which contains the category of
small categories as a full reflective monoidal subcategory. A third
argument is the ubiquitous occurence of simplicial cotriple resolutions.

In his pursuit of stacks, Grothendieck raises the question of what is
the structure on a small category A, which ensures that the presheaf
topos A^ may be endowed with a homotopy theory equivalent to the
homotopy theory of spaces (such a category is called a test-category) or
with the homotopy theory of spaces above a given space (such a category
is called a local-test-category). In the presence of an r/s adjunction
like in Lavwere's message above, the criteria of being local-test or
test are easily spelled out:

A is local-test iff for each object a of A, the projection A[a]\times
\Omega_A\to A[a] realises to a weak equivalence, where \Omega_A is the
subobject classifier of A^ and A[a] is the presheaf represented by a.

A is test iff A is local-test and the nerve of A is weakly contractible.
