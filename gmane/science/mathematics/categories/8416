I can recommend the following books:

=93Categorical Logic and Type Theory=94 by Bart Jacobs
http://www.cs.ru.nl/B.Jacobs/CLT/bookinfo.html

=93Categories for Types=94 by Roy Crole
=
http://www.amazon.com/Categories-Studies-Emotion-Social-Interaction/dp/052=
1450926

Both of these are related to the study of type theory =97 and logic =97 =
which can be seen as a=20
logical foundation to functional programming.  So not in terms of CS in =
general.

The following is another =93introduction=94 to category theory, but has =
lots of examples:
=93Categories for Computer Science=94 by R. F. C. Walters

=
http://www.amazon.com/Categories-Computer-Science-Cambridge-Texts/dp/05214=
22264

These are all the ones I can think of right now.  I am interested in =
what others have to
offer.  I have not found much in the way of books covering a wide =
spectra of CS, but
rather only specialties.=20

Very best,
.\ Harley
