Concerning terminology one more opinion exemplified by this example:

I think that it is a VERY BAD HABIT to attach a mathematical meaning to
words that have a comun use in every-day language, which come together
with all sorts of connotations. Like "schizofrenic".

Somebody proposed "schimatic", and I find this a good choice:

1) it is erudite and etimologically justified

2) it sounds right

3) (and more important). It is not a word known in everyday language.
For example, I did not know it (neither in spanish, english or french).

So, when I would see "schimatic" in a math text, I would say "what the
hell does it mean ?", and look at the mathematical definition. Then I
will know, and "schimatic" will have attached from now on only its
mathematical meaning.

I suggest that when in need of a word for a mathematical concept, to
look at the LATIN language, which is a DEAD language, so no problems.
And furthermore, it has a long tradition for scientific names.

(and plurals "topoi" for example ja! sorry Peter)
