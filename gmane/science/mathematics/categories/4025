	I doubt if there is much of one.

	I suppose _some_ sort of connection might be made through the concept
of "invariance" -  Benford's law holds for distributions that are wide
enough not to have a "natural scale".  If you cannot give an approximate
answer to "how big is a (river/piece of string/data file/bank deposit)?"
  then the distribution of first digits in (say) centimeters should
[waving hands hard] be the same as that in furlongs or wavelengths of
green light; and from that property Benford's law follows.

	On the other hand, humans are approximately of a height, to the point
that the foot, hand, cubit, fathom, etc. can be used as rough units in
their natural form.  Thus there is a natural scale for human heights,
and we are not surprised that almost all human heights in meters have a
first digit 1 and very few do in inches.
