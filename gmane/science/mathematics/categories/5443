:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The Department of Mathematics at IST offers programs covering a broad
range of topics leading to a Doctoral Degree. Candidates are admitted to
either the Doctoral Program in Mathematics or to the Doctoral Program in
Statistics and Stochastic Processes. They can also choose to pursue
their
PhD degree in one of the international IST collaborations:

     * Joint Doctoral IST-EPFL Initiative in Mathematics;
     * University of Texas at Austin-Portugal PhD Program in
Mathematics;
     * CMU-Portugal ICTI Program in Applied Mathematics.

The Doctoral Programs offer both in depth and in breadth preparation in
Mathematics, and they include basic and advanced courses in analysis,
algebra, logic, geometry, topology, differential equations, dynamical
systems, mathematical-physics, numerical analysis, probability and
statistics, and the theory of computation. Students interested in
Applied
Mathematics can study applications in Physics, Chemistry, Biology,
Finance, Information Systems and Engineering, and have access to courses
in scientific subjects related to their research offered by other
Departments at IST. All students are encouraged to take advantage of the
many research seminars and colloquia offered by the Mathematics
Department. Classes with foreign students enrolled are taught in
English.
Applications for *financial support* are now open.

Information about the program, including how to apply, can be found in
the
web page:
