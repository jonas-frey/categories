Hello everyone.

As in the past two years, we are organizing an Applied Category Theory
conference and an adjoint school.

This year the conference will take place on July 6-10, 2020.
The research part of the school will be held during the week June 29-July
3, 2020. Both activities will take place at MIT <http://web.mit.edu/>.
The applications for the school are now open, the deadline is January 15,
2020.
The mentors and projects are going to be:

    - Michael Johnson, *Categories of Maintainable Relations
    <https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/adjoint-school-act-2020/categorie=
s-of-maintainable-relations/>*
    - Nina Otter, *Diagrammatic and algebraic approaches between persistence
    modules
    <https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/adjoint-school-act-2020/diagramma=
tic-and-algebraic-approaches-between-persistence-modules/>*
    - Valeria de Paiva,* Dialectica categories of Petri nets
    <https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/adjoint-school-act-2020/dialectic=
a-categories-of-petri-nets/>*
    - Michael Shulman, *A practical type theory for symmetric monoidal
    categories
    <https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/adjoint-school-act-2020/a-practic=
al-type-theory-for-symmetric-monoidal-categories/>*

More information can be found at www.appliedcategorytheory.org.

The school is open to anyone, from anywhere in the world, who is interested
in applying category-theoretic methods to problems outside of pure
mathematics. This is emphatically not restricted to math students, but one
should be comfortable working with mathematics. Knowledge of basic
category-theoretic language=E2=80=94the definition of monoidal category for
example=E2=80=94is encouraged.

We will consider advanced undergraduates, PhD students, post-docs, as well
as people working outside of academia. Members of minorities, and of any
groups which are underrepresented in the mathematics and computer science
communities, are especially encouraged to apply.

Sincerely,

The organizers - Carmen Constantin, Eliana Lorch, and Paolo Perrone.
