According to the e-mail I received from Ms. Jones (see below), this is
available only from the UK catalog. So those of us in the US may still
find it worthwhile to go through Amazon, or wait for the possibility
that similar discount may be offered in the US at some point in the
future.

Dear Mr Rao

This discount is only available in the UK catalogues (OUP distributes
and
markets AMS titles in Europe)
but I am making a discretionary exception  for Prof Pratt because of
current
unavailability of this title
in the US.
