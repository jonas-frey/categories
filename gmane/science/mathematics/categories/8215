Perhaps there is a way to make Cole's preprint more widely available?
I am sure that there are many in this list that have shared Richard's
curiosity for several years; myself among them. We would all be
grateful.

Incidentally, it seems relevant to mention Dubuc's JPAA 149 article,
Section 9 there in particular, as a complement to Johnstone's
exposition in his 1977 book.

Mat?as.
