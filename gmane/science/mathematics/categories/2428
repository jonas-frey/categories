I realize categories is not a bulletin board for employment ads, but I
thought some reader of the list might find this one to be of interest. I
checked out the firm---Korn/Ferry International.  Through their FutureStep
subsidiary, they are an executive search firm.  Does this mean category
theorists have made it into the executive ranks?(!)

Based on your interest in Category Theory, I hope you can help me recruit
a mathematician.  We are seeking two Ph.D. level individuals, one with
expertise in CATEGORY THEORY and one with expertise in DISCRETE EVENT
MODELING to join a team of 15 top flight biotech industry mathematical
modelers.  If you have either colleagues or previous students who have
such expertise, who you think may be interested, and who also fit in with
the requirements listed below, I would very much appreciate hearing back
from you -- or you could simply forward this email to the appropriate
individual.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

The group is looking for a few special individuals who can successfully
develop innovative applied mathematics solutions to real-world biology,
chemistry, applied physics, engineering or operations research problems
and translate them into working prototype computer codes. The goal is to
use sophisticated mathematics to solve practical problems and to have a
significant impact on the success of this biotech company.


A PhD in engineering, mathematics, computer science or a physical science
is preferred;  if mathematics or computer science, significant experience
with physical science problems is required.  Industry experience is
extremely desirable.  Candidates with an MS may be considered if there is
extensive industrial experience.


The successful candidates will develop advanced data analysis techniques,
mathematical models and simulators to help optimize performance, increase
efficiency, or carry out failure mode analyses on systems in diverse areas
such as process development, drug R&D, and manufacturing.  Potential
applications include, but are not limited to:  lumped and distributed
parameter (ODE or PDE) continuous simulations; finite-state or petri-based
discrete simulations;  Monte-Carlo stochastic simulations;  nonlinear
parameter estimation, Bayesian estimation and error-in-variable models;
and digital signal processing, including Fourier and wavelet analyses,
filtering and smoothing.


Good programming skills are important and object-oriented programming is
desirable, as is familiarity with the design and query of relational
databases. Experience with software engineering and related tools such as
Rational Rose or Erwin is desirable.  It is important to be able to
understand the underlying architecture of a software system and to be
comfortable developing such architectures.


Good team skills and the ability to learn quickly are essential.  Good
oral and written communication skills are important. Frequent formal
presentations will be required and formal reports documenting concepts and
the delivered proof-of-principle software must be written. A strong
ability to communicate results to those who are neither comfortable nor
familiar with mathematical terminology is necessary.
