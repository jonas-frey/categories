-BACKGROUNDThe
TYPES meetings are a forum to present new and ongoing work in allaspects of
type theory and its applications, especially in formalisedand computer
assisted reasoning and computer programming.The TYPES areas of interest
include, but are not limited to:* foundations of type theory and
constructive mathematics;* applications of type theory;* dependently typed
programming;* industrial uses of type theory technology;* meta-theoretic
studies of type systems;* proof assistants and proof technology;*
automation in computer-assisted reasoning;* links between type theory and
functional programming;* formalizing mathematics using type theory.We
encourage talks proposing new ways of applying type theory. In thespirit of
workshops, talks may be based on newly published papers,work submitted for
publication, but also work in progress.The EUTypes Cost Action CA15123
(eutypes.cs.ru.nl <http://eutypes.cs.ru.nl>) focuses on the same research
topics as TYPES and partially sponsors the TYPES.Conference:Part of the
program is organised under the auspices of EUTypes.INVITED SPEAKERS* Ulrik

February 2020Camera-ready versions of the accepted contributions will be
published in an informal book of abstracts for distribution at the
workshop.POST-PROCEEDINGSSimilarly to TYPES 2011 and TYPES 2013-2019, a
post-proceedings volume is planned in the Leibniz International Proceedings
in Informatics (LIPIcs) series (confirmation pending). Submission to that
