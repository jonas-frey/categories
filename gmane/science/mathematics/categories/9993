Hi Steve, John and everyone,=20

=46rom the perspective of quantum theory there of course is still a =
clear input-output thing going on, as these morphisms are subject to the =
causality of the world in which we live, captured by the symmetric =
monoidal structure that caries that causal structure.  Then the key =
thing is not to be Cartesian i.e. the whole is not the sum of the parts. =
  Parts may even be pure noise while the whole is a sharp state.  In that =
context, compact closure is a beautifiul thing given that, just like =
being Cartesian, it is more a property than it is a structure, due to =
being `maximally wholistic=E2=80=99.

Compactness seems to appear everywhere when you look around in the real =
world, for example in language which is also compact closed if one =
adopts Lambek=E2=80=99s pregroups for the grammar, and then attaching =
meaning to things gives one a thick (non-symmetric) compact closed =
category.  Here, inputs and outputs truly become meaningless it seems. =20=


=E2=80=94

As a pure category theory problem, there is still something interesting =
to be done to better characterise compactness as a property.  We made =
some (admittedly very modest) baby steps here:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00708 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00708>
https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12088 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12088>

I believe that compact closure deserves the same attention as the =
Cartesian structures has gotten, if not more.  The reason to say more is =
that this case is further away from how me (are made to) think, so =
having some maths in place is particularly useful.

=E2=80=94

On a related note, in 2001 I was about to leave Montreal for Oxford, but =
then 9/11 happened, and the planes didn=E2=80=99t go for a while.  A =
number of other people turned out to be in Montreal too those days, =
including Bill Lawvere, and there were some talks at UDM (can=E2=80=99t =
remember if this was because of being stuck, or planned).  Bill Lawvere =
explained then very nicely the `real world motivation=E2=80=99 for many =
of the decissions he made for developing certain parts of Category =
theory, mostly drawn from how to organise society .  That was an =
eye-opener. =20

One typically thinks of computer science as the main domain to drive =
parts of the development of category theory from an applied perspective, =
but some of the fathers of the field clearly also had other real world =
motivations beyond pure mathematics, which makes perfect sense.  =
Category theory deserves to be about the real world, and hence play an =
important role beyond pure maths, just like many other developments in =
math like geometry and analysis.  That=E2=80=99s why some of us started =
with the dedicated ACT conference + school series.

The thing to do now is not to just get category theory about the real =
world, but also into the real world, and that=E2=80=99s not going to =
happen by just writing papers.  The investment hunger seems to be there =
now, so let=E2=80=99s do it!   Personally, I am going to give up part of =
my academic position to do just that.

Cheers, Bob.
