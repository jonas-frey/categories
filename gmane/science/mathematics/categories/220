Michael, where on earth did that piece of contemptible writing
come from.  I never claimed to invent the term monad.  I did
invent the term operad, as a portmanteau of operation and monad.
And I convinced MacLane to change from the silly term `triple'
to `monad' in Categories for the working mathematician.  He is
not here to corroborate, but look at his note on terminology,
page 138 of the second edition: ``The frequent but unfortunate
use of the word `triple' in this sense has achieved a maximum
of needless confusion, what with the conflict with ordered
triple, plus the use of associated terms such as ``triple
derived functor''for functors which are not three times
derived from anything in the world.  Hence the term monad.''

Michael, shame on you!

Peter May
