	      Killam and AARMS Postdoctoral Fellowships
	in Category Theory and the Foundations of Computation,
		Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada

The Category Theory group at Dalhousie University invites applications
for postdoctoral positions.

The successful candidates will participate in the activities of our
group, and will be part of the Atlantic Category Theory Seminar, which
includes faculty, postdocs, and students from Dalhousie University,
Saint Mary's University, and Mount Allison University. See
http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/atcat/.

Postdoc positions are for 2 years, and normally start on or near
September 1, 2008. There are two types of positions that can be
applied for:

 Killam Postdoctoral Fellowships
	      (http://www.dalgrad.dal.ca/killam/kpdf/)
 Note: Ph.D. must have been obtained January 2006 or later.

 AARMS Postdoctoral Fellowships (http://www.aarms.math.ca/pdf/)
 Note: Ph.D. must have been obtained December 2003 or later.

See the respective websites for the full application requirements and
procedures.

To meet internal deadlines, applications for either (or both) types of
position, including three letters of reference, should be sent by
December 17, 2007, to:

 Dr. Karl Dilcher, Chair
 Department of Mathematics and Statistics
 Dalhousie University
 Halifax, Nova Scotia
 Canada, B3H 4H6

We suggest that any candidates applying in category theory or
foundations of computation also contact one of us so that we are aware
of the application.
