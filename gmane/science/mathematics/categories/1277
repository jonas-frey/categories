The Faculty of Computer Science at the Dresden University of Technology,
Germany, offers in the framework of its research programme 
(DFG-Graduiertenkolleg) 

        Specification of discrete processes and systems of processes 
                 by operational models and logics

several 

A. doctoral grants and 
B. postdoctoral grants 

with a duration of three years and two years, respectively, starting from
February 1st, 2000.

In this research programme we consider various formal concepts for studying
processes, in particular, algebraic and category-theoretic models, 
logic-specification, semi-automatic verification of properties, and 
formal concept analysis.

Applicants who have finished their master degree or Ph.D. can apply for
grant A or grant B, respectively, by sending their curriculum vitae, photo, 
list of publications, and two recommendations by professors not later than 
December 2nd, 1999 to 

Dresden University of Technology
