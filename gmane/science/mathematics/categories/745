Well, I am not trying to be snide, but for me, my argument is more
understandable.  But if you prefer to see it in the way you put it, I have
no objection.  A couple more comments.

In 1986 (or, really, 1984), I did not really understand that this argument
was *really* the same argument, just dressed up nicer, using functors
instead of diagrams.  

In 1970, I was fresh from homological algebra.  The construction struck me
(and still does) as reminiscent of the argument you use in showing that if
you have the beginnings of a map from a projective complex to an acyclic
one, you can continue it one more step.  The main difference was that this
was a well-founded poset instead of an inter-indexed chain.  And if anyone
ever wondered why I called these A diagrams and P diagrams, it had nothing
to do with A&P and everything to do with acyclic and projective.  Thus the
embedding theorem is, like many other things I have done, a form of
acyclic models.
