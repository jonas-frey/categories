Faculty position in PL/verification/theorem-proving at Cambridge
[this is roughly analogous to a US tenured associate professor position]
http://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/job/8134/


The University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory is seeking to recruit a
new faculty member at the Lecturer or Senior Lecturer level who can
contribute to research in areas such as (but not limited to) the
following:

    - theoretical foundations of programming
    - programming language design and implementation
    - formal specification and verification of computer systems
    - theorem proving and its application to hardware and software

The ideal candidate will have interests that range from mathematical
theory to practical applications and will demonstrate the potential to
collaborate with Computer Laboratory research students, staff and faculty
across a range of topics.

Notwithstanding the above focus, exceptional candidates from any area of
Computer Science are also encouraged to apply.

It is likely that successful candidates will already have a strong track
record in one or more relevant research areas and already have some
postdoctoral experience. Ideally the candidate will also have experience
of teaching and generating research grant income.
