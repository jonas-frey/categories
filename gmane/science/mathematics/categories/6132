   The Category Theory "Octoberfest" is an annual workshop, traditionally
   held in October, bringing together researchers in category theory and
   its applications.

   This year's meeting will be hosted in the Department of Mathematics
   and Statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.

   There will be an informal welcome reception in the evening of
   October 22. The scientific program starts on October 23, and
   consists of one and a half days of research talks.

Research talks

   If you wish to give a talk, please let us know by sending an email
   to selinger@mathstat.dal.ca, by October 1. Please also send a title
   and abstract to the same address. Time slots are limited, so please
   register early if possible.

Student support

   We encourage participation by graduate students and postdocs at the
   workshop. Students will pay a reduced registration fee. We will also
   be able to provide limited financial support to students and
   postdocs for travel and accommodations; if you are interested in
   this, please email selinger@mathstat.dal.ca by September 20.

   Please also arrange for a brief letter of recommendation from your
   supervisor, to be sent to the same email address by September 20.
   Your supervisor's letter should also state whether you have access
   to funding from other sources, and how much.

Accommodations

   The website contains a list of hotels and bed & breakfasts that we
   recommend, some with special workshop rates. Please book early, as
   availability is limited, particular in the bed & breakfasts.

Registration

   If you would like to attend the meeting, please register by emailing
   selinger@mathstat.dal.ca. There will be a reasonable on-site
   registration fee to cover workshop costs.

Arrival and location

   The workshop will take place in the Chase building on Dalhousie's
   main campus. There will be updated information and maps on the website.
