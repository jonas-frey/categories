  Hi Ellis,

  to push the chemical reaction analogy further, tensoring with an identity
  morphism 1_Y is like having a chemical present that doesn't take part in the
  reaction: it's there are the beginning and end, but doesn't change. But you
  can't take it away (and no, it's not like a catalyst, in that your original
  arrow f was there to begin with), unless perhaps Y has some sort of dual or
  (weak) tensor inverse, and by now the analogy is stretched beyond breaking
  point.

  David
