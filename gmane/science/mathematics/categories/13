CALCO brings together researchers and practitioners to exchange new
results about both traditional and emerging uses of algebras and =20
coalgebras
in computer science.

This is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces
and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic =20
Methods
in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development
Techniques). The first and second CALCO conferences took place 2005 in
Swansea, Wales (http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/calco/index.php), and 2007 in
Bergen, Norway (http://www.ii.uib.no/calco07/).
The second event will take place September 2009 in Udine, Italy.

CALCO 2009 will be preceded by two events on September 6, 2009.

  * CALCO-jnr - a CALCO Young Researchers Workshop dedicated to
    presentations by PhD students and by those who completed
    their doctoral studies within the past few years.

  * CALCO Tools Day - providing the opportunity to give
    system demonstrations. See below for more information.

There are separate submission procedures for the CALCO main conference,
CALCO-jnr and CALCO Tools Day, respectively.

Invited Speakers
------------------
Mai Gehrke (Nijmegen, NL)
Conor McBride (Strathclyde, UK)
Prakash Panangaden (McGill, Canada)
Gordon Plotkin (Edinburgh, UK)

Topics of Interest
------------------
We invite submissions of technical papers that report results of
theoretical work on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the
way these results can support methods and techniques for software
development, as well as experience with the transfer of resulting
technologies into industrial practice. We encourage submissions in
topics included or related to those in the lists below.

  * Abstract models and logics
    - Automata and languages,
    - Categorical semantics,
    - Modal logics,
    - Relational systems,
    - Graph transformation,
    - Term rewriting,
    - Adhesive categories

  * Specialised models and calculi
    - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems,
    - Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed,
      mobile, and context-aware computing,
    - General systems theory and computational models
      (chemical, biological, etc)

  * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
    - Abstract data types,
    - Inductive and coinductive methods,
    - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation),
    - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques,
    - Semantics of programming languages

  * System specification and verification
    - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification,
    - Formal testing and quality assurance,
    - Validation and verification,
    - Generative programming and model-driven development,
    - Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
      hardware/middleware/architectures,
    - Process algebra


Submission Guidelines
---------------------
Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Experience papers
are welcome, but they must clearly present general lessons learned
that would be of interest and benefit to a broad audience of both
researchers and practitioners. As in 2005 and 2007, it is planned to =20
publish
the proceedings in the Springer LNCS series. Final papers will be
no more than 15 pages long in the format specified by Springer. It
is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length
(see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). Submissions that
are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Proofs omitted due
to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.
Both an abstract and the full paper must be submitted by their =20
respective
submission deadlines.

A special issue of the new high-quality open access journal Logical
Methods in Computer Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), consisting of
extended versions of selected papers will be produced after the =20
conference
if there are enough good papers that can be extended and revised to the
standards of this journal.

Location
-------------------------

historical
region of Friuli, Italy. Located between the Adriatic sea and the =20
Alps, close to
Venice, Austria and Slovenia, Udine is a city of Roman origins, funded =20=

by
Emperor Otto in 983. Rich of historical sites, Udine is also famous =20
for its
outstanding wine and culinary traditions.


CALCO Tools Day
---------------
A special day at CALCO'09 is dedicated to tools based on algebraic
and coalgebraic principles. These include systems/prototypes/tools
developed specifically for design, checking, execution, and verification
of (co)algebraic specifications, but also tools targeting different
application domains but making core or interesting use of (co)algebraic
techniques. Tool submissions should be no longer than 5 pages in the
LNCS format; the accepted tool papers will be included in the final
LNCS proceedings of the conference.  The tools should be available on
the web for download and evaluation. Each submission will be evaluated
by at least three reviewers; one or more of the reviewers will be asked
to download and run the tool. At least one of the authors of each tool
paper must attend the conference to demo the tool.
Submissions by e-mail to grosu@cs.uiuc.edu.

Important Dates (all in 2009)
February 24      Tools software and paper submissions due
March 28         Author notification
