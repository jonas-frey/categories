The situation is actually quite neat. Suppose that, for each category C
in Cat, one chooses a skeleton C_0, and isomorphisms from each object to
the choice of the skeletal object, as you say. Then, indeed, the
operation Skel : Cat -> Cat which sends each category to its chosen
skeleton can be made into a (necessarily weak, but thats the interesting
part) 2-functor, and can can be extended to an equivalence of 2-categories.

Its a special case of a more general notion :  if you have a 2-category
X, such that every object A in X has an associated object A' and an
adjoint equivalence between A and A', then the operation T : X -> X,
which (on objects) sends A to A', is in fact a weak 2-functor, and
indeed a 2-equivalence. Its all rather nice if you draw it out in string
diagrams.

A category "is skeletal" if for each isomorphism A --> B the objects
A and B are the same object (A = B). With this in mind, the phrase
"and only one" in Golblatt's quoted definition is superfluous, being
a consequence of (rather than a condition required for) the definition.

Once one has a _choice_ of isomorphism from each object of C to the
(unique) object of a skeleton of C that it's isomorphic to
(but it may take the axiom of choice to be assured of such an iso), any
two skeleta of C become isomorphic to each other. There's no inherent
"order" among the various possible skeleta of C.

Data making the inclusion into C of any full subcategory that is a
skeleton of C an equivalence of categories IS precisely
such a "choice of isomorphism from each object of C to the
(unique) object of a skeleton of C that it's isomorphic to"
mentioned above.

There's little hope of skel becoming a functor without data of the sort
just mentioned. Probably the strong temptation to "wish" that the full
inclusion {SKEL} --> {CAT} (of the
full subcategory of skeletal categories among all categories)
were an equivalence of categories, or at least the inclusion of a full
reflexive subcategory (with skel as inverse, or at least, reflection
back down), is one to be steer clear of, if at all possible, in general.
