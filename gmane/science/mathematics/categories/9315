Dear Marta, dear=C2=A0friends and colleagues,


Dear Barbara,=E2=80=8B

Fatima joins me in sending you=C2=A0our heartfelt condolences=C2=A0for your=
  great loss.=C2=A0

Our thoughts are with you.

=C2=A0

It is with deep sadness and regret that I learned about Fred=E2=80=99s pass=
ing.

=C2=A0

I always enjoyed his uniquely lively lectures that had a musical rhythm=C2=
=A0and showed so
much enthusiasm and passion that left us inspired.

=C2=A0

For many decades Fred has been my=C2=A0dear friend.

He was the first person whom I encountered when I arrived at Columbia=C2=A0=
University, (in
the early days of=C2=A0

the 60=E2=80=99s). He showed me the way to=C2=A0Eilenberg=E2=80=99s office.=
  Later he guided me to my
introduction to several

facets of category theory. I was a novice and I very much appreciated=C2=A0=
his kindness,
his warmth, and his friendship.

=C2=A0

In a Columbia class that we both attended, he pointed out the relation=C2=
=A0between
adjoint functors and free algebras.=C2=A0 Later he=C2=A0extended that relat=
ionship to algebras
with infinitary operations. He=C2=A0emphasized the mutual relevance of func=
tional analysis
and category

theory; (each still has much to teach the other) =C2=A0and I know that=C2=
=A0Fred=E2=80=99s guidance
will continue to play a role.

=C2=A0

I loved the wide-ranging discussions, when we met for the last time=C2=A0in=
  Warsaw for
Eilenberg=E2=80=99s 100th Birthday, and further on the phone just=C2=A0a fe=
w months ago.

=C2=A0

I will miss him very much.=C2=A0

=C2=A0
