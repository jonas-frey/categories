ANNOUNCEMENT

CATEGORY THEORY SYMPOSIUM
A special session of the Canadian Mathematical Society Summer 1998 Meeting

June 13-15, 1998

University of New Brunswick (Saint John)

The symposium follows the usual format found at society meetings in 
North America. Thus it is part of a larger programme including plenary

larger programme also features a public lecture by F.W. Lawvere (SUNY
Buffalo).

The invited speakers for the Category Theory Symposium are M. Barr
(McGill), M. Bunge (McGill), P. Freyd (Pennsylvania), A.Joyal (UQAM),

R. Pare (Dalhousie), J.W. Pelletier (York), S. Schanuel (SUNY Buffalo),
M. Tierney (Rutgers), W. Tholen (York), and R.F.C. Walters (Sydney).

Registration for the meeting, including fees, is handled by the Canadian
Mathematical Society (CMS). A pre-registration form can be obtained by
