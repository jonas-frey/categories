Eduard Cech center had been established in 2005 and, since 2012,
it continues as the national research center focusing its
attention to interactions between algebra, geometry, and
mathematical physics. The participating institutions are Faculty
of Science of Masaryk University in Brno, Faculty of Mathematics
and Physics of the Charles University in Prague, Institute
of Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and
the Mathematics Institute of the Silesian University in Opava
(see http://eci.sci.muni.cz).

The Center invites applications for several research positions
commencing during the academic year 2012/2013 at the date depending
on mutual agreement. The positions are initially for one year with
a possibility of extension. The candidates must be recent PhD's
and should submit a letter of application accompanied by a CV,
list of publications and an outline of their research project
to Jiri Rosicky (rosicky@math.muni.cz) not later than
May 15, 2012. They should also arrange for at least
2 letters of recommendation (one can be from a Czech mathematician)
to be mailed directly to rosicky@math.muni.cz before May 15,
2012. The successful applicants will be notified as soon as
possible but not later than June 30, 2012.
