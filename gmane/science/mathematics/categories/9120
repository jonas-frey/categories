Dear Jean, (apologies for this, and any future, slow replies. The
necessities of life take up a lot of my time at the moment)

My approach below is pedestrian, but I hope clear.

Strict inverters are PIE-limits. Thus they can be computed in Cat(S)
once we know it has each of products, inserters, equifers -- in fact
just the latter two, in a rather straightforward way, using no more
than two of each. To quote the nLab, "first we insert a 2-morphism
b going in the opposite direction from a, then we equify ba and ab
with identities." (this quote may be likewise borrowed from either
Kelly or Street)

Let as assume S has finite limits throughout.  For what it's worth,
products obviously exist in Cat(S).

Note that For X a category in S, and a subobject U >--> Obj(X), we can
build the full subcategory X[U] of X on U (as an object of Cat(S))
using only finite limits in S. To build the equifer of a,b: f =3D> g: X
--> Y, we only need the equaliser E in S of the component maps a,b:
Obj(X) --> Arr(Y), and then the equifer is the inclusion  X[E] --> X
of the full subcategory on the subobject E.

Thus we are reduced to building inserters, which is the real meat of
the problem, as inserters are not equivalent to any conical 2-limit.

Consider a diagram f,g: X --> Y in Cat(S). The inserter of this
diagram is (the inclusion of) a subcategory Ins(f,g) of X. We can
compute the object Ins(f,g)_0 of objects of the inserter as the
pullback of

Obj(X) -- (f,g) --> Obj(Y) x Obj(Y) <---- (s,t) ---- Arr(Y)

in S.

Then the inserter is a wide subcategory of X[ Ins(f,g)_0 ] (itself a
full subcategory of X). Note that there is a map a: Ins(f,g)_0 --->
Arr(Y) which will be the component map of the universal natural
transformation we are inserting.

The arrows of Ins(f,g) are the largest subobject Ins(f,g)_1 --> Arr(X)
such that a is natural with respect to such arrows. This can be
defined by an equaliser in S.

Thus we can construct, using solely finite limits in S, (products,)
equifiers and inserters, and hence inverters, in Cat(S).

One could perhaps examine this proof more closely to see what kind of
internal categories in non-finitely-complete S are necessary for it to
work (eg those such that (s,t) belong to a class of which all
pullbacks exist, and are again in the class etc). This perhaps would
fit with your general philosophy on generalising fibration technology.

I hope this answers your qualms, and apologies for being slightly
telegraphic in my description.

Best regards,

David

PS I regret we did not have the chance to meet at Topos =C3=A0 l'IH=C3=89S =
in
2015. Perhaps one day...
