                   The 13th International Symposium
                  on Database Programming Languages
            http://www.cs.cornell.edu/conferences/dbpl2011
                       Seattle, Washington, USA
                           August 29, 2011
                      co-located with VLDB 2011

                             Call for Papers

For over 20 years, DBPL has established itself as the principal venue
for publishing and discussing new ideas at the intersection of
databases and programming languages. Many key contributions in query
languages for object-oriented data, persistent databases, nested
relational data, semistructured data, as well as fundamental ideas in
types for query languages were first announced at DBPL. Today, the
emergence of new data management applications such as Semantic Web and
Web services, XML processing, Social and Sensor Networks, Cloud
Computing and Peer-to-peer data management has lead to a new flurry of
creative research in this area. DBPL is an established destination for
such new ideas.

-----
SCOPE
-----

DBPL solicits theoretical and practical papers in all areas of
Database Programming Languages. Papers emphasizing new topics or
foundations of emerging areas are especially welcome. Suggested, but
not exclusive, topics of interest for submissions include:

* Data Exchange
* Data Integration and Interoperability
* Databases and Information Retrieval
* Databases and the Semantic Web
* Databases and Social Networking
* Databases and Cloud Computing
* Databases in Bioinformatics
* Databases in Computational Linguistics
* Declarative Data Centers
* Dependent Type Systems
* Information-Flow Type Systems
* Uncertain and Imprecise Information
* Language-Integrated Query Mechanisms
* Language Support for Databases
* Databases in E-commerce
* Multimedia Databases
* Peer-to-peer Data Management
* Provenance
* Stream Data Processing
* Schema Mappings
* Metadata Management
* Security in Data Management
* Semi-structured Data
* Spatial and Temporal data
* Transaction Management
* Validation, Type-checking
* Web Services
* XML Processing

-----------------
AUTHOR GUIDELINES
-----------------

Prospective authors are invited to submit papers in English presenting
original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not
submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions should be no more
than 6 pages long in the standard ACM SIG proceedings format with two
columns and a nine-point font on a ten-point baseline.

Each submission should begin with a succinct statement of the problem
and a summary of the main results. If the authors believe more details
are necessary to substantiate the main claims of the paper, they may
include a clearly marked appendix to be read at the discretion of the
committee. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the
symposium to present their work.

Papers must be submitted online at the following URL:

  https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/DBPL2011/Default.aspx

---------------
IMPORTANT DATES
---------------

Submission         : June 8, 2011 (11:59pm EDT)
Notification       : July 16, 2011
Final versions due : August 15, 2011
Symposium          : August 29, 2011

-----------
PROCEEDINGS
-----------

Accepted papers will appear in an informal proceedings, which will be
distributed electronically from the symposium website. Appearance is
not intended to preclude later publication at another conference.
