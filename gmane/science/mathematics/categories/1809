At the risk of offering my head on a tray, I will make a stab at some of
this.

Any two products are uniquely isomorphic in a way that preserves the
projections in the obvious way.  That is all that need be said.  There are
coherence statements that can be made, but they follow from the above and
are unnecessary.

The product is the product of the set {A,B}, which is equal to the set
{B,A}, but our orthography forces us to write one or the other.  Of
course, a product is really defined for {A_i|i in I} and is inherently
unordered.  In set theory, the usual A x B is quite a different set from B
x A and in category theory they are indistinguishable.  You seem to
consider that a disadvantage to category theory, but I consider it an
advantage.

Our familiar categories have regular generators and for them the product
condition can be reduced to the universal mapping condition when the
domain is/are the generator(s), which is local.  On the other hand, check
out the product in the category of affine schemes that is really
comprehensible only in terms of the categorical definition.

For another example, consider the traditional definition of Z as the set
{0,{0},{0,{0}},{0,{0}{0,{0}}},...}
and contrast that to the categorical specification.
