Dear Vaughan,

The Zariski topology on the prime spectrum is normally not T1.

In fact Hochster showed that any spectral space (the ones that
correspond to ordered Stone spaces in the Priestly duality) is
homeomorphic to the prime spectrum of some ring, with its Zariski
topology. In particular, this holds for Scott domains and some other
classes of spaces commonly arising in denotational semantics - though it
would be eccentric to treat them as spectra of rings.

Referring to the Wikipedia page on Zariski topology, the "classical"
definition gives a T1 topology,  but the "modern" definition adds extra
"generic" points corresponding to non-maximal prime ideals and they
create a non-discrete specialization order, T0 but not T1.

Regards,

Steve.
