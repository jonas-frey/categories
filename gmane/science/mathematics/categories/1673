the recursion schema, as defined by godel in 1930, is a bit  stronger: g is
allowed to depend on n, not only on f(n).

in a topos, this principle is equivalent with the above schema. and the
schema itself, of course, just means that [0,s] : 1+N --> N is initial: any
algebra [c,g] : 1+X --> X induces a unique homomorphism f : N-->X. using the
exponents, we do recursion.

as i said last time, induction and recursion have been in heavy use for so
long, that they really don't leave much space for redefining, even for the
sake of symmetry with coinduction and corecursion.
