Google's not a perfect metric for popularity, but it returns about 350
hits for "semigroupoid", about 10 for "fair category", and none for
"near category" (the one hit it returns is spurious). Wikipedia has an
entry for "semigroupoid" (with the definition you're thinking of) and
nothing on any of the others. Looking at MathSciNet, we find 180 hits
for "semigroupoid", none for "fair category", and one for "near
category". It's worse than that, though, because that paper uses "near
category" to mean something different, namely a category-like object
with identities but without associativity!

All this suggests to me that "semigroupoid" is the standard term, and
certainly it's the only one I've ever heard before. I don't think you
need to worry about implied invertibility: if you know what both a
groupoid and a semigroup are, the term "semigroupoid" strongly suggests
a multi-object structure with associatively-composable arrows, but not
necessarily with identities. At least, it suggests that to me :-)

Hope that helps,

Miles
