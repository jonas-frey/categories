I do not have a reference, but I think these are precisely the complete boo=
lean algebras.

Glue two copies of the locale X along an open subset U, and call the result=
  Y. Then Y can be seen as an object of Sh(X). The intersection of the two c=
opies of X inside Y is equal to U (from one of Giraud's axioms).

On the other hand, we can write Y as a sum of open subsets of X (the "terms=
" of Y). And we can similarly write X as a sum of open subsets ("terms") su=
ch that each term of X gets mapped into a term of Y. Now we can compute U a=
s the sum of those terms of X that are mapped to the same term of Y along t=
he two inclusions in Y. The disjoint union of the other terms of X then for=
m the complement of U.

Best regards,
Jens

To: <categories@mta.ca<mailto:categories@mta.ca>>


Toposes Sh(B) of sheaves over a cBa B have the property that every object
appears as sum of subterminals. Does any one know a more elementary
characterization of those cHa's A such that every object of Sh(A) appears
as sum of subterminals?
Maybe it is precisely the cBa's but I do not see how to prove it...
