Just to point out that "assuming W-types" here is no extra assumption.
Moerdijk and Palmgren observe that every elementary topos with nno
has W-types. This observation more than answers Schroeder's
original question affirmatively. See Moerdijk and Palmgren,
"Well-founded trees in categories", APAL 104, 2000, for the
observation. I'm not sure whether they include the details (I
don't have the paper to hand), but it's not a hard exercise.
