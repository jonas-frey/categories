It seems that the following is in fact true:

Let p: E ----> B be a fibration. If B is cartesian closed, each fibre is
cartesian closed with exponents stable under pullback, and Pi's exist
along product projections (and satisfy BCC), then E is cartesian closed.

The product of (a, phi) with (b, psi) in E is of course (a x b,
pi_1^*(phi) x pi_2^*(psi)) with pi_1 : a <--- a x b ----> b : pi_2 the
product projections in B.

The internal hom [(b, psi), (c, gamma)] is Pi_{pi_1} [pi_2^*(psi),
ev^*(theta)], where pi_1 : [b,c] <---- [b,c] x b ----> b : pi_2 and=20
ev: [b,c] x b ----> c in B.

This in particular applies to Cat//=E2=80=99Set=E2=80=99 as in Ross' messag=
e, seen as a
fibration over Cat with reindexing along f:A--->B given by
[f,1]:[B,Set]--->[A,Set]. This fibration has right adjoints to
pullbacks, but they don't satisfy BCC; however, right adjoints to
pullback along product projections are given just by (conical) limit
functors, and these do satisfy BCC. So the preceding construction
applies (and a bit of fiddling about shows that this does indeed agree
with Ross' prescription).

As for local cartesian closure: if B is lccc, each fibre is lccc with
fibrewise Pi's stable under pullback, and E--->B has all products, then
it seems that each slice fibration p/A: E/A--->B/pA will satisfy the
conditions in the second paragraph, whence E is also lccc.
