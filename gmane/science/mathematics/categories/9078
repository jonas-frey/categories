                    CALL FOR PAPERS

              The 14th International Conference on
               Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)

                     July 3-7, 2017
       Radboud Universiteit, Nijmegen, Netherlands

                   http://qpl.cs.ru.nl


The 14th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)
will take place at Radboud University between Monday 3 and
Friday 7 July, 2017.

The conference brings together researchers working on mathematical
foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and related areas,
with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical tools,
ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages,
semantical methods, and other computer science techniques applied to
the study of physical behaviour in general. Work that applies
structures and methods inspired by quantum theory to other fields
(including computer science) is also welcome.

Previous QPL events were held in Glasgow (2016), Oxford (2015),
Kyoto (2014), Barcelona (2013), Brussels (2012), Nijmegen (2011),
Oxford (2010), Oxford (2009), Reykjavik (2008), Oxford (2006),
Chicago (2005), Turku (2004), and Ottawa (2003).


INVITED SPEAKERS

Jamie Vicary
Miguel Navasques
Matthias Christandl
Paulo Perinotti


INVITED TUTORIALS

Bart Jacobs (effectus theory)
Dan Marsden (categorical string diagrams)
Ronald de Wolf (quantum algorithms)
Simon Perdrix (TBC)


SATELLITES

There will be a satellite workshop on Quantum Structures hosted by
the International Quantum Structures Association (IQSA) from
Tuesday July 4th to Friday the 7th. Look out for details on the
QPL website and via an official announcement later this year!


IMPORTANT DATES

Submission: 21 April, 2017
Notification: 29 May
Papers ready: 23 June
Conference: 3-7 July



SUBMISSIONS

Prospective speakers are invited to submit a contribution to the
conference.

  - Original contributions consist of a 5-12 page extended abstract
    which provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest
    and enough detail to allow the program committee to assess the
    merits of the work. Submission of substantial albeit partial
    results of work in progress is encouraged. Authors of accepted
    papers will be invited to give long or short talks, depending on
    the quality and/or maturity of the submission.

  - Extended abstracts describing work submitted/published elsewhere
    will also be considered, provided the work is recent and relevant
    to the conference. These consist of a 3 page description and should
    include a link to a separate published paper or preprint.


Extended versions of accepted original research contributions will be
published in Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science
(EPTCS) after the conference.

Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX, and must be submitted
in PDF format. Use of the EPTCS style is encouraged. Submission is
done via EasyChair:

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qpl2017

There will be an award for the best paper whose authors are all
students, at the discretion of the programme committee.


REGISTRATION

Registration will be opened later, please visit the website for more
details.
