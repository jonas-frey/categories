Dear John, Eduardo and Simon,=0A=
=0A=
A few comments and questions.=0A=
=0A=
If G is a connected localic group, then every continuous action of G on a s=
et is trivial.=0A=
Hence the topos of G-sets contains no information about G.=0A=
This is annoying.=0A=
Of course, we could replace G-sets by G-locales (=3D actions of G on locale=
s). =0A=
But the category of G-locales is not a topos in general.=0A=
Should we consider the gross-topos of sheaves on the category of G-locales =
?=0A=
What should be the Grothendieck topology?=0A=
What are the applications ?=0A=
(the applications may guide the developement of a theory).=0A=
=0A=
I do not have a satisfactory answer to these questions .=0A=
=0A=
Remark: There are plenty of connected Lie groups.=0A=
Equivariant homotopy theory is an important branch of topology.=0A=

You are considering the topos T of equivariant G-sheaves on a localic group=
oid G.=0A=
In the case where G is a group, T is the topos of continuous G-sets.=0A=

Under which conditions is the category of sheaves on G a connected Grothend=

Dear Categorists -=0A=
=0A=
Joyal and Tierney proved that any Grothendieck topos is equivalent to the=
=0A=
category of sheaves on a localic groupoid.   I gather that we can take this=
=0A=
localic groupoid to have a single object iff the Grothendieck topos is=0A=
connected, atomic, and has a point.     In this case the topos can also be=
=0A=
seen as the category of continuous actions of a localic group on (discrete)=
=0A=
sets.=0A=
=0A=
I'm curious about how these three conditions combine to get the job done.=
=0A=
So suppose G is a localic groupoid.=0A=
=0A=
Under which conditions is the category of sheaves on G a connected=0A=
Grothendieck topos?=0A=
=0A=
Under which conditions is the category of  sheaves on G an atomic=0A=
Grothendieck topos?=0A=
=0A=
Under which conditions is the category of sheaves on G a Grothendieck topos=
=0A=
with a point?=0A=
=0A=
(Maybe we should interpret "with a point" as an extra structure on G rather=
=0A=
than a mere extra property; I don't know how much this matters.)=0A=
