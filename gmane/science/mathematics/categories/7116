Open academic position at the Department of
Mathematics of ULB in Algebra and Geometry


Description


The Faculty of Sciences of the Universit=E9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) =20
announces the
opening of a full-time academic position in the Department of =20
Mathematics starting
October 1, 2012.

The selected candidate will join a research team whose interests =20
include the
following areas: quantum groups, non-commutative geometry, categorical =20=

algebra,
algebraic combinatorics, convex and discrete geometry, incidence =20
geometry.

Candidates are expected to lead high quality teaching and research =20
programmes in
algebra and/or geometry.

All applicants are expected to hold a PhD in Mathematics or related =20
disciplines and
to have a strong record of publications as well as research experience =20=

in the area(s)
of algebra and/or geometry.

The applicants should also have accomplished an international =20
postdoctoral training
of a global duration equivalent to one academic year.

The selected candidate will develop his (her) research activities in =20
the field(s) of
algebra and/or geometry and he/she will progressively be loaded by =20
teaching duties
in order to attain a volume comparable to his/her colleagues =20
(typically 120 hours of
classes per year). This position in the academic staff of the =20
Department of
Mathematics implies a participation to the teaching (courses, seminars =20=

and exercise
classes) depending from the College of Mathematics, both at the =20
Bachelor and
Master levels. The teaching duties may be revised regularly and are =20
typically
assigned for renewable periods of five years.

For candidates not fluent in French, a temporary period of teaching in =20=

English may
be granted but it is expected that the candidate will be rapidly able =20=

to teach in French
at all levels.

If the selected candidate is neither already employed by ULB nor =20
employed by the
Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique and working at ULB, he/she =20=

will be
offered a first contract for a duration of three years. The aim of =20
this probation period
is to make sure that the teacher has sufficient pedagogical skills and =20=

is satisfactorily
integrated in the University. At the end of this period and subject to =20=

the agreement of
the Board of the University, the position will become permanent.



How to apply ?

Applications (two copies) should be sent as soon as possible, and =20
before March 1,
2012, to the following address:
