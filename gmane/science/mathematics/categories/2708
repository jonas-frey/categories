CALL FOR PAPERS AND PARTICIPATION:

3rd WORKSHOP ON:
CATEGORICAL METHODS FOR CONCURRENCY,
INTERACTION AND MOBILITY (CMCIM 2004),
AUGUST 11, 2004

affiliated with the 10th conference in Category Theory and Computer =20
Science (CTCS 2004) ,August 12th-14th,
and Graduate Student Summer School in Category Theory and Computer =20
Science, August 9th-11th.

IT University of Copenhagen (ITU)
Copenhagen, Denmark

Important Dates:

* June 21st, 2001:  Submission of abstracts for CMCIM Workshop
* July 1st, 2004:  CTCS Registration (and special hotel rates) deadline

------------------------------------------------------------------------=20=

----

Just before the CTCS 2004 conference, August 11th, there will be an =20
informal
half-day workshop on Categorical Methods in Concurrency, Interaction =20
and Mobility.

The workshop has previously been held in connection with CONCUR 2002 =20
and CONCUR 2003.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts (less than 5 pages), =20
presenting status reports,
recent results, challenges or work in progress.

There will be no formal proceedings of the workshop, informal =20
proceedings will be distributed at the workshop.
Thus, accepted material may be published elsewhere at a later date.

Topics of interest include:

    =95      categorical algebras of processes
    =95      categorical methods in game semantics and geometry of =
interaction
    =95      categorical models of term/graph rewriting or rewriting =
logic
    =95      Chu spaces
    =95      coalgebras, bialgebras, coinduction
    =95      comparing models of concurrency
    =95      enriched categories of processes
    =95      interaction categories
    =95      bigraphs
    =95      presheaf semantics

Workshop participation is free, but requires registration before 1st of =20=

July, by sending an email to hilde@itu.dk, containing =20
`CMCIM2004-registration' in the subject, and your full name and =20
affiliation in the body.

Submissions should be sent before 21th of June, as PostScript files to: =20=

hilde@itu.dk, containing `CMCIM-submission' in the subject, and in the =20=

body the full names of the author(s), title, and a text-only abstract.
