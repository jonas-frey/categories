Dear Nick and Tom,

Thank you very much for your replies. It is very helpful.

I had in mind to form a tricategory of bicategories, therefore I guess
I was talking of what Tom calls strong transformations. They are also
called weak??? I am a bit confused by the lax, weak, pseudo, strict
and so on terminology in higher category theory. Nick, could you
confirm that you were talking of strong transformations in your mail?
Now I am not sure anymore what are natural transformations in category
theory. They are strict transformations, right?

Unfortunately, I do not have a copy of the paper "Coherence for
tricategories" by Gordon, Power and Street. I guess such reference
would help me a lot with such questions.

I have another question. For strong and strict (and maybe lax?)
transformations, we have the interchange law relating vertical and
horizontal composition.  What is the equivalent of interchange law for
compositions of modifications?

Thank you,

David
