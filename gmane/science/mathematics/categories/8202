Dear all,=20

It has recently been pointed out to me by a referee that two =
constructions of which I make use (among which a 2-dimensional =
Grothendieck construction) were special cases of comma 2-categories. The =
references given in the rapport are sections 1.2.5 of Gray's "Formal =
category theory" and section 4 of Kelly's "On clubs and doctrines". The =
first one deals with strict 2-functors whereas the second one limits =
itself to lax functors whose domains are categories.=20

Are there other references dealing with more general cases? In any case, =
what are other references spelling out functoriality properties? (There =
are some in these two texts and I could work out what I need, but the =
more references the better.)=20

Thanks. (And thanks to the referee, whom I am not supposed to contact =
directly.)

Jonathan=
