Dear Eduardo,

I have written papers that deliberately have two possible meanings: one
classical point-set and one constructive point-free.

That is to say, the development in terms of points is done under logical
(geometric) constraints that enable it to be interpreted in topos-valid
point-free topology (locales), but it can be interpreted directly in
point-set topology if one accepts classical logic.

I did this for expositional reasons, to help classical topologists
understand the topological content of what I was doing.

See:

   "Localic completion of generalized metric spaces I"
   "The connected Vietoris powelocale"

Is this compatible with what you were saying about "only one possible
meaning"?

Regards,

Steve Vickers.
