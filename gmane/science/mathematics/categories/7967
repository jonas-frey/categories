Thanks, all for your responses so far; many of you have asked what my
motivation was for the question.  I'm trying to understand pi
calculus.  I've got a bicategorical model of a fragment of pi calculus
where prefixing is composition, but in order to prevent reduction
under a prefix, the remainder of the term needs to be suspended; one
way to do that is to treat it as "source code" and evaluate it in an
environment with bindings, thus my question.
