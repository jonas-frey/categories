The list is too restrictive. I would like to expand it further:

1) Algebraic topology and homological algebra
2) Abelian categories
3) Algebraic geometry and topos theory=20
4) General cartesian algebra
5) Categorical logic
6) Homotopical algebra
7) Elementary topos theory and set theory
8) Monoidal categories and enriched category theory
9) General tensor algebra and coalgebra
10) Category theory and computer science
11) Quantum field theory
12) Higher categories and homotopy theory =20

Algebraic theories and limit sketches are included in (4).
Multicategories, operads are included in (9).

I have included Quillen homotopical algebra in (6).

Like most fields of mathematics, category theory keeps growing and =
evolving.=20
It may be hard to identify the mechanism of this evolution=20
but fashion must be playing a role.
But why are certain subjects becoming hot at a given time?
Probably because they resonate with new developments outside category =
theory.
When a trend becomes hot, it gives rise to a permanent current.=20
I was able to distinguish approximatly 6 major currents:

1) Algebraic topology and homological algebra

2) Abelian categories

3) Algebraic Geometry and topos theory=20

4) Logic and elementary topos theory

5) Category theory and computer science

6) Higher categories with homotopy theory =20

Here is an example of a recent applications of category theory to =
geometry:

"Associahedral categories, particles and Morse functor"=20
by Jean-Yves Welschinger http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4712=20

The n-category caff=E9 is an extraordinary experiment in=20
research collaboration and dissimination of knowledge.
It maybe the way of the future.
But an old mathematicians like me find it=20
difficult to adapt to this new form of collaboration.=20

Yep! And we should not remain passive.
