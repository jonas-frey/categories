  Postdoc Positions on Proof Theory in Paris
--------------------------------------------------------

I am pleased to announce the opening of a postdoc position
which is financed by the ANR within the project INFER
<http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~lutz/orgs/infer.html>

This project is a grouping of three teams through their common
interest for a new approach to proof theory, called deep inference,
that has been developed during the last seven years. We aim at
refining its enormous potential and at applying it to problems related
to the foundations of logic and to more practical questions in the
algorithmics of deductive systems.

The working place of the postdoc will be in the suburbs of Paris at
the Ecole Polytechnique which is one of the "Grand Ecoles" in the
French education system.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent in computer science or
mathematics, and should have a strong background in proof theory
and/or related topics. The principal responsibility of the postdoc
will be to carry out research in the area of deep inference. There are
no teaching duties.

For more information, please contact:
    Lutz Strassburger <lutz@lix.polytechnique.fr>

Applications should be sent via email to Lutz Strassburger
<lutz@lix.polytechnique.fr>, and should include a CV, a short research
proposal (1-2 pages), and one or two recommendation letters. The
position is open now, and applications are considered until the
position is filled.

Furthermore, I'd like to draw the attention to an INRIA postdoc offer
on a related topic:
http://www.talentsplace.com/syndication1/inria/ukpostdoc/details.html?id=PNGFK026203F3VBQB6G68LOE1&LOV5=4508&LOV2=4493&LOV6=4514&LG=EN&Resultsperpage=20&nPostingID=1124&nPostingTargetID=3132&option=52&sort=DESC&nDepartmentID=19

For this applications have to made online via the INRIA
webpage (deadline 31 March). Nonetheless, potential applicants
should contact me via email.

Best regards,
Lutz Strassburger
