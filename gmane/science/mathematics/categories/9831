THIRD SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 3)
2nd Call For Papers

University of Oxford
27-28 March, 2019
http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/syco/3/ <http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/syco/3/>

The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an
interdisciplinary series of meetings aiming to support the growing
community of researchers interested in the phenomenon of
compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives, and in
particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language.
The first SYCO was in September 2018 at the University of Birmingham.=20
The second SYCO was in December 2019, at the University of Strathclyde,=20
each attracting about 70 people.=20

We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science,
mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of
fostering friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading
knowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature
research and work in progress, and by both established academics and
junior researchers, including students.


Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions.
The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even
if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. Think
creatively---you could submit a recent paper, or notes on work in
progress, or even a recent Masters or PhD thesis.

While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions
with a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in
particular from the perspective of category theory:

- logical methods in computer science, including classical and
quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language
processing and machine learning;

- graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and
reaction networks;

- languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets,
type theory and game semantics;

- abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal
category theory, higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and
relationships to homotopy theory;

- quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation theory;

- tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof
assistants, and game theory;

- industrial applications, including case studies and real-world
problem descriptions.

This new series aims to bring together the communities behind many
previous successful events which have taken place over the last
decade, including "Categories, Logic and Physics", "Categories, Logic
and Physics (Scotland)", "Higher-Dimensional Rewriting and
Applications", "String Diagrams in Computation, Logic and Physics",
"Applied Category Theory", "Simons Workshop on Compositionality", and
the "Peripatetic Seminar in Sheaves and Logic".

SYCO will be a regular fixture in the academic calendar, running
regularly throughout the year, and becoming over time a recognized
venue for presentation and discussion of results in an informal and
friendly atmosphere. To help create this community, and to avoid the
need to make difficult choices between strong submissions, in the
event that more good-quality submissions are received than can be
accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose to
*defer* some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject them.
This would be done based largely on submission order, giving an
incentive for early submission, but would also take into account other
requirements, such as ensuring a broad scientific programme. Deferred
submissions can be re-submitted to any future SYCO meeting, where they
would not need peer review, and where they would be prioritised for
inclusion in the programme. This will allow us to ensure that speakers
have enough time to present their ideas, without creating an
unnecessarily competitive reviewing process. Meetings will be held
sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.

# INVITED SPEAKERS

Marie Kerjean, INRIA Bretagne Atlantique
Alessandra Palmigiano, Delft University of Technology and University of Joha=
nnesburg


# IMPORTANT DATES

All times are anywhere-on-earth.

- Submission deadline: Friday 15 February 2019
- Author notification: Wednesday 27 February 2019
- Registration deadline: Wednesday 20 March 2019
- Symposium dates: Wednesday 27 and Thursday 28 March 2019

# SUBMISSIONS

Submission is by EasyChair, via the following link:

- https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsyco3 <https://easychair.org/con=
ferences/?conf=3Dsyco3>

Submissions should present research results in sufficient detail to
allow them to be properly considered by members of the programme
committee, who will assess papers with regards to significance,
clarity, correctness, and scope. We encourage the submission of work
in progress, as well as mature results. There are no proceedings, so
work can be submitted even if it has been previously published, or has
been submitted for consideration elsewhere. There is no specific
formatting requirement, and no page limit, although for long
submissions authors should understand that reviewers may not be able
to read the entire document in detail.

# FINANCIAL SUPPORT

rity for PhD students and junior researchers.=20
