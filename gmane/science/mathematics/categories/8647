Dear Uwe,

there are the notions of properad and prop.  They are successive
generalisations of operads: for operads the composable
configurations are rooted trees; for properads the composable
configurations are directed graphs required to be connected and
acyclic; for props, connectedness is given up.

Note that in all these cases, as well as in the string diagram
calculus for monoidal categories, the edges are the objects, and
the nodes are the operations.  The (1,1)-operations are just
arrows in the sense of categories.  This is in contrast with the
role graphs play as structures underlying categories.

Properads can be described as algebras for a monad on a category
of presheaves on elementary graphs.  Any (directed) hypergraph
defines a presheaf on elementary graphs, and the properad monad
actually restricts to this subcategory: there is a monad for
properads defined on the category of hypergraphs.

The category of directed graphs embeds in two ways into
hypergraphs: one sending edges to hyperedges, and another
sending edges to (1,1)-nodes (and nodes to hyperedges).  Under
this second embedding, the free-properad monad restricts to the
free-category monad!  In this way hypergraphs provide the
smallest setting in which to unify the dual roles played by
graphs (as contrasted above), and in this way I think one can
say that properads provide an answer to your question (unless
I misunderstand it).

All this is explained in my recent paper

    'Graphs, hypergraphs, and properads', arXiv:1407.3744.

Cheers,
Joachim.
