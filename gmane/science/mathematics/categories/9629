 		     FINAL CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                    15th International Conference on
                       Quantum Physics and Logic
                               (QPL 2018)

                             June 3-7, 2018
                            Halifax, Canada

                  https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/qpl2018/

IMPORTANT DEADLINE COMING UP IN 2 DAYS:

*** May 15 *** - early registration deadline.

                                 * * *

The 15th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic
(QPL 2018) will take place at Dalhousie University June 3-7, 2018.

The conference brings together researchers working on mathematical
foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and related areas,
with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical tools,
ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages,
semantical methods, and other computer science techniques applied to
the study of physical behaviour in general. Work that applies
structures and methods inspired by quantum theory to other fields
(including computer science) is also welcome.

QPL 2018 will be co-located with the 34th Conference on the
Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS 2018), which
takes place from June 6-9.

REGISTRATION AND LOCAL INFORMATION

   The early registration deadline is May 15. The registration fees are
   as follows:

   * Regular participants: $100 (QPL only) or $120 (QPL and MFPS).
   * Students: $60 (QPL only) or $80 (QPL and MFPS).
   * After May 15: registration fees increase by $10.

   Please register at http://stay.dal.ca/KxRegistration/QPLMFPS18

   There will be a joint QPL/MFPS conference dinner on Wednesday,
   June 6.  Dinner tickets can be purchased on the registration
   page. You can also buy additional dinner tickets for any guests.

   Please see the conference website for a list of some hotels and
   other accommodation choices.

TRAVEL TO CANADA

   Most foreign nationals now need an electronic travel authorization
   before flying to Canada. This applies to all visa-exempt foreign
   nationals (for example, European citizens). It only costs $7 and can
   be done efficiently at the eTA website (see the conference website
   for a link). The eTA requirement does not apply to U.S. citizens,
   nor to visitors who need an actual visa to travel to Canada.
