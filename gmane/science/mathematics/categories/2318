But this is the heart of the matter.  There is a certain precise sense
in which what happens in a topos between the empty set and a singleton
set governs the behavior of the rest of the topos.  Instead, why not
factor out the topos logic and add whatever nonemptiness assumptions
that are perceived necessary from a practical standpoint as an
additional theory?  This factoring shouldn't affect those that rely on
the non-emptiness assumptions, but it would make a big difference to
those who want to work in the topos logic.
