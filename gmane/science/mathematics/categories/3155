Dear Vaughan,

1. Instead of universal Horn formulas I shall talk about quasiidentities,
which is the same thing in your context. Recall: A quasiidentity is a fir=
st
order formula of the form (P1&...&Pn)=3D>Q, where P1,...,Pn,Q are atomic
formulas (i.e. "equations of terms"). A class of universal algebras is sa=
id
to be a quasivariety if it can be axiomatized with quasiidentities.
Quasivarieties can be characterized as classes of algebras closed under
subalgebras, products, and filtered colimits (the only reason for filtere=
d
colimits is that we want n above to be finite; products and filtered
colimits can be replaced here with filtered products).

2. Since the free monoid on a set X can be considered as a submonoid of t=
he
free group on the same X, the quasivariety of monoids generated by groups
contain all free monoids. In other words, every quasiidentity that holds =
for
all groups, will also hold for all free monoids. That is, asking your
question, forget free monoids!

3. The quasivariety of monoids generated by groups obviously consists
exactly of all those monoids that can be embedded into groups. Hence one
should probably see

Malcev, A. =DCber die Einbettung von assoziativen Systemen in Gruppen.

(Russian) Rec. Math. [Mat. Sbornik] N.S. 8 (50) (1940). 251--264. MR00028=
95
(2,128b)

4. I do not have these papers here in Cape Town. But I seem to remember t=
hat
Mal'tsev had an infinite list of quasi-identities which describes the
quasi-variety of monoids that can be embedded into groups. Furthermore it
seems (I am not sure) that he actually introduced the term "quasiidentity=
"
exactly for this purpose. The first non-trivial one, which he called
Condition Z, was

(as =3D bt) & (cs =3D dt) & (au =3D bv) =3D> (cu =3D dv);

this condition obviously holds in every group and therefore in every
submonoid of a group, but he constructed a semigroup with cancellation in
which it does not hold. (Here the difference between monoids and semigrou=
ps
is irrelevant here). I do not know much did Mal'tsev know about universal
constructions; once Mac Lane told me that Zariski knew them... Knowing th=
em,
one would of course begin by looking at the universal group with a
homomorphism from a given monoid into it, and taking the list of
quasiidentities from the description of the congruence involved in the
construction of that group.

5. Your idea of xy =3D x =3D> y =3D 1 and yx =3D x =3D> y =3D 1 is too ba=
d (sorry!),
because it is even weaker than the usual cancellation

xy =3D xz =3D> y =3D z and yx =3D zx =3D> y =3D z.

For, take the quotient of the free monoid on {x,y} by identifying xx =3D =
xy
(and =3D yx =3D yy if you like); it satisfies your implications but not t=
he
cancellation.

6. In the abelian case (obviously) it is just one quasiidentity, namely t=
he
cancellation. That is, the quasivariety of abelian monoids that can be
embedded into groups is determined by the axiom x + y =3D x + z =3D> y =3D=
 z.
