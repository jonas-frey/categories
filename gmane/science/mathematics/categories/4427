The series of ICDT conferences provides a biennial, international
forum for the communication of research advances on the principles of
database systems. This year, for the first time, ICDT will be held
jointly with EDBT (The 12th International Conference on Extending
Database Technology). ICDT will be on 23-25 March 2009, and EDBT will

Submissions:

Paper submission will be electronic. Authors are required to submit
a paper title and short abstract (about 100 words) before submitting
the paper. The deadline for abstract submissions is August 7, 2008.

Papers should be submitted in LNCS format (style files are available
at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html ) and may not exceed
15 pages. Papers not conforming to the above requirements concerning
format and length may be rejected without further consideration. The
deadline for paper submission is August 14, 2008. Both deadlines are
firm; late submissions will not be considered. Authors will be
notified of acceptance or rejection by November 6, 2008; accepted
papers formatted for the proceedings will be due by December 8, 2008.

Submission website:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdt2009

The first page should include the title of the paper, names and
affiliations of authors, a brief synopsis, and the contact author's
name, address, phone number, fax number, and email address. Papers
must be in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program
committee to assess their merits. They should begin with a succinct
statement of the issues, a summary of the main results, and a brief
explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference,
all phrased for the non-specialist. Technical development directed to
the specialist should follow. References and comparisons with related
work should be included. If the authors believe more details are
necessary to substantiate the main claims of the paper, they may
include a clearly marked appendix to be read at the discretion of
the committee. Submissions departing significantly from these
guidelines risk rejection.

The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or
workshops. All authors of accepted papers will be expected to sign
copyright release forms. One author of each accepted paper will be
expected to present it at the conference.

It is anticipated that the proceedings of the conference will be
published by Springer-Verlag in Lecture Notes in Computer Science.

Awards:

An award will be given to the best paper. Also, an award will be
given to the best paper written by newcomers to the field of
database theory. The latter award will preferentially be given to a
paper written only by students; in that case the award will be called
"Best Student Paper Award". The program committee reserves the
following rights: not to give an award; to split an award among
several papers; and to define the notion of a newcomer. Papers
authored or co-authored by Program Committee members are not eligible
for an award.
