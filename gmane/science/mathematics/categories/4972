***************************************************************
                          ICFEM 2009
  11th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods
                 ***  Call For Papers ***

                    December 9-12, 2009
                  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
              http://icfem09.inf.puc-rio.br
***************************************************************

ICFEM brings together those interested in the application of formal
engineering methods to computer systems. Researchers and
practitioners, from industry, academia, and government, are
encouraged to attend, and to help advance the state of the art. We
are interested in work that has been incorporated into real
production systems, and in theoretical work that promises to bring
practical, tangible benefit.

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to, the
following.

    Formal model-based development and code generation
    Abstraction and refinement
    Specification, verification and validation
    Formal testing approaches
    Integrated methods and theories for different programming paradigms
    Formal methods for object and component systems
    Tool development and integration
    Experiments involving verified systems
    Applications of formal methods

There will be a special track on UML (but in the scope of the ICFEM
remit as described above). ICFEM'09 will have a five-day technical
programme, including two days for tutorials and workshops, and three
days for a conference.

INVITED SPEAKERS

    Manfred Broy, Germany - FME Invited Lecture
    Augusto Sampaio, Brazil

SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be
concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions
will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the
field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the
conference. The proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series. Authors of a selection of the
accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version of
their work to a SPECIAL ISSUE OF SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING.

Papers should be written in English and not exceed 20 pages in LNCS
format (see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html for
details). Papers will be processed through the EasyChair conference
management system. To submit your paper, please visit
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfem09. All queries should
be sent to the e-mail address icfem09@inf.puc-rio.br.
