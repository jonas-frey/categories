Dear Bill,

Indeed, there were no monoids in Vaughan's original message of February 28,
but since you have mentioned them in your message of March 1, and since you
were talking there about "...lacuna of explicitness ... in many papers on
Galois theory...", I simply wanted to say that:

I do not see any relevance of these kinds of presentations in Galois theory
(apart from the fact the internal pre-whatever-s in a category X form an
X-valued presheaf category).

On the other hand Galois theory is not the end of the World, and I think the
beauty and importance of those your ideas is clear to everyone who saw them.

Putting myself in risk of making my message boring, I would like to make one
more remark concerning your last message and Galois theory:

You say: "...applying a non-exact functor F to a group..." - true and fine,
but I have actually mentioned F(R) for R being not a group, but another
extreme case of a groupoid, namely an equivalence relation. What seems to be
most amazing is, that, because F preserves not-all-but-some pullbacks, there
are beautiful examples where R is an equivalence relation and F(R) is a
group; in simple words, F creates a group out of nothing! The classical
example, as you know, is: if R is the kernel pair of a universal covering
map E ---> B of a "good" connected topological space B, and F is the functor
sending ("good") topological spaces to the sets of their connected
components, then F(R) is the fundamental group of B. The same thing is true
in other Galois theories of course.

George
