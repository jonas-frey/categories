Hi Noson,

it might be worthwhile pointing out that it would be interesting to
consider if similar results hold when one works over a foundations
informed by computation, for instance over the effective topos. I
guess this would mean working in the 2-category of fibrations over
Eff, or similar, rather than of bare categories.

Similarly, one could imagine redoing this in HoTT, but I guess one
needs a good model (if one wants to work in a model) for the
(\infty,2)-category of (pre-)categories. This is much more at the
coalface, since the theory is less settled down that the traditional
topos-theoretic/logical approach using realisability etc.

Best regards,

David
