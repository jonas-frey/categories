Right, that's what I meant by "*a* category of presheaves on J" (as
opposed to *the* category of all presheaves on J), the point of my
analogy with Archimedean fields (as opposed to the field of all reals).

Right, just as to get all of the reals one should say that the
Archimedean field is complete.  For situations where one doesn't need
the whole thing it is convenient to be able to characterize the
categorical counterpart of an Archimedean field, with J in place of Q,
as any full, faithful and dense extension of J.  Density serves to keep
the extension inside [J^op,Set], just as it keeps Archimedean fields
inside R.

Am I missing something?  I was thinking that followed from density of J
in C.
