Dear colleagues,

It is a pleasure to announce the workshop

=E2=88=9E-categories and their applications

to be held at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Bonn, Germany on=C2=
=A0August 17-21, 2020.

The quest for solid foundations for =E2=88=9E-categories started several =
decades ago, but from the mid-2000s there have been spectacular developme=
nts which excitingly accelerated the pace of progress. This workshop will=
  focus on these objects, both in their foundations and in the application=
s to different fields of mathematics.

The minicourses are:

Minicourse 1: Models for homotopical higher categories, by Bergner, Julie=
  (University of Virginia) *
Minicourse 2: Introduction to =E2=88=9E-operads by Haugseng, Rune (NTNU)
Minicourse 3: Higher Categories and Algebraic K-Theory by Nikolaus, Thoma=
s (WWU M=C3=BCnster)
Minicourse 4: Exodromy and compactifications of arithmetic schemes by Bar=
wick, Clark (University of Edinburgh)

The plenary speakers are:

Batanin, Michael (Macquarie University, MPIM Bonn) *
Gepner, David (University of Melbourne) *
Guti=C3=A9rrez, Javier (Universitat de Barcelona)
Hackney, Philip (University of Louisiana at Lafayette)
Ozornova, Viktoriya (Ruhr-Universit=C3=A4t Bochum)
Scherotzke, Sarah (University of Luxembourg) *
Schlank, Tomer (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem)
Spitzweck, Markus (Universit=C3=A4t Osnabr=C3=BCck)

* =3D To be confirmed

There will also be time for several contributed talks from early career r=
esearchers.

All interested to come should register via the website=C2=A0

https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/10159

indicating if they would like to contribute a talk and if they need finan=
cial support. We would especially like to encourage women and under-repre=
sented minorities to apply. The deadline for registration is=C2=A0May 31s=
t=C2=A0if you want to contribute a talk or to ask for funding, and=C2=A0A=
ugust 2nd=C2=A0if you just want to participate.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Bonn.

Best,
Hongyi Chu and Bruno Stonek
