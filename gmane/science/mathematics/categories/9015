UNION COLLEGE MATHEMATICS CONFERENCE
Schenectady, New York
Saturday and Sunday
December 3 - 4, 2016

This is the third announcement for the 15th Union College Mathematics
Conference. This year the conference topics are category theory, algebraic
and applied topology, differential geometry, and number theory. In addition
to featured lectures, there will also be shorter contributed talks in
parallel sessions.

WEB PAGE: www.math.union.edu/~toddg/ucc/

SCHEDULE: The conference begins with a welcoming reception and registration
7:30-9:00 Friday evening in Bailey Hall 204. There will also be coffee and
registration Saturday morning 8:00-9:00. Talks will begin on Saturday
morning at 9:00 and continue on Sunday, ending in the afternoon. Please
check the conference web page at the end of November for a more detailed
schedule.

REGISTRATION FEE: There will be a conference fee (cash or check) of $25 for
faculty, $15 for post-docs/retired faculty, and $10 for students.

ABSTRACTS: The abstract deadline is Friday, November 4. If you would like
to give a talk and have not yet submitted an abstract, please contact me
directly (niefiels@union.ed) once the deadline has passed.

ACCOMODATIONS: The deadline has passed to reserve a room in one of the
blocks, but there is still availability at the hotels via the Hilton web
site and at Hotels.com. The Double Tree is the hotel closest to campus,
about a half mile away. Those of you who have been here before may
recognize the location as that of the old Holiday Inn, but the building was
completely renovated when Hilton took over last year. The Hampton Inn in
downtown Schenectady is also walking distance to campus, about a mile away.
If neither of these is available, a new hotel (Marriott Courtyard
Schenectady at Mohawk Harbor) just opened last month at the site of the
future Rivers Casino. It, too, is only a mile from campus but the area is
not yet as developed as the downtown.
