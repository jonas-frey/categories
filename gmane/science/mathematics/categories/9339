I was very sorry to receive the news about Fred.  My deepest sympathy to Ba=
rbara and family, and to all those in the category theory community who wer=
e close to him.


Although I spent the 1966-67 academic year at ETH Zurich, and was then in f=
requent contact with Fred and the other categorists who were at the Forschu=
ngsinstitut that year, my clearest memory of him is still of a very pleasan=
t and interesting conversation we had at the 1965 category theory meeting i=
n La Jolla.  As I recall, it was mostly about 2-categories, in which I was =
very much interested at the time.
