Heraclitus of Ephesus used 'logos' for what is pretty well-known. Even
more known is that 'logos' is in the first sentences of the Gospel of
John. I'm not claiming anybody should care, but using 'logos' for a math
concept must be justified, not for what I mentioned, but for what it is.
What is this discussion really about?

Just wondering.
