Dear all,

We are pleased to announce the next Young Topologists' Meeting that will
take place on July 6-10, 2015 at the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The goal is to bring together graduate students, recent PhDs and young
researchers to give talks concerning their own work. In addition,
there will be two mini-courses:

Emily Riehl (Harvard University): Infinity category theory from scratch,
Gunnar Carlsson (Stanford University): Methods of applied topology.

The registration deadline is 30st April 2015. The registration form and
further information can be found onhttp://gr-he.epfl.ch/ytm2015.

We can provide accomodation for about 70 participants.

We applied for a NSF grant in order to fund about 20 participants from
American universities.
A full application, including recommendation letters and a CV, will be
requested upon positive answer from the NSF.

We encourage women and under-represented minorities to apply.

We hope to see you this summer in Switzerland!

The organizers,

Martina Rovelli,
Kay Werndli,
Dimitri Zaganidis.
