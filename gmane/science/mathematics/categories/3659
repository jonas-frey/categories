1971, not 1982, was when operads were defined.
Certainly I did not know multicategories, but
they only correspond to non-sigma operads,
operads without permutations, and I would not
have bothered inventing a word just for them.
Precisely, multicategories are the many object
version of non-sigma operads.  The point is
that the applications for which operads were
invented depend vitally on the permutations.
