Just to respond to one aspect of this:

I can't speak for others, but I did not intend, in making the suggestion
to base category theory without equality for objects on type theory,
that constructive mathematics be necessarily also adopted.  While many
of the adherents of type theory have a constructive point of view, and
type theory is a natural home for constructive mathematics, type theory
with classical logic is also a perfectly well-defined notion.  Its
type-theoretic properties are not as good as those of the constructive
version, but that's irrelevant for the purposes I had in mind: it can be
used as a language just like the ordinary classical first-order logic in
which classical set theories such as ZFC are formulated.
