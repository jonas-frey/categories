Algebraic geometry defines the affine line over a field k as an affine schem=
e, the spectrum of k[X]. It includes a copy of k, each element a being prese=
nt as the irreducible polynomial X-a, with local ring the ring of fractions g=
ot by inverting polynomials f(X) such that f(a) is non-zero.

You can carry this out for the real line R, but it is very much R as a set, a=
nd the copy of R in the underlying space of the spectrum has the discrete to=
pology.

Does algebraic geometry provide an analogous construction that could lead to=
  the point-free R? Can the locally ringed space be topologized (point-free) s=
o that the copy of R has its usual topology?

I've run into various problems.

1. It is not obvious to me that R[X] exists point-free. By that I mean that,=
  without presupposing a set R[X], or using non-geometric constructions, I ca=
n't see how to define a geometric theory whose models are the polynomials. T=
he problem comes with trying to pin down the requirement that all but finite=
ly many of the coefficients of a polynomial must be zero. You cannot continu=
ously define the degree of a polynomial, because the function R -> N, a |-> d=
egree(aX + 1), is not continuous.

That suggests the construction as Spec(R[X]) might have to be adjusted. Is t=
here still some locally ringed space that does the trick?

2. The "structure sheaf" cannot be a sheaf. We hope its fibres are point-fre=
e local rings, but, whatever they are, they must be R-algebras and so cannot=
  have the discrete topology. The space is locally ringed by some bundle othe=
r than a sheaf (local homeomorphism).

3. The usual local rings, got as rings of fractions as described above, may b=
e problematic point-free in the same way as R[X] is. I don't know what would=
  do instead. The power series ring R[[X]]? (At least as fibre over 0.) It do=
es have the property of inverting those polynomials f for which f(0) is non-=
zero. And it can be defined point-free, as R^N. (However, the finitely prese=
nted approximations R[X|X^n =3D 0] happily exist point-free.)

Thanks for any references you can provide,

Steve.
