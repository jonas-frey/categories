----------------   FIRST CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS    -----------------

                             Workshop on
         Graph Transformation and Visual Modeling Techniques
                   <http://www.di.unipi.it/GT-VMT/>

                         Geneva, Switzerland
                       Saturday July 15, 2000

                   A Satellite Event of ICALP'2000
                    <http://cui.unige.ch/~icalp/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE WORKSHOP

Visual modelling techniques provide an intuitive, yet precise way in
order to express and reason about concepts at their natural level of
abstraction.  The success of visual techniques in computer science and
engineering resulted in a variety of methods and notations addressing
different application domains and different phases of the development
process.  Diagrammatic languages are used, for example, during
requirement specification in order to support the communication
between developers and customers; but also for describing the
architecture of systems and as high-level visual programming
languages.

However, despite the wide-spread usage of visual modelling techniques
there is a lack of well-understood (and integrated) methodologies for
defining their syntax and semantics.  Until now, there exists no
equivalent to Backus-Naur-Form which would be the notation for
defining the syntax of a visual language. The same applies to type
systems, deductive proof methods, operational or denotational
semantics for visual modelling techniques. In fact, the situation
could be compared with the state-of-the-art in programming languages
about thirty years ago when the definition and implementation of
languages was an ad-hoc task, and formal semantics was an exception
rather than the rule.

The workshop aims at bringing together scientists and researchers
interested in discussing formal methodologies for the definition of
syntax and semantics of visual modelling techniques.  All aspects of
this problem are of potential interest ranging from the concrete
syntax defined, for example, by Constraint Grammars or Picture Layout
Grammars, the abstract syntax specified by means of Meta Modelling or
Graph Grammars, and the semantics of visual modelling techniques
given, e.g., in terms of Graph Transformation, Process Algebra,
Abstract State Machines, Type Theory, Logic, etc.  In particular, we
believe that Graph Grammars and Graph Transformation may play a
central role in the definition of visual modelling techniques because
they provide the graphical analogous to Chomsky Grammars and Term
Rewriting which are widely used for defining the syntax and semantics
of textual languages.

CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of up to 5 (five) A4
pages.  The contributions should report about ongoing research in the
area of graph transformation and visual modelling techniques,
especially on the syntax and semantics of visual languages according
to the scope and objectives of the workshop. Contributions exploring
the use of Graph Grammars and Graph Transformation Systems are
particularly welcome, as well as papers which cover several aspects or
integrate different formalisms for the definition of visual modelling
techniques. Position papers and contributions making methodological
statements are strongly encouraged. Submissions should be sent
preferably in postscript format to the address <andrea@di.unipi.it>
(Andrea Corradini) before the submission deadline. In the case
electronic submission is not possible, three copies should be sent 
to the address:

       Andrea Corradini
