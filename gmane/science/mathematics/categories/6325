Dear George=2C



Thank you for reminding us of your old notion of Galois structure and cover=
ing morphism in general categories. Although tangentially relevant to the d=
iscussion initiated by Eduardo Dubuc=2C it relates to examples of propertie=
s of continuous maps of spaces (or or morphisms of =A0toposes) studied in m=
y book with Jonathon Funk=2C which may be relevant. I sent you this private=
ly already=2C but on second thoughts I think it might be useful to make it =
public. I begin by quoting a paragraph from your posting.=A0

The notions of discrete fibration and discrete opfibration are lifted from =
categories to geometric morphisms of toposes (in M. Bunge and J. Funk=2C Si=
ngular Coverings of Toposes=2C LNM 1890=2C Springer=2C 2006=2C Chapter 9) r=
elative to the symmetric KZ-monad called M therein for "measures" (M.Bunge =
and A.Carboni=2C JPAA 105 (1995) 233-249). =A0They are=2C respectively=2C t=
he local homeomorphisms and the complete spreads (singular coverings).=A0A =
local homeomorphism over a locally connected space E with defining object X=
  is said to be an unramified covering if it is also a complete spread. Unra=
mified coverings generalize covering morphisms =A0over a locally connected =
space-- if X is a locally constant object of a locally connected space E=2C=
  then the corresponding local homeomorphism is a complete spread=2C hence a=
n unramified covering. The class of unramified coverings is strictly larger=
  than the class of locally constant coverings=2C even over a locally connec=
ted space (J. Funk and E.D. Tymchatyn=2C Unramified maps=2C J. Geometric To=
pology 1(3) (2001) 249-280). Under hypotheses of the locally simply connect=
ed kind=2C=A0unramified coverings are locally constant. The larger class of=
  unramified coverings =A0has some nice properties which the class of locall=
y constant coverings fails to have -- for instance=2C they compose. Moreove=
r=2C a van Kampen theorem holds not just for the class of locally constant =
coverings but also for the larger class of unramified coveirngs (M.Bunge an=
d S. Lack=2C Van Kampen theorems for toposes=2C Advances in Mathematics 179=
/2 (2003) 291-317).=A0It is clear from your theory that both classes of mor=
phisms are instances of what you call a Galois structure on the category of=
  (locally connected) topological spaces.=A0
