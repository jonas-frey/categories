	Preliminary Call For Papers
	Ninth  International Conference on
	Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA '09)

=09
                 Brasilia, July 01-03, 2009


Part of Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and
Programming (RDP'09)


http://rdp09.cic.unb.br/


** Title and abstract due  19 December 2009 **
** Deadline for submission  6 January 2009 **

The TLCA series of conferences serves as a forum for presenting
original research results that are broadly relevant to the theory
and applications of typed calculi. The following list of topics
is non-exhaustive:


     * Proof-theory: Natural deduction and sequent calculi, cut
       elimination and normalisation, linear logic and proof nets,
       type-theoretic aspects of computational complexity
     * Semantics: Denotational semantics, game semantics,
       realisability, categorical models
     * Implementation: Abstract machines, parallel execution, optimal
       reduction, type systems for program optimisation
     * Types: Subtypes, dependent types, type inference, polymorphism,
       types in theorem proving
     * Programming: Foundational aspects of functional and
       object-oriented programming, proof search and logic programming,
       connections between and combinations of functional and logic
       programming, type checking


The programme of TLCA'09 will consist of three invited talks (one common
with the Conference Rewriting Techniques and
Applications) and about 25 papers selected from original contributions.
Accepted papers will  be published as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html).


Invited Speakers

The submitted papers should describe original work and should allow
the Programme Committee to assess the merits of the contribution. In
particular references and comparisons with related work should be
included. Submission of material already published or submitted to
other conferences with published proceedings is not allowed. Papers
should not exceed 15 pages in Springer LNCS format
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html).
