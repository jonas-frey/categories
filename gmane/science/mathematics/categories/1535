*                 CALL FOR PAPERS
********************************************************

The TLCA series of conferences aims at providing a forum for the
presentation and discussion of current research in a field which was
originally rather restricted, but has now expanded considerably.
Typical areas include, but are not limited to:

Proof theory: 
Natural Deduction and Sequent Calculi, Cut elimination and
Normalization, Computational interpretations of Classical Logic, 
Linear Logic and Proof Nets, Bounded systems capturing complexity
classes

Semantics: 
Denotational semantics, Operational semantics, Game  semantics,
Realizability, Categorical models, Logical Relations, Full Completeness

Implementation:
Abstract machines, Parallel execution, Optimal Reduction

Types:
Polymorphism, Dependent types, Intersection types, Subtypes

Logical Foundations:
Logical Frameworks, Pure Type Systems, Proof checking

Programming:
Foundational aspects of: Functional programming, Proof search and logic
programming, Connections between and combinations of functional and
logic programming, Type checking, Higher-order rewriting, Higher-order
unification and matching
