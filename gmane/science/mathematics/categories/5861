I should let Michael speak for himself, but I have the impression that he
intends to found all his work on FOLDS - "first-order logic with dependent
sorts".  In this paper:

http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/folds/foldsinpdf/FOLDS.pdf

he writes:

"The restriction on the use of equality in FOLDS is a fundamental feature.
FOLDS is to be used in formulating categorical situations in which, for
example, equality of objects of a category is not an admissible primitive.
The absence of term-forming operators, to be interpreted as
functions, is a consequence of the absence of equality; it seems to me that
the notion of "function" is incoherent without equality.

It is convenient to regard FOLDS a logic without equality entirely, and deal
with equality, as much as is needed of it, as extralogical primitives."

Best,
