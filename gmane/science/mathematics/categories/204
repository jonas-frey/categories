Not to denigrate your interesting variation,
but you get a result more like traditional set theory
if you say that each container contains a *single* note
which itself has a list of containers written on it:
   - Container ::= {c| Note |c}
   - Note ::= {n| Container* |n}
(You could also have a list of notes, each of which has one container.)

Of course, this is functionally equivalent to
   - Container ::= {c| Container* |c}
This is the usual model of what pure sets are like,
but (as you and your daughter noted) this give an unphysical metaphor.
However, you could just as easily do things like this:
   - Note ::= {n| Note* |n}
Since {n|...|n} contains things by writing down names for them,
rather than having them physically present as {c|...|c} implies,
there is no physical impossibility here.

Incidentally, the notation X* suggests to me a list,
where order and repetition matter and only finitely many terms can appear.
Of course, sets are not like this, as you know.
So instead of X* I would write P(X), using "P" for "power".

This matches how category theorists model pure sets
(the sets that appear in ZF-style set theory).
A _universe of pure sets_ consists of a set U
and a function from U to the power set P(U) of U,
or if you prefer a binary relation E (for 'epsilon') on U,
satisfying a few axioms (extensionality and well-foundedness,
although it's also interesting to consider ill-founded sets).
You get paradoxes like Russell's if you add the axiom
that the function U -> P(U) is invertible.

Of course, I said "set" above, but there I just meant
an object of the category of sets as category theorists think of it.
That is, simply a collection of atoms that may be equal
but have no other structure (and in particular are not themselves sets).
So this shows how to model ZF-style set theory in categorial set theory.
(I apologise for repetition if you already know all about that.)
