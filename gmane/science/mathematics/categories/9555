                            Call for Short Contributions

                         The 14th International Workshop on
                  Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science (CMCS'18)
                      Thessaloniki, Greece, 14 - 15 April 2018
                            (co-located with ETAPS 2018)
                                www.coalg.org/cmcs18

Objectives and scope
--------------------
Established in 1998, the CMCS workshops aim to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras, their
logics, and their applications. As the workshop series strives to
maintain breadth in its scope, areas of interest include neighbouring
fields as well.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
   approaches);
- coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
   languages, dynamical systems, term rewriting, etc.);
- coalgebras in (functional, logic, answer set, object-oriented,
   concurrent, and constraint) programming;
- coalgebraic data types, type systems and behavioural typing;
- coinductive definition and proof principles for coalgebras (including
   "up-to" techniques);
- coalgebras and algebras;
- coalgebras and (modal) logic;
- coalgebraic specification and verification;
- coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid
   systems);
- coalgebra in quantum computing;
- coalgebra and game theory;
- tools exploiting coalgebraic techniques.
