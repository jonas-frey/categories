Dear Toby,

The theory of monoidal categories and bicategories is already written.
I may be interested in working with them, even though it is unpleasant =
to recur to choice for most (non-strict) structures of these kinds.
I have no interest in rewriting these theories in a different shape, =
using anafunctors or similar tools, or even study such variations if =
someone has given them.
Of course other people may prefer the way you are saying.
I just wanted to point out that there are many occasions where we are =
led to use choice - at least if we want to stay within 'classical' =
category theory, as expounded - say - in Mac Lane's text.
Regards,    Marco
