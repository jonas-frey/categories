Dear categorists,

I have three questions, the first one is a mathematical question, the
second one a bibliographical question and the last one is a speculative
question.

1) Let K be a complete, cocomplete and cartesian closed category.
Consider the category DK of all small diagrams over K. The objects are
all small diagrams F:I-->K from a small category I to K. And a map from
(F:I-->K) to (G:J-->K) is a functor f:I-->J together with a natural
transformation mu:F-->Gf. DK is complete and cocomplete and I would like
to know if it is cartesian closed as well.

2) My question was initially posted in
https://mathoverflow.net/q/266597/24563. From MathOverflow, I now know
that the functor DK-->Cat forgetting K is a fibred category. Since then,
I browsed the Borceux book's chapter devoted to fibred categories (Vol.2
Chap.8). Is there other reference you could recommend me ?

3) I also would like to know what is known about the link between
locally presentability and fibred category. Googling these terms or
looking them up in MathSciNet together gives nothing relevant. Actually,
my motivation is to know whether D(DeltaTop) and D(SimplicialSet) are
locally presentable and cartesian closed (DeltaTop is the category of
Delta-generated spaces, and SimplicialSet the category of simplicial
sets). Therefore I would like to conclude this email with a speculative
question: is there a general philosophy to deduce from the properties of
the fibers of a fibred category E-->B the same property on E ? In the
case of DK-->Cat, the fiber over I is the well-known category of
I-shaped diagrams over K...
