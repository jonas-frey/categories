                                MPC 2004

                     7th International Conference on

                   MATHEMATICS OF PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION
                   -----------------------------------

                  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/MPC2004

                  Organised in conjunction with AMAST '04

                            12--14 July, 2004

                          Stirling, Scotland, UK


                             CALL FOR PAPERS


This conference aims to promote the development of mathematical
principles and techniques that are demonstrably useful in the
process of constructing computer programs, whether implemented
in hardware or software.

The focus of the conference is on techniques that combine
precision with conciseness, enabling programs to be constructed by
formal calculation.  Within this theme, the scope of the conference
is very diverse.  We welcome contributions to programming
methodology (for example, formal methods for program specification
and transformation), to programming paradigms (for example,
generic programming techniques and type systems) and to language
design (for example, programming calculi and programming language
semantics).  Theoretical contributions are welcome provided their
relevance to program construction is evident; discussion of
applications is welcome provided the mathematical basis is evident.

The conference will be organized in conjunction with the AMAST '04
Conference. There will also be a number of co-located workshops,
including CMPP.  Proceedings will be published in a volume of
Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
