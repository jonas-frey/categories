The philosopher Gottfried Leibniz believed that every entity in the
Universe is a separate substance that doesn't interact with others. He
called these substances "monads". All properties and events that happen
to a monad are implicit in its nature from its creation. So if an apple
falls from a tree and bounces off my head, there is actually no contact:
the apple-monad bounces by itself without the help of my head and the
Venanzio-monad feels pain without the intervention of the apple. All
monads are synchronized from creation by the wisdom of God.
  This implies that every monad has an internal representation of every
entity in the universe and these representations can never influence
objects outside the monad.
  The analogy with our monads should be evident!
