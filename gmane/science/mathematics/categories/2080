(before completion of the PhD degree). Papers co-authored by
non-students will not be accepted.  Papers may be accepted for full
presentation (30 minutes including 10 minutes of discussion) or for
a poster presentation.  All the accepted papers will be published in
the ESSLLI-2003 Student Session proceedings, which will be made
available during the summer school.
