The 2018 Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and
Computation

Call for Nominations

Introduction

An annual award, called the Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding
Contributions to Logic and Computation, was established in 2015 by the
ACM Special Interest Group for Logic and Computation (SIGLOG), the
European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), the
European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL), and the Kurt
G??del Society (KGS). The award is for an outstanding contribution
represented by a paper or by a small group of papers published within
the past 25 years. This time span allows the lasting impact and depth of
the contribution to have been established. The award can be given to an
individual, or to a group of individuals who have collaborated on the
research. For the rules governing this award,
see: http://siglog.org/awards/alonzo-church-award/.

The 2017 Alonzo Church Award was given jointly to Samson Abramsky, Radha
Jagadeesan, Pasquale Malacaria, Martin Hyland, Luke Ong, and Hanno
Nickau for providing a fully-abstract semantics for higher-order
computation through the introduction of game models,
see: http://siglog.org/winners-of-the-2017-alonzo-church-award/.

Eligibility and Nominations

The contribution must have appeared in a paper or papers published
within the past 25 years. Thus, for the 2018 award, the cut-off date is
January 1, 1993. When a paper has appeared in a conference and then in a
journal, the date of the journal publication will determine the cut-off
date. In addition, the contribution must not yet have received
recognition via a major award, such as the Turing Award, the Kanellakis
Award, or the G??del Prize. (The nominee(s) may have received such awards
for other contributions.) While the contribution can consist of
conference or journal papers, journal papers will be given a preference.

Nominations for the 2018 award are now being solicited. The nominating
letter must summarise the contribution and make the case that it is
fundamental and outstanding. The nominating letter can have multiple
co-signers. Self-nominations are excluded. Nominations must include: a
proposed citation (up to 25 words); a succinct (100-250 words)
description of the contribution; and a detailed statement (not exceeding
four pages) to justify the nomination. Nominations may also be
accompanied by supporting letters and other evidence of worthiness.

Nominations should be submitted to catuscia@lix.polytechnique.fr by
*March 1, 2018*.

Presentation of the Award

The 2018 award will be presented at ICALP 2018, the International
Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming. The award will be
accompanied by an invited lecture by the award winner, or by one of the
award winners. The awardee(s) will receive a certificate and a cash
prize of USD 2,000. If there are multiple awardees, this amount will be
shared.

Award Committee

The 2018 Alonzo Church Award Committee consists of the following five
members: Thomas Eiter, Javier Esparza, Catuscia Palamidessi (chair),
Gordon Plotkin, and Natarajan Shankar.
