Third International Workshop on Bidirectional Transformations (BX 2014)
*Deadline extended due to many requests. Original deadline became =
abstract deadline.*
Friday March 28th, 2014
Athens, Greece
co-located with EDBT/ICDT 2014

Web site:
http://bx-community.wikidot.com/bx2014:home

Submission site:
https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=3Dbx2014

Paper length: 3-8 pages, ACM format. In-progress work is highly =
encouraged, if limited to 4 pages.

Bidirectional transformations (bx) are a mechanism for maintaining the =
consistency of at least two related sources of information. Such sources =
can be relational data, software models, documents, graphs, trees, and =
so on. BX are an emerging topic in a wide range of research areas with =
prominent presence at top conferences in different fields. However, much =
of the research in bx tends to get limited exposure outside of a single =
field of study.

The purpose of this workshop series is not only to further research into =
bx, but to promote cross-disciplinary research and awareness in the =
area. The first two instances of this workshop, BX'12 and BX'13, served =
as a dedicated venue for bx in all relevant areas, including:
- Databases
- Programming Languages
- Software Engineering
- Graph Transformation

This instance of the workshop is the first at a database venue. The =
workshop rotates between venues in different areas to promote the =
cross-disciplinary nature of the work, as methodologies used for bx =
range from classical program transformation and updateable views to =
graph transformation techniques, from ad-hoc techniques for data =
synchronization to the development of domain-specific languages and =
their integration. We also solicit papers on model/metamodel =
co-evolution, which is a different yet closely related subject.

Aims and Topics
The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and =
practitioners, established and new, interested in bidirectional =
transformations from different perspectives, such as:
* inversion of data exchange mappings
* new perspectives on view updatability
* data-schema co-evolution and data synchronization
* software-model synchronization
* consistency analysis
* (coupled) software/model transformations
* language-based approaches

Submissions can be:
* novel research concepts and results
* position papers and research perspectives
* application of bx in new domains
* analysis of gaps between formal concepts and application scenarios
* examination of the efficiency of algorithms
* analysis/classification of requirements for bx technologies
* proposals and justification for benchmarks
* summary papers providing novel comparisons between existing =
technologies
* case studies and tool support

Submitted papers must be in ACM format in accordance with the other =
workshops and proceedings at EDBT/ICDT. Papers may be 3-8 pages in =
length; the length of the paper should be appropriate for the level of =
completeness of the work.

Important Dates:
Abstract submission date: 7th December 2013
Paper submission date: 13th December 2013
Author notification: 7th January 2014
Camera-ready date: 20th January 2014
Workshop date: 28th March 2014
Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings of =
EDBT/ICDT and will be available at the conference.=
