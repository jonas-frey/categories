A couple of remarks about this.  First the trivial one: "bi-ccc" is a
misleading term (I've used it myself, with the same confusion induced
in others), when all you mean is a ccc with coproducts.

More importantly, when you look at the structure of proofs in
intuitionist logic, you find that sum and product are not really dual
- though I have to admit this is very much a matter of presentation.
The problem is an old one: Zucker (in the early 70's I think) pointed
out that normalization steps are not the same as cut elimination
steps, particularly for disjunction.  I looked at this in my 1977
thesis, using natural deduction (in the Gentzen-Prawitz formulation)
for the logic (this has the advantage over the sequent calculus of
giving a category without need for any equivalence relation on
derivations).  Taking eta and beta (one an expansion, the other a
reduction) as 2-cells, I looked at the 2-categorical structure of the
connectives (and quantifiers, though really forall and exists are very
similar respectively to conjunction and disjunction, not
surprisingly).  It's easy to see that conjunction is a weak adjoint
without any further structure, but disjunction is NOT - unless you add
some permuting conversions (equivalences): in fact exactly the
permuting rewrites Prawitz had already identified earlier.  And
function types are a mess in this setting, unless you make the
conjunction a real product (again by introducing equivalences - this
time just beta and eta).  You can find a sketch of all this in two
extended abstracts I published: one in the Durham 1977 Category
Meeting ("Applications of sheaves ...", SLNM 753), and the other in
LICS 1987.  (Both are available on my webpage.)

(BTW - this was all done long before Ghani looked at the matter
... Barry Jay also subsequently looked at this.  But the higher
dimensional structure of intuitionist logic is still largely
un-studied, and merits serious attention.)
