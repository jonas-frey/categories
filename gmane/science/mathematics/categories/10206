CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------

22nd International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM 2020),
2-6 November 2020, Singapore (subject to changes, including backup options
such as postponing the conference or hosting it online).

http://formal-analysis.com/icfem/2020/

Extended deadlines:
Full Paper Submissions Due: 17 May 2020 (AoE)
Workshop/Tutorial Proposals Due: 20 March 2020
Acceptance/Rejection Notification: 5 July 2020
Camera-ready Due: 17 July 2020

Since 1997, ICFEM provides a forum for both researchers and practitioners
who are interested in developing practical formal methods for software
engineering or applying existing formal techniques to improve software
development process in practice systems. Formal Methods for the development
of computer systems have been extensively researched and studied. We now
have good theoretical understandings of how to describe what programs do,
how they do it, and why they work. A range of semantic theories,
specification languages, design techniques, verification methods, and
supporting tools have been developed and applied to the construction of
programs of moderate size that are used in critical applications. The
remaining challenge now is how to deal with problems in developing and
maintaining large scale and complex computer systems.

The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, and
government experts, from a variety of user domains and software
disciplines, to help advance state of the art. Researchers, practitioners,
tool developers and users, and technology transfer experts are all welcome.
We are interested in work that has been incorporated into real production
systems, and in theoretical work that promises to bring practical, tangible
engineering benefits.

Scope and Topics:
Submissions related to the following principal themes are encouraged, but
any topics relevant to the field of formal engineering methods and their
practical applications will also be considered:

=E2=80=A2 Abstraction, refinement and evolution
=E2=80=A2 Formal specification and modelling
=E2=80=A2 Formal verification and analysis
=E2=80=A2 Model checking
=E2=80=A2 Formal approaches to software testing and inspection
=E2=80=A2 Formal methods for self-adaptive systems
=E2=80=A2 Formal methods for object-oriented systems
=E2=80=A2 Formal methods for component-based systems
=E2=80=A2 Formal methods for concurrent and real-time systems
=E2=80=A2 Formal methods for cloud computing
=E2=80=A2 Formal methods for cyber-physical systems
=E2=80=A2 Formal methods for software safety and security
=E2=80=A2 Formal methods for software reliability and dependability
=E2=80=A2 Development, integration and experiments involving verified syste=
ms
=E2=80=A2 Formal certification of products under international standards
=E2=80=A2 Formal model-based development and code generation

Submission and Publication:
Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be
concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be
judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, technical
and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference. The proceedings
will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

Papers should be written in English and should not exceed 16 pages in LNCS
format. Submissions should be made through the ICFEM 2020 submission page,
handled by the EasyChair conference management system.

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dicfem20

Workshop or tutorial proposals should be directly sent to the Workshop
Chair via email. Each proposal should include (1) title, scope, and aims,
(2) brief bio of the organizer or lecturer, and (3) postal and email
addresses.
