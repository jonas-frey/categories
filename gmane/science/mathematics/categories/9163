Hi -

The University of California at Riverside is
trying to hire some visiting assistant professors.
We plan to make decisions quite soon.

The positions are open to applicants with a
minimum of Ph.D or will have a Ph.D by the
beginning of the term from all research areas
in Mathematics. The teaching load is six courses
per year (i.e. 2 per quarter). In addition to
teaching, the applicants will be responsible for
attending advanced seminars and working on
research projects.

This is initially a one-year appointment, and with
successful annual teaching review, it is renewable
for up to a third year term.

For more details, including how to apply, go here:

Best,
John Baez
