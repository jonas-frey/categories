 		    Call for Abstract Submissions

 		     ICGT 2008 Doctoral Symposium
 	      http://www.di.unipi.it/~andrea/ICGT08-DS/

 		      An event to be held during

 			      ICGT 2008
 	 4th International Conference on Graph Transformation
 	  Leicester (United Kingdom), September 9 - 12, 2008
 	       <http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/icgt2008>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The  ICGT  2008 Doctoral  Symposium  will  consist  of some  technical
sessions  held   during  the   ICGT  2008  Conference,   dedicated  to
presentations by  PhD students and by young  researchers who completed
their doctoral studies within the past two years.

ICGT  2008  aims  to  bring  together  researchers  and  practitioners
interested in the foundations and applications of graph transformation
to a variety of areas. A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest can
be found on the conference web pages:

 	 <http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/icgt2008/Scope.html>

Within  ICGT  2008,  the  Doctoral  Symposium will  provide  a  unique
opportunity  for  doctoral  students  and  young  researchers  (having
defended their thesis  at most two years previously)  to interact with
established researchers of the graph transformation community and with
other students.

The Doctoral Symposium will be held on a date to be determined, during
the regular activities of the ICGT 2008 conference.

Presentations  for   the  Doctoral  Symposium  will   be  selected  by
designated   members  of   the  ICGT   2008  Program   Committee  (see
<http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/icgt2008/Scope.html>    according    to
originality,  significance,  and general  interest,  on  the basis  of
submitted three-pages abstracts. Accepted abstracts, revised according
to  the  comments by  the  reviewers, will  be  included  in the  LNCS
proceedings of the Conference.

After  the  conference,  selected  authors of  presentations  will  be
invited to  submit a full paper of  at most 15 pages  for the refereed
post-proceedings of  the Doctoral Symposium,  which is expected  to be
published as  a volume of  the Electronic Communications of  the EASST
(European Association of Software Science and Technology).
