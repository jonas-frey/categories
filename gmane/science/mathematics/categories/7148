I want to second this.  When I earlier wrote that I was using "category with
direct sums" I did not mention that the alternative I use is "category with
biproducts".  The reason I mostly use direct sum rather than biproduct is that
it is familiar to students where biproduct is not, but "category with
biproducts" does seem a better choice for articles in category theory.

I liked Bill Lawvere's suggestion of linear category but it has at least two
alternative meanings in the literature and for my students the connection with
linear logic just causes too much confusion.
