Part of the point of a mass organized boycott is to collapse the "impact =
factor" of Elsevier journals.

Of course, the boycott might be even more effective if scientists were =
to refuse to play along with
the "impact factor" charade and en masse declare that they will ignore =
the corrupt statistic when
judging grant proposals and job candidates.

I see some biologists have signed on.  Getting the boycott to spread =
beyond the mathematical
sciences and to include a few Nobel laureates as well as Fields =
Medalists would make it a whole
lot more effective. =20

(Of course, I though ArXiV already was a "Math-Megaupload".)

Best Thoughts,
D. Yetter
