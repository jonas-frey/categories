I wonder whether it makes sense to introduce notions, which only in the
duals of familiar categories. Of course, Set^op is equivalent to the
category of complete atomic Boolean algebras, but I do not see that the =
dual
of exponentiation plays an important role in the theory if these Boolean
algebras.

In classical logic, one can form this "co-implication" but it does not =
look
very interesting to me. In intuitionistic logic I do not see how to add =
it
more ore less meaningfully (e.g. in such a way that it is left adjoint =
to
"or" in the first argument).
