I should have attributed the quotations.

Correct.

According to the course descriptions here at UBC, there is at least
a mention of series in first year courses.  Fourier and other series
appear in 2nd & 3rd years.

Engineer speaking.  Mathematicians, don't be too critical.

What I recall from a brief study decades ago is that each of the
familiar series--Taylor, Laurent, Fourier & etc.--is based upon a
set of orthogonal functions.  So I wondered whether the category of
sets of orthogonal functions has been thoroughly studied.  Such a
study might show the necessity of infinite series to represent the
inverses of some functions.  Wishful thinking?

Thanks,                  ... Peter E.
