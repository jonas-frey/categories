Thanks to all who wrote something on this question.

It clarified mi ignorance:

There is the category of finite sets, namely, the category of all those=20
sets which happen to be finite. No need of more precision. But it is not=20
small (or an element of the universe if you like).

If you want small, then there are plenty of them, and anybody can use=20
their FAVORITE one. But this is not usually done, it seems that the fact=20
that the canonical one is =93essentially small=94 is good enough to dismi=
ss=20
all possible problems.

For example, people which consider the presheaf category=20
Set^((Set_f)^op)  (object classifier) often do as if Set_f  were=20
canonical and small.

Now, if you work with a  Grothendieck base topos =93as if it were the=20
category of sets=94, you are forced to specify which small category of=20
finite sets you are using,    or not ?.

Cheers  e.d.
