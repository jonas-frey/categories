Many thanks to everybody who answered my questions!

I understand the picture with unitality being a property and not a =
structure now.

As for the universal characterization I have in mind something like =
this:

1. For a functor F on a category with finite coproducts such that for =
each X0 there exists the initial
algebra I(F\coprod X0) of the functor X |-> F(X)\coprd X0, these initial =
algebras are functorial=20
and in fact X |-> I(F\coprod X) has an obvious monad structure and this =
monad is the free monad
generated by F.=20

This construction is what connects free monads with free algebras.

2. What can one do for a non-unital monad? It seems to me at the moment =
that the functor

X |-> I(F\coprod F(X))=20

may be the free non-unital monad generated by F.=20

Vladimir.
