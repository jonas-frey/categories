Geoffrey Lloyd's book "Adversaries and Authorities: Investigations into
Ancient Greek and Chinese Science" has a discussion of how the Greek legal
system influenced Greek concepts of rationality.  While I haven't read it i=
n
a long while, I think it makes a good case that the concepts of "proof" in
Western law, medicine, science, and mathematics are deeply intertwined.
It's very useful to compare Greece with China on these issues.  You could
get a taste of it here:

t=3Dresult&resnum=3D1&ved=3D0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=3Donepage&q=3Dproof&f=3Dfalse

but the whole book is fascinating.  It would also make a good citation - an=
d
it contains many further references.
