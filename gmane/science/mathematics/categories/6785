Dear Andre=2C

Sounds good=2C except that I do not quite see what the status of such an ax=
iom is if added to ET + NNO. I do not doubt that any GT satisfies it.=A0


An alternative=2C which I had in mind and on which spoke about it in my 1 h=
our lecture at Calais 2008=2C is to add (ASC)^n for each n>0 to ET + NNO. H=
ow to state (ASC)^n in elementary terms relies on Lemma 8.2 of Bunge-Hermid=
a=2C of which I have sketched a proof by induction. It says that for every =
epimorphism e from J to I in E=2C the induced n-functor (F_e)^n from the n-=
kernel of e to the discrete n-category on I is a weak n-equivalence n-funct=
or (as defined in Def. 8.1). Intended definition: An n-category C in E is a=
n n-stack if for every epimorphism e=2C C inverts (F_e) in the sense of n-e=
quivalence. This is an elementary axiom for each n >0=2C =A0and one could a=
dd as many as one needed for a specific purpose. In constructing the 2-stac=
k completion=2C I only needed the n=3D1 case. So=2C for 3-stack completions=
=2C n =3D 1 and n=3D2 would suffice. Etc. Beyond that I cannot envisage any=
  uses of n-stacks. But then=2C I am not a higher-order category person.

In any case=2C this is getting interesting.=A0

Best regards=2C
Marta
