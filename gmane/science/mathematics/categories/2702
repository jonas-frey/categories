This situation has been encountered since at least 1970 by various
categorists, including myself.  A relevant paper is:
  D. Pumpl\"un, Eine Bemerkung \"uber Monaden und adjungierte Funktoren,
  Math. Annalen 185, 329-337 (1970).
If Gaunce's two commuting diagrams are the usual ones, then his
conjecture is correct.  Observe that in this situation, we have not just
a pair but a quadruple of dual categories, replacing C and D by their
duals, or inverting the direction of arrows, or both.

This may just be a "folk theorem", but it should have been published by
someone, somewhere, and I would also like to have an easily accessible
reference, or references.
