Dear Colleagues,

A 1-year postdoctoral fellowship is available on the UK EPSRC-funded
grant ``Foundational Structures in Computer Science'', to work on topics
related to game semantics. Further details of this position can be found
at 
 www.personnel.ed.ac.uk/vacs/external 
(Click vac3ext.htm, and then ``8 Postdoctoral Research fellowships''.
The relevant posts are the first two of these.).

I would be very grateful if you could bring this position to the
attention of anyone in your group who might be interested.

Anyone wishing to discuss the project informally is welcome to contact
me by email.

Best wishes,

Samson Abramsky
