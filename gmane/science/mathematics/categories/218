Whereas my recollection (from those dear dim days beyond recall when I
was present on a weekly basis for ND about that time)
was that the terminology went from Mac Lane to May with
operad to match monad

as I recall, Mac Lane liked monad because of the philosophical connection
Leibniz as philosopher not as mathematician?

    * Monad (Greek philosophy) a term used by ancient philosophers
Pythagoras, Parmenides, Xenophanes, Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus as a
term for God or the first being, or the totality of all being.
    * Monism, the concept of "one essence" in the metaphysical and
theological theory
    * Monad (Gnosticism), the most primal aspect of God in Gnosticism
    ****** Monadology, a book of philosophy by Gottfried Leibniz in
which monads are a basic unit of perceptual reality
    * Monadologia Physica by Immanuel Kant
    * The Cup or Monad, a text in the Corpus Hermetica
from the Wiki
