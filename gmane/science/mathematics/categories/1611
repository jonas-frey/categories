Max might want to look into the possiblity of taking back the
copyright if CUP no longer is interested - I know that Jim Lambek and
Mike Barr both had their books published by other publishers when
original ones no longer wanted to keep them in print.  (Jim used
Chelsea, which is no longer an option, but Mike used the CRM at U
Montreal, which certainly is - and there are no doubt other
possibilities, including some closer to (Max's) home.)  Of course, we
could just scan it and put it on the web, but that'd be illegal :-)
