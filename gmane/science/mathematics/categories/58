That's actually a quote from Toby Bartels, not from me.
It's a statement about a topos built over the classical topos of sets;
the argument is a rather ad hoc one, and I'm not sure to what extent
it's possible to make it constructive. However, as I said elsewhere, I
prefer to work with the gros topos of spaces (i.e. sheaves on a suitable
full subcategory of spaces for the coverage consisting of jointly-
surjective families of open inclusions) and there it's quite clear
what you need: namely, Heine--Borel (equivalently, exponentiability
of R in your category of spaces). That's not true in all toposes;
you could try to get round it by basing your gros topos on locales
rather than spaces (the locale of formal reals being constructively
locally compact), but it's not clear (to me, at least) what the
result would actually mean if you based yourself on a topos where
the formal reals aren't spatial.

I don't think there is any doubt that the map exists. The problem is that,
for most if not all schools of constructivism, it's wildly non-surjective.
