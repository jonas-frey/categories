Greetings,

I think you've rediscovered, in

>      Nat(P, P) =3D Nat(Ring(Z[X], -), P) =3D Z[X],

the unary fragment of what Lawvere called the algebraic structure =

of that functor Rings --> Sets.

The n-ary fragment resides in the analogous calculation

Nat (P^n, P) =3D Nat(Ring(Z[X], -)^n, P) =

  =3D Nat(Ring(Z[X_1, ..., X_n], -), P) =3D Z[X_1, ..., X_n].

Cheers, -- Fred
