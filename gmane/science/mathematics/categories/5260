Vaughan's argument appears in the Elephant (but with the second square,
which he has indicated by dots, drawn in, so that there are seven arrows)
as Lemma A1.1.4. Though it's not credited there, I learned it from
Peter Freyd --- I can't remember when, but that part of the Elephant
was written well before 1998.
