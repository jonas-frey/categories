Both constructions have plenty of examples; the OED online=E2=80=99s wild-c=
ard
search is useful here, e.g.
http://www.oed.com/search?searchType=3Ddictionary&q=3D*orical&_searchBtn=3D=
Search.
This gives 81 words with -orical, against 279 with -orial.  The -orial
examples are mostly from verb roots =E2=80=94 dictatorial, professorial, et=
c.
=E2=80=94 but with some exceptions: armorial, (im)memorial, and so on.  I=
=E2=80=99m
not enough of a linguist to see any full explanation for which words
get which suffix.

But in the case of categories, the OED backs up what others have
written: categorists are/were simply following standard usage.
=E2=80=9CCategorical=E2=80=9D is older and more widely used, going back to =
1598, and
with plenty of both colloquial and technical usage.  =E2=80=9CCategorial=E2=
=80=9D
appears in 1912 in philosophy, and from the 50=E2=80=99s in linguistics, bu=
t
remains mostly restricted to these fields.  Google N-grams gives a
quick view of the comparative frequency:

http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=3Dcategorical%2Ccategorial&yea=
r_start=3D1800&year_end=3D2000&corpus=3D0&smoothing=3D3

Even proponents of =E2=80=9Ccategorial=E2=80=9D generally take this for gra=
nted, I
think.  Goldblatt, in the preface of his (lovely) book on topoi,
explains his motivation as precisely to *break* with the older and
more common usage of =E2=80=9Ccategorical=E2=80=9D in logic, to distinguish=
  the new
sense from the old.

Best,
=E2=80=93Peter.
