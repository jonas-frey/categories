Hi Paul,=20

I think that I have written previously to the list about the=20
possibility of a monoidal functor acting on a mere functor,=20
and what you have is an instance of this notion. =20

Here the monoidal functor is the unique functor M ---> T,
where T is the terminal (monoidal) category.  Your beta is=20
a right action of this guy on F.

In general, a right action of monoidal A --U--> C on mere=20
P --F--> S requires a right action of A on P and a right=20
action of C on S as well as a natural transformation=20
  F(p)*U(a) --beta(p,a)--> F(p*a)=20
satisfying the appropriate associativity and unit axioms.

In your case S is equipped with the trivial right T-action=20
(x*1=3Dx), and M with its canonical right M-action (a*b=3Da*b). =20
The axioms are identical.

Cheers,
Jeff.
