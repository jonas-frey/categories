Dear colleagues,

The Foundation Sciences Mathematiques de Paris

www.sciencesmaths-paris.fr

that covers all fields of mathematics as well as (theoretical)
computer science, launches its 2008 programs, including
an attractive research chair and a postdoc programme. Applications
that are particularly suited for one of the two research labs of the
Foundation

(LIAFA and PPS: www.liafa.jussieu.fr and www.pps.jussieu.fr)

and possibly for one of the research teams at INRIA Rocquencourt
(which has an agreement with the foundation)
are welcome. The deadline for application is

**** January 7, 2008 ****

The application procedure is as indicated on the website.  But I can
only highly recommend that potential candidates take prior contacts
with a member of the hosting laboratory. Only candidates with a clear
research fit, and a high research profile may have a chance to win
this tough competition, given its broad scope!
Dion't hesitate to contact me or one of my colleages in Paris 7
University for further details or advice.

Best regards,

Pierre-Louis
