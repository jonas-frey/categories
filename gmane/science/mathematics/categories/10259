        (PC chairs: Jan Friso Groote, Techn. Univ. Eindhoven,
        The Netherlands, and Kim G. Larsen, Aalborg Univ., Denmark)
       =20
TACAS '21 will host the 10th Competition on Software Verification
(SV-COMP).

-- SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS --

The four main conferences of ETAPS 2021 solicit contributions of the
following types. All page limits are given **excluding bibliography**.=20

   * ESOP: regular research papers of max 25 pp
   * FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of
     max 18 pp,
     tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp + mandatory appendix of max 6
     pp,
   * FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp=20
   * TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers and regular tool
     papers of max 16 pp,
     tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp

For definitions of the different paper types and specific
instructions, where they are present, see the webpages of the
individual conferences.

All accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings and have
presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is
that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the
conference to give the presentation.

Submitted papers must be in English presenting original research. They
must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In
particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to
multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.

Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer's LNCS
and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author
interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to
the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.

FASE will use double-blind reviewing. Authors are asked to omit their
names and institutions; refer to own prior work in the third person;
not to include acknowledgements that might identify them.

Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS
must be accompanied by an artifact. The artifact will be evaluated and
the outcome will be taken into account in the acceptance decision of
the paper.=20

ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase. TACAS will have
rebuttal for selected papers.=20


-- PUBLICATION

The proceedings will be published in the Advanced Research in
Computing and Software Science (ARCoSS) subline of Springer's LNCS
series. The proceedings volumes will appear in gold open access, so
the published versions of all papers will be available for everyone to
download from the publisher's website freely, from the date of online
publication, perpetually. The copyright of the papers will remain with
the authors.


-- SATELLITE EVENTS (27-28 March) --

A number of satellite workshops will take place before the main
conferences.


-- CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION --

Luxembourg is the capital of the small European nation of the same
name. Built amid deep gorges cut by the Alzette and P=C3=A9trusse rivers,
it is famed for its ruins of medieval fortifications. The vast Bock
Casemates tunnel network encompasses a dungeon, prison and the
Archaeological Crypt, considered the city's birthplace. Along ramparts
above, the Chemin de la Corniche promenade offers dramatic viewpoints.

ETAPS 2021 is organised by the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security,
Reliability and Trust (SnT), Universit=C3=A9 du Luxembourg.


-- ORGANIZERS --

General chair: Peter Y. A. Ryan (SnT & Universit=C3=A9 du Luxembourg)

Workshops chair: Joaquin Garcia-Alfaro (Telecom SudParis, France)

Organization chair: Peter Roenne (SnT Luxembourg)

Event manager: Magali Martin (SnT Luxembourg)
