Dear All,

My understanding, having studied in some detail the behavioural,
psychological, and cognitive scientific studies, is that a serious study =
of
mathematics (beginning with Lawvere & Schanuel's Conceptual Mathematics)
can inform cognitive sciences more so than the other way around, with all
due respect to Dan Kahneman and those 'where mathematics comes from' guys=
.

Thank you,
posina
