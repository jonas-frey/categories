                          Types Meeting 2013
                      Toulouse, 23-26 April 2013

                     FIRST CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

The 19th Conference "Types for Proofs and Programs" will take place in
Toulouse, France, from 23 to 26 April 2013.

The Types Meeting is a forum to present new and on-going work in all
aspects of type theory and its applications, especially in formalized
and computer assisted reasoning and computer programming.

Invited speakers:

* Steve Awodey, Department of Philosophy, Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.A.

* Lars Birkedal, Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University, Denmark

* Ulrich Kohlenbach, Department of Mathematics, TU Darmstadt, Germany

We invite all researchers to contribute talks on subjects related to
the Types area of interest. These include, but are not limited to:

- Foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics;
- Applications of type theory;
- Dependently typed programming;
- Industrial uses of type theory technology;
- Meta-theoretic studies of type systems;
- Proof assistants and proof technology;
- Automation in computer-assisted reasoning;
- Links between type theory and functional programming;
- Formalizing mathematics using type theory.

We would like to especially encourage talks proposing new ways of
applying type theory.

The talks may be based on newly published papers or work submitted for
publication, but also work in progress. There are no formal
pre-proceedings, but we will make available the abstract book for the
conference.

Meanwhile, post-proceedings are confirmed to appear in LIPIcs (Leibniz
International Proceedings in Informatics), Schloss Dagstuhl, see
http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics
(the same publisher as for the last TYPES meeting in Bergen in 2011)
There will be a separate call for papers, and participation in TYPES
2013 is no prerequisite for submission to the post-proceedings.

TYPES 2013 is intended to be a conference in our traditional workshop
style. We expect submission of short abstracts that fit on one or two
pages, presenting in sufficient detail the content of the talk and its
relevance for TYPES, as judged by the program committee.

Submission is exclusively admitted electronically, through the
EasyChair system. The submission site is
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=types2013

Deadline for proposing a contributed talk: Monday, February 18
This means registering a submission to the EasyChair system, including
a short text-only abstract.

Deadline for the final version of the abstract: Monday, February 25
The final abstract has to be typeset in LaTeX (precise instructions
will be given on the web site) and should fit on one or two pages.
It is meant for inclusion into the abstract book.

Notification of acceptance: Friday, March 8

The conference itself: Tuesday to Friday, April 23-26, 2013

The venue: Toulouse in the South West of France is the fourth largest
city of France and a lively university center with way over 100000
students. Toulouse offers numerous inexpensive accommodations,
including student residences.

Thanks to our sponsors, notably Universit?? Toulouse 1 Capitole,
granting the lecture hall in the city center, and IRIT (Institut de
Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse) with financial support (other
sources pending), we will be able to keep the participation fee
moderate. Moreover, we will operate a scheme of additional fee
reduction for master and PhD students (details will be given later on
the web site).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Satellite event: On Monday, April 22, the twelfth international
workshop Proof, Computation, Complexity (PCC 2013) will be held
on the campus of Toulouse Technical University.

For the details, see the web site of TYPES 2013.
