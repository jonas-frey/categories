          11th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics

                         FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS
                   Extended deadline: October 15, 2015.


The 11th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics will be held in
November 2015 in conjunction with the 20th International Conference on Logic
for Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Reasoning in Suva, Fiji

We are looking for contributions describing implementation techniques for and
implementations of automated reasoning programs, theorem provers for various
logics, logic programming systems, and related technologies. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:

+ Propositional logic and decision procedures, including SMT
+ First-order and higher order logics
+ Non-classical logics, including modal, temporal, description, non-monotonic reasoning
+ Formal foundations for efficient implementation of logic
+ Data structures and algorithms for the efficient representation and processing of logical concepts
+ Proof/model search organization and heuristics for logical reasoning systems
+ Data analysis and machine learning approaches to search control
+ Techniques for proof/model search visualization and analysis
+ Practical constraint handling
+ Reasoning with ontologies and other large theories
+ Implementation of efficient theorem provers and model finders for different logics
+ System descriptions of logical reasoning systems
+ Issues of reliability, witness generation, and  witness verification
+ Evaluation and benchmarking of provers and other logic-based systems
+ I/O standards and communication between reasoning systems

We are particularly interested in contributions that help the community to
understand how to build useful and powerful reasoning systems, and how to apply
them in practice.

Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit a position
statement (2 pages), a short paper (up to 5 pages), or a full papers (up to 15
pages) via the EasyChair page for IWIL-2015,
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwil2015

Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will select a
balanced program of high-quality contributions.

Submissions should be in standard-conforming PDF. Final versions will be
required to be submitted in LaTeX using the easychair.cls class file.
Proceedings will be published as EasyChair Proceedings.

If number and quality of the submissions warrant it, we plan to produce a
special issue of a recognized journal on the topic of the workshop.

Important Dates:
+ Submission of papers/abstracts:   October 12, 2015 (extended deadline)
+ Notification of acceptance:       October 26, 2015
+ Camera ready versions due:        November 9, 2015
+ Workshop:                         November 23, 2015
