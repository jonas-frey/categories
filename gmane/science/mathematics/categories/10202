*COVID-19 Emergency*:

*Our highest priority is the safety of all participants. Due to the
covid19 pandemic, Linearity and TLLA 2020 will happen as a virtual
conference.  More details will follow when we know from the main
organizers of FSCD 2020,
athttps://fscd2020.org/2020/04/01/Virtualisation-FSCD-IJCAR-2020/

Linearity has been a key feature in several lines of research in both
theoretical and practical approaches to computer science. On the
theoretical side there is much work stemming from linear logic dealing
with proof technology, complexity classes, and more recently quantum
computation. On the practical side, there is work on program analysis,
expressive operational semantics for programming languages, linear
programming languages, program transformation, update analysis and
efficient implementation techniques.

Linear logic is not only a theoretical tool to analyse the use of
resources in logic and computation. It is also a corpus of tools,
approaches, and methodologies (proof nets, exponential decomposition,
geometry of interaction, coherent spaces, relational models, etc.) that
were originally developed for the study of linear logic's syntax and
semantics and are nowadays applied in several other fields.

The aim of this Joint Linearity and TLLA workshop is to bring together
researchers who are currently working on linear logic and related fields,
to foster their interaction and provide a forum for presenting new ideas
and work in progress. We also hope to enable newcomers to learn about curre=
nt
activities in this area. New results that make central use of linearity,
ranging from foundational work to applications in any field, are welcome.
Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open
questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories and practi=
ces.

Topics of interest include:
- theory of programming languages
- type systems
- verification
- models of computation
- implicit computational complexity
- parallelism and concurrency
- games and languages
- proof theory
- philosophy
- categories and algebra
- connections with combinatorics
- linguistics
- functional analysis and operator algebras

IMPORTANT DATES

* EXTENDED Submission deadline: 4th May 2020
* Author notification: 29th May 2020
* Contribution for Informal Proceedings: 12th June 2020
* Workshop date: 29-30 June 2020

SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited to submit:
* an extended abstract (8 pages max) describing original ideas and results
not published nor submitted elsewhere,
* or a 5-page abstract presenting relevant work that has been or will be
published elsewhere,
* or a 2-page description of work in progress.
Preliminary proceedings will be available at the workshop.
Papers should be written in English, and submitted in PDF format using the
EPTCS style files. Submission is through the Easychair website:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtllalinearity2020

POST-PROCEEDINGS

After the workshop, authors of  extended abstracts will be invited to submi=
t
a longer version of their work (typically a 15-pages paper) for publication
in EPTCS (TBC). These submissions will undergo a second round of refereeing=
.
