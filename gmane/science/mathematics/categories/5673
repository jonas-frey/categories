Dear Ross,

I have a little more time to answer your mail. I have to recall
precisely what I said about you in my long mail about "opposites via
distributors"

   (i)  Ross Street's 1980 paper: Fibrations in bicategories, where
he .. uses distributors in the enriched case, which he calls
"modules", without mentioning my name.

I have again consulted your paper, to be absolutely sure. No mention
of my name in the text, but that could be a slip, but no mention of
my paper on distibutors, which you knew of course, in the
bibliography. The only reference you give about the subject is
Lawvere' 1974 paper on "Metric spaces".
You say you are saddened, an I'm sorry about that. What about me?
Isn't there any reason why I should also be "saddened"?

I have carefully looked at the Encyclopedia papers you kindly sent
me, and I would like to make a few comments, without any "polemic
spirit"
About distributors you say, I quote you:
" There is a bicategory Mod whose objects are (small) categories and
whose arrows are modules [St5, St8] (= profunctors = distributors
[Bn2] = bimodules [L2])

What does "There is" mean? Was it "god-given", or introduce by your
two papers (1981 & 1983) or Lawvere's paper (1974)? Wouldn't  it have
been "fairer" and more accurate to say "introduced by Benabou, and
used, or developed, or whatever you want, by so and so"

Now a few more remarks: In your encyclopedia paper you say:

"There are several purely categorical motivations for the development
of bicategory theory.
The first is to study bicategories following the theory of categories
but taking into account the 2-dimensionality; .... A given concept of
category theory has several generalizations ... "

Sorry Ross, much as I respect your work, we don't seem to have the
same approach to generalizations. I introduced bicategories because I
had a huge amount of mathematically important examples. And I wanted
to have a "common denominator" explaining these examples, and others
I was sure to find. And these examples were also a guide to indicate
what meaningful "abstract notions" were to be investigated.

Let me risk a parallel. Formally, a category is "nothing but" a
monoid with many objects. Do you think that Eilenberg & Mac Lane's
motivation to introduce categories was " following the theory of
monoids" but "taking into account" the fact that they had many
objects. If they hadn't had so many mathematical examples would the
theory of monoids have indicated them that monos, epis, products,
equalizers or general limits or colimits were relevant to the study
of "monoids with many objects". Would Kan have discovered adjoint
functors if he hadn't had in mind many many important mathematical
examples? Even such "formal constructions" on categories e.g.
categories of fractions, were motivated by mathematics, not abstract
formal considerations.

You also mention a coherence theorem asserting that every bicategory
is equivalent to a 2-category. About this theorem, or the one stating
that every fibration is equivalent to a split fibration, I'm tempted,
with all due respect, to say so what? They might be interesting if we
were concerned by a single bicategory or fibration. But the natural
notion of morphism, in both cases does not respect the "stictness
properties". Thus, here again, mathematics, not  abstract formalism,
will tell me what is really important.

I apologize for such a long, and probably a bit confuse mail.

Very cordially, Jean.
