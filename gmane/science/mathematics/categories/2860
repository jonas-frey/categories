I can't remember exactly what Bill was talking about in that posting.
However, there is no hope of `parametrizing' decidable K-finite objects
by an internal category, unless the ambient topos has a natural number
object (cf. the remarks on pp. 1058-9 of "Sketches of an Elephant"), and
if it does the decidable K-finites are exactly the objects locally
isomorphic to finite cardinals. So I suspect that he was referring to
the internal category of finite cardinals.

Yes, of course -- this is exactly the geometric intuition behind this
use of "locally". One needs to assume that P is stable under arbitrary
pullback (which will certainly be the case if it's expressible in the
internal language of a topos). Then, in any topos generated by
subterminals (in particular, in any topos of sheaves on a space),
every cover Z -->> 1 is dominated by one of the form
\coprod_i U_i -->> 1, where the U_i are a family of subterminals
covering 1 in the classical sense. So P holds locally for Y iff it
holds for the restriction of Y to each member of some cover in
the classical sense.
