Dear Colleagues,
  Below is the first announcement about MFPS XX. The meeting will take place
on the CMU campus in May, co-located with the annual ASL meeting that also
will be held on the CMU campus. All interested parties are invited to submit
contributed talks for the open sessions of the meeting.
  Best regards,
  Mike Mislove

=======================================================

                 FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT
                     MFPS 20
             Twentieth Workshop on the
    Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics
             Carnegie Mellon University
                 May 23 - 26, 2004

    Co-located with Annual Association of Symbolic Logic Meeting

The twentieth workshop on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming
Semantics will take place on the campus on Carnegie Mellon University,
Pittsburgh, PA USA from May 23 through May 26, 2004. This year, the
conference is co-locating with the annual meeting of the Association
of Symbolic Logic. For more information about the annual ASL meeting,
see http://www.aslonline.org/

The goals of the MFPS series have been to provide a forum for
researchers in all areas surrounding semantics to present their latest
research results, and to improve communication and interactions
between mathematicians, logicians and computer scientists who work in
these areas. The areas of relevance include category theory, domain
theory, logic and topology on the mathematics side, and type theory,
semantics, and the design, verification and implementation of
programming languages on the computer science side. The meetings
alternate between a large conference format featuring invited speakers
and refereed, contributed papers, on the one hand, and more informal
workshops featuring survey talks by invited speakers and contributed
talks by researchers about their latest research, on the other. MFPS
XX is a workshop year, and so we will follow the workshop format,
including contributed talks by participants (see below).

MFPS XX will feature six invited, plenary talks, each with a
complementary special session on a topic closely related to the
interests of the speaker. The plenary speakers are:

     Christel Baier (Bonn)
     Radha Jagadeesan (DePaul)
     Pat Lincoln (SRI)
     Luke Ong (Oxford)
     Dana Scott (CMU) - Joint ASL/MFPS Lecture
     Alex Simpson (Edinburgh)

As indicated, each of these talks will be followed by a special
session. These sessions and their organizers are:

  Model checking - organized by Professor Baier and Prakash Panagaden (McGill)
  Hybrid systems - organized by Professor Jagadeesan, Michael Mislove (Tulane)
                   and Prakash Panagaden
  Security - organized by Dr. Lincoln and Dr. Catherine Meadows (NRL)
  Game Theory and Semantics - organized by Dr. Ong, Stephen Brookes (CMU)
                              and Michael Mislove
  Domain Theory - organized by Steve Awodey (CMU)
  Topology and Domain Theory - organized by Dr. Simpson and Achim
                               Jung (Birmingham)

In addition to the plenary talks and sessions, the program will
include talks contributed by the participants. Those interested in
participating in the meeting by contributing a talk are invited to
send a title and short abstract to the email address
mfps@math.tulane.edu If a participant believes his or her talk is
appropriate to one of the special sessions, then this should be noted
in the email message. Slots for talks will be allocated on a first
come, first served basis.

MFPS is organized by Stephen Brookes (CMU), Achim Jung (Birmingham),
Catherine Meadows (NRL), Michael Mislolve (Tulane) and Prakash
Panagaden (McGill). The local arrangements for MFPS XX will be
overseen by Professor Brookes.  More information about MFPS XX will be
available on the home page,
http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps20.html when it is available. In
particular, information about lodging, conference registration, and
possible support will be announced there and by additional emails. We
anticipate support from the US Office of Naval Research, and component
of this usually includes support for women, minorities and graduate
students who wish to participate in the meeting.
