                     CALL FOR PAPERS

                   The 11th workshop on
              Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)

                  June 4-6, Kyoto, Japan

          http://www-mmm.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/qpl2014


The 11th workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL) will take place
at Kyoto University, Japan, from 4th to 6th, JUNE 2014.

This workshop will bring together researchers working on mathematical
foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing and spatio-temporal
causal structures, and in particular those that use logical tools,
ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages,
semantical methods and other computer science methods for the study of
physical behaviour in general.

Previous QPL events were held in Ottawa (2003), Turku (2004), Chicago
(2005), Oxford (2006),Reykjavik (2008), Oxford (2009), Oxford (2010),
Nijmegen (2011), Brussels (2012) and Barcelona (2013).



INVITED SPEAKERS

Giulio Chiribella (Tsinghua)
Masahito "Hassei" Hasegawa (Kyoto)
Masanao Ozawa (Nagoya)




IMPORTANT DATES

Submission Deadline: 13th Apr, 2014
Notification of Acceptance: 4th May
Papers Ready: 11th May
Workshop: 4th-6th June




SUBMISSIONS

Prospective speakers are invited to submit a contribution to the workshop.

  - *Short contributions* consist of a 3 page description of the work,
    and a link to a paper published elsewhere.

  - Longer *original contributions* consist of a 5-12 page extended
    abstract which provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine
    interest and provides sufficient detail to allow the program
    committee to assess the merits of the work. Submissions of works in
    progress are encouraged but must be more substantial than a
    research proposal.

Extended versions of accepted original research contributions will be
published in Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science
(EPTCS) after the workshop. Selected contributions will further be
invited to a special issue in the journal New Generation Computing.

Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX (use of the EPTCS style is
encouraged), and must be submitted in PDF format. Submission is done
via EasyChair: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qpl2014




TRAVEL SUPPORT

We encourage participation by graduate students. Students will pay a
reduced registration fee. We will also provide limited financial
support to students for travel and accommodations (non-students can
also apply but priority is given to students). Further information is
found on the workshop website.
