Well Michael, I do not have at hand your original post. What I do remember of
that post is that you ask for an english translation of the word
"aboutissement", not for a translation a whole sentence containing that word.

In my whole experience reading mathematics written in english, I do not
remember to have seen the word "abutment".

On the other hand, I am tired of reading spanish translations (from english or
french or russian) of mathematical texts where single words are replaced by
their spanish translations, and the result is completely alien to standard
mathematical spanish.

Does the word "abutment" belong to standard mathematical english ?

Eduardo.
