As Peter J. is saying, categories of relations have poor (co)limits.
For abelian groups, Rel(Ab) does not even have products (sums).

However, if you insert the 2-category Rel  into the double category =20
RRel of sets, mappings and relations [GP1]
you have a double category with all double limits and colimits.
For instance: the obvious cartesian product  a x b: XxY --> X' x =20
Y'  (resp. sum  a + b: X+Y --> X' + Y')  of two relations a, b
is indeed a product (resp, a sum) in the double category.
oSee [GP] for definitions and discussion of these aspects.

Similarly, many bicategories of spans, cospans, relations, =20
profunctors... have poor (co)limits, but can be usefully embedded in
weak double categories (with the same objects, "strict morphisms", =20
"same morphisms", suitable double cells) that have all limits
and colimits.

Also adjoints work well in the extended settings: see [GP2].

Best regards

Marco
