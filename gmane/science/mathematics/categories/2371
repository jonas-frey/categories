Dear All

This is an announcement about a forthcoming research position at Bangor.

 The full announcement will appear on the web at : www.jobs.ac.uk within
the next few days.  The post is for 10 months only as the funding is for a
Pilot project and one of the tasks for the Research Assistant will be to
help in the preparation of an extended proposal.

Please draw it to the attention of  any suitable candidates.

Thanks

Tim Porter

PS. for people outside the U.K. If you don't know North Wales, it is a
beautiful area of the U.K. and the School Of Informatics is very near the
sea and the mountains!!!!

UNIVERSITY  OF  WALES,  BANGOR

SCHOOL  OF  INFORMATICS
MATHEMATICS  DIVISION

Research  Officer
(Fractafolds, their geometry and topology)

Salary:  =A318,265 -  =A320,311 (on R&A Grade 1A) p.a.

Applications are invited for the above Leverhulme funded Pilot Project
post available for a period of 10 months.

Based in the Mathematics Division of the School of Informatics, you will
work on the problem of identifying a class of topological spaces that bear
something of the same relationship to certain well structured fractal
spaces as manifolds bear to Euclidean spaces.  This is a pilot project to
evaluate various candidate classes of spaces for =91fractafold=92 status.
The candidate spaces are fractal, but also are, in various different ways
=91homogeneously fractal=92.  The test for success will be indications
that a possible fractal analogue of differential geometry can be applied
to the study of these spaces.  Thus you will study the various classes of
candidate spaces to see if the development of such a =91differential
geometry=92 on fractals impo= ses
extra conditions on them or distinguishes between the different
candidate
classes.

Dependent on the success of this initial testing, it is hoped that a
full-scale project lasting a further two years will be awarded.  One of
your tasks will be to assist the project coordinator in the preparation of
full grant applications.

You should possess a strong mathematical background (PhD) with research
experience in one or more of the following areas:  fractals;  algebraic,
geometric or differential topology;  areas of analysis, or differential
geometry;  category theory;  or certain relevant areas of mathematical
physics (finite approximation theory, discrete differential manifolds,
etc.) or theoretical computer science (digital topology, constructive
analysis, etc.).

Application forms and further particulars should be obtained by

Please quote reference number 03-2/231 when applying.  Closing date for
applications: Friday 25th July, 2003.  Interviews will be held in early
September, 2003.

Informal enquiries can be made by contacting Professor T. Porter,
