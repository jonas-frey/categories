I guess I misunderstood what you meant by "elementary".  You wanted a
single statement that can be expressed in the internal logic of the
topos?  Many other properties that people refer to as "elementary",
such as the existence of finite limits or power objects, are defined
by quantifying over all objects and morphisms of the category in
question.  Is AC "elementary"?

one internalize the notion of a stack? It comes down to parametrizing all e=
pimorphisms in the topos itself.
