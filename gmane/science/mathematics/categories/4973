Dear Ellis,

I have asked Prof. Yoneda many years ago why Yoneda Lemma is
called "Lemma", not "Theorem". He said that perhaps it was a
bit about internal of category theory rather than insisting
on applications to other mathematics. Doesn't Yoneda Lemma
satisfy (c) in Mile Gould's post? I don't know how much
Yoneda Lemma is useful in other areas of mathematics, and
I have wanted to know it.
