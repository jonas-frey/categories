Call the category you describe D.  There is an obvious functor C --> D
which inverts the morphisms of S.  So there is an induced functor
C[S^{-1}] --> D, which is the identity on objects and is clearly full,
since the morphisms from A to B in C[S^{-1}] can be described as the
*formal* composites g_1.f_1^{-1}.....f_n^{-1}.g_{n+1} (modulo certain
relations), where g_1,...,g_{n+1}, are morphisms of C and f_1,...,f_n
morphisms in S.

The question is whether the functor C[S^{-1}] --> D is faithful.

I suspect that this is true in general, but can only prove it if
you restrict yourself to CW-complexes with a finite number of cells.
If you do this, then I believe that the reverse Ore condition holds:
given
        s
     A ---> B
     |
     v
     C

with s in S, there exists

        s
     A ---> B
     |      |
     v      v
     C ---> D
        t

with t in S.  (B is just A with a finite number of vertices added;
just add the images of those points in C as new vertices to get D.)

With this, it isn't hard to see that the functor is faithful.

For infinite CW-complexes, this Ore condition doesn't hold, but I
still suspect that the functor is faithful.  In part it depends upon
what you mean by "orientation preserving".  Does this mean "having a
'positive' derivative at all times"?  Or 'non-negative'?  Or can the
map go forwards and backwards as long as overall it has degree one?
