Dear George,

I appreciate very much your pioneer work on Galois theories and the =
developments you and others have given to that work.
I also believe in the role of analogies in mathematics, and I think =
category theory is the ideal place where one can give the DEEP analogies =
a mathematical content.
However, in this case, the analogy seems to me totally superficial, =
namely: two classes A and B of maps in a category X, and the possibility =
to factor every map f of X as ab, with a in A and b in B.=20

This won't go very far since you need some axioms on the pair (A,B) to =
start proving anything except trivialities. And, I tried to explain in =
my previous mail, the properties of pairs (E,M) and (V,K) are so =
radically different that a common denominator would be reduced to almost =
nothing.

Even more important to me, cartesian functors are a very good notion of =
morphism between pairs (V,K) and (v',K')  which you can prove non =
trivial results, the theorem in my mail is only an example of such =
results. As far as I know there is no notion of morphism between pairs =
(E,M) and (E',M').

Let me point out some features of cartesian functors F: X --X' , viewed =
abstractly as morphisms (V,K) --> (V',K')  where V =3D V(P),  K =3D =
K(P),  V' =3D V(P') and K' =3D K(P').
1) F preserves vertical end cartesian maps. This is harmless, but F also =
REFLECTS vertical maps.
2) We assume that every map of X can be factored as kv, but we make no =
such assumption on X'
3) The very nature of the results: For any important properties, F =
satisfies globally the property iff it satisfies it fiberwise.

If any reasonable notion of morphism of pairs (E,M) was defined someday =
would reflection of maps in M be considered? Would one accept that =
(E',M') should not be a factorization system even in a very weak sense?
And if non trivial results could be obtained about such notion would =
some kind of fibers play a role?

Sorry George, much as I like unifying notions and theories, I cannot see =
any real, non trivial, relation between factorization systems and (pre =
folations + cartesian functors)
I insist on the second term of the previous symbolic addition.
There would be a lot more to say about indexed versus fibered, but you =
already know my opinion about that. Moreover indexed is totally =
irrelevant here becausethere is no reindexing for pre foliations

Best regards,
Jean

> Dear Jean,
>=20
> Talking about the comparison, I had in mind mainly the following: the =
vertical-cartesian factorization for a fibration is closely related to =
the reflective factorization system for a semi-left-exact reflection =
(one might vaguely say "they are the same up to an isomorphism under the =
assumptions used in both of them").
>=20
> Concerning the older discussion on fibrations versus indexed =
categories: Please believe me that I fully agree with every instance of =
"fibrations are better" you mention. Nevertheless I also agree with =
"indexed categories are better", in a different sense. The reason I am =
saying this now is that I would like to mention semi-left-exact =
reflections of Cassidy--Hebert--Kelly and their generalizations as a =
THIRD APPROACH (I used them independently calling them "admissible" in =
Galois theory, first exactly in 1984).
