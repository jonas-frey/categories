Fred: Yes! In (Vect, k) and (Haus, 1), this number identifies the
cardinality of an object's "dense" subset, for the correct notion of
"dense" in either category. More precisely, for ordinary
(non-enriched) categories, the choice of a point object I gives a
canonical choice of forgetful functor U := hom(I, --) into Set. Then,
point cardinality is the set cardinality of the smallest set Q that
satisfies the usual unique lifting condition: for e : Q --> UX, f : Q
--> UY, if there exists a map g : X --> Y such that f = (Ug)e then g
is unique. From this point of view, it seems Vect is a bit of a
degenerate example, because all vector spaces are free over some set
and unique lifting is just the universal property of the right adjoint
U.

David: Hmm... Yes, it seems like there's a lot of choices here on how
you can use distinguishing points to pull out invariants of the
category or objects in the category. Here's one: for a category C,
form a category C+ whose objects are minimal sets of points { p : I
--> X } and whose arrows S --> S' are maps f in C s.t. for p in S, f o
s is in S'. This category C+ has fewer arrows but many more objects.
There is also a canonical functor Q : C+ --> C that creates isos. The
question is, does this have interesting properties?

Take Z(C) and Z(C+) as the largest sub-groupoids of C and C+
respectively. Since Q creates isos, it restricts to an equivalence of
categories Q' : Z(C+) --> Z(C). Z(C+) a new groupoid with
"non-trivial" iso's unrolled. I.e. the only automorphisms in Z(C+) are
permutations of distinguishing points.
