I think we should say it publicly.  Gays get to have gay pride, why
shouldn't categorists get to have category-theory pride?  Perhaps
we've just been in the closet too long.  I think it's the right thing
to do to explain to people that this stuff is interesting and
worthwhile to us.

Worst of all would be to let the fear of shame keep us from saying
what we hold as true.  If I consider category theory to be good,
beautiful, valid math, then I shouldn't be shy about saying as much.
If someone else doesn't consider it to be "real math," he or she can
challenge me -- I'm up for that discussion.  The worst they can do is
not give me a job, but this is not an issue because I don't belong at
a place that doesn't respect category theory.

Andre is right -- category theory is probably the most important
mathematical developpement of the 20th century.
