                              CONCUR'06
          17th International Conference on Concurrency Theory
                       August 27th - 30th, 2006
                           Bonn, Germany

CONCUR 2006, the  17th International Conference on Concurrency Theory,
will take place in Bonn, Germany, August 27 - 30, 2006. The purpose of
the CONCUR conferences is to bring together researchers working on the
theory of concurrency and its applications.

Submissions  are  solicited in  all  areas  of  semantics, logics, and
verification techniques  for  concurrent systems. The principal topics
include (but are not limited to):

* Basic  models  and  logics of concurrent and distributed computation
  (such as process  algebras,  Petri  nets, domain  theoretic  or game
  theoretic models, modal and temporal logics).

* Specialized models or classes of systems (such as circuits, synchro-
  nous systems, real time and hybrid systems, stochastic systems, data
  bases, mobile and  migrating systems, parametric protocols, security
  protocols).

* Related  verification  techniques and tools (such as state-space ex-
  ploration,  model-checking,  synthesis,  abstraction,  automated de-
  duction, testing).

* Related programming models  (such as distributed, constraints or ob-
  ject oriented,  graph rewriting, as well as associated type systems,
  static analyses, abstract machines, and environments).

Authors  are  invited to submit an extended abstract; submissions will
be  evaluated  by  the  program  committee  for  inclusion in the pro-
ceedings,  which  will be published by Springer-Verlag  in the Lecture
Notes  in  Computer Science series. Papers must  contain original con-
tributions, be clearly  written, and  include appropriate reference to
and comparison with related work. Simultaneous  submission to journals
or other conferences with published proceedings is not allowed.

Authors are required to submit a paper title  and a short abstract be-
fore submitting  the extended abstract. The short abstract  should not
exceed 200 words, and it should be entered  in ASCII at the conference
web site.  The extended abstract  should not  exceed 15 pages,  and it
should be  formatted according  to Springer-Verlag LNCS guidelines. If
necessary, the  extended abstract  may be  supplemented with a clearly
marked appendix,  which will be reviewed at the discretion of the pro-
gram committee. The link for submission will be  available at the web-
site: http://depend.cs.uni-sb.de/concur06
