Yes, this is precisely what one does in formalising category=20
theory in an (intensional) dependent type theory. (Mike=20
Shulman has alluded to this in a previous message to this=20
list.)

Since in such a type theory one does not have quotients of=20
equivalence relations, one typically works not with raw types=20
but with setoids (=3Dtypes equipped with an equivalence=20
relation in the internal logic).

The category of such setoids is well behaved---at least an=20
LCC pretopos---but the notion of internal category in this=20
pretopos is generally not what one is interested in.

Instead one takes a category internal to the type theory to=20
be given by a type of objects O, together with an OxO indexed=20
family of hom-setoids O(x,y), composition and identities=20
which are maps of setoids, and associativity and unitality=20
witnessed by elements of the hom-setoid equality. In this=20
setting, we may not talk of equality of objects (since O is=20
not a setoid but only a type) but may talk of the equality of=20
any pair of parallel arrows.

This notion is due to Peter Aczel and there is a fairly=20
extensive development of it in the proof assistant Coq by=20
G=E9rard Huet and Amokrane Sa=EFbi. Some consequences of the=20
definition are, e.g., that the collection of all small=20
categories does no longer forms a category, but only a=20
bicategory (since one cannot speak of equality of functors,=20
since this would require equality of objects in the=20
codomain). Some work on this has been done by Olov Wilander.

Since the category of sets is a model of extensional, and so=20
also intensional, type theory, one may interpret what the=20
above means in this context to obtain, within a classical (or=20
at least impredicative) metatheory, a notion of category=20
meeting your requirements. In fact such non-standard=20
categories may be seen as special kinds of tricategory (in=20
the usual sense).

Indeed, in the set-based model of type theory, a setoid is=20
given by a set X; for each pair of elements x,y in X, a=20
further set X(x,y); and arrows of composition X(y,z) x=20
X(x,y)-->X(x,z), inverse X(x,y)-->X(y,x) and identity=20
1-->X(x,x) subject to no axioms. But this is precisely to=20
give a bigroupoid which is locally chaotic, in the sense that=20
between any two parallel 1-cells, there is a unique 2-cell.=20
[From a constructive perspective, not every such bigroupoid=20
would be "OK". The constructively valid ones would be the=20
cofibrant ones, since these may be inductively generated.]

From=20this it follows without difficulty that a category in=20
the constructive sense is precisely a tricategory (in the=20
sense of Gordon-Power-Street) whose every hom-bicategory is a=20
locally chaotic bigroupoid.

The use of these non-standard categories is pertinent with=20
regard to Bill Lawvere's comments on the distinction between=20
presentations and the things (theories) that they present.=20
There is a model structure on the category FPCat of small=20
categories with chosen finite products and strict=20
product-preserving maps whose cofibrant objects are, up to=20
retracts, the (many-sorted) Lawvere theories. One may define,=20
in a similar way, a category FPCat' whose objects are=20
non-standard categories with finite products, and whose=20
morphisms are strict structure-preserving maps: and on this=20
there is a model structure (or at least the=20
cofibration-trivial fibration half of a model structure)=20
whose cofibrant objects are "equational presentations of=20
Lawvere theories": one has not only the sorts, and the=20
generating operations, but also the generating equalities=20
between composite operations. There is an adjunction between=20
FPCat and FPCat' which is the left-hand of the two=20
adjunctions described by Bill.
