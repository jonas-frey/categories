*********************** Call for papers =
***************************************
* Mathematical Structures in Computer Science - Special issue
* "=46rom Type Theory and Homotopy Theory to Univalent Foundations"
* Deadline for submissions: December 31st, 2012

BACKGROUND

Over the last few years, there has been significant progress in relating
type theory with homotopy theory and higher-dimensional category theory.
These advances have stimulated a new wave of research in type theory, in
which ideas of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science are
often combined with geometric intuition in an original way.

In particular, the Univalent Foundations programme formulated by =
Vladimir
Voevodsky seeks to develop a new approach to the foundations of
mathematics on the basis of type theories that combine the good
computational properties of Martin-L=F6f type theories and the Calculus =
of
Inductive Constructions with new axioms inspired by homotopy theory, =
such
as the Univalence Axiom.

AIMS AND SCOPE

The aim of the special issue is to provide a comprehensive and timely
account of the state of the art in this new area of research, thus
providing a basis for future developments.

We welcome submissions from participants in the several conferences and
workshops on these topics that are occurring this year or have occurred =
in
the past few years.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited, to:

- homotopical semantics of type theories
- semantics of type theories in higher categories
- syntactic and semantic aspects of identity types
- syntactic and semantic aspects of the Univalence Axiom
- development of Univalent Foundations
- related issues and challenges in computer-assisted proof-checking
- representation of homotopical and higher categorical structures in =
type theory
- related applications of polynomial/container functors.

SUBMISSION

The deadline for submissions is December 31st, 2012.

Papers should be submitted as pdf attachments with an email to one of =
the
editors.

EDITORS

The special issue will be edited by

Steve Awodey (Carnegie Mellon University)
Nicola Gambino (University of Palermo)
Erik Palmgren (University of Stockholm)

With best wishes,

Steve=
