Dear all,

I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that applications for the
European Master's Program in Computational Logic are possible UNTIL 5
June 2016.

More details are given below.

Please spread this information as wide as possible among friends and
colleagues, at your old universities and the places, where you currently
live and work.

Many thanks -- Steffen

We are glad to announce to you the possibility to join our European
Master's Program of Computational Logic. This program is offered jointly
at the Free-University of Bozen-Bolzano in Italy, the Technische
Universit??t Dresden in Germany, the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in
Portugal and the Technische Universit??t Wien in Austria. Within this
program you have the choice to study at two /three of the four European
universities. In addition, you can do your project work at the National
