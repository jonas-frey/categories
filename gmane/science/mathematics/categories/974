           PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC
               70th meeting -- First Announcement

The 70th meeting of the PSSL will be held in Cambridge on the weekend of
27-28 February 1999. As usual, we welcome contributed talks on any aspect
of category theory, sheaf theory or related areas of logic and computer
science.

It is planned to make this meeting into a celebration of the 60th birthday
of Gavin Wraith, which falls in March 1999. Gavin has been involved with
the PSSL since its inception in 1976, and we hope that his many friends 
will wish to join us in celebrating this occasion.

Further details of the arrangements for the meeting, and a registration
form, will be sent out in January.

                                           Peter Johnstone
                                           Martin Hyland
