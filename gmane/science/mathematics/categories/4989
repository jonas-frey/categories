Hmm. Not sure if you mean you're allowing any full subcategory of
[J^op,Set]; if so then you should drop the requirement that J-->C be fully
faithful.

No. The category Setf of finite sets has a fully faithful dense inclusion in
to the (presheaf) category Set of all sets, but Set is not [Setf^op,Set].
