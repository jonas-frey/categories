i know, of course, that jan rutten developed theory of power series to a =

the query on the list concerned the function=20

really work on such things? i would be really interested in that.

i used to think that it might be worth while to rework widder's book on =
transform theory coalgebraically. but even the coalgebraic laplace =

thought no one noticed it. it would be good to know that it was further =

all the best,
