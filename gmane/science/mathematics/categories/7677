Dear Thomas, Dear all,

My definition of poset is: "preordered set". I don't know if there is a =
general agreement, since some answers seemed to suppose that I meant =
"partially ordered set". It is because I feared this confusion that i =
specified by adding: equivalent to a discrete category.=20
Of course I knew that they were "equivalence relations", and had also =
many other simple characterizations. One which I like and need is: X is =
equivalent to a discrete category iff the functor X --> 1 is faithful  =
and conservative (i.e. reflects isos) because it has the following =
generalization:

Let P: X --> S be a prefibration. The following are equivalent:
(i) P is equivalent to a discrete fibration.
(ii) P is faithful and consevative.
(iii) each fiber of P is equivalent to a discrete category.

Thus my question  was not:  what are such categories, for which I knew =
perfectly many answers, but : is there a well established name for them?=20=

Suggestions such as "setoids" or "essentially discrete" show that this =
is not the case.

I don't like very much "setoids", and I am very tempted by "essentially =
discrete" as Thomas suggested.=20
But I shall make my question a bit more difficult.=20
What would you call a category X such that the functor X --> 1 is full =
and faithful? Please don't tell me what they are, I  know that. I'm not =
even asking if there is a we'll established name for them. I don't think =
there is one. What I ask is: Could you suggest one? Preferably a name =
which would be suitable when we work with categories internal to a Topos =
E where supports don't split.

As a side remark, let me say that I don't care very much for the =
distinction between "evil" and "non evil". Apart  from obvious moral or =
philosophical reasons, for the following purely mathematical one: =
Non-evilness depends on the notion of equivalence of categories. And =
this in turn may heavily depend on which notion of equivalence you =
chose. And some of these notions depend on the axiom of choice, which I =
might be tempted to call "evil". Thus we'd reach the following =
conclusion:=20
Non evil is essentially evil.=20
I rather like this conclusion, don't you?

Best regards,
Jean
