Many thanks for all the immediate replies and all the interesting
information.

Finally, I could also reconstruct today where I have seen the
arrows-only definition around 30 years ago. There is a four page
introduction into categories in the first chapter of P.M. Cohn's
"Universal Algebra". He outlines that one could do so and gives a
corresponding exercise.
