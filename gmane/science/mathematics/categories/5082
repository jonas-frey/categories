Dear Dimitri,

I think that finding useful necessary and sufficient conditions in general
is a very hard problem. But here is something that might be useful in
specific cases.

There will exist some faithful functor G:C-->D sending alpha to a colimit
cocone if and only if the universal functor G:C-->D sending alpha to
a colimit cocone is faithful. This universal functor can be constructed
as follows (this forms part of the general theory of sketches).

Let M be the full subcategory of [C^op,Set] consisting of those functors
F which send alpha to a limit cone. Then M is reflective in [C^op,Set],
via a left adjoint L, and the composite LY:C-->M does indeed send alpha
to a colimit cocone. The universal G is obtained by factorizing LY as
a bijective on objects functor G:C-->D followed by a fully faithful
J:D-->M.

Clearly G will be faithful if and only if LY is, and this can be determined
once one has calculated L on representables. Calculating L explicitly
is in general still a hard problem, but in specific cases you may be able to
do it sufficiently explicitly to solve your problem.

The connection with sketches is that you can think of your cocone as giving
a limit sketch on C^op, then the category M defined above is the category of
models of the sketch.

Regards,

Steve Lack.
