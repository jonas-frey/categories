Thanks to everyone who replied to my email.  The consensus from people
who claim to know (although there were some plausible guesses) is that
the name is by analogy with "distributions" from functional analysis,
which are "generalized functions."  Thus changing "ion" to "or" we get
that "distributors" are "generalized functors."
