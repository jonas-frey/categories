Dear friends and colleagues,

This is a reminder that a conference "Type Theory, Homotopy Theory and Univ=
alent Foundations" will be held at the Centre de Recerca Matematica in Barc=
elona on September 23rd-27th.

The invited speakers are:

- Richard Garner, Macquarie University, Australia
- Andre' Joyal, UQAM, Montr=E9al, Canada
- Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine, IAS, Princeton, USA
- Thomas Streicher, Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Germany
- Michael Warren, IAS, Princeton, USA

The registration is now open and we also welcome submission of abstracts fo=
r presentations. The deadline for submitting abstracts is July 1st.

There is some available support for graduate students, postdoctoral researc=
hers and young academics. Thanks to NSF funding, additional support for you=
ng researchers based at US institutions is also available. The deadline for=
  application for support is July 14th, 2013.

For further information, please see the conference webpage:

The following activities may also be of interest:=20

- during the week preceeding the conference (September 16th-20th), Peter Le=
Fanu Lumsdaine will give a series of preparatory lectures at the Universita=
t de Barcelona on homotopy theory in type theory.

- during the weekend following the conference (September 28th-29th), there =
will be the yearly Barcelona Topology Workshop.

With best regards,
