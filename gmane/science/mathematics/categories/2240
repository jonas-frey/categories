practical topics in computer science that relate to logic in a broad
sense. The conference is intended to emphasize the relevance of logic
to computer science.

The program of LICS 2003 features 4 invited talks, 2 invited tutorials,
34 contributed papers, and 14 short presentations.

Invited Talks:

  - Erich Graedel (RWTH Aachen):
    "Will deflation lead to depletion? On non-monotone fixed point inductions"

  - John Harrison (Intel Corp.): "Formal verification at Intel"

  - Marta Kwiatkowska (U. Birmingham)
    "Model checking for probability and time: from theory to practice"

  - John McCarthy (Stanford U.)
    "Advice about nonmonotonic reasoning in AI"

Invited Tutorials:
