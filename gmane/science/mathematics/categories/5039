Quite right, I should have used something other than "lemma" for that
weaker statement.  Misplaced force of habit.

Googling "Theorem 5.1 (Yoneda)" returns section 5, on full completeness,
of Phil Scott's nice Handbook of Algebra chapter.  Phil introduces that
section with "The most basic representation theorem of all is the Yoneda
embedding: Theorem 5.1 (Yoneda) If J is locally small, the Yoneda
functor Y: J --> [J^op,Set], where Y(j) = J(-,j), is a fully faithful
embedding."

(Phil's A is my J, which I'll use throughout as the base whether small
or not in order to make it easier to compare theorems.)

If "theorem" is good enough for Phil it's good enough for me.  For
definiteness let's name the theorems as follows.

YT (Yoneda Theorem): [J^op,Set] fully extends J.

YL (Yoneda Lemma): For any functor F: J^op --> Set and object j of J,
F(j) is in bijection with [J^op,Set](J(-,j),F).  (This replaces C in
Steve's version with J^op.)

DYT (Dense Yoneda Theorem):  C is equivalent to a category of presheaves
on a *small* category J if and only if C densely extends J.

Here a category of presheaves on J means a full subcategory of
[J^op,Set] containing the functors J(-,j) for all objects j of J (that
is, "on J" qualifies not just the individual presheaves but the whole
category of them, as in "free group on X"(*)).  C densely extends J just
when there exists a full, faithful, and dense functor K: J --> C.  (If
someone has a use for a broader notion of dense extension I wouldn't
object to saying "fully densely extends.")

For now assume "dense" is defined as in X.6 of CWM, namely that every
object of C arises as a colimit of FP for the evident functor P: (K,c)
--> J, (K,c) being the comma category whose morphisms are of the form
Kj-->c, j in ob(J).  (I'll consider equivalent ways of defining density
in a followup message.)  This has the effect of representing each object
c of C as the presheaf C(K-,c): J^op --> Set (namely C(Kj,c) is the set
of morphisms of (K,c) of the form Kj-->c) and each homset C(c,d) as
[J^op,Set](C(K-,c),C(K-,d)) (that is, Nat(C(K-,c),C(K-,d)) in the CWM
notation Steve is using), via the adjunction defining "colimit."

The homsets [J^op,Set](J(-,j),F) used by YL (and hence YT) are always
small even if J isn't.  DYT however deals with arbitrary homsets
[J^op,Set](F,G), which may be large when J is, whence DYT's requirement
that J be small.  (Steve Lack would be the person to ask what form DYT
might take for large J.)

The applicability of YL and YT to large J makes them incomparable with
DYT.  However if we require J to be small then we have YT < YL < DYT in
the sense that each of them represents entities by using progressively
more of [J^op,Set].  YT uses just the image of the Yoneda embedding to
represent J, YL takes one step beyond YT by using all the homsets from
that image to an arbitrary presheaf in [J^op,Set] to represent carriers
of algebras with unary operations (aka presheaves), and DYT takes one
more step than YL by using homsets between more general presheaves of
[J^op,Set] to represent *all* homsets of C.

Replacing "equivalent to" by "representable as" in DYT makes more
explicit the sense in which DYT is unambiguously a representation
theorem for certain abstractly defined categories, namely dense
extensions of a small category, which are of greater generality than the
categories contemplated in YT or YL.

I would only buy that reasoning for small J (otherwise why should G^F be
a functor to Set?), where YL isn't benefiting from the additional
generality of YL over DYT.  Is there any other reason to prefer YL to
DYT?  It doesn't seem a very natural candidate for theorem-hood (perhaps
that's why it's relegated to the status of a lemma).  It's hard to argue
for it as the fundamental theorem of CT when it's sandwiched in between
YT and DYT, both of which *do* come across as real theorems (the reason
I'm comfortable calling both of them theorems).  Anyone remember the
history of why YL rose to the top?

Don't underestimate the power of the converse.  YL < DYT because it's
only a partial converse, DYT is the whole thing.

The colimit-based definition of dense functor shows that this is pretty
much equivalent to DYT and therefore stronger than YL in what I take to
be the sense in which you consider YL stronger than YT. (Is there a
stronger sense of "stronger," e.g. a natural nonstandard model in which
YT is true and YL false, or YL true and DYT false?)

Michael Shulman's comment about the enriched case is apropos here:
defining cocompletion for conical (co)limits isn't sufficient when V
doesn't permit them (for want of diagonal functors).  This limitation
can be avoided with left Kan extensions as treated in Chapter 4 of
Kelly, "Basic Concepts of Enriched Category Theory."  Kelly arrives at
the notion of free cocompletion 15 pages into Chapter 4 and long after
indexed (nowadays weighted) colimits (Chapter 3) as a satisfactory
generalization of conical colimits.

(Incidentally, of what use are non-free cocompletions?  Is there any
reason not to define "cocompletion" to make it free?  I seem to recall
people being happy to drop "free" in this context.  Who ordered "free"?)

This post is quite long enough already so I'll stop it here with the
interesting question (to me anyway), what is the earliest point in the
development of (ordinary or unenriched) category theory at which one can
introduce either cocompletion or density in order to have functors that
are dense, full, and faithful?  Can either be usefully introduced before
functor categories, for example?  And can this be done with sufficient
generality to carry over essentially unchanged to the enriched case?  I
imagine this would reduce to just avoiding conical colimits.
