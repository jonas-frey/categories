Dear People,

The following revisions of talks on work in progress may be of
interest.

<from.dvi.gz> From NNO to Complexity (12 pages, October 2, 1997).  We
begin to revisit space complexity by collapsing resolutions to maps.
So we evolve our talk `Presenting LCC Categories by Answering Queries'
by stratifying higher order types and allowing alternatives.

<lcc-ans.dvi.gz> Presenting LCC Categories by Answering Queries (15
pages, October 1, 1997).  We present LCC categories in a manner that
provides a basis for logic programming with dependent types and
equality.  We find that resolutions are left fractions which collapse
to the maps.

They are linked to http://www.mcs.net/~quant/ .
