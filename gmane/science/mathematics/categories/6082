Start by reading the above book together with Cheng and Lauda's "Higher
categories: an illustrated guidebook":

http://www.cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/guidebook/

and Leinster's "A Survey of Definitions of n-Category":

http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0107188

Then try Lurie's "Higher Topos Theory":

http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608040

They're all free online!

Expect to spend a decade on this stuff.  Or, wait two decades for people to
polish it up, and then spend half a decade learning the basics and half a
decade learning what people have done in the next two decades.  That may be
more efficient.

Is there a definitive definition of omega-categories somewhere in the

There are *several* definitions that are almost surely "right" and likely to
be studied for many years hence.  There is no particular reason to expect
that one definition will be best for all applications - but there's a lot of
reason to expect that all the "right" definitions will be shown to be
equivalent (in a rather subtle sense).

You should learn to love simplicial sets - they're way too important to
avoid!

If for some reason you're allergic to simplicial sets, you might like
Batanin's definition of omega-categories.   But then you need to like
operads.  You could state it without operads, but then it becomes quite
long.

The book by Cheng and Lauda takes various definitions and makes them less
scary by illustrating how they work with lots of pictures.

You could say that's the basic idea behind Batanin's definition.
