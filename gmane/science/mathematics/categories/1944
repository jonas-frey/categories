the view of (quasi)metric spaces as R+-categories with the hom-objects
d(x,y) goes back to lawvere's "metric spaces, generalized logic and
closed categories" from 1973. the cauchy completeness of a space was
identified with what came to be known as the cauchy completeness of the
corresponding category (see kelly's book on enriched categories, or
francis borceux handbook). and cauchy completeness of a category amounts
to the existence of certain absolute (co)limits: eg over Set, Ab, Cat...
to splitting idempotents (which can be done by taking (co)equalizers with
id).
