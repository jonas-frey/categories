Forgive my repeating, perhaps unnecessarily, the obvious, but
without doing that I fear I may just get inextricably lost as I
try, once again, to sort my way through this question to more of
an answer than I was able to access the last times I tried.

If we pay momentary attention to the "underlying point-set" functor,
from the category of Topological Spaces to that of Sets, we see that
it "has" both a left adjoint, assigning to each set that self-same set
in its discrete topology, and a right adjoint, assigning to each set
that self-same set in its indiscrete topology.

That said, let me turn instead to the "underlying set of objects"
functor from that category of all small categories to that of sets.
It, too, has both a left adjoint, assigning to each set "the" category
having that self-same set as its set of objects, but admitting no =

morphisms between any two objects other than identity maps where =

identity maps are absolutely required -- what's known as the discrete
category on that set of objects -- and a right adjoint, assigning to
each set "the" category having that self-same set as its set of objects,
with the peculiar feature that each of its hom-sets has cardinality 1
-- category that, by analogy with the topological right adjoint, one
might (as Toby Bartels so deftly reminds us) choose to call indiscrete.

And if these categories are nothing more nor less than those that Jean =

B=E9nabou envisages, with functor to the terminal category 1 fully faithf=
ul,
then I guess "indiscrete" would be my answer, too, to his question,
"what would you call" such a category? But for me the indiscreteness
is not in any way a reflection of that full fidelity -- rather, it is
a reflection of the parallel between the fact that such a category "is" =

the value of the right adjoint to the "underlying set of objects" functor=

and that an indiscrete space serves as value of the right adjoint to the =

"underlying point-set" functor.

"Seto=EFd"? "essentially subterminal"? Come on, folks, give us a break :-=
) !

Cheers, -- Fred
