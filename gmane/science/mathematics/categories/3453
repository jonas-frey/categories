                          June 26-28, 2007

                            Paris, France


The 18th International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications
(RTA'07) is organized as part of the Federated Conference on Rewriting,
Deduction, and Programming (RDP'07), which comprises, in addition to RTA'07=
,
the conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA'07) and eight
workshops (HOR, PATE, RULE, SecReT, UNIF, WFLP, WRS, and WST).


IMPORTANT DATES:
 Jan 26, 2007: Deadline for electronic submission of title and abstract
 Jan 31, 2007: Deadline for electronic submission of papers
 Apr 02, 2007: Notification of acceptance of papers
 Apr 23, 2007: Deadline for final versions of accepted papers


RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects of
rewriting. Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

 * Applications: case studies; rule-based (functional and logic) programmin=
g;
   symbolic and algebraic computation; theorem proving; system synthesis an=
d
   verification; analysis of cryptographic protocols; proof checking; reaso=
ning
   about programming languages and logics; program transformation;

 * Foundations: matching and unification; narrowing; completion techniques;
   strategies; constraint solving; explicit substitutions; tree automata;
   termination; combination;

 * Frameworks: string, term, graph, and proof rewriting; lambda-calculus an=
d
   higher-order rewriting; proof nets; constrained rewriting/deduction;
   categorical and infinitary rewriting; integration of decision procedures=
;

 * Implementation: compilation techniques; parallel execution; rewrite tool=
s;
   termination checking;

 * Semantics: equational logic; rewriting logic; rewriting models of progra=
ms.


BEST PAPER AWARD: An award is given to the best paper or papers as decided =
by
the program committee.

RTA'07 SUBMISSIONS:

Submissions must be original and not submitted for publication elsewhere.
Submission categories include regular research papers and system descriptio=
ns.
Problem sets and submissions describing interesting applications of rewriti=
ng
techniques are also welcome. The page limit for submissions is 15 pages in
Springer LNCS style (10 pages for system descriptions). The submission Web
page will be made available beginning of December. As usual, the proceeding=
s
of RTA'07 will be published in the Springer LNCS series.
