Dear colleagues,

It is a pleasure to announce the second edition of the Summer School in 
Algebra and Topology, which will take place in Louvain-la-Neuve from 
Wednesday the 11th until Saturday the 14th of September 2019.

The summer school will consist in four intensive courses addressed to 
Master and PhD students, which will also be of interest to more 
experienced researchers in mathematics. This event is part of a joint 
project of UCLouvain with the universities of Coimbra, Padova and 
Poitiers, promoting research collaboration within the Coimbra Group.

The invited speakers of this the summer school will be professors Silvana 
Bazzoni (Padova), Marino Gran (Louvain-la-Neuve), Sandra Mantovani 
(Milano), and Jorge Picado (Coimbra). The titles of their courses are:

Contramodules and their applications - Silvana Bazzoni
Categories for universal algebra - Marino Gran
Categorical commutator theory - Sandra Mantovani
Frames and locales: topology without points - Jorge Picado

To register, please send a message to Mme Carine Baras 
<carine.baras@uclouvain.be> mentioning your academic status (Master or PhD 
student, post-doc, professor, etc.) and affiliation before the 15th of 
June 2019. She can also help you with booking a room in Louvain-la-Neuve.

There is limited funding to partially cover local expenses for students. 
If you wish to apply for this, then please send me an up-to-date CV and a 
reference letter before the end of March 2019.

Further information is available on the website

With best regards,
Tim
