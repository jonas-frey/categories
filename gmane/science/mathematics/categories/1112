                       UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX
            
            RESEARCH FELLOWS IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING

Two Research Fellows are required for a 2-year project entitled ``The
Semantic Foundations of Mobile Computation'', under the direction of
Prof. M. Hennessy and funded by the EPSRC.

The project objectives include

- the development of abstract foundational calculi for mobile 
systems in which the concepts of location, mobility, failure 
and security play an central role

- the elaboration of behavioural equivalences for these calculi, 
and their associated  algebraic theories

- the construction of proof systems and methodologies for
establishing properties of mobile systems.

The project will start on 1/10/99 and salary will be related to the
academic 1A scale. A Ph.D. in Computer Science or Mathematics or
equivalent experience is required. In addition to normal research
duties the successful candidate will be expected to provide some 
assistance to undergraduate teaching.
