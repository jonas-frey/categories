1) Two days ago by chance I come across an article of Bill Thurston:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236.pdf

and seeing his name mentioned in this thread it occurs to me that
everybody in this list should read it. In my opinion it is an
extraordinary document about mathematics, mathematical activity and
mathematicians.

2) Respect to to subject of this thread, the formal opposite of a
category, denoted "op", is simply a notation very useful to work with
functors which are contravariant in some variables, either with the "op"
in the domain or the codomain of the functor arrow.

Notations are important, and the "op" notation is essential in the
language of categories and functors.

3) Finally, concerning Fred Linton, his death sadness me, he did
important work in the early days of category theory, but more important,
he was one of us, it was always a pleasure to encounter him, an he was a
good guy.

all the best   e.d.
