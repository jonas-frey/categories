Final Call for Papers for CONCUR 2004

[Apologies for multiple postings]

The submission deadline for CONCUR 2004 is fast approaching:

            **** Friday 9 April 2004 ****

New information since previous announcements:

*  David Harel (Weizmann Institute) will give an invited talk entitled
   "A Grand Challenge: Towards Full Reactive Modeling of a Multi-Cellular
   Animal" (see below for other invited speakers)

*  There will be a special issue of the journal Theoretical Computer
   Science associated with CONCUR 2004.

*  There will be a volume of Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer
   Science associated with the workshops.

-------------------------------------------------

CONCUR 2004, the 15th International Conference on Concurrency Theory,
takes place at the Royal Society, London, Tuesday 31 August - Friday 3
September 2004. As well as the main event, we will also hold many
workshops on Monday 30th August and Saturday 4th February, as detailed
below.  Further information is available at the conference's web site

                  http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/concur2004

Important dates
      Submission: Friday 9 April 2004
      Notification: Monday 31 May 2004
      Final version: Tuesday 15 June 2004

The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers and students in order to advance the theory of
concurrency, and promote its applications. Interest in this topic is
continuously growing, as a consequence of the importance and ubiquity
of concurrent systems and their applications, and of the scientific
relevance of their foundations.

Submissions are solicited in all areas of semantics, logics and
verification techniques for concurrent systems. Principal topics
include (but are not limited to): - Basic models and logics of
concurrent and distributed computation (such as process algebras,
Petri nets, domain theoretic or game theoretic models, modal and
temporal logics).  - Specialized or enriched models (such as circuits,
synchronous systems, real time and hybrid systems, stochastic systems,
data bases, mobile and migrating systems, parametric protocols,
security protocols).  - Related verification techniques and tools
(such as state-space exploration, model-checking, synthesis,
abstraction, automated deduction, testing).  - Related programming
models (such as distributed, constraints or object oriented, graph
rewriting, as well as associated type systems, static analyses,
abstract machines, and environments).

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract not exceeding 15
pages electronically via the web submission form at the conference's
web site.  Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee
for inclusion in the proceedings, which will be published by
Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
series. Papers must contain original contributions, be clearly
written, and include appropriate reference to and comparison with
related work.  Simultaneous submissions to other conferences are not
allowed.

There will be a special issue of the journal Theoretical Computer
Science associated with Concur 2004.
