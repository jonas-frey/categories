Hello categorists

=20

To those who have replied on my question and others.

=20

First i want to thank for the suggestions of problems.

=20

Since i am new here some people assume that i seek a problem to solve so =
i can quickly become famous.
I am in fact much more interested in the structure and foundation of math=
ematics than solving
math problems. I just felt i should know these problems since they are fa=
mous, but almost none came to mind.

=20

A reason for this is that the proofs i have seen have mostly been "not wa=
ter tight", they miss some things (mostly in the logic).
And, they are not spelled out in full but are very "cut down" in their ar=
guments. This makes them too time
consuming to follow. I don't want to read a proof to recreate half of it =
but to understand why something is true.

=20

"A mathematical theory is not to be considered complete until you have ma=
de it so clear that you can explain it to the first man whom you meet on =
the street" -David Hilbert

=20

I argue that the same is true for proofs. Something to think about next t=
ime you write a proof.

=20

In Dyson Freemans terminology i am a bird and not a frog. As a bird i mus=
t say that it is sad that about 90% of mathematicians are frogs. This giv=
e an inbalance in mathematics.

=20

To answer Michael Shulman:

Yes, there is something different about category theory. It is at the top=
 of mathematics. A perfect place for a bird :)

=20

Now to my question.

=20

After some intensive work and help from people on the mailing list i have=
 found
some problems that are interesting in ordinary category theory :)

=20

You just have to learn to see them. Some won't be stated even as problems=
 to solve.

=20

To illustrate my point:
How many categories of n objects are there up to categorical equivalence =
for n a natural number?
If it can not be given directly, can it be expressed by other counting fu=
nctions?
Maby the pattern is easier than that for groups.

=20

A simplified version of the problem is to count only finite categories wi=
th at most 1 morphism between any objects.
This suggests the NC(r,s)-problem:
What is the number of categories with r objects and at most s morphisms (=
in one direction) between any two objects.

=20

Specialized versions of these are to count model categories, toposes (def=
ined as categories and not as 2-categories),...
Correct me if it is not so, but i don't know of any theorem that model ca=
tegories or toposes must be infinite.

=20

Another example first stated by John Baez that i call the no-go quantizat=
ion conjecture:
There is no functor from the symplectic category (symplectic manifolds an=
d symplectomorphisms) to the Hilbert category (Hilbert spaces and unitary=
 operators) that preserves positivity. I.e. a one-parameter group of symp=
lectic transformations generated by a positive Hamiltonian is mapped to a=
 one-parameter group of unitary operators with a positive generator.

=20

That maby helps to find the problems. Not that i am trying to popularize =
them.
If you know some you can still e-mail them to me.

=20

Now from the question to the mysterious Hasse Riemann!

=20

It seems that people wonder about me so here i go.

This is written from a 15 year old gymnasium account from the time of the=
 beginning of internet.
Bernhard Riemann was my hero then because of riemannian geometry and riem=
ann surfaces.
Actually i have still not managed to replace Riemann!
Hasse is just a name that i think fits me more than Rafael.
Since everyone i e-mail knows me by this pseudo i have decided not to cha=
nge it.

=20

It took me 20 years of studying mathematics to find category theory.
It is a long time but it was hardly wasted time.
I actually went into category theory 3 times before (not so deep), but no=
t until this fourth time
i understood what category theory really is and that it is precisely what=
 i was looking for :)
,and hence decided to stay here for a long while.


The first year in category theory went with a blazing speed.
Now, a half year after that i have more questions than facts.
I happen to be seated in Stockholm. It is not a bad place but there are n=
o category theorists in Sweden!
Hence i'm counting on you people.

=20

Best regards
