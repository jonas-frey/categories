I visited Bob and his family just before ct2014 and he was strong and
happy, so it is a very sad surprise that he had to go.

Others have already said a few words about his mathematical legacy. I would
like to emphasize his kind and joyous personality. It was a pleasure to
work under his direction with Nicoletta, and it was incredibly entertaining
to share a conversation with them and Aurelio (with whom Bob shared a witty
symbiosis).

   Bob also shared with Aurelio the worries that Marta mentioned in her
email. Some of them are clearly and politely expressed in his blog,
together with many other interesting thoughts and information.

   I will miss him a lot.

   M. Menni.
