There was a similar question "Limits and colimits in Rel?" by  =
UweWolter, on 24 Feb 2014, which had various replies.
I copy my own (with an addition in [[...]]).

----COPY----

As Peter J. is saying, categories of relations have poor (co)limits. [[ =
Eg no equalisers nor coequalisers.]]
For abelian groups, Rel(Ab) does not even have products (sums).

However, if you insert the 2-category Rel  into the double category RRel =
of sets, mappings and relations [GP1]
you have a double category with all double limits and colimits.
For instance: the obvious cartesian product  a x b: XxY --> X' x Y'  =
(resp. sum  a + b: X+Y --> X' + Y')  of two relations a, b
is indeed a product (resp. a sum) in the double category.
See [GP1] for definitions and discussion of these aspects.

Similarly, many bicategories of spans, cospans, relations, =
profunctors... have poor (co)limits, but can be usefully embedded in
weak double categories (with the same objects, "strict morphisms", "same =
morphisms", suitable double cells) that have all limits
and colimits.

Also adjoints work well in the extended settings: see [GP2].

Best regards

Marco
