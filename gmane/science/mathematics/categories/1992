Paul raised an interesting question.  However, my experience with both
kinds of journals leads me to believe that the commercial publishers keep
hands off the day-to-day issues of the sort he raises.  I could imagine an
extreme case in which the publisher might step in, but I have never seen
it happen.  There is invariably an academic editor-in-chief (who, in the
case of a commercial journal, gets paid an amount which was once described
to me as "substantial", with no details) and I have never heard of an
author going beyond that level, although they could try.

I would like to take exception to Paul's "NOTHING AT ALL" comment. As far
as I can tell, the value added by commercial publishers is actually
NEGATIVE, since by owning the copyright they attempt to keep the papers
out of general circulation.  An Elsevier flack writing to respond to my
posting two years ago tried to justify price increases in the face of
falling costs by raising the issue of paper costs.  Now I buy a sheet of
letter-size paper for about 1 cent (and the shriveled Canadian cent at
that).  I don't know what Elsevier pays, but I would be surprised if they
pay half of that.  But maybe the common market supports the price of
paper, so take that 1 c as given.  JPAA costs about $4000 for 2000 pages
(that's Canadian $).  So it costs $2 per page.  Now tell me how a rise in
the cost of paper can be a significant cause in the doubling of the
subscription price over the decade?  The flack made other, equally
spurious claims.  

In the past five years all my papers have been published in TAC, in
Cahiers, and I now have one submitted to the electronic HHA (Homology,
Homotopy and Applications).
