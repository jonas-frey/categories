I learnt to call that an "indiscrete category", so I probably would.
(Another term that I've heard is "chaotic category", which I never liked.)
Of course, I could also call it a "truth value",
but only in a context where I would expect this to be understood
(and being "non-evil", that is working up to equivalence,
is not actually sufficient for that).  Thus the nLab has
http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/indiscrete+category as its own page.

It is beautiful, but is it accurate?

On the contrary, an ff and eso functor between two categories
is enough for the people who abhor evil, as far as I know,
to decide that the categories are equivalent (and so essentially the same).
Yet at the same time, these people tend to abhor AC!  How can this be?
It works if one works in a 2-category whose 1-morphisms are anafunctors.
Then it is a theorem requiring no choice (and true internal to any topos)
that any ff and eso functor can be enriched to an adjoint equivalence
(and in an essentially unique way).

Of course, "abhor" here should really be read as "consider optional".
It is possible to work with strict categories, or to work with AC,
but the main principles and results of category theory do not require either.
