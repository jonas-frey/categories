SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

                              CiE 2008
                   http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/cie08/

   Computability in Europe 2008: Logic and Theory of Algorithms

                        University of Athens
                       Athens, June 15-20 2008


PAPER SUBMISSION is now OPEN:
            http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/cie08/submission.php


This is the fourth in a series of conferences organised by CiE
(Computability in Europe), a European network of mathematicians,
logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and
others interested in new developments in computability and their
underlying significance for the real world. Previous meetings took
place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006) and Siena (2007).

CiE 2008 aims at bridging the gap from the logical methods of
mathematical and meta-mathematical flavour to the applied and
industrial questions that are involved in devising and choosing
the right algorithms and analysing their effectiveness and efficiency.

We cordially invite all researchers (European and non-European)
in computability related areas to submit their papers (in PDF-
format, max 10 pages) for presentation at CiE 2008. We particularly
invite papers that build bridges between different parts of
the research community.

The CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS will be published by LNCS, Springer-Verlag.
There will also be journal special issues, collecting invited
contributions related to the conference.  So far we have secured
special issues in the journals "Theory of Computing Systems" and
"Archive for Mathematical Logic".
