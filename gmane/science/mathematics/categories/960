Since I asked the question I've found a few examples; they've all got
the same flavour about them, so I'll just do my favourite.

If V is the commutative monoid, then a V-enriched category is a set A plus
two functions
	[-,-,-]: A x A x A ---> V
	    [-]:         A ---> V
satisfying
	[a,c,d] + [a,b,c] = [a,b,d] + [b,c,d]
	  [a,a,b] + [a] = 0 = [a,b,b] + [b]
for all a, b, c, d. 

The example: let A be a subset of the plane. Choose a smooth path P(a,b) from
a to b for each (a,b) in A x A, and define [a,b,c] to be the signed area
bounded by the loop
	P(a,b) then P(b,c) then (P(a,c) run backwards);
also define [a] to be 
	-(area bounded by P(a,a)). 
(There's meant to be an orientation on the plane, so that areas can be
negative.)  Then the equations say obvious things about area - don't think
I'm up to that kind of ASCII art, though.
