                            CALCO 2007

    2nd Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science
                          CALCO Tools Day

              August 20-24, 2007, Bergen, Norway

July 1          Rgular registration deadline
                 Hotel booking deadline

After this date late registration prices take effect,
and it may become very difficult to find hotel rooms.

August 20       CALCO-jnr, CALCO-tools
August 21-24    CALCO technical programme


CALCO'07 takes place at Grand Hotel Terminus in Bergen, one of many
historic hotels in Norway. The conference starts Monday with two workshops
followed by an official reception Monday evening.  The main program runs
Tuesday through Friday, each morning starting with an invited speaker.
Additional events are excursion by boat in the Bergen archipelago
(Wednesday afternoon) and conference dinner on one of the mountains
surrounding the city centre (Thursday afternoon).


Registration
------------
Registration fee is 3200 NOK (1200 NOK for students), with a noticeable
increase for late registration after July 1. The=20
fee includes the full conference
with all workshops, a copy of the proceedings, lunches and coffee breaks,
and the official reception Monday evening.

Registration is via the calco07 web site:
    http://www.ii.uib.no/calco07/

Note that Bergen is very busy during the tourist season, so early booking
of accommodation and transportation is strongly recommended.



Main CALCO'07 conference
------------------------
CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference. It brings together
researchers and practitioners to exchange new results related
to foundational aspects and both traditional and emerging uses of
algebras and coalgebras in computer science. The study of algebra
and coalgebra relates to the data, process and structural aspects of
software systems. The accepted papers report results of theoretical work
on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the way these results
can support methods and techniques for software development, as well as
experience with the transition of resulting technologies into industrial
practise. Some main key words are:

     * Abstract models and logics
     * Specialised models and calculi
     * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
     * System specification and verification

The list of accepted papers is available at the web site.

CALCO is Tuesday-Friday, 0900-1700, but ends at 1400 Friday.


Invited speakers
----------------
Stephen L. Bloom, Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ, USA

Luis Caires, New University of Lisbon, Portugal

Barbara K=F6nig, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany

Glynn Winskel, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom


CALCO-jnr (CALCO Young Researchers Workshop)
--------------------------------------------
CALCO-jnr is dedicated to presentations by PhD students and by those who
completed their doctoral studies within the past few years. This year
12 contributions within the theme of CALCO have been accepted. See the
overview on the CALCO-jnr web page on the CALCO web site.

CALCO-jnr is Monday 0900-1730.


CALCO-tools
-----------
CALCO-tools is dedicated to presentation and demonstration of
tools based on algebraic and coalgebraic principles. These include
systems/prototypes/tools developed specifically for design, checking,
execution, and verification of (co)algebraic specifications, but
also tools targeting different application domains but making core or
interesting use of (co)algebraic techniques. A Maude tool environment
and a coinductive prover will be showcased this year.

CALCO-tools is Monday 1530-1700.
