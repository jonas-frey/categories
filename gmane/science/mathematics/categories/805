	1st CALL FOR PAPERS -- CSL'99

	Annual Conference of the European Association
	             for Computer Science Logic

	September 20-24, 1999, Madrid, Spain
	===================================


CSL is the annual conference of the European Association for Computer
Science Logic (EACSL). The conference is intended for computer scientists
whose research activities involve logic, as well as for logicians working
on issues significant for computer science. Suggested, but not exclusive,
topics of interest include:

* abstract datatypes,
* automated deduction,
* categorical and topological approaches,
* concurrency theory,
* constructive mathematics,
* database theory,
* domain theory,
* finite model theory,
* lambda and combinatory calculi,
* logical aspects of computational complexity,
* logical foundations of programming paradigms,
* linear logic,
* modal and temporal logics,
* model checking,
* program logics and semantics,
* program specification, transformation and verification,
* rewriting,
* symbolic computation.

Submissions must arrive by  April 2, 1999, and notifications of acceptance
will be sent by July 5, 1999. Authors are invited to send manuscripts by
electronic mail, as uuencoded gzipped postcript files:

* see the conference home page for instructions
	http://mozart.sip.ucm.es:1580/csl99 (forthcoming)
* or send an empty message with subject "submission information'' to
	csl99org@eucmos.sim.ucm.es

Those authors without access to the facilities for electronic submission
can alternatively submit five hardcopies to:

	Prof. Mario Rodriguez Artalejo, CSL'99
	Departamento de  Sistemas Informaticos y Programacion
	Facultad de Matematicas, Universidad Complutense de Madrid

PUBLICATION
According to the current EACSL policy, authors of accepted papers must
present them at the conference and simultaneously submit a revised full
version to be considered in a second refereeing process. Papers accepted in
this second round will appear in a proceedings volume published by Springer
in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series, after the conference.
This policy might be changed after the EACSL membership assembly at CSL'98
(Brno, Czech Republic, August 23-28, 1998). New information will be given
in the 2nd call for papers, to be sent out in coming september.
