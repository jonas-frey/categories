SCORE committee members. Teams will produce a report as their first
deliverable, followed by a prototype system for those chosen as
semi-finalists. Evaluation will be based on the quality of the software
engineering process followed, as well as the outcome.

In order to accommodate all academic calendars, the 2009 SCORE Contest
will run from December 2007 to January 2009 with with team sign-up
starting in February 2008 and ending in November 2008. Up to 10 finalist
