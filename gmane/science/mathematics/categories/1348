I am deeply embarrassed at not drawing this inference myself.  I noticed
the felicitous identification of 0111... and 1000... but the importance of
the resulting redundancy didn't click.  That the whole process happened
in one step led me to think that the representation was as irredundant
as all extant one-step constructions.  The fact that addition is easier
to define with Peter's functor than with ours should have been a big hint.

Redundant representations for fast computer arithmetic have been in wide
use since the 1960's.  The Wallace tree, long available in chip form,
leverages the idea to multiply n bit integers with log n circuit delay.
(Chris Wallace is an Australian computer scientist who came up with
this idea while working on Illiac 2 at the University of Illinois.)
The actual multiplication takes half the time, the other half is spent
performing the identification step at the end, namely by putting the
result into canonical form.

All redundant representations of the reals that are or could be used
in computer architecture require a separate step to identify the
redundant representations.  For example Schanuel's recently discussed
almost-additive sequences of integers redundantly represent the reals,
and must be quotiented in order to represent them irredundantly.  By the
same token the group of bounded sequences that I mentioned does the
same, and it too must be quotiented in a separate step, in this case by
a subgroup expressing 2(x/2) = x.

Peter's final coalgebra performs the identification in the same step in
which the reals are created.  I am fairly confident there is no precedent
for such a one-step construction of the reals in which the representation
is redundant.
