Peter Easthope  points out that in
 Lawvere & Schanuel there is no
mention of Arend Heyting. That is
unfortunate, especially since=20
pp 348-352 are devoted to
introducing Heyting's Algebras=20
and one of their possible
objective origins. The 2nd edition
should correct this omission.

Summarizing the 16 responses,
a common thought of many must=20
have been=20
"If small implies finite
then any example must be a poset
(category in which any two parallel
maps are equal) because of Freyd's
 theorem.  A CC poset is almost=20
by definition a Heying Algebra.
There are linearly ordered ones of=20
any size, but if the size is four or more,
there are also examples that are not=20
linearly ordered....
=20
On the other hand if infinite examples=20
are allowed, and posetal ones are not,
it is hard to think of a  CCC smaller than
a skeletal category of all finite sets."
