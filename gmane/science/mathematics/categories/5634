DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP

It has been understood since the late 1960s that tools and
structures arising in mathematical logic and proof theory
can usefully be applied to the design of high level programming
languages, and to the development of reasoning principles for
such languages. Yet low level languages, such as machine code,
and the compilation of high level languages into a low level ones
have traditionally been seen as having little or no essential
connection to logic.

However, a fundamental discovery of this past decade has been
that low level languages are also governed by logical principles.
From=20this key observation has emerged an active and fascinating
new research area at the frontier of logic and computer science.
The practically-motivated design of logics reflecting the structure
of low level languages (such as heaps, registers and code pointers)
and low level properties of programs (such as resource usage)
goes hand in hand with the some of the most advanced contemporary
researches in semantics and proof theory, including classical
realizability and forcing, double orthogonality, parametricity,
linear logic, game semantics, uniformity, categorical semantics,
explicit substitutions, abstract machines, implicit complexity
and sublinear programming.

The LOLA workshop, affiliated with LICS, will bring together
researchers interested in the various aspects of the relationship
between logic and low level languages and programs.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

       - Typed assembly languages
       - Certified compilation
       - Proof-carrying code
       - Program optimization
       - Modal logic and realizability in machine code
       - Realizability and double orthogonality in assembly code,
       - Implicit complexity, sublinear programming and Turing machines
       - Parametricity, modules and existential types
       - General references, Kripke models and recursive types
       - Closures and explicit substitutions
       - Linear logic and separation logic
       - Game semantics, abstract machines and hardware synthesis
       - Monoidal and premonoidal categories, traces and effects

PROGRAMME COMMITTEE

       * Amal Ahmed (Indiana University)
       * Nick Benton (MSR Cambridge, co-chair)
       * Lars Birkedal (IT University of Copenhagen)
       * Dan Ghica (University of Birmingham)
       * Paul-Andre Mellies (CNRS & University Paris Diderot, co-chair)
       * Fran=E7ois Pottier (INRIA Rocquencourt)
       * Ulrich Schoepp (LMU Munich)
       * Hayo Thielecke (University of Birmingham)

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

LOLA is an informal workshop aiming at a high degree of
useful interaction  amongst the participants, welcoming
proposals for talks on work in progress, overviews of larger
programmes, position presentations and short tutorials as well
as more traditional research talks describing new results.

The programme committee will select the workshop presentations
from submitted proposals, which may take the form either of
a short abstract or of a longer (published or unpublished) paper
describing completed work.

The submissions should be made by easychair at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlola2010

INVITED SPEAKERS

To be announced soon.
