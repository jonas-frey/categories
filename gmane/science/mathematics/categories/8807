           ANNOUNCEMENT: AARMS Summer School at Dalhousie University

                                               July 11 - August 5, 2016


The AARMS Summer School 2016 will offer courses in category theory and numb=
er
theory and combinatorics.

  Directors: Dr. Dorette Pronk, Dalhousie University and Dr. Geoffrey Cruttw=
ell, Mount Allison University

  The AARMS summer school is intended for graduate students and promising
  undergraduate students from all parts of the world. Each participant is
  required to register for two of the four courses in order to receive suppo=
rt=20
  from AARMS. Each course consists of five ninety-minute lecture sessions ea=
ch=20
  week. These are graduate courses approved by Dalhousie and we will facilit=
ate=20
  transfer credit to the extent possible.

  The courses of interest to people on this list are the following.

  Higher Category Theory and Categorical Logic
  Instructors: Dr. Michael Shulman, University of San Diego, and=20
                        Dr. Peter Lumsdaine, Stockholm University

  Description: This course will introduce students to the relationship betwe=
en
  category theory and logic, and its emerging generalization to higher categ=
ory
  theory. On the one hand, category theory provides a flexible and powerful
  semantics for logic, uniting for instance forcing models of set theory wit=
h
  domain semantics for programming languages. On the other hand, logic
  provides an "internal language" for categories, that can greatly simplify =
the
  proofs of general theorems. We will discuss the classical version of this
  correspondence that applies to ordinary categories, including elementary
  toposes. Then we will introduce some basic concepts of higher category
  theory, and end with a brief introduction to homotopy type theory, a logic
  that corresponds to certain higher categories.


  Categories, Quantum Computation and Topology
  Instructor: Dr. Jamie Vicary, University of Oxford

  Description: This course will introduce the theory of monoidal categories,=
  an
  approach to mathematics which combines algebra and geometry into a single
  subject, and investigates its applications in quantum computation and
  topology. An emphasis will be on graphical calculi, which allow us to prov=
e
  theorems using pictures, rather than traditional mathematical syntax. The
  course will also have a practical component, using the proof assistant
  Globular to formalize and investigate the results we encounter. Topics
  studied will include coherence, linear structures, duality, monoids and
  comonoids, Frobenius and Hopf algebras, quantum groups, quantum
  protocols, higher categories, and topological quantum field theory.

  There will also be a week with preparatory lectures on basic category theo=
ry by Geoff Cruttwell, from
  July 4 till July 8.

  For more information and the application form, visit the summer school web=
site,

  https://aarms.math.ca/the-2016-aarms-summer-school/

  Don't wait too long with applying as we can only support 20 students in
  category theory.

  Since CT2016 will be held in Halifax right after this summer school, inter=
ested students may want to get=20
  a dorm room at Dalhousie that they can keep for the whole time. There is o=
ne residence house=20
  (with kitchen facilities) that we would like to use for this, but we can o=
nly reserve it if there is enough interest.=20
  So if you are interested in this option contact us as soon as possible to =
show your interest and indicate the dates=20
  for your time in Halifax.
