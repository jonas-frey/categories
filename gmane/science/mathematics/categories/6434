Consider the powerset space P(A x A) = 2^(A x A).  The product topology
makes it a Stone space.  This is elementary.

Now, the space X of congruences is defined by logical formulae with
only universal quantifiers and atomic formulae xEy for variables
ranging over A.  That makes X a CLOSED subspace of P(A x A).

This is so easy, it hardly needs a name.  And it works even if A has
infinitely many operations.  That there is an equational theory in the
background seems neither here nor there to get a Stone space of congruences.

HAPPY NEW YEAR!
