I had heard from Manchester people that Harold was very ill, but the news of=
  his death was still unexpected.

I knew Harold from the many valuable conversations that I had with him when I=
  was writing "Topology via Logic". He was always encouraging and helped me w=
ith quite a few technical issues of locale theory.

I say "locale theory", but it's perhaps more accurate to describe his partic=
ular approach as that of a frame theorist. I remember him as someone enthusi=
astic for the intrinsic algebraic interest of frames, a part of which was ab=
out using the lattice theory to get a better understanding of point-set topo=
logy, and with no patience for the dual language of locales - that would be o=
bfuscation, failure to call a spade a spade.
