-- SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS --

ETAPS conferences accept two types of contributions: research papers
and tool demonstration papers. Both types will appear in the
proceedings and have presentations during the conference.=20

ESOP and FoSSaCS accept only research papers. FASE, POST and TACAS
have multiple types of research papers, see below.

A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one
of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation.

Submitted papers must be in English presenting original research. They
must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere (this
does not apply to abstracts). In particular, simultaneous submission
of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is
forbidden.=20

Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer's
Lecture Notes in Computer Science and be submitted electronically in
pdf through the EasyChair author interface of the respective
conference.

Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be
rejected immediately.

FASE and POST will use a double-blind review process.

The proceedings of ETAPS 2018 will be published in *gold open
access*. The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors. The
proceedings will be published in the Advanced Research in Computing
and Software Science (ARCoSS) subline of Springer's Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series.

NB! The publisher's charges for gold open access will be paid by the
conference (funded with the participation fees of all
participants). There will be no added cost for authors
specifically. The overall rise in participation fee levels will be
small.


- Research papers

FASE, FoSSaCS and TACAS have a page limit of 15 pp (excluding
bibliography of max 2 pp) for research papers, whereas POST allows at
most 20 pp (excluding bibliography of max 2 pp) and ESOP 25 pp
(excluding bibliography of max 2 pp).

Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication
in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed
in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page
limit. ETAPS referees are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers
must be understandable without them.

In addition to regular research papers, TACAS solicits also *case
study papers* (with the same page limit as for regular resarch
papers). POST solicits also *systematization of knowledge papers*
(with the same page limit as for regular research papers) and
*position papers* (max 10 pp, excl bibliography of max 2 pp).

Both TACAS and FASE solicit also *regular tool papers* (at most 15 pp,
excluding bibliography of max 2 pp).


- Tool demonstration papers

Submissions should consist of two parts:

* The first part, at most 6 pages, should describe the tool
    presented. Please include the URL of the tool (if available) and
    provide information that illustrates the maturity and robustness of
    the tool. (This part will be included in the proceedings.)

* The second part, at most 6 pages, should explain how the
    demonstration will be carried out and what it will show, including
    screen dumps and examples. (This part will be not be included in the
    proceedings, but will be evaluated.

ESOP and FoSSaCS do not accept tool demonstration papers.


-- SATELLITE EVENTS (14-15 April, 21 April) --

A number of satellite workshops will take place before and after the
main conferences: CMCS, CREST, DICE, FoMLAS, GALOP, HotSpot,
LiVe, MARS, MeTRiD, SNR, SynCoP, VerifyThis, VPT, VSSE, WRLA.


-- HOST INSTITUTION --

ETAPS 2018 is hosted by the School of Informatics of the Aristotle
University of Thessaloniki, the largest university in Greece.
