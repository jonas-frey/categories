> So, to return to John Baez's interview, how might we look for category =
theory helping to understand the world's problems? We must first look =
for objects  and morphisms, with identities and associative composition, =
so what are the  real-world prototypes of what we are trying to do =
there? What is the first step beyond the vague aspirations?

Wrt real-world prototypes of morphism, John Baez in his recent SYCO 4 =
talk [1] suggested that the idea of a morphism as a component of a =
network (and composition as "wiring up'' components) could have =
applications in many areas outside of computer science, including =
engineering, biology and ecology.

This is still vague, so I am not pretending to answer Steve's question, =
but I think it points in a direction that is promising.

All the best,

Alexander
