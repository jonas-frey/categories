ANNOUNCEMENT:
The Quantum and Computational Linguistics groups of the Oxford
University Computing Laboratory will host a three-day workshop on the
interplay between algebra and coalgebra that can be thought of as
information flow, and its applications to quantum physics and linguistics=
.

TOPIC:
The aim of the workshop is to bring people together from the fields of
quantum groups, categorical quantum mechanics, logic, and linguistics,
to exchange talks and ideas of a (co)algebraic nature, about the
interaction between algebras (monoids) and coalgebras (comonoids) that
can be thought of as "information flow". Many such structure have been
found useful across these fields, such as Frobenius algebras and
bialgebras such as Hopf algebras. They have also showed up in
grammatical and vector space models of natural language to for example
encode meaning of verbs and logical connectives.

PROGRAMME:
The precise schedule is not yet fixed, but speakers include:
   * Samson Abramsky (Oxford)
   * Daoud Clark (Hertfordshire)
   * Stephen Clark (Cambridge)
   * Bob Coecke (Oxford)
   * Lucas Dixon (Edinburgh)
   * Bertfried Fauser (Birmingham)
   * Mai Gehrke (Nijmegen)
   * Helle Hansen (Eindhoven)
   * Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen)
   * Shahn Majid (London)
   * Michael Moortgat (Utrecht)
   * Michael M=FCger (Nijmegen)
   * Peter Hines (York)
   * Alessandra Palmigiano (Amsterdam)
   * Benjamin Piwowarski (Glasgow)
   * Anne Preller (Montpellier)
   * Stephen Pulman (Oxford)
   * Keith van Rijsbergen (Glasgow)

REGISTRATION:
Registration is free, but for logistic purposes, please inform the
organizers
   Chris Heunen <chris.heunen@comlab.ox.ac.uk> and/or
