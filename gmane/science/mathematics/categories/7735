There is no problem, either in practice or in formal ETCS or CCAF
foundations, with assuming there is only one countably infinite set, call
it N.  Then indeed every function N-->N has graph N>-->NxN for some monic
N>-->NxN.  But there are uncountably many different monics N>-->NxN so it
does not follow that all functions N-->N are equal.  Different monics to
NxN can have identical domains.

Of course is also follows that NxN=N.  But it does not follow, and in fact
it is refutable, that the projection functions are the identity function
1_N.

Isbell's argument is on p. 164 of my copy of CfWM (1998).  On the plainest
reading, it shows you could assume Xx(YxZ)=(XxY)xZ as sets, for all sets
nX,Y,Z, but even then it is contradictory to suppose the associativity
function  Xx(YxZ) --> (XxY)xZ is always the identity function.

This shows we cannot simultaneously maintain:

1)  There is a category Set^2 with the usual properties of a functor
category.
2)  Isomorphic objects are equal in all categories.

Mac~Lane concludes we cannot accept the sweeping skeletal principle 2.

I will say some higher category theorists promote another option.  They
would keep 2, by rejecting 1, by saying there are not functor categories in
the standard (1-categorical) sense, but only some infinity-categorical
analogue.  I do not know if that has ever been systematically spelled out
though of course there are projects like Makkai's advocacy of FOLDS that
are meant to go that way.
