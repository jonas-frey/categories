Dear Richard,

If we were asking the same question about the category SimplSet of
simplicial sets instead of Cat, the answer would be obvious since:

(*) The functor Set ---> Set sending X to X^n preserves reflexive
coequalizers for each natural n. This (very simple) fact should be
considered as well known since it is involved in one of several well-known
proofs of monadicity of varieties of universal algebras over Set.

(**) Since SimplSet is a Set-valued functor category, all colimits in it
reduce to colimits in Set.

For those who are familiar with the standard adjunction between SimplSet and
Cat, the result for SimplSet will immediately imply the result for Cat
(since the fundamental category functor being the left adjoint in that
adjunction preserves all colimits and obviously sends "indiscrete simplicial
sets" to indiscrete categories).

One could also use various (not too much) truncated simplicial sets instead
of the simplicial sets of course (e.g. what I once called "precategories").

I mean, I do not remember any reference, but I would not need the explicit
description of colimits in Cat.

George Janelidze
