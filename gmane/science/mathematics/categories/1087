I wonder whether the notion of "h4-category" which I introduced for
abstract homotopy theory (see the references in my first reply) might be of
use for this.

It is a sort of "2-category vertically relaxed up to a 'shadow' of 3-cells"
(whereas bi-categories are horizontally relaxed up to invertible 2-cells).

To begin with, it is a category enriched over reflexive graphs in the sense
previously described: there is a reduced horizontal composition, of maps
with cells and cells with maps, which is strictly associative as far as
this makes sense.
There also are vertical identities, vertical involution and vertical
composition, which only satisfy the usual axioms up to an assigned
equivalence relation ("2-homotopy").
This approach is truncated at the level of usual (first-order) homotopies;
3-cells (homotopies of homotopies) only leave their 'shadow', as an
equivalence relation.

If you want to proceed further, my impression is that the relaxed
categorical machinery becomes too heavy (at least for my taste). However,
if your 2-cells (homotopies) can be represented

- by a cylinder functor  I,  as arrows  IX -> Y,
- or dually by a path functor  P,  as arrows  X -> PY,
     (or by both, forming an adjoint pair  I -| P)

as it happens for most "concrete" homotopy theories, then the powers of
such endofunctor and the clone of operations (natural transformations)
linking them, derived from the basic ones (faces, degeneracy,
concatenation, etc.), seem to give all what we need in any dimension.
This machinery of derived operations can be seen in a paper of mine

Categorically algebraic foundations for homotopical algebra, Appl. Categ.
Structures 5 (1997), 363-413,

but of course "abstract cylinder functors" go back, at least, to Kan; other
references can be found in the paper above.
