Is there a standard accepted name for categories all whose morphisms =20
are both epi and mono? This includes groupoids, posets and preorders, =20=

along with free categories (from graphs), so it's not a trivial class =20=

at all.

I am leaning towards calling them "integral categories", by analogy =20
with integral domains, but Google searches have been frustrating. =20
Another possiblility would be "cancellation categories" (they have =20
both the left and right cancellation property), but I'm not sure I =20
like this one.

Is there anything about these in the literature already?

Thanks in advance,

Fran=E7ois
