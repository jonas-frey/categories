Dear colleagues,

It is a pleasure to announce the second edition of the Summer School in Alg=
ebra and Topology, which will take place in Louvain-la-Neuve from Wednesday=
  the 11th until Saturday the 14th of September 2019.

The summer school will consist in four intensive courses addressed to Maste=
r and PhD students, which will also be of interest to more experienced rese=
archers in mathematics. This event is part of a joint project of UCLouvain =
with the universities of Coimbra, Padova and Poitiers, promoting research c=
ollaboration within the Coimbra Group.=20

The invited speakers of this the summer school will be professors Silvana B=
azzoni (Padova), Marino Gran (Louvain-la-Neuve), Sandra Mantovani (Milano),=
  and Jorge Picado (Coimbra). The titles of their courses are:

Contramodules and their applications - Silvana Bazzoni
Categories for universal algebra - Marino Gran
Categorical commutator theory - Sandra Mantovani
Frames and locales: topology without points - Jorge Picado

To register, please send a message to Mme Carine Baras <carine.baras@uclouv=
ain.be> mentioning your academic status (Master or PhD student, post-doc, p=
rofessor, etc.) and affiliation before the 15th of June 2019. If you wish, =
she can also help you with booking one of the rooms we reserved at the stud=
ent residence "Le Relais" and at the hotel "Ibis Style"; in that case, plea=
se contact her as soon as possible.

There is limited funding to partially cover local expenses for students. If=
  you wish to apply for this, then please send me an up-to-date CV and a ref=
erence letter before the end of March 2019.

Further information is available on the website https://uclouvain.be/en/res=
earch-institutes/irmp/summer-school-in-algebra-and-topology-2019.html

With best regards,=20
Tim
