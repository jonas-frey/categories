As I mentioned in a subsequent message, this is actually not
the only place where I had to use monotonicity.

Now I realized that monotonicity cannot be deduced from f(fp -> p)
without additional assumptions.

Consider fp = (p or not p); then f(fp -> p) = (not p or not not p),
so that f(fp -> p) holds iff the topos is de Morgan, whereas
f is monotone iff the topos is Boolean (since f0 = 1).
