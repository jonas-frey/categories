This is a very sophisticated problem, involving rewrite theory. 

Without the compositions, and with only one connection, there is work in 
86. (with A.P.TONKS), ``Calculations with simplicial and cubical groups 
in AXIOM'', {\em J. Symbolic Computation}, 17 (1994) 159-179. 

But AXIOM is not the easiest to get working for you! I have not looked at 
this for a long time. 

The difficulties of using the interchange rule are quickly seen by 
considering pre crossed and crossed modules. We actually did some 
calculations of induced crossed modules in 

92. (with C.D.WENSLEY), ``On finite induced crossed modules and the 
homotopy 2-type of mapping cones'', {\em Theory
and Applications of Categories} 1(3) (1995) 54-71. 
95. (with C.D.WENSLEY), ``Computing crossed modules induced by an 
inclusion of a normal subgroup, with applications to
homotopy 2-types'', {\em Theory and Applications of Categories} 2 (1996) 
3-16. 

There is more on rewriting in Heyworth-Wensley

I thoroughly appreciate the need!
