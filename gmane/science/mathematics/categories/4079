Dear Jean,

Here is what seems to be my 14th letter to you in this connection. It is a
friendly reminder that I did not "support" Peter Johnstone. Here is an
extract at the end of my November 4 official intervention ("Response to
Benabou") in categories.

>(page 303), the references given in El 1 are Bourn, Bunge and Pare, Giraud,

>Benabou-Roubaud. I am sure that Peter will repair this error should a

In fact, I do not think that Peter Johnstone "supports" himself in this
matter -- he has admitted the error. What more do you want him to say?


However, in view of the evidence, provided by Street and Lawvere, of the
possibility that Jon Beck may have discovered this theorem independently and
even talked about it, as the abstract in the Notices of the AMS (1967) seems
to indicate, it seems fair after all to add his name to yours in connection
with it. It is common pratice in mathematics to give credit for ideas
disseminated at lectures, even more so if these ideas are mentioned in an
abstract. This does not take away your own credit.

This is my very last letter on the subject, private or official.

With best wishes,
Marta
