 	 8th workshop on QUANTUM PHYSICS AND LOGIC (QPL 2011)

 		    Nijmegen, October 27-29, 2011.
 		      http://qpl.science.ru.nl/

 			Call for participation

 				  *

  This event will bring together researchers working on mathematical
  foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing and information,
  and spatio-temporal causal structures, and in particular those that
  use logical tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic
  structures, formal languages, semantical methods and other computer
  science methods for the study physical behaviour in general. Over the
  past few years, there has been growing activity in these foundational
  approaches, together with a renewed interest in the foundations of
  quantum theory, which complement the more mainstream research in
  quantum computation.

REGISTRATION AND LOCAL INFORMATION:

  Please register for the workshop by October 3, 9:00 CET. The
  organizers need the number of participants in order to make proper
  arrangements. Information on registration, travel, and accommodations
  can be found on the workshop website at http://qpl.science.ru.nl/.

STUDENT SUPPORT:

  We encourage participation by graduate students at the workshop.
  Students will pay a reduced registration fee. We will also be able to
  provide limited financial support to students for travel and
  accommodations; if you are interested in this, please email
  i.haerkens@cs.ru.nl by October 3rd, 9:00 CET.

  Please also arrange for a brief letter of recommendation from your
  supervisor, to be sent to the same email address before the deadline.
  Your supervisor's letter should also state whether you have access
  to funding from other sources, and how much.
