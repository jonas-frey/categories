Bill Lawvere has drawn my attention to a significant
moment in the history of the application of the ideas
of algebraic theories to computer science of which
I was quite unaware. In 1967 Eilenberg gave the four
Colloquium Lectures at the Summer Meeting of the AMS
in Toronto. Available details are as follows.

August 29-September 1, 1967, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Samuel Eilenberg, Columbia University.
Universal algebras and the theory of automata.

Contrary to what one might suppose this material
did not appear in any of the books or papers of
Eilenberg or his collaborators; but lecture notes
were distributed at the meeting. Does anyone have
a copy which they could make available?

The notes would be of great interest right now
from a historical point of view for a paper
by John Power and me. But it seems likely that
formulations in the notes would be of wider interest
as by the time (at least) of the notes it seems that
Eilenberg had digested the material in Lawvere's thesis.

In hope,
Martin Hyland
