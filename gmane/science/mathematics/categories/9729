A time ago when I was working on the subject I was also very curious
about the same (or related) questions of Johon Baez.
More concretely, if you take a pointless connected atomic topos (we know
they are):

How or which is the localic point that Joyal-Tierney using change of
base take out of the hat ?

How or which is the localic groupoid of Joyal-Tierney ?
