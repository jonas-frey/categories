Dear categorists,

I have a question which is probably obvious except for me... Take a limit
theory T. Add a basic sentence to this theory to obtain a theory T'. So
Mod(T') is accessible, Mod(T) is locally presentable. Is Mod(T') accessibly-
embedded, i.e. does Mod(T')\subset Mod(T) preserve filtered colimits for a big
enough regular cardinal ? Or in other terms, what is going on when a basic
axiom is added. I cannot find any answer in Adamek&Rosicky's book. Of course I
ask you the question because this is my situation. In my situation T and T'
are purely relational and the signature contains the same four relation
symbols. The only difference between T and T' is an additional axiom which is a
basic sentence.

thanks in advance. pg.
