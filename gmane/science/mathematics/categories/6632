Speaking as a novice: yes, certainly.  Isn't it a question of degree?  So=
me=20
proofs explain beautifully while others are clear as mud; most are =20
between.  Ideally a proof shouldn't depend upon natural language but=20
most do.  Striking sometimes how changing a few words of a sentence=20
can make a concept obvious rather than nebulous.

For example, I've proven some of the power laws for map objects.  There=20
should be a way to reduce the definition of a map object and the power=20
laws to analogues in arithmetic.  Still eludes me.  My proofs have yet to=
=20
help.  So my understanding is incomplete and my power law proofs are=20
poor.

Best regards,                      ... Peter E.
