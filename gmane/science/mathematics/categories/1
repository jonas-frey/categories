1) Conference

Over the past fifteen years, the RelMiCS meetings have been a main forum for
researchers who use the calculus of relations and similar algebraic =20
formalisms as
methodological and conceptual tools. The workshop series on Applications of
Kleene algebra started with a Dagstuhl seminar in 2001 and has been co-
organised with the RelMiCS conference since. Due to their considerable =20
overlap,
the two events have a joint PC and joint proceedings.Their scope comprises
relation algebra, fixpoint calculi, semiring theory, iteration =20
algebras, process
algebras and dynamic algebras. Applications include formal algebraic =20
modelling,
the semantics, analysis and development of programs, formal language theory
and combinatorial optimisation.

We invite submissions on the general topics of Relation Algebra
and Kleene Algebra in computer science. Special focus will lie
on formal methods for software engineering, logics of programs and
links with neighbouring disciplines. Particular topics of the =20
conference cover, but
are not limited to the theory of

- relation algebras and Kleene algebras
- related formalisms such as process algebras, fixed point calculi, idempote=
nt
   semirings, quantales, allegories, dynamic algebras, cylindric =20
algebras and their
   applications in areas such as
   - verification, analysis and development of programs and algorithms
   - relational formal methods such as B or Z, tabular methods,
   - algebraic approaches to logics of programs, modal and dynamic logics,
     interval and temporal logics
   - algebraic semantics of programming languages
   - graph theory and combinatorial optimisation
   - games, automata and language theory
   - mechanised and automated reasoning, decision procedures
   - spatio-temporal reasoning, knowledge acquisition, preference and
     scaling methods
   - information systems.

The predecessors of this conference were held in Dagstuhl (January 1994),
Parati (September 1995), Hammamet (January 1997), Warsaw (September
1998), Quebec (January 2000), Dagstuhl (February 2001), Oisterwijk (October
2001), Malente (April 2003), St. Catherines (January 2005), Manchester
(September 2006) and Frauenwoerth (April 2008).

5) Proceedings and Submission

All papers will be formally reviewed. We plan to publish the =20
proceedings in the
series Lecture Notes in Computer Science ready at  the  conference. The
proceedings editors will be R. Berghammer, A. Jaoua and B. M=F6ller.
Submissions must be in English, in postscript or pdf format, and =20
provide sufficient
information to judge their merits. They must be unpublished and not =20
submitted for
publication elsewhere. They may not exceed 15 pages in Springer LNCS style
and must be produced with LaTeX.  Additional material may be provided by a
clearly marked appendix or a reference to a manuscript on a website. This ma=
y
be considered at the discretion of the PC. Deviation from these requirements
may cause immediate rejection. One author of each accepted paper is expected
to present the paper at the conference.

Detailed instructions for electronic submission can be found at
the conference website. Formatting instructions and the LNCS style
files can be obtained via
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

As for the earlier conferences of this series, it is also intended to =20
publish a
selection of the best papers in revised and extended form in a special =20
issue of
the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming (JLAP).

6) Student Programme

The  conference  will be accompanied by a PhD training  program.
Details will be published in due time in a special call and on the
conference website.

7) Venue

Doha is the capital city of Qatar. With a population of about 1500.000 =20
inhabitants
it is the largest city of Qatar and its economic and cultural center. =20
The city is
located on the Persian Gulf. The university of Qatar at Doha was opened in t=
he
year 1973. Doha is also home of many international schools.

Doha has an international airport that is served by many international
(e.g., Turkish Airway, by British Airways from London-Heathrow, Lufthansa fr=
om
Frankfurt, KLM from Amsterdam and Qatar Airways from New York-JFK and
Osaka-Kansai).
