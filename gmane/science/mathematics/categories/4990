By "category of presheaves on J" I had in mind retaining J as part of it.

Oops, right, I was mixing up cocomplete and cocompletion-of.  (Actually
I don't think in terms of either, I find it easier to think of
[J^op,Set] as the maximal dense extension of J up to equivalence, in the
sense that all dense extensions of J are full subcategories of it.)
