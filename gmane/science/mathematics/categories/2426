Any study of the category must begin with Isbell's wonderful book on the
subject.  Although John's exposition could be difficult, it was not so in
that book.  I don't recall about limits and colimits (but they ought to be
easy), but there is a lot of discussion of internal homs (which do not
always exist and are not symmetric when they do).  The category is not
cartesian closed.  I am pretty sure the forgetful functor to Top has a
left adjoint and therefore preserves limits.  It preserves sums for sure,
but not coequalizers since a quotient space of a hausdorff uniform space
can be hausdorff without being completely regular.  At least, that is what
I think I remember.
