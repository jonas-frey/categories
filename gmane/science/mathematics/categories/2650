Colin had asked about cohomology theory for not necessarily Grothendieck
toposes.

A specific question concerning topos cohomology is the following:

Does every geometric morphism have right-derived functors on abelian
objects?

In principle, this would not require enough injectives
since the universal property requested does not involve any specific
kind of resolution.
