Dear reader of the "categories" list,

Next spring the Laboratoire de Math=C3=A9matiques Pures et Appliqu=C3=A9es=
  of the Universit=C3=A9 du Littoral (Calais, France) will hire a =
"ma=C3=AEtre de conf=C3=A9rences" (lecturer, tenured) for its Algebra =
group. The website of the Algebra group is:
    http://lmpa.univ-littoral.fr/spip.php?page=3Darticle&id_article=3D4

The research profile for this position will most probably be "algebraic =
combinatorics", but I was told that this is to be taken to include such =
things as operads, (algebra in) monoidal categories, species, polynomial =
functors, simplicial sets, props, ... so basically any field of algebra =
of which you can convince the hiring committee that it involves some =
interesting combinatorics. The position also involves teaching (in =
French).

Caveat: to apply for this position, one must already have a =
"qualification" in "section 25" of the Comit=C3=A9 National des =
Universit=C3=A9s (http://cnu25.emath.fr). Unfortunately, the deadline to =
apply for such a "qualification" (which involves some bureaucracy but is =
otherwise straightforward) has already passed.

The position will normally be made official in February 2018 via the =
website of the French ministry of higher education:
    =
https://www.galaxie.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/ensup/candidats.html=

However, those interested can already contact Prof. Lo=C3=AFc Foissy =
(loic.foissy@univ-littoral.fr) who is in charge of the hiring committee; =
it is not uncommon to propose to come give a talk in Calais prior to the =
start of the application procedure.

Even though I am not involved in this hiring procedure, I can of course =
try to reply to any questions you may have.

Best wishes,

Isar Stubbe.
