Special Session "New Directions in Category Theory"? - Call for Speakers


October 16-18, 2014, the Fall 2014 AMS Eastern Sectional Meeting is held in=
  Halifax, NS.
We are organizing a special session entitled "New directions in category th=
eory" and would like to invite those
who are interested in speaking to contact us. It will be helpful for us if =
you include a title, but that is not necessary.


Unfortunately, the AMS does not provide travel funds for speakers, but ther=
e is travel funding for graduate students (and a reduced registration rate)=
  so we encourage any interested graduate students to attend this meeting (a=
nd give talks!). The website with further details (including the applicatio=
n procedure and deadline) about this funding is  http://www.ams.org/student=
-travel.


Since we don't expect people to want to travel out east twice this October =
we have decided that this session will replace the

Octoberfest in Category Theory for this year, and we will plan a dinner for=
  the participants in this session on Saturday evening.
