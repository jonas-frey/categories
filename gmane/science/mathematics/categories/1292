*-Autonomous categories: once more around the track

Michael Barr

 This represents a new and more comprehensive approach to the
*-autonomous categories constructed in the monograph [Barr, 1979].
The main tool in the new approach is the Chu construction.  The main
conclusion is that the category of separated extensional Chu objects for
certain kinds of equational categories is equivalent to two usually
distinct subcategories of the categories of uniform algebras of those
categories.

A bicategorical approach to static modules

Renato Betti

The purpose of this paper is to indicate some bicategorical 
properties of ring theory. In this interaction, static modules are analyzed.

The categorical theory of self-similarity

Peter Hines

We demonstrate how the identity $N\otimes N \cong N$ in a monoidal
category allows us to construct a functor from the full subcategory
generated by $N$ and $\otimes$ to the endomorphism monoid of the object
$N$. This provides a categorical foundation for one-object analogues of
the symmetric monoidal categories used by J.-Y. Girard in his Geometry of
Interaction series of papers, and explicitly described in terms of inverse
semigroup theory in [6,11]. 

This functor also allows the construction of one-object analogues of other
categorical structures. We give the example of one-object analogues of the
categorical trace, and compact closedness. Finally, we demonstrate how the
categorical theory of self-similarity can be related to the algebraic
theory (as presented in [11]), and Girard's dynamical algebra, by
considering one-object analogues of projections and inclusions.

A Note on Rewriting Theory for Uniqueness of Iteration

M. Okada and P. J. Scott

Uniqueness for higher type term constructors in lambda calculi (e.g. 
surjective pairing for product types, or uniqueness of iterators on the
natural numbers) is easily expressed using universally quantified
conditional equations.  We use a technique of Lambek [18] involving
Mal'cev operators to equationally express uniqueness of iteration (more
generally, higher-order primitive recursion) in a simply typed lambda
calculus, essentially Godel's T [29,13].  We prove the following facts
about typed lambda calculus with uniqueness for primitive recursors:  
(i)  It is undecidable, (ii)  Church-Rosser fails, although ground
Church-Rosser holds, (iii) strong normalization (termination) is still
valid.  This entails the undecidability of the coherence problem for
cartesian closed categories with strong natural numbers objects, as well
as providing a natural example of the following computational paradigm:  a
non-CR, ground CR, undecidable, terminating rewriting system.

Contravariant Functors on Finite Sets and Stirling Numbers

Robert Pare

Contravariant Functors on Finite Sets and Stirling Numbers We characterize
the numerical functions which arise as the cardinalities of contravariant
functors on finite sets, as those which have a series expansion in terms
of Stirling functions. We give a procedure for calculating the
coefficients in such series and a concrete test for determining whether a
function is of this type. A number of examples are considered.

Comparing coequalizer and exact completions

M. C. Pedicchio and J. Rosicky

We characterize when the coequalizer and the exact completion of a
category $\cal C$ with finite sums and weak finite limits coincide.

Enriched Lawvere theories

John Power

We define the notion of enriched Lawvere theory, for enrichment over a
monoidal biclosed category $V$ that is locally finitely presentable as a
closed category. We prove that the category of enriched Lawvere theories
is equivalent to the category of finitary monads on $V$.  Moreover, the
$V$-category of models of a Lawvere $V$-theory is equivalent to the
$V$-category of algebras for the corresponding $V$-monad. This all extends
routinely to local presentability with respect to any regular cardinal. We
finally consider the special case where $V$ is $Cat$, and explain how the
correspondence extends to pseudo maps of algebras.

Epimorphic regular contexts

Robert Raphael

A von Neumann regular extension of a semiprime ring naturally defines a
epimorphic extension in the category of rings.  These are studied, and
four natural examples are considered, two in commutative ring theory, and
two in rings of continuous functions.

Natural deduction and coherence for non-symmetric linearly 
distributive categories

Robert R. Schneck

In this paper certain proof-theoretic techniques of [BCST] are applied to
non-symmetric linearly distributive categories, corresponding to
non-commutative negation-free multiplicative linear logic (mLL).  First,
the correctness criterion for the two-sided proof nets developed in [BCST]
is adjusted to work in the non-commutative setting.  Second, these proof
nets are used to represent morphisms in a (non-symmetric) linearly
distributive category; a notion of proof-net equivalence is developed
which permits a considerable sharpening of the previous coherence results
concerning these categories, including a decision procedure for the
equality of maps when there is a certain restriction on the units.  In
particular a decision procedure is obtained for the equivalence of proofs
in non-commutative negation-free mLL without non-logical axioms.
