             Research Fellow/Postdoc position
          in Category Theory, Logic and Computation,
               University of Ottawa

The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Ottawa
is looking to hire (at least) two research fellow/postdocs beginning in
September, 2010. The Category Theory, Logic and Computation Group in the
department hopes to obtain one of these positions for a postdoc in any
area of category theory, categorical logic, and related areas of
theoretical computer science.

Research fellows/postdocs will participate in the activities of the Logic
and Foundations of Computation Group. This group includes faculty and
students from several different Ottawa-area universities. In the Math
Department, the Logic Group currently includes 4 faculty members (R.
Blute, P. Hofstra, P.E. Parent and P. Scott), as well as a number of
postdocs and graduate students. For more information about our team, see
http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~phil/lfc/.

The research fellowships/postdocs are initially for one year, with a
possible renewal for a second year. Duties include research and the
teaching of two one-semester mathematics courses. Potential applicants
should contact one of us (preferably cc to all)::

   Richard Blute  (rblute at uottawa.ca)
   Pieter Hofstra (phofstra at uottawa.ca)
   Paul-Eugene Parent (pparent at uottawa.ca)
   Philip Scott  (phil at site.uottawa.ca)

immediately by email to indicate their interest. They should then also
send a curriculum vitae, a research plan, and arrange for three
confidential letters of recommendation, with one addressing teaching, to
be sent to Professor David McDonald, Chairman, Department of Mathematics
and Statistics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON Canada, K1N 6N5.
Applicants are also encouraged to include up to three copies of their most
significant publications.

Details about the postdoc position can be found here.
