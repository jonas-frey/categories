Dear all,

Some of my recent contributions to SDG are posted on arXiv:

1) Most recently (Dec. 2016):
"Metric spaces and SDG" (version 3) - a corrected version of a preprint  po=
sted on arxiv:1610.10005 version 1 and 2. (I apologize if anybody has waste=
d time with the puzzling redundancies and holes in the first two versions!)
This preprint relates SDG with the theory of some metric spaces advanced by=
  Busemann in the years 1943-1970 (and he called, quite justified,  his theo=
ry "Synthetic Differential Geometry" !).

2) Also, I posted on arXiv:1508.04322, "Affine combinations in affine schem=
es": out of mutual neighbour points in an affine scheme, one can form arbit=
rary affine combinations. In a different context, this technique was used f=
or many of the constructions in my book Synthetic Geometry of Manifolds (20=
10).

3) Finally, arXiv:1610.00286 is a survey talk "New methods for old spaces: =
synthetic differential geometry", presented as an invited contribution to t=
he workshop (and forthcoming book) organized by M. Anel and G. Catren "New =
spaces in Mathematics and Physics",  Paris IHP 2015.

These three contributions  concentrate on the combinatorial neighbour relat=
ion in geometry, and how it carries along with it diffenential-geometric no=
tions, like "touching", "envelopes", ... - without resorting to differentia=
l calculus.
