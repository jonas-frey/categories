I have just (and finally!) sent off to Elsevier the package of papers
to appear in the special issue of JPAA in honour of Mike Barr's 60th
birthday.  Readers of this list may be interested in the final "table
of contents" - note that this volume still has to go through
Elsevier's editorial process, so it may be a little while yet before
we see the finished product on the shelf.
