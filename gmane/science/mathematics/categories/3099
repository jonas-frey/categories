I was trying to elicit an open response from those who *do* know about the
value (or lack of it) of categorical string theory. In particular, I would
like to have an answer to this question. Why is it that anything which even
remotedly claims to have applications to physics (particularly string
theory) is
given (what I view as) uncritical support in our circles?

Best,
