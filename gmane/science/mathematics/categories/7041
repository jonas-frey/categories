Some short remarks from a dilettante in universal algebra, category
theory and philosophy:

I came along the unsatisfactory asymmetry in the category SET when
looking at coalgebras and asking about coequations some years ago.
Having in mind that kernels play a central role in universal algebra I
was expecting that co-kernels should play a similar role in universal
coalgebra. One can easily dualize the kernel reasoning. Such a
dualization, however, looks kind of artificial since a co-kernel just
provides a "strange coding" of the image of a map, i.e., a subset, so
to speak. One can identify the asymmetry by looking at exponentiation,
but isn't the asymmetry already related to the fact that SET is a
distributive category, i.e., that addition is trivial and boring
compared to multiplication?

My interest in coalgebras was also a kind of philosophically
triggered. The "classical western scientific cultur" relies and
focusses on the existence of "objects/things" and the category SET is
somehow the abstract essence of this perception of the world as a
bunch of objects/things which are assumed to be identifiable and
existing until the end of the time. Buddhistic and/or dialectical
reasoning, in contrast, perceives the world as a net of mutual
dependent and interweaved "processes". So, my question was if there is
anything in mathematics reflecting on a formal level this buddhistic
and dialectical reasoning based on "processes". I don't consider
coalgebras in SET as such formalization. Those coalgebras are based on
"object/thing reasoning" thus they can only give an approximation of
the philosophical concept of a "process", namely in terms of
distinctions and observations.
