The paper linked below is an example of a "success story" that I have =
recently described to sponsors who want to know what use category theory =
has been to other parts of mathematics.  In my opinion, the fact that =
category theory provided not only new insights into semantics of full =
first-order S4 modal logic but also semantics of higher-order S4 helps =
build the bridge mentioned above.

One sponsor had his own example (see the link below which he brought to =
my attention) which has generated a lot of interest among my colleagues =
at work since "network analysis" is one of our primary business areas.

I am still working through the following but think it also contributes =
to the bridge.
