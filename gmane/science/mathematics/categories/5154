In that context I am wondering about the following:

it would be nice to have a notion of directed topological space that
would extend the relation between (nice) topological spaces and
oo-groupoids to one between (nice) directed topological spaces and
(oo,1)-categories.

More generally, it would be nice to have a notion of "r-directed
topological space" for r in N that would extend the relation between
(nice) topological spaces and oo-groupoids to one of (nice)
"r-directed spaces" and (oo,r)-cateories.

(Probably such a notion of directed spaces can't be supporrted by
plain topological spaces with direction information, but requires
filtered directed spaces or the like. )

Has anything like this been considered?
