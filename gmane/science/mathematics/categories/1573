Dear Colleagues:

Dr. S. J. Vickers has found two typographical errors in my July 12 =
contribution which might well lead someone to conclude that an erroneous =
one-sided operation on an inequality had been made.  The statement =
"....so the converted form reads: (1 - x + y)y^^2 =3D -/1 - x + y/y^^2 > =
k," shoud have a second constant k1 or k2 (it is arbitrary which =
notation is used) replacing k.  I used the same k by a typographical =
error and also because I had skipped an intermediate step and in my =
haste used the same constant k from before.  The intermediate step was =
merely to consider what happens to xy when the conversion of y/x to 1 - =
x + y is made.   Then xy converts to (1 - x + y)y^^2 =3D -/1 - x + =
y/y^^2 in the case when 1 - x + y < 0, and this is obviously =
nonpositive, so -/1 - x + y/y^^2 < k2 with k2 =3D 0 for example.  For 1 =
- x + y > 0, we have xy converting to /1 - x + y/y^^2 which is =
nonnegative and therefore /1 - x + y/y^^2 > =3D k2 with k2 =3D 0 again.  =


Vickers'  criticism turned out to be very fortunate, not only for =
clarifying the typographical error and avoiding the wrong conclusion =
that I operated on only one side of an inequality when converting xy to =
the other form, but also in my developing a detailed argument concerning =
when the conversion from y/x to 1 - x + y becomes an actual function.   =
This occurs, for example, when y/x is a reduced proper or improper =
fraction in the sense that numerator and denominator have no common =
primes, in which case the unique factorization into primes and =
consideration of the three cases y/x > 1 and y/x < 1 and y/x =3D 1 leads =
to the conclusion that the conversion is a function.  Thus, on the =
reduced rationals, we have a function.  This is not a bad set to work =
with mathematically, and certainly provides a nontrivial case where the =
conversion is a function and is accurate.

I hope that S. J. Vickers will continue to contribute to further =
discussion in this thread because of his important contributions, =
provided of course that he continues to emphasize the correction of =
errors and ways of further applying the conversions.  If somebody finds =
any further errors in my future writings, please give me the benefit of =
considering the possibility that I made a typographical error.
