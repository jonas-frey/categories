There is another curiosity about the axioms for a category, namely the
infuence of the known axioms for a groupoid (Brandt, 1926). Bill Cockcroft
told me that these axioms had influenced E-M. These axioms were well used in
the algebra group at Chicago.  However when I asked Sammy about this in 1985
he firmly said `no, and was why the notion of groupoid did not appear as an
example in the E-M paper'!

Perhaps it was a case of forgetting the influence?
