Zeeman proved the assertion in 1955 for non-measurable cardinals n.  Ther=
e
are more general results which comprise the theory of slender (abelian)
groups; see, e.g., Chapter XIII, Sections 94-95 of [L. Fuchs, Infinite
Abelian Groups vol. 2, Academic Press, 1973], especially Corollary 94.6 o=
n
p 162.

I haven't thought much about abelian groups since the early 1960's, but i=
t
is well known that infinite direct products have very interesting
properties, both as abstract and as topological groups.  For example, a
closed subgroup of a direct product of countably many copies of  Z  is
also a direct product, but not so for uncountable products (see [R.J.
Nunke, On direct products of infinite cyclic groups, Proc. Amer. Math.
Soc. 13 (1962), pp 66-71]).  In fact, Zeeman's result implies that a
countable free group is a closed subgroup of a direct product with
uncountably many factors.  A generalization of Nunke's theorem and some
related results are contained in my old paper [Function topologies on
abelian groups, Ill. J. Math. 7 (1963), pp 593-608].

Many years ago (at least 45) Harrison mentioned to me that for any n
(including infinite cardinals), Hom(Z^n,Z) =3D n.Z, in other words the
Z-dual of the product is the sum.  This is obviously a very special
property of Z, almost the negation of injectivity.  Has anyone on this
list ever seen this before and can give me a reference?
