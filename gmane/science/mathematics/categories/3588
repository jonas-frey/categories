My recollection is that in the original definition only pullbacks of
regular epis as well as kernel pairs were assumed to exist.  Although you
could just assume that when the pullback of a regular epi exists it is a
regular epic, I think that would vitiate the definition.  However, one
possibility that I have known of for a long time but not written about is
to suppose that when A --> B is regular epic and B' --> B is arbitrary and
you look at all pairs A' --> A, A' --> B' that make the evident square
commute, then the family of all those A' --> B' is an effective epic
family.  In that category, a pullback, if it exists, is terminal.
