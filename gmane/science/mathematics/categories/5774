Andre points out:

"To call a monoidal category 1-braided is kind of
confusing because there is no commutation structure
on a general monoidal category. A monoidal category is 0-braided."

Being an outsider, with no previous neither usage or opinion on this=20
terminology beyond just monoidal and/or tensor category, this seems to=20
me definitive, and more than enough to settle the question.
