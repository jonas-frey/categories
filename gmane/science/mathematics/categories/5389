Dear John, et al,

i totally agree! Back when i was pushing the process algebras into the
corporate software sector i would regularly "shame" exec/engineers who
claimed the formalism too complex by demonstrating that i could teach the
=CF=80-calculus to 13 year-old's and they could use it, fruitfully. There a=
re
branches of mathematics that really require steady application to a steep
learning curve for an extended period of time, but there are many --
computation and category theory being among them -- where there is a core
that really is accessible to anyone with a certain penchant for abstraction=
.
Engaged and engaging teachers and practitioners are a key ingredient --
without which many go hungry at the table of mathematics.

Best wishes,

--greg
