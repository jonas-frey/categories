Dear Peter

I was also a participant at the Oberwolfach 1966 meeeting as you may
recall, and heard Lawvere give his lecture. Although I cannot find my own=
=A0notes, those of Anders Kock bring back my recollection of it. The
following is relevant to your comments. I myself gave there a talk about=A0=
an aspect of my thesis -- namely a characterization of functor categories=
=A0("diagrammatic categories") based on what I called "regular categories,=
=A0a Set-version of your abelian categories, as well as on=A0Bill's idea, e=
xpressed=A0in his lecture, that, thinking of the category of=A0=A0ordered s=
ets, the analogue of=A0Sets^{C} is 2^{\Lambda}. This analogue led to=A0the =
idea of atoms in order to=A0emphasize the analogous characterization of=A0c=
omplete atomic Boolean algebras=A0as fields of sets.=A0
For the record, my=A0thesis (Marta C. Bunge Categories of Set-valued functo=
rs, University=A0of=A0Pennsylvania 1966) was unpublished as such and only p=
arts of it in a=A0different version appeared three years after completion (=
Marta C. Bunge "Relative=A0Functor Categories and Categories of Algebras" J=
=2E Algebra 11-1 1969,=A064-101), at the=A0insistence of Saunders Mac Lane,=
 who communicated my paper. =A0
About profunctors. My thesis as you may recall contains an entire=A0chapter=
 (III) on equivalences of diagrammatic categories and adjoint=A0functors be=
tween them. Theorem 14.1 states that for M any complete=A0category and B a =
small category Adj(Sets^B M) \equiv M^{B\op}. In=A0particular Adj(Sets^B\, =
Sets^C) \equiv (Sets^C)^{B\op} \equiv Sets^{B\op x=A0C}.=A0Relevant to this=
 is a previous paper by Michel Andre, Categories of=A0functors and adjoint =
functors, Batelle Reports, Geneve 1964, which I quote=A0both in my thesis a=
nd in the J. Algebra paper.=A0
It is furthermore remarked=A0in my thesis that, when I is a discrete catego=
ry,=A0the statement Adj(\Sets^I \, Sets^I)=A0\equiv Sets^{I x I) has an obv=
ious interpretation=A0analogous to that which=A0exists between endomorphism=
s of a vector space and matrices.=A0This remark=A0was further expanded (sec=
tion III.14) into a discussion of the analogue of=A0matrix multiplication f=
or "profunctors". Therefore, although I do not=A0recollect Benabou's lectur=
e=A0or what followed it, Bill's lecture and my own=A0thesis are, for me, en=
ough indication of priority=A0over Benabou's distributeurs.=A0
Thanks for giving me this opportunity to comment on a meeting that I had=A0=
forgotten about.=A0
Best regards
Marta
