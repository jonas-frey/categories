    Call for paper for the special issue of Fundamenta Informaticae
on "Machines, Computations and Universality".

    This call for paper is open to everyone (it is not restricted to the
participant of MCU '07).

    After the success of MCU '07 at Orleans (France), in Sept. 10-13,
2007, a special issue of Fundamenta Informaticae will be published with
contributions on the topics of the conference, which include the following:

   Digital computation (fundamental classical models):
     Turing machines, register machines, word processing (groups and
     monoids), other machines.
   Digital models of computation:
     cellular automata, other automata, tiling of the plane, polyominoes,
     snakes, neural networks, molecular computations,
   Analog and Hybrid Computations:
     BSS machines, infinite cellular automata, real machines,
     quantum computing, computable analysis, abstract geometrical
     computation.

   In all these settings:
     frontiers between a decidable halting problem and an undecidable one
        in the various computational settings
     minimal universal codes:
        size of such a code, namely, for Turing machines, register
        machines, cellular automata, tilings, neural nets, Post systems
     computation complexity of machines with a decidable halting problem
        as well as universal machines,
     connections between decidability under some complexity class and
        completeness according to this class,
     self-reproduction and other tasks,
     universality and decidability in the real field.

    Submissions will be refereed and here are the dates for the process:

    submission dead-line:                    April 10th, 2008 (strict)
    notification of accetance/rejection :    September, 1st, 2008
    final version due:                       December, 1st, 2008

    If you already have a published contribution in the proceedings of
the conference (LNCS 4664), we draw your attention on the following:
your submission must be sustantially different from the paper of LNCS:
it must either contain significantly new results or important proofs
that could not be included in the LNCS format; we have to strictly
apply this rule.

    Send your submission to the following address:

            margens@univ-metz.fr

    It is important that your submission applies FI's format (see FI's
site: http://fi.mimuw.edu.pl/) for your contribution to be
examined. There is no apriori limit on the number of pages. The format
of FI is large and, in principle, 30 pages is a reasonable limit. If
you actually need more,please contact us.


     Jerome Durand-Lose, Maurice Margenstern,
       co-chairs of MCU '07
