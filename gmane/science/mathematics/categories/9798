CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on Semantic Spaces at the Intersection of NLP, Physics, and =
Cognitive Sciences

Part of ESSLLI 2019 (http://esslli2019.folli.info/)

August 5th - 9th 2019
Riga, Latvia

https://sites.google.com/view/semspace2019/home

****

AIMS AND SCOPE
Vector embeddings of word meanings have become a mainstream tool in =
large scale natural language processing tools. The use of vectors to =
represent meanings in semantic spaces or feature spaces is also employed =
in cognitive science. Unrelated to natural language and cognitive =
science, vectors and vector spaces have been extensively used as models =
of physical theories and especially the theory of quantum mechanics. =
Crucial similarities between the vector representations of quantum =
mechanics and those of natural language are exhibited via bicompact =
linear logic and compact closed categorical structures in natural =
language.

Exploiting the common ground provided by vector spaces, the proposed =
workshop will bring together researchers working at the intersection of =
NLP, cognitive science, and physics, offering to them an appropriate =
forum for presenting their uniquely motivated work and ideas. The =
interplay between these three disciplines will foster theoretically =
motivated approaches to understanding how meanings of words interact =
with each other in sentences and discourse via grammatical types, how =
they are determined by input from the world, and how word and sentence =
meanings interact logically.

Topics of interests include (but are not restricted to):
Reasoning in semantic spaces
Compositionality in semantic spaces and conceptual spaces
Conceptual spaces in linguistics and natural language processing
Applications of quantum logic in natural language processing and =
cognitive science
Modelling functional words such as prepositions and relative pronouns in =
compositional distributional models of meaning
Diagrammatic reasoning for natural language processing and cognitive =
science
Modelling so-called =E2=80=98non-compositional=E2=80=99 phenomena such =
as metaphor

IMPORTANT DATES:
25th April 2019: Paper submission
1st June 2019: Notification to contributors
5th-9th August: Workshop dates

Professor Ruth Kempson FBA, Emeritus Professor of Linguistics, King's =
College, London, UK
Dr Sanjaye Ramgoolam, Reader in Theoretical Physics, Queen Mary =

Original contributions (up to 12 pages) of previously unpublished work. =
Submission of substantial, albeit partial results of work in progress is =
welcomed.

separately published paper or preprint.
