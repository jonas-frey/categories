Well, you might want to look at this:

\item  (With. M.-A. Knus), Extensions of Derivations. Proc. Amer.
      Math. Soc. {\bf 28} (1971), 313--314.

This is more homological algebra than category theory. The story is that
someone had done this in a special case (where the center was local I
think) in a dozen pages and someone else had extended it to semilocal and
Knus was lecturing at the ETH on his extension to arbitrary centers (but
the ambient ring was always semi-simple = Hochschild dimension 0).  As
Knus was lecturing I said to myself that there had to be a better way.
And there was.  It took only a paragraph and use only Hochschild dimension
1 besides.  The rest of the two pages was intro and bibliography.

Although it isn't category theory it exemplifies the categorical way of
thinking, dealing with generic properties and the like.

Incidentally, the paper was originally rejected.  The referee's report
said, "The only possible reason for publishing this is that it has been so
badly handled in the literature"!  I would have thought that an excellent
reason to publish it.  Only the fact that the editor was a personal friend
who said he would publish it if I insisted, allowed it to see the light of
day.  But I have long thought it a "proof from the book".
