Is there a reference for the fact that a countable decidably ordered field
has a constructable (and decidably ordered) real closure?

Maybe 20 years ago, an undergraduate did a project under my supervision
proving exactly that (although the proofs are not constructive). While I
don't think it would prove feasible for actual computation, the fact that
it exists is interesting.  Finally, I have looked more closely at it and
if it is not known, I think it publishable.  Unfortunately, the student
(who was a Commonwealth Fellow at Cambridge) lost interest in math and is
doing other things.  But I think I know how to get in touch with him.
