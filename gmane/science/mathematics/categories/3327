=======================================================================
CWI: 1 PhD Position and 1 Postdoc Position in the CREDO Project
=======================================================================

The theme SEN3 Coordination Languages at CWI (http://www.cwi.nl) has
1 PhD position for four years and 1 postdoc position for three years.

Both positions are within the IST-33826 research CREDO project
"Modeling and analysis of evolutionary structures for distributed services",
recently funded by the European Union.
This project starts September 1, 2006, and lasts for three years.
The objective of this project is the development and application of an
integrated suite of tools for compositional modelling, testing, and
validation of software for evolving networks of dynamically reconfigurable
components.
More information on this project can be found at the following webpage:
http://www.cwi.nl/projects/credo.

Job description
---------------
The candidates are expected to work on the design and development of
a new high-level modelling language Credo
for the dynamic composition of highly reconfigurable component-based
software systems, and light-weight and automated verification
techniques and tools supporting this language.
The main overall idea of Credo is
the integration of  a formal component model based on concurrent
objects which support run-time updates with a new model of component
connectors based on mobile channels.
The main objective of this integration is to support
rapid prototyping and automated validation of networks of distributed
services implemented by components, focusing on analyzing the effect
of dynamic reconfiguration.
The kernel of the Credo tool will consists of
an abstract interpreter for the language implemented in the rewriting logic
of the Maude system (http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu).
The abstract interpreter forms the basis
for the development and integration of simulation, testing and
validation tools for the compositional analysis of functional, timing,
and resource requirements.

Bothe candidates should have a background in software engineering,
concurrency and distributed systems, and practical software
development or formal methods.
The PhD candidate should have at least a master degree in computer science
and the candidate for the postdoc position should have a PhD degree
in computer science.
