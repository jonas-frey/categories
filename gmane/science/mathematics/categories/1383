I can answer this for equilogical spaces.

The functor F: Bi[Equ] ---> Bi[Equ] has a final coalgebra. It
is the equilogical space (C, ~) where C is the Cantor space

        C = 2^N = infinite sequences of 0's and 1's

and ~ is the equivalence relation defined by

        a ~ b  iff  r(a) = r(b)

where r: C --> [0,1] is defined by

        r(a) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k / 2^{k+1}

(This equivalence relation can easily be defined without reference to
the closed interval [0,1].) Thus, the final coalgebra is the
_(unsigned) binary digit representation_ of the closed interval [0,1].
The structure map d: (C,~) ---> F(C,~) is induced by the canonical
isomorphism C ---> C + C = 2 x C.

Unfortunately, this closed interval is not what we would hope for.
Ideally, we would want the _signed_ binary digit representation of
the interval [-1,1], i.e., the space ({-1,0,1}^N, :=:) where :=: is
defined by

        a :=: b  iff  s(a) = s(b)

        s(a) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k / 2^{k+1}

We want this because the real numbers object in Equ is the built from
the _signed_ representation of reals.

I do not see how to adapt the construction so that it yields the
signed representation. We would have to "glue" more than just a couple 
of points. But how do we say what should be glued, without reference
to [0,1] or C?

Let me explain briefly why (C, ~) is the final coalgebra. In Equ, in
the pushout

      1 -------> X
      |          |
      |          |
      |          |
      |          |
      V          V
      X -------> FX

the underlying space of FX is |FX| = |X| + |X|. This is a "small" but
crucial difference between Top and Equ. We can first find the final
coalgebra in Top_0 for the functor A --> A + A, which is the Cantor
space C, and then compute the equivalence relation on C. In this case
it is easy to verify that all the continuous maps obtained from the
coalgebraic structure of C actually preserve the equivalence
relations. By the way, the two distinguished points of (C, ~) are
0^\infty and 1^\infty, of course (and it doesn't matter, since C is
homogeneous).
