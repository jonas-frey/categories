Indeed they don't teach you this at the university=2C but somehow i always =
knew it.

It was obvious from the start=2C then i had to resist everyone trying to te=
ll me otherwise.

I am glad that there are other who see this as well.

I like this quote since i like structuralizing mathematics.

Something to think about if you want to take the next step.

Fill in the void with a precise mathematical void.
