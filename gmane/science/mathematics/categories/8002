Dear Colleagues,

Please find below details of the

Kind Regards,

The Midlands Graduate School (MGS) in the Foundations of Computing Science
is a collaboration between researchers at the Universities of Birmingham,
Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield. It was established in 1999. The MGS
has two main goals: to provide PhD students with a sound basis for
research in the mathematical and practical foundations of computing and to
give PhD students the opportunity to make contact with established
researchers in the field and their peers who are at a similar stage in
their research careers.

This year, the MGS is at the University of Nottingham. It will start on 22
April and finish on 26 April.

The fee is ?440, this includes on campus accommodation with breakfast,
lunches, coffees and a workshop dinner!
