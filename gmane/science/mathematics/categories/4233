The following are available from my preprint page, by me unless stated =
otherwise:=20

http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/brownpr.html

1) 08.04 Exact sequences of fibrations of crossed complexes, homotopy =
classification of maps, and nonabelian extensions of groups=20
ABSTRACT:  The classifying space of a crossed complex generalises the =
construction of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. We show how the theory of =
fibrations of crossed complexes allows the analysis of homotopy classes =
of maps from a free crossed complex to such a classifying space. This =
gives results on the homotopy classification of maps from a CW-complex =
to the classifying space of a crossed module and also, more generally, =
of a crossed complex whose homotopy groups vanish in dimensions between =
1 and n. The results are analogous to those for the obstruction to an =
abstract kernel in group extension theory.=20

2) 06.04 R. Brown, I. Morris, J. Shrimpton and C.D. Wensley=20

Graphs of morphisms of graphs=20

 ABSTRACT: This is an account for the combinatorially minded reader of =
various categories of directed and undirected graphs, and their =
analogies with the category of sets. As an application, the =
endomorphisms of a graph are in this context not only composable, giving =
a monoid structure, but also have a notion of adjacency, so that the set =
of endomorphisms is both a monoid and a graph. We extend Shrimpton's =
(unpublished) investigations on the morphism digraphs of reflexive =
digraphs to the undirected case by using an equivalence between a =
category of reflexive, undirected graphs and the category of reflexive, =
directed graphs with reversal. In so doing, we emphasise a picture of =
the elements of an undirected graph, as involving two types of edges =
with a single vertex, namely `bands' and `loops'. Such edges are =
distinguished by the behaviour of morphisms with respect to these =
elements.

3) Possible connections between whiskered categories and groupoids, many =
object Lie algebras, automorphism structures and local-to-global =
questions=20

ABSTRACT: We define the notion of whiskered categories and groupoids and =
discuss potential applications and extensions, for example to a many =
object Lie theory, and to resolutions of monoids. This paper is more an =
outline of a possible programme or programmes than giving conclusive =
results.=20

4) A new higher homotopy groupoid: the fundamental  globular =
$\omega$-groupoid  of a filtered space=20
MSC Classification:18D10, 18G30, 18G50, 20L05, 55N10, 55N25.
KEY WORDS: filtered space, higher homotopy van Kampen theorem, cubical =
singular complex, free globular  groupoid
ABSTRACT: We show that the graded set of filter homotopy classes rel =
vertices of maps from the $n$-globe to a filtered space may be given the =
structure of globular $\omega$--groupoid. The proofs use an analogous =
fundamental cubical $\omega$--groupoid due to the author and Philip =
Higgins. This method also relates the construction to the fundamental =
crossed complex of a filtered space, and this relation allows the proof =
that the crossed complex associated to the free globular =
$\omega$-groupoid on one element of dimension $n$ is the fundamental =
crossed complex of the $n$-globe.=20
