In my understanding of Heyting algebras/lattices/semilattices, excluded
middle fails for the algebras themselves but not for my understanding of
them, where the partial order x <= y in a Heyting algebra is either true
or false with no middle ground allowed.

I have had little luck absorbing the logic of Heyting algebras into my
own mathematical thinking.  I furthermore worry that if ever I were to
succeed my insights might become even less penetrating than they already
are.

On a related note, a careful reading of Max Kelly's "Basic Concepts of
Enriched Category Theory" reveals that it is thoroughly grounded in Set,
as I pointed out in August 2006 in my initial Wikipedia article on Max.
  I gave some thought to how one might eliminate Set from the treatment,
without much success, and concluded that Max's judgment there was spot on.

My feeling about these recommended Brouwerian modes of thoughts is that
they are something like locker room accounts of social and other
conquests: great stories about things that never actually happened, but
which with sufficient repetition convince one that they must surely have
occurred.

The self-evident is merely an hypothesis that is so convenient, and that
has been assumed for so long, that we can no longer imagine it false.
This is just as true for Excluded Middle itself as for its negation.  I
happen to find Excluded Middle more convenient than its negation, but
that's just me and perhaps others have had the opposite experience.

Then there are those who accept neither Excluded Middle nor its
negation, which takes us into the Hall of Mirrors that I always find
myself in when I go down this particular rabbit-hole.
