Dear

Dear Marta, Martin, Steve and Thomas,

I am considering using the word "logos" instead of "elementary topos".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos

The word "logos" has seldom been used in mathematics.
It is a noble word in philosophy where it means: reason, discourse, logic, =
knowledge, principle of order.

The category of sets is a boolean logos with natural number objects.
Every (Grothendieck) topos has the structure of a logos, but not every logo=
s is a topos.
The initial logos with natural number object and the effective logos are no=
t toposes.

A topos E over a base topos S can be regarded as a topos internal to the lo=
gos defined by S.
More generally, there is a notion of topos relative to a logos.

Best regards,
Andr=E9

Dear Martin, Andre, and Steve,


I will abstain from commenting on the "mystery" of univalence at least unti=
l I study the paper by Martin and Thomas (Streicher) which was made  kindly=
  made available to me but have not yet found the time to do so.


Since Martin in his latest mail goes back to the original question by Steve=
  which prompted some of this correspondence on and off categories, I point =
out that I had already accepted regarding Grothendieck toposes as S-bounded=
  elementary toposes for a given elementary topos S, as the idea is the same=
  as that of Grothendieck - namely sheaves on a site, without, however, spec=
ifying a set theory to be given by Set but by some unspecified elementary (=
base) topos S. It is not a matter of honesty but of revising the notion of =
a Grothendieck topos which arose before elementary toposes were introduced.


There was, however, another, in my view still not totally settled question =
in this forum, of whether the notion of an elementary topos ought to be equ=
ated with that of a "logical" topos as proposed by Andre, so that the "natu=
ral" morphisms bewteen them, according to him,  would be the logical morphi=
sms. As I already argued in this forum, the notion of an elementary topos i=
s no more logical than it is geometric, and the way to specify which will i=
t be in any given context is by the choice of morphisms - logical or geomet=
rical, with possibly further conditions in each case.


In connection with the latter, I came upon an old paper by Colin McLarty, "=
The uses and abuses of the history of topos theory", British J. Phil Sc. 41=
  (1990) 351--375, in which this issue is discussed at length. I reproduce t=
he abstract here:


"The view that toposes originated as a generalized set theory is a figment =
of set theoretically educated common sense. This false history obstructs un=
derstanding of category theory and specially of categorical foundations for=
  mathematics. Problems in geometry, topology, and related algebra led to ca=
tegories and toposes. Elementary toposes arose when Lawvere's interest in t=
he foundations of physics and Tierney's in the foundations of topology led =
both to study Grothendieck's foundations for algebraic geometry. I end with=
  remarks on a categorical view of the history of set theory, including a fa=
lse history plausible from that point of view that would make it helpful to=
  introduce toposes as a generalization of set theory."


I recommend readin this very interesting article.



Very best regards,

Marta

Subject: Re: categories: Re: Grothendieck toposes

And, to continue, I think it is slightly dishonest to say that
Grothendiek toposes are defined over Set, as if Set were one uniquely
determined thing. It is not, and we know that there are many things (as
soon as there is as least one) satisfying the axioms of set theory. Why
do we still speak of "the" category of sets, as if we would be able to
magically pin one "intended model" (with no precise specification)?
