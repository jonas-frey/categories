I agree with Vaughan.

Further, I have the feeling that "abutment" is not the appropriate way of
rendering into mathematical english the meaning of the word
"aboutissement" as it was used by Grothendieck.

I repeat, we should analyse the whole french sentence to come up with a
good translation.

Is it not possible that somebody (not very versant in either french or
english) had first the need to translate Grothendieck's "aboutissement",
and unlike Michael Barr who asked advise, just  came up  with "abutment"
(out of some dictionary).

and then, other people  (also not very good at either french or english)
in the same area just keep copying him  and each other?

and generated the whole cascade coming out of google . . .

who is to blame for the first use of "abutment" for Grothendieck's
"aboutissement" in mathematical english  ?   ja !!!

are we all going to follow ?

 I will be the first to use "abutment" if the word has a long tradition,
and some prestigious mathematicians have used it.

I finish with a question:  Is it the case here ?
