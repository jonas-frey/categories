CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

To the FACETS OF REALIZABILITY workshop.

https://project.inria.fr/realizability2019

Cachan (Paris), France, 1 - 3 July 2019.

REGISTRATION:

*** BEFORE JUNE 15TH ***

Registration is free but mandatory. We cover lunches and coffee breaks
for all participants. You can register by sending an e-mail to both
organizers with subject line ???[facets of realizability] registration???.

BACKGROUND:

The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in
realizability or whose research involves applications of realizability.
Here, ???realizability??? is to be understood in a very broad sense to
foster new ideas from interaction of people working on its different
aspects. The main focus will be realizability interpretations,
arithmetic, function and categorical realizability and in particular
work on the boundary between any of these. An example of a concept that
lies at the border between arithmetic and function realizability is the
principle of bar induction.

INVITED SPEAKER:

Paulo Oliva
