                        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                        IEEE Computer Society
         1998 International Conference on Computer Languages

                          Loyola University
                    Chicago, USA, 14--16 May, 1998

                            Sponsored by
    the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Computer Languages,
 in cooperation with the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages.

                   http://www.math.luc.edu/iccl98/

This is the sixth in a series of conferences devoted to all aspects of
computer languages, serving to bring together people broadly
interested in machine processable descriptions.  The hallmarks of ICCL
are diversity, openness to a wide range of linguistic research, and
international representation.  The focus is on new ideas in languages
and language technology which are innovative or experimental in
nature.

On May 13, a pre-conference Workshop on Internet Programming Languages
will be conducted at Loyola University.  Details are given at the end
of this announcement.

                             HOTELS

We have negotiated special rates for ICCL attendees at the Talbott Hotel
(+1-312-944-4970, 20 East Delaware Place) and at the Days Inn Lake Shore
Drive (+1-312-943-9200, 644 North Lake Shore Drive).
Please mention ICCL/Loyola University to get the special group rate.
The hotels require a room deposit guaranteed with a major credit card. 

Rooms for Saturday night (May 16) are very limited because of the annual
Chicago Restaurant Convention.  Therefore, attendees SHOULD BOOK THEIR
HOTEL ROOM FIRST and only then purchase a plane ticket second.

The Talbott is only a two-minute walk away from the conference site but has
fewer rooms available. The Days Inn is a fifteen-minute walk away from the
conference site.  Please see the ICCL web page
http://www.math.luc.edu/iccl98/  for details.


                          TRANSPORTATION

United Airlines is offering a 10% discount off the unrestricted mid-week
coach fare or 5% discount off the lowest applicable fares, including First
Class, to all attendees of ICCL '98. This special offer applies to travel on
domestic segments of all United Airlines, United Express and Shuttle-by-United
flights.  See the ICCL web page for details.  Information about
transportation from the Chicago airports to the hotels and conference site 
is also available from the ICCL web page.
