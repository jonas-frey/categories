Dear Colleague,

We would like to bring your attention to the (second) Call for Papers of =
the
ACCAT Workshop 2012.=20

NEWs: The paper submission deadline was extended to 23rd Dec. 2011.=20
Moreover, ACCAT now accepts also position papers.=20

We hope that you can participate in this workshop by submitting a paper
reflecting your current research.
Two types of papers are welcomed, regular papers (up to 15 pages) and
position papers (up to 8 pages).
The accepted regular papers and selected position papers will appear in
formal post-proceedings,=20
published as a volume of EPTCS. All accepted papers will appear in the =
local
proceedings of the ACCAT workshop.

Should you have any questions please don't hesitate contacting us.
On behalf of the organization team,

Thomas Soboll and Ulrike Golas.
{Apologies if you receive multiple postings}

Seventh ACCAT Workshop
on Applied and Computational
Category Theory (ACCAT 2012)

Tallinn, Estonia
Sun, April 01, 2012

(co-located with ETAPS 2012)

http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~tsoboll/ACCAT
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

HISTORY AND SCOPE:
    The originators of the ACCAT workshops are Hartmut Ehrig (Berlin)
    and Jochen Pfalzgraf (Salzburg) starting with the 1st ACCAT workshop =
at
ETAPS 2006.
    Category Theory is a well-known powerful mathematical modeling =
language
with a
    wide area of applications in mathematics and computer science, =
including
especially
    the semantical foundations of topics in software science and =
development.
    Categorical methods are already well established for the semantical
foundation of type theory
    (Cartesian closed categories), data type specification frameworks
(institutions) and
    graph transformation (adhesive high level replacement categories).


TOPICS for this workshop include but are not strictly limited to are:
    General Modeling Aspects
    Categorical, Algebraic, Geometric, Topological Modeling Aspects
    Petri Nets, Process Algebras, Activity Networks
    Logical Modeling, Unifying Frameworks
    Coalgebraic Methods in Systems Theory
    Generalized Automata, Categorical Methods


POST PROCEEDINGS:
    The camera-ready papers will appear in the local workshop =
proceedings,
    which are distributed on memory sticks.
    There will be formal post-proceedings containing all accepted regular
papers
    and selected position papers, published as a volume of EPTCS
    (Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science,
http://www.eptcs.org/).


SUBMISSION:
    Please provide your submission using the EPTCS style, and submit the
papers via the
    easychair link =
(http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Daccat2012).
    Regular Papers (should not exceed 15 pages).
    Position papers, presenting ideas of ongoing yet unpublished =
research,=20
    or presenting an aruable opinion about an issue, related to ACCAT
topics (should not exceed 8 pages).

REGISTRATION:
    Please follow the registration instructions at www.etaps.org.
    Note that the early registration for ETAPS 2012 ends at 29th Jannuary
2012.
