   The 68th meeting of the PSSL will be held at the Masaryk
University, Brno, Czech Republic over the weekend of 29-30
August 1998. It is organized in connection with the federated

MFCS\CSL and participants interested to stay in Brno the whole
week may contact Jan Staudek.
   As usual, the 68th meeting of the PSSL will be informal in
nature and it will be focused on category theory, logic and
theoretical computer science.

(single rooms, for 2 nights since Friday to Sunday) together with
breakfasts and lunches in a university restaurant. The cost is 80$ 
for those who will register till June 25th and 120$ for others. 
Participants wishing to stay in hotels should contact Jan Staudek.
   Brno is located about 200 km south-east of Prague and 130 km
north of Vienna and it can be reached from the both airports by
trains and buses. More details will be available in the second
announcement. We will maintain a www-page containing all
informations.
