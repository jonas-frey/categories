Dear Dusko,

your proposed definition of a non-evil dagger structure is a nice try,
but it doesn't work at all.

Before I dissect your definition, let me state again the reason why
*every* such definition will fail. It is a hard fact that the notion
of dagger, however defined, intrinsically does not transport along
equivalences. By "hard fact", I mean that it is a consequence of
examples, rather than definitions. There is no way to fudge the
definitions to make this fact go away, unless one changes the
definitions so radically that they no longer fit the fundamental
example.

The fundamental example is the category of finite dimensional complex
vector spaces vs. the category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.
They are equivalent, the latter has a dagger structure, and the former
does not. This shows that the notion is evil. For this argument, it is
irrelevant how dagger structure is actually defined (strict, weak,
abstract, concrete...): all that is required is that the definition is
strong enough to yield a notion of unitary map, and that this unitary
notion coincides with the "usual" one in the category of Hilbert
spaces.

Now let me comment on your definitions in detail.

> which make PX -| X.

Assuming here that the category is symmetric monoidal, this is
precisely the definition of a compact closed structure. The first two
conditions are redundant.

The point of Abramsky and Coecke's work on dagger categories was to
explain, in categorical terms, that the adjoint (i.e., dagger) of a
linear function f:A->B is *not* the same as the transpose. The adjoint
goes B -> A, whereas the transpose goes B* -> A*. This is something
people used to be confused about. Abramsky and Coecke cleared up the
confusion; the above definition reintroduces it.

To remove the distinction between a morphism B* -> A* and a morphism
B -> A, you next assume that each object A is equipped with a chosen
isomorphism A* -> A. (You actually assume chosen Frobenius algebra
structures, which is a stonger assumption, but only the isomorphisms
are needed for the present purpose). With this assumption, given a map
f : A -> B, we can take the transpose f* : B* -> A*, and then compose
it with the given isomorphisms to get a map B -> B* -> A* -> A.  This
is of the type required for a (strict) dagger structure.

There are a number of things wrong with this:

1) The main example, which is the category of finite dimensional
Hilbert spaces, does not have the structure you require. It isn't
equipped with chosen Frobenius structures (equivalently chosen bases),
nor with chosen isomorphisms A* -> A. However, to continue the
argument, let's assume that we have arbitrarily chosen such additional
structure.

2) In the main example, the category of finite dimensional Hilbert
spaces, your definition does not coincide with reality. Namely, the
*actual* definition of the adjoint of a linear map does not coincide
with what one gets as the result of your definition. To see this,
assume chosen bases, and note that the matrix of the map
B -> B* -> A* -> A is exactly the transpose of the matrix of
f : A -> B, in the given bases of A and B. On the other hand, the matrix
of f+ : B -> A is the adjoint.

3) Moreover, contrary to what you wrote, the structure of "having a
chosen Frobenius structure on each object" is itself an evil structure
on categories.  Namely, there will be some isomorphisms of the
category that don't preserve the Frobenius structure (think linear map
that does not preserve the chosen bases). Choose one such isomorphism
s : U -> V, and construct an equivalence F to some other category such
that the chosen isomorphism is sent to an identity.  By transporting
the Frobenius structure along F, you end up with two different
Frobenius structures on F(U)=F(V). So there is no coherent way to
transport. The same argument shows that the structure of "having a
chosen isomorphism A* -> A on each object" is also evil.

In summary, your definition does not coincide with the intended
example (linear adjoints in Hilbert spaces), and ends up being evil
anyway, so doesn't solve the problem. It also assumes too much
structure (for example, the usual definition of a dagger category
neither requires a monoidal structure nor a closed one. It works on
any category).

I hope we can agree that, to capture something essential about Hilbert
spaces, some amount of evil structure is required, and we should
embrace the evil definition and live with it. In fact, I am surprised
that there are not more well-known examples of evil structures in
category theory. In principle, any structure that allows the
definition of a distinguished subcategory of isomorphisms (in this
case, the unitary ones) should be evil. Does anybody know further
examples?
