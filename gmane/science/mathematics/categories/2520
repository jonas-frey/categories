The workshop is held in conjunction with

                ETAPS 2004 (7th European Joint Conferences on Theory
                Theory and Practice of Software, March 27- April 4,2004)
                http://www.lsi.upc.es/etaps04/


AIMS AND SCOPE

During the last few years, it is becoming increasingly clear that a
great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition systems,
automata, process calculi and class-based systems can be captured uniformly
as  coalgebras. Coalgebra is developing into a field of its own interest
presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a growing field of applications
and interactions with various other fields such as reactive and interactive
system theory, object oriented and concurrent programming, formal system
specification, modal logic, dynamical systems, control systems, category
theory, algebra, analysis, etc. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras and its
applications.

 The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
   - the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
     approaches);
   - coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
     languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
   - coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
   - coalgebras and data types;
   - (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
     bisimulations or invariants);
   - coalgebras and algebras;
   - coalgebraic specification and verification;
   - coalgebras and (modal) logic;
   - coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid
      systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in Lisbon,
Amsterdam, Berlin, Genova, Grenoble, and Warsaw. The proceedings appeared as
"Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS)", Volumes 11,
19, 33, 41, 65.1 and 82.1. Selected papers have been/are being published in
Theoretical Computer Science, Theoretical Informatics and
Applications, and Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.

You can get an idea of the types of papers presented at previous meetings
by looking at the tables of content of the above ENTCS volumes from these
meetings. They are available via the ENTCS page

SUBMISSIONS

Submissions will be evaluated by the Program Committee for inclusion
in  the proceedings, which will be published in the ENTCS series. Papers must
contain original contribution, be clearly written, and include  appropriate
reference to and comparison with related work. Papers (of at  most 15 pages)
should be submitted electronically as PostScript files at the address
    J.Adamek@tu-bs.de.
A separate message should also be sent, with a text-only
one-page abstract and with mailing addresses (both postal and
electronic), telephone number and fax number of the corresponding author.
