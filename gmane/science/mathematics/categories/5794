I agree, it does sound like that, but there is at least a long
tradition of such names in mathematics (not that that makes
them a good thing).

One reason I like "autonomous" to mean a symmetric monoidal category
in which all objects have duals is that the only alternative names I
have heard for such a thing convey misleading intuition to me.  They
are sometimes called "compact closed" or (I think) "rigid" monoidal
categories, but "compact" and "rigid" are words with definite and
inapplicable intuitive meanings for me.  Compact means small, finite,
bounded, inaccessible by directed joins, etc. and "rigid" means "having few
automorphisms," and I don't see that there is anything very compact or
rigid about such categories.  The only relationship I can think of is that a
compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed, and a symmetric monoidal
category with duals for objects is also automatically closed, but of course
these two meanings of "closed" are totally different.  Perhaps someone
can enlighten me?
