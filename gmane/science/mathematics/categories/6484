The answer is trivial: The category of Boolean rings without 1 (which means
"possibly without 1" of course) is equivalent to BA/2, which, by Stone
duality, is dually equivalent to the category of pointed Stone spaces.

However thinking of "partial maps" was not too bad since, say, the category
of pointed sets is equivalent to the category of sets with partial maps as
morphisms.
