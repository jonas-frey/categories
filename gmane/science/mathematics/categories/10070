Perhaps this is one of the accounts you found unsatisfactory, but what
about the approach using indexed categories, as set out in e.g. Section
B1.3 of the Elephant, and (partially) summarised at
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/indexed+category ?

Your category C would be given as an indexed category over the base E; this
allows talking about families of objects of C indexed by objects of E, and
more generally, diagrams in E indexed by internal categories in C.  There
are standard definitions (given in the Elephant) for an indexed category to
*locally small* (generalising the enrichment you ask for), and
*well-powered*, which seems sufficient for all or most of what you ask for
below?

(Of course, all this can be set up in terms of fibrations instead of
indexed categories, according to taste.)

Best,
