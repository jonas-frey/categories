Dear Steve,

I have nothing to say about your Stone spaces question in general, except f=
or your remarks in the second part of your message about the symmetric mona=
d M, where you suggest that the Stone locale view of connected components w=
ould perhaps cast light on the missing construction of a topos version N of=
  the upper power locale P_U, just as the symmetric monad M is a topos versi=
on of the lower power locale P_L.

In my paper =93Pitts monads and a lax descent theorem=94 (2015), (Remark 7.=
6), I leave it as an open question (more or less) the construction of such =
an N. [ The name =93Pitts monad=94 I gave on account on a condition which f=
irst appears in a theorem of A.M. Pitts whereby, in a lax pullback with bot=
tom map an S-essential geometric morphisms, the top map is locally connecte=
d. The S-essential geometric morphisms are precisely the M-maps, and for th=
e lower power locale monad P_L, the P_L-maps are the open maps. ]

However, toposes are more complicated than locales and a perfect analogue m=
ay not be what one should seek Indeed, one can view the symmetric monad M (=
classifier of distributions on toposes X,  or equivalently of complete spre=
ads over X with a locally connected domain) as a topos version of the lower=
  power locale  P_L. There is however another such candidate, which is the b=
agdomain monad B_L (classifier of bags of points, or equivalently of branch=
ed coverings over X,  namely of those complete spreads that are purely loca=
lly equivalent to a locally constant cover). See M. Bunge and J. Funk, Sing=
ular Coverings of Toposes (2006), (Def. 9.32). In the same source SCT ( 8.3=
) there is a diagram which shows that there are two factorizations of the u=
nit X=97> M(X), namely one through the unit X=97> B_L(X) and the other thro=
ugh the unit X=97> T(X) where T (classifier of probability distributions, t=
hat is of distributions on X which preserve the terminal object, equivalent=
ly of complete spreads over X whose domains are locally connected and have =
totally connected components, the latter meaning that the connected compone=
nts functor preserves pullbacks). In particular, M(X) is equivalent to B_L(=
T(X)).

It is therefore of interest (to me at least) to find, not just the N that I=
  mentioned above, but also a monad B_U, as both would presumably be topos v=
ersions of the upper power locale monad P_U. In addition, it is of interest=
  (to me at least) to find versions of a "single universe=94, by which I mea=
n an analogue to the double power locale monad P, which as you and C. Towns=
end have shown, is such that P(X) for X a locale, can be viewed either as a=
  composite in either direction of P_L and P_U applied to X,  or  as equival=
ent to the double exponentiation O^O^X (even if X not necessarily exponenti=
able) where O is the Sierpinski locael.

For O =3D the objects classifier in Top_S, the double exponential is in fac=
t relevant already in my first (Algebra Universalis 1995) paper where I con=
struct the symmetric topos by forcing methods, in that distributions on X c=
an be seen as carved out of O^O^X (suitably interpreted via points). Simila=
rly, an =93upper=94 version N of  M can be constructed as the classifier N =
of local homomorphisms over toposes. The question then in my view is now ho=
w to deal with the =93upper=94 version B_U of B_L. The analogues semiopen-o=
pen versus perfect-proper (or tidy-relatively tidy) are of course relevant =
to this and constitutes work in progress.

Best regards,
Marta

Subject: categories: Topos theory for spaces of connected components

Topos theory gives a solid account of local connectedness, where each open =
-  indeed, each sheaf - has a set (discrete space) of connected components.=
  The definition of locally connected geometric morphism covers not only ind=
ividual spaces but also bundles, considered fibrewise. It also covers gener=
alized spaces as well as ungeneralized.

Is there an analogous theory for where the space of connected components is=
  Stone? ("Connected" is now defined by orthogonality with respect to Stone =
spaces instead of discrete spaces.)

The obvious example is any Stone space X, for instance, Cantor space, where=
  X  is its own space of connected components. We get Stone spaces of connec=
ted components more generally for any compact regular space - take the Ston=
e space corresponding to the Boolean algebra of clopens. People tend not to=
  notice  the Stone space aspects in the usual examples based on real analys=
is, since  they are also locally connected. Being a Stone space then just m=
akes the set of connected components finite with decidable equality. For an=
y compact regular space, we find that each closed subspace has a Stone spac=
e of connected components.

(By the way, if you wonder what brought me to this, it was from pondering t=
he symmetric monad M on Grothendieck toposes. Bunge and Funk proved that fo=
r ungeneralized spaces its localic reflection is the lower powerlocale, whi=
ch raises the question of whether there is a missing topos construction who=
se localic reflection is the upper powerlocale. On the other hand, the symm=
etric monad is related to local connectedness. Points of MX are cosheaves o=
n X, and  X is locally connected if there is a terminal cosheaf in a strong=
  sense, with that cosheaf providing the sets of connected components. Perha=
ps understanding the Stone space view of connected components would cast li=
ght on this missing construction.)

All the best,

Steve.
