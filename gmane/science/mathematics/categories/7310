Concerning Borceaux's citation of "Revised and reduced..." in the second=20
edition of Bourbaki, Theorie des Ensembles, chapitre IV, I think a more=20
accurate translation is "suppressed", rather than "reduced".  What was=20
suppressed from the first, 1957, edition of Structures was the 19 page=20
appendix, titled Criteres de transportabilite, and  devoted to giving=20
useful criteria for verifying that a relation of a theory T, is=20
transportable relative to a given typification, as these terms are=20
defined in =B6 1 of this chapter.  Thus, this appendix   also explains th=
e=20
concept of "transport of structure", a notion that Bourbaki employed=20
frequently and also gives a rigorous definition of "canonical".=20

It seems plausible that Chevalley was the author of this appendix,=20
although Bourbaki tradition is to not confirm or deny such a statement.

I have never understood why Bourbaki chose to suppress this appendix, as=20
I find it very interesting  and very well written.
