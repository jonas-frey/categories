I beg to differ - a little

so far so good

a math proof is hardly necessary to explain a scientific subject in a
usable way.

now for a mathematical subject a math proof is sometimes but not always
necessary

Not all of us

and notice you are talking about the NOTICES
not the Bulletin

developing a mathematical thought,

depends what you mean by that
developing in the sense of enough to be active in the field - of course not

developing a sense of what the thought of the experts are so that one
might want to learn more or NOT
or
might see relevance to ones own disparate research - they work fine

Examples ? I certinaly have not seen such
In fact as an editor and referee and all the referees I've used
have never tolerated such elimination.  in fact, due to cross
fertilization, even some physics papers now have defintions

Me thinks thou doth protest too much
