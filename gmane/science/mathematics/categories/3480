The math advisers from CalTech had a little fun on Friday's episode of
"Numb3rs". The Mathematician and the Physicist are looking at a dead
person's notebook. They're dead serious.

  MATHEMATICIAN: it's a category-based approach to I don't know what,
  but it's a forcasting system. Right?. It's very sophisticated.

  PHYSICIST: [In awe at what he sees] Oh, no, no. no. This is more
  than sophisticated. You know what this reminds me of?  A topos
  approach to Bach's music.

  MATHEMATICIAN: I said: very sophisticated.

  FBI AGENT: Yes -- you did.

Be assured that neither the page we see from the notebook nor the
rest of the program had anything to do with categories, topoi or Bach.
