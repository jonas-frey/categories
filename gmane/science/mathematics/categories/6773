Dear Mike=2C

As for stacks being the primary motivation Makkai had for anafunctors=2C th=
at is not the impression I got from people attending his course=2C as they =
not only expressed interest in this comment of mine=2C but also someone sug=
gested reducing the theory of stacks to that of anafunctors. In fact=2C I w=
as told by another that the introduction of anafunctors was quite different=
  from that of stacks=2C as it had more to do with expressing anafunctors in=
  FOLDS. Since you are interested in this=2C why don't you try getting it di=
rectly from the horse's mouth?=A0

The answer to your other question (Are there any interesting non-Grothendie=
ck elementary toposes whichare known to satisfy the axiom of stack completi=
ons?)=A0is still open. Bob Pare and I investigated this question a long tim=
e ago (more than 30 years ago=2C actually) and in our attempts to formulate=
  this axiom=2C all we could say was that every Grothedieck topos satisfied =
it. I forgot to mention that an elementary formulation of ASC ("axiom of st=
ack completions") is till missing. All I mean by it at the moment is that i=
t holds for an elementary topos S if=2C for any category C in S=2C the stac=
k completion \tilde([C]) of the fibration [C] over S which is the externali=
zation of C=2C which is explicilty constructed=2C is equivalent to the exte=
rnalization [\tilde(C)] of a category \tilde(C) in S.=A0

Regards=2CMarta=A0
