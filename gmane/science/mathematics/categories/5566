Description:
This event has as its goal to bring together researchers working on
mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing and
spatio-temporal causal structures, and in particular those that use
logical tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal
languages, semantical methods and other computer science methods for the
study physical behaviour in general. Over the past couple of years there
has been a growing activity in these foundational approaches together with
a renewed interest in the foundations of quantum theory, which complement
the more mainstream research in quantum computation. A predecessor of this
event, with the same acronym, called Quantum Programming Languages, was
held in Ottawa (2003), Turku (2004), Chicago (2005) and Oxford (2006). The
first QPL under the new name Quantum Physics and Logic was held in
Reykjavik (2008) and the second in Oxford (2009); with the change of name
and a new program committee we emphasise the intended much broader scope
of this event, aiming to nourish interaction between modern computer
science logic, quantum computation and information, models of
spatio-temporal causality, and quantum foundations.

Submission:
Prospective speakers are invited to submit a 2-5 pages abstract which
provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest and provides
sufficient detail to allows the program committee to assess the merits of
the work. Submissions of works in progress are encouraged but must be more
substantial than a research proposal. We both encourage submissions of
original research as well as research submitted elsewhere. Submissions
should be in Postscript or PDF format and should be sent to Bob Coecke by
March 28, with as subject line QPL Submission. Receipt of all submissions
will be acknowledged by return email. Extended versions of accepted
original research contributions will be published as a special issue of a
jounal - we are currently still exploring the options.
