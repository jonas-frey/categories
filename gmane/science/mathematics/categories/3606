Dear Max,

I feel deeply sad that you have left.
Now that you are gone, I realise how much you mean to me.
I regret not telling you that.
I wish to repair that by writing you this letter.
If I send it to Imogen and to your friends,
it will reach you in some way.

Your work has been a constant source of inspiration for me.
It combines beauty, rigor and depth.
It is fundamental, I use it every day.
It will last forever.
You were a great mathematician.

I also want to thank you for inviting me to Australia.
I did some of my best work there.
You were a great host.
I made many friends.

I wish we could meet again.
I will talk with you in my dreams.

Yours, Andre
