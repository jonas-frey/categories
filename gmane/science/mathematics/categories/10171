In view of the chaotic situation in many places of the world due to the
pandemic, we are sorry to inform you that we definitely will not be able to
maintain the physical event of the MFPS and QPL 2020 conferences in Paris or,
indeed, anywhere else in the world.

We are still working out the details of how to hold a virtual meeting. At a
minimum, we plan to offer the opportunity to upload pre-recorded lectures to an
online conference platform. More information on the concrete modalities
(offline videos, forum, online discussion platform, etc) will be forthcoming.

Conference proceedings of the accepted papers will still be published as usual.

The final Call for Papers for MFPS is repeated below. Submission deadlines
remain unchanged.

Best wishes,
Patricia Johann, on behalf of the MFPS and QPL PC chairs

======================================================================


The 36th Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming
Semantics (MFPS 2020) takes place at University of Paris Saclay,
France, June 2???6, 2020.

MFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and
computer science that are related to models of computation in general,
and to semantics of programming languages in particular. This is a
forum where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet
and exchange ideas. The participation of researchers in neighbouring
areas is strongly encouraged.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
bio-computation; concurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed
systems; process calculi; probabilistic systems; constructive
mathematics; domain theory and categorical models; formal languages;
formal methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; programming-language
theory; quantum computation; security; topological models; logic; type
systems; type theory. We also welcome contributions that address
applications of semantics to novel areas such as complex systems,
markets, and networks, for example.
