Call for contributions.

	        Workshop on
            MODAL FIXPOINT LOGICS
     http://staff.science.uva.nl/~yde/mfl

to be held at the Institute of Logic, Language, and Computation,
Amsterdam,  March 25-27 2008.

Modal fixpoint logics constitute a research field of considerable
interest, not only because of their many applications, but also
because of their rich logical/mathematical theory. Systems such as
LTL, PDL, CTL, and the modal mu-calculus, originate from computer
science, and are for instance applied in the theory of program
specification and verification. The richness of their theory stems
from the deep connections with various fields in logic, mathematics,
and theoretical computer science, such as lattices and universal
(co-)algebra, modal logic, automata, and game theory.

Large areas of the theory of modal fixpoint logics, in particular the
connection with the theory of automata and games, have been
intensively investigated and are by now are well
understood. Nevertheless, there are still many aspects that are less
explored. This applies in particular to the model theory, intended as
the study of a logic as a function of classes of models, the proof
theory, the algebraic logic, duality theory in the spirit of
Stone/Priestly duality, and the relation to the theory of ordered sets
as grounding the concept of "least fixpoint".

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers from various
backgrounds, in particular, computer scientists and pure logicians,
who share an interest in the area. The invited talks together will
represent an overview of the richness of the theory of modal fixpoint
logics.

While most of the available time will be devoted to the invited talks,
there will be some opportunity for contributed talks as well. We
invite contributed talks on all aspects of fixpoint logics, including
their proof theory, model theory, algebraic aspects, connections with
automata and games, and algorithmic issues. However, talks that focus
on the logical theory of modal fixpoint logics will be given
preference.

Researchers interested in giving a contributed talk should send by
February 1, 2008 a short abstract (one page at most, in pdf format)
describing the content of their contribution to Luigi Santocanale
(luigi.santocanale@lif.univ-mrs.fr). Acceptance of presentations
will be notified by February 11, 2008.

Important dates:
       1/02/2008  Submission of abstracts
      11/02/2008  Notification of acceptance
   25-27/03/2008  Workshop
