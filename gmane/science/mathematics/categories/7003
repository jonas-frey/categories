The discussion is going in circles, it should have occurred over
several rounds of beer. Anyhow, what Steve is pointing out that you
must not forget the typing context, as any categorical logician will
tell you. Let me write

  a:A | .....

to indicate that stuff is hapenning in the context in which a is a
free variable of type A. Then what we have above is the instance of
Modus Ponens rule:

a:A | TRUE(a)                       a:A | TRUE(a) -> exists x:A, TRUE(x)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----------------------
                       a:A | exists x:A, TRUE(x)

Thus, the conclusion is _not_

   | exists x:A, TRUE(x)

but rather

   a:A | exists x:A, TRUE(x)

and that's an important difference. Out of curiosity I tested Coq to
see what it would do:

-----
Parameter A : Set.
Parameter P : U -> Prop.

Theorem vaughn:
   (forall a : A, P a) -> exists x : A, P x.
Proof.
   firstorder.
-----

Coq answered with the following:

-----
1 subgoal

   H : forall a : A, P a
   =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D
    A
-----

Coq is telling me that in order to finish the proof, I must provide an
element of A. Just as it should. Of course, the same theorem in the
context a : A goes through:

-----
Theorem steve (a : A):
   (forall a : A, P a) -> exists x : A, P x.
Proof.
   firstorder.
Qed.
-----

Now coq says "proof completed".

With kind regards,

Andrej
