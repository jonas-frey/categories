Call for participation.

	        Workshop on
            MODAL FIXPOINT LOGICS
         Amsterdam, March 25-27 2008
     http://staff.science.uva.nl/~yde/mfl

Registration deadline: March 19, 2008

Modal fixpoint logics constitute a research field of considerable
interest, not only because of their many applications, but also
because of their rich logical/mathematical theory. Systems such as
LTL, PDL, CTL, and the modal mu-calculus, originate from computer
science, and are for instance applied in the theory of program
specification and verification. The richness of their theory stems
from the deep connections with various fields in logic, mathematics,
and theoretical computer science, such as lattices and universal
(co-)algebra, modal logic, automata, and game theory.

Large areas of the theory of modal fixpoint logics, in particular the
connection with the theory of automata and games, have been intensively
investigated and are by now are well understood. Nevertheless, there
are still many aspects that are less explored. This applies in particular
to the model theory, intended as the study of a logic as a function of
classes of models, the proof theory, the algebraic logic, duality theory
in the spirit of Stone/Priestly duality, and the relation to the theory
of ordered sets as grounding the concept of "least fixpoint".

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers from various
backgrounds, in particular, computer scientists and pure logicians,
who share an interest in the area.
