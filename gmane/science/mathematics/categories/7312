The proposition that "mathematical structure is given by data and
conditions" is so broad as to be vacuous from a foundational standpoint.
   While there may be disagreement between mathematical camps over
whether algebraic frameworks rest on logical or vice versa, common to
both is the idea that one starts with a (non-logical) language and
equips it with a theory.  I don't see how "data and conditions" can be
interpreted as giving undue weight to either the equational or
first-order starting points.    The sentiment could just as validly
preface a graduate course on first order model theory.
