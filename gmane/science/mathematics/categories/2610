                        3rd CALL FOR PAPERS

10th conference on Category Theory and Computer Science (CTCS'04)

                        August 12-14, 2004

                 IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark
                 www.itu.dk/research/theory/ctcs2004/

             Submission Deadline: April 9th, 2004

-----------------------------------------------------------------

                          Invited Speakers:

                      Francois Bergeron   (Quebec)
                      Martin Hyland    (Cambridge)
                      Robin Milner     (Cambridge)
                      Andrew Pitts     (Cambridge)
                      Thomas Streicher (Darmstadt)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of the CTCS conference series is the advancement of the
foundations of computing using the tools of category theory.  Previous
meetings have been held in Guildford (Surrey), Edinburgh (twice),
Manchester, Paris, Amsterdam, Cambridge, S. Margherita Ligure
(Genova), and Ottawa.

The emphasis is upon applications of category theory, but it is
recognized that the area is highly interdisciplinary. Typical topics
of interest include, but are not limited to, category-theoretic
aspects of the following:

* Coalgebras and computing
* Concurrent and distributed systems
* Constructive mathematics
* Declarative programming and term rewriting
* Domain theory and topology
* Foundations of computer security
* Linear logic
* Modal and temporal logics
* Models of computation
* Program logics, data refinement, and specification
* Programming language semantics
* Type theory

The proceedings of the conference will be published as a special issue
of ENTCS (Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

                            Associated events:


FIRST GRADUATE STUDENT SUMMER SCHOOL, August 9-11.

Inspired by the success of the graduate student preconference of
CTCS'02 in Ottawa, the CTCS of this year will have a graduate student
summer school from August 9-11, sponsored by the FIRST graduate school
(www.first.dk).  The goal is to prepare students (with basic knowledge
of category theory) for CTCS, through mini-courses in the basic areas
underlying some of the fields of the conference. The school will offer
the following mini-courses (5 lectures each):

    * Coalgebras, Modal Logic and Stone Duality (Lecturer: Alexander Kurz)
    * Game Semantics (Lecturer: Guy McCusker)
    * Operational Semantics (Lecturer: Pawel Sobocinski)
    * Categorical Models for Concurrency (Lecturer: Thomas Hildebrandt)

Registration Deadline: July 1st.


CMCIM WORKSHOP, August 11.

In between the summer school and the CTCS conference, August 11th,
there will be a half-day workshop on Categorical Methods in
Concurrency, Interaction and Mobility. The workshop has previously
been held in connection with CONCUR 2002 and CONCUR 2003.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts (less than 5 pages),
presenting recent results, challenges or work in progress. There will
be no formal proceedings of the workshop, informal proceedings will be
distributed at the workshop. Thus, accepted material may be published
elsewhere at a later date.

Workshop participation is *free*, but requires registration.

Registration is done by sending an email to hilde@itu.dk, containing
`CMCIM2004-registration' in the subject, and your full name and
institution in the body.

Submissions should be sent as PostScript files to: hilde@itu.dk,
containing `CMCIM-submission' in the subject, and in the body the full
names of the author(s), title, and a text-only abstract.

Workshop Organizers:

  Thomas Hildebrandt
  Alexander Kurz


CMCIM Workshop Registration Deadline: July 1st.
CMCIM Workshop Submission Deadline: June 21th.

STUDENT GRANTS  (application deadline: April 1st!!)

A limited number of grants is available for funding the stay of
international students at a nearby youth hostel during the summer
school and conference.
