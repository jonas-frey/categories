At the Institute of Theoretical Computer Science of the Gauss Faculty of
the Technical University of Braunschweig a position is available
from August 2007. Candidates must have an outstanding undergraduate degree
(German Diploma, Master or equivalent) in computer science with a strong
theoretical background, or a degree in mathematics. The successful
candidate is expected to combine research in the field of

         algebraic and coalgebraic methods in computer science

with teaching (about 4 hours a week) which is expected to be held in
German.
The position will initially be filled for two years and can be extended
for up to six years. The salary ranges between EUR 2800 and 4100 per month
