I love the nLab too, but I'm not sure that "merging" is the right
word; probably the two are serving slightly different purposes.  The
overall nLab is not really organized like a textbook or designed to be
read linearly; writing a textbook requires additional thought.  But
there is certainly no reason why the two can't share material and link
to each other as appropriate.  And/or one could choose to write a
textbook as a section of the nLab rather than on Wikibooks (if, for
instance, one preferred its offerings in the way of mathematical
typesetting).
