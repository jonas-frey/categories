I always have present that Grothendieck himself explicitly discarded his
notion of "cat?gorie cliv?e" (ie indexed category) introduced in the
S?minaire Bourbaki (1959) in favor of his notion of "cat?gorie fibr?e"
introduced in SGA1 (1961) (see SLN Vol 224 remark page 193).

I would like to make a few comments, in particular about Steve Vickers' mail, since all the other participants to the discussion seemed to accept his approach.

Vickers uses two duals of the 2-category C where the fibration lives. However if C has comma objects and 2-pullbacks, there is no reason why these duals have the same properties. Moreover, even in Cat, Vickers' approach will work only for bifibrations which have both a cleavage and a co-cleavage.
