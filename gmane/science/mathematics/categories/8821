Call for abstracts for the NASSLLI workshop on Statistical and Logical Mode=
=3D
ls of Meaning (SaLMoM)


Date and Location:

July 11-15 2016, Rutgers University, New Jersey, US.



We invite submissions in the form of 2-page abstracts on topics relating st=
=3D
atistical and logical models of natural language. This can be a summary of =
=3D
an already published paper or a new contribution.


On the statistical side, we welcome, for example, submissions on distributi=
=3D
onal and probabilistic semantics and vector space models of meaning. In thi=
=3D
s relation we encourage work that goes beyond subject-verb-object construct=
=3D
ions and addresses logical and functional words such as coordinators, quant=
=3D
ifiers, and prepositions.


On the logical side, we invite work on type-logical approaches such as mult=
=3D
imodal extensions of categorial grammars in the logical and

combinatorial traditions; calculi of discontinuity combining Concatenation =
=3D
and wrapping operations; hybrid type-logical grammars mixing Directional an=
=3D
d non-directional modes; and continuation-based semantic approaches.


Submissions will be evaluated as to their potential for establishing meanin=
=3D
gful links between the logical and statistical approaches.
