Dear all,

I cannot type any form of LaTeX, and do not know the "standard" ways to =
introduce indices,exponentials and so on, using only the typing which is =
admitted on this list. Thus I shall use "non standard" notations, very =
simple, which I shall explain precisely.
If A is a category an object a of A can be identified with a functor =
"name of a" which I denote by "a": 1 --> A .
If  F: A --> C and G: B --> C are functors I denote by  F/G the comma =
category they define, and by F//G their
  2-pull-back sometimes called their pseudo pull-back.
I shall call "weak equivalence" a functor F: A --> B  full and faithful =
and essentially surjective (ff-es) and say that A is weakly equivalent =
(we) to B if there is such an F. This defines  a preorder relation which =
I denote by=20
W(A,B). It is symmetric iff the Axiom of choice (AC) holds.
A strong equivalence between  A and B is a pair of adjoint functors  F: =
A --> B  and  F': B --> A  such that the adjunction morphisms are isos. =
I shall say that  A and B are strongly equivalent if such a pair exists =
and denote by  SE(A,B) this equivalence relation.
If S is a category I denote by Fib/S the 2-category of fibrations over S
I denote by S=B0 the dual of S . An S indexed category C is a pseudo =
functor   C: S=B0 --> Cat .  For each map =20
f: s --> t  of  S , I denote by f*: C(t) --> C(s) the value of  C on f. =
If g: t --> u is another map of S, I denote by  c(f,g) the isomorphism =
f*g* --> (gf)*. I shall assume C normalized i.e. for each object  s of =
S, id(s)* =3D id(C(s))
For an indexed functor  F: C --> C'  i use the following notations: If s =
is an object of S, F(s): C(s) --> C'(s) ,=20
if  f: s --> t is a map of S  is the iso of functors  F(s)f* --> f*F(t)
(I'm aware of the ambiguity of denoting by the same  f* the "re-indexing =
functors" defined by C and C' but it is the best I can do with the =
limited typographic means I use, without having too cumbersome =
notations)=20
If S is has pull-backs, I denote by Cat(S) the category of categories =
internal to S

Answer to Toby Bartels:
(i) You propose to compose the spans by pullbacks. Here is an example of =
two spans  A <-- X --> B and=20
B <-- Y --> C such that the functors  A <--X  and  Y --> C are isos, the =
functors X --> B and  B <-- Y have unique quasi inverses, and if  Z is =
the pullback none of the functors  A <-- Z  and  Z --> B is a weak =
equivalence:
Take A=3DX=3DY=3DC=3D1, take for B the coarse category with two objects  =
a and b  , for X --> B and  B <-- Y  the functors  "a": 1 --> B  and  B =
<-- 1: "b"  . The pullback  Z is 0=20
How stronger a counter example do you need? And using zig-zags will make =
the situation even worse.
(ii) you define equivalences by spans, not "up to anything". With this =
definition an equivalence between 1 and 1 is any non empty coarse =
category. Every non empty set determines up to isomorphism such a =
category. thus there are at least as many equivalences from 1 to 1 in =
your sense as there are non empty sets. A bit much don't you think?

Answer to David Roberts. I quote you:
"Also, for the purposes of further discussion, the terminology "evil" =
has been demoted to a mere footnote at the nLab, as it was probably =
always meant to be by its coiners, and replaced by the morally neutral =
and more informative name 'principle of equivalence'. Interestingly, =
Voevodsky's Univalence Axiom is a way of ensuring the principle is =
always respected (and without awkward acrobatics)."

I am a very thorough person, so I have looked at the instances of "evil" =
in nLab and found hundreds of them, not mere footnotes.
I shall concentrate on the article: "Grothendieck fibrations in nLab". =
It has been revised by Mike Shulman on october 11, 2012, i.e. not very =
long ago, and it has many interesting features. I shall comment only =
those of them which have some bearings to the present discussion.
Although it is supposed to deal with Grothendieck's fibrations there is =
a long paragraph,almost a whole page, with the title: "Non evil =
version". The very first line is: "There is something evil about the =
notion of fibration.." and the word "evil" is even underlined.
Another interesting feature is the definition of internal fibration in a =
strict 2-category K (why "strict"? a 2-category is a 2-category. =
Probably because the notion of 2-category is unbearably evil).
If you use this definition for K =3D Cat, it is easy to see that such =
internal fibrations are Grothendieck fibrations equipped with a =
cleavage. The situation is even worse if K =3D Cat(S)=20
Last but not least, I recommend reading the deep discussion between =
Shridar Ramesh and Mike Shulman about "indexing" the fibration  Z --> =
Z/2Z. (but hurry, because after this mail there might very well be a =
quick revision of the article).
I happen to like very much Grothendieck's fibrations, this would =
probably qualify me as an evil person, let me say that i'm proud of this =
kind of evilness. =20

Preliminary answer to Marta Bunge:
Many thanks for your mail. Before I give a complete answer, I have some =
questions:
(1) - What do you mean precisely by a full, faithful essentially =
surjective indexed functor. Does this notion depend on the =
indexings?(this is why I took the pain to give precise notations for =
such indexed functors)
(2) - I suppose that if C is internal to S, your [C] is the canonical =
(split) indexing defined by [C](s) =3D S(s,C)  thus your answer to (1) =
will tell me what you mean by [C] and [D] are weakly equivalent.

Before getting your answers, I can already make a few comments about =
your mail.
(a) Assuming you have a notion of equivalence E(A,B) reflexive =
transitive and symmetric, your answer to (ii) is a bit surprising. Given =
any A, suppose someone asks how many B's are equivalent to A? If B and =
B' are such B's, they are equivalent, hence if you work up to =
equivalence, the answer is 1. What do stack completions have to do with =
this answer?=20
(b) You say that you could have worked with fibered categories instead =
of indexed ones, and I believe you.
But why didn't you do it? What is at stake in this this discussion is =
the equivalence of categories with or without AC. You know that the =
relation between indexed categories and fibered ones depends essentially =
on AC.
I have seen very strange things about this relation.
The strangest one can be found in the Elephant: p.4, one can read:
"we  should make the smallest possible demands on the metatheory within =
which we interpret the theory of categories (and in particular we shall =
not assume that it satisfies any form of the axiom of choice)"
True to this very strong statement, the author gives the proof, due to =
Grothendiek, that indexed categories are "the same thing" as fibered =
categories equipped with a cleavage. And that is O.K. for me.
But then, without any transition or warning he starts saying:
"Let  P: C --> S be a fibration and CC be the associated indexed =
category .."
It is not an accidental slip. It can be found in Example 1.3.13, Lemma =
1.4.1, Lemma 1.4.5, Lemma 1.4.9, Lemma 1.4.10, Lemma 1.4.11, Theorem =
1.4.12, etc..
He does not say "an" associated, but " the" associated. This means not =
only that every fibration has a cleavage (which is equivalent to AC when =
restricted to small fibrations) but also comes equipped with a cleavage, =
which is equivalent to huge form of AC for classes. Not bad considering =
the strong statement I have quoted.
But even assuming this huge AC, "the" associated indexed category is =
astounding.
It well known, and was remarked by Grothendieck more than 50 years ago, =
that a group homomorphism=20
P: E --> B is a fibration iff it is surjective, and that a cleavage is a =
section S of (the underlying map of) P.
You won't find this fact in the Elephant. "The" associated indexed =
category means that such a P comes equipped with a section.
Imagine the reaction of the students if, in order to explain periodic =
functions via the surjection P: R --> R/Z , you had to assume that a =
section S of P is already given, and that S has any influence on the =
notion of periodic function!
I believe that indexed categories have been a disaster for the =
mathematicians, some of whom very serious, who have adopted them.
Let me give two more arguments.
(a) They forbid the study of functors P: E --> B more general than =
fibrations, but which keep enough of the features of the fibrations to =
be able to prove about them many of the results of fibered category =
theory. The simplest case is pre-fibrations.
(b) The theory of fibrations is a first order theory, therefore they can =
be internalized, e.g. in a topos (this is much too strong) Can anybody =
give a definition of internal indexed categories and functors?To

Excuse me for such a long mail, there are many more things to say about =
equivalences of categories, but they will have to be postponed to =
another mail.
