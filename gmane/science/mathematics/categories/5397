I would add something between 2 and 3 about Triples (allright,=20
monads) and Equational theories.

Here is an example of the sort of thing we are up against.  A colleague=20
called me this morning because a student had taken a set of notes (in=20
French) on his course and was interested in publishing it.  My colleague=20
had an objection because in describing conformal isomorphism from the=20
complex plane (or maybe sphere) to itself, the student had used the word=20
"towards" (vers) instead of "on".  His objection was that a conformal=20
isomorphism was something between two spaces, not from one to the other.=20
My answer was a specific such map was a map from one to the other.  His=20
reply essentially was, "Oh, it's category theory language.  Well, I won't=
=20
allow any of that in MY notes. No analyst would use that language."
