Fellow categorists,

Jim Stasheff has been appealing to me to comment on the role of=20
category theory in knot theory in the context of the =91cracks and pots=92=
=20
thread.

In that regard, let me begin with the story I tell in the introduction=20=

to my book:

At a Joint Summer Research conference a number of years back, Moishe=20
Flato at some point offered the usual dismissal of category theory--=91it=20=

is a mere language=92.  Kolya Reshetikhin and I undertook that evening =
to=20
disabuse him of the notion by explaining Shum=92s coherence theorem (the=20=

one-object version, being =91the braided monoidal category with =
two-sided=20
duals compatible with the braiding is monoidally equivalent to the=20
category of framed tangles=92).  This is a remarkable theorem--a=20
structure absolutely natural from the internal structure of category=20
theory is essentially identical to the key geometric sturctures in 3-=20
and 4-manifold topology, framed tangles being simply =91relative =
versions=20
of=92 the framed links on which the Kirby calculi for 3- and 4-manifolds=20=

depend.  It is one of several theorems relating category theory, and=20
with it  a great deal of algebra, to geometric topology, all of which=20
had a =93who ordered that?=94 feel about them.  It is also the only =
basis=20
on which the connection between knot theory and quantum groups can be=20
explained:  the category of representations of a quantum group has the=20=

algebraic structure for which framed tangles are a free model!

I retired before the point had sunk in, leaving Kolya to continue the=20
discussion.  The next morning as I sat in the back of the main lecture=20=

hall, Flato came in, tapped me on the shoulder, and with a thumbs up,=20
said =93Hey! Viva les categories!. . .these new ones, the braided=20
monoidal ones.=94

Now, Shum=92s theorem is merely the first of several, all of which give=20=

one the =93who ordered that?=94 impression, at least once on starts=20
thinking of TQFT=92s.  The other two that come to mind require a bit of=20=

set up to state fully, but I will spare you all now:  they are Abrams=20
theorem that a 2-dimensional TQFT is equivalent to a Frobenius algebra,=20=

and a theorem due to myself and Crane, and Kerler, that in a certain=20
category of cobordisms between surfaces with boundary, the handle (a=20
torus with a hole cut in it) has the structure of a Hopf algebra (CY,=20
K) which is self-dual (CY) and admits a right integral (K), and that=20
every surface with a circle boundary is a Yetter-Drinfel=92d module over=20=

the handle.  (For an ordinary finite dimensional Hopf algebra,=20
YD-modules are modules over the Drinfel=92d double, but they exist more=20=

generally, for infinite dimensional Hopf algebras or Hopf algebra=20
objects in arbitrary monoidal categories, where Drinfel=92d doubles =
don=92t=20
exist.)

All of these are part and parcel of a different face of category theory=20=

than one saw in the old days:  category theory as algebra, rather than=20=

category theory as foundations.

Flato=92s dismissal was directed at category theory as foundations.  It=20=

is easily ignored if one is interested in foundations of mathematics,=20
since most mathematicians really don=92t care about foundations.  For=20
example, many mathematicians pay lip service to the attitude =91set=20
theory is =91the=92 foundation of mathematics=92, but then turn around =
and=20
talk about =91the real numbers=92.  Which =91real numbers=92?  Dedekind =
cuts? =20
equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences? a complete Archimedian field=20
constructed from surreal numbers?  Now we, as categorists, know the=20
question is silly:  one doesn=92t bother asking which of a family of=20
isomorphic structures one means, because they are isomorphic.  It is in=20=

the practical sense of describing the basic structure of what=20
mathematicians actually do, that category theory is a superior=20
=91foundation=92 to set theory.  (Was there ever a time when the epsilon=20=

tree defining an element of a smooth manifold ever mattered to anyone?)=20=

  The dim view of category theory in many mathematical circles is surely=20=

due to mathematicians=92 boredom with foundations--and attitude which=20
might be summed up as =93Set theory was bad enough.  Why open up all=20
those questions again? Just let me do my geometry, algebra, or=20
whatever.=94

I reading this thread, I wonder how much of the concern about public=20
perceptions of category theory is really concern that =91categories as=20=

algebra=92 has become the public face of category theory, concern on the=20=

part of those who are fond of =91categories as foundations=92.

=91Categories as foundations=92 served the subject poorly in relations =
to=20
most mathematicians, but well in relation to computer science:  only=20
categorists were willing to take up the challenge of polymorphic type=20
theory.  If you thought =91set theory is *the* foundation=92, you bashed=20=

your head against Russell=92s paradox and were no help the the folk in=20=

CS. We (really those of *you* who took up the challenge) were the only=20=

mathematicians who had any hope of being helpful.

On the other hand, those of us who set our sights on =91core =
mathematics=92=20
have been better served by =91categories as algebra=92:  the =
applications=20
to knot theory (and geometric topology more generally), homotopy=20
theory, deformation theory, and physics all flow from this =91face=92 of=20=

category theory.

Even if those of us whose love is =91categories as foundations=92 can be =
a=20
little uneasy with the other face of the subject getting applied to=20
physics and drawing fire from outside mathematics, those of us whose=20
love is =91categories as algebra=92 can be uneasy about applications of =
the=20
other face to philosophy (as pointed to in Peter Arndt=92s last post),=20=

which are sure to be vilified (philosophers and humanists always vilify=20=

their rivals, as I am learning from my daughter who is studying=20
philosophy).  =91Categories as algebra=92 at least got a =91Viva!=92 =
from one=20
of the fathers of deformation quantization.

railings like the one of Lubos Motl. Has anyone observed the same
phenomenon

or does it only exist among the people I have to do with?


All the best,
