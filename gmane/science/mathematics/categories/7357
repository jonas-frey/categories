I think there are two issues here: firstly the question of method,
and secondly the question of prohibitions and commands.

It's not clear at all that mathematics has a method in the same way
that other, more procedural, science (such as experimental psychology,
for example) have. The main problem here is that mathematics generally=20
proceeds by finding proofs, and, though there may be a method for
validating proofs (maybe, though I'm not sure about the semi-formal=20
proofs that you will find in maths journals) there is not really a
method for finding them.

It is true that you often find the phrase "mathematical method" in
the philosophical literature. This probably stems from seventeenth=20
century philosophy, when there certainly were attempts to find methods=20
for finding theorems, or for constructing solutions to equations. None=20
of these attempts really worked (Gaukroger's biography of Descartes is a=20
good introduction to this).

So I don't think that you are really asking about method, but about the=20
logical form of mathematical definitions, and whether they should=20
contain prohibitions as well as commands. It's an interesting=20
suggestion: you would probably have to formulate it intuitionistically=20
in order to get a difference between prohibitions and commands. There=20
might be some game-theoretic semantics which would help. Anybody else=20
know anything about this?
