Using "u" to stand for a non-unitary morphism!  Reminds me of the joke:

Teacher: Suppose p is a prime number...

Student: But what if it's not?

Teacher: Well then it wouldn't be called "p", now, would it!

Okay, that's a nice argument.  I'm pretty sure Lurie gave me some similar
argument: take a dagger-category, try to transport the structure along an
equivalence of categories, and get something unacceptable.

 If this is really true (and I think it is), we're pushed towards Mark
Weber's idea: dagger-categories are not best thought of as categories but
rather something new, based on graphs-with-involution instead of graphs.

Best,
