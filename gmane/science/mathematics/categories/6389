Dear Peter and Colin,

The result (and more general one asserting that if a variety V of
universal algebras has enough injectives then the  category of
V-algebras in a Grothendieck topos also has enough injectives) is
published in M.M. Ebrahimi, M. M., Algebra in a topos of sheaves:
Injectivity in quasi- equational classes, J. Pure and Appl. Alg., 26
(1982), 269=E2=80=93280. The different proof of the same result is given =
in
D.
Zangurashvili, Some categorical algebraic properties in quasi-varieties
of algebras in a Grothendieck topos, Bull. Acad. Sci. Georgian SSR,
139,
N1, 1990, 25-28. The second paper is mentioned in the Elephant.
Together
with the property to have enough injectives, the  amalgamation,
congruence extension, transferability properties and the property to
have enough absolute retracts in the categories of V- algebras in a
Grothendieck topos are studied in these papers.

Best regards,
Dali Zangurashvili
