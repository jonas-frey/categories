AiML-ICTL 2000
Advances in Modal Logic -
International Conference on Temporal Logic 2000

Deadline: May 15, 2000

AiML-ICTL 2000
In the year 2000, the Advances in Modal Logic workshop and the

Topics of interest include: common-sense temporal reasoning,
complexity of modal and temporal logics, deontic logic,
description logics, dynamic logic, epistemic logic, modal logics
of agency and space, modal logic and game theory, modal logic and
grammar formalisms, modal realism and anti-realism, modal and
temporal logic programming and theorem proving, model theory and
proof theory of modal and temporal logic, representation of time
in natural language semantics, non-monotonic modal logics,
provability logic, temporal databases.  Papers on related
subjects will also be considered.

SPECIAL SESSION
During the workshop there will be a special session on
description logics and applications of modal logic in Knowledge
Representation.
