From: Michael Makkai <makkai@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

A couple of days ago I announced the paper "On weak higher dimensional
categories" by C. Hermida, M. Makkai and J. Power. Now, I am announcing
some small changes of the arrangements concerning the electronic access to
the paper. 

The paper is available by anonymous ftp from triples.math.mcgill.ca in the
directory pub/makkai/multitopicsets [so, the change is that now the paper
is put into a subdirectory of pub/makkai]. There are ten files [there were
nine before; I have cut the largest into two].
