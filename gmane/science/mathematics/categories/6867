My preprint, with title
"Commutative monads as a theory of distributions",
and with the following abstract, has been posted on the arXiv,
http://arXiv.org/abs/1108.5952

"The theory of commutative monads on cartesian closed categories
provides a framework where aspects of the theory of distributions and
other extensive quantities can be formulated and some results proved. We
make explicit a link between our theory and the theory of Schwartz
distributions of compact support. We also discuss probability
distributions."

There is also a Section on physical distribution types, as torsors over
the corresponding pure quantity type.

This preprint subsumes and simplifies most of my two previous postings
on the arXiv, namely
"Monads and extensive quantities" (arXiv 1103.6009) and "Calculus of
extensive quantities" (arXiv 1105.3405).
