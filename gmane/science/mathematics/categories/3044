                      3rd International Workshop on
                     Web Services and Formal Methods
                              (WS-FM 2006)
                 8-9 September 2006, Vienna, Austria
                       http://cs.unibo.it/ws-fm06

             Official event of "The Process Modelling Group"
                 http://www.process-modelling-group.org

                        Co-located with BPM 2006
      4th International Conference on Business Process Management
                       http://bpm2006.tuwien.ac.at

SCOPE

  Web Services technology aims at providing standard mechanisms for
  describing the interface and the services available on the web, as well
  as protocols for locating such services and invoking them (e.g. WSDL,
  UDDI, SOAP). Innovations are mainly devoted to the definition of
  standards that support the specification of complex services out of
  simpler ones (the so called Web Service orchestration and
  choreography). Several proposals have been already set up: BPML, XLANG
  and BizTalk, WSFL, WS-BPEL, WS-CDL, etc...

  Formal methods, which provide formal machinery for representing and
  analysing the behavior of communicating concurrent/distributed systems,
  are playing a fundamental role in the development of such
  innovations. First of all they are exploited to understand the basic
  mechanisms (in terms of semantics) which characterize different
  orchestration and choreography languages and to focus on the essence
  of new features that are needed. Secondly they provide a formal
  basis for reasoning about Web Service semantics (behaviour and
  equivalence): e.g. for realizing registry services where retrieval
  is based on the meaning and behaviour of a service and not just a
  Web Service name. Thirdly, the studies on formal coordination paradigms
  can be exploited for developing mechanisms for complex run-time Web
  Service coordination. Finally, given the importance of critical
  application areas for Web Services like E-commerce, the development of
  the Web Service technology can certainly take advantage from formal
  analisys of security properties and performance in concurrency theory.

  The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers working on Web
  Services and Formal Methods in order to facilitate fruitful
  collaboration in this direction of research. This, potentially, could
  also have a great impact on the current standardization phase of Web
  Service technologies.

LIST OF TOPICS

  The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

    - Protocols and standards for WS (SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, etc... )
    - Languages and description methodologies for
      Coreography/Orchestration/Workflow
      (BPML, XLANG and BizTalk, WSFL, WS-BPEL, WS-CDL, YAWL, etc... )
    - Coordination techniques for WS
      (transactions, agreement, coordination services, etc...)
    - Semantics-based dynamic WS discovery services
      (based on Semantic Web/Ontology techniques or other semantic
      theories)
    - Security, Performance Evaluation and Quality of Service of WS
    - Semi-structured data and XML related technologies

SUBMISSIONS

  Submissions must be original and should not have been published
  previously or be under consideration for publication while being
  evaluated for this workshop.

  We encourage also the submission of tool papers, describing tools
  based on formal methods, to be exploited in the context of Web Services
  applications.

  Papers are to be prepared in LNCS format and must not exceed
  15 pages. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings
  as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

  As done for previous editions of the workshop, we intend to publish a
  journal special issue inviting full versions of papers selected among
  those presented at the workshop.
