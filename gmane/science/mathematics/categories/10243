CALL FOR ONLINE PARTICIPATION

ICGT 2020

13th International Conference on Graph Transformation
25-26 June 2020 as Online Conference
http://icgt2020.di.unipi.it <http://icgt2020.di.unipi.it/>

Part of STAF 2020
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**AIMS**

The use of graph-like structures for specification and modelling
is by now widespread in all areas of computer science as well
as in many fields of computational research and engineering.
Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, which may be
captured by rule-based manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph
transformation form a universal modelling paradigm for formal
reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of given
properties to the discovery of new insights.

The International Conference on Graph Transformation series
aims at fostering the exchange and collaboration of researchers
working with graphs and graph transformation, either contributing
to theoretical foundations or applying established formalisms to
classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as an
established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to
boost inter/intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.

The conference takes place under the auspices of EATCS and
IFIP WG 1.3. The proceedings are published by Springer in its
LNCS series.

**VENUE**

Due to the restrictions related to Covid-19, ICGT 2020 will be held
as an online conference on June 25-26, 2020.

The event will be broadcasted on the official YouTube channel of
the University of Pisa. Links will be available a few days before
the conference on the online program page.

**PROGRAM**

The conference program is online at

**KEYNOTE TALK**

Bob Coecke (University of Oxford)
Quantum natural language processing
(on actual quantum hardware)

**REGISTRATION**

Attending the conference is free of charge, the streaming sessions
will be freely available. A textual interaction will be possible for
the audience, and all the questions will be visibile to session
chairs and speakers.
