The paper

John Bourke, 2017, Equipping weak equivalences with algebraic structure.
                     https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02523.

has a terminology for this that is appealing: an algebraic injective
object, with respect to a class J of arrows, is an object D equipped
with extensions c(j,f) :  Y -> D for each j:X->Y in J and f : X -> D.
(Then you can consider the obvious morphisms of algebraic injective
objects that commute with the designated extensions c(j,f).)

Thanks to Mike Shulman for this reference.
