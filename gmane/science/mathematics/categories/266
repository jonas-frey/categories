  Workshop announcement: 18 June 2009 at Burnside Hall, McGill, Montreal.

   We wish to announce a one-day workshop seminar, a "prequel" to the
   Makkaifest which is being held at CRM 19-20 June (with a reception
   on the evening of 18 June).

    http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Makkaifest09/
    http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Makkaifest09/index_e.php

   This workshop is intended for the participants of the Makkaifest,
   and will end in time to allow attendance at the reception at 6pm.

   If you are interested in attending the workshop, please let us (Phil
   Scott or Robert Seely) know so we can book a room of suitable size.
   Any participants who would like to give a talk in the workshop should
   contact one of the workshop organisers (Phil Scott or Robert Seely)
   *as soon as possible*, as places are very limited.  The themes of
   the workshop are those of the Makkaifest itself, and should reflect the
   interests shown by Michael Makkai over his career.

   We will announce a schedule of talks later, probably late May or
   early June.  We expect the talks to start around 9am and to finish
   by 5pm, so there'll be time to get to the reception at CRM at 6pm.

   The workshop will be an informal affair - there will be no
   registration, and no "refreshments" (people can buy their own
   coffee, and lunch will be "dutch treat").
