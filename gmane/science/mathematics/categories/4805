Calculus teachers do something similar when they make an epsilon-delta proof
into a game:  The opponent picks an epsilon (the test object) and you have
to come up with a delta.
There is one big difference between epsilon-delta proofs and limits.  To
show that something is a limit you have to find, for each test object, the
unique arrow specified by the definition of limit.  Thus you are producing a
function (indeed, a bijection).   The delta for a given epsilon is not unique,
and so there is no natural function giving a delta for each epsilon.  I am
pretty sure this makes epsilon-delta proofs harder for non-talented students
than proving something is a limit.  I know some calculus teachers talk about
there being a function that takes epsilon to delta, but I suspect it is a
mistake to bring that up.
