I believe the idea *came* from Artin but I don't believe Artin was 
thinking of it as a *construction* of the reals.  I was so taken by 
the construction that I thought it should be better known by tertiary 
teachers.  I wrote a little note

	An efficient construction of the real numbers,
	Gazette Australian Math. Soc. 12 (1985) 57-58

on the construction (giving credit to Schanuel and reporting that 
Peter Johnstone told me Richard Lewis from Sussex had also come up 
with it).
[Warning and Challenge: Steve pointed out that my note messes up the 
construction of the sup operation.]

Happy 2000 plus.
