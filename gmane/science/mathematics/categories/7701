Dear Jean (and Toby)=2C=A0=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
The notion of equivalence of categories suggested by Toby is precisely the =
one introduced in the paper Marta Bunge and Robert Pare=2C "Stacks and Equi=
valence of Indexed Categories"=2C Cahiers de Top. et Geo. Diff. =2C Vol XX-=
4 (1979) 373-399. =A0S is a topos.=A0=0A=
=0A=
Definition (1.3) =A0We say that two S-indexed categories A and B are weakly=
  equivalent if there exists an S-indexed category E and a span A <-E->B of =
weak equivalence functors (fully faithful and essentially surjective) E->A =
and E->B.=0A=
=0A=
Proposition (1.4) Weak equivalence is an equivalence relation. Proof. The r=
elation is trivially reflexive and symmetric. Composition is defined by mea=
ns of (what we call) a 2-pullback=2C from which it follows that the relatio=
n is transitive.=A0=0A=
=0A=
This answers your question (i).=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
Proposition (1.6) Let C and D be small categories (internal to S). If =A0th=
eir externalizations [C] and [D] are weakly equivalent=2C then one can choo=
se D small with [D] ->[C]=2C[D] -> [B] weak equivalences. In this case one =
can simply resort to entirely internal definition of weak equivalence so th=
at =A0C <-D->B is a span in S. Proof. See pages 377-378.=A0=0A=
=0A=
Remark (page 384). Equivalence implies weak equivalence. Weak equivalence i=
mplies equivalence iff (AC) holds. Weak equivalence implies local equivalen=
ce iff (IAC) holds Local equivalence does not imply weak equivalence. Equiv=
alence implies local equivalence. Local equivalence implies equivalence iff=
  every object of S with full support has a global section.=A0=0A=
=0A=
Corollary (2.12) (to Definition 2.10). Let F:A->B be a weak equivalence fun=
ctor between S-indexed categories where B is a stack. Then F:A->B is "the" =
(that is=2C up to equivalence) stack completion of A.=0A=
=0A=
Corollary (2.12). Let A and B be S-indexed categories and let F: A->A'=2C G=
:B->B' be weak equivalence functors with A' and B' stacks. If A and B are w=
eakly equivalent=2C then A' and B' are equivalent=2C and conversely.=A0=0A=
=0A=
Rekark (at the end of Section 2). The associated stack of any locally small=
  S-indexed category is constructed in (Marta Bunge=2C Stack completions and=
  Morita equivalence for categories in a topos=2C Cahiers de Top.Gem. Diff =
=A0XX-4 (1979) 401-436). The stack completion of a locally small category A=
  is (can be taken to be) a locally small category A'. However=2C it is not =
in genera the case that the stack completion of a small category C =A0be sm=
all. Say that S satisfies the Axiom of Stack Completions (ASC) if the stack=
  completion of a category in S can be taken to be small. Any Grothendieck t=
opos S satisfies (ASC).=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
Let me point out that nothing special about S-indexed categories is employe=
d here that could not have been done with fibrations over S. We could have =
defined weak equivalence of small categories (in S) directly but the genera=
l theory of stacks demanded that we dealt with arbitrary S-indexed catgeori=
es=2C or with arbitrary fibrations over S.=A0=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
As for an answer to your question (ii)=2C any small category X with X->1 a =
weak equivalence gives a span 1<-X->1 as desired. One of them is of course =
1<-1->1. Such categories X have 1 as their stack completion=2C so they are =
all themselves weakly equivalent. In other words=2C up to weak equivalence =
there is only one such span 1<-X->1.=A0=0A=
