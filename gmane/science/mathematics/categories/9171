Dear colleagues,

Mitacs, a Canadian funding organization, has just announced that they
will support up to 100 foreign graduate students, in all disciplines,
to spend 12-24 weeks doing research in Canada. The funding is somewhat
cryptically reserved for students "with uncertain status in their
current location".

I can only guess what that means. I imagine, for example, that if some
graduate student were studying in a country that has recently elected
a populist right-wing government issuing random travel bans, causing
the student to be stuck outside that country, then this would be
exactly the sort of student Canada would love to welcome.

If you know anyone in that situation, please direct them to this
website:
