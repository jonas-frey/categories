I think that as a 'proponent of "structures"' Bourbaki had NOT include
categories - and not only because of the size problem. A more fundamental
reason seems me to be this. Structures are things determined up to isomor=
phism;
in the structuralist mathematics the notion of isomorphism is basic and t=
he
notion of general morphism is derived (as in Bourbaki).  In CT this is th=
e
other way round: the notion of general morphism is basic while isos are d=
efined
through a specific property (of reversibility).
This is why the inclusion of CT would require a revision of fundamentals =
of
Bourbaki's structuralist thinking. Although CT for obvious historical rea=
sons
is closely related to structuralist mathematics it is not, in my understa=
nding,
a part of structuralist mathematics - at least not if one takes CT *serio=
usly*,
i.e. as foundations.

best,
andrei
