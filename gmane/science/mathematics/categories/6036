Dear Sergey, In the paper by Hyland,  Levy, Power and myself,
Combining algebraic effects with continuations, there is a proof that
the tensor of the continuations monad R^(R^-) (|R| >=3D 2) with itself,
or, indeed with any monad T with a constant (i.e. such that T(0) is
not empty), is the trivial monad.

It is not hard to see this directly, via large Lawvere theories. The
large Lawvere theory L of the continuations monad has:

   L(X,Y) =3D Set(R^X,R^Y)

and so the constants L(0,1) correspond to maps 1 --> R. Further, using
two distinct constants, any two operations  R^X --> R^Y can be coded
up into one operation R^(X +1) --> R^Y and then recovered via the two
constants. Given maps of large Lawvere theories L_T ---> M <----L such
that the images of any two operations in L_T and L commute, as L_T has
a constant all (the images of) constants in L are identified, as
usual, but then so are all images of any two operations R^X --> R^Y
(which will, for example, include all pairs of projections) and so M
is trivial.

A more general theorem is also proved in the paper which has as a
consequence that the tensor of any monad with rank with the
continuations monad exists.
