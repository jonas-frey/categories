                             PROBMIV'99     

  2nd International Workshop on Probabilistic Methods in Verification

                  http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/probmiv99/ 

                       a satellite to CONCUR'99
 
                       Eindhoven, 23rd Aug 1999 
           (to coincide with EXPRESS'99, another satellite)

SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP 
  
  Probability inherently features in software and hardware systems,
  either as a means to derive efficient solutions (e.g. randomization),
  or as a result of unreliable or unpredictable behaviour (e.g.
  fault-tolerant systems, computer networks, etc).  *Probabilistic
  verification* encompasses a range of theoretical, algorithmic and
  programming methods that assist in establishing the correctness of
  probabilistic systems against specifications.  Typically this involves
  calculating the probability bounds for a temporal logic formula being
  satisfied, based on an appropriate probability space on computations,
  but also includes properties such as cost analysis and long-run
  average.  Additionally, probabilistic verification can provide
  guarantees the specifications hold with satisfactory probability in
  cases when conventional model checking is not feasible.


  The idea of this workshop is to bring together researchers that apply
  probabilistic methods across the whole spectrum of verification. The
  meeting aims to enable cross-fertilisation of ideas and techniques
  between areas that are usually not in regular contact through
  conferences, from semantics, probability theory, performance analysis
  and computational linear algebra, through randomized algorithms,
  probabilistic  logics, model checking, abstract interpretation, to
  practical experimental work, tools and applications.

  This is the second workshop of this kind.  The first meeting,
  PROBMIV'98 was held in 1998 as a satellite to LICS.  In 1999, the
  workshop takes place as a satellite to CONCUR.

RELATED EVENTS

   PROBMIV'99 is organized as a satellite workshop of CONCUR'99, the 10th
   International Conference on Concurrency Theory, which will take place
   in Eindhoven on August 24-27, 1999.  PROBMIV'99 coincides with the
   EXPRESS'99 workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency, another
   satellite of CONCUR'99.

    
REGISTRATION
   is via the registration form for CONCUR'99, available at URL
     http://www.win.tue.nl/concur99/  
   There is no registration charge for PROBMIV'99, but pre-registration
   is required.
   Note that early registration for CONCUR'99 ends on ***1st July***.
