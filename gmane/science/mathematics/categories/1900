   The TACS Symposium will focus on the theoretical foundations of
   programming and their applications. The topics of interest include...
   
     Theoretical aspects of the design, semantics, analysis, and
     implementation of programming languages and systems; logics of
     programs; calculi and models of concurrency and parallel
     computation; theories of mobile computation and system security;
     categories and types in computer science; formalisms, methods, and
     systems for program specification, verification, synthesis, and
     optimization; constructive, linear, and modal logics in computer
     science.
     
   The scientific program will consist of invited lectures, contributed
   talks, and demo sessions.  A proceedings containing the full papers of
   the invited and contributed talks will be published by Springer-Verlag
   as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
