The first time the term "category theory" (I mean, exactly that term)
appeared in Mathemtical Reviews was in the review of

Rosen, R. [1961]: `A relational theory of  the structural changes
induced in biological systems by alterations in  environment', {\em
Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics} \bf 23}, pp.~165--71.

The full review reads:

The author uses, among other things, some previous results from his
biologico-mathematical applications of abstract category theory [#B416]
in order to further develop another paper concerning relational biology
[#B418]. Some biological applications are treated; e.g., an
interpretation of the mitotic cycle.

Rosen's earlier related works are reviewed as dealing with "the theory
of categories."

best, Colin
