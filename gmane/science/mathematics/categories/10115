Aims and Scope
-------------------------------------------------------

The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for =
specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer =
science as well as in many fields of computational research and =
engineering. Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer =
structures, state space graphs, control/data flow graphs, UML and other =
domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical =
environments, and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo =
dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various =
kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph =
manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental =
universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning =
and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of =
interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights.

The International Conference on Graph Transformation aims at fostering =
exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds =
working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to =
their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to =
classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a =
well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform =
to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new =
ideas.

The 13th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2020) =
will be held in Bergen, Norway, as part of STAF 2020 (Software =
Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place =
under the auspices of EATCS and IFIP WG 1.3. Proceedings will be =
published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) =
series.


Topics of Interest
-------------------------------------------------------

In order to foster a lively exchange of perspectives on the subject of =
the conference, the programme committee of ICGT 2020 encourages all =
kinds of contributions related to graphs and graph transformation, =
either from a theoretical point of view or a practical one.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following =
subjects:

- General models of graph transformation (e.g. adhesive categories and =
hyperedge replacement systems)
- Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems
- Graph theoretical properties of graph languages
- Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages
- Logical aspects of graph transformation
- Computational models based on graphs
- Structuring and modularization of graph transformation
- Hierarchical graphs and decomposition of graphs
- Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformation
- Term graph and string diagram rewriting
- Petri nets and other models of concurrency
- Business process models and notations
- Bigraphs and bigraphical reactive systems
- Graph databases and graph queries
- Model-driven development and model transformation
- Model checking, program analysis and verification, simulation and =
animation
- Syntax, semantics and implementation of programming languages, =
including domain-specific and visual languages
- Graph transformation languages and tool support
- Efficient algorithms (e.g. pattern matching, graph traversal, network =
analysis)
- Applications and case studies in software engineering (e.g. software =
architectures, refactoring, access control, and service-orientation)
- Applications to computing paradigms (e.g. bio-inspired, quantum, =
ubiquitous, and visual)


Important Dates
-------------------------------------------------------

Abstract submission: February 21, 2020
Paper submission: February 28, 2020
Notification: April 10, 2020
Camera-ready: May 01, 2020
Conference: June 22-26, 2020


Submission Guidelines
-------------------------------------------------------

Papers can be submitted at =
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dicgt2020 =
<http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dicgt2020> using Springer's =
LNCS format (http://www.springer.com/lncs =
<http://www.springer.com/lncs>). For regular and tool demonstration =
papers, simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or =
submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is not =
allowed. The page limits are strict and include references.

Papers are solicited in three categories:

- Regular papers (limited to 16 pages in Springer LNCS format)
describe innovative contributions and are evaluated with respect to =
their originality, significance, and technical soundness. We also =
solicit case studies describing applications of graph transformation in =
any application domain. Additional material intended for reviewers but =
not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly =
marked appendix.

- Tool presentation papers (limited to 8 pages in Springer LNCS format)
demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A =
tool presentation paper may have an appendix with a detailed demo =
description (up to 4 pages), which will be reviewed but not included in =
the proceedings.

- New ideas papers (limited to 2 pages in Springer LNCS format)
report on relevant contributions to the  theory or applications of graph =
transformation, which may have been published (or accepted for =
publication) in a peer-reviewed conference other than ICGT, as a book =
chapter or journal article since 2018. Papers in this category will be =
selected for presentation at the conference according to their relevance =
to the graph transformation community, and they will be considered for =
the special issues. Submissions will consist of a 2-page abstract. In =
case of extended abstracts of published papers, the submission must =
refer to the published paper and include the original paper in PDF.


Special Issues
-------------------------------------------------------

We are pleased to confirm two special issues for ICGT2020, devoted to =
the theoretical and application-oriented sides of the conference, =
respectively. The former is going to appear in Theoretical Computer =
Science (https://www.journals.elsevier.com/theoretical-computer-science =
<https://www.journals.elsevier.com/theoretical-computer-science>), the =
latter has been accepted as special issue in Science of Computer =
Programming =
(https://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming =
<https://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming>).
