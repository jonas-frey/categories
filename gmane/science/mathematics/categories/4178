Street and Walters (1973) called a category A total when its Yoneda
embedding has a left adjoint and proved that such a category is compact
in the sense of Isbell, that is: every functor F: A --> B preserving all
colimits has a right adjoint (some provisions on the size of hom sets
need to be made). There are many papers on the fairly rich supply of
total categories, by Wood (1982) and myself with B"orger (1990) and
Adamek (1990), and by others. There is also paper dealing specifically
with compact categories, by B"orger, Tholen, Wischnewsky and Wolff (JPAA
21 (1981) 129-144). Theorem 4.1 of that paper says explicitly:

Let P: A --> X be a semitopological functor over a compact category X.
Then a  monoidal structure on A is closed if and only if A \ten (-)
preserves all colimits.

The reason of course is that semitopological functors "lift" compactness
(and so do monadic functors - Rattray 1975). The theorem below gives
extra conditions to make sure that preservation of small colimits
suffices. There is a lot more literature on that latter aspect,
particularly by Kelly.
