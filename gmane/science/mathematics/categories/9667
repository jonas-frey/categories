============================================================

Call for Lecture Proposals

International School on Rewriting, Paris, 1-5 July 2019

http://cbr.uibk.ac.at/ifip-wg1.6/summerschool.html

Deadline: September 1st

============================================================

In 2019, ISR will take place at MINES ParisTech, Paris.

Rewriting is a powerful model of computation that underlies much of
declarative programming and is ubiquituous in mathematics, logic,
theorem proving, verification, model-checking, compilation, biology,
chemistry, physics, etc.

The school is aimed at Master and PhD students, researchers and
practitioners interested in the use or the study of rewriting
and its applications.

We intend to offer a basic track and an advanced track on more
specialized topics, related to state-of-the-art research and novel
applications. The typical day will contain 4 slots of 90 minutes.

The inscription fees of ISR are traditionally low and will be waived
for the speakers. The speakers will receive travel and accommodation
support if they live far from Paris.

If you are interested in giving a lecture in the advanced track, send us
a mail before the deadline above with the following informations:
- a title,
- an abstract,
- an outline of the lecture,
- some bibliographical references,
- an expected duration (in number of slots),
- whether the lecture includes exercises or experiments (preferred).

We encourage applications from both theory and applications and will
pay particular attention to submissions on topics not covered in the
the last schools.

Timeline:
- September 1st : submission
- October 1st (or earlier) : notification

Fr??d??ric Blanqui and Olivier Hermant, organizers of ISR 2019.
