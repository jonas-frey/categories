I'm eclectic, and prefer closer contact with the real world of existing
applications.
There the overwhelming majority of the literature uses universal covers
as usually
constructed. I didn't go into it, but the dependence of that on the
basepoint is also
ephemeral: you get a universal covering space functor from the
fundamental groupoid
to such coverings easily enough. That is also used in applications
(quite recently by
Kate Ponto in work on fixed point theory). In any case, I don't place
the emphasis you
do on this matter, which I regard as minor from the point of view of
algebraic topology.
