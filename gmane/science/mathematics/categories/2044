                     Domains VI


           Birmingham, 16-19 September 2002.

    The Workshop on Domains is aimed at computer scientists and
mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
foundations of computation. The workshop will focus on domains, their
applications and related topics.  Previous meetings were held in
Darmstadt (94,99), Braunschweig (96), Munich (97) and Siegen (98). The
emphasis is on the exchange of ideas between participants similar in
style to Dagstuhl seminars.

SCOPE

    Domain theory has had applications to programming language
semantics and logics (lambda-calculus, PCF, LCF), recursion theory
(Kleene-Kreisel countable functionals), general topology (injective
spaces, function spaces, locally compact spaces, Stone duality),
topological algebra (compact Hausdorff semilattices) and analysis
(measure, integration, dynamical systems). Moreover, these
applications are related - for example, Stone duality gives rise to a
logic of observable properties of computational processes.

    As such, domain theory is highly interdisciplinary. Topics of
interaction with domain theory for this workshop include, but are not
limited to:

     program semantics
     program logics
     probabilistic computation
     exact computation over the real numbers
     lambda calculus
     games
     models of sequential computation
     constructive mathematics
     recursion theory
     realizability
     real analysis
     topology
     locale theory
     metric spaces
     category theory
     topos theory
     type theory

SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS

    One-page abstracts should be submitted to

                  domainsvi@cs.bham.ac.uk

    Shortly after an abstract is submitted (usually one or two weeks),
    the authors will be notified by the programme committee. Abstracts
    will be dealt with on a first-come/first-served basis.

DEADLINE

    30 April 2002

ACCOMODATION

    We meeting will take place at "The Manor House" halls of residence
of the University of Birmingham (http://www.bham.ac.uk/conferences/#Manor).
More details will be provided at a later date.

PROGRAMME COMMITTEE

    Martin Escardo    University of Birmingham
    Achim Jung        University of Birmingham
    Klaus Keimel      Darmstadt University
    Alex Simpson      University of Edinburgh

ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE

    Martin Escardo    University of Birmingham
    Achim Jung        University of Birmingham

PUBLICATION

    We plan to publish proceedings of the workshop in lecture notes
series. There will be a call for papers after the workshop takes
place. The papers will be refereed according to normal publication
standards.
