Hi Toby,=A0=0A=0AMany thanks for your comments. =A0=0A=0AOver the weekend, =
I noticed a (probable) mistake in my previous posting: namely, the assertio=
n that _only_ the admissibility axiom could require overtness of the locale=
  in question. =A0In fact, the natural way to define composition of entourag=
es (qua relations) is to apply first the inverse image of=A0=0A=A0 1xDeltax=
1 : LxLxL ---> LxLxLxL,=A0=0Aand then the open image of=A0=0A=A0 1x!x1: LxL=
xL ---> LxL. =A0=0AThus the intuitive way of writing down the square-refine=
ment axiom also requires L to be overt. =A0(Btw, when discussing that axiom=
  in my previous post, I carelessly wrote "epi" where I obviously meant "cof=
inal".) =A0Perhaps there is some other way of expressing that axiom, but I =
no longer care: I've reconciled myself to the idea that uniformity requires=
  overtness.=0A=0AI also made some progress on=A0=0A=0A>> Perhaps, if we def=
ine a Weil pseudo-uniformity=0A>> on L to be exactly as above minus the adm=
issibility axiom, it is=0A>> possible---at least in the case of a localic t=
opos E=3DShv(X)---to describe=0A>> a second locale underlying the pseudouni=
formity? If so, then we don't=0A>> really need formulate the admissibility =
axiom in the internal language of=0A>> the topos.=0A=0ANamely, I have an id=
ea of how this might be done, but it requires a detour through gauge spaces=
  (=3Duniformities defined via families of pseudometrics, for those not fami=
liar with the terminology) which I'm not sure is constructively valid. =A0I=
n any case, I like this idea: in particular, if it works, then one could ap=
ply it to the case where L is a discrete locale and investigate to what ext=
ent the idea of a uniform space as a _set_ together with a family of entour=
ages fails to capture the general idea. =A0=0A=0ACheers,=0AJeff.
