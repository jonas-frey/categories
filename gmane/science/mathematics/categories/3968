FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

9th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction (MPC'08=
)

Marseille (Luminy), France, July 15-18th 2008

http://mpc08.lri.fr

BACKGROUND

The biennial MPC conferences aim to promote the development of
mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical
and effective in the process of constructing computer programs. Topics
of interest range from algorithmics to support for program
construction in programming languages and systems.

The previous conferences were held in Twente, The Netherlands (1989),
Oxford, UK (1992), Kloster Irsee, Germany (1995), Marstrand, Sweden
(1998), Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000), Dagstuhl, Germany (2002),
Stirling, UK (2004, colocated with AMAST '04) and Kuressaare, Estonia
(2006, colocated with AMAST '06).

The 2008 conference will be held in Marseille, France at the
International Center for Mathematical Meetings
(http://http://www.cirm.univ-mrs.fr/web.ang).

INVITED SPEAKERS

To be announced.

IMPORTANT DATES

    * Submission of abstracts: 14 January 2008
    * Submission of full papers: 21 January 2008
    * Notification of authors: 10 March 2008
    * Camera-ready version: 10 April 2008

TOPICS

Papers are solicited on mathematical methods and tools put to use in
program construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to
support for program construction in programming languages and
systems. Some typical areas are type systems, program analysis and
transformation, programming-language semantics, program
logics. Theoretical contributions are welcome provided their relevance
for program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome
provided their mathematical basis is evident.

SUBMISSION

Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text) must be submitted
by 14 January 2008. Full papers (pdf) adhering to the llncs style must
be submitted by 21 January 2008. There is no official page limit, but
authors should strive for brevity. The web-based submission system
will open in early December 2007.

Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted
concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. Accepted
papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.

The proceedings of MPC'08 will be published in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series of Springer-Verlag.

After the conference, the authors of the best papers will be invited
to submit revised versions to a special issue of the Science of
Computer Programming journal of Elsevier.

VENUE

The conference will be held in Marseille, the second largest city in
France next to Paris. Its port is the most important in France,
and opens the city to the world through the Mediterranean Sea.
MPC'08  will be hosted  by the  International Center for Mathematical
Meetings. The center is located inside the Campus of Luminy Faculty.
It is close to the "Calanques", an astounding wild coastline composed
of creeks stretching from Marseille to Cassis.

LOCAL ORGANIZERS

MPC 2008 is organized with the support of INRIA.

The local organizers are Philippe Audebaud and Christine Paulin-Mohring.
Enquiries regarding the programme (submission etc.) should be addressed
