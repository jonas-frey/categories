The thoughts being developed by Tom Leinster give renewed hope that
results of 40 years ago are being further developed, beyond mere icons,
into tools for actual analysis of algebraic problems *.

I should perhaps have mentioned Lourdes Sousa's very interesting talk at
White Point. She and Michel Hebert had divided the presentation of the
work into existential (or injective) logic, and uniquely existential
logic, and the latter is more directly relevant to the present discussion.

The fact that a contravariant adjoint pair gives rise to Galois
connections at each object is important in many different situations, for
example in the classical study of rings of continuous functions on
topological spaces. The information inherent in this remark is less
visible if one arbitrarily restricts consideration to general epis and
general monos (it was here that Tom made a "wrong turn" in his items
4.(i) and 4.(ii) ). To recover the classical Galois connection of
universal algebra one must apply adjointness, and then take surjective (or
regular epimorphic) images. The above general remark depends on the
availability of operations like image in the categories that are being
confronted in the adjointness.

Again, I emphasize that in the classical case of continuous functions, it
is important to consider algebras A which are not of the form C(Y). A
possibly useful remark is that, under suitable restrictions on the
category of spaces, the Stone-Weierstrass theorem can be interpreted as
the statement that A --> C(X) is an epimorphism of rings iff its mate
X --> Spec(A) is a monomorphism. But then by restricting the kind of
epimorphisms and monomorphisms considered one obtains Galois connections
which were originally considered by Stone in the 1930s before the more
general functorial formulation which many of us learned from
J.L. Kelley's General Topology.

If one considers a tractable functor X --> Sem(T) from a very general
category X into a very special kind of category of the classical universal
algebra type, (i.e. where T is from the special doctrine of categories
with finite products, etc.) then the structure functor Str assigns to the
composite functor X --> Sets a definite algebraic theory Str(X) with a
morphism of theories T -->Str(X). The surjective image of the latter
morphism, of course, is the embodiment of the classical construction in
the special case where the original tractable functor was a full
inclusion. However, there are many full inclusions for which one has
X = Sem(Str(X)), i.e. X is an algebraic category even though it is not a
variety in Sem(T).

Remark: The difference between an object (in this case an algebraic
category) and an inclusion map (in this discussion a full inclusion
functor) is of course not eliminated by restricting to the case where T is
a free theory. It seems reasonable to use the classical term "variety" to
refer to those inclusion functors fixed under Birkhoff's Galois
correspondence, i.e. to those for which not only is X equal to the
semantics of its structure, but for which moreover the morphism of
theories T --> Str(X) is already surjective (which of course it is not in
the example mentioned of groups in monoids).

There are several local studies possible within the context of a given
global adjoint. It seems to be an open problem to describe those full
inclusions X --> Sem(T) for which T --> Str(X) is a localization (in which
case the inclusion, if fixed, might be called "open" in contrast to the
Birkhoff subvarieties which are clearly analogous to "closed" subspaces).
A further problem: "locally closed" is a kind of inclusion of interest in
geometry, so why should it not be also here?

* see also the paper "Some Algebraic Problems..." following the Thesis in
the TAC Reprints.
