The Quantum Group at the Department of Computer Science has three =
fixed-term postdoctoral research assistant positions of which two are =
expected to last for at least 2 years and one for 1 year, starting =
October 2014 or as soon as possible thereafter.=20

The positions are funded by the EPSRC Grants `A Unified Model of =
Compositional and Distributional Semantics: Theory and Applications' and =
`Quantum Mathematics and Computation', the AFORS grant `Algorithmic and =
Logical Aspects when Composing Meanings', and the JTF grant `Categorical =
Unification: where Foundational Physics, Natural Language and Rational =
Processes Meet'.

The successful candidates will be expected to contribute to the research =
of the quantum group which is led by Professors Samson Abramsky and Bob =
Coecke and includes Drs Jon Barrett, Chris Heunen and Jamie Vicary as =
senior members.=20

Up to two of the positions will be on compositional distributional =
models of natural language meaning, led by Professor Bob Coecke, and in =
collaboration with Professor Stephen Pulman in the linguistics group.=20

More information about the quantum group and its research is available =
at:
www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/

Applicants must have experience in one of the following areas:
- quantum information and/or mathematical physics and/or quantum =
foundations
- computational linguistics and/or natural language processing
- applied logic and/or applied category theory.

The closing date for applications is 12.00 noon on 31 July 2014.  =
