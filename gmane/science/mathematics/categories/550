CONCUR 98: Purpose and Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers, and students in order to advance the theory
of concurrency, and promote its applications. Interest in this
topic is continuously growing, as a consequence of the importance
 of concurrent systems and their applications, and of the scientific
relevance of their foundations.

The scope of CONCUR'98 covers all areas of semantics, logics, and
verification techniques for concurrent systems.  A list of specific
topics includes (but is not limited to) concurrency related aspects of
models of computation and semantic domains, process algebras, Petri
nets, event structures, real-time systems, hybrid systems,
decidability, model-checking, verification techniques, refinement
techniques, term and graph rewriting, distributed programming, logic
constraint programming, object-oriented programming, typing systems
and algorithms, case studies, tools and environments for programming
and verification.


Submissions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submissions should consist of a 100-200 word ASCII abstract and a
summary (up to 15 pages, typeset 12 points; about 7000 words,
excluding bibliography and figures).  Simultaneous submissions to
other conferences or journals are not allowed.  Electronic submissions
are strongly encouraged; instructions may be found at the CONCUR'98
web page, or obtained by sending an email with subject ``submission
information'' to the address c98-subm@sophia.inria.fr.  If surface
mail is used, then five (5) copies of the paper should be sent to the
following address: Concur'98, INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, BP 93, F-06902
Sophia-Antipolis Cedex, France.

Proceedings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS
series. A special issue of Theoretical Computer Science is planned. 

Venue and local arrangements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nice is ideally located on the French Riviera. September is still very
pleasant, while less crowded than the high season. Nice's
international airport is well-connected to all major european and
non-european cities.

The conference will be held at the Hotel Novotel , which is
conveniently located in the heart of Nice, between the city center and
the old town, and 20 minutes walk to the beach.
