stimulating

> HaPoC has chosen to have no parallel sessions.
> Our invited speakers are: Janet Abbate; Bernard Chazelle (tbc); Walter
> Dean; Nathan Ensmenger; Jean-Yves Girard; Barbara Liskov (tbc); Margit
> Rosen and Franck Varenne. HaPoC 2013 is the follow-up conference to
> HaPoC 2011 (Gent, Belgium).
> Please check out the website of HaPoC 2013 for more information on the
> conference:

> For HaPoC 2013 we welcome contributions from logicians, philosophers =
and
> historians of computing as well as from philosophically aware computer
> scientists and mathematicians. Topics include but are not limited to:

> a. History and Philosophy of Computability
> b. History and Philosophy of Computation=20
> c. History and Philosophy of Programming=20
