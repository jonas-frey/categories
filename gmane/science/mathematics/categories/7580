    Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop that brin=
gs together researchers in theoretical computer science and category theory=
, and in the past has met in Halifax, Ottawa, Calgary, Vancouver, Spokane, =
and Portland. It has been the source for fruitful collaboration and present=
ation of results related to these areas. Recent workshops have had discussi=
ons on areas such as quantum programming languages, restriction categories,=
  database design, and the differential and resource lambda-calculi.  This y=
ear's meeting will be hosted in the Department of Mathematics and Computer =
Science at Mount Allison University in Sackville, Canada.


   There will be an informal welcoming reception in the evening of May 31st,=
  starting at 5:30. The scientific program starts on June 1st, and consists =
of tutorials, invited talks, and contributed talks. There will be an excurs=
ion on one of the afternoons. The meeting ends on the afternoon of June 3rd=
.  Participants may wish to note that the summer CMS meeting begins the fol=
lowing day in Halifax (a 2 hour drive from Sackville) with a special sessio=
n on higher categories.

   Invited speakers are Joachim Kock (Barcelona), Ernie Manes (Massachusetts=
), Eugenio Moggi (Genoa) and Michael Shulman (Institute for Advanced Study)=
.

   The organizing committee is Robin Cockett, Geoff Cruttwell (local organiz=
er), Phil Mulry, John Macdonald, Dorette Pronk, and Bob Rosebrugh (local or=
ganizer).
