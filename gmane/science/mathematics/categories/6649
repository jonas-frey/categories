Dear Andre=2C
In connection with the current discussion on explanatory proofs=2C and more=
  particularly about the difference between computer generated proofs and hu=
man ones=2C I have something to add to what you wrote --drawn from my own e=
xperience.=A0Humans do not have either the speed or the ability to hold the=
  enormous amounts of information that machines do. On the other hand=2C the=
  only way to see the big picture is speed of reasoning coupled with intuiti=
on - naturally without checking the details at each step. That way=2C two t=
hings may happen to humans of which computers are free of: (1) errors are m=
ade=2C and (2) new ideas originate. Errors are not a good thing=2C =A0of co=
urse=2C but they are a possible outcome from taking risks=2C without which =
no new ideas would ever surface. Working out the details of that first glim=
pse of the truth may be painful=2C but necessary. =A0It may lead to truth (=
hardly ever)=2C or to further glimpses. I agree with you that the sequence =
intuition --> computation---> intuition---> computation-->.... is the only =
available course of action for a good mathematician. With luck=2C the seque=
nce terminates eventually=2C and it does in truth. But it must begin with i=
ntuition. Some of my collaborators have expressed surprise at my starting a=
ny investigation with a title and an abstract=2C when they would leave both=
  for the end. Naturally=2C that title and abstract may very well change at =
the end of the investigation=2C but if I were incapable to see the big pict=
ure at first=2C I would not begin any work at all. A final trivial thought =
- computation alone is not mathematics=2C and neither is intuition alone. T=
he former is typical of machines=2C whereas the latter is typical of artist=
s.=A0

Best regards=2CMarta
