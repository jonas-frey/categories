MFPS XXXIV 2018 : Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics=0A=
Call for papers=0A=
=0A=
The 34th Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantic=
s (MFPS XXXIV) will take place at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, =
from June 6=969, 2018.=0A=
=0A=
MFPS 2018 will be co-located with the 15th International Conference on Quan=
tum Physics and Logic (QPL) 2018, which takes place from June 3=967.=0A=
=0A=
MFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and comp=
uter science that are related to models of computation in general, and to s=
emantics of programming languages in particular. This is a forum where rese=
archers in mathematics and computer science can meet and exchange ideas. Th=
e participation of researchers in neighbouring areas is strongly encouraged=
.=0A=
=0A=
Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: concurrent qualitati=
ve and quantitative distributed systems; process calculi; probabilistic sys=
tems; constructive mathematics; domain theory and categorical models; forma=
l languages; formal methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; programming-l=
anguage theory; quantum computation; security; topological models; logic; t=
ype systems; type theory. We also welcome contributions that address applic=
ations of semantics to novel areas such as complex systems, markets, and ne=
tworks, for example.=0A=

## SUBMISSION=0A=
=0A=
### Important dates:=0A=
=0A=
* April 1: abstract submission=0A=
* April 6: paper submission=0A=
* May 11: notification of authors=0A=
* May 25: final papers ready=0A=
* June 6=969: conference=0A=
=0A=
### Submitting=0A=
=0A=
Submissions should be prepared using the ENTCS Macros (http://www.entcs.org=
/) and should be up to 12 pages long excluding bibliography and appendices.=
  Submissions is via EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmf=
ps34).=0A=
NB =0A=
* The original call for papers, in reference to an older style file, sugges=
ted up to 15 pages. Authors may still submit up to 15 pages using the old s=
tyle file. But they are encouraged to use the latest ENTCS style file, date=
d 6 March 2018, and up to 12 pages, which is actually more generous because=
  of font and margin differences.=0A=
* Although QPL and MFPS are co-located, they have different submission site=
s and programme committees.=0A=
=0A=
### Proceedings=0A=
=0A=
A preliminary version will be distributed at the meeting. Final proceedings=
  will be published in ENTCS after the meeting. ENTCS is open access.=0A=
