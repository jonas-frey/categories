Dear all,

I completely agree with George.

By the way, I studied such kind of categories (among others) in:
"Intrinsic centrality and associated classifying properties"
J. of Algebra, 256, 2002, 126-145.
I called them "linear", following Lawvere and Schanuel's "Conceptual
Mathematics".

Truly yours,

Dominique
