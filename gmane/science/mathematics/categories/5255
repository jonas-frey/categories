I agree with you about generalities concerning pre-formal and formal
concepts. A reason why I say CCAF is not a satisfactory categorical found=
ation
is different. ETC is the formal basis of CCAF and ETC relies on a pre-for=
mal
notion of set or collection just like ZF or any other axiomatic theory bu=
ilt
with Hilbert-Tarski axiomatic method. Elements of a new properly categori=
cal
method of theory-building are present in the "basic theory" (BC) that fol=
lows
ETC. (I mean, in particular, the "redefinition" of functor in BC as 2-->A=
, etc.
The standard definition of functor given earlier in ETC never reappears i=
n BC.)
However in CCAF these new features are not yet developed into an autonomo=
us
axiomatic method - or into a new way of formalisation of pre-formal conce=
pts,
if you like. In my understanding, such a method should meake part of
categorical foundations deserving the name.  CCAF remains in this sense
eclectic, it is a half-way to categorical foundations.

best,
