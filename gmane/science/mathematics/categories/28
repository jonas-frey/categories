I would  like to raise an objection  to using the term `2-group' as on =
nlab and elsehere since for the group theorists this has a specialised =
meaning: See the following wiki entry, especially the first 2 words:=20

"In mathematics, given a prime number p, a p-group is a periodic group =
in which each element has a power of p as its order. That is, for each =
element g of the group, there exists a nonnegative integer n such that g =
to the power pn is equal to the identity element. Such groups are also =
called primary."=20

I feel we should try to  avoid and even  to reduce  confusion, =
especially as there are claims that crossed modules, for example, can be =
thought of as `2-dimensional groups' (I agree with this, of course!); =
there are nice crossed modules M \to P in which M and P are 2-groups in =
the group theoretic sense!=20

My favourite example is=20

\mu: Z_2 \times Z_2 \to Z_4=20

in which Z_4 acts by the twist (of order 2), and \mu maps each factor =
Z_2 injectively into Z_4. This crossed module has non trivial =
k-invariant. I think Johannes Huebschmann first observed this.=20

So an example oriented approach to crossed modules could well need the =
term p-group in its standard group theoretic usage. Some examples of =
finite crossed modules are in=20

R. Brown and C.D. Wensley, `Computation and homotopical applications
of induced crossed modules', J. Symbolic Computation 35 (2003)
59-72.

However I think one can be happy with the well established term =
2-groupoid.=20

I would just like this point to be discussed: terminology is important, =
and confusing an established  use might raise hackles unnecessarily.=20
