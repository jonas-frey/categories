I would like to make a few observations.
If my recollection is right,  during the 1980's the dream of some topos =
theorists=20
(including myself) was to use atomic toposes as generalised =
K(pi,1)-spaces.
The dream has not materialised and it maybe foolish.

Another avenue is to extend Grothendieck Galois theory, since the
fundamental groupoid of a space classifies the covers of that space.
Eduardo Dubuc is presently developing a general theory of Galois =
toposes.
The fundamental Galois topos of a topos E could be defined as the=20
reflection E--->E(1) of E into the full subcategory of Galois toposes
over the base topos S. I am not supposing that S is the category of =
sets.
I am writing E(1) because I want to suggest that it is a stage of
a Postnikov tower of S-toposes:=20

E(-1)<---E(0)<---E(1)<----E(2)<----

The topos E(-1) is of course the image of the=20
geometric morphisme E-->S. The construction of E(-1)=20
depends on the factorisation system=20

(epimorphisms of toposes, sub-toposes)

The topos E(0) is the totally disconnected localic reflection of E
over the base topos S. Its construction
depends on the factorisation system=20

(connected morphisms of toposes, totally disconnected localic morphisms)

The topos E(1) is the Galois topos reflection of E=20
over the base topos S. Its construction
depends on the factorisation system=20

(1-connected morphisms of toposes, Galois morphisms)


The topos E(2) does not exists in general for the
simple reason that it is a 2-topos, not an ordinary
topos. A 2-topos is enriched over groupoids.
=20
The whole theory depends on three factorisation systems=20

(epimorphisms of toposes, sub-toposes)
(connected morphisms of toposes, totally disconnected localic morphisms)
(1-connected morphisms of toposes, Galois morphisms)

The first factorisation system is well known and=20
was constructed a long time ago.

Excuse my ignorance, but I do not know if the=20
second factorisation system has been fully constructed.=20
Can someone tell me?

The third factorisation system was partially
constructed by Dubuc: he can factor
the morphism E-->S when S is the category of sets.

My observations concerning your problems
could be off the mark.


Best,
Andr=E9

This is precisely where the construction falls down for a =
non-semilocally
1-connected space. If we restrict to looking at the automorphisms as a =
point
(which supposedly form a topological group) the multiplication in the =
group
pi_1 x pi_1 -> pi_1 (i.e. concatenating equivalence classes of loops) is =
not
continuous in both variables, even though it is separately continuous =
(*).
This can be traced back to the simple fact that the product of a pair of
quotient maps in Top is not necessarily a quotient map. Note that this =
is
the usual product in Top, not the compactly generated product. I presume
there is a similar hitch with locales?

(*) I learned of the non-continuity of the multiplication map from, =
among
other places, the article

J. Brazas, The topological fundamental group and hoop earring spaces, =
2009,
arXiv:0910.3685

which dashes optimistic earlier constructions.


Going back to more general thoughts, given an arbitrary space X, the =
topos
Sh(X) is the classifying topos of some localic groupoid G_X =
(Joyal-Tierney),
which I thought (!) could be interpreted as the fundamental groupoid in =
nice
situations. Here I suppose is my real question: what relation is there
between G_X and the (ordinary) fundamental groupoid Pi_1(X)? I suppose a
test case could be the Warsaw circle W: Pi_1(W) is equivalent to the
discrete groupoid on the set {a,b}, and surely G_W is more than this.

One last question: has anyone studied the relation between (strong) =
shape of
a space X and this localic groupoid G_X?
