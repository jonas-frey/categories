Isabelle's internal logic is not constructive. The existential clause of the
BHK-interpretation is violated so that a consquence of "all unicorns have
horns" is that "some unicorn has a horn". The moral (biased towards
theorists): software engineering considerations are not enough, a coherant
philosophy of mathematics is also needed.
