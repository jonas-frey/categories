A note concerning the possibility of constructing the Dedekind reals with=
out
fullness, etc:
the Dedekind reals can be defined in constructive set theory  even withou=
t
excluded middle, power sets, fullness, or countable choice. The point is =
that
they then form a class and not a set.
Class-sized objects are however the norm in a constructive predicative se=
tting.
For instance, a (non-trivial) locale is carried by a class that is never =
a set;
in general a formal space or formal topology is a large object too, so th=
at one
often deals with superlarge "categories" with large homsets.
