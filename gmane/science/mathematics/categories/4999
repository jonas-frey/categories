Not really a contribution to the mathematical question, but I'm struck by
the fact that both Andrew Salch and Andrew Stacey, in their replies to
Steve Vickers, use the plural "skeleta". I used to do that when I was a
student, as a way of winding-up my teachers, but it isn't justifiable.

The English word "skeleton" is indeed derived from a Greek root (the
past participle of the verb "skellein", to wither or dry up), but it
doesn't exist as a noun in Greek. There is therefore no justification
for giving it an imagined Greek plural. Having in my time devoted some
effort to fighting the bogus (but in fact more justifiable) Greek
plural "topoi", I feel bound to protest against this one too.
