Dear Vaughan,

I haven't looked at the programmes, but I mentioned the general drift of
the categories discussion to my wife Dr Camilla Haw. She is a practising
psychiatrist and has also done a lot of research with the Oxford Centre
for Suicide Research. Her comments were (i) academics in general have a
low suicide rate (high rates are for health professionals and
agricultural workers), and (ii) 4 cases over a century or more don't in
themselves add up to risk factor.

Best wishes,

Steve.
