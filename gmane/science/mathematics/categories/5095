I agree. Maybe "merging the effort" wasn't a good choice of words, but
when I saw the wikibook I had the strong impression that there were
similar intentions here to a large piece of the nLab and I thought it
should be useful and easy to transfer content and join forces where
reasonable and desirable.

Yes, that sounds like an interesting idea. Another advantage might be
a greater and easier supply of cross-hyperlinks, either way.

In any case, there are many category-theoretic entries (and not just
those) on the nLab -- existing ones and not-yet existsing ones --
where I would find more textbook-style material highly desireable.

Best,
