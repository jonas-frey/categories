It may be useful to recall the Ehresmann method of setting up the
exponential law for categories using the double categoy of commuting
squares in a category. This is also written up in

 (R.Brown,  P. NICKOLAS), ``Exponential laws for topological
categories,  groupoids and groups and mapping spaces of
colimits'', {\em Cah. Top. G\'eom.  Diff.} 20 (1979) 179-198.

The nice point is that the category structure is induced by a double
category composition, and so if you have extra structure, such as a
topology, that carries over.
