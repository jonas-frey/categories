	The category meeting in Carvoeiro, Portugal held from
June 17th to 23rd, 2007 proved to be one of the most enjoyable
and scientifically promising of the series. This was possible
because of the thoughtful and dedicated organization by
Diana Rodelo, Manuela Sobral, Maria Manuel Clementino, Jorge Picado,
Lourdes Sousa, Gonzalo Gutierres, and Maria Joao Ferreira.
They created a wonderful atmosphere which made possible the
collaboration and friendship between the senior researchers
who were there and the many very intelligent and active young
people, who will be contributing their original research to
future meetings.

	Of course, I was particularly honored by the fact that
the conference banquet took note of my 70th birthday and was
attended by several of my cherished students and colleagues.
I was gratified to meet the many young researchers whom I had not
previously known; they gave me the special gift of hope for the
future of our science.

	My friends and colleagues join me in heartily thanking the
organizers, the scientific committee, and the sponsoring
organizations for having created a most memorable occasion.

	Bill Lawvere
