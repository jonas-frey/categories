Dear Eduardo=2C=0A=
=0A=
This is an addendum to what I have written to Jean Benabou (and Toby Bartel=
s)=2C but referring to your comment. It is not always the case that an equi=
valence F: S^G -> S^K=2C for S a topos=2C and G=2CK small (internal)=A0grou=
pies=2C is induced by an equivalence f:G->K=2C not even by a weak equivalen=
ce functor f:G->K. However=2C given that S^G and S^G are equivalent categor=
ies=2C it follows that the stack completions G' and K' are equivalent. In p=
articular=2C this (the Morita=A0equivalence theorem for internal=A0groupoid=
s=A0in a topos) is an instance where it is necessary to consider=2C not jus=
t wef G->K or K->G=2C but the equivalence relation "G weakly equivalent to =
K".=A0=0A=
