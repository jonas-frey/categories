This thesis concentrates on the development and application of Groebner bases
methods to a range of combinatorial problems (involving groups, semigroups,
categories, category actions, algebras and K-categories).
Chapter Two contains the generalisation of rewriting and 
Knuth-Bendix procedures to Kan extensions.
Chapter Three shows that the standard Knuth-Bendix algorithm is 
step-for-step a special case of the Buchberger's algorithm for noncommutative
Groebner bases. 
The one-sided cases and higher dimensions are considered, and the relations
between these are made precise.
Chapter Four relates rewrite systems, Groebner bases and automata.
Reduction machines for rewrite systems are identified with standard 
output 
automata and the reduction machines devised for algebras are expressed as
Petri-nets.
Chapter Five introduces logged rewriting for group presentations. 
The completion of a logged rewriting system for a group  
determines a partial contracting homotopy which enables the computation 
of a set
of generators for the module of identities among relations using the 
covering 
groupoid methods devised by Brown and Razak Sallah. 
Reducing the resulting set of submodule generators is identified as a
Groebner basis problem.
