I do not see the following paper in the references; would it be worth to
provide a comparison?

Terminal sequences for accessible endofunctors=20
James Worrell

Abstract:

We consider the behaviour of the terminal sequence of an accessible
endofunctor T on a locally presentable category K. The preservation of
monics by T is sufficient to imply convergence, necessarily to a
terminal coalgebra. We can say much more if K is Set, and =CE=BA is =CF=89=
. In
that case it is well known that we do not necessarily get convergence at
=CF=89, however we show that to ensure convergence we don't need to go to=
 a
higher cardinal, just to the next limit ordinal, =CF=89 + =CF=89.

For an =CF=89-accessible endofunctor T on Set the construction of the
terminal coalgebra can thus be seen as a two stage construction, with
each stage being finitary. The first stage obtains the Cauchy completion
of the initial T-algebra as the =CF=89-th object in the terminal sequence=
 A=CF=89.
In the second stage this object is pruned to get the final coalgebra A=CF=
=89
+=CF=89. We give an example where A=CF=89 is the solution of the correspo=
nding
domain equation in the category of complete ultra-metric spaces.



Thanks

Vincenzo
