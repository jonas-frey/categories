// Call for Submissions //

6th Workshop on Games for Logic and Programming Languages
(GaLoP 2011)

// ETAPS 2011 // Saarbr=FCcken, Germany // 26=9627 March //

http://sites.google.com/site/galopws/

GaLoP is an annual workshop on game-semantic models for
logics and programming languages and their applications. This is an
informal workshop that welcomes work in progress, overviews of more
extensive work, programmatic or position papers and tutorials as well as
contributed papers and invited talks.

GaLoP VI will be held in Saarbr=FCcken, Germany, between March 26-27.
It will be part of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice
of Software (ETAPS 2011).

Contributions are invited on all pertinent subjects, with particular
interest in game-semantic and interaction models for logics and
programming languages.

Typical but not exclusive areas of interest are:

    * categorical aspects;
    * algorithmic aspects;
    * programming languages and full abstraction;
    * semantics of logics and proof systems;
    * proof search;
    * higher-order automata;
    * program verification and model checking;
    * program analysis;
    * security;
    * theories of concurrency;
    * probabilistic models;
    * Geometry of Interaction;
    * Ludics.

We particularly encourage submissions in the following related areas of
research:

    * epistemic game theory;
    * logics of dependence and independence;
    * computational linguistics.

There will be no formal proceedings but the possibility of a special
issue in a journal will be considered (selected papers from Galop 2005
and 2008 have appeared in Annals of Pure and Applied Logic).
