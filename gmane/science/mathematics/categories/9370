Dear Vaughan,

I will under the CATLIST and at this point not reply more in detail, but
let me just now say that your "categories are not algebraic in sets, at
least they are algebraic in graphs, which in turn are algebraic in sets"
is within the realm of "algebraic categories". My "Categorizing automata
is hard enough as we see through Budach, Ehrig, Goguen, Manes, Adamek,
etc." is in the realm of "categorical algebra" and monoidal categories.

So with graphs understood as being useful also for representing terms
with "vertices in trees seen as operator names", like it is done e.g. in
tree automata, monoidal categories as underlying categories of term
monads is another view and machinery as compared to dealing with the
category of graphs as an algebraic category ("categories are algebraic
in graphs").

Best,

Patrik
