NEWS

Welcome to the first number of CP News, an initiative of the CP organizing
committee. We aim to provide a comprehensive summary of important news in
the area of constraint programming. The newsletter will be published quarterly
on 1st January, 1st April, 1st July, 1st October. Please email the relevant
editor with any news, event, report or profile you want published. To
subscribe, please visit http://www.math.unipd.it/cp-online/register


The CP organizing committee recently decided that CP-2005 will be held
in Sitges (near Barcelona) October 1st to 5th 2005. The conference will
be co-located with ICLP. Pedro Meseguer and Javier Larrosa will be local
chairs. Peter van Beek will be the program chair. The local organizers
have already arranged for an Annular Solar Eclipse to take place in Spain
during the conference.

The CP organizing committee also decided that CP-2006 will be held in
Nantes in 2006. Eric Monfroy and Frederic Benhamou will be the local chairs.

Each year, the CP community has the opportunity to elect two new members
to serve on the CP organizing committe. The committee consists of 10 members:
6 elected members, and 4 members drawn from the current and past local and
program chairs. If you wish to stand in this year's election, please send
your name and a short election statement to the Secretary of the Organizing
Committee, Toby Walsh (tw@4c.ucc.ie) by 1st June 2004. The electronic
elections will be held over the summer and the results announced at CP-2004.

Finally, don't forget. April 19th is the deadline to apply for the
CP 2004 Doctoral Programme .This is a forum held during the CP conference
to give PhD students visibility and an opportunity to discuss research and
career objectives with established researchers. More details at

REPORTS

Eighth International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics.
Program Chairs: Fahiem Bacchus and Peter van Beek. 4-6 January 2004
http://rutcor.rutgers.edu/~amai/aimath04/
The online newsletter contains a full report about this conference, which
featured sessions on constraints, preferences, satisfiability, portfolio
design, and game theory. http://www.math.unipd.it/cp-online/newsletter

PROFILES

The Nantes CP community is composed of researchers from two institutions:
-the CoCoA group (Continuous Constraints and Applications) of the
 University of Nantes (http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/lina/)
-the CD group (Discrete Constraints) of the Ecole des Mines de Nantes
 (http://www.emn.fr/)
These two themes are grouped together in the new CNRS common research
structure: the LINA. All together, this amounts to 13 faculties.
Our main goal is to develop techniques, languages, and tools for
discrete and continuous constraints. A longer profile of the activities
of the Nantes CP community can be found in the online newsletter.
