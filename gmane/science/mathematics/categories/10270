PREFACE

 	Since the last century, a large part of Mathematics is concerned =
with the study of mathematical structures, from groups to fields and =
vector spaces, from lattices to Boolean algebras, from metric spaces to =
topological spaces, from topological groups to Banach spaces.

 	More recently, these structured sets and their transformations =
have been assembled in higher structures, called categories.

 	We want to give a structural overview of these topics, where the =
basic facts of the different theories are unified through the 'universal =
properties' that they satisfy, and their particularities stand out, =
perhaps even more.

 	This book can be used as a textbook for Undergraduate Studies =
and for self-study. It can provide students of Mathematics with a =
unified perspective of subjects which are often kept apart. It is also =
addressed to students and researchers of disciplines having strong =
interactions with Mathematics, like Physics and Chemistry, Statistics, =
Computer Science, Engineering. =20
