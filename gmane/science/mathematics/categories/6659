Dear Peter
We thought of "other" of course. But that word has no agreed on
mathematical definition. Students who think it means "distinct"
will be confused when told that it is a special application of the UMP
that yields the graph of a map as a section of a projection.
(Perhaps best if "self" is a special case of "other" ?)

Sammy always scolded Jon=2C Fred=2C Myles=2C and me that such "helpful"
explanations make difficult the digestion and mathematical use
of simple clear definitions. (I don't think this excludes explanation
in a separate paragraph or footnote).
Bill
