There's a saying about Lefschetz that he "never wrote a valid
proof, and never made a false conjecture". Now it's not an attitude
that want to encourage, but if you have great mathematicians who
are like that (and Lefschetz was not just a good mathematician, but
a great mathematician, without whom a good deal of modern algebraic
geometry would be unimaginable), then this ought to tell us something.

What it tells us is, of course, not easy to formulate: it's an example
that causes severe problems for almost every philosophy of mathematics
that I know. But it ought to stop us saying things of the form
"if we don't do category theory in such and such a way, then it
won't be mathematics at all".

(Of course we'll all keep saying this, because we all have a secret
fear that, if we aren't really careful about what we do, the grown up
mathematicians will kick sand in our face, but that's a
psychological problem and not a mathematical problem.)
