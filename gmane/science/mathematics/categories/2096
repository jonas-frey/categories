NASSLLI-2003
Second North American Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information
http://www.indiana.edu/~nasslli/

June 17-21, 2003, Bloomington, Indiana

NASSLLI '02 Continues North American Summer School Tradition
---------

Following last year's founding of a North American counterpart to the
European Summer School for Logic, Language and Information, this year's
NASSLLI will be at Indiana University. It will again feature a Student
Session where students can network and get feedback on their work -- both
from faculty and student attendees. This CFP solicits submissions to the
student session.

Topics of Interest
-------
The areas of interest are

	Logic -- including work on problems of mathematical or
                 philosophical  interest
	Language -- including descriptive or theoretical work in formal
                 linguistics
	Language and Logic -- applications of logic to natural language
	Language and Computation -- theoretical and empirical work in
                 computational linguistics
	Logic and Computation -- automated theorem-proving and related
                 fields
	Computation -- artificial intelligence or related areas of
                 computer science

Work integrating several of these areas is of particular interest.


Requirements
-----
The Student Session papers should describe original, unpublished
work that has been completed. However, no previously published papers
should be submitted.

All authors must be at the pre-doctoral level; submissions co-authored
by non-students will be discarded.


Format of Submission
-----
Full papers, not to exceed 10 pages, are to be submitted by email as Adobe
Portable Document Files (PDF).  This file must include a separate
identification page including the following pieces of information:

  Title: title of the submission
  First author: firstname lastname
  Address: address of the first author
  ......
  Last author: firstname lastname
  Address: address of the last author
  Short summary: abstract (5 lines)
  Subject area (one or two of): Logic | Language | Computation
  Other Conferences Submitted To:

Neither this identification page, nor any bibliography counts towards the
10 page limit.

Since reviewing will be blind, the body of the paper should omit author
names and addresses. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's
identity (e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991)... ") should be
avoided. It is possible to use instead references like "Smith (1991)
previously showed..."

The PDF of the paper is to be enclosed in an email duplicating the
information on the identification page. Use US Letter paper and LaTeX if
possible; accepted papers will need to be resubmitted without page
numbers.

Please email submissions to John Hale <hale@cogsci.jhu.edu> by MARCH 15th
2003.

NASSLLI '03
-----
At least one author needs to register for NASSLLI '03 in order to be in
the student session. Accepted papers will be available at the Summer
School in the Student Session Proceedings (tentative plans exist for
on-line dissemination as well). One of the authors will give a 20-minute
talk with up to 10 minutes for discussion.

Dates
----

Deadline for submission of papers		: March 15th, 2003
Author notifications				: May 1st, 2003
Revisions in accepted papers due by		: June 1st, 2003
ESSLLI-2003 Student Session			: June 17-21, 2003.
