Dear Michael,
I've received it a couple of days ago. I should write a review for
Zentralblatt math.

I've not yet seen how it applies CT to other sciences - apparently,
string theory does not appear in the book.
It is an introduction to (basic) CT with many examples and exercises
which try to apply the fundamental concepts in other fields.
As far as I've seen, there are many applications to computer science,
with some emphasis on databases. But, I had just a quick glimpse by
now...

All the best,
M
