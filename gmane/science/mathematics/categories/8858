During February, I gave a series of talks based on a paper published ten 
years ago in TAC, called "Topological *-autonomous categories".  While 
preparing the lectures I came on a number of serious defects in that 
paper.  One curious fact is that I mentioned as motivation is a question 
from Andre Joyal whether the results for real and complex topological 
vector spaces were also valid for vector spaces over the p-adic 
completions of the rationals.  But I never addressed that question in the 
paper, let alone solved it.  I have now prepared a paper, "Topological 
*-autonomous categories, revisited" which fixes all the deficiencies and 
also answers Joyal's question (it is valid for all locally compact fields, 
which includes those p-adic completions as well as their finite 
extensions. Similar results hold for the t-adic completions of the Laurent 
series rings Z_p{t}.

The paper is on my web site.
