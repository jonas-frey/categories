Manin is always entertaining but not very careful about what he says.

I agree.  Naturally Bourbaki was in a better situation to make up a
system that would work, since they had the others behind them.  And
still their system did not work in fact.

Russell was more concerned with philosophic issues of logic, but his
touchstone for logic was that it should work!  (He was very clear
about this by 1919, in his Principles Of Mathematical Philosophy.)  He
knew a lot less than Zermelo about what would work for two reasons:
Russell got into it much earlier, and Russell studied math as a
philosopher at Cambridge while Zermelo studied it as a mathematician
with Hilbert in G=F6ttingen and in debates with Poincar=E9.

All these people sought a foundation that would make sense in itself
and would work.  Naturally they had different emphases, partly shaped
by the different resources they could draw on.  Russell, Zermelo, and
G=F6del all read each other (recalling that Russell was 59 years old,
and two decades past his work on logic, when G=F6del published the
incompleteness theorem, and everyone took years absorbing it).

Of course we do not expect to *foresee* extraordinary things.

That is a pretty safe bet.

Yes, there will be progress on all of these things.

I myself am also confident that people will calm down and notice that
axiomatic categorical foundations such as ETCS and CCAF work perfectly
well, in formal terms, and relate much more directly to practice than
any earlier foundations.  One hundred and fifty years of explicitly
foundational thought has made this progress possible.  By now, that
can hardly qualify as "extraordinary"!

best, Colin
