     CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS: CALCO Early Ideas 2013

*******************************************************************

5th International Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science

              CALCO Early Ideas Workshop

                 September 2, 2013

                   Warsaw, Poland

         http://coalg.org/calco13/workshops.html#ei

     Submission deadline for contributions: 27 May 2013

*******************************************************************

CALCO 2013 will be preceded by the CALCO Early Ideas Workshop,
dedicated to presentation of work in progress and original research
proposals. PhD students and young researchers are particularly
encouraged to contribute. Attendance at the workshop is open to all -
it is anticipated that many CALCO conference participants will want to
attend the CALCO Early Ideas workshop (and vice versa).

The CALCO Early Ideas Workshop invites submissions on the same topics
as the CALCO conference: reporting results of theoretical work on the
mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the way these results can
support methods and techniques for software development, as well as
experience with the transfer of the resulting technologies into
industrial practice. The list of topics of particular interest is
shown on the main CALCO 2013 page: http://coalg.org/calco13/.

CALCO Early Ideas presentations will be selected according to
originality, significance, and general interest, on the basis of
submitted 2-page short contributions.  It can be work in progress, a
summary of work submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere, or
work that in some other way might be interesting to the CALCO
audience. A booklet with the accepted short contributions will be
available at the workshop.

Submissions will be handled via EasyChair
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calcoearlyideas2013
The use of LNCS style is strongly encouraged.

After the workshop, authors will have the opportunity to submit a full
10-15 page paper on the same topic. The reviewing will be carried out
by the CALCO Early Ideas PC, with the support of the CALCO PC. The
volume of selected papers will be made available in the arXiv and on
the CALCO pages online. Authors will retain copyright, and are also
encouraged to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere.

http://coalg.org/calco13/workshops.html#ei

There will be a number of student grants available for the CALCO
conference - details shortly to be announced on the webpage.
