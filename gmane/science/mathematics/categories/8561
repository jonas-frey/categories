A question, that if it has a known answer would probably have been settled =
long before electronically searchable media arose, came up in the project a=
=A0 student of mine is working on for his dissertation.=0A=
=0A=
Obviously the coherence theorem for symmetric monoidal categories applies t=
o cartesian monoidal categories.=A0 The question is:=A0 Is there anything b=
etter?=0A=
=0A=
More specifically is anyone aware of (with a citation to where it is proved=
) a coherence theorem asserting a large class of diagrams commute in any ca=
rtesian monoidal category, or giving criteria for their commuting, when the=
=A0 diagrams are made not just prolongations of the monoidal structure maps=
, but also involve projections (or equivalently unique arrows to the termin=
al object 3D monoidal identity) or diagonals.=A0 (If the "or" turns out to =
be exclusive, I'd be happiest for a theorem including diagonals, but not pr=
ojections, since those come up more in my student's work.)=0A=
=0A=
Of course I'd be happy with a modern-style coherence result, characterizing=
  free cartesian monoidal categories, too, since we should be able to read o=
ff the "all-[these] diagrams commute" sort of theorem from it.=0A=
