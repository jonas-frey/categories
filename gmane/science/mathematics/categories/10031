Dear Colleagues,

    please find below the call for papers for the Sixth Symposium on
Compositional Structures which will take place at the University of
Leicester on 16-17 December 2019. Please note the submission deadline is 4
November 2019.
I hope to see many of you in Leicester.

Best wishes,
Simona.



SIXTH SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 6)
-- including a Category Theory PhD Recruitment Fair --???
???
University of Leicester, UK???
     16-17 December, 2019???
???
   http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/syco/6/???
???
The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an???
interdisciplinary series of meetings aiming to support the growing???
community of researchers interested in the phenomenon of???
compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives, and in???
particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language.???
Previous SYCO events have been held at University of Birmingham,???
University of Strathclyde, University of Oxford, and Chapman University.???
???
We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science,???
mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of???
fostering friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading???
knowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature???
research and work in progress, and by both established academics and???
junior researchers, including students.???
???
Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions.???
The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even???
if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. Think creatively---???
you could submit a recent paper, or notes on work in progress, or even???
a recent Masters or PhD thesis.???
???
While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions???
with a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in???
particular from the perspective of category theory:???
???
- logical methods in computer science, including classical and???
quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language???
processing and machine learning;???
???
- graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and???
reaction networks;???
???
- languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets,???
type theory and game semantics;???
???
- abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal???
category theory, higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and???
relationships to homotopy theory;???
???
- quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation???
theory;???
???
- tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof???
assistants, and game theory;???
???
- industrial applications, including case studies and real-world???
problem descriptions.???
???
This new series aims to bring together the communities behind many???
previous successful events which have taken place over the last???
decade, including "Categories, Logic and Physics", "Categories, Logic???
and Physics (Scotland)", "Higher-Dimensional Rewriting and???
Applications", "String Diagrams in Computation, Logic and Physics",???
"Applied Category Theory", "Simons Workshop on Compositionality", and???
the "Peripatetic Seminar in Sheaves and Logic".???
???
SYCO is a regular fixture in the academic calendar, running???
regularly throughout the year, and becoming over time a recognized???
venue for presentation and discussion of results in an informal and???
friendly atmosphere. To help create this community, and to avoid the???
need to make difficult choices between strong submissions, in the???
event that more good-quality submissions are received than can be???
accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose to???
*defer* some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject them.???
This would be done based largely on submission order, giving an???
incentive for early submission, but would also take into account other???
requirements, such as ensuring a broad scientific programme. Deferred???
submissions can be re-submitted to any future SYCO meeting, where they???
would not need peer review, and where they would be prioritised for???
inclusion in the programme. This will allow us to ensure that speakers???
have enough time to present their ideas, without creating an???
unnecessarily competitive reviewing process. Meetings will be held???
sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.???

# INVITED SPEAKERS???
???
Gabriella Bohm, Wigner Research Centre for Physics???
Jennifer Hackett, University of Nottingham???
???
# PhD RECRUITMENT FAIR???
???
This event will include a poster session advertising PhD opportunities???
in category theory and related disciplines. If you are interested in???
advertising PhD opportunities at your institution, please email Simona???
Paoli at <sp424@leicester.ac.uk>. We expect significant participation???
from Masters students and final-year undergraduates who are???
considering further study in this area.???
