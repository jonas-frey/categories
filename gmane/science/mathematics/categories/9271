PhD Studentship: Automated Verification through Coalgebras
**********************************************************************
University of Southampton - Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering


Qualification type: PhD

Location: Southampton, UK

Funding for: UK students, EU students

Funding amount: EU/UK fees and stipend in line with EPSRC rates

Hours: Full Time

Deadline for applications: 4th August 2017
=20
PhD Supervisor: Corina Cirstea

Project Description:

As part of this project, you will work on developing new foundations for =
quantitative verification, grounded in the theory of coalgebras.

Coalgebras are mathematical structures suited for modelling a large =
variety of state-based, dynamical systems, with features such as =
non-deterministic, stochastic, or weighted behaviour being uniformly =
captured in the models. Coalgebras come with modal and temporal logics =
that expressively support reasoning about the temporal behaviour of =
dynamical systems, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Owing to the =
diversity of semantic models that can be captured, coalgebra is the =
ideal framework for modelling and reasoning about heterogeneous systems =
whose components have different quantitative verification concerns.

During your PhD, you will help build a synergy between the fields of =
coalgebraic methods and automated verification, and will publish at =
internationally leading conferences and journals. Your project will =
contribute to the development of a new research area of coalgebraic =
model checking, aimed on the one hand at unifying existing quantitative =
model checking techniques, and on the other at extending the =
applicability of such techniques to complex systems, whose modelling =
requires a variety of underlying models. Application areas for such =
techniques include, but are not limited to: cloud computing, with a need =
for analyzing the efficiency of resource-management operations; =
industrial control systems, with a need for energy-aware controller =
synthesis; and cyber security, with a need for resource-aware reasoning =
about system-attacker interactions.

More details about the project can be found here: =

rough-coalgebras/

Candidate profile:

 	=E2=80=A2 good undergraduate degree in mathematics or computer =
science (required),
 	=E2=80=A2 interest in theoretical computer =
science/logic/automated verification (required),
 	=E2=80=A2 good programming skills (desirable).

For further details about the project, please contact Dr Corina Cirstea =
(cc2@ecs.soton.ac.uk).

Application process: To apply, please email your CV, transcript of your =
degree and a brief statement of research interests to =
cc2@ecs.soton.ac.uk.
