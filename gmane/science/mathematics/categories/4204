Hi Jeff,

I don't know about locales, but I worked on issues surrounding taking a
uniform space, and forgetting the uniformity but keeping the set of cauchy
filters.  This turns out to be a nontrivial amount of forgetting.  I liked
the result because the resulting category, which I call the category of
completable spaces, can be used as a base category and, for example, if
you have a commutative ring, you can look at the compatible
completabilities on it (making it a completable space with the
discrete completability) and they generalize the valuations on a field.
