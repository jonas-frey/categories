Dear colleagues,

I invite applications for two postdoctoral position, starting early in
2017 (ideally in January or February), at Dalhousie University under
my supervision.

The successful applicants will work on a project entitled "Trusted
Quantum Software via a Formally Verified Functional Quantum
Programming Language". Specifically, the project involves the design
and semantics of a functional programming language for quantum
computing, loosely modelled on the Quipper language
(http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/). It will also involve
developing the meta-theory of the language, and eventually the
formalization of some of this meta-theory in a proof assistant. The
research project is part of a team effort, also involving
collaborators from Tulane, Stanford, Oxford, the University of Iowa,
and the University of Pennsylvania.

Familiarity with type theory, programming language design, and/or
semantics (including categorical semantics) will be a prerequisite for
these postdocs. Familiarity with quantum computing will be helpful,
but is neither necessary nor sufficient for this position - the main
emphasis is on programming languages and type systems.

The positions are initially for 1 year, and can be extended for an
additional year. The salary is $50,000 Canadian per year plus benefits.

Two positions are available:

* Postdoc 1 is funded by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific
   Research. The postdoc will be held in the Department of Mathematics
   and Statistics at Dalhousie University.

* Postdoc 2 is funded by Rigetti Computing, a quantum computing
   startup based in Berkeley, California (rigetti.com).  The postdoc
   position is formally known as the "Rigetti Computing Prize
   Fellowship". The postdoc will be held in the Department of
   Mathematics and Statistics at Dalhousie University, but the
   applicant will be expected to spend three months per year on site at
   Rigetti Computing office in Berkeley to work on Rigetti projects
   related to quantum computing.

Interested applicants should contact Peter Selinger at
selinger@mathstat.dal.ca as soon as possible, and in any case before
January 10. I can provide more details about the research project to
interested applicants on request.

Thanks, -- Peter
