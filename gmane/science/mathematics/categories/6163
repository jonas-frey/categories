Yes, as far as that category of partitions is concerned. But note my
last sentence:

Perhaps I should have put the emphasis differently: for a proper
quotient of a non-partition, choose the canonical map (its range is a
partition); for a quotient of a partition, use the union construction.
Of course the case distinction is somewhat unsatisfactory, and so I
was trying to hint that there would be a nicer solution if all sets
were partitions in the first place.

It might be worth mentioning that a similar idea serves to equip the
very category of sets with a (binary-)product functor to make it
strictly monoidal.
