Dear Colleagues,

   I have posted today on ArXiv the last of a series of four recent preprint=
s on my work on weakly globular n-fold categories. This is a new Segal-type=
  model of weak n-categories which is suitably equivalent to the Tamsamani-S=
impson model but which offers several novel features as it is based on iter=
ated internal categories.

I thought of informing you of this work on this mailing list because, due t=
o conflicting scientific commitments, I was unfortunately unable to attend =
the international category theory conference last August.

The references are as follows, and if you have any comments please write to=
  me at simona.paoli@virgilio.it  or at sp424@le.ac.uk
