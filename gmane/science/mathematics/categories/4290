Augmenting Steve Awodey's reply to M. Shulman I want to mention
a further possibility which is more in the spirit of type / category
theory, namely that of universes in toposes as described in my
article with the same title (available under
(www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/NOTES/UniTop.ps.gz).

It is essentially a catgorical variant of Martin-Loef's notion
of universe albeit an impredicative one. It was used a lot
in categorical semantics of type theory (starting ~1985)
but certainly part of the categorical folklore. The first
written account I know of is Jean B'enabou's "Probl`emes
dans le topos" from 1973. His main example that time was
decidable K-finite objects in a topos with nno.

A universe in a topos EE is a pullback stable class SS
of morphism admitting a generic element in SS, i.e. a
map E -> U in SS from which all other maps in SS can be obtained
via pullback. Replacement is modelled by the requirement that
SS be closed under composition. Of course, one usually requires
more further closure properties (as in type theory).

In the above mentioned paper I have shown that all Grothendieck
and realizability toposes admit such universes (exploiting
Grothendieck universes on the meta-level).

As far as I can see universes serve well the purpose of replacement
in mathematics, namely defining families of types by recursion.
They achieve this goal in a more direct way than replacement does.
The reason why they are presumably weaker than the setting Steve
mentioned is that one needs a type-theoretic collection axiom
(as in Joyal and Moerdijk's "Algebraic Set Theory") besides W-types
for constructing set theoretic universes from type theoretic ones.

I don't know why universes have hardly been considered in topos theory.
(One notable exception being B'enabou's calibrations giving notions of
size when considering locally small fibrations.) I think they are most
useful and actually indispensible for doing category theory in the
internal language of a topos.

Algebraic Set Theory is an instance of universes, namely universes
within categories modelling first order logic.
