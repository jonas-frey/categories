My apologies to Eduardo.  I misread his original post as a complaint
about AG, when what he meant was that there was no ambiguity given that
the other interpretations made little or no sense.

Since complaining about AG makes little sense on a list AG (presumably)
doesn't read, when there was another interpretation that would have made
more sense had I noticed it, I'm guilty of the very thing Eduardo was
complaining about.
