I've assumed (and told people) that "topos" was a back-formation from
"topology" - that Grothendieck's intention was to imply that toposes
were the structures of which topology was truly the study. (The argument
falls into two parts: (a) to carry out topology you need sheaves and not
just opens, and (b) there are suitable categories of sheaves that don't
arise from ordinary spaces.)

Certainly it is my own intention to stress the "generalized topological
space" nature of toposes; but is my assumption about Grothendieck's
intention actually correct?
