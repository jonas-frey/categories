CALL FOR PAPERS
ARRAY 2019

6th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on=20
Libraries, Languages and Compilers for Array Programming
co-located with PLDI 2019 at ACM FCRC
22nd June 2019, Phoenix, Arizona
https://pldi19.sigplan.org/


ABOUT

Array-oriented programming offers a unique blend of programmer =
productivity and high-performance parallel execution. As an abstraction, =
it directly mirrors high-level mathematical constructions commonly used =
in many fields from natural sciences over engineering to financial =
modelling. As a language feature, it exposes regular control flow, =
exhibits structured data dependencies, and lends itself to many types of =
program analysis. Furthermore, many modern computer architectures, =
particularly highly parallel architectures such as GPUs and FPGAs, lend =
themselves to efficiently executing array operations.

This workshop is intended to bring together researchers from many =
different communities, including language designers, library developers, =
compiler researchers and practitioners who are using or working on =
numeric, array-centric aspects of programming languages, libraries and =
methodologies from all domains: imperative or declarative; =
object-oriented or functional; interpreted or compiled; strongly typed, =
weakly typed or untyped.


TOPICS

The ARRAY series of workshops explores:

- formal semantics and design issues of array-oriented languages and =
libraries;

- productivity and performance in compute-intensive application areas of =
array programming;

- systematic notation for array programming, including axis- and =
index-based approaches;

- intermediate languages, virtual machines, and program-transformation =
techniques for array programs;

- representation of and automated reasoning about mathematical =
structure, such as static and dynamic sparsity, low-rank patterns, and =
hierarchies of these, with connections to applications such as graph =
processing, HPC, tensor computation and deep learning;

- interfaces between array- and non-array code, including approaches for =
embedding array programs in general-purpose programming languages; and

- efficient mapping of array programs, through compilers, libraries, and =
code generators, onto execution platforms, targeting multi-cores, SIMD =
devices, GPUs, distributed systems, and FPGA hardware, by fully =
automatic and user-assisted means.

Array programming is at home in many communities, including language =
design, library development, optimization, scientific computing, and =
across many existing language communities. ARRAY is intended as a forum =
where these communities can exchange ideas on the construction of =
computational tools for manipulating arrays.


IMPORTANT DATES

Paper submissions: 8th April, 2019 (anywhere on earth)

Notification of authors: 27th April, 2019

Camera-ready copies due: 10th May, 2019

Workshop date: 22nd June, 2019


SUBMISSIONS

Submissions are welcome in two categories: full papers and extended =
abstracts. All submissions should be formatted in conformance with the =
ACM SIGPLAN proceedings style. Accepted submissions in either category =
will be presented at the workshop.

Full papers may be up to 12pp, on any topic related to the focus of the =
workshop. They will be thoroughly reviewed according to the usual =
criteria of relevance, soundness, novelty, and significance; accepted =
submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library.

Extended abstracts may be up to 2pp; they may describe work in progress, =
tool demonstrations, and summaries of work published in full elsewhere. =
The focus of the extended abstract should be to explain why the proposed =
presentation will be of interest to the ARRAY audience. Submissions will =
be lightly reviewed only for relevance to the workshop, and will not =
published in the DL.=20

Whether full papers or extended abstracts, submissions must be in PDF =
format, printable in black and white on US Letter sized paper. Papers =
must adhere to the standard SIGPLAN conference format: two columns, =
nine-point font on a ten-point baseline, with columns 20pc (3.33in) wide =
and 54pc (9in) tall, with a column gutter of 2pc (0.33in). A suitable =
document template for LaTeX is available at =
http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/.

Papers must be submitted using EasyChair: =
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Darray2019.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date of full papers is the =
date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This =
date may be up to two weeks prior to the workshop. The official =
publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to =
published work.
