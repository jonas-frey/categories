Dear Andrej,

It seems to me that the monad-on-a-category freely generated by one
object should be the simplicial category Delta, following from the facts
that Delta contains the universal monoid and a monad on C is a monoid in
C^C - see Mac Lane Cats for Working Mathematician Section VII.5, VII.6.
The object n of Delta will correspond to T^n(X) where T is the (functor
for the) monad and X the generating object. If I've got that right then
I would presume it's already known and proved carefully somewhere.

After that, the monad-on-a-category freely generated by a category C
would seem to be CxDelta. (Object (X,n) represents T^n(X), morphism
(f,s): (X,m) -> (Y,n) corresponds to T^m(f);s(Y): T^m(X) -> T^m(Y) ->
T^n(Y) and using naturality of T to deduce that s(Y);T^n(g) =
T^m(g);s(Z) so the f's can always be shunted to the left.) Again, if
I've got that right then it wouldn't surprise me to find it's already known.

This would suggest that C |-> CxDelta is a monad on Cat. Then a monad on
C is a structure morphism CxDelta -> C, i.e. Delta -> C^C with
appropriate properties, which looks like a monoid in C^C, which we knew
already.

I don't know Knuth-Bendix well enough to understand the issues there.
But since you mention various orderings, that reminds me of Freyd's
trick in "essentially algebraic" presentations of these cartesian
theories. (Amongst theories of partial operators, it is the cartesian
theories that have good universal algebraic properties.) That involves
ordering the operators so that, for each one, its domain of definition
is defined by equations involving "earlier" operators. (Ultimately that
comes down to total operators, for which no equations are needed.) Then
the equations s = t are understood in the sense "if s and t are both
defined, then they are equal". I don't know if that can be accommodated
in Knuth-Bendix as it stands. In particular, I don't know how amenable
K-B is to incorporating conditional rewrites. Conditional equations seem
inevitable in cartesian theories; the essentially algebraic formulation
reduces them to definedness explicitly conditional on equations, and
equations implicitly conditional on definedness. You might want to look
at my paper with Palmgren, which unifies them by identifying definedness
with self-equality.

You ask whether a free "monad on a category" is the same as a "free
monad" on "free category". Of course, in using the word "free" one ought
to be careful what kind of structure these are free over, but generally
speaking if the forgetful functors compose then so will their left
adjoints, the free functors.

Best wishes,

Steve.
