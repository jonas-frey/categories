      The Foundations of Global Computing - Trinity College Dublin
                       Two PhD studentships

Applications are invited for two PhD studentships within the Software
Systems Lab of the Department of Computer Science. The positions are
part of a SFI-funded research project, under the direction of Matthew
Hennessy, which seeks to establish a firm mathematical and logical
basis for the next generation of widely distributed computing
environments.

  The research programme within the project is wide ranging in scope,
offering considerable flexibility to the successful candidates to
pursue particular research interests. These range from the design and
investigation of abstract calculi for describing the behaviour of
complex systems, the use of types to enforce security policies, to the
development of verification technologies for ensuring properties of
mobile agents.

Qualification requirements:

Applicants should have at least a good honours primary degree in
Computer Science or Mathematics, and have a proven aptitude in
discrete mathematics and the manipulation of formal systems.

Remuneration:

17,000 euros per annum, plus postgraduate fees, for three years,
starting in October 2009.

Application details:

Interested applicants should, in the first instance, send their CV to
the address below, together with a statement outlining their
suitability for the project and the names of two
referees. Applications by email are welcome.
