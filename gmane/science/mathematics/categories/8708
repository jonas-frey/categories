Dear all,

There is a three-year postdoc position available at the ILLC, which is part
of the University of Amsterdam. The deal is that applicants should also
submit a proposal for a VENI-grant with NWO, the Dutch Science
Organization, and should get a favorable review. This implies that only
people who are eligible for the VENI can apply, which for most applicants
means that they must have obtained their PhD in 2013, 2014 or 2015. The
deadline for the application for the postdoc position is 1 November 2015,
while the deadline for the VENI-application is 5 January 2016. More
information is available here:

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Best,

Benno
