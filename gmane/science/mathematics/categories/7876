A three-year postdoctoral position is available under the direction
of Bartek Klin in the Institute of Informatics, University of Warsaw.

The position is in the field of semantics of programming languages
and process algebras, within the project

"Modular operational semantics: a bialgebraic approach",

funded by the Polish National Science Center. The applicants should have
(or be close to completion of) a PhD degree in Mathematics or Computer
Science, and be interested in topics such as semantics of programming
languages, process algebra, formal methods, and/or category theory.

The position is available from November 2013, but the starting date may
be postponed on request of a suitable candidate.

In addition, interested candidates are invited to apply for a postdoctoral
fellowship at the Warsaw Center of Mathematics and Computer Science
(http://www.wcmcs.edu.pl/node/41), with the rather short deadline of

*** October 15th, 2013 ***.

These are one-year positions (with a possible extension to two years),
with an excellent salary which may be used as an additional source of
funding for the first years of stay in Warsaw.

For further information please contact Bartek Klin (klin@mimuw.edu.pl).
