Hi Takuo,

thanks for that observation, it's rather nice way to put it.

Aaron Mazel-Gee had another way to show it, which he shared with me
privately, and gave me permission to pass on to the list, copied
below.

It turns out that there are two diagrams that prove the result about
symmetric monoidal functors (if one takes an elementary approach, and
not using strictification, as Joyal=E2=80=93Street do in the published
'Braided tensor categories'), which are two halves of the generalised
resultoassociahedron on the middle of page 39 of
http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~street/BatanAustMSMq.pdf, originally
appearing in work of Bar-Natan in 1993 (or so, it's a little hard to
recognise). If one categorified this result, then one could have a
3-arrow that filled this polyhedral diagram of 2-arrows.

>(1') In particular, for any pair of objects A,B=E2=88=88CAlg(V), one might=
  write A=E2=8A=A0B=E2=88=88CAlg(V) for their coproduct.

>(2) Using the notation (1'), for any A,B=E2=88=88CAlg(V), there is a canon=
ical enhancement of the multiplication map A=E2=8A=A0A --> A from a morphis=
m in V to a morphism in CAlg(V).

>(3) For any =E2=88=9E-operad O, note the existence of a forgetful functor =
CAlg(V) --> Alg_O(V).



>Now, take V to be the (2,1)-category Cat, equipped with the cartesian symm=
etric monoidal structure.  Then, an E_=E2=88=9E-algebra in V is nothing mor=
e or less than a symmetric monoidal category C.  By (2), the symmetric mono=
idal product C x C --> C admits a canonical enhancement to a symmetric mono=
idal functor.  And if you like, you can apply (3) with O=3DE_2.
