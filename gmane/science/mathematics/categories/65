The trouble with the Conway construction is not that it's non-
constructive, but that it isn't (in any reasonable sense) a
construction of the reals. If you stop it at the point when it
finally constructs the real numbers 1/3, \sqrt{2}, \pi and so
on, then it has also succeeded in constructing lots of non-real
numbers like \omega, 1/\omega, 1/2-1/\omega and so on. So how
do you distinguish the numbers you want from the ones you don't?

I did, in both my first Topos Theory book and the Elephant, borrow
Conway's recursive definition of multiplication to give a
constructively valid definition of multiplication for Dedekind reals.
I'm not aware of anyone else who has done that; but it seems to
me the only intellectually respectable way to do it.
