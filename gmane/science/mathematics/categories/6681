As I recall, tho' it's a fallible memory by now 4 decades or more old,
the enrichedness of the left adjoint in an adjunction that starts with =

an enriched functor in the first place follows automatically in the event=

that V's underlying-set functor is faithful, i.e., that the unit object =

for the internal hom-functor [-,-] is a generator.

Seems to me I probably have that in an old SLNM proceedings volume -- not=

# 80, I'd think, but maybe # 99, or not much later.

HTH, and that I'm not mistaken, -- Fred =
