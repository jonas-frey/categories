                              CALL FOR PAPERS

                           IEEE Computer Society
            1998 International Conference on Computer Languages

                             Loyola University
                       Chicago, USA, 14-16 May, 1998

                      (http://www.math.luc.edu/iccl98)

Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Computer
Languages, in cooperation with ACM Special Interest Group on Programming
Languages.

This is the sixth in a series of conferences devoted to all aspects of
computer languages, serving to bring together people broadly interested in
machine processable descriptions.  The hallmarks of ICCL are diversity,
openness to a wide range of linguistic research, and international
representation.  The focus is on new ideas in languages and language
technology which are innovative or experimental in nature.  Papers are
sought that describe significant new theoretical or experimental results in
the design, evaluation or implementation of programming/specification
languages.  Areas of particular interest include but are not limited to:

  *  Implementation/optimization 
  *  Theory/semantics 
  *  Abstract interpretation/Flow Analysis 
  *  Partial evaluation 
  *  Parallel/distributed languages 
  *  Object-oriented languages 
  *  Functional/logic languages 
  *  Multiparadigm languages 
  *  Real-time/fault-tolerant languages 
  *  Requirements/design/specification languages 
  *  Internet programming languages 
  *  Domain-specific languages 

Papers should be at most 20 double-spaced pages in length, should have an
abstract of approximately 250 words, and a separate cover page indicating
the title, authors, and a list of keywords.  Papers will be judged on the
basis of their relevance, significance, originality, correctness, and
clarity.  Accepted papers will appear in a full proceedings published by
the IEEE Computer Society Press, for which authors will be expected to sign
a copyright release form.

Papers may be submitted electronically by sending an e-mail containing a
platform-independent postscript file (which can be printed on A4 and/or on
8.5"x11" paper) to the address iccl98@csc.ncsu.edu, or by sending 5 copies
of papers to Purush Iyer, program committee co-chair, at the address below.
Submissions should be accompanied by a cover letter that includes a return
mailing address, telephone number and email address.  The papers are due by
OCT 1, 1997.  Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by
JAN 20, 1998.  Camera ready versions of accepted papers will be due
FEB 15, 1998.

On the day prior to the Conference, a workshop on internet programming
languages is being planned by Henri Bal (bal@cs.vu.nl) and Boumediene
Belkhouche (bb@eecs.tulane.edu); details for this and other pre-Conference
activities will be publicized in a separate announcement and are also
available at http://www.math.luc.edu/iccl98.
