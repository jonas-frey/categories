We are pleased to announce two special events that will be held in =20
2007, in Italy and France respectively, in honour of Jean-Yves =20
Girard, who celebrates his 60th birthday this year:

*************************

Workshop on
Linear Logic, Ludics, Implicit Complexity and Operator Algebras.
Dedicated to Jean-Yves  Girard on his 60th birthday.

University of Siena (Italy) at the Certosa di Pontignano, May 17-20, =20
2007.

Organizing committee:  Michele Abrusci (Roma III), Claudia Faggian =20
(CNRS - Paris 7), Simone Martini (Bologna), Simona Ronchi Della Rocca =20=

(Torino), Aldo Ursini (Siena, chair)

*************************

and


*************************

Journ=E9es Jean-Yves Girard
Conference in honour of his 60th birthday

Institut Henri Poincar=E9, Paris, September 10 and 11, 2007

Organizing committee: Michele Abrusci (Roma III) Pierre-Louis Curien =20
(CNRS - Paris 7, chair), Martin Hyland (Cambridge), Giuseppe Longo =20
(ENS, Paris), Mitsu Okada (Keio U., Tokyo), Phil Scott (Univ. of =20
Ottawa), Jacqueline Vauzeilles (Paris 13, co-chair)

*************************

Both events will be an occasion to celebrate Jean-Yves Girard's deep =20
achievements in Mathematics and in Computer Science, and the =20
pervasive influence of his ideas in those disciplines and beyond.

The Siena workshop also celebrates the 20th anniversary of the =20
completion of his
fundamental paper on Linear Logic. The aim is to gather people =20
working in the
many research streams originating from Girard's main achievements of =20
the recent years. For each of the four main themes---Linear Logic =20
(specifically, Proof Nets and Geometry of Interaction), Ludics, =20
Implicit Complexity and Operator Algebras---there will be in-depth =20
lectures (3 to 4 hours), with emphasis on the state of the art and =20
prospects for future development. There will also be some time for 30-=20=

minute contributed papers and for discussion of general perspectives =20
and philosophical foundations.

This workshop has been organized to complement the celebration in =20
Paris, which will take place immediately after Jean-Yves' birthday. =20
Through our choice of invited speakers, we hope  to illustrate  the =20
wide range of scientific interests of Jean-Yves Girard over thirty-=20
five years, from  the complexity of proofs to quantum mechanics, from =20=

system F to the geometry of computation, from denotational semantics =20
to Von Neumann algebras.

The two web sites will provide all details.
