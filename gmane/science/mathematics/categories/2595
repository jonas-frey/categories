Dear Vaughan,

I like it!

But there's still the question of just what structure the power set has.
Constructively it's not a Boolean algebra in general, though it is a frame.

And is it even a set? You can in fact only say that by removing the
structure, which is exactly what you told the set-theorists not to do.
And in this instance it's arguable. Topos theorists say it is a set,
predicative type theorists say it isn't.

Part of the structure of the power "set" is topological - the Scott
topology, with the inclusion order as its specialization order. But to
formalize it as topological space, point-set + topological structure,
you again have to forget structure in order to get a point-set. Taking
this seriously generally brings you to point-free topology in some form
or other.

Steve Vickers.
