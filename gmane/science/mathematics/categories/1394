... about adding slogans:
"there is no mathematics without structures"
and
"there are no structures without transformations (between structures)"

In stating this, I would go back to (Gauss and) Reimann (and Klein).  
 This was a turning point of last century mathematics.  Geometry is  
the analysis of (possibly) curved space and the unity of geometries  
is found on the notion of transformation (over manifolds, say:  
continuous, differentiable ...).
Mathematics is no more found (only) on "quantities", since ratios of  
length and of angles, at the heart of Euclidean geometry, are not  
preserved in non-euclidean frames (their group of automorphisms are  
not closed under omotheties).

Category Theory is the theory which inherited this fantastic  
broadening of perspective.
