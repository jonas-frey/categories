Would the following (aside from the first) help to prepare a more
digestible proof of Barr's full regular embedding theorem?

1) Say that an object U of a (but not just any) category E is open if U
   is a finitely presentable object of the opposite of E (i.e., if it
   satisfies the analogue of the filter convergence characterization
   of open sets). An object P of E is strict if it is the projective
   limit of a diagram of opens such that each limit projection is an
   effective epimorphism; P is called saturated if for every U -->> V
   of opens, each P -->> V lifts to some P -->> U; finally, P is called
   weakly projective if it is projective with respect to effective
   epimorphisms of opens. Every strict, saturated object is  weakly
   projective.   
2) Given P in Pro(C), where C is a regular category, let P' denote the
   fibred product of all X -->> P which are opens of Pro(C)/P, and P*
   the projective limit of: P <<-- P' <<-- P'' <<-- P''' ...; one
   shows that the projection P* --> P is an effective epimoprhism, that 
   P* is a strict, saturated object of Pro(C)/P, and therefore that P*
   is a weakly projective object of Pro(C). Theorem 14 of Barr's '86
   JPAA paper (i.e., step three in his message of 21 May) applies.
3) The construction is (to my knowledge) due to Joyal (c. 1972, or
   earlier). Objects of the form X*, where X is an object of C, are 
   principal prime models, a notion Makkai (Full continuous embeddings
   of toposes, Trans AMS, 1982) distilled from Barr's original proof
   (Joyal called them absolutely flasque).

PS:Without the terminology, that Pro(C) (=~ Lex(C,Set)^op) is regular 
   if C is is suggested in SGA4, Expose I, 8.9 (especially cf. exercise
   8.9.9(b)).
