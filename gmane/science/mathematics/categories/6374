Call for papers:
           A special Issue of Mathematical Structure in Computer Science on
           "Partial Combinatory Algebras in Realizability and Computability"

Notice of intention to submit:
           Deadline: January 2011

Submission:
           Deadline: April 30, 2011
           Special editors: Pieter Hofstra (phofstra@uottawa.ca) and
                                    Robin Cockett (robin@cpsc.ucalgary.ca)

Background:
            Following the July 9th (2010)  LICS  workshop on PCAs,
realizability,
            and computability
(http://www.floc-conference.org/PCARC-home.html),
            we are now accepting and soliciting papers for a special
issue of MSCS on
            the general topic of that workshop.

Constraints:
            * Submission is open to both participants and to those who
               could not/did not attend.
            * Submissions should be on a topic related to the workshop.
               Survey and overview papers will also be considered.
            * If you intend to submit a paper please do let us know as soon
               as possible but certainly by the new year: this will
greatly facilitate
               our planning.
            * The papers will be refereed in the usual manner of a
               journal submission.

Subject area:
            * All aspects of (partial) combinatory logic and lambda calculi
            * Partial combinatory algebras, models of computation, and
generalizations
            * Categorical and type theoretic aspects of computability
            * Realizability.

If you have questions please do not hesitate to contact one of the editors.
