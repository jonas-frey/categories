When one defines, say, a group =E0 la Borbaki, i.e. structurally, it usua=
lly goes
without saying that the defined structure is defined up to isomorphism. T=
he
notion of isomorphism plays in this case the role similar to that of equa=
lity
in the (naive) arithmetic. In most structural constexts the distinction b=
etween
the "same" structure and isomorphic structures is mathematically trivial =
just
like the distinction between the "same" number and equal numbers. It may =
be not
specially discussed in this case exactly because it is very basic. The no=
tion
of admissible map, say, that of group homomorphism, on the contrary, requ=
ires a
definition, which may be non-trivial.
The idea to do mathematics up to isomorphism is not Bourbaki's invention;=
 it
goes back at least to Hilbert's "Grundlagen der Geometrie" of 1899. In th=
is
sense the modern axiomatic method is structuralist. In his often-quoted l=
etter
to Frege Hilbert explicitely says that a theory is "merely a framework" w=
hile
domains of their objects are multiple and transform into each other by
"univocal and reversible one-one transformations". Those who trace the hi=
story
of mathematical structuralism back to Hilbert are quite right, in my view=
.
I have in mind two issues related to CT, which suggest that CT goes in a
*different* direction - in spite of the fact that MacLane and many other
workers in CT had (and still have) structuralist motivations. The first i=
s
Functorial Semantics, which brings a *category* of models, not just one m=
odel
up to isomorphism. From the structuralist viewpoint the presence of
non-isomorphic models (i.e. non-categoricity) is a shortcoming of a given
theory. From the perspective of Functorial Semantics it is a "natural" fe=
ature
of mathematical theories to be dealt with rather than to be remedied.
The second thing I have in mind is Sketch theory. I cannot see that Hilbe=
rt's
basic structuralist intuition applies in this case. In my understanding t=
hings
work in Sketch theory more like in Euclid. Think about circle and straigh=
t line
as a sketch of the theory of the first four books of Euclid's "Elements".=
 I
would particularly appreciate, Michael, your comment on this point since =
I
learnt a lot of Sketch theory from your works.
I have also a comment about the idea to rewrite Bourbaki's "Elements" fro=
m a new
categorical viewpoint. Bourbaki took Euclid's "Elements" as a model for h=
is
work just like did Hilbert writing his "Gundlagen". In my view, this is t=
his
long-term Euclidean tradition of "working foundations", which is worth to=
 be
saved and further developed, in particular in a categorical setting. I'm =
less
sure that Bourbaki's example should be followed in a more specific sense.
Bourbaki tries to cover too much - and doesn't try to distinguish between=
 what
belongs to foundations and what doesn't. As a result the work is too long=
 and
not particularly usefull for (early) beginners. I realise that today's
mathematics unlike mathematics of Euclid's time is vast, so it is more
difficult to present its basics in a concentrated form. But consider Hilb=
ert's
"Grundlagen". It covers very little - actually near to nothing - of geome=
try of
its time. But at the same time it provided a very powerful model of how t=
o do
mathematics in a new way, which greatly influenced mathematics education =
and
mathematical research in 20th century. In my view, Euclid's "Elements" an=
d
Hilbert's "Grundlagen" are better examples to be followed.

best,
andrei
