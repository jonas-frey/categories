I'm surprised that no-one has yet replied to David's original question
by citing the work of Marta Bunge; she has a paper called (I think)
"Classifying toposes and fundamental localic groupoids" dating from the
early 1990s. (Being away from home at present, I don't have the exact
reference to hand; I was hoping Marta would provide it.)
