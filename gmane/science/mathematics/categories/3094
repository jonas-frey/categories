To say that monos are regular (in a variety or, more generally, in a general
category satisfying some very minor hypotheses) amounts to the so-called
Intersection Property of Amalgamations: for any two algebras A, B with a common
subalgebra C, if there are monomorphisms f : A --> D, g: B --> D that coincide
on C, then one can choose f, g with the additional property that C is their
pullback. References:

(1983) 79-141.

The last paper contains a large table of specific categories, including
lattices (the affirmative answer is attributed to Gratzer in this case), plus
an extensive list to the literature. For some categories, the question whether
monos are regular can get quite involved, for example in the category of
compact (Hausdorff) groups, for which an affirmative answer was provided by
Poguntke (Math. Z. 130 (1973) 107-117).

The property in question obviously implies "epimorphisms are surjective", but
examples witnessing failure of the converse statement are harder to find: see
again the four-author paper.

Hope this helps.

Walter Tholen.
