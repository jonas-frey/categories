                     CALL FOR PAPERS

              The 13th International Workshop on
               Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)

                     June 6-10, 2016
         University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland

               http://qpl2016.cis.strath.ac.uk


The 13th International Workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)
will take place at the University of Strathclyde between Tuesday 7 and
Friday 10 June, 2016.

The workshop brings together researchers working on mathematical
foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and related areas,
with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical tools,
ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages,
semantical methods, and other computer science techniques applied to
the study of physical behaviour in general.

Previous QPL events were held in Oxford (2015), Kyoto (2014),
Barcelona (2013), Brussels (2012), Nijmegen (2011), Oxford (2010),
Oxford (2009), Reykjavik (2008), Oxford (2006), Chicago (2005),
Turku (2004), and Ottawa (2003).


INVITED SPEAKERS

Elham Kashefi (University of Edinburgh)
Tom Leinster (University of Edinburgh, to be confirmed)
Krysta Svore (Microsoft Research)
Stephanie Wehner (Technical University Delft)


SATELLITES

On Monday June 6 there will be tutorial lectures. More details will be
announced later.

On Saturday June 11 there will be a satellite workshop on "Semantic
spaces at the intersection of natural language processing, physics, and
cognitive science". More details can be found at:
   https://www.sites.google.com/site/semspworkshop.


IMPORTANT DATES

Submission: March 13, 2016
Notification: April 24
Papers ready: May 29
Tutorials: June 6
Workshop: June 7-10


SUBMISSIONS

Prospective speakers are invited to submit a contribution to the workshop.

  - Original contributions consist of a 5-12 page extended abstract which
    abstract which provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine
    interest and provides sufficient detail to allow the program committee
    to assess the merits of the work. Submission of work in progress is
    encouraged but must be more substantial than a research proposal.

  - Short contributions will also be considered, and consist of a 3 page
    description including a link to work that has already been published
    or submitted elsewhere, provided it is recent and relevant to the
    workshop.

Extended versions of accepted original research contributions will be
published in Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science
(EPTCS) after the workshop.

Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX, and must be submitted
in PDF format. Use of the EPTCS style is encouraged. Submission is done
via EasyChair: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qpl2016

There will be an award for the best paper whose authors are all students,
at the discretion of the programme committee.


REGISTRATION AND SUPPORT

Registration will be opened later, please visit the website for more details.

We encourage participation of graduate students and those with caregiving
responsibilities. We hope to be able to provide limited financial support
for travel and accommodations; details will be announced later.
