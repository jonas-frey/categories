IWQC 2020 Call for contributions
---
4rd International Workshop on Quantum Compilation.
https://quantumweek2020.cambridgequantum.com/iwqc20.html

We invite contributions to the 4th International Workshop on Quantum
Compilation.

The workshop aims to bring together researchers from quantum computing,
electronic design automation, and compiler construction. Open questions
that we anticipate this group to tackle include new methods for circuit
synthesis and optimization, optimizations and rewriting, techniques for
verifying the correctness of quantum programs, and new techniques for
compiling efficient circuits and protocols regarding fault-tolerant and
architecture constraints.The scope of the workshop includes, but is not
limited to, current hot topics in quantum circuit design such as :

* space-optimizing compilers for reversible circuits
* design-space exploration for automatic code generation from classical HDL
specification
* quantum programming languages and type systems
* reversible logic synthesis
* technology-aware mapping
* error correction
* optimized libraries (e.g., for arithmetic and Hamiltonian simulation)
* benchmarking of circuits for small and medium scale quantum computers
* quantum and reversible circuit peep-holing and (re)synthesis
* software and tools for all above mentioned topics
* quantum outreach: coding contests, tutorials, education

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic the workshop will happen as an online
virtual event.  We will investigate the possibility of an in-person meeting
if the situation improves, but the full participation in the workshop will
be possible remotely.

Invited Speakers :
* Eleanor Rieffel, Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (QuAIL) NASA
Ames Research Center
* Margaret Martonosi, Quantum computer architecture and programming
languages research group (QArch), Princeton University

Important dates:
* 14 August 2020: Submission of abstracts
* 31 August 2020: Notification of decisions
* 23 and 24 September 2020 : Workshop

Note that IWQC20 forms part of a week long sequence of workshops on quantum
computing; see https://quantumweek2020.cambridgequantum.com/

Instructions for authors :
The main purpose of the workshop is to exchange recent ideas and research
in the area of quantum compilation. The workshop has no formal proceedings.
Authors are invited to submit an abstract or a paper, with no restrictions
on the format. Submission of tool and case-study papers are highly
encouraged. In case of a positive evaluation, submissions are accepted
either as oral or poster presentation to be part of the workshop program.
All abstracts and papers are distributed only among the participants.

Please submit your papers through EasyChair:
