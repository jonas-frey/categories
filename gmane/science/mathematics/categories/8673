I don't understand why atomic formulas are terms but not formulas.
Always thought the Lawvere's hyperdoctrines made all this very clear:
terms are in the base and formulas are in the fibres.
In case there is a generic family of propositions  A:Prop |- True(A)
we can turn predicates into terms of type Prop. That's the shift to HOL.

The 2 different negations are just negations in two different fibres.
