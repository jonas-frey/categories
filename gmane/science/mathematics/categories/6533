[Categories note: continuations have long played an important role in
the foundations of programming languages, while "delimited"
continuations were invented as an approach to building composition
principles for continuations.  Contributions to the workshop from
categories readers would be very welcome. -NZ]

=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 An RDP 2011 workshop -
=A0 =A0 Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming



SCOPE AND TOPIC:

Since their introduction in the late 1980s, delimited control
operators have triggered increasing interest among programmers and the
programming language community, found unexpected applications in
conceptual domains such as linguistics and constructive mathematics,
and shown themselves to be the natural development of classical
control operators. =A0The first workshop on the Theory and Practice of
Delimited Continuations aims to bring together people working with the
many different (practical, theoretical, or foundational) aspects of
delimited continuations, in the hope of fostering some unity and
progress.

Contributions on all topics related to delimited continuations are
welcome, as either short abstracts or full papers (see SUBMISSION
PROCEDURE below).

INVITED SPEAKERS:
To be announced

IMPORTANT DATES:

# Submission of full papers: 25 February 2011
# Submission of short abstracts: 18 March 2011
# Notification of acceptance: 25 March 2011
# Final version due: 8 April 2011
# Workshop: 29-30 May 2011

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE:

We accept submissions of two kinds:
* short abstracts (1 to 2 pages)
* full papers up to 12 pages

Short abstracts are proposals for talks within a wide rubric: reports
on work-in-progress or recently published papers, surveys or short
tutorials, system demonstrations, etc. =A0Full papers must describe new
work not under consideration for publication elsewhere. =A0Accepted
papers and abstracts will be presented at the workshop and included in
the proceedings, published as a technical report.

Papers and abstracts should be formatted using the easychair.cls LaTeX
class (see http://easychair.org/coolnews.cgi), and may be submitted
electronically as pdf files via the easychair website:
