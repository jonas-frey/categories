Dear Colleagues=2C

I have no explanation for the disappearance of Mamuka Jibladze during eight=
  days from his home in Tbilisi. I only know that he has come back home. He =
may not want to talk about it. The minute I learn anything I will communica=
te with you. In connection with this case=2C I received many private commun=
ications=2C but I single out two.

One colleague wrote to me privately yesterday something with which I agree:=
"I guess if Mamuka had been picked up for a week by State Security and then=
  released near that hotel=2C it might be impolitic for such news to be reve=
aled. On the other hand=2C if Mamuka just had to take a week-long break (a =
"personal week=2C" as the HR offices might call it)=2C it might be too emba=
rrassing for that to be revealed as well. So we in the great outside world =
may just never know. And I guess we should just come to learn to live with =
that uncertainty."


Another colleague accused me privtely today of crying wolf and of giving no=
  explanation or apology to the categories world as "it has all come to noth=
ing".First of all=2C we do not know whether the protests that his disappear=
ance has generated were not directly linked to his "release" or "reappearan=
ce". Secondly=2C the Georgian HUman Rights Ornagzation was quite alarmed be=
cuse of the possible political aspects in connection with the resignation o=
f Maia Miminasvili as head of the National Examination Center in Georgia an=
d of the subsequent resignation of Mamuka Jibladze along with 60 other empl=
oyees=2C most of whom received serious threats to themselves or their famil=
ies. So=2C I repeat=2C we do not know if what some of us did ws "for nothin=
g".=20


I am in touch with Amnesty International in case there are further developm=
ents that warrant their intervention. As for apologizing=2C this is out of =
place. Should any of us disppeared in a country with a bad human rights rec=
ord=2C I advise strongly to cry out immediately=2C even if in the end we ma=
y be accused of crying wolf.=20

With relief=2C for now.
Marta
