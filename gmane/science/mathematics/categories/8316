A small correction. As well as:

Let p: E ----> B be a fibration. If B is cartesian closed, each fibre is
cartesian closed with exponents stable under pullback, and Pi's exist
along product projections (and satisfy BCC), then E is cartesian closed.

the following stronger statement is true (weakening the stability
required of the exponents):

Let p: E ----> B be a fibration. If B is cartesian closed, each fibre is
cartesian closed with exponents stable under pullback along product
projections, and Pi's exist along product projections (and satisfy BCC),
then E is cartesian closed.

In order to capture Ross' example, this stronger form is needed, since
[f,1]:[B,Set] ---> [A,Set] does not in general preserve exponentials,
while [pi_2,1]:[B,Set] ---> [A*B,Set] does so.
