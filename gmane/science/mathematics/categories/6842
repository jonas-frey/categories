Let us define a short exact sequence 0 --> U --> V --> W --> 0 by saying
that U --> V is the kernel of V --> W ("left exactness") and V --> W is the
cokernel of U --> V ("right exactness"). If so, your formulation becomes is
trivial in full generality:

The kernel of a morphism X --> Y (in any pointed category with zero object)
is the pullback of X --> Y and 0 --> Y. Therefore:

(a) D' is the pullback of G --> C and 0 --> C;

(b) the kernel of D --> G --> C is the pullback of D --> G --> C and 0 -->
C;

(c) as follows from (a) and (b), the kernel of D --> G --> C is the pullback
of D --> G and D' --> C;

(d) similarly, the kernel of D' --> G --> C' is the same pullback.

Since this is true in every category with zero object (you don't need any
normality argument), the dual statement is also always true (and everything
with pushouts and cokernels instead of pullbacks and kernels is equally
clear). Moreover (obviously), for the coincidence of the kernels we need
only the "left exactness", and dually, for the coincidence of the cokernels
we need only the "right exactness" of our original sequences.

However, what Jim's says is not true in every pointed Barr exact category
with cokernels: it will be true if and only if every regular epimorphism is
normal (that is, is the cokernel of something, or, equivalently, the
cokernel of its kernel).
