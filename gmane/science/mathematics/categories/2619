I wrote:

  [I]n the category  of  N-sets (sets with a distinguished self-map)
  let  A  be the two-element set in which the distinguished self-map
  has a unique fixed point....A^A, the object of self-maps of  A,
  falls apart as a coproduct (disjoint union) of continuously many
  N-sets. Hence if one takes the set of equivalence classes of  A^A,
  where the equivalence relation is the double-negation of equality,
  one obtains a discrete set (it has trivial N-action) whose
  cardinality is the continuum.

It's more complicated. One obtains a disjoint union of "cycles", that
is, objects of the form  Z/nZ  where the distinguished self-map is
addition by  1. For each  n > 0  there are only a finite number of
copies of  Z/nZ. The number of copies of  Z = Z/0Z  is uncountable.

Postscript:

The sequence of numbers of copies of each finite cycle is, of course,
guaranteed to be in Neil Sloan's "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer
Sequences", but we didn't have that. Instead in 1.925 of Cats &
Alligators we gave a ridiculous -- but both correct and unimprovable
-- formula for that finite number. Preceding it was a sentence that
begins "Bearing in mind that, as far as we know, this is computation
for its own sake". Anyway, you can find the same formula at

      mathworld.wolfram.com/IrreduciblePolynomial.html

under the name  L_q(n)  (with  q = 2).

With the exception of the zero'th value (in our case it's
2^{\Aleph_0}, for Lyndon words it's 1) here's what Sloan has to say:

Name: Degree n irreducible polynomials over GF(2); n-bead necklaces
           with beads of 2 colors when turning over is not allowed and
           with primitive period n; binary Lyndon words of length n.
Comments:  Also dimensions of free Lie algebras - see A059966, which is
           essentially the same sequence.
