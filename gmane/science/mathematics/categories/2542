=09       Structural Operational Semantics

       http://www.cs.auc.dk/~luca/SOS-WORKSHOP/

          A Satellite Workshop of CONCUR 2004
        30 August, 2004, London, United Kingdom

Aims:

Structural operational semantics (SOS) provides a framework=20
for giving operational semantics to programming and specification=20
languages.  A growing number of programming languages from=20
commercial and academic spheres have been given usable semantic=20
descriptions by means of structural operational semantics.=20
Because of its intuitive appeal and flexibility, structural=20
operational semantics has found considerable application in=20
the study of the semantics of concurrent processes.  Moreover,=20
it is becoming a viable alternative to denotational semantics=20
in the static analysis of programs, and in proving compiler=20
correctness.

Recently, structural operational semantics has been successfully=20
applied as a formal tool to establish results that hold for classes=20
of process description languages. This has allowed for=20
the generalization of well-known results in the field of process=20
algebra, and for the development of a meta-theory for process calculi=20
based on the realization that many of the results in this field=20
only depend upon general semantic properties of language constructs.

The proposed SOS workshop aims to be a forum for researchers,=20
students and practitioners interested in new developments and=20
directions for future investigation in the field of structural=20
operational semantics. One of the specific goals of the workshop is=20
to establish synergies between the concurrency and programming=20
language communities working on the theory and practice of SOS.=20

The workshop will also mark the publication of a special issue of=20
the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming, devoted to SOS.=20
Together with original research papers on SOS, this special issue=20
will feature a definitive version of Gordon Plotkin's 1981 DAIMI memo=20
on SOS, together with a piece by Plotkin on the origins of SOS.=20

Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

    * programming languages
    * process algebras
    * higher-order formalisms
    * rule formats for operational specifications
    * meaning of operational specifications
    * comparisons between denotational, axiomatic and SOS=20
    * compositionality of modal logics with respect to=20
      operational specifications
    * congruence with respect to behavioural equivalences
    * conservative extensions
    * derivation of proof rules from operational specifications
    * software tools that automate, or are based on, SOS

Papers reporting on applications of SOS to software engineering and=20
other areas of computer science are welcome.

Paper submission: =20

We solicit unpublished papers reporting on original research on=20
the general theme of SOS. Prospective authors are invited to submit=20
a pdf or postscript file with their extended abstract, whose length=20
should not exceed 15 pages, by email to all of the co-chairs at their=20
respective email addresses. The email message with the submission=20
should also include, in plain text, contact information for=20
the author(s), together with the title and abstract of the submission. =20
Submissions are to be received by Sunday, 6 June, 2004. Authors will=20
be notified of acceptance by Wednesday, 30 June, 2004. Submissions=20
from the PC members are allowed.=20

Proceedings: =20

Preliminary proceedings containing the abstracts of the talks will be=20
published as a volume in the BRICS Notes Series, and will be available=20
at the meeting. The final proceedings of the workshop will appear as=20
a volume in the ENTCS series. =20

If the quality and quantity of the submissions warrant it, the co-chairs=20
plan to arrange a special issue of an archival journal devoted to full=20
versions of selected papers from the workshop.=20

Important Dates:

    * Submission: Sunday 6 June 2004
    * Notification: Wednesday 30 June 2004
    * Final version: Friday July 16 2004
    * Workshop: Monday 30 August 2004
