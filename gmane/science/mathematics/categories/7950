Around 1986, Colin McLarty, Charles Wells, and I noticed that Scientific
American had recently published a few articles on subjects mathematical
and decided to try to write one on variable set theory, AKA topos theory.
Unfortunately, that particular window at Sci Am quickly closed.  Our
article was turned down and we forgot about it.  More recently, I decided
it might be interesting, or at least amusing to throw it open to the
categorical community.  The result can be found at
