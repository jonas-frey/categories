The purpose of BCTCS is to provide a forum in which researchers in
theoretical computer science can meet, present research findings, and

environment in which PhD students can gain experience in presenting
their work, and benefit from contact with established researchers.

travel, accommodation at the on-campus rate, and full registration.
It is easy to apply for one. Please see the website for details.

The scope of the colloquium includes all aspects of theoretical
computer science, including automata theory, algorithms, complexity
theory, semantics, formal methods, concurrency, types, languages and
logics. Both computer scientists and mathematicians are welcome to
attend, as are participants from outside of the UK.

The colloquium features both invited and contributed talks. This
year's invited speakers are

Susanne Albers, Humboldt-Universit=E4t zu Berlin, the LMS-sponsored
keynote speaker in Discrete Mathematics

Samson Abramsky, University of Oxford

Assia Mahboubi, INRIA - =C9cole Polytechnique

Angela Wallenburg, Altran UK.=20
