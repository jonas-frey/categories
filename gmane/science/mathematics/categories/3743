Jeff Egger gave a talk on some of these ideas at the Nice PSSL - I'm
somewhat surprised he hasn't replied to this thread. IIRC, the category
of operator algebras is an involutive monoidal category with respect to
one or other of the tensor products, and C*-algebras are exactly the
involutive monoids w.r.t. this tensor product. Can't remember which one
it was, though.
