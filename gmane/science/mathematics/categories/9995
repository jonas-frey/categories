that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the
conference to give the presentation.

Submitted papers must be in English presenting original research. They
must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In
particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to
multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.

Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer's LNCS
and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author
interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to
the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.

FASE will use double-blind reviewing. Authors are asked to omit their
names and institutions; refer to own prior work in the third person;
not to include acknowledgements that might identify them.

Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS
must be accompanied by an artifact. The artifact will be evaluated and
the outcome will be taken into account in the acceptance decision of
the paper.=20

ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase. TACAS will have
rebuttal for selected papers.=20


-- PUBLICATION

The proceedings will be published in the Advanced Research in
Computing and Software Science (ARCoSS) subline of Springer's LNCS
series. The proceedings volumes will appear in gold open access, so
the published versions of all papers will be available for everyone to
download from the publisher's website freely, from the date of online
publication, perpetually. The copyright of the papers will remain with
