I suspect I may not have been the first to notice this, since it's
fairly easy, though I'm not aware that it's ever been mentioned
in print. (If anyone knows otherwise, I'd be interested to hear.)


Claim: Let C be a symmetric monoidal closed category, and
let D be an object of C. Then the following are equivalent:

1. There exists a natural isomorphism A = (A -o D) -o D,
2. The functor (- -o D) is full and faithful,
3. The canonical natural transformation A -> (A -o D) -o D is
   invertible.


Lemma 1. Let G: X -> Y and H: Y -> Z be functors. If HG is faithful
then G is faithful; if HG is full and G is essentially surjective,
then H is full.

Proof: easy.

Lemma 2. Let C be a category, and F: C -> C an endofunctor. If FF
is naturally isomorphic to 1_C, then F is an equivalence.

Proof: Certainly F is essentially surjective, since every object
X in C is naturally isomorphic to FFX. It then follows by Lemma 1
that F is full and faithful.


For the implication 1 => 2, take F = (- -o D) in Lemma 2.


For the implication 2 => 3, consider the following sequence of
isomorphisms natural in A \in C:

    C(A, A)
 -> C(A -o D,  A -o D)       ;apply the functor (- -o D)
 =  C((A -o D) @ A, D)       ;closure
 =  C(A @ (A -o D), D)       ;symmetry of tensor
 =  C(A,  (A -o D) -o D)     ;closure again

By definition, this natural transformation corresponds under Yoneda
to the canonical A -> (A -o D) -o D. Since (- -o D) is full and faithful,
the first step is invertible; the others are necessarily so. Therefore,
by the Yoneda correspondence, the canonical natural transformation with
components A -> (A -o D) -o D is invertible.

[ Robin Cockett pointed out to me that this can be decomposed into
  two steps, one easy and one well-known:
   a) The functor (- -o D) is self-adjoint on the right.
   b) For any adjunction, the left adjoint is full and faithful
      if and only if the unit of the adjunction is invertible. ]


Finally, the implication 3 => 1 is immediate.
