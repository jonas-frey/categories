Dear Richard,

Thank you for your quick answer, which unfortunately is both =20
incorrect and incomplete.

It is incorrect because Fib(S) does not have pullbacks or equalizers =20
hence it not finitely complete
It is incomplete for two reasons:
(i) When I asked for significant mathematical examples, I meant apart =20=

from locally small fibrations, because I do not believe in abstract =20
nonsense "generalizations" which have no genuine examples except well =20=

known special cases.
(ii) In my mail there was another question which you seem to have =20
forgotten namely: What can you prove about the locally small objects =20
of K, especially since you assume nothing on C ?
To complete my remark (ii) I would mind a little less the lack of =20
genuine examples of this generalized notion if at least under the =20
mere assumptions of Street on could prove a few non totally trivial =20
results.
I would like to point out for example that, with Street's definition, =20=

one cannot even prove that a small object of K is locally small.

I'm sure that Ross, who gave this definition, will very soon give a =20
correct and complete answer to the three questions I asked him in my =20
previous mail.

Best regards,

Jean
