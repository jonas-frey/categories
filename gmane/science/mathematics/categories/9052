What about the 1984 Joyal-Tierney "An extension of the Galois theory of
Grothendieck", AMS Memoirs 309 ?

They already do extensive work concerning bounded topos
over an elementary topos, especially exploiting change of base (and
explicitely saying so in their introduction).

regards e.d.

> The setting of a 2-category GTop bounded over an elementary topos S has been  extensibly worked out in practice in (for instance) the book by Marta Bunge  and Jonathon Funk, Singular Coverings of Toposes, LNM 1890, Springer 2006, and in several papers by myself or with collaborators which you can look up in my Research Gate page. The terminology that I have used for it everywhere (including lectures) is Top_S, by which it is not meant Top/S but the sub 2-category of it whose objects are bounded geometric morphisms between elementary toposes, with codomain S. In particular It often becomes necessary to consider change of base. The terminology is well adapted to the consideration of certain distinguished sub 2-categories of Top_S - for instance LTop_S denotes that whose objects are geometr
 ic morphisms with codomain S and a locally  connected elementary topos. I hope this is useful to you.
