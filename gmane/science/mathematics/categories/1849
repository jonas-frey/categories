you mean unordered? i would implement it as an ordered graph, with an
additional involutive map on the edges, ie

        Edges <--inv-- Edges ==dom,cod==> Nodes
        dom.inv = cod
        inv.inv = id

--- which, in a way, confirms that

isn't the "ordering" of the components of a product AxB (by the names,
colors A and B), in a similar way, "factored out" by the canonical
isomorphism with BxA? isn't coherence theory the way we can always factor
out such arbitrary annotations on objects?

(SORRY i am posting too much.)
