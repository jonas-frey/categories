The 10th International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science
               26-28 March 2010, Paphos, Cyprus
                 (co-located with ETAPS 2010)
                 <http://event.cwi.nl/cmcs10/>

Aims and scope
-------------------------

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers with a common
interest in the theory of coalgebras and its applications.  Over the
last two decades, coalgebra has developed into a field of its own,
presenting a mathematical foundation for various kinds of dynamical
systems, infinite data structures, and logics.  Coalgebra has an ever
growing range of applications in and interactions with other fields such
as reactive and interactive system theory, object oriented and
concurrent programming, formal system specification, modal logic,
dynamical systems, control systems, category theory, algebra, analysis,
etc.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

 * the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
   approaches);
 * coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
   languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
 * coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
 * coalgebras and data types;
 * (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
   bisimulations or invariants);
 * coalgebras and algebras;
 * coalgebraic specification and verification;
 * coalgebras and (modal) logic;
 * coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid
   systems).


An anniversary: the 10th CMCS
---------------------------------------------

CMCS took place for the first time when ETAPS started, in 1998.  Since
then, it has always been collocated with ETAPS, becoming bi-annual since
the start of CALCO (Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra) in 2005.

In 2010, we will celebrate the 10th edition of CMCS, by inviting a
number of specialists in the field to present overviews of both obtained
results and future challenges.

Invited Speakers
-------------------------

At this tenth meeting the following invited speakers will present
overviews of important subareas.

 * Venanzio Capretta: Coalgebra in functional programming and type theory
 * Bartek Klin: Operational semantics coalgebraically
 * Dirk Pattinson: Logic and coalgebra
 * Ana Sokolova: Probabilistic systems coalgebraically


Short contributions
-----------------------------

Apart from the presentation of regular papers (see list below) and
invited contributions, some time has been reserved for *short
contributions* .

These will not be published in the proceedings but will be bundled in a
CWI technical report.

They should be no more than two pages and may describe work in progress,
summarise work submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere, or in
some other way appeal to the CMCS audience. The instructions for
submitting short contributions can be found at:
<http://event.cwi.nl/cmcs10/submission.html>


Important dates
-------------------
 * 27 February 2010: strict submission deadline short contributions
 * 28 February 2010: deadline normal registration
 * 6 March 2010: notification short contributions
 * 26-28 March 2010: the workshop
