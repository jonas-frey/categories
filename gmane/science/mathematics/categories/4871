I have not kept up with the field very well, but I can recommend these
works:

Peter Johnstone, *Sketches of an Elephant*, Vol. 2, OUP 2003: the chapter on
sketches.  (I am in rural Wisconsin at the moment asnd don't have access to
the book.  If OUP would make its pages available to look at on Amazon I
could have told you the exact page.)

Bagchi and Wells, *Graph Based Logic and Sketches*, here:

http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0809/0809.3023v1.pdf

Also Kinoshita, et al 1997, referred to in GBLS.  There might be relevant
papers since 1993 mentioned in the Elephant, too.

Category people:  If you can suggest other papers that should be included,
let me know soon, and I will revise the sketches paper to include them (and
the ones I mentioned above).
