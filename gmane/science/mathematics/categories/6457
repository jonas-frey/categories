I have seen very often the following "abstract" definition of a =20
fibration in a 2-category C :
A map (i.e. a 1-cell) p: X --> S is a fibration iff for each object Y =20=

of C the functor C(Y,p):  C(Y,X) --> C(Y,S) is a fibration (in the =20
usual sense) which depends "2-functorially" on Y.

Such an "obvious" definition is much too naive and does not give the =20
correct notion in most examples.

1- Even if C=3D Cat, the 2-category of (small) categories, a fibration =20=

in the abstract sense is a Grothendieck fibration which admits a =20
cleavage. Thus if we don't assume AC, which we don't need to define =20
fibrations, it does not coincide with the usual one.

2- The situation is much worse in more general cases. Suppose E is a =20
topos (this assumption is much too strong), and take C =3D Cat(E), the =20=

category of internal categories in E. On can define internal =20
fibrations, and "fibrations" in the  previous "abstract" sense. They =20
do not coincide.
It all boils down to the following remark: E and (E=B0, Set) are =20
Toposes, the Yoneda functor E --> (E*,Set) preserves an reflects =20
limits, but "nothing else" of the internal logic, which is needed to =20
define internal fibrations.

Best to all,

Jean
