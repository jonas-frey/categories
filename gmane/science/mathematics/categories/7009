I guess this would be on p.811 of Volume 2.  But I don't see any mention
of Mostowski there.  Where can one find Mostowski's account?  And when
did he propose it?

Ok, so it would appear that there are two rather different approaches to
making FOL "safe" for the empty universe, one syntactic and the other
semantic.

1.  Replace the usual notion of first order logic (as treated in a great
many textbooks) with one in which formulas carry along contexts governed
by rules that are part of inference rules like Modus Ponens.  The
variables comprising these contexts could be typed or untyped.

2.  Leave the language, axioms, and rules of first order logic unchanged
from how it's been treated for a great many decades, and instead modify
just the semantics so that there is only one truth value in the
inconsistent situation where the universe is empty yet there are free
variables needing values.

I gave pretty complete details of how 2 would work at
http://boole.stanford.edu/Empty , based on D^V being empty when D is
empty and V is not, making 2^D^V = 1.

I am willing to believe that 1 can be made to work consistently, though
I would be interested to see the details.

Since logic courses may not want to be forced to modify their curriculum
to introduce contexts, nor to remove them, it would seem beneficial to
have both the above options, chosen according to the needs of the course
and the preferences of the instructor.

This serves as an example of why the rules for option 1 need to be
spelled out in detail.  If the context is empty, where did a come from?
   And how did it get to be universally quantified?  By making
generalization mandatory?  Is all this codified in one place, and if so
where?  If the Elephant, then it would be helpful to have an explicit
list of axioms in one place.  These may exist in the Elephant, but they
seem rather scattered around, making them something of a moving target.
   The rules of the pure untyped predicate calculus are well known, they
were established in the first half of century, and their completeness
was shown by Goedel.
