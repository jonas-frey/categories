Jim:

I don't understand your context precisely. (I heard a talk the other =20
day where the speaker used "category" to mean "A_{infinity}-category" =20=

without any explanation.) However I can tell a story which uses some =20
of the words you have.

Without the axiom of choice (such as in a topos), there are two =20
different conditions on a functor f : A --> X for it to be an =20
"equivalence":

1) there is a functor g : X --> A such that f g and g f are isomorphic =20=

to identity functors; and,

2) f is full, faithful and essentially surjective on objects (this =20
last means each object of X is isomorphic to a value of f).

Clearly 1) implies 2). The converse holds when epis split (Ax Choice) =20=

in the ambient world.

Stacks are designed not to see the difference between equivalences of =20=

types 1) and 2); that is, if you hom out of an equivalence of type 2) =20=

into a stack [for an appropriate topology], you get an equivalence of =20=

type 1).

See old papers of Par=E9, Bunge, Joyal, . . .
