No problem.

I understand that posts about terminology get tedious, but I do actually
think this matters.  Mental health organizations constantly have to fight
misconceptions about mental illness.  Those misconceptions can do real
harm to those who are ill.  Schizophrenia as "split personality" is one of
them.  For example, Mind, a well-known British mental health charity,
says:

     There is more media misinformation about schizophrenia than about any
     other psychiatric diagnosis.  It's not true that schizophrenia means
     'split personality'

Many websites on mental health contain statements along similar lines; a
few links are below.

We have the freedom to choose any term we like for the mathematical
concept.  We can do a small good thing by not choosing a term that
perpetuates a damaging myth about a serious psychiatric disorder.

Best wishes,
Tom
