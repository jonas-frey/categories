Dear All,

I had posted the message below yesterday, but the message had
some html in it (from previous messages in the exchange, I believe).
It is somewhat redundant today because Professor Porst's paper
has now been mentioned in a different posting, but it can still serve
as a note of appreciation to him. :-)

Best regards,

Todd

Indeed, Hans-E. Porst has done a lot of valuable work in the area
of coalgebras and comodules. I would also recommend his article
"On corings and comodules", Archivum Mathematicum 42 (2006),
no. 4, 419-425.
