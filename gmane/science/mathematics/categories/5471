Thanks, Ross.  Hopefully Bob will phrase it that way next time.  ;)

If 2 is the usual symmetric monoidal closed category with objects 0 and=20
1 and only non-identity morphism 0 --> 1, then Chu(2,1) has four objects=20
while Chu(2,0) has only three, but both are self-dual.  The CEO of=20
search engine company Cuil (Old Irish for knowledge) had finite=20
categories of this kind in her 1997 Ph.D. thesis.

What got me started on my previous message was that Bob was calling=20
these "syntactic" when to me they were semantic.  If by "syntactic" he=20
meant "finite," or more generally less than some specified ordinal, then=20
I have no problem with that, other than that I'd prefer he be specific=20
about the ordinal rather than vaguely saying "syntactic."
