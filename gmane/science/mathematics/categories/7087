Yes, I always thought it odd that even when one wants to accept
category-theoretic
foundations (e.g. ETCS or similar), then suddenly something like this
comes along,
where people start saying there is a thing which is an object of two
different categories.
Such a property isn't even expressible in type theory-style
foundations, where even
elements of two different sets aren't comparable...

But since both of the categories in each pair Vaughan mentioned are
enriched over
Set, we *are* allowed to compare hom-sets, at least using some sort of roughly
canonical isomorphism. Using the formalism suggested (hom-sets), it
seems much easier
to set down a definition of these slippery objects.

And (more whimsically) regarding terminology: if someone wanted to use
the analogy
of a door, why not a window? We can have fenestral objects, by which
one can 'see'
from one category to another. And unfortunately, 'liminal' gives rise
to subliminal, which
might be a natural prefix extension mathematically but is even more
confusing than
the existing inaccurate term. :-)
