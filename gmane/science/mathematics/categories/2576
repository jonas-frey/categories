Using picture mode is very convenient when things aren't too complicated,
and editing picture mode code is always (well, almost always) easier than
redoing mouse based drawing.  But the combination of a mouse-based drawing
to generate picture mode code, then editing that for fine-tuning is often
helpful.  For those who are condemned to the Windows framework, let me
recommend TeXCad - originally written by G Horn (it was then part of the
emtex distribution), currently maintained by Gautier de Montmollin
<http://homepage.sunrise.ch/mysunrise/gdm/texcad.htm>.  Like Xfig, it
creates picture mode code from your mouse-based drawing.  The two programs
are not completely similar (I prefer TeXCad, but others may differ!), but if
you're using Windows, give it a try.
