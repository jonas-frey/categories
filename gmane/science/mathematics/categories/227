"Operads" are like sets of operations.

A monad is an extension of a functor. If the functor is the term functor,
then the operations of the signature lies inside the functor, and the
"operations" eta and mu are identities, or at least something very
isomorphic to identities.

In the filter functor eta is point filters and mu is Kowalsky's
diagonalization.

In my view there is no logic monoid => monad, and I cannot see the
full idea behind using "operads", so help me Mona.
