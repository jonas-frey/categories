Dear David,

your property holds in any regular category provided f and g are regular
epis, and so in any elementary topos provided f and g are mere epis.
Indeed, your square is a pullback square of regular epis, and in a
regular category, any such is also a pushout square.

A slightly more general context where your property holds is a finitely
complete category with a strong epi-mono factorisation system for which
strong epis are closed under pullback along monos and closed under
cartesian product.

All the best,
                Clemens.
