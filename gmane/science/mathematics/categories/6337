Dear George=2C
>
Thanks for your interesting response.=A0Let me just comment here on your "a=
ddition 1" below. It is my contention that "unramified coverings" is not an=
  appropriate expression to describe those "coverings" not associated with a=
  Galois theory in your sense=2C as first=2C there is a specific meaning att=
ached to it=2C and secondly=2C a "branched Galois theory" already exists in=
formally in the subject of knot groupoids. One may possibly generalize your=
  Galois theories to include these phenomena. I devote one paragraph to each=
  contention.=A0

>
1. When R.H.Fox ("Covering spaces with singularities"=2C R.H. Fox et al=2C =
editors=2C Algebraic Geometry and Topology: A Symposium in honor of S. Lefs=
chetz=2C Princeton University Press=2C 1957=2C 243-257) introduced spreads =
and their completions=2C he had in mind what the title of his paper says=2C=
  that is=2C "coverings with singularities" so=2C not the traditional locall=
y constant coverings. There could be "ramifications"=2C or branchings over =
points of the base.=A0But no folds. Specifically=2C he was thinking of bran=
ched coverings =A0(branching over a knot in the base) as the spread complet=
ions of locally constant coverings=2C in which branching points were added =
to the domain space. This is what led him to define a notion of spread=2C a=
nd then perform a completion process leading to another spread singled out =
among all such corresponding to a given cosheaf on the base space. The bran=
ched coverings=2C and more generally the complete spreads of which they are=
  the motivating example=2C are "ramified". Now=2C add the condition that th=
e complete spread (e.g. a branched covering) be a local homeomorphism. This=
  does not force it to be locally constant=2C as we know=2C but it cannot th=
en have ramifications. Hence the expression "unramified coverings".=A0
>
2. As I said in my last posting=2C the =A0"branched coverings"=2C which are=
  very important in topology=2C yet do not correspond to any Galois theory i=
n your sense=2C should correspond to a "generalized Galois theory" or to a =
"branched Galois theory". To support my contention=2C note that=2C in (M. B=
unge and S. Lack=2C van Kampen theorems for toposes=2C Advances in Mathemat=
ics 179/2 (2003) 291-317)=2C we obtain=2C as an application of the van Kamp=
en theorems we prove therein=2C =A0a connection with the use of the automor=
phism group of a (universal) branched covering in the calculation of knot g=
roups=2C as advocated by Fox. In particular=2C and the point I am making he=
re=2C the expression "unramified coverings" does not describe them accurate=
ly=2C as there may be ramifications. For a topos E=2C there is a biequivale=
nce of the 2-categories of branched coverings of E branching over an object=
  Y (the latter thought of as the complement of a knot K) =A0on the one hand=
=2C and that of all locally constant coverings of the slice topos E/Y on th=
e other. The latter may in turn be viewed as the fundamental groupoid of E/=
Y=2C or as the knot groupoid G(K) of K. There is a "Galois theory" there no=
t associated with coverings in your sense=2C that is=2C with locally consta=
nt coverings.=A0

>
All of this requires further investigation=2C for which I will have no time=
  possibly until December=2C due to my trip to Buenos Aires.=A0

With best regards=2C
