RUSSELL'08 - PROOF THEORY MEETS TYPE THEORY
  A "Small Workshop" of the European TYPES Project
  Call for Participation and Contributed Talks
  Swansea, Wales, 15-16 March 2008
  http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csetzer/russell08/index.html
* In 1908 the British Philosopher and Mathematician Bertrand Russell,
  who was born and died in Wales, published the article "Mathematical
  Logic as based on the Theory of Types" which contained a first
  matured exposition of Type Theory.  In the same year, Ernst Zermelo's
  "Untersuchungen ueber die Grundlagen der Mengenlehre I" introduced
  the basis of current axiomatic set theory as an alternative
  approach to the foundations of Mathematics.
  A central theme of Proof Theory is to compare these different
  foundations.  Proof Theory uses as its main tool ordinal notation
  systems, the basis of which was laid by Oswald Veblen in his paper
  "Continuous Increasing Functions of Finite and Transfinite
  Ordinals", again in 1908.
  A century later, Proof Theory and Type Theory are flourishing more
  than ever before, and their manifold interconnections are driving
  important developments in Mathematics and Computer Science.
  At this workshop we meet and discuss cutting edge research at the
  interface of Proof Theory and Type Theory.
* Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
  Proof Theory of Type Theory;  Relationship between Type Theory and
  Set Theory; Program extraction from proofs; Normalisation and
  Cut-elimination; New approaches to ordinal analysis Universes and
  reflection principles;  Equality in Type Theory; Philosophical and
  historical aspects of Proof Theory and Type Theory
* Invited Speakers: To be confirmed.
* Participation and Contributed Talks:
  Please send an email to Anton Setzer (a.g.setzer@swansea.ac.uk)
  as soon as possible, but no later than the 29th of February 2008.


WORKSHOP ON MODAL FIXPOINT LOGICS
  Call for contributions
  March 25-27, Amsterdam, the Netherlands
  Organizers: Luigi Santocanale and Yde Venema.
* The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers from
  various
  backgrounds, in particular, computer scientists and pure logicians,
  in order to discuss modal fixpoint logics from various perspectives,
  including those of model theory, proof theory, algebra and duality,
  and automata theory.
* Deadline for submission of contributed papers: February 1, 2008.
* Invited speakers: Giovanna D'Agostino, Johan van Benthem, Marcello
  Bonsangue, Dietmar Berwanger,  Erich Graedel (to be confirmed),
  Dexter Kozen (to be confirmed), Giacomo Lenzi, Damian Niwinski,
  Colin Stirling, Thomas Studer, Albert Visser, Igor Walukiewicz,
  and Thomas Wilke (to be confirmed).

  Logic in Computer Science (LICS). It will be held at Carnegie Mellon
  University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
* We are proud to announce a joint CSF/LICS invited speaker: David
  Basin.
* New theoretical results in computer security are welcome. Also welcome
  are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open questions
  and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories. Panel
  proposals are sought as well as papers. Possible topics include, but
  are not limited to:
  - Access control
  - Anonymity and Privacy
  - Authentication
  - Data and system integrity
  - Database security

  Work towards this goal is a collaborative, international effort
  with contributions from both academia and industry. The envisioned
  virtues of providing software technology developed on a mathematical
  basis include: correctness, which can be proved mathematically;
  safety, so that developed software can be used in the implementation
  of critical systems; portability, i.e., independence from computing
  platforms and language generations; and evolutionary change, i.e.,
  the software is self-adaptable and evolves with the problem domain.
* Topics of interest include: systems software technology;
  application software technology; concurrent and reactive systems;
  formal methods in industrial software development; formal techniques
  for software requirements, design; evolutionary software/adaptive
  systems; logic programming, functional programming, object
  paradigms;
  constraint programming and concurrency; program verification and
  transformation; programming calculi; specification languages and
  tools; formal specification and development case studies; logic,
  category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra; algebraic
  foundations for languages and systems, coinduction; theorem proving
  and logical frameworks for reasoning; logics of programs; algebra
  and coalgebra. For system demonstrations or ordinary papers:
  software development environments; support for correct software
  development; system support for reuse; tools for prototyping;
  component based software development tools; validation and
  verification; computer algebra systems; theorem proving systems.
* Important dates: Abstract submission due: 1 March 2008;
  Paper submission due: 8 March 2008; Notification: 20 April 2008

  Symposium on the Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC 2008).
  Furthermore, there will be a symposium celebrating the contributions
  of Nancy Lynch and a number of workshops on topics related to CONCUR
  and PODC.  The overall event will take place at the University of
  Toronto on August 17-24, 2008.
* CONCUR 08 welcomes two categories of papers:
  - regular papers;
  - tool papers.
* Submissions are solicited in all areas of semantics, logics,
  verification and analysis of concurrent systems.  The principal
  topics include (but are not limited to):
  - basic models of concurrency (such as abstract machines, domain
    theoretic models, game theoretic models, process algebras, and
    Petri nets);
  - logics for concurrency (such as modal logics, temporal logics and
    resource logics);
  - models of specialized systems (such as biology-inspired systems,
    circuits, hybrid systems, mobile systems, multi-core processors,
    probabilistic systems, real time systems, synchronous systems, and
    web services);
  - verification and analysis techniques for concurrent systems (such
    as abstract interpretation, atomicity checking, model-checking,
    race detection, run-time verification, state-space exploration,
    static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem proving and type
    systems);
