  Dear all,

I would add some information on Bourbaki/categories/France.
Charles Ehresmann has been an active member of Bourbaki from 1936 up =20
to the end of the war, when he began to no more regularly participate =20
and wanted to resign (it was not accepted but replaced by an age limit =20
for active participation).
What Andre says:

    >Bourbaki had essentially two options: rewrite the whole treaty using
    > categories, or just introduce them in the book on homological algebra,
    >The second option won, essentially because of the enormity of the task
    > of rewriting everything.

is more easily understood if we take into account that communication =20
between France and the USA were entirely broken during the war, so =20
that mathematical ideas could not circulate and categories were only =20
heard of after the war, at a time where the more general parts of the =20
treatise were written or at least prepared (the successive versions =20
process was very slow).
     Charles said to me that he did not recall to have read Eilenberg =20
& Mac Lane's paper before the fifties, or at least not seen its =20
interest. Naturally he had sooner made a large use of groupoids in is =20
foundation of differential geometry, and he had even defined the =20
general "composition of jets" and given its properties, but without =20
linking it to the notion of a category. He exposed it in a course in =20
Rio de Janeiro in the early fifties, and one of his students =20
(Constantino de Barros who later came to Paris to prepare a thesis =20
with him) suggested that there was a connection with categories. =20
Charles' first large use of categories is in his seminal paper =20
"Gattungen von lokalen Strukturen" (1957, reprinted in "Charles =20
Ehresmann: Oeuvres completes et commentees" Part I).
    It is around this date that the word "category" began to circulate =20
in France.  In 1957, Choquet  (with whom I prepared my thesis) =20
suggested that I learnt more on the notion of category which he did =20
not know but seemed to have many applications (it was the reason for =20
which I first went to see Charles!). It should be noted that Choquet =20
was less conservative than many French mathematicians. In 1959, he =20
defended the development of probabilities by inviting Loomis to give a =20
course (I remember Henri Cartan saying then to Paul-Andre Meyer that =20
he should not study this domain for it would be bad for his career!). =20
And later on, he defended Logic which was very badly considered.
    A final remark: the "disdain" for categories (not to be confused =20
with 'ignorance') came only later on, since Charles was given the =20
"Prix Petit d'Ormoy" by the French Academy in 1965, essentially for =20
his recent work on categories...
