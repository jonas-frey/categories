Call for Papers

-----------------------------------------------------------------

4th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2008)
Leicester, United Kingdom,
September 7 - 13, 2008,
http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/icgt2008/

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The 4th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2008)=20
will be held in Leicester (United Kingdom) in the second week of=20
September 2008,  along with several satellite events. It continues the=20
line of conferences previously held in Barcelona (Spain) in 2002, Rome=20
(Italy) in 2004, and Natal  (Brazil) in 2006 as well as a series of six=20
International Workshops on Graph Transformation with Applications in=20
Computer Science between 1978 and 1998, and alternates with the workshop=20
series on Application of Graph Transformation with Industrial Relevance.=20
The conference takes place under the auspices of EATCS, EASST, and IFIP=20
WG 1.3. Awards will be given by EATCS and EASST for the best theoretical=20
and application-oriented papers. Proceedings are planned with Springer's=20
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Scope of the Conference:

Graphs are among the simplest and most universal models for a variety of=20
systems, not just in computer science, but throughout engineering and=20
the life sciences. When systems evolve we are interested in the way they=20
change, to predict, support, or react to their evolution. Graph=20
transformation combines the idea of graphs as a universal modelling=20
paradigm with a rule-based approach to specify evolution. The area is=20
concerned with both the theory of graph transformation and their=20
application to a variety of domains.

The conference aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners=20
interested in the foundations and application of graph transformation to=20
a variety of areas. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to

* foundations and theory of
      o General models of graph transformatio
      o High-level and adhesive replacement systems
      o Node-, edge-, and hyperedge replacement grammars
      o Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformations
      o Term graph rewriting
      o Hierarchical graphs and decompositions of graphs
      o Logic expression of graph transformation properties
      o Graph theoretical properties of graph languages
      o Geometrical and topological aspects of graph transformation
      o Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages
      o Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems
      o Structuring and modularization concepts for transformation system=
s
      o Graph transformation and Petri nets

* application to, languages and tool support for
      o Software architecture
      o Workflows and business processes
      o Software quality and testing
      o Software evolution
      o Access control and security models
      o Aspect-oriented development
      o Model-driven development, especially model transformations
      o Domain-specific languages
      o Implementation of programming languages
      o Bioinformatics and system biology
      o Natural computing
      o Image generation and pattern recognition techniques
      o Massively parallel computing
      o Self-adaptive systems and ubiquitous computing
      o Service-oriented applications and semantic web
      o Rule- and knowledge-based systems

------------------------------------------------------------------

Venue:

Located in the heart of England, Leicester is a truly multi-cultural=20
city. The city is a historic meeting place, where for centuries people=20
of different races and cultures have gathered, creating a rich and=20
unique heritage. This diversity continues today with a thriving ethnic=20
minority community accounting for more than a third of Leicester's=20
population. ICGT 2008 will be held at the University of Leicester's=20
conference facility next to the Universiy's botanic gardens.
