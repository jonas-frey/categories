Dear Eduardo=2C

I=2C too=2C consult ArXiv quite often=2C but I do so knowing that the artic=
les in question are unrefereed preprints=2C as are lectures. This may be st=
imulating but=2C even as a way to establish priority=2C it is quite dubious=
. For instance=2C in ArXiv=2C one has the possibility of updating a posting=
=2C and so correct mistakes or add comments received privately. I do not kn=
ow if the new postings replace the old one or coexists with it.=A0The refer=
ee system has its drawbacks=2C but it is normally of use=2C not only to the=
  readers and institutions=2C but also to the author(s). Posting in ArXiv sh=
ould always be followed by a publication in a refereed journal=2C but it no=
t always is.=A0As for journals in which the costs of publishing are nil=2C =
we categorists have the fortune of having a reputable journal such as TAC w=
here to send our papers. In this I totally agree with Mike Barr. Cahiers is=
=2C to a lesser extent perhaps=2C another such instance=2C and it can now b=
e accessed electronically (Numdam). There are also refereed proceedings of =
festshrifts or conferences which may not be rated as high as some journals=
=2C but which are part of our community life and=2C in some sense=2C a duty=
  that we have towards our respected colleagues.=A0As for high cost journals=
=2C I once signed a pledge not to publish in any Elsevier journal=2C and ad=
vertised my action in categories. Several people in this forum thought this=
  was stupid=2C but others praised me. It is a matter of conscience. I do no=
t have a solution=2C but asking libraries to stop subscribing to prestigiou=
s journals is in my view utopic. I already suggested requesting funding age=
ncies and university policy makers to give higher ratings to journals which=
  deserve to be so considered=2C particularly when the author gives reasons =
for choosing such journals rather than the high end ones. Finally=2C I (and=
  so=2C anyone) can access ArXiv postings without any problem- it is not har=
d to locate what one wants to read in them. An excellent source of informat=
ion=2C but it could never replace refereed journals.=A0

Regards=2C=A0

Marta
