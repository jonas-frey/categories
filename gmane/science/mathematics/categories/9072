One (rather trivial) reason why Goedel's Theorem isn't a paradox is
because it's true, and there's a good argument for its truth, indeed one
that can be formalised, but not in the system that the theorem is about.
This differentiates it from paradoxes such as that of the liar, which
can't consistently be assigned any truth value.

However, there's something deeper here, which is that most paradoxes go
against common sense, so that discovering them is a sort of
self-limitation of reason (showing that something which seemed obvious
is in fact false). And so was Goedel's theorem: nobody in the Hilbert
school seems to have thought seriously that their program could fail,
just that they hadn't quite got it right yet. And it says a great deal
for Hilbert's personal qualities that he accepted Goedel's theorem when
he saw it. (See Wilfried Sieg's wonderful book Hilbert's Programs and
Beyond; a must read, in my opinion.)
