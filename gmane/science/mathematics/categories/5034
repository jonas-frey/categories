The EPSRC grant `Coalgbraic Logic: Expanding the Scope' is a joint
project between Alexander Kurz (Leicester) and Achim Jung (Birmingham),
seeking to employ a Postdoc in Leicester and a PhD student in Birmingham.

The deadline to apply for the Postdoc position is 22 July 2009.

For more information see http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/akurz/clexp.html

The advert for the Postdoc position follows.

===

Applications are invited for a Research Associate to work with Dr.
Alexander Kurz (Leicester) and Prof. Achim Jung (Birmingham) on the
EPSRC-funded project `Coalgebraic Logic: Expanding the Scope'.

Coalgebraic Logic aims at a uniform theory of transition systems
(coalgebras) and their (typically modal) logics. Central notions are
bisimilarity, co-induction, and initial and final semantics. Coalgebraic
Logic is a young and quickly developing field closely related to areas
such as domain theory, modal logic, Stone duality in mathematics and to
program semantics, concurrency, process algebra in computer science.

The aim of the project is to expand the state of the art in Coalgebraic
Logic in 3 directions: (1) From modal logic to first-order logic; (2) to
study axiomatically defined classes of coalgebras; (3) explore the
relationship with domain theory and extend the expressiveness of logics
obtained via Domain Theory in Logical Form.

Applicants should have or be nearing completion of a PhD in an area
relevant to Coalgebraic Logic. This includes, for example, modal and
algebraic logic, domain theory, category theory, but also other aspects
of theoretical computer science, in particular those related to program
semantics and type theory. Applicants should have a proven track record
demonstrating ability to write, present and publish research results in
conferences and journals.

The closing date for this post is midnight on 22 July 2009.

Enquiries please email to Alexander Kurz.
