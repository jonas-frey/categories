Background and Objectives

ICTAC  is  an  International  Colloquium  on  Theoretical  Aspects  of
Computing  created   by  the  International   Institute  for  Software
Technology of the United Nations University (UNU-IIST). The aim of the
colloquium  is to  bring together  practitioners and  researchers from
academia,  industry and  government to  present research  results, and
exchange  experience,  ideas  and  solutions  for  their  problems  in
theoretical  aspects  of  computing.   Beyond these  scholarly  goals,
another main  purpose of the  conference is to promote  cooperation in
research  and education between  participants and  their institutions,
from developing  and industrial  countries, as in  the mandate  of the
United Nations University. The previous  six ICTAC events were held in
Guiyang, China  (2004), Hanoi, Vietnam (2005),  Tunis, Tunisia (2006),
Macau  (2007),  Istanbul, Turkey  (2008)  and  Kuala Lumpur,  Malaysia
(2009).  ICTAC  2010 includes  two special tracks:  a track  on Formal
Approaches to Testing, chaired by  Marie-Claude Gaudel, and a track on
the Grand Challenge in Verified Software, chaired by Jim Woodcock.

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:
- automata theory and formal languages
- principles and semantics of programming languages
- logics and their applications
- software architectures and their description languages
- software specification, refinement, verification and testing,
- model checking and theorem proving
- formal techniques in software testing
- models of object and component systems
- coordination and feature interaction
- integration of  theories, formal  methods and tools  for engineering
 computing systems
- service-oriented development
- service-oriented architectures: models and development methods
- document-driven development
- models of concurrency, security, and mobility
- theory of parallel, distributed, and grid computing
- real-time, embedded and hybrid systems
- type and category theory in computer science
- case studies, theories, tools and experiments of verified systems
- domain-specific  modeling and  technology: examples,  frameworks and
 experience

ICTAC 2010 will be held in Brazil, in the city of Natal, Rio Grande do
Norte.   It will  be organized  jointly with  the 3rd  edition  of the
Pernambuco  School on  Software  Engineering, to  be  held in  Recife,
Pernambuco, on the the topic of Formal Component Based Development and
Coordination.  ICTAC   2010  will  include   tutorials  and  technical
sessions.

Sponsors and Organisation

ICTAC 2010 will be organized  jointly by the Federal University of Rio
Grande do Norte and UNU-IIST. They are also sponsors of ICTAC 2010.

Invited Speakers

Paulo Borba (Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil)
Wolfram Schulte (Microsoft Research)

Submission and Publication

Submissions  to the  conference must  not  have been  published or  be
concurrently  considered for  publication  elsewhere. All  submissions
will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field,
technical and  presentation quality, and relevance  to the conference.
Papers should  be written in English  and not exceed 15  pages in LNCS
format    (see    http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html    for
details).        Papers       shall       be        submitted       at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac2010.    All   queries
should be sent to: ictac2010@iist.unu.edu.
