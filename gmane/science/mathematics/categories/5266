In ZF, "proper class" means "first-order formula," the formula phi(x)
being regarded as a stand-in for "the class of sets x such that phi(x)".
 In this case the only meaning that can be given to "a family of classes
indexed by a class" is that we have a formula with two variables
phi(x,y), so that each y indexes "the class of sets x such that
phi(x,y)".  In this case, as Andrej has said, the intersection of these
classes is represented by the formula "for all y, phi(x,y)", so there is
no problem.

In set-class theories such as NBG and MK, classes are things in their
own right (rather than having to be represented by first-order
formulas).  However, in neither of these theories can a class be an
*element* of another class, so "a family of classes indexed by a class"
can't mean "a class whose elements are classes" or "a class function
whose values are classes"---instead it has to be similar to the meaning
in ZF, such as a single class P whose elements are ordered pairs, where
each set y indexes the class { x | (x,y) \in P }.  Again in these
theories there is no trouble with the intersection of such an indexed
family of classes, it is just the class { x | (x,y) \in P for all y }.

However, in your example:

I don't think that "the class of reflective topologizing subcategories
of X" is a legitimate class in the sense of ZF, NBG, or MK.  Each
reflective topologizing subcategory is itself a proper class, and (in
NBG and MK) classes can't be elements of other classes, so there is no
class of all reflective topologizing subcategories of X, and thus no
class to "index" the intersection you want to take.

I think you *can* still define this intersection in MK, however: it is
the class

{ a \in ob(X) | a \in W for any reflective topologizing subcategory W of
X that contains both Y and Z }

This is allowable in MK because its comprehension axiom for classes
allows formulas that can quantify over classes.  The comprehension axiom
of NBG only allows formulas that do not quantify over classes, so I
don't think this construction can be done in NBG.  Note that while NBG
is conservative over ZFC (it can't prove any new theorems about sets),
MK is not.

All of these problems go away, of course, if you assume a Grothendieck
universe U and replace your sets by U-small sets and your classes by
U-large ones.

I'm not sure if this is quite what you're looking for, but my paper "Set
theory for category theory" addresses some of these issues
(arXiv:0810.1279).

Best,
Mike
