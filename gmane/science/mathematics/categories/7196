FOURTH WORKSHOP ON FORMAL TOPOLOGY (4WFTop)
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

The workshop on formal topology is an international meeting dedicated
to formal topology and related topics, including constructive and
computable topology, point-free topology, and other generalizations of
topology.

This is the fourth of a series of successful meetings on the
development of Formal Topology and its connections with related
approaches. The first three have been held in Padua (1997), Venice
(2002), and Padua (2007).

TUTORIAL DAY

June 15th 2012 will be dedicated to tutorials on topics in and around
formal topology, suitable for researchers and graduate students
without in-depth knowledge of the area. They will be given by:

* Thierry Coquand (Chalmers University)
* Erik Palmgren (Stockholm University)
* Giovanni Sambin (University of Padua)
* Steven Vickers (University of Birmingham)

The workshop is supported by:

* Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Ljubljana
* Institute of mathematics, physics and mechanics, Ljubljana


HIGHER DIMENSIONAL ALGEBRA, CATEGORIES AND TYPES
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The Workshop on formal topology will be followed by a one-day workshop
on higher dimensional algebra, categories and types, organized by

* Nicola Gambino
* Niel Ghani
* Zhaohui Luo
* Randy Pollack
* Urs Schreiber
* Bas Spitters
* Thomas Streicher

The importance of higher dimensional structure for mathematics and
computer science has been recognized for a long time. However, recent
connections between homotopy theory and type theory have spurred new
activity that is connecting previously unrelated topics. The workshop
will be a place for meeting and dissemination of ideas between
researchers from different areas who all use higher dimensional
structures.

More information on participation and submission will follow.
