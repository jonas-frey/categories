Dear George,

I thank you for your message.

It is difficult to know. The Boubaki group had shielded itself
in secrecy, like a free mason cell.=20
You are surely aware of the interview of Pierre Cartier=20
in the Mathematical Intelligencer No1 1998.=20
Everyone interested in the history of Bourbaki should read it.

http://ega-math.narod.ru/Bbaki/Cartier.htm

Let me stress a few passages:=20

>The fourth generation was more or less a group of students of =
Grothendieck. But at that time Grothendieck had already left Bourbaki.=20
>He belonged to Bourbaki for about ten years but he left in anger. The =
personalities were very strong at the time.=20
>I remember there were clashes very often. There was also, as usual, a =
fight of generations, like in any family.=20
>I think a small group like that repeated more or less the psychological =
features of a family.=20
>So we had clashes between generations, clashes between brothers, and so =
on.=20
>But they did not distract Bourbaki from his main goal, even though they =
were quite brutal occasionally.=20
>At least the goal was clear. There were a few people who could not take =
the burden of this psychological style,=20
>for instance Grothendieck left and also Lang dropped out.


> It is amazing that category theory was more or less the brainchild of =
Bourbaki. The two founders were Eilenberg and MacLane.=20
> MacLane was never a member of Bourbaki, but Eilenberg was, and MacLane =
was close in spirit. The first textbook on homo-logical=20
>algebra was Cartan-Eilenberg, which was published when both were very =
active in Bourbaki. Let us also mention Grothendieck, who=20
>developed categories to a very large extent. I have been using =
categories in a conscious or unconscious way in much of my work,=20
>and so had most of the Bourbaki members. But because the way of =
thinking was too dogmatic, or at least the presentation in the=20
>books was too dogmatic, Bourbaki could not accommodate a change of =
emphasis, once the publication process was started.

>In accordance with Hilbert's views, set theory was thought by Bourbaki =
to provide that badly needed general framework. If you need=20
> some logical foundations, categories are a more flexible tool than set =
theory. The point is that categories offer both a general=20
> philosophical foundation=97that is the encyclopedic, or taxonomic =
part=97and a very efficient mathematical tool, to be used in=20
>mathematical situations. That set theory and structures are, by =
contrast, more rigid can be seen by reading the final chapter in=20
>Bourbaki set theory, with a monstrous endeavor to formulate categories =
without categories.


The interview ends with the following passage.
The bold faces are from me.

>When I began in mathematics the main task of a mathematician was to =
bring order and make a synthesis of existing material, to create=20
>what Thomas Kuhn called normal science. Mathematics, in the forties and =
fifties, was undergoing what Kuhn calls a solidification period.=20
>In a given science there are times when you have to take all the =
existing material and create a unified terminology, unified standards,=20
>and train people in a unified style. The purpose of mathematics, in the =
fifties and sixties, was that, to create a new era of normal science.=20
>Now we are again at the beginning of a new revolution. Mathematics is =
undergoing major changes. We don't know exactly where it will go.
> It is not yet time to make a synthesis of all these things=97MAYBE IN =
TWENTY OR THIRTY CENTURY IT WILL BE TIME FOR A NEW BOURBAKI.
>I consider myself very fortunate to have had two lives, a life of =
normal science and a life of scientific revolution.

Is it the time for a new Bourbaki?

Best regards,=20

Dear Andree,

Could you please explain this better?:

The only Bourbaki member I new personally was Sammy Eilenberg. As many =
of
us, I knew him very well and I would say that he was more skeptical =
about
the Bourbaki Tractate then one can conclude from Andre's message. Having =
in
mind not just this but the content of Bourbaki's "Homological algebra" =
and
what we see today from the followers of that Bourbaki group, I protest
against Andre's "two options" and I insist that Bourbaki group simply =
did
not see the importance of category theory (in spite of being brilliant
mathematicians, as I said in my previous message). I hope Andre will =
forgive
me and even agree with me.

However, there were three great category-theorists in that group (plus =
there
is this mysterious story about Chevalley's book of category theory lost =
in
the train), and "did not see" cannot be said about them of course. On =
the
other hand I have never heard of any joint work of Charles Ehresmann =
with
any of the two others, Eilenberg and Grothendieck (and nothing jointly =
from
them). I think apart from the time issues you describe, the relationship
between Bourbaki Tractate and category theory should have been =
determined by
their separate or joint influence and therefore also by their =
communication
with each other (if any).

Is this true, and could you please give details?

Respectfully, and with best regards-

George
