In Categories and Alligators (1.733, pg 124), an object in a pre-logos is
called CONNECTED if it has exactly two complemented subobjects. They observe
that in Sh(Y), the terminator is connected iff Y is a connected space. A
PRE-LOGOS (pag 98) is a regular category in which Sub(A) is a lattice (not
just a semi-lattice) for each A, and in which f#:Sub(B)---> Sub(A) is a
lattice homomorphism for each f:A--->B.



For a Grothendieck topos e:E---> S (over an arbitrary base S), this
definition admits a generalization with "complemented subobject" replaced by
"definable subobject", that is, subobjects classified by <e^*Omega_S, true>
which, in case S is Boolean, agrees with the Freyd-Scedrov definition. I do
not know if this is the sort of abstraction you want.


Now for something (not) entirely different:

A related notion to the one above is the notion of "abstractly (exclusively)
unary" introduced in my thesis (Categories of Set-Valued Functors,
University of Pennsylvania, 1966) as part of the definition of an "atom".

An object A in a "regular category" X (in the sense of my thesis, which,
modulo the stability assumptions is the same as Barr exact) is "abstractly
(exclusively) unary"
if every A---> \Sum {X_i} in C factors through one (and only one) injection.
(The difference with connected is that arbitrary coproducts must be
considered and, unlike what I assert in Proposition 11.8, finiteness does
not imply this --incorrect use of Zorn's lemma. )

An object A is an "atom" in a "regular category" X  if HOM(A,-):X--->Set
preserves colimits, thus also the coproducts which exist in X. In
particular, A is abstractly (exclusively) unary. More in particular, every
A---> B + C  factors uniquely trhough one of the injections. The latter is
itself equivalent in this context to every A---> 1 + 1 factors uniquely
through one of the injections.

Just for completeness I state what is shown in my thesis. A "regular"
category X is said to be "atomic" is the class of atoms in it is a set and
is generating for X. (The funny thing is that almost all the terminology
from my thesis was subsequently abandoned -- "atom" was relaced by "A.T.O."
(provided exponentiation exists), and "atomic" had a quite different
meaning. ) In any case, my theorem reads (all terminology as in my thesis):

THM. (Characterization theorem) Let X be any cocomplete atomic regular
category. Then there exists a small category C and a functor X--> S^{C^op}
which is an equivalence of categories. Conversely every category of
set-valued functors S^{C^op} is cocomplete regular atomic.

Note: the terminology introduced in my thesis was motivated by the intended
theorem which is of the sort "every complete atomic Boolean algebra is
isomorphic to a field of sets" (meaning the "field" of all subsets of its
set of atoms).

There is no published version of my thesis except for microfilms something.
The relative version (relative to a monoidal category V) of this
characterization theorem is published in Marta Bunge, Relatived Functor
Categories and Categories of Algebras, J. Algebra 11 (1), January 1969,
63-101 (communicated by Saunders MacLane).


I am sure that I have expanded way more than you would have wanted.
Apologies are in order.
Cordially,
Marta
