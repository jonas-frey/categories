Well in my limited knowledge I can say that a lot of category theory had been
employed in order to design many constructions for programming languages.

For instance in Haskell the notion of category, functor and monads
are used as typeclasses in order to abstract some general pattern
lurking around in many parametric types.
So from this perspective category theory gives to (real world) programmers
some tools to produce abstract-reusable-patterns, to code and avoid boilerplate.

There is also Spivak's program to treat database categorically: yeah I know
this is research, nonetheless it has to do with modelling real world objects
(database) and modelling data is part (if not the essence) of real world application
of mathematics.

There are also other researcher that are trying to find categorical models for real
world objects (see Baez's work for instance). I don't know if these works are yet
ready for real world applications, but they seems promising.

Hope this helps.
