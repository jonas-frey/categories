Some more comments.=0A=
=0A=
I always imagined that Penrose was inspired by Feynman's diagrams,=0A=
but Max's story is casting doubts on this idea; Penrose=0A=
may have been chiefly concerned with the syntax of tensor calculus.=0A=
=0A=
Let me point out that Eduardo Dubuc invented an "elevator calculus" in =0A=
the early 70's which is a form of the string diagram notation.=0A=
It was never published.=0A=

A short note: This idea that string diagrams are, due to technical=0A=
issues, only useful for private calculation, is said explicitly by=0A=
Penrose. Penrose and Rindler's book "Spinsors and Spacetime" (CUP=0A=
1984) has an 11-page appendix full of all sorts of beautiful,=0A=
carefully hand-drawn graphical notation for tensors and various=0A=
operations on them (e.g. anti-symmetrization and covariant=0A=
derivative).=0A=

Some random comments:=0A=

The person who told me of the Penrose-Rindler reference and the earlier=0A=

was Iain Aitchison who found a coloured string-diagram Pascal-triangle-like=
   algorithm for producing the n-cocycle condition arising from the oriental=
s  and their cubical analogues. While Iain's more recent=0A=
=0A=
The geometry of oriented cubes, arXiv:1008.1714v1 [math.CT]=0A=
=0A=
has incredible diagrams in comparison with 1984 technology, the string vers=
ions are not there.=0A=
=0A=
Speaking of Roger Penrose, Max Kelly used to tell the following story about=
   their time (mid 1950s) in Cambridge. Max thought Roger must be very visua=
lly impaired. Two reasons:=0A=
=0A=
1. When Max first met him he was wearing very thick glasses. It turned out =
Roger was conducting an experiment to test whether one would adapt to weari=
ng lenses that inverted the world. After a few days apparently the brain ad=
justs and it believes everything is the right way up.=0A=
=0A=
2. Looking over Roger's shoulder on lectures using tensors, Max noticed tha=
t Penrose was not using the usual notation at all. He was using the string =
notation instead. When Max asked why, Roger said that all the i_1, j_2, 1_1=
, . . . sub- and super-scripts were impossible to read, whereas the connect=
ing strings made it clear.=0A=
=0A=
Who knows what lies in one's subconscience! However, I think the string not=
ation Max used when talking about his work with Eilenberg on extraordinary =
natural transformations (not the more general Set-based dinatural transform=
ations Dubuc and I wrote about) arose quite independently of Max's Penrose =
experience. Sometimes when Graeme Segal was in Sydney, I was around while h=
e and Max discussed comparisons of the Eilenberg-Kelly string diagrams=0A=
=0A=
(which do not appear in their paper: A generalization of the functorial cal=
culus, Jour. Algebra 3 (1966) 366--375)=0A=

and string diagrams in physics.=0A=
