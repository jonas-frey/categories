PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT

                                CiE 2007

   Computability in Europe 2007: Computation and Logic in the Real World

      Department of Mathematics and Computer Science "Roberto Magari"
                          University of Siena
                         Siena, 18-23 June 2007

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission of papers: Jan. 12, 2007
Notification of authors: Feb. 16, 2007
Deadline for final revisions: Mar. 9, 2007

The Third Conference CiE 2007, organised by CiE (Computability in
Europe) will take place at the University of Siena, June 18-23 2007.

CiE is a European network of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists,
philosophers, theoretical physicists and others interested in new developments
in computability and in their underlying significance for the real world.

CiE 2007 will address various aspects of  the  ways  computability  and
theoretical computer science enable scientists and philosophers to deal
with mathematical and  real  world  issues,  ranging  through  problems
related to logic, mathematics, physical processes, real computation and
learning theory. At the same time it will focus on  different  ways  in
which  computability  emerges from the real world, and how this affects
our way of thinking about everyday computational issues.

CiE 2007 will be co-located with the annual CCA (Computability and Complexity
in Analysis) Conference (Siena, College Santa Chiara, June 16-18, 2007):

                      http://cca-net.de/cca2007/

The PROGRAMME COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers (European and
non-European) in computability related areas to submit their papers (in
PDF-format, max 10 pages) for presentation at CiE 2007. We particularly invite
papers that build bridges between different parts of the research community.

The CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS will be published by LNCS, Springer Verlag. There
will also be journal special issues, collecting invited contributions related
to the conference.

The conference is sponsored by EATCS, ASL, EACSL, and AILA (Italian Association
of Logic and Applications).
