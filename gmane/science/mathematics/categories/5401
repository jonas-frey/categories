Here are some comments on the discussion about category theory:

1. I testify that categories can be fruitfully introduced to =20
undergraduates. In the late sixties, I followed 3 cohorts of students =20
from their entrance at the university (just after the Baccalaureat) up =20
to their graduation. I introduced category theory in the mid of their =20
first year and thoroughly used it later on in my courses on Algebra, =20
Topology, Differential Calculus and functional spaces, and Algebraic =20
Topology. (All these courses have been multigraphed in Amiens.) Since =20
the university in Amiens was only beginning to develop, there were not =20
many students, but most of them seemed to enjoy categories and about =20
10% of those who completed the cycle went on to do research (generally =20
using categories) and obtained university positions.
However I had to stop my experiment because several of my colleagues =20
did not appreciate categories:(t was a very bad time for them in =20
France in the early 70's.

2. Applications of categories begin to be welcomed in the most varied =20
scientific domains. An example is our general model "Memory Evolutive =20
Systems" for 'natural' complex autonomous systems, such as biological =20
or social systems; when we first introduced it in the 90's, people =20
were somewhat skeptical, but now more people accept it, in particular =20
cognitive scientists are taking a real interest in its application to =20
cognitive systems (our model MENS).

3. Thus, though one of the older living "veterans" of the 60's "war", =20
I am not pessimistic (as John Baez seems to imply). I think my =20
generation has lost a battle, partially because of too much =20
precipitation and not always enough diplomacy, but I feel that the =20
youngsters are winning the war and I'ld try to help them as much as =20
possible for I have kept all my enthusiasm.

So best wishes to the categories and to all their friends for 2010
Andree
