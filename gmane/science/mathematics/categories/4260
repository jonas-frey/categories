I have made some minor contributions to wikipedia with information on for
example John Robinson, on groupoids, Grothendieck, and the van Kampen
theorem. The last three link to my web site and my counter (which registers
`came from') shows the utility of these links, among many others.

In the past a text had to assume or give an account of basic material. Why
give an account of say Yoneda when there is a reasonable one on  wiki which
a reader can download?

So I would encourage category theorists to develop the accounts.



Ronnie
