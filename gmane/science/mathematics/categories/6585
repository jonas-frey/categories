Dear Andrej,

For example: take B to be the circle and E' its Moebius double cover,
which has no global sections. Then for every x in B you can take U = B
and your condition holds vacuously for any f whatsoever.

If E = E'+E' then the codiagonal f has your property but is not mono.

Regards,

Steve.
