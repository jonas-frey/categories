David Roberts writes:
----------------------
In a suitable bicategory of topological groupoids (where internal weak
equivalences a la Bunge-Pare or Everaert-Kieboom///-/van der Linden are
formally inverted) the topologised fundamental groupoid is equivalent to
a groupoid sans topology - in fact it is equivalent to itself where the
topology is replaced by the discrete topology. The topologised
fundamental groupoid in this way encodes only the 1-type of the space.
-------------------------

Isn't this a bit like a sledgehammer to crack a nutshell?

The fact is that if X has a universal cover then the topologised
fundamental groupoid is such that
(s,t): \pi_1(X)  \to X \times X
is a covering map, so one easily determines  that the  fundamental
groups of \pi_1(X) are determined by those of x.

So some new ideas are needed to get at the 2-type of X.

I'd like to use this occasion to advertise  some of the aims of
Grothendieck's writings in the 1980s in the following excerpt, and which
may even be relevant to David's  question in this thread (??!):

In a letter dated 02/05/1983 Alexander Grothendieck wrote:

"Don't be surprised by my supposed efficiency in digging out the right
kind of notions--I have just been following, rather let myself be pulled
ahead, by that very strong thread (roughly: understand non commutative
cohomology of topoi!) which I kept trying to sell for about ten or
twenty years now, without anyone ready to ``buy'' it, namely to do the
work. So finally I got mad and decided to work out at least an outline
by myself."

This is relevant to `Pursuing Stacks',  and to `Derivateurs', for both
of which see work by Georges Maltsiniotis.

I had found that groupoids were in some sense more powerful than
nonabelian cohomology,  so in higher dimensions looked for, and
eventually found, higher groupoids and colimit results, giving more
information than could seemingly be obtained from exact sequences.
