Dear Ettore and Marco
Much of your very interesting paper is actually taking place in an unjustly=
  neglected topos.
The classifying topos for nontrivial Boolean algebras is concretely just pr=
esheaves on nonempty finite sets. It was one of two examples in my 1988 Mac=
quarie talk "Toposes generated by codiscrete objects in=20
algebraic topology and functional analysis" *
Like many non-localic toposes=2C this one unites pair of identical  but adj=
ointly opposite copies of the base topos of abstract sets=2Cnamely a subtop=
os of codiscretes and its negation=2C the subcategory ofdiscretes or consta=
nt presheaves. Because in this very special casethe Yoneda inclusion is a r=
estriction of  the codiscrete inclusion=2C it is well justified to consider=
  this topos as "codiscretely generated " (wrt colimits).
This topos contains the category of groupoids as a full reflective subcateg=
ory.In fact the reflector preserves finite products=2C and is a refinement =
of the syntax for presenting groups. It should probably be considered as th=
e fundamental combinatorial Poincare functor .
That point of view requires viewing the objects of the topos as combinatori=
al spaces=2C which  is out of fashion even though afull coreflective subcat=
egory is that of classical simplicial complexes ( or "simplicial schemes"ac=
cording to Godement).  The fear is that geometric realization will not be e=
xact. But as Joyal and Wraith pointed out 30 years ago=2C one need only rep=
lace the usual interval  with the weakinfinite-dimensional sphere as basic =
parameterizer (of Zitterbewegungen instead of ordinary paths ?) in order to=
  obtain  a geometric mo=10rphism of the singular/realization kind from any =
reasonable topological topos.
Actually the groupoids  are already at a low level in the sequence ofessent=
ial subtoposes: if the trivial topos is taken as level minus infinity=2Cthe=
  discrete as level zero=2C and the lowest level whose skeleton functor dete=
cts connectivity as level one=2C then the lowest level whose UIAO is compat=
ible seems to be three.  Explicit consideration of the role of the groupoid=
s may a  help in calculating the precise Aufhebung  function.
Best wishesBill
*the other example was the Gaeta topos on countably  infinite sets=2C close=
ly related to the Kolmogoroff-Mackey bornological generalizations ofBanach =
spaces=2C which are  vector space objects in that topos.
