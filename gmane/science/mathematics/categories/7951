Dear categoricists,

It is well known that higher category theory has applications in homotopy
(Work of Joyal, Lurie, Grothendieck conjecture, etc.).

May someone gives me some references about probable applications of higher
category theory in other areas ? I guess in computer science and
other areas (rewriting ? etc.), they are probably some works !?

Thank you very much to give me these references and for your help !

Best regards,
Camell.
