Dear fellow categorists,=20


Preamble.=20

I have a question that is the key to getting the (co)KZ-monad Tau on the op=
posite R of the 2-category bounded S-toposes =E2=80=9Cjust as=E2=80=9D Sigm=
a was defined in Bunge-Carboni =E2=80=9CThe symmetric topos=E2=80=9D in 199=
5. In turn, just as taking opposites to Sigma gives the KZ-monad M on BTop_=
S, pursued in several papers including the Bunge-Funk 2006 book, Singular C=
overings of Toposes.  In my =E2=80=9CPitts monads and a lax descent theorem=
=E2=80=9D (2015)  I used M to derive that S-essental surjections of toposes=
  are of effective descent, (a result due to Pitts (1986), along with other =
known and unknown (lax)descent theorems, moreover in a unified manner. The =
goal here is to do likewise by taking opposites to Tau, thus giving a (co)-=
KZ monad N on BTop_S, to be used among other things, to derive that relativ=
ely tidy surjections of toposes are of effective lax descent, a result due =
to Moerdijk and Vermeulen (2000).  In the Bunge-Carboni paper, Sigma was ob=
tained as the left adjoint to the forgetful R=E2=80=94> A, where A was the =
2-category of locally presentable categories and cocontinuous functors as m=
orphisms. It involved a lex completion at the level of the sites. The key t=
hen was simply to know that coinverters in R and in A both existed and that=
  those in R could be calculated in A. We took the word of Max Kelly and And=
y Pitts that this was indeed the case. Dually, Tau (if it existed) should b=
e the left adjoint to the forgetful R=E2=80=94> B, where B now is the 2-cat=
egory of locally presentable categories with lex and filtered colimit prese=
rving functors as morphisms.=20

The Question.=20

Let B be the 2-category of locally presentable categories with lex and filt=
ered colimit preserving functors as morphisms. Let R be the opposite of the=
  2-category BTop_S of bounded S-toposes, geometric morphisms and 2-cells. D=
o coinverters in B exist? If so,  are those in R calculated just as in B? I=
f not, is there a known class of toposes, strictly larger than that of the =
coherent toposes, for which this is the case?

Further comments.

The locales version of an answer to my question is in the Johnstone-Vickers=
  paper =E2=80=9CPreframe presentations present=E2=80=99 (1991) but, just as=
  with Carboni we did not look at suplattices for an inspiration of how to g=
et Sigma, I do not want to do likewise for Tau looking at locale preframes,=
  as the transition from locales to toposes is not perfect. Let me point out=
   howevet that the case of N restricted to coherent toposes is easy in that=
  setting, as the sites of coherent toposes are categories with finite limit=
s already, so that the frame completion involves only adding finite colimit=
s, unlike the frame completion of a preframe which involves adding both fin=
ite limits and filtered colimits (plus the distributive aspect).  I recentl=
y learnt that also Steve Vickers and Christopher Townsend have been looking=
  for this N for a long time and after learning about the symmetric monad (S=
igma and M). Steve, who wrote to categories about it last week, is actually=
   looking for the geometric counterpart of (the points of) an N(E) for E a =
topos, just as the complete spreads with a locally connected domain are the=
  counterpart of  the Lawvere distributions on toposes, that is, of (the poi=
nts)  of M(E).=20

Conclusion.

Any concrete pointers to an answer will be appreciated. I am aware that the=
re would be other ways to tackle this completion-cocompletion matter (bicom=
pletions, distributive laws) if it were just a matter of getting N, but not=
  so for my current purpose as I explained above.=20

Best wishes,
Marta
