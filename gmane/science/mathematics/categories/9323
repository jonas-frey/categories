Many of you were very generous in sharing examples with me when I =
started writing =E2=80=9CCategory theory in context=E2=80=9D but my very =
favorite, the one I tend to lead with in conversation to whet appetites, =
is an application of the Yoneda lemma to high-school level matrix =
algebra that I learned from Fred. I=E2=80=99ll let him tell you about it =
in his own words. Because his correspondence is so charming I=E2=80=99ve =
included it in full, following an excerpted version of my original =
email.

My sincerest condolences to those who had the opportunity to spend more =
time with him than I did. He will be missed.

Hi all,

I am writing in hopes that I might pick the collective brain of the =
categories list. This spring, I will be teaching an undergraduate-level =
category theory course, entitled =E2=80=9CCategory theory in context.=E2=80=
=9D

It has two aims:=20

(i) To provide a thorough =E2=80=9CCambridge-style=E2=80=9D introduction =
to the basic concepts of category theory: representability, (co)limits, =
adjunctions, and monads.

(ii) To revisit as many topics as possible from the typical =
undergraduate curriculum, using category theory as a guide to deeper =
understanding.

=E2=80=A6

Over the past few months I have been collecting examples that I might =
use in the course, with the focus on topics that are the most =
=E2=80=9Csociologically important=E2=80=9D (to quote Tom Leinster=E2=80=99=
s talk at CT2014) and also the most illustrative of the categorical =
concept in question. (After all, aim (i) is to help my students =
internalize the categorical way of thinking!)

...

I would be very grateful to hear about other favorite examples which =
illustrate or are clarified by the categorical way of thinking. My view =
of what might be accessible to undergraduates is relatively expansive, =
particularly in the less-obviously-categorical areas of mathematics such =
as analysis.

...

Best wishes to all for a happy and productive new year.

Hi, Emily,

I suppose I would be remiss not to point out all the examples your=20
fellow Cambridge co-citizen David Spivak offers in his recent text,
Category Theory for the Sciences (MIT Press).

And then there's the Yoneda Lemma embodied in the classical Gaussian
row reduction observation, that a given row reduction operation (on
matrices with say k rows) being a "natural" operation (in the sense=20
of natural transformations) is just multiplication (on the appropriate
side) by the effect of that operation on the k-by-k identity matrix.

And dually for column-reduction operations :-) .

Cheers, -- Fred

I love it. Thanks :)

And I=E2=80=99ll check out the Spivak book.

Hi, Emily,

You're welcome.

While you're there (f.d. real/complex vector spaces and linear =
x-formations,
vs. real/complex matrices), exploit the connection between the Lawverian
theory (objects the natural numbers k, n, m, l, etc., and morphisms n -> =
k
the k-by-n matrices, with usual matrix mult'n) and the category of f.d.=20=

vector spaces proper, with linear x-formations as morphisms. The latter
is the category of algebras over the former, but the former is a =
skeleton=20
("every f.d.v.sp. has a basis") of the latter, as well.

The Gauss/Yoneda observation I tend to see occurring in that skeleton.

And another example that matrices illustrate: the middle-interchange =
law:

think A $ B as the row-lengthening procedure taking two matrices
with =3D number (say k) of rows (say k-by-n and k-by-m) and delivering=20=

the k-rowed matrix whose rows, of length n+m, all start out being the
corresponding row of A and finish by becoming that of B; and A # A'
the column-lengthening procedure taking two matrices with =3D number =
(say n)
of columns (say k-by-n and l-by-n) and yielding the obvious (k+l)-by-n =
one.

(Linear algebra texts introduce those ideas implicitly when they deal
with "block decompositions".) Anyway, it's clear -- for matrices A, A',
B, B' of the matching (size/shape)s, one has:

(A $ B) # (A' $ B') =3D (A # A') $ (B # B').

I'm sure you'll find plenty more such illustrations here. I hope your=20
Harvard kids eat them up with better appetite than my Wesleyan kids did.

I particularly like the Vector space =E2=80=94 Matrix equivalence of =
categories. It=E2=80=99s one of my favorite examples.=20

Yes; it's unusual to have a variety of finitary algebras equivalent=20
to its Lawverian theory, as also to have a monad whose Kleisli category=20=

and Eilenberg-Moore category are equivalent (!) . Well, run with it,=20
for a "touchdaown" :-) .

> I have no idea what to make of this:

Food for thought. You know very well that, when it comes to proper,
every-where defined binary operations with unit (call them + and &, =
say),
as soon as (a + b) & (a' + b') =3D (a & a') + (b & b'), then you soon =
see
the units agree, and then b & a' =3D a' + b =3D a' & b, whence also + =3D =
&=20
and it's commutative.

But $ and #, below, are no longer "everywhere defined" (unless you
restrict to the case n =3D m =3D k =3D l =3D 0).

Illustrating in a tiny instance that ASCII artwork can handle easily,
and letting A, B, A', and B' be

a b

c

p q
r s

and=20

x
y

respectively, A $ B becomes

a b c ,

A' $ B' becomes

p q x
r s y ,

and both=20

(A $ B) # (A' $ B') and (A # A') $ (B # B') become

a b c
p q x
r s y .
