Dear Christopher

Your lemma is a combination of 2 results in the literature. The first is Pro=
position(13) of

1. R. Street and B. Walters, Yoneda structures on 2-categories,
Journal of Algebra 50:350-379, 1978

which says that for a functor J:B-->C between locally small categories, the f=
unctor
PB(C(J,1),1):PB-->PC
corresponds to taking right kan extension along J -- here PB=3D[B^op,Set], C=
(J,1):C-->PB sends (b,c) to the hom set C(Jb,c). Your lemma is the case J=3D=
K (the comparison functor), and one uses the result that K is dense, due to =
Fred Linton

2. F. Linton, Relative functorial semantics: adjointness results,
LNM 99:384-418, 1969

to simplify the right kan extension to the F(A,a) of your lemma. Often there=
  are nice subcategories of C_T which are also dense in C^T, and this would g=
ive other variants of your lemma. For more on this kind of situation see

http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.3064

With best regards,
Mark Weber
