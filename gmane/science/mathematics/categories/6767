I think that the list of topics is very good, and the idea seems to me
very reasonnable.

And with all my respect to Eduardo ("No censorship to wikipedia !") I
don't think
that everything should be reduced to mere opinions and freedom of speech
- there is
also the notion of truth. Supposedly, the above mentioned freedom should
help
to find it, at least, in science.

Best regards
