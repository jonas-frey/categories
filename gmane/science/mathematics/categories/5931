---and I have further noticed that, although the first
situation may encompass the other two, this is by the by,
since the argument in this first situation is incorrect. I
have only shown the vertex of the pullback to be accessible,
but not necessarily locally presentable. I don't see any
obvious way of rectifying this. However, the argument in the
second and third situations is still valid. So to
summarise:--

Given a cospan of locally presentable categories and
accessible functors,
- if one of the functors is an isofibration, then the
pullback is accessible;
- if one of the functors is monadic or comonadic, then the
pullback is locally presentable.
