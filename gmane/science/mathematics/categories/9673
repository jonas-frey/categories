Many thanks to those who responded with suggestions. I won=E2=80=99t =
repeat replies that were also sent to categories@mta.ca, but there were =
a couple sent privately that I pass on:

Peter Johnstone reminded me of the fact that category-theorists tend to =
use the prefix =E2=80=9Cweak=E2=80=9D to remove the uniqueness part of a =
unique existence condition. So one could speak of "weak sheaves". (A =
slight problem with that is that when I say it, it sounds a lot like =
wheat sheaves :-).)

Tom Hirschowitz pointed out that there is the concept of effective =
descent data in stack theory, so one might use the term =E2=80=9Ceffective=
  presheaf=E2=80=9D for what I was referring to. I quite like that.
