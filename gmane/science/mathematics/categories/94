             Formal Aspects of Component Software (FACS 2009)

                                  First Call for Papers

  6th International Workshop on Formal Aspects of Component Software

                                 November 2-3, 2009
                           Eindhoven, the Netherlands

                       http://www.iist.unu.edu/facs09/

                   Submission deadline June 19, 2009

Scope & Topics:

    Component-based software has emerged as a promising paradigm to deal
    with the ever increasing need for mastering systems' complexity,
    for enabling evolution and reuse, and for bringing sound production
    and engineering standards into software engineering. However, many
    issues in component-based software development remain open and
    pose challenging research questions.

    Formal methods consist of mathematically-based
    techniques for the specification, development and verification of
    software and hardware systems. They have shown their great utility
    for setting up the formal foundations of component software and working
    out challenging issues such as mathematical models for components,
    their composition and adaptation, or rigorous approaches to
    verification, deployment, testing and certification.

    The objective of FACS'09 is to bring together researchers in the
    areas of component software and formal methods to promote a deep
    understanding of this paradigm and its applications. The workshop
    will also be interested in defining the common aspects of
    components and component-based development. It is expected that
    formal paper presentations will be followed by lively
    discussions. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

    - formal models for software components and component interaction
    - design and verification methods for component software
    - component composition and deployment: models, calculi, languages
    - component testing, re-engineering and reuse
    - specification of extra-functional properties in component software
    - certification of components and software architectures
    - component software vs. object orientation, multi-agent systems, and
      aspect oriented development
    - components for real-time, safety-critical, secure and/or embedded 
systems
    - standard models for software components (e.g. Fractal, GCM, etc.)
    - industrial or experience reports, and case studies in component 
software
    - partial behavior models for software components
    - update and reconfiguration of component architectures
    - component systems evolution and maintenance
    - formal methods and modeling languages for components
    - trust models for components
    - autonomic components and self-managed applications
    - formal / rigorous approaches to software adaptation and 
self-adaptive systems
    - formal aspects of Web services and business processes
    - component-based Web services and service-oriented architectures
    - QoS issues in web services, multi-agent systems and 
component-based systems

    FACS'09 is the 6th event in a series of workshops, founded by
    the International Institute for Software Technology of the United
    Nations University (UNU-IIST). The first FACS workshop was
    co-located with FM'03 (Pisa, Italy, September 2003). The
    following FACS workshops were organised as standalone events,
    respectively at UNU-IIST in Macau (October 2005), at Charles
    University in Prague (September 2006), at INRIA in
    Sophia-Antipolis (September 2007), and at University of Málaga in
    Spain (September 2008). FACS'09 is planned to be co-located with
    a number of events together under the heading of Formal Methods Week
    (Eindhoven, the Netherlands, October 2009).

Submission & proceedings:

    Submissions to the workshop must present original research
    that is unpublished and not submitted for publication
    elsewhere. Papers will be judged on the basis of originality,
    relevance, technical soundness and presentation quality.  Papers
    must be written in English and not exceed 15 pages in the ENTCS
    format. Note that to encourage submission of work still in
    progress, we may also accept promising papers to be presented at
    the workshop. The presenters of these papers will be entitled to
    submit a revised version for full review for inclusion in the formal
    (post-)proceedings to be published in ENTCS. Extended versions of all
    accepted papers will be eligible for selection for a journal special
    issue.  The final version of the papers must be prepared in LaTeX,
    adhering to the ENTCS format (see http://www.entcs.org/final.html).

    Papers/abstracts can be submitted via the following link:
         http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=facs09

    A special issue consisting of extended versions of selected papers from
    FACS 2009 will be published in Science of Computer Programming. 
Selected
    participants will be invited to submit an extended version of their 
papers
    after the workshop. These extended versions will be reviewed by the
    international program committee of FACS'09, which will decide on their
    suitability for final publication in the special issue.

    Abstract submission: June 12, 2009
