Dear Colleagues,

Concerning Annual International Conference in Category Theory - CT2009 - in
Cape Town:

This is a very preliminary announcement (known to the participants of CT2008
in Calais):

The venue of CT2009 will be the Upper Campus of the University of Cape Town.

Opening of the Conference: Monday, 29 June 2009.

The last talk will be given before lunch on Saturday, 4 July 2009.

More information will follow in further announcements, first of which will
be sent in August 2008.

Concerning Max Kelly Volume of APCS:

Some of you told me in Calais, that they could submit a paper if the
deadline were a bit later than July 1. Please either submit your papers
before August 1, or let me know that you need a few more days.

George Janelidze
