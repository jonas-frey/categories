                           Journal of K-Theory

The Editorial Board of the "Journal of K-Theory" has the pleasure of
informing you that forthcoming articles are now available online at
http://www.journals.cambridge.org/jkt .The online and print issues of the
journal will start in January/February 2008.

The board apologizes, especially to the authors of manuscripts
submitted in the recent past, for the confusion, delays, and inadequate
communication arising during the transition of the board from the
journal "K-Theory"

The profits to be realized by the journal will serve as a basis for
an international conference in K-theory during the academic year 2010-
2011 in conjunction with Andrei Suslin's 60th birthday. Chances are
that additional funds can be found to augment JKT funding.

The long term commitment of the journal is to use profits derived
from publishing to support educational and scientific activities
concerning K-theory.
