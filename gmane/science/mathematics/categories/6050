a query is a formula (defining a  derived table) rather than a term

there are many types of non-equational constraints, for example,
inclusion P=3D>Q with P,Q formulas

a good question is what the place of SQL on the scale of logical
doctrines is. Since models of SQL-theories include predefined infinite
domains with operations (think of Integer and String), and  finite
domains for tables, model theory for SQL is not classical. I'm not
sure but it seems model-theorists call it "metafinite model theory"
(Gradel and Gurevich).

I took a look at the slides of  "databases are categories" talk. It
seems to be an overly simplified model.  Since an employee may work
for several or none departments, data should be modeled by a functor
into Rel rather than Set. 2-category structure may be important, and
we often have a lax functor F(a;b)<F(a);F(b). For example, a Person
_owns_ a Car, which is _parked_ at an Address, where the person
_lives_, but a Person may not have a Car but still _live_ at an
Address (arrow names are underlined, _lives=3Downs;parked_).
Considering all columns as foreign keys, that is, disregarding the
difference between value-valued and object-valued attributes, would
look very strange for a practitioner.
