That's right.  It's neither a category nor due to Freyd.

I think there were two reasons.

Firstly to portray the category of computations as being more
important than the category of values.

Secondly because an identity-on-objects functor between two categories
with the same objects can be regarded as an [ -> , Set ] enriched
category.  Here -> is the category with two objects and a morphism
between them (and identities).  This point is emphasized in John
Power's paper "Premonoidal categories as categories with algebraic
structure" in TCS in 2002.
