At first I thought there must have been some race condition here, until=20
I transformed all times including those on Fred's email header into UTC=20
(Universal Coordinated Time).  The relevant events in chronological=20
order are then

01:52, 14 September: User Selinger "clarified that images don't agree=20
with formula," by pointing out in the Wikipedia article that "Other=20
parametrizations are also possible, because knots are defined up to=20
continuous deformation. The illustrations on this page are derived from=20
various different parametrizations."

20:29, 17 September: User Vaughan Pratt "illustrated point about=20
different parametrizations" by appending to Peter's second sentence
": for example (leaving z unchanged) the (3,8)-torus knot uses r =3D=20
cos(q=CF=86) + 4 for a smoother effect while the (2,3)-torus knot avoids=20
inflexion points altogether by taking x + iy =3D r e^{p=CF=86i} =E2=88=92=
  3 e^{=E2=88=92=CF=86i}=20
where r =3D cos(q=CF=86) =E2=88=92 4."

06:58, 18 September: Fred posted to the categories list as above, namely=20
that the 14 September edit was insufficient and that the (2,3)-torus=20
knot is using a different *style* of parametrization.

Now Wikipedia edits are seen essentially instantaneously by all users.=20
Hence Fred must have based his complaint on the state of the article=20
10.5 hours before his post to this list, without checking whether the=20
current version still had that defect (e.g. by refreshing the page).

Since x + iy =3D re^{p=CF=86i} =E2=88=92 3e^{=E2=88=92=CF=86i} is merely =
the Euler-De Moivre=20
abbreviation for x =3D r cos(p=CF=86i) - 3 cos(=E2=88=92=CF=86i), y =3D r=
  sin(p=CF=86i) - 3=20
sin(=E2=88=92=CF=86i), I wouldn't call this a change in *style* from the =
original=20
parametrization of x =3D r cos(p=CF=86i), y =3D r sin(p=CF=86i).  (Now th=
at I think of=20
it, the abbreviation is not short enough to offset the loss of clarity=20
so I unabbreviated it just now.  All these changes can be tracked with=20
the article's history page, accessed via the History tab at the top.)

Fred's variable-ellipse representation of the "aflective"=20
(inflexion-point-free) trefoil that he posted to this list the other day=20
is certainly a change in style, regardless of whether it's equivalent to=20
some version of the original style.  But his claim that his is *the*=20
representation is called into question by the above parametrization,=20
which can be seen at http://boole.stanford.edu/Trefoil.jpg (actually I=20
changed it very slightly by decreasing "- 4" to "- 4.3", increasing "-=20
3" to "- 2.93", and rotating the figure 90 degrees clockwise, for a=20
closer match to the figure, but perhaps the figure should be changed=20
instead).

But whether the Wikipedia figure is a better match to my parametrization=20
or to Fred's is I would say moot given that there is no need to change=20
parametrization *style* to get an aflective trefoil, as should be clear=20
from http://boole.stanford.edu/Trefoil.jpg .

Even more puzzling to me is that prior to Fred's posting to this list on=20
this topic he had sent me 32 emails regarding his problem of drawing a=20
trefoil-shaped logo in Postscript, and I'd answered him 25 times, to his=20
complete satisfaction I thought.  That he then turned to the categories=20
list for further help with trefoils would seem to indicate that I'd been=20
less helpful than I thought.  I guess I can justify whatever he found=20
unhelpful with the observation that with free consulting you get what=20
you pay for.
