The 'groupoidal quotient' is also the fundamental groupoid of the category
considered as a homotopy type via the nerve. I would be tempted to call
what you have a covering 'space' of the category, as the category of all
these functors is equivalent to the category of
covering spaces of the geometric realisation of the nerve.
