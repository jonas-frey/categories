Dear Michael and all,

I am unaware of a great deal of the history of category theory in grant
funding.  The NSF declaration is troubling, especially since my colleague=
s
and I so far have had our category-theoretic proposals in cognitive
neuroscience rejected.  Some of the reviewers, though, did seem to find
favor with our use of category theory in relation to their subject; the
problem seems to have been more in other areas.  We haven't given up!

I regret not joining the FMCS crowd at UBC.  Too much work has resulted
from a prior commitment.

Best regards,
Mike
