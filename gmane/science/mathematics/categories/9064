Dear all,

My introductory textbook "Basic Category Theory" was published by
Cambridge University Press in 2014.  By arrangement with them, it's now
also free online:

    https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09375

It's also freely *editable*, under a Creative Commons licence.  For
instance, if you want to teach a class from it but some of the examples
aren't suitable, you can delete them or add your own.  Or if you don't
like the notation (and when have two category theorists ever agreed on
that?), you can easily change the Latex macros.  Just go the arXiv,
download, and edit to your heart's content.

There are lots of good introductions to category theory out there.  The
particular features of this one are:

* It's short.
* It doesn't assume much.
* It sticks to the basics.

Best wishes,
Tom
