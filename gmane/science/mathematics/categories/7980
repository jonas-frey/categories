This is the First Call for Papers for MFPS XXX. Details of the meeting =
are given below.=20

                     MFPS XXX
  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Conferences/MFPS30/

           Thirtieth Conference on the
          Mathematical Foundations of
             Programming Semantics

               Cornell University
                 Ithaca, NY USA
              12 - 15 June 2014

The Thirtieth Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics will take place on the campus of the
Cornell University, Ithaca, NY USA from June 12 through June 15, 2014.
MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic,
and computer science that are related to models of computation, in
general, and to the semantics of programming languages, in
particular. The series has particularly stressed providing a forum
where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and
exchange ideas about problems of common interest. As the series also
strives to maintain breadth in its scope, the conference strongly
encourages participation by researchers in neighboring areas.

TOPICS include, but are not limited to, the following: biocomputation;
concurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed systems; process
calculi; probabilistic systems; constructive mathematics; domain
theory and categorical models; formal languages; formal methods; game
semantics; lambda calculus; programming-language theory; quantum
computation; security; topological models; logic; type systems; type
theory. We also welcome contributions that address applications of
semantics to novel areas such as complex systems, markets, and
networks, for example.
