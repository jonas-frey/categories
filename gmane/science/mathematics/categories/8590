            A satellite event of CALCO 2015

            6th International Conference on
       Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science

              In cooperation with ACM SIGLOG

                  June 24 - 26, 2015

                 Nijmegen, Netherlands

              http://coalg.org/calco15/ei.html

==========================================================

        Submission:            May 8, 2015
        Author notification:   May 22, 2015
        Final version:         June 5, 2015

==========================================================

The programme of CALCO 2015 will include special sessions reserved for the
CALCO Early Ideas Workshop, featuring presentations of work in progress
and original research proposals. PhD students and young researchers
are particularly encouraged to contribute. Attendance at the workshop is
open to all conference participants.

The CALCO Early Ideas Workshop invites submissions on the same topics as
the CALCO conference: reporting results of theoretical work, the way these
results can support methods and techniques for software development, as well
as experience with the transfer of the resulting technologies into industrial
practice.

CALCO Early Ideas presentations will be selected according to originality,
significance, and general interest, on the basis of submitted 2-page short
contributions. It can be work in progress, a summary of work submitted to
a conference or workshop elsewhere, or work that in some other way might be
interesting to the CALCO audience. A booklet with the accepted short
contributions will be available at the workshop.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Submissions will be handled via the CALCO 2015 Early Ideas EasyChair site

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2015ei

and will be evaluated by the CALCO PC chairs. Submissions should be
no more than 2 pages long in the format specified by LIPIcs. The volume of
selected papers will be made available in the arXiv and on the CALCO pages.
Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged to disseminate the
results by subsequent publication elsewhere.
