Um, well, for arbitrary ideals I in a commutative ring R, R/I "extends to=
=20
a field" (or, in more common parlance, "is an integral domain") if and on=
ly=20
if I is a prime ideal; hence the previous assertion can be simplified to=20

  ring theorists define 0 to be a prime number because
  then they could define n to be prime just when nZ is a prime ideal.=20

which doesn't seem so unreasonable. =20

And I thought that every generation since Dedekind, Krull and Noether
knew that divisibility lattices are (in the general case) a red herring=20
and that it is the lattice of ideals of a ring (or its opposite, if you=20
prefer) which is really important.  Surely, it makes sense to fix=20
terminology according to what does work in the general case. =20

Although 0 can be a prime (depending on the ring under consideration),=20
it is plainly never "just another ordinary prime": there is a well-known
topology on the set of prime ideals of a commutative ring which clearly
distinguishes 0 from its fellows.  Perhaps the answer to your original=20
question is to take (finite-valued) sheaves on this space of primes,=20
although I don't really understand your motivation. =20
