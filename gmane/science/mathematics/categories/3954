I thought that I had explained my point of view clearly=20
enough, but apparently I haven't. =20

If A and B are (additive) subgroups of a ring R (commutative
or otherwise), then A.B is the image of the composite=20
  A @ B ---> R @ R --m-> R
(where @ denotes tensor product of abelian groups, and=20
m is the multiplication of the R, regarded as an arrow=20
in AbGp).  What is mysterious about this? =20

We have a functor AbGp ---> Pos which maps an abelian group
X to its set of subgroups; this uses only the existence of=20
an appropriate factorisation system on AbGp.  It is, in fact,=20
also a monoidal functor with Sub(X) x Sub(Y) ---> Sub(X @ Y)=20
defined by (A,B) |-> (the image of) A @ B ---> X @ Y.

Now regarding a ring as a monoidal functor 1 ---> AbGp,=20
we obtain a composite monoidal functor 1 ---> Pos, which=20
is a monoidal poset.  Specifically, the multiplication=20
on Sub(R) is defined by=20
  Sub(R) x Sub(R) ---> Sub(R @ R) --Sub(m)--> Sub(R)
which is exactly what I described earlier. =20

The mystery, if there is one, is why this monoidal poset
happens to be closed.  My explanation is that the monoidal
functor AbGp ---> Pos factors (as a monoidal functor) through
the monoidal forgetful functor Sup ---> Pos.  This can be=20
easily derived from the fact that AbGp is cocomplete and @=20
cocontinuous in each variable; in fact, weaker hypotheses=20
would seem to suffice. =20

Thus, again regarding a ring as a monoidal functor 1--->AbGp,
we can consider the composite monoidal functor 1--->Sup; which=20
is nothing more nor less than a monoidal closed poset that=20
happens to be (co)complete---and its underlying monoidal poset=20
(i.e., the composite 1--->Sup--->Pos) is Sub(R) by definition=20
... mystery solved!

Not quite, I hear you say: we want ideals, not arbitrary=20
additive subgroups---but Sub(R) retains enough information=20
of R to remember which of its elements are ideals and which=20
are not: an ideal is an additive subgroup A such that=20
T.A=3DT=3DA.T, where T denotes the top element of Sub(R)---namely,
R itself.  This is the "second stage" referred to in my=20
"Quantale Theory 101" post, which is the process of turning
a quantale into an "affine" quantale (one whose top element=20
is also its (multiplicative) unit).  In the commutative case,
at least, this poses no problem whatsoever.

I hope this clarifies my point of view on the Kummer functor.
I don't see its existence as having anything in particular to=20
do with commutative rings, but rather with those properties of=20
AbGp which cause the monoidal functor AbGp--->Pos to=20
  a) exist, and
  b) factor through the monoidal forgetful functor Sup--->Pos
---which, as I sketched above, are not particularly rare ones.
The rest is taken care of by a purely quantale-theoretic process.
[But my comment about Sup being an awesome category had more to do
with why the Kummer functor "should be" interesting (aside from=20
the obvious concrete considerations), rather than why it exists.]

I admit that this isn't entirely satisfying if you really are=20
interested in ideals as representing quotients of a ring; but=20
I do think that it is a valid perspective, nevertheless, and=20
welcome further discussion on the topic.

Cheers,
Jeff.
