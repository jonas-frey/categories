I will answer you in a Popperian key:  Large cardinals are falsifiable,
and are not yet falsified.  They may in fact be figments of our imaginations,
but then why do they keep on *working*?  Could be just a coincidence -- but
so could all other observation; that way lies the nullification of science
in general.

It's an illusion, by the way, to think that you can be rid of concerns about
consistency by dumping large cardinals, that you can thus achieve a priori
justification for apodictic certainty.  That doesn't exist even for the
natural numbers; Ed Nelson is quite right on this point.

As to the question of taxpayer funding, I will not attempt to justify
it (I'm a libertarian in politics), but will merely note that many
taxpayers probably feel that way about *all* pure mathematics.
