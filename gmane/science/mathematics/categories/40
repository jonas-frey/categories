It's not in the Elephant; but it's an easy exercise in primitive
recursion, given a coalgebra structure X \to X + X, to define the
transpose N x X \to 2 of the unique coalgebra morphism X \to 2^N.

How do you (constructively) give N^N the order type of the nonnegative
reals? I know how to give it the order type of the irrationals, but
that's still zero-dimensional. However, Freyd's presentation of the
real unit interval as a final coalgebra is done constructively (for any
topos with NNO) in the Elephant, D4.7.17.
