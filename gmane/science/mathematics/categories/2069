I am still trying to understand some enriched category theory.  Suppose
V is a closed symmetric monoidal category that is also locally
presentable.  Suppose C is a small V-category.  I am interested in the
category of V-functors from C to V, and, in particular, I want to know
that it is locally presentable.  Might need some hypotheses on C for
this, but I would prefer to avoid hypotheses on the actual functors.

This time I have actually looked in Kelly's book and I did not see it,
but I confess to finding this subject rough going so might have missed
it.  On the other hand, my library is closed for the holiday, so I have
not looked at Adamek and Rosicky's book on enriched category theory yet.

I guess the generators ought to be the representable functors.  I know
everything is a weighted colimit of representables, but I don't know
whether this colimit is filtered enough, nor do I know whether one can
get away with weighted colimits instead of ordinary ones.  

One direction this might go is to develop a theory of locally
presentable in an enriched sense, using weighted colimits instead of
colimits.  I would prefer to avoid that if possible.  

Happy holidays to all.
