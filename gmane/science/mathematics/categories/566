The 25th annual meeting  of  the European Association for  Theoretical
Computer    Science (EATCS) will  be  hosted  by the  Center for Basic
Research in  Computer Science (BRICS) at  Aalborg University.  Aalborg
is the fourth largest city in Denmark.

The  ICALP '98  Programme  Committee  represents both  tracks  of  the
journal Theoretical  Computer Science, covering  algorithms and formal
methods.  If enough good papers are  submitted, there will be parallel
sessions.  Papers  presenting  original contributions  in  any area of
theoretical computer science  are  being sought.  Topics  include (but
are not limited to):

  computability, automata, formal languages, new computing paradigms,
  term rewriting, analysis and design of algorithms, computational
  geometry, computational complexity, symbolic and algebraic
  computation, cryptography and security, data types and data
  structures, theory of data bases and knowledge bases, semantics of
  programming languages, program specification and verification,
  foundations of functional and logic programming, parallel and
  distributed computation, theory of concurrency, theory of robotics,
  theory of logical design and layout.

Authors are invited to submit seven copies of an extended abstract not
exceeding  12  pages by January 14,   1998.   Electronic submission of
papers    is  solicited.     Instructions     can    be  found      at

may submit a single copy of their abstract. Simultaneous submission of
papers    to  any journal   or  to  another  conference with published
proceedings is not allowed.
