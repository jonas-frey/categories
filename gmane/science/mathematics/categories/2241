	     Fields Institute Summer School and Workshops
		 Logic and Foundations of Computation

		     University of Ottawa, Canada
			   June 2-20, 2003

	    http://www.mathstat.uottawa.ca/lfc/fields2003/

			CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

	      Dormitory registration deadline: April 25

Dear Colleagues:

June will be theoretical computer science month at U. Ottawa! The
Fields Institute is sponsoring a summer school in Logic and
Foundations of Computation, which will take place in the 3 weeks
preceding the LICS conference at the University of Ottawa.  This
program will be hosted by the logic group in the Department of
Mathematics and Statistics (Philip Scott, Richard Blute, and Peter
Selinger), together with many distinguished visitors.

The program consists of 2 weeks of courses, then a week of research
workshops in several areas of theoretical computer science.

Courses (Morning and Afternoons) Include:
=========================================

Week 1: (i) Categorical Logic and (ii) Linear Logic (Taught by the
     Logic Group, with Guests: Thomas Ehrhard (Marseille), Robert
     Seely (McGill), Robin Cockett (Calgary), et al)

Week 2: (i) Game Semantics and (ii) Concurrency Theory. The courses
     are given by Samson Abramsky and Guy McCusker for (i), and Glynn
     Winskel for (ii).

Workshops:
==========

The program culminates in the 18th annual IEEE Logic in Computer
Science (LICS2003) meeting and LICS workshops, held from June 21-27 at
U. Ottawa.  For the latter, see http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/als/lics/.

To register, please follow the links on our website to the Fields
Institute, http://www.mathstat.uottawa.ca/lfc/fields2003/.

PLEASE NOTE: Special Dorm Accommodations (2 bedroom apartment suites)
must be prebooked by April 25, or they are lost and it's then on a
first-come, first-served basis.
