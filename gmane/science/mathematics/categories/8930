Dear colleagues.,
it is with great sorrow that I inform you that Sibe Mardesic passed two =
days ago in Zagreb, at the age of 90.
Although Sibe was not a categorist but a general and algebraic =
topologist, I am sure that most of you knew his name and possibly his =
work dedicated from the early 80=E2=80=99s to Shape and Strong Shape =
Theory. Anyway he was deeply aware of categorical methods as testified =
by the large amount of his papers,  the book  <Shape theory,  North =
Holland(1982)> with Jack Segal, finishing with the monumental <Strong =
shape and homology, Springer  (2000)>. He was the first to categorize =
Borsuk=E2=80=99s Shape theory adopting the =E2=80=9Cinverse system=E2=80=9D=
  approach. Less than one month ago he told me the he was hardly working =
on a problem concerning products in the strong shape category of =
topological spaces.
For all who had the pleasure and the honor tho know him and to work with =
him, Sibe leaves a great legacy of mathematical passion and rigour =
together with  a special humanity.
He his deeply missed by all his friends and colleagues all over the =
world.
Ciao Sibe, wherever you are now.
Luciano Stramaccia=
