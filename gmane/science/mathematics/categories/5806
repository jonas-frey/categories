I apologize for making a "mess" by including symmetry where it was not
supposed to be; I thought I was just repeating what I had heard
elsewhere.  Perhaps my memory was faulty, or perhaps someone else made
the same error (or mess).  Jeff's comment probably contributed to my
confusion too.  (I have read your very nice paper, but since I am only
interested in a few of the notions, I didn't take the trouble to
memorize all the different shadings of meaning.)  Thanks for setting
me straight.

I am happy with "symmetric autonomous," although I guess it loses out
to "compact" on the score of brevity.
