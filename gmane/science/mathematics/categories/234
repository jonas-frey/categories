Dear Tim,
    I just succeeded in getting in touch by phone with Eraldo,
after trying for quite a long time. Eraldo, his family and all the other
colleagues are fine. Eraldo lost a family flat in the center of the town,
but nobody was injured. He will not be able to be contacted by e-mail
for quite a long time, and is now staying in his house at the beach
nearby L'Aquila. Eraldo asked me to inform the colleagues and friends.
           Best wishes,
                               Aurelio.
