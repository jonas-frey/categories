POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN TYPE SYSTEMS FOR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science 
Division of Informatics
University of Edinburgh

Project Summary: 
================

The project has the following principal objectives: 

- To design new type systems encompassing algorithms and uses of data
structures which fall into desirable feasible complexity classes, but
which are prohibited by current such systems.

- To extract explicit resource bounds and certificates from typing
derivations.

- To investigate applications of the new type systems for compiler
technology.  To explore applications to non-functional programming,
e.g., OOP.

The full project description at
  http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mxh/epsrc_project.ps 
provides background material and further details.


Candidates: 
===========

All candidates should hold or soon complete a PhD in a related area of
Computer Science, for instance type systems, programming language
semantics, complexity theory related to programming languages,
compilation of functional programs.


Further details and application procedure: 
==========================================
