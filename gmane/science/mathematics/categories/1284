It turns out, as Fred Linton kindly let me know just after I posted
this, that Eilenberg developed such an account to general function
spaces in topology.  Yesterday I got a copy of Eilenberg's manuscript
(in the literal sense of manuscript) that Fred Linton sent me, which I
read with pleasure. Apparently this will be eventually published. It
was written around 1985. So, after all, there is (going to be) such a
development available in the literature.

The methods that both papers use are the same, and are due to Fox,
Arens, Dugundji, Day and Kelly, Scott, and Isbell (although we combine
them in different ways). These references and most of these methods
are discussed in a paper on function spaces published by Isbell in
1985.
