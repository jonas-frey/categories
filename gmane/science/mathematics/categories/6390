BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

EWSCS is a series of regional-scope international winter schools held
annually in Estonia. EWSCS are organized by Institute of Cybernetics,
a research institute of Tallinn University of Technology.

The main objective of EWSCS is to expose Estonian, Baltic, and Nordic
graduate students in computer science (but also interested students
from elsewhere) to frontline research topics usually not covered
within the regular curricula. The working language of the schools is
English.

EWSCS '11 is the sixteenth event of the series.


PROGRAMME

The schools' scientific programme consists of short courses by
renowned specialists and a student session.
