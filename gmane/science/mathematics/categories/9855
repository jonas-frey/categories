THIRD SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 3)
Call For Participation

University of Oxford
27-28 March, 2019
http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/syco/3/ =
<http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/syco/3/>=20

The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an
interdisciplinary series of meetings aiming to support the growing
community of researchers interested in the phenomenon of
compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives, and in
particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language.
The first SYCO was in September 2018 at the University of Birmingham.=20
The second SYCO was in December 2019, at the University of Strathclyde,=20=

each attracting about 70 people.=20

The third SYCO will be in Oxford and we have 15  accepted papers ranging =
over theory and practice of=20
category theory, from homotopy type theory to computational monads, to =
quantum resources, machine learning and  linguistics.=20

Indeed the SYCO series aims to bring together the communities behind =
many
previous successful events which have taken place over the last
decade, including "Categories, Logic and Physics", "Categories, Logic
and Physics (Scotland)", "Higher-Dimensional Rewriting and
Applications", "String Diagrams in Computation, Logic and Physics",
"Applied Category Theory", "Simons Workshop on Compositionality", and
the "Peripatetic Seminar in Sheaves and Logic".
