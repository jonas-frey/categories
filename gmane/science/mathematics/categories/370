SCOPE

The IC-EATCS (European Association of Theoretical Computer Science)
Advanced Schools focus on specific subjects of Theoretical Computer Science, 
and address an international public formed both by PhD students and by researchers 
who wish to deepen their knowledge of the field.
Besides the didactical purpose, these events aim at the dissemination of
advanced scientific knowledge and at the promotion of international contacts
and exchange of ideas among scientists. They intend to be an occasion,
especially for the youngest participants, to meet other people interested in
their research with whom to discuss ideas and to compare approaches and
results.

The IC-EATCS 1997 Advanced School will focus on "Models and Paradigms for
Concurrency". The aim is to provide a overview of some of the hot topics in
the field of Concurrency Theory, particularly concerning computational
models and linguistic paradigms.

If there are PhD students interested in taking an examination at 
the conclusion of the School, such an examination will be scheduled 
on Saturday 20 September, and will consist of exercises agreed upon by the
Organizers and the Lecturers.
