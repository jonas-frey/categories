Dear John,
This result is also proved in my paper below, published in 2001.

M. Grandis, Finite sets and symmetric simplicial sets, Theory Appl. =
Categ. 8 (2001), No. 8, 244-252.
Abstract. The category of finite cardinals (or equivalently, of finite =
sets) is the symmetric analogue of the category of finite ordinals, and =
the ground category of a relevant category of presheaves, the augmented =
symmetric simplicial sets. We prove here that this ground category has =
characterisations similar to the classical ones for the category of =
finite ordinals, by the existence of a universal symmetric monoid, or by =
generators and relations. The latter provides a definition of symmetric =
simplicial sets by faces, degeneracies and transpositions, under =
suitable relations.

Best wishes,  Marco
