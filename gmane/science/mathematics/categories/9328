  Dear all,

I am attaching an obituary that Barbara Mikolajewska (Linton) wrote. It cam=
e to me via Carol Wood, Fred's long-time colleague at Wesleyan.

Like those who have already expressed their thoughts, I will miss Fred. He =
was my unofficial thesis advisor, generous with ideas, guidance, encouragem=
ent, and friendship.

Joan


Fred E.J. Linton (1938-1917)

Fred Ernest Julius Linton passed away peacefully on Saturday, September 2, =
2017 at the Connecticut Hospice with his wife by his side. He was the belov=
ed husband of 26 years to Barbara Mikolajewska, whom he met in Poland. Fred=
  was born in Italy on April 8, 1938 and was the only son of Jewish parents =
who were escaping from Hitler's Germany to the United States of America. Be=
fore they got visas for the USA they spend few months in Ecuador. When they=
  came to the USA, they lived in New York City. Fred studied mathematics at =
Yale and got his Ph.D. from Columbia University. After graduation he accept=
ed a position at Wesleyan University as a professor of mathematics, where h=
e spent his entire career. He worked on category theory and was a highly-re=
spected mathematician who participated in numerous scientific conferences a=
nd discussions.

Fred enjoyed international folk dancing, which he did at Yale and at Columb=
ia.  After he came to Wesleyan, he helped start the folk-dance group `Ajde'=
  in New Haven, which studied and performed Eastern European folk dances and=
  music Many years later, the group began holding reunions at a country hous=
e in Vermont, where they rent the local town hall for more dancing.

Fred had a very active and curious mind, and after retirement he was still =
busy solving mathematical and computer science puzzles. Numbers never left =
his mind.  He loved classical music and traveling, which he did for vacatio=
ns as well as on several sabbaticals from Wesleyan.  He designed covers and=
  formats for self-published books that he produced together with his wife B=
arbara.  His interests extended to Indian literature and philosophy, and he=
  wrote and gave talks on the logic of Buddhism.  Together with Barbara, the=
ir website, The Lintons' Video Press, published twelve volumes of the Polis=
h translation of the Sanskrit epic poem, the Mahabharata.
