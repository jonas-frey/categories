Dear Ellis
=20

I also had this question when i started with category theory but
i was satisfied with the Yoneda lemma. Now thanks to your question
i know more theorems to answer this.

I don't think you can get a better answer than the replied suggestions.

However there is also higher category theory.
The interesting point would now be to generalize:
=20
What are the coresponding theorems for strict/weak n-categories?
=20
I plan to at least ask for and suggest a higher dimensional Yoneda lemma.
=20
The other adjoints preserving limits theorem is also interesting to
generalize. But here as far as i know there is no concept of adjoint
for 3-categories and higher up. I am more uncertain as to limits=2C
but i have not seen limits in n-categories defined in the
graceful style of limits in 1-categories.
