Well, maybe. I resisted this for quite a while, because I don't
really want people to buy `Topos Theory' (I'd much rather they
bought copies of the Elephant), but in the end I had to concede
that Dover knew their business better than I did, and if they said
there was a market for it they were probably right.

Incidentally, the reaction of one Cambridge colleague on learning
that I'd appeared as a Dover reprint was `I didn't know you were dead'.
