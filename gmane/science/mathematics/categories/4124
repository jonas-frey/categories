			      FMCS 2008
      16th Workshop on Foundational Methods in Computer Science
		Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada
			May 30 - June 1, 2008

			  FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

				* * *

 Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop
 bringing together researchers in mathematics and computer science with
 a focus on the application of category theory in computer science.

 This year's meeting will be hosted in the Department of Mathematics
 and Statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.

 There will be an informal welcome reception in the evening of May 29.
 The scientific program starts on May 30, and consists of a day of
 tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to category theory, as well
 as a day and a half of research talks. The meeting ends at mid-day on
 June 1.

 FMCS 2008 takes place one week after MFPS 2008 (which will be held at
 the University of Pennsylvania). We hope that this will enable and
 encourage participants from overseas to attend both conferences!

Research talks

 There will be some invited presentations, but the majority of the
 talks are solicited from the participants. If you wish to give a talk
 please send a title and abstract to fmcs2008@mathstat.dal.ca. Time
 slots are limited, so please register early if you would like to be
 considered for a talk.

Student support

 Graduate student participation is particularly encouraged at
 FMCS. Students will pay a reduced registration fee. We will also be
 able to provide limited financial support; if you are interested in
 this, please email us at fmcs2008@mathstat.dal.ca.

Special session

 There will be a special session in honor of Ernie Manes' 65th
 birthday. The special session organizer is Phil Mulry.

Accommodations

 We have reserved a block of rooms at the King's College residences.
 The rate, including taxes, are $37.37 per night for a single room,
 and $56.04 for a double room. Reservations can be made by sending an
 e-mail to conferences@admin.ukings.ns.ca and mentioning "FMCS 2008".
 Please make your reservations early to ensure availability.

Registration

 Please register for the meeting by emailing fmcs2008@mathstat.dal.ca.
 There will be a reasonable on-site registration fee to cover meeting
 costs.
