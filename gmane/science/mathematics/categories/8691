Hi -

While we're at it, here is my own review of Cheng's book, which should
eventually appear in the notices of the London Mathematical Society.

Eugenia Cheng has written a delightfully clear and down-to-earth
> explanation of the spirit of mathematics, and in particular category
> theory, based on their similarities to cooking.  Sometimes people complain
> about a math textbook that it's "just a cookbook", offering recipes but no
> insight.  Cheng shows the flip side of this analogy, providing plenty of
> insight into mathematics by exploring its resemblance to the culinary
> arts.  Her book has recipes, but it's no mere cookbook.
>
> Among all forms of cooking, it seems Cheng's favorite is the baking of
> desserts---and among all forms of mathematics, category theory.   This is
> no coincidence: like category theory, the art of the pastry chef is one of
> the most exacting, but also one of the most delightful, thanks to the
> elegance of its results.  Cheng gives an example: "Making puff pastry is a
> long and precise process, involving repeated steps of chilling, rolling and
> foldking to create the deliciously delicate and buttery layers that makes
> puff pastry different from other kinds of pastry."

I'm not sure "exacting" is the right word to describe category theory, but
there's probably *something* difficult about it that it shares with making
pastries.   Obviously I couldn't say "abstract".
