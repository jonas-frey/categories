First Announcement  				April 22, 1998


		SMOOTH CATEGORIES IN GEOMETRY AND MECHANICS

           Special session of AMS Meeting No. 943 in Buffalo, N.Y.

			  April 24/25, 1999 

	The intended subject of the session includes 
(a)  the application of extensive categories, regular categories,

geometry, functional analysis of smooth functions and differential 
forms, distributions and currents, the motion and heating of extended
bodies, electro-magnetism,...

as well as
 
(b)  the formulation and explanation of problems in those fields to which
such application would possibly be useful.

	To facilitate the organizing process, please send
