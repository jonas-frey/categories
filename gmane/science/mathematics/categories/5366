Dear Alexandru,

I would recommend the paper "Partial Horn logic and cartesian
categories" that I wrote with Eric Palmgren (Annals of Pure and Applied
Logic 145 (3) (2007), pp. 314 - 353; doi:10.1016/j.apal.2006.10.001).

Free categories of various kinds usually do exist, an idea that comes
out well in Higgins's 1971 "Notes on categories and groupoids" (now
reissued as a TAC reprint).

The underlying machinery, again recognized for a long time, relies on
the notion of left exact theories, alias finite limit theories,
cartesian theories or essentially algebraic theories. In the formulation
as an essentially algebraic theory, the operators may be partial but
their domains of definition can be expressed in terms of equations using
operators defined "earlier" (i.e. there is an ordering on the
operators). For categories, the core example is composition, which is
partial and defined when an equation holds between the domain of one
morphism and the codomain of the other. But the same phenomenon arises,
for example, when adding morphisms in an Abelian enriched category or
composing 2-cells in a 2-category.

The fundamental result for left exact theories is that a forgetful
functor, from a category of algebras for one theory to that for another
with fewer operators (or fewer equations, for that matter), has a left
adjoint.

I believe the result is covered in chapter 4 Barr and Wells' "Toposes,
Triples and Theories", or at least is inferrable from Kennison's Theorem
 as stated there.

Palmgren and I proved the fundamental freeness result (our Theorem 29,
Free Partial Model Theorem) in a way that makes much clearer the
connection with the well known result for algebraic theories. (For
algebraic theories, with all operators total, you just take a term model
and factor out a congruence.) We used a logic, minimally adapted from
the standard account of categorical logic as in the Elephant, in which
terms are only partially defined. We also described a simple
"quasi-equational" mode of theory presentation equivalent to left exact
theories. The proof is then very similar to the algebraic case, taking a
partial term model and factoring out a partial congruence. It is also
more elementary than that in TTT.

I hope this will answer your question in most cases.

Strictness is an issue, as you mention. Our treatment is very syntactic
in nature, and expects strictness of homomorphisms. However, we do have
techniques that allow this to be relaxed - see our Theorem 56.

We also give various examples from category theory, as well as
discussing some of the history of the result.

Regards,

Steve Vickers.
