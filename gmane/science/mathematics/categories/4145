MSc Opportunities in Verification, Knowledge Representation, and Logic
Programming

         =20

Applications are invited from students interested in pursuing an MSc in
Computer Science at St. Francis Xavier University.  Students will be
pursuing thesis research in an area related to one of the following:
verification, logic programming, automated theorem proving, temporal,
modal, paraconsistent and other nonclassical logics, knowledge
representation, ontology building and merging, scheduling, and
requirements and software engineering. The students will join a growing
research group at the StFX Centre for Logic and Information, in
Antigonish, NS, that is collaborating on a prestigious international
research and development project with a health informatics company and a
regional Health Authority.  The project goal is verifiable and
innovative workflow and decision support products for complex and
distributed systems.  Opportunities exist within the project to work on
applications in parallel and high performance computing using ACENet,
Atlantic Canada's high performance computing consortium ( www.ace-net.ca
<http://www.ace-net.ca/>  ).

Project Lead:  Dr.Wendy MacCaull, Professor of Mathematics, Statistics
and Computer Science and Director of the StFX Centre for Logic and
Information. ( http://logic.stfx.ca <http://logic.stfx.ca/> )

Qualifications: A BSc. Honours degree in Computer Science (or closely
related subject).

Funding: Students without external funding will be awarded funding for 2
years at the rate of $16,000 per year. Once accepted, students are
encouraged to apply for graduate student assistantships which typically
cover the cost of tuition; duties average 4 to 6 hours per week.
Students with external funding will receive a suitable supplement.
Canadian citizens and permanent residents of Canada will have the
opportunity of applying for an NSERC Industrial Postgraduate Scholarship
(IPS) and working on site with the health informatics company for 20% of
each year.

To Apply: Interested students should forward a university transcript and
a covering letter which outlines their interests and their experience,
especially with respect to the thesis research areas, and  includes the
names and addresses of 3 references to Dr. W. MacCaull
(wmaccaul@stfx.ca).  Simultaneously they should submit their application
for graduate studies to StFX, see:
http://www.stfx.ca/academic/mathcs/MASTERS/index.html . Applicants will
be reviewed, initially, on Feb. 15, 2008, but the file will remain open
until filled. =20
