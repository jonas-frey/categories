Dear David,

Yes, this is true for regular epis in any cartesian closed category.
I don't know a published proof, but here is the argument:

if h: A x C --> E factors through 1_A x g, then its transpose
C --> E^A factors through g, and so coequalizes any pair R ==> C
of which g is a coequalizer.
But if h also factors through f x 1_C, then its transpose factors
through E^B --> E^A, which is monic (since E^(-), being self-adjoint
on the right, sends epis to monos), so the induced C --> E^B also
coequalizes R ==> C and hence factors through g.
Hence h factors through f x g.

In fact, as is clear from the above argument, we need only one of
f and g to be regular epic.

Best regards,
Peter Johnstone
