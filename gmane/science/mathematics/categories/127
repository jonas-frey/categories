The answer to the general question is surely "no": the sentences
which hold in Sh(X + X) are exactly those which hold in Sh(X).
Whether one can separate Sh(R) from Sh([0,\infty)) in this way
is a more interesting question. Does "Brouwer's continuity theorem"
hold in Sh([0,\infty))? The proof that I know for Sh(R) doesn't
work over [0,\infty), but that may be because it's not the best
proof.
