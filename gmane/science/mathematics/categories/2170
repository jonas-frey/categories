Unless my definition of Heyting algebra is a bit off, I am sure that this (and
hence 3) is false.  I assume that in a Heyting algebra T does not equal F.
This follows the intuitive introduction of Heyting algebras by
Moerdijk/MacLane as capturing the algebraic structure of topologies.

If that is not the case then disregard the rest of my message.

Anyway, under these assumptions, the trivial HA {T,F} is both initial and
final.  Hence 0 = 1 (= means is iso to).  Any CCC with 0 = 1 is trivial.  I
will leave the diagram chase to you but it can be summarized as follows.

Let A be any HA.  Then

	A = A^1 = A^0 = 1.

Hope this helps,
