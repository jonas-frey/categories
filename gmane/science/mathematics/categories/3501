KURT G=D6DEL CENTENARY RESEARCH PRIZE FELLOWSHIPS

(Organized by the Kurt G=F6del Society with support from the John Templeton=
 Foundation)

The Kurt G=F6del Society is proud to announce the commencement of the resea=
rch fellowship prize program in honor
and celebration of Kurt G=F6del's 100th birthday.

The research fellowship prize program sponsored by the John Templeton Found=
ation will offer:
two Ph.D. (pre-doctoral) fellowships of $60,000 US per annum for two years
two post-doctoral fellowships of $ 80,000 US per annum for two years
one senior fellowship of $120,000 US per annum for one year


The purpose of the fellowship is to support original research in mathematic=
al logic, =93meta-mathematics,=94
philosophy of mathematical logic, and the foundations of mathematics. This =
fellowship is to carry forward the legacy of G=F6del,
whose works exemplify deep insights and breakthrough discoveries in mathema=
tical logic.

The selection will be made based upon an open, international competition.
An international Board of Jurors chaired by Professor Harvey Friedman will =
oversee the process.
The finalist papers will be published in a special issue of a premier journ=
al in mathematical logic.

Goal and Criteria of Merit:


In pursuit of similar insights
and discoveries, we adopt the following criteria of merit for evaluating Fe=
llowship applications:

1. Intellectual merit, scientific rigor and originality of the submitted pa=
per and work plan.
The paper should combine visionary thinking with academic excellence.

2. Potential for significant contribution to basic foundational understandi=
ng of logic and the likelihood for opening
new, fruitful lines of inquiry.

3. Impact of the grant on the project and likelihood that the grant will ma=
ke this new line of research possible.

4. The probability that the pursuit of this line of research is realistic a=
nd feasible for the applicant.

5. Qualifications of the applicants evaluated via CV and recommendation let=
ters*
(*recommendation letters are not required for senior applications).




Scopes:

Original fellowship proposals from all fields of mathematical logic
(such as Computability Theory, Model Theory, Proof Theory, Set Theory),
meta-mathematics,
the philosophy of mathematics, and the foundations of mathematics insofar a=
s the research
has strong relevance or resemblance to the G=F6delian insights and original=
ity.
