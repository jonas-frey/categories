Dear Peter,

Fowler (I have the 1965 edition) says, "there being no other word 'role'
from which it has to be kept distinct, both the italics and the accent
might well be abandoned."

He also refers (under an article on 'morale') to the "sanctity of the
French form". The word comes from French, and French gives it the
accent, and some like to display their knowledge of this fact. But
Fowler's argument is that English is not obliged to keep the French form.

Returning to category theory, and topos theory in particular, I can't
resist also quoting his guidance on Latin plurals (which surely must
apply even more to Greek): "All that can be safely said [regarding
whether to prefer or avoid the Latin form] is that there is a tendency
to abandon the Latin plurals, and that, when one is really in doubt
which to use, the English form should be given the preference."

Regards,

Steve.
