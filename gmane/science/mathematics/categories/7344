There was some discussion of this a couple of years ago on Andrej
Bauer=E2=80=99s blog and mathoverflow:

http://math.andrej.com/2010/11/10/subgroups-are-equalizers-constructively/
http://mathoverflow.net/questions/41208/are-all-group-monomorphisms-regular=
-constructively/

(the chronology/causality between the two is a little non-obvious: the
MO question predates the blog post, but the eventual solution at MO
follows it)

The discussion there is on proving this constructively, but as often,
the first step is looking at the classical proof with a magnifying
glass.
