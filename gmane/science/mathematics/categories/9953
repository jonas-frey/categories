PPS. I see now that the 1958 paper of Rosen is indeed listed as a reference in Kurosh et al. 1960 "Foundations of the
theory of categories" (and, of course, Rosen too uses "the theory of categories" in the title). Curiously, however, it
seems there is no quotation of Rosen in the body of the paper and it's not clear to me that it was Rosen who convinced
them this is a separate research area. Throughout, they refer to "the theory of categories" as an already established
field, impossible to summarize in one article.

Furthermore, the introduction ends with one an expression of?? "gratitude to the participants in the seminar on the
theory of categories, which worked under the direction of one of the authors in Moscow University". Its participants
apparently produced quite a few papers listed by MacLane. Not sure when it started, but I doubt if there is any example
of an earlier seminar devoted to (foundations of) category theory. As I said earlier and as mentioned by MacLane, in
1960 Kurosh also lectured about the subject in Prague.
