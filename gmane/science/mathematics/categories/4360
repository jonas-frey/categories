The 24th Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics Conference
will take place on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania from
Thursday, May 22 through midday Sunday, May 25, 2008. The program
includes plenary lectures by Samson Abramsky (Oxford), Luca Cardelli
(Microsoft Research, Cambridge), Dusko Pavlovic (Kestrel and Oxford),
Benjamin Pierce (Penn), Phil Scott (Ottawa) and James Worrell
(Oxford). In addition to special sessions on Systems Biology, on
Security and on Type Theory, there will be a session honoring Phil
Scott on his 60th birthday year. The remainder of the program will
consist of the papers accepted from those submitted for presentation
at the meeting; the list of accepted papers is now available on the
conference web site.

In addition to MFPS 24, a Tutorial Day on Category Theory and Computer
Science will take place on Wednesday, May 21. This has been organized
by Phil Scott, and will have lectures by Marcelo Fiore (Cambridge),
Nicola Gambino (Leicester), Pieter Hofstra (Ottawa) and Peter Selinger
(Dalhousie).

Detailed information about all these activities is available at the
conference web site,
http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps24.htm  Registration information
is also available on the web site; the deadline for reservations at
the conference hotel is April 20, so we recommend those interested in
attending the meeting register within the next week or so.
   Best regards,
