Dear Ross,

I agree with you on all points:=20
Pseudo-fibrations is much better than weak fibrations, it describes more =
precisely the notion defined. I hope it will be adopted by the =
category-commmunity.
I am also convinced that these pseudo fibrations have a mathematical =
role.

The example I gave has two interests:
(i) To show that calling them fibrations would violate all our =
intuitions about the idea of fibration.=20
(ii) to provide a new, important,  and perhaps not known example of such =
pseudo fibrations.

Of course what makes things work in that example is that, if G is a =
groupoid, for cospans with codomain G comma objects and pseudo pullbacks =
coincide.
This is also true in any 2-Category C, if you define a groupoid of C to =
be an object G such that for each object X of C, the category  C(X,G) is =
a groupoid.

Best wishes,

Jean
