And thanks for your more perspicuous reply!  Your argument apparently
applies to both coproduct and tensor of strong monads, and also to a
free strong monad on a strong endofunctor.  Each of these can be
characterized both by a universal property and by a left adjoint to a
forgetful functor from an algebra category.  Nice.

The universal property is alluded to in the TCS paper "Combining
effects: sum and tensor" by Hyland, Plotkin and Power: page 4,
paragraph beginning "There is also relevant unpublished work by Paul
Levy".  I gave up on it (i.e. the universal property) thinking it was
too weak.  Now you've shown me it wasn't.
