In `higher homotopy theory', terminology has not setled down nor is it
transparent

homotopy ___________ algebra can mean a variety of things

letting ______________ = associative
it can mean JUST that there is a homtopy for associaitivity
or
some authors use it to mean A_\infty

which I initially tried to indicate by strongly homtopy associative

_\infty seems to have caught on to mean the presence of higher homtopies
of all orders

in most but not all cases, such algebras have a homtopy invariant
defintion

so I would suggest the following revisionist terminology

1-homotopy associative means JUST that there is a homotopy for
associaitivity

similarly n-homotopy associative would mean homotopies of homotopies
of...

homotopy invariant ___ algebra would mean just what it says

so far so good
but now what about e.g. 1-homotopy associaitve satisfying a STRICT
pentagon??

perhaps strict 1-homotopy

open to suggestions
