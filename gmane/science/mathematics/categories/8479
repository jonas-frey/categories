I think there are lots of answers to Mike's question. Just to give one,
I gave a talk in 2003 published with Tim Porter as

   `Category theory and higher dimensional algebra: potential descriptive
tools in neuroscience', Proceedings of the International Conference on
Theoretical Neurobiology, Delhi, February 2003, edited by Nandini Singh,
National Brain Research
Centre, Conference Proceedings 1 (2003) 80-92. arXiv:math/0306223

which went well. A web search on "category theory and biology" shows
lots more.

Category theory has (at least) two aspects.  One as a kind of meta
theory for discussing and relating mathematical structures; another as
giving a range of algebraic,  or more generally,  mathematical,
structures, often with algebraic operations with partial domains. We can
expect these to have over time surprising applications
