Thanks Peter. It did occur to me last night that this probably was the
hyperconnected-localic factorisation and it is nice to have this
feeling confirmed! The problem is that the factorisation system I
described allows one to adjoin n-ary relations to _arbitrary_ objects
of Set[O], rather than merely to the generic object. In particular, as
you point out, of the first group of maps I listed it is only
necessary to consider the case n=1, and in fact on looking at at your
proof, orthogonality to this immediately implies orthogonality to the
last of the maps I listed.

Here's an attempt to overcome this; I suspect it will end up suffering
the same fate as the previous one but you never know! Rather than
describing a factorisation system on GTop, I am going to describe one
on GTop / Set[O]. The generating right maps will simply be the maps
from the classifying topos of an object equipped with an n-ary
relation into Set[O], though now these maps are viewed as maps over
Set[O]. If this generates a factorisation system (E, M), then its
M-maps with codomain E --> Set[O] will correspond to those things
constructible by repeatedly adjoining n-ary relations or equations
between n-ary relations to the specified object of E. Every such map
will be localic, but I think that the E-maps are no longer the
hyperconnected morphisms; the inverse image part of such a map need
only be full on subobjects of the specified object of its domain.

Now on factorising the unique map from R: Set --> Set[O] into the
terminal object of GTop / Set[O], it is possible that we obtain
something non-trivial which captures the structures (in geometric
logic) supported by the reals. I am however a bit hesitant about this
as my feeling is that if p: E --> F is an E-map of toposes over
Set[O], and F --> Set[O] is localic, then p probably is actually
hyperconnected (i.e., fullness on subobjects of the (image of) the
generic object implies fullness on all subobjects) so that we are back
in the situation we were in before...
