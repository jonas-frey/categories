Hi,

then , in this setting, how coherence should be interpreted?
According to Mac Lane, a coherence theorem asserts commutativity
of a class of diagrams; some other authors mean rather decision
procedure/criteria  for commutativity of diagrams.

By the way, did you consider some kind of "basic" arrows
and generated "canonical maps"? Do there appear/be used
some known types of categories with structure
(cartesian, monoidal, cartesian closed, monoidal closed)?

Another interesting question could be isomorphism of objects.

Best wishes
