The 10th Asian Logic Conference will be held at Kobe University, Kobe, Japan
during September 1-6, 2008.

Several short course lectures (four hours each), plenary invited talks (one
hour each) and special sessions are planned apart from contributed talks.

The Asian Logic Conference has occurred every three years in Asia-Pacific
region since 1981, Singapore. The purpose of the conference is to facilitate
interaction between researchers interested in mathematical logic, logic in
computer science, and philosophical logic. It aims at promoting activities in
mathematical logic in the Asia-Pacific so that logicians both from within Asia
and elsewhere would get together and exchange information and ideas.

Call for papers will begin in the coming winter, and the registration in an
early spring, 2008.

Please write down in your notebook as 'ALC, Kobe, Sep. 1-6, 2008'.

Thank you,
