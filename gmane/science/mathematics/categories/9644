An affine space over any given field differs *k* from a vector space over
*k* only in its algebraic structure, not its topological structure.
Whereas the algebraic operations of a vector space over *k* consist of all
finitary linear combinations with coefficients drawn from *k*, those of an
affine space consist of the subset of those combinations whose coefficients
sum to unity, the barycentric combinations.  Since the former includes the
constant 0 as a linear combination while the latter does not, a consequence
is that 0 is a fixpoint of linear transformations but not of affine
transformations, whence the latter can include the translations.

This is equally true whether *k* is the rationals or the reals.   So
whatever method you use to obtain the real line from the rational line
should also produce the affine real line from the affine rational line.

The relevance of the equational theory I gave in my previous message is
that it is equivalent to the equational theory of affine spaces over the
rationals yet does not require a separate theory of the rationals.  The
insight here is that the polynomials formed from the operations 2b - a and
all finitary centroid operations, one for each positive finite arity, are
precisely the barycentric linear combinations with rational coefficients.
The real line is a model of this theory but lacks the usual topology that
expands its algebraic operations to include linear combinations with all
real coefficients.  I cannot conceive how the absence of the linear
combinations whose coefficients don't sum to unity could be an obstacle for
you.
