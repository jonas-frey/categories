Hello,

   I have been reading up on the Curry-Howard
isomorphism. In the last chapter of "Conceptual
Mathematics" Lawvevre and Schanuel say that the
logical connectives are completely analogous to
categorical operations x, map object and +. Is this an
oblique reference to the Curry-Howard isomorphism?

Regards, Bill Halchin
