There will be a conference in Paris to celebrate the 80th birhday of =
Alexander Grothendieck

http://www.ihes.fr/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?document_id=3D1661&portlet_id=3D14=


and the publication of Pursuing Stacks and the associated correspondence =
will be announced. There is from my point of view one lacuna which I =
would like to fill. My memory is that I read in 1982 in a SLNM paper on =
category theory, I think by Jack Duskin, in which he referred to =
Grothendieck's interest in n-categories. This suggested to me to write =
to Grothendieck with lots of papers and asking for a meeting, since I =
was going to Marseilles-Luminy  that summer. I have been unable to =
identify this paper. Help would be appreciated!
