Dear Bill,

You ask:

In the applications of algebraic topology to topology, where do the=20
=91basepoints=92 originate?

I'd like to give a different type of answer to that suggested in your=20
list. (yet another is : whoopee, we have a group!)

After I first thought of the van Kampen theorem for the whole=20
fundamental groupoid I realised one wanted *computation*, and the whole=20
fundamental groupoid of a space was too big for that. The fundamental=20
group at a base point was too small in may cases, such as the circle.=20
The solution that seemed right to me, and which took a while to find,=20
was the fundamental groupoid on a set of base points chosen conveniently=20
according to the geometry of a given situation. Eldon Dyer said I ought=20
to take a hard line on this: if the connected space X is the union of=20
127 open sets whose intersections have 3,272 components, you do not want=20
to take a single base point! Such situations (even with infinitely many=20
components) occur in group theory applications, and analogously in=20
topology in connected covering spaces over a union of 2 open sets.

I advocated the fundamental groupoid on a set of base points in my 1968=20
book `Elements of Modern Topology', but this concept has I think not=20
been mentioned in any later date algebraic topology text in English by=20
other authors. Also group theorists are happy with graphs and free=20
groups, but are very wary of the free groupoid on a graph! The only new=20
result from that book that has been taken up is the gluing theorem for=20
homotopy equivalences, but its origin is usually unacknowledged.

Looking at the way this groupoid van Kampen theorem could be used, it=20
seemed amazing to me that one could obtain *complete* information on a=20
fundamental group by deducing that from knowledge of a larger structure,=20
for which one had colimit information, whereas my tries with nonabelian=20
cohomology gave only exact sequences. It seems that groupoids have the=20
advantages of structure in dimensions 0 and 1, and that this is needed=20
for what Grothendieck later called `integration of homotopy types'.

Could one find analogous objects with structure in dimensions 0, 1,=20
...,n? This question led (after many years, and with fortunate=20
collaborations) to higher dimensional van Kampen theorems, which gave=20
quite new information on homotopy invariants, some of them nonabelian,=20
e.g. second relative homotopy groups, triad homotopy groups, n-adic=20
Hurewicz Theorems. Such results were published in 1978, 1981 (with=20
Higgins), 1987 (with Loday). These theorems are, I think, not even=20
mentioned in any texts on algebraic topology (except mine). Some current=20
writers (Faria Martins, Kauffman, Ellis, Mikhailov,...) are using these=20
techniques.

So for me the question is: why are people unwilling to throw off the=20
shackles of a single base point? I would welcome enlightenment. It may=20
be that it is found just too hard to fit this idea into what is=20
currently considered the `real world', and so to obtain new results. For=20
example, what happens to iterated loop space theory, with more than one=20
base point?

Those interested in the sociology of science might like an excerpt from=20
a lecture by Alan MacKay on icosahedral symmetry at the LMS in 1985. He=20
said the reaction went through three phases:

Phase 1) It is false.

Phase 2) It is true, but unimportant.

Phase 3) It is true, it is very important; and we have known it for years=
!

All the best

Ronnie
