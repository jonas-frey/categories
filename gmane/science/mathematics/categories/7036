David,

My guess would be to start with the tricategory of spans of categories:

The objects are categories, and a 1-morphism from C to D is category E with=
  two functors, F:E \to C and G:E \to D, and composition is given by computi=
ng 2-categorical pullbacks of categories (so is associative only up to equi=
valence), 2-morphisms between a span (F,G):E \to C \times D and a span (F',=
G'):E' \to C \times D are given by a functor H:E \to E' together with natur=
al isomorphisms making everything commute, and 3-morphisms between two such=
  2-morphisms H,H':E \to E' (I'm suppressing the natural isomorphisms in my =
notation, but they're still there) are natural transformations compatible w=
ith the natural isomorphisms associated to H and H'.

Now a partial functor from C to D is a particular case of a span, F:E \to C=
  and G:E \to D, but where F is required to be full and faithful. Since Span=
(Cat) is a tricategory, Hom_Span(Cat)(C,D) is a bicategory. Take the full s=
ub-bicategory of Hom_Span(Cat)(C,D) on those spans (F,G) where F is full an=
d faithful. This is a bicategory of partial functors.

Hi,

A partial functor from C to D is given by a subcategory S of C and a
functor from S to D. What is the appropriate notion of natural
transformation between partial functors that would allow to turn small
categories, partial functors and those "natural transformations" into
a bicategory? The difficulty is that two partial functors from C to D
might not have the same definition domain.
