Description:
This event has as its goal to bring together researchers working on 
mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing and 
spatio-temporal causal structures, and in particular those that use 
logical tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal 
languages, semantical methods and other computer science methods for the 
study physical behaviour in general. Over the past couple of years there 
has been a growing activity in these foundational approaches together with 
a renewed interest in the foundations of quantum theory, which complement 
the more mainstream research in quantum computation. A predecessor of this 
event, with the same acronym, called Quantum Programming Languages, was 
held in Ottawa (2003), Turku (2004), Chicago (2005) and Oxford (2006). The 
first QPL under the new name Quantum Physics and Logic was held in 
Reykjavik (2008) and the second in Oxford (2009); with the change of name 
and a new program committee we emphasise the intended much broader scope 
of this event, aiming to nourish interaction between modern computer 
science logic, quantum computation and information, models of 
spatio-temporal causality, and quantum foundations.

Submission:
Prospective speakers are invited to submit a 2-5 pages abstract which 
provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest and provides 
sufficient detail to allows the program committee to assess the merits of 
the work. Submissions of works in progress are encouraged but must be more 
substantial than a research proposal. We both encourage submissions of 
original research as well as research submitted elsewhere. Submissions 
should be in Postscript or PDF format and should be sent to Bob Coecke by 
March 28, with as subject line QPL Submission. Receipt of all submissions 
will be acknowledged by return email. Extended versions of accepted 
original research contributions will be published as a special issue of a 
jounal - we are currently still exploring the options.
