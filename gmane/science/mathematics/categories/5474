Dear Colleagues,
=20
This is the Second Call for Papers for MFPS 26, which will take place on =
the campus of the University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada  from May 6 - =
10, 2010. We encourage submissions in all areas relating to the topics =
of the meeting. A brief synopsis of the meeting is given below; more =
information can be found at the conference web site =
http:.//www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps26=20
=20
Submissions for the conference are now open; they can be submitted =
through EasyChair - you can access the site via the URL =
https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=3Dmfps2010

Note that it is preferred that submissions be prepared using the ENTCS =
macro package for MFPS - the necessary files and instructions can be =
found at http://www.entcs.org

 Best regards,
 Mike MIslove

		   Twenty-sixth Conference on the
		     Mathematical Foundations of
			Programming Semantics

		           University of Ottawa
		       Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
                             May 6 - 10, 2010

The Twenty-sixth Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of =
Programming Semantics will take place on the campus of the University of =
Ottawa, Ontario, Canada UK from May 6 - 10, 2010. MFPS conferences are =
devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic, and computer science that =
are related to models of computation, in general, and to the semantics =
of programming languages, in particular. The series has particularly =
stressed providing a forum where researchers in mathematics and computer =
science can meet and exchange ideas about problems of common interest. =
As the series also strives to maintain breadth in its scope, the =
conference strongly encourages participation by researchers in =
neighboring areas.

TOPICS include, but are not limited to, the following: biocomputation; =
concurrent and distributed computation; constructive mathematics; domain =
theory and categorical models; formal languages; formal methods; game =
semantics; lambda calculus; logic; probabilistic systems; process =
calculi; programming language theory; quantum computation; security; =
topological models; type systems; type theory.

The INVITED SPEAKERS for MFPS XXVI are

Amal Ahmed, Indiana
Martin Escardo, Birmingham
Cedric Fournet, Microsoft, Paris
Pieter Hofstra, Ottawa
Jean Krivine, PPS, Paris 7
Keye Martin, NRL

The program also includes four special sessions and a tutorial lecture =
each day of the meeting.=20
The Program Committee chair is Peter Selinger (Dalhousie).=20

IMPORTANT DATES:

- February 5, 2010		Title and Short Abstract submission =
deadline

- February 12, 2010		Paper submission deadline

- March 15, 2010        		Notification to authors

- April 2, 2010			Preliminary proceedings version due

There will be a preliminary proceedings of the conference papers that =
will be distributed at the meeting, with a final proceedings published =
in ENTCS after the meeting. Submissions to the meeting should be =
prepared using ENTCS Macros, which are available from the ENTCS Macro =
Web Pages http://www.entcs.org Submissions should be in the form of a =
pdf file not to exceed 15 pages in length.=20

MFPS is organized by Stephen Brookes (CMU), Achim Jung (Birmingham), =
Catherine Meadows (NRL), Michael Mislove (Tulane) and Prakash Panangaden =
(McGill). The local organizers for MFPS 26 are Rick Blute and Phil Scott =
(Ottawa).=20
