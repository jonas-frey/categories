In the film "A Beautiful Mind," the first indication that John Nash is
regaining his abilities is a conversation with a student ("Galois
extensions are really the same as covering spaces!" exclaims Toby, the
student). The scene ends with Nash and the student bent over some
papers and -- as I heard it -- the student says:

    "Functor...Two...Categories"

(The film's not bad but its relation to Nash's life is tangential. If I
had not absorbed a hint from a review, I think I might have stomped
out in the middle because of the ridiculous portrayal of what
mathematicians do. It turns out that the filmmakers are playing a game
-- very effective with most of the audience -- in sliding between
perceptions: ours and Nash's.)
