Dear Category Theorists,
In summer 2019, after a career in Mathematics and Computer Science spanning=
  more than thirty years, our friend and colleague John Power will retire an=
d return to Australia. John has advanced our understanding of many topics i=
n his career, including coherence problems, algebraic theories, algebraic e=
ffects in computation, and logic programming. He has been instrumental in i=
ntroducing and promulgating the effective use of categorical methods in com=
puter science. As important as John=92s academic qualities, he has also bee=
n a wonderful colleague. John has been an amazing mentor, supporter and fri=
end to many of us and in particular to younger academics. We have all been =
touched by his kindness and his humour.
To celebrate all of John=92s achievements, and to inspire further work, we =
will hold a small informal workshop at the University of Bath where John ha=
s worked for the last decade, with confirmed attendance from several of his=
  collaborators, including Martin Hyland, Ekaterina Komendantskaya, Paul Lev=
y, Edmund Robinson and Pino Rosolini. We are looking for further talks and =
John has indicated he would particularly like to encourage younger members =
of the academic community to volunteer talks. Attendance is free. There is =
no formal registration process, but we do plan to supply tea and coffee, so=
  to help us gauge numbers please follow the instructions below. Please, als=
o forward to others who might be interested.
Date: Thursday 27 June
Location: University of Bath, England
Action: Please send an email to Guy McCusker (g.a.mccusker@bath.ac.uk<mailt=
o:g.a.mccusker@bath.ac.uk>) if you plan to attend and indicate if you would=
  like to give a talk
Details: We will update the web page http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~gam23/JohnPo=
werWorkshop/

All the best
Guy McCusker and Neil Ghani
