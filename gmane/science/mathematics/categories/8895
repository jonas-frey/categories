                    Using the top 3/4 of the the first page of the
                        New York Times's weekly Science Section:

                        EUGENIA CHENG MAKES MATH A PIECE OF CAKE
          It can also be a piece of pie, or custard ??? so says a professor
and
            author who spreads the magic of numbers through dessert
recipes.

                                   by Natalie Angier
                                      May 2, 2016

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/science/eugenia-cheng-math-how-to-bake-pi.html?_r=0


         She is a theoretical mathematician who works in a rarefied field
called
         category theory, which is so abstract that ???even some pure
mathematicians
         think it goes too far,??? Dr. Cheng said.

         At the same time, Dr. Cheng is winning fame as a math
popularizer,
         convinced that the pleasures of math can be conveyed to the
legions of
         numbers-averse humanities majors still recovering from high
school
         algebra. She has been featured on shows like ???Late Night With
Stephen
         Colbert,??? and her online math tutorials have been viewed more
than a
         million times.

         The hardcover edition of her first book, ???How to Bake ??: An
Edible
         Exploration of the Mathematics of Mathematics,??? has sold about
25,000
         copies in this country and been translated into six languages, a
         surprising hit for a text visibly if judiciously seasoned with
numbers,
         graphs and equations. The book is being released in paperback
this month.
