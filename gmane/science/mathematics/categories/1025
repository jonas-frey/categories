extended abstracts to A.P Ershov Third International Conference
"Perspectives in System Informatics" (PSI'99) is extended for 
two weeks as follows:

NEW DEADLINE: February 14, 1999

                        FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS
            Andrei Ershov Third International Conference
                  PERSPECTIVES OF SYSTEM INFORMATICS

        6 - 9 July 1999, Novosibirsk, Akademgorodok, Russia

AIMS AND SCOPE

The conference is held to honour the late Academician Andrei Ershov
(1931-1988) and his outstanding contributions towards advancing
informatics. The first two conferences were held in May 1991 and
June 1996 and proved to be big international events.

Andrei Ershov was one of the early Russian pioneers in the field of
theoretical and systems programming, a founder of the Siberian School

of Computer Science. In 1974 he was nominated as a Distinguished
Fellow of the British Computer Society. In 1981 he received the
Silver Core Award for services rendered to IFIP. Andrei Ershov's
brilliant speeches were always in the focus of public attention.
Especially notable was his lecture on "Aesthetic and human factor in
programming" presented at the AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference
in 1972. Andrei Ershov was not only an extremely gifted scientist,
teacher and fighter for his ideas, but also a bright and many-sided
personality. He wrote poetry, translated the works of R.Kipling and
other English poets, and enjoyed playing guitar and singing.
Everyone who had the pleasure of knowing Andrei Ershov and working
with him will always remember his great vision, eminent
achievements, and generous friendship.

The aim of the Conference is to provide a forum for the presentation
and in-depth discussion of advanced research directions in Computer
Science. For a developing science, it is important to work out
consolidating ideas, concepts and models. Movement in this direction
is one of the goals the Conference is to meet. Improvement of the
contacts and exchange of ideas between researchers from the East and
West are further goals.

CONFERENCE TOPICS

Conference topics include:

              Semantics-Based Program Processing
- program specification, transformation, and verification,
- semantics, logic and formal models of programs,
- partial evaluation, mixed computation, and abstract interpretation,
- program analysis, understanding and visualization.

              Program Methodology and Information Technologies:
- object-oriented programming,
- generic programming,
- parallel and distributed computing,
- database and information systems.

              Artificial Intelligence:
- knowledge engineering,
- natural language processing,
- AI tools and applications
- constraint programming and multi-agent technology.

In addition to papers in the above list of topics, papers both
bridging the gap between different directions and promoting mutual
understanding of researchers in different directions are welcome.
Papers defining the prospects of Computer Science in the whole and
joint West-East papers are also encouraged.

LOCATION

The conference will be held in Akademgorodok (Academy town), 30 km
South from Novosibirsk, the largest city of Siberia. Akademgorodok is
located in a picturesque place near the Ob lake. It is surrounded
with birch and pine forests and pleasant not only for work but for
recreation as well. Silence, beautiful landscape, and pure air are
the factors promoting scientific activity and creativity.
