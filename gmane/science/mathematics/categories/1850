but didn't joyal and moerdijk actually write a book about it? i think they call it
successor, but the standard model is x|-->{x}. (or did i mix it all up?)

i didn't say that set theory provides tree representations of ZF sets; ZF sets
*are* trees (or acyclic rooted graphs). i said that set theory provides tree
representation of *abstract* sets. think of lazy natural numbers, flat natural
numbers, finite chains, all of them different *and useful* representations of the
same abstract set.

the words "obviously" and "practice" don't go together well. 20 years ago, it
seemed obvious that complexity theory was mostly an academic whim. nowadays, the
security infrastructure built upon it is a critical part of the engineering
practices, and the very life of the net. large cardinals may still find unexpected
applications, say in establishing the new tax policies =;0
