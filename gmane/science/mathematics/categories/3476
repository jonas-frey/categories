Dear Steve,

Thank you for your kind words. I have mentioned my paper with Aurelio only
because there are too many details that I could not describe in a brief
email message. But if it comes to "...I should have mentioned explicitly
your work with Aurelio...", I can say the same about myself: I should have
mentioned your (very important!) paper

[A. Carboni, S. Lack, and R. F. C. Walters, Introduction to extensive and
distributive categories, Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 84, 1993,
145-158]

and Bill Lawvere's original question about commutative rings and many other
things that Aurelio did mention in his CT1999 talk. (In any case, I hope you
do not assume that I know what "Coq" is, do you?)

Yours-

George

Dear George,

I remember well your lovely talk and paper, and indeed I had this
in mind when I wrote. I shouldn't have used the words "extra structure"
(in fact I said this really because I don't know what "Coq" is) and I
should have mentioned explicitly your work with Aurelio.

Sorry.

Steve.
