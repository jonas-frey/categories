Dear Albert,

In the case where T is a 2-monad with rank, and the pseudomorphisms are (as
usual) assumed to be coherent, then this was proved by Blackwell-Kelly-Powe=
r
in the paper 2-dimensional monad theory. (Here "rank" means that the
2-functor T preserves alpha-filtered colimit for some alpha - without some
such assumption, I don't know how you can prove that the left adjoint j
exists, and I suspect it does not.)

If T has rank but pseudomorphisms are not required to be coherent, then the
adjoint j will exist, but the morphism A-->ijA need not be an equivalence
(take the identity monad for example).

If T is not even a 2-monad then I'm not sure what coherence of the 2-cells
would mean, but in any case there will be problems.

Regards,

Steve Lack.
