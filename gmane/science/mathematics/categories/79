For goodness' sake, Vaughan! How many times do I have to tell you that
I'm talking about *the underlying object* of the final coalgebra, and
not its order structure or its topology? If the underlying object of
the lexicographic product is the ordinary (cartesian) product -- and
if it's not, then I don't know what it is -- then it distributes over
sums because that's what products do in a topos.

The order structure can't do any sort of "attaching" that negates the
complementedness of the underlying subobject, and neither can the
topology. The only thing that can do that is to make identifications
between endpoints -- i.e. to use "glue" a la Freyd.
