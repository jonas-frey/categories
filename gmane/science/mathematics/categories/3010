  * submission of abstracts (deadline Feb 27!)

 The International Category Theory Conference (CT) covers all areas of
 pure and applied category theory. Topics of interest include, but are
 not limited to: higher dimensional categories, categorical logic,
 applications of categories in algebra, topology, combinatorics, and
 other areas of mathematics, applications of category theory to
 computer science, physics and other mathematical sciences. Previous
 meetings in this series were held in Vancouver (2004), Como (2000),
 Coimbra (1999), Vancouver (1997), Halifax (1995), Tours (1994), Isle
 of Thorns (1992), Montreal (1991), and Como (1990).

 CT 2006 will be held at White Point Beach Resort
 (http://www.whitepoint.com/), a seaside resort in Nova Scotia
 (Canada), about 100 minutes' drive from Halifax. It will be an active
 research-oriented conference, in something of an "Oberwolfach style".
 All those interested in category theory and its applications are
 welcome.

INVITED SPEAKERS: ***NEW***

 The scientific committee has chosen five invited speakers, of whom
 the following four have already confirmed their participation:

 Kathryn Hess (EPF Lausanne)
 Steve Lack (University of Western Sydney)

GRADUATE STUDENT SUPPORT: ***NEW***

 Please encourage your graduate students to attend this conference. A
 limited amount of funding will be available to support the
 participation of graduate students. Students wishing to apply for
 this money should contact the organizers at ct06@mathstat.dal.ca by
 FEBRUARY 15, and include the following information:

   1. A one-page email letter stating your background as well as why
      you are interested in attending the conference.
   2. The letter should also describe any other sources of funding
      available to you to attend.
   3. An email letter of reference from your supervisor or an
