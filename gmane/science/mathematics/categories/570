Colin's question, which essentially asks for a solution to the proportion
abelian groups:groups :: abelian category:x
does not of course have a unique answer.  One solution was exact
category and that was definitely one of the things I had in mind.  In
fact, I think I even said so.  From my current vantage, I would add
the following two properties: pointed and Mal'cev.  For an equational
category, that is almost enough to force a group structure (associativity
is missing).  I don't know how to force associativity by categorical
properties, but pointed, exact and Mal'cev has to come awfully close
to answering the question.
