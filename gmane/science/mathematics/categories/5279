Hi Colin,
here are my answers to questions you asked me in your last two postings (=
living
now our terminological misunderstanding aside).


CM: Do you mean that every formalized axiom system uses arithmetical
notions such as "finite string of symbols." =A0This is why that formal
axioms cannot be the real basis of our knowledge of math, but it has
no more bearing on categorical axioms than any others.

AR: No I did not mean this. Agree that this argument has no more bearing,=
 etc.


CM: Or do you think that pre-formal notions of "set" or "collection" are
all based on iterated membership and Zermelo's form of the axiom of
extensionality, so that CCAF is less basic than ZFC? =A0That is a common
belief among logicians who have not read Zermelo's critique of Cantor
(where Zermelo points out that Cantor did not hold these beliefs) and
who know a great deal more of ZFC than of other mathematics.


AR: No. I certainly do NOT think that pre-formal notions of "set" or
"collection" are all based on iterated membership and Zermelo's form of t=
he
axiom of extensionality. I explain in the next entry what I do think abou=
t this
matter.



CM: In fact, long before mathematicians could analyze the continuum into =
a
discrete set of points plus a topology, they were well aware of
collections like the collection of rigid motions of the plane -- and
that "collection" is a category. =A0It is not just a ZFC set of motions
but comes with composition of motions and with an object that the
motions act on.


AR: True, the most general notion of =93collection=94 one can imagine may=
 cover
=93category=94 and whatnot. But, I claim, the preformal notion of colecti=
on
*relevant to the axiomatic method in its modern form* is more specific, a=
nd
does NOT cover the preformal notion of category. I=92m talking about =93s=
ystems of
things=94 in the sense of Hilbert 1899 rather than sets in the sense of Z=
FC or of
any other axiomatic theory of sets. The idea of *this* axiomatic method (=
not to
be confused with other versions of axiomatic method like Euclid=92s) is, =
very
roughly, this. One thinks of collection of =93bare=94 unrelated individua=
ls and
then introduces certain relations between these individuals through axiom=
s.
Objects of a theories obtained in this way are sets provided with relatio=
ns
between their elements, i.e. =93structured sets=94 (or better to say =93s=
tructured
collections=94.

The principal feature of the preformal notion of collection involved here=
 is
that elements of such a collection are unrelated. Because of this feature=
 the
collection in question is not a general category. (It might be perhaps th=
ought
of as a discrete category but this fact has no bearing on my argument.)
The idea of building theories *of sets* using the version of axiomatic me=
thod
just described is in fact controversial: it amounts to thinking of sets a=
s bare
preformal sets provided with the relation of membership. I mention this l=
atter
problem (which is not relevant to my argument) only for stressing that th=
e
notion of set or collection I have in mind talking about categorical foun=
dation
is NOT one that has any specific relevance to ZFC or any other axiomatic.

In ETC (the Elementary Theory of Categories in the sense of Bill=92s 1966=
 paper)
categories are conceived as collections of things called =93morphisms=94 =
provided
with relations called =93domain=94, =93codomain=94 and =93composition=94 =
(I hope I nothing
forgot). The notion of collection involved in this construction  is MORE =
BASIC
than the resulting notion of category simply because this very axiomatic =
method
is designed to work similarly in different situations - for doing axiomat=
ic
theories of sets and of whatnot. Even if there are pragmatic reasons to b=
uild
theories of sets like ETCS and other mathematical theories on the basis o=
f ETC
rather than use axiomatic theories of sets like ZFC for doing category th=
eory
and the rest of mathematics, this doesn=92t change the above argument.

CM: What is a "formal basis" of a theory T? =A0

AR: I called ETC =93formal basis=94 of BT (=93Basic Theory of Categories=94=
 in the sense
of Bill=92s 1966=92s paper) meaning the two-level structure of BC. BC is =
ETC plus
some other axioms. Conceptually the order of introduction of these axioms
matters. My point (or rather guess) is that BC involves a prototype of a =
new
axiomatic method (different from one I described above), which, however,
doesn=92t work in the given form independently. I=92m not quite prepared =
to defend
any general notion of formal basis - I didn=92t mean to introduce such a =
general
notion and didn=92t think about a general rule.

CM: The Eilenberg-MacLane axioms are a subtheory of CCAF and also have a
natural, conceptually central interpretation in CCAF. =A0I consider this
an insight, Bill's insight, and I do not see how it becomes any kind
of objection to CCAF.

AR: The subtheory you are talking about is what I call ETC in these posti=
ngs,
right? I hope I understand it coorectly what you mean by "natural, concep=
tual
central interpretation in CCAF" - the fact that any object in CCAF is a m=
odel
of ETC, right? Now, the objection is this:
ETC involves the preformal notion of collection that can NOT be thought o=
f as a
category (for the reason I tried to explain above).

In addition to the above argument my conclusion about CCAF is also based =
on the
following historical observation.  Every major historical shift in founda=
tions
of mathematics so far involved a major change of the notion of axiomatic
method. (I can substantiate the claim if you'll ask.) But ETC (and, forma=
lly
speaking, the whole of CCAF) relies on the old Hilbert-Tarski-style axiom=
atic
method.

best,
Andrei
