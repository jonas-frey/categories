PARTICIPATION AND TRAVEL GRANTS
-------------------------------
To be considered for a grant, you need to submit an application, with
file name:

NLS2017-grant-application-Your-Names.pdf

via EasyChair on this link:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nls2017

On the bottom of the submission page of EasyChair, under Topics, you
need to check the box "Grant application", before uploading your
application.

The application must contain the following documents, in one PDF document:

(1) Letter of Application for a grant, stating your logic-related interests
(2) academic records or transcripts of courses taken so far that
demonstrate your background in logic
(3) Letter of Recommendation from your current or most recent supervisor

----
Note 1: In case your recommender prefers to send the recommendation
directly, she/he should send it as an email attachment of a pdf file named:

Letter-of-Recommendation-Your-Names.pdf

to the following email address:

nls2017-grants@math.su.se <mailto:nls2017-grants@math.su.se>

Email Subject: Letter-of-Recommendation-Your-Name.pdf

Note 2: "Your-Names" should be your actual first and family name,
without spaces.

Note 3: In case the originals are not in English, the best is to provide
scans of official, certified translations. If that would be problematic,
you should supplement the scans of the originals with translations that
