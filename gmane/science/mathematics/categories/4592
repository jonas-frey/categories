Of course, you are right about a point, I missed it! I must confess I did=
n't
think about this example in precise terms. My claim is that sketch theory
doesn't fit the structuralist (Bourbaki-Hilbertian) pattern. It hardly
precisely fits the ancient Euclidean pattern either but there is a sugges=
tive
analogy, which concerns the idea that certain basic objects like point, l=
ine
and circle *generate* the rest.
A further claim is this: a specific reason *why* sketch theory doesn't fi=
t the
structuralist pattern is that in sketch theory (like in CT in general)
isomorphisms don't have the same distinguished status.
