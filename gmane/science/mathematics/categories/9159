Dear Category Theoreticians,=20

The following book may be of interest to some of you, since it sets out =
the diagrammatic languages of symmetric monoidal categories, compact =
closed categories, Frobenius algebras, and many more structures, but in =
their own right in order to make the book accessible to a very wide =
audiences e.g. physicists, linguists, engineers, philosophers...

This book gives a complete introduction to quantum foundations and =
quantum computation, developed from first principles using diagrams (or =
equivalently, algebraic structures internal to a monoidal category). It =
follows the courses given by us at Oxford for the past 4 years (and =
starting at Radboud this year), mainly for mathematicians and computer =
scientists at advanced undergrad/masters level. The conceptual focus is =
on processes and composition, and many of the methods can be extended =
beyond quantum theory to other theories of interacting processes.

A 20% reduction is given when using the code COECKE2017 at check-out
