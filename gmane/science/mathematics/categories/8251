For a number of years, I made most of my papers available at an ftp site 
at McGill which is now defunct.  It was also not always up-to-date.  I 
have a new one that is, for the the being, up-to-date.  If you enter 
http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/papers/ in your browser, it will take you 
to the index, currently by production date.  Eventually, I will add a 
subject index as well.  Right now it includes most of my lifetime 
production (except most of what was published in Lecture Notes) and a few 
other things such as the Grothendieck translation and some notes on rings 
of continuous functions by Fine, Gilman, and Lambek from about 1960 that 
was published by McGill with no copyright notice (anyway, I got Lambek's 
and Gillman's permissions (but Fine was dead and I could not trace his 
widow or his daughter).  My only connection was that I supervised the 
texxing of the notes.
