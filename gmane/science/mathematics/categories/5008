The generic-seeming example "phenomenon/phenomena" certainly *suggests*
a parallel "skeleton/skeleta" -- but it would also suggest "polygon/polyg=
a",
which I think we all would agree is nonsense. Peter is merely (justifiabl=
y)
pointing out that "skeleton/skeleta" is as much nonsense as "polygon/poly=
ga",
and I'm with him 100% on that score.

[As for the plural of "topos", I guess I'm in the mugwump camp that would=

*write* it as "topoi" (pace Peter), but *pronounce* it as "toposes" :-) .=

English was never very strong at phonetic consistency of pronunciation;
witness GBShaw's "phonetic" spelling of FISH: "ghotip".]

Cheers, -- Fred

PS: "ghotip"? "gh" as in COUGH, "o" as in WOMEN, =

"ti" as in NATION, and "p" (silent) as in PNEUMONIA.
