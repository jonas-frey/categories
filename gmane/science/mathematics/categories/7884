Dear all,

I have recently been wondering about the notion of "quality type"
introduced by Lawvere in [_Axiomatic cohesion_]: given an extensive
category S, a quality type over S is an extensive category F equipped
with a fully faithful functor S -> F that has a simultaneous left and
right adjoint. There are two classes of examples of quality types over
Set that I know of:

(a) Hurewicz-style homotopy categories obtained from categories of
cohesion [loc. cit.], including e.g. the classical homotopy category
of CW or Kan complexes
(b) The toposes of presheaves on a small category with a zero object
(which, by splitting idempotents, includes the toposes of M-sets where
M is a monoid with a two-sided absorbing element)

These seem to be the examples Lawvere was thinking about: (a) are
"extensive qualities" and (b) are "intensive qualities". What is not
clear to me is what these two examples have in common, or more
generally, what is the significance of the functor S -> F having a
simultaneous left and right adjoint. I would be very grateful for any
insights people may have.

Sincerely,
