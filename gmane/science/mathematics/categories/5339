In reply to Andr=E9 :


What seems reasonable to do is analysis, namely what is behind the=20
success of category theory and how is this success  related to the=20
progress of mathematics.
Which implies asking questions of mathematics, some of which have been=20
aired in this discussion list. In this way, it should be possible to=20
avoid seeming partisan, but to ask serious questions, which should help=20
to steer directions, or suggest new ones. Of course lots of great maths=20
does not arise in this way, but by following one's nose, but that does=20
not mean that such analysis of direction is unhelpful.

I know some argue that this excursion into what might be called the=20
theory of knowledge, or into methodology,  seems unnecessary to some. In=20
reply I sometimes point to remarks of Einstein on my web site
www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/einst.html
or more mundanely retort that normal activities normally require some=20
meta discussion: if you want to go on a holiday, you do some planning,=20
you don't just rush to the station and buy some tickets. I develop this=20
theme in relation to the teaching of mathematics in an article
What should be the output of mathematical education?
on my popularisation and teaching page.

I gave a talk to school children on `How mathematics gets into knots' in=20
the 1980s, and a teacher came up to me afterwards and said: `That is the=20
first time in my mathematical career that anyone has used the word=20
`analogy' in relation to mathematics.' Yet abstraction is about analogy,=20
and very powerful it is too. This was part of the motivation behind the=20
article
146. (with T. Porter) `Category Theory: an abstract setting for analogy=20
and comparison', In: What is Category Theory? Advanced Studies in=20
Mathematics and Logic, Polimetrica Publisher, Italy, (2006) 257-274. pdf

There is also interest in the question of how category theory comes to=20
be successful, and more successful than, say,  the theory of monoids.=20
This seems connected with the underlying geometric structure being a=20
directed graph, i.e. allowing a `geography of interaction'. A category=20
is also a partial algebraic structure, with domain of definition of the=20
operation defined by a geometric condition. Is this enough to explain=20
the success?

It is worth noting that the article
Atiyah, Michael, Mathematics in the 20th century, Bull. London Math.=20
Soc., {34},  {2002}, 1--15,
suggests that important trends in the 20th century were:
                              higher dimensions, commutative to non=20
commutative, local-to-global, and the unification of mathematics,
but does not include the words `category' or `groupoid', let alone=20
`higher dimensional algebra'!

This kind of analysis needs to be presented to other scientists, and to=20
the public, not only to mathematicians. There is a hunger for knowing=20
what mathematics is really up to, in common language as far as possible,=20
what new concepts, ideas, etc., and not just `we have solved Fermat's=20
last theorem'.

If your analysis of what category theory should do suggests some gaps,=20
then that is an opportunity for work!

Good luck

Ronnie Brown

It is probably the most important mathematical developpement of the 20th =

But we cant say that publically.
