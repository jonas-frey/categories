Eduardo:
   For a small cat of finite sets: Why not use the Von Neumann hierarchy (up
to omega) for objects, and all set
functions as arrows. These are the "hereditarily finite sets"

    V(0) = empty set

   V(n+1) = P(V(n))

V(omega) = U{V(n): n in omega}

I would not call it "the" cat of finite sets, since there uncountably many
countable models of ZF. Obviously the choice of ZF, rather than say Zermelo
set theory or some other foundation is also pretty arbitrary.
Best,
   J. Lipton
