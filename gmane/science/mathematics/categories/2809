Vaughan, David

An interesting question!

It raises several possible red herrings.

1) What is a lax action of a group (or groupoid) G on a group (or groupoid)
A? There is a paper by Brylinski in Cahier on this, with applications to
K-theory, if I remember rightly.

Another interpretation of this seems to be as a Schreier cocycle (factor
set). A relevant paper is

97. (with T. PORTER), ``On the Schreier theory of non-abelian
extensions: generalisations and computations''. {\em Proceedings
Royal Irish Academy} 96A (1996) 213-227.

It is a useful exercise (which I meant to write down, but ...) to translate
Brylinski into the terms of a map of a free crossed resolution, and so put
this into nonabelian cohomology terms, and potentially allow for calculation
using a small free crossed resoution when possible ....

This suggests what might be  a lax action, but does not complete in an
obvious way into a lax crossed module.

2) Another way is to go to 2-crossed modules (Daniel Conduche), which brings
in relations with simplicial groups (Tim Porter) and higher Peiffer
elements. See also the relations with braided crossed modules and other
things in
59.  (with N.D. GILBERT), ``Algebraic models of 3-types and
automorphism  structures for crossed modules'', {\em Proc. London
Math. Soc.} (3) 59 (1989)  51-73.

3) There are equivalences of categories

crossed modules of groupoids  <--> 2-groupoids   <--> double groupoids with
connections
<--> double groupoids with thin elements.

I have long found the cubical approach easier to follow and to use than the
globular, but it turns out one needs also the globular to define commutative
cubes in cubical omega-categories with connections (see a recent paper by
Philip Higgins in TAC).

This raises the question of "lax cubical omega-categories with connections".
What do you laxify, to get an equivalence with one or other notion of weak
globular (or other?) omega-category??!!

Quite an amusing step, and more do-able,  would be to generalise Gray
categories to: cubical omega-categories C with an algebra structure C
\otimes C \to C, generalising Brown-Gilbert, and using the monoidal closed
structure given in

116. (with F.A. AL-AGL and R. STEINER), `Multiple categories: the
equivalence between a globular and cubical approach', Advances in
Mathematics, 170 (2002) 71-118

A nice point about such algebra structures is that they allow for a failure
of the interchange law, with a measure of that failure, similar to  the way
2-crossed modules give a measure of the failure of the Peiffer law for a
crossed module by using a map { , }: P_1 \times P_1 \to P_2. Is this related
to Sjoerd Crans' teisi?

I have a gut feeling that these strengthened sesquicategories (with a
*measure* of the failure of the interchange law) will crop up in a variety
of situations, e.g. in rewriting, 2-dimensional holonomy, ...., since the
interchange law makes things too abelian, sometimes.

This brings in automorphism structures for crossed modules, I guess
(Brown-Gilbert again, and of course derived from JHC Whitehead, who first
studied such automorphisms).

Another thought: the non abelian tensor product of groups derives from
properties of the commutator map on groups. Why not develop the
corresponding theory for the Peiffer commutator map?

Hope that helps

Ronnie

I'd be interested in knowing this too, in particular what the geometric
significance of laxness is.  Presumably laxness only enters in the
passage from pre-crossed to crossed.

I have been looking at categorical groups a little and was wondering
what a lax crossed module is. A search through various databases has
turned up nothing. It would seem that they should be like crossed
modules but only satisfy a weakened equivariance property.

Any pointers toward a definition would be great.
