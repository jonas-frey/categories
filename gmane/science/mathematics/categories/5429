dear andre,

first of all, i would like to thank you again for this invigorating
thread. it seems that we are getting to some points that seem to be of
general interest, so i'll add some comments.

physicists and category theorists are certainly drawing very similar
string diagrams. the *meaning* of these diagrams is, however, not
completely identical.

for physicists, string diagrams are a convenient shorthand for some
constructions with hilbert spaces and operators.

for category theorists, string diagrams represent constructions
available in any category with enough structure.

how important is this difference? more precisely, how important is it to
go beyond hilbert spaces and look for some ***nonstandard models***?

most physicists would probably say that they are happy with hilbert
spaces. but many of them (albeit mostly theoreticians) ar enot. von
neumann was very unhappy, and worked a lot to provide
alternatives. and failed. but many people are thinking hard about "toy
models" these days, capturing certain quantum phenomena and not other,
generating some independence results, axiomatics etc.

maybe category theory can help with this. (eg, bob coecke et al's
recent work, as well as some bits that i have worked on, show that
some crucial quantum phenomena, even entire quantum algorithms, can be
represented using funny constructions with relations.) of course, my
view of this may be biased, and nonstandard models of quantum
mechanics may be irrelevant. but this is just one direction, showing a
general way in which popping up from concrete sense into abstract
nonsense may be a good thing.

i cannot agree with this more. my first post in this thread was that
maybe we should not advertise too much, but just make our tools
available. ("nature will find the way" says the mathematician in
jurassic park)

oh but is that a bad thing? differential calculus was first physics,
and then captured a lot of other things as well. and some of it did
not reflect back into physics.

as a computer scientist, i tend to think of quantum mechanics as a
theory of a particular computational resource: **entanglement**. it
seems to me that this concept raises fundamental worries for every
computer scientist --- completely independent on its physical
realisation.

church's thesis said that computability was a very robust notion:
whatever kind of a computer you take, you can compute the same. and
for a while, it seemed that feasibility would be similar: there are
various complexity classes, but they are all strictly subexponential
with respect to each other. --- then came quantum algorithms with
their "exponential beast", lurking from entanglement.

now we know that computation happens in many models: on the internet,
in a cell, distributed among the members of a mailing list. can some
of them compute essenticall more than others?

i don't know much about physics, but i cannot stay away from thinking
about entanglement, and tensors, and string diagrams...

with the very best wishes,
-- dusko


PS re **nonstandard models** again, i am wondering whether the
hasegawa-hoffman-plotkin-selinger (HHPS) results, referred to by peter
selinger, imply that there are no nonstandard models.

the HHPS results say that a diagram commutes in a dagger-compact (resp
compact, traced monoidal) category if and only if it holds in finitely
dimensional hilbert (resp vector) spaces. so if a nonstandard model
must be dagger compact, then anything validated in it must be
validated in hilbert spaces? that would pretty much kill my
nonstandard models, wouldn't it?

i am not sure that i completely understand the HHPS results (so please
correct me if i am wrong), but it does not seem to me that they
provide anything like a representation theorem.

a representation theorem, say for abelian categories, says something
like: you give me a small abelian category AA, and i produce a ring R
and an embedding AA--->Mod-R.

in contrast, the HHPS theorems say: you give me a diagram D that
commutes in a dagger-compact category, and i provide a field K such
that that D also commutes in FHilb_K.

so for every D, i need to construcat a new field K_D, right?

well, this would provide an embedding of a dagger compact-category CC
into FHilb_H for some field H only if there was a way to all fields
K_D for all diagrams D that commute in CC into one big field H. how
much hope is there for that? and even if i could do that, it would
take some massage to embed FHilb_H into the standard model, consisting
of *complex* hilbert spaces.

so i still think that hilbert space may be a needlessly big place.
