deciding whether the involution on a category should be written as a
dagger or as a star sounds to me a bit like deciding whether a
polynomial should be in x or in y. i worked with people who use the
dagger, and didnt work with people who use the star, but it would be
good if i could keep my options open.

but anyway, denoting the math structures by the typographic symbols used
in them sounds like an amusing idea. after a hundred years of progress
in creating new structures, and metafonting new symbols for them, we'll
probably be in possession of a fairly rich new language of hieroglyphs.
