The paper I was referring to is the one that first introduced
anafunctors, so I think he's been aware of it since the beginning (I
suspect it was a primary motivation, even).  The word "morally" was my
own weasel word, to cover the fact that I didn't have time to look up
the paper and remind myself what precisely he actually wrote.  (-:

Ah, thanks.  That makes sense.  The question about the effective topos
is also intriguing!

Are there any interesting non-Grothendieck elementary toposes which
are known to satisfy the axiom of stack completions?  (By
"interesting" I mean to exclude toposes such as the category of sets
smaller than some strong limit cardinal -- not to say that such
toposes are not interesting for other purposes.)
