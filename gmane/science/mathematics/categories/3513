Dear Gabor,

In support of those who raised their voice in this matter (namely, Marco
Grandis), I would like to say that although maybe naive, this alarm call is
surely not even mildly hypocritical. Notice that to protest against one
particular issue does not exclude protesting about others, surely more
fundamental as you rightly point out in this case. For this reason, I think
that your questioning in the paragraph below is out of order and calls for a
retraction. It seems to me that you assume too much about those who were
brave enough to let us all be aware of this issue, and to whom we should be
grateful.

In a more detailed answer to this paragraph, I firmly believe (from
first-hand knowledge) that the same worried scientists who would sign a
petition to criticize Reed-Elsevier would also sign petitions against
unjustified wars and invasions, such as those perpetrated by the current US
government and its allies (and that includes the UK and Israel -- although I
find that the latter is a trickier issue and tends to be simplistically
confused with antisemitism). Any of such actions may be considered naive in
view of the results they cause (well -- not always! see the recent US
elections) -- nevertheless it is the duty of any conscientious scientist to
raise his/her voice against any crimes against humanity, regardless of who
perpetrates them.

The case of Reed-Elsevier touches us more closely than any other, as (say)
mathematicians who publish in reputed journals cannot simply ignore Journal
of Pure and Aplided Algebra, Topology, Advances in Mathematics, etc. This
case, unlike the larger and more fundamental issues, is within our reach,
and that is what makes it so special. I fully agree with Marco Grandis
having raised the alarm in this forum, precisley for this reason.
Unlike you,  I am not wondering why is he (or others) not doing likewise
with other causes in this same forum. The reason is simple -- this is an
ACADEMIC matter and therefore, as academics (not politicians), we can in
principle do something effective about it. We may individually sign lots of
other petitions, write letters to newspapers, and disseminate difficult to
get inflormation colncerning the larger and more fundamental  issues. But to
bring those larger issues to the attention of this forum would, in my view,
and I am sure also in the view of ther moderators,  be inappropriate. This,
on the other hand, is not.


I understand that the entire editorial board of Topology recently resigned
as a protest against their profiteering (without much effort -- who does the
writing of papers, refereeing, preparing camera ready articles or
proofreading? not them -- yet they charge outrageous prices for their
journals), knowing far too well that Thirld World countries cannot afford
such outrageous subsciptions. Would it be possible to promote such an action
for this far more important issue of arms dealing (a worse case of
profiteering and also more inmoral as it concerns human lives, not "just"
access to scikentific journals)?

To end, I largely agree with your concerns. I am only asking you to be less
judgemental in your assesments without analysing the situation further. It
may be unjust and hence unnecessarily insulting.

Best wishes,
Marta
