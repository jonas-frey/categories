TOPIC

Quantum informatics lies at the interface of mathematics, computer 
science,
and physics. Understanding quantum computing in enough detail to allow its
large-scale deployment will clearly transform our society, but there are
several obstructions. The most fundamental ones run straight to the heart
of the counterintuitiveness of quantum theory: one can only extract data
from a quantum system from one classical viewpoint at a time. Learning 
more
requires combining measurements from multiple classical viewpoints.
Addressing this issue will advance our theoretical understanding of nature
and at the same time has practical benefits to quantum technology.

This workshop brings together researchers working on this topic and
thematically related areas. It aims to inspire new collaborations and
provide an opportunity for young researchers to expand their horizons. 
This
is an interdisciplinary workshop, and not a specialist conference. The 
goal
is not to preach to the converted but to reach out to others. The 
programme
leaves plenty of opportunities for discussion.
