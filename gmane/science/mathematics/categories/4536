I am trying to understand model-checking logics such as=20
linear temporal logic (LTL), computation tree logic (CTL),
and probabilistic extensions such as probabilistic computation
tree logic (PCTL).  These logics seem to be useful in model-
checking because of correspondences between recursive=20
definitions of formulas and recursive algorithms for
computing them.  Syntactic inference and any semantics
other than the few (transition systems, DTMCs, MDPs, etc.) for=20
which the logics were developed seem not to be of interest,=20
however.  Translation theorems such as D1.4.7, D1.4.12, and
D4.3.13 of Johnstone's "Elephant" are not applied, as far as=20
I have found.

Here are some initial thoughts based on my very limited=20
knowledge of categorical logic.  The temporal logic operators=20
"next", "eventually", and "always" may, for example,=20
be formulated using a propositional signature. Let A be a set=20
whose elements are thought of as state labels.  The set of=20
atomic propositions is {a_n | a in A, n in N}.  The following=20
are Horn formulas:

Next^n[a]       =3D a_n

Always^k[a]     =3D a_0 \wedge ... \wedge a_k

T^k[a, b]       =3D a_0 \wedge ... \wedge a_{k-1} \wedge b_k

The following are coherent formulas:

Until^k[a, b]   =3D T^0[a, b] \vee ... \vee T^k[a, b]

Eventually^k[a] =3D a_0 \vee ... \vee a_k

The following are geometric formulas:

Until[a, b]     =3D \vee_i T^i[a, b]

Eventually[a]   =3D \vee_i a_i

The following is infinitary:

Always[a]       =3D \wedge_i a_i.

Alternatively, these notions can be formulated as a=20
first-order theory with basic sorts "States" and "Paths". =20
It has function symbols

start : Paths -> States

shift : Paths -> Paths

and a set A of of relation symbols=20

a |-> States.

PCTL can be formulated as a \tau-theory.  It has basic sorts=20
States and Paths as above as well as the function symbols=20
start and shift.  It also has function symbols=20

Prob_{<p}:P(Paths) -> P(States)=20

(similarly for \leq, >, and \geq) for 0 \leq p\leq 1 and

Cost_{<c}:P(S) -> P(S)=20

(similarly for \leq, >, and \geq) for 0 \leq c.

There are certainly other presentations of these theories. =20
Finally, here are a few questions.

Has anyone studied the model-checking logics using the tools
of categorical logic?

What interactions exist between bisimulation/probabilistic=20
bisimulation and the logics?

What role could categorical logic have in developing model-
checking algorithms?

How can the usual semantics of these theories (e.g., DTMC=20
semantics for PCTL) be viewed categorically (e.g., in the=20
topos Set by interpreting the sorts simply as sets of states
and paths)?

Any other thoughts, suggestions, or references would be=20
appreciated.
