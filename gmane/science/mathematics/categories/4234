[Note from moderator: Please cc: any expressions of interest to

TAC has been in existence now for 13 years.  For about the first half of
its existence, Bob did everything to get papers ready for publication.  He
did consult with me if he had particular tex problems.  About when I
retired, I took on the task of preparing papers (most of them) for
publication.  However I am uncomfortable with being the only one who
really understands what is going on with tac.cls.  I would like to find a
volunteer to back me up, with a view to eventually taking over when the
times comes, as it must, that I can no longer do the job.

The job is not onerous.  We get about 20 papers a year.  On average, a
paper takes a couple hours of preparation.  Sometimes it is more, but
often there is essentially no prep time since the author has used tac.cls
and made no formatting errors.

I am not planning on stopping this any time soon, but I think it is past
time to prepare for the future.

Michael
