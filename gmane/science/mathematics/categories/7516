Description
-----------

Over the past few years, deep and surprising connections have emerged
between type theory and homotopy theory.  These links provide a previously
unavailable topological intuition for working with type theories and are
at the heart of Voevodsky's Univalent Foundations of Mathematics
programme.  This programme seeks to develop mathematics on the basis of
type theories that include axioms motivated by homotopy theory, such as
the Univalence Axiom, with an associated
formalisation within proof assistants based on type theory, such as Coq
and Adga.  Ongoing research in this area involves also higher-dimensional
category theory.

This conference aims at bringing together leading experts in type theory
and homotopy theory, as well as interested researchers from related areas
such as mathematical logic, theoretical computer science and category
theory, to exchange the latest results and ideas, and to set out
directions for further exploration of the subject.  The conference is
timed to serve also as a venue for presenting the advances made during the
special year on Univalent Foundations at the Institute for Advanced Study.
