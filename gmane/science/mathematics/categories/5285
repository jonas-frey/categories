I am curious to know how all this fits with partial algebraic=20
operations. The axioms for a groupoid allow for the empty groupoid. That=20
reminds me that Philip Higgins wrote about partial algebraic structures i=
n

@article {Higgins-algebrawithoperators,
    AUTHOR =3D {Higgins, Philip J.},
     TITLE =3D {Algebras with a scheme of operators},
   JOURNAL =3D {Math. Nachr.},
  FJOURNAL =3D {Mathematische Nachrichten},
    VOLUME =3D {27},
      YEAR =3D {1963},
     PAGES =3D {115--132},
      ISSN =3D {0025-584X},
   MRCLASS =3D {18.10},
  MRNUMBER =3D {MR0163940 (29 \#1239)},
MRREVIEWER =3D {A. Heller},
}

and he told me that years later he got a paper from a computer scientist=20
saying `Higgins' theorem is true as stated' , which apparently concerned=20
the empty structure!

Does anyone on this list know a reference for axioms for group theory=20
which are related to Dakin's axioms for a simplicial T-complex;
1) degenerate implies thin;
2) every horn has a unique thin filler;
3) if all faces but one of a thin element are thin, then so also is the=20
remaining face.

The last axiom is related to associativity. I am sure I had a reference=20
at one time, but have lost it.
