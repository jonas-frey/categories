Dear Bill=2C

Thank you very much for all these interesting comments and suggestions=2C w=
e'll think of them.
We also received others from Ronnie Brown=2C Marta Bunge and Bob Pare=3B we=
  are preparing a revised version.

I am quite convinced of the importance of presheaves on nonempty finite set=
s. Just for the pleasure of friendly=20
discussing=2C let me add that I like calling them 'symmetric simplicial set=
s' :-) - a term against which you protested=20
sometime ago=2C in this list if I remember well=3B at least in a context wh=
ere their links with simplicial sets and
algebraic topology are relevant.

On the other hand=2C I think that the classical term of 'simplicial complex=
' is misleading.
In fact=2C they sit inside symmetric simplicial sets (not inside simplicial=
  sets) as the objects that=20
'live on their points'=2C according to your terminology. I used for them th=
e term 'combinatorial space'=2C
while I used 'directed combinatorial space' for the (non classical) directe=
d analogue (sitting inside=20
simplicial sets)=2C whose objects are defined by privileged finite sequence=
s instead of privileged finite subsets.I think that the opposition between =
non-directed and directed notions should be kept clear.
Thanks again and best wishes    Marco

Dear Ettore and Marco

Much of your very interesting paper is actually taking place=20
in an unjustly neglected topos.

The classifying topos for nontrivial Boolean algebras is concretely just=20
presheaves on nonempty finite sets. It was one of two examples in my=20
1988 Macquarie talk "Toposes generated by codiscrete objects in=20
algebraic topology and functional analysis" *

Like many non-localic toposes=2C this one unites pair of identical=20
but adjointly opposite copies of the base topos of abstract sets=2C
namely a subtopos of codiscretes and its negation=2C the subcategory of
discretes or constant presheaves. Because in this very special case
the Yoneda inclusion is a restriction of  the codiscrete inclusion=2C=20
it is well justified to consider this topos as "codiscretely generated "=20
(wrt colimits).

This topos contains the category of groupoids as a full reflective subcateg=
ory.
In fact the reflector preserves finite products=2C and is a refinement of=20
the syntax for presenting groups. It should probably be=20
considered as the fundamental combinatorial Poincare functor .

That point of view requires viewing the objects of the topos as=20
combinatorial spaces=2C which  is out of fashion even though a
full coreflective subcategory is that of classical simplicial complexes=20
( or "simplicial schemes"according to Godement).  The fear is that
geometric realization will not be exact. But as Joyal and Wraith=20
pointed out 30 years ago=2C one need only replace the usual interval  with =
the weak
infinite-dimensional sphere as basic parameterizer (of Zitterbewegungen=20
instead of ordinary paths ?) in order to obtain  a geometric mo=10rphism
of the singular/realization kind from any reasonable topological topos.

Actually the groupoids  are already at a low level in the sequence of
essential subtoposes: if the trivial topos is taken as level minus infinity=
=2C
the discrete as level zero=2C and the lowest level whose skeleton functor=20
detects connectivity as level one=2C then the lowest level whose UIAO is
compatible seems to be three.  Explicit consideration of the role of the
groupoids may a  help in calculating the precise Aufhebung  function.

Best wishes
Bill

*the other example was the Gaeta topos on countably  infinite sets=2C=20
closely related to the Kolmogoroff-Mackey bornological generalizations of
Banach spaces=2C which are  vector space objects in that topos. 		 	   		  =
