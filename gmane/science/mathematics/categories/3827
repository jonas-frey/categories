In reply to Jeff Egger:

Actions by monoidal categories were considered by Benabou in 1967
("Intoduction to bicategories", Midwest Category Seminar I); strength
of functors between categories on which a monoidal category acts were
considered by H. Lindner, in some papers/preprints in the late 70s,
and a summary is given in his "Enriched categories and enriched
modules", Cahiers Vol 22 (1981), 161-174. This paper also contains
several references.

-Aspects of tensorial strength has been developed by several
computer-science mathematicians later (starting with E. Moggi, I
believe); I do not know much about their work, so my answer to Jeff's
question may not be up to date.
