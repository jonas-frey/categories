FOURTH SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 4)

Chapman University, California, USA
      22-23 May, 2019

    http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/syco/4/

The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an
interdisciplinary series of meetings aiming to support the growing
community of researchers interested in the phenomenon of
compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives, and in
particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language.
The first SYCO was in September 2018, at the University of Birmingham.
The second SYCO was in December 2018, at the University of Strathclyde.
The third SYCO was in March 2019, at the University of Oxford. Each
meeting attracted about 70 participants.

The fourth SYCO will be in Chapman University, California, and we have
15 papers accepted for presentation, ranging over theory and practice
of category theory, from homotopy type theory to differential
programming, to rewriting systems, and to machine learning.

Indeed the SYCO series aims to bring together the communities behind
many previous successful events which have taken place over the last
decade, including "Categories, Logic and Physics", "Categories, Logic
and Physics (Scotland)", "Higher-Dimensional Rewriting and
Applications", "String Diagrams in Computation, Logic and Physics",
"Applied Category Theory", "Simons Workshop on Compositionality", and
the "Peripatetic Seminar in Sheaves and Logic".
