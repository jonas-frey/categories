Dear Neil,

(Sorry for the echoed mail: I forgot to scrub the html when sending to the list)

The discussion of cardinality reminds me of something that I had meant
to say earlier, but didn't quite find the words for.

It seems to me that in material set theory, the role of cardinality is
to give us an arithmetic--a way of computing with sets. This is a
response to the fact that sets  of material set theory are not (as you
point out) in any way algebraic objects. Essentially, cardinals give
us an arithmetic which respects bijection.

Cardinal arithmetic breaks down in a constructive setting: we need
choice to see that the cardinals are linearly ordered, and LEM to even
have them partially ordered. So, in constructive settings, cardinality
is simply not a well-behaved notion. However, I have never found
myself missing cardinals in type theory, and I spent a while wondering
why. The answer is that, in type theory (and also in structural set
theories) the objects are essentially algebraic objects, which means
we have a direct arithmetic of sets. We don't need to pass to a
surrogate arithmetic.

We can see this even with large-cardinal axioms, which are ultimately
not about cardinals, but about what sorts of objects exist in the
universe: an inaccessible tells us we have a (transitive, set-sized)
model of ZF; a Mahlo tells us (among many other things) that every set
is included in one. There's an order-theoretic way to express the
Mahlo condition on a cardinal (every monotone, continuous function on
the cardinal has a fixed point), and this in-turn allows us to relate
the notion to computational principles. In particular, see (e.g.)
Dybjer and Setzer's "Induction-recursion and initial Algebras" and
related work comparing induction-recursion to Mahlo cardinals.

The point of this (very sketchy) Mahlo example is that large cardinal
axioms tell us that certain sorts of arithmetical operations on
cardinals are well-defined. We can state such principles about the
objects of our theory directly if the objects are sufficiently
algebraic to begin with.

Best regards,
Cory
