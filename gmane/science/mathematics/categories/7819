Dear Eduardo,

Thank you for your clarifications.

The fact that you did not use the language of indexed categories or
fibrations in formulating your statement, and that you referred to =
specific
objects and epimorphic families involving the site CC, made me think =
that
you assumed CC to be a site in the standard sense, rather than a site
internal to SS, and hence I answered accordingly. My argument certainly =
does
not apply in the case of a site internal to SS; in this situation, one
should appropriately formalize the statement in the higher-order =
internal
logic of the topos in question (in which case, the resulting sentence
becomes valid in this logic) and use the machinery of indexed categories =
or
fibrations to 'externalize' it.

Concerning your last question, I would like to remark that, in general, =
if
one is able to interpret a statement M involving certain semantic =
notions or
constructions as the semantic interpretation of a syntactic statement S =
in a
system admitting a soundness theorem for such kind of interpretations, =
then,
if S can be established within the system by purely syntactic means, one =
can
rely on the soundness theorem to 'canonically' deduce M. Going through a
syntactic system to lift results from a given context (playing the role =
of a
'standard model' of the system that one keeps in mind when working in =
it) to
a more general one is a most effective (and conceptually satisfying) =
method,
as the history of our subject, as well as its most recent developments,
show. For instance, following the discovery of the internal language of =
a
topos, many categorical results about toposes have been established or
interpreted as semantic interpretations of syntactic statements provable =
in
the internal logic. In the case of Diaconescu's Theorem, the route which =
has
first been taken to establish it over a general base topos has not been =
that
of designing a 'syntactic' version of it, but rather that of developing
appropriate generalizations of the various notions involved in it within =
the
framework of indexed categories/fibrations. However, I think that it =
would
be feasible to develop a logical system for doing category theory over a
base topos; in this respect, the book "Relative Category Theory and
Geometric Morphisms: A Logical Approach" (Oxford Logic Guides) by J. =
Chapman
and F. Rowbottom might be relevant - its abstract reads as follows:=20

"Topos theory provides an important setting and language for much of
mathematical logic and set theory. It is well known that a typed =
language
can be given for a topos to be regarded as a category of sets. This =
enables
a fruitful interplay between category theory and set theory. However, =
one
stumbling block to a logical approach to topos theory has been the =
treatment
of geometric morphisms. This book presents a convenient and natural =
solution
to this problem by developing the notion of a frame relative to an
elementary topos. The authors show how this technique enables a logical
approach to be taken to topics such as category theory relative to a =
topos
and the relative Giraud theorem. The work is self-contained except that =
the
authors presuppose a familiarity with basic category theory and topos
theory. Logicians, set and category theorists, and computer scientist
working in the field will find this work essential reading."

Best regards,
Olivia  =20
