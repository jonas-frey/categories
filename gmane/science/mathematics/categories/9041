Dear Sergey,

For myself, I'm not exactly sure I understand the original notion of predica=
tivity, but I have a rule of thumb that seems to work and satisfy predicativ=
e mathematicians. I've frequently claimed that parts of my work are predicat=
ive, and no one has complained so far.

In topos theory, as you point out, the subobject classifier and powersets in=
dicate impredicativity.

My rule of thumb is that "geometric" reasoning, preserved (up to isomorphism=
) by the inverse image parts of geometric morphisms, is safely within the pr=
edicative fragment. (Note that even exponentials, function sets, are not geo=
metric, so geometric reasoning is quite restricted.)

The subobject classifier and powersets are not geometric.

On the other hand, the free semilattices, along with free algebras (for cart=
esian theories) in general, are geometric, and they classify Kuratowski fini=
te subobjects. My rule of thumb predicts that Kuratowski finite powersets ar=
e predicative, and there seems to be general agreement with that.

My current work on arithmetic universes seeks a setting for pure geometric r=
easoning, without the non-geometric parts that exist in toposes, and indepen=
dent of base topos so long as it has an nno.

Best wishes,

Steve Vickers.
