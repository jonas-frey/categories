Dear All,

There is a strong emphasis on cocartesian morphisms of groupoids  in the=20
various editions of `Topology and Groupoids' (but called there=20
`universal morphisms'), following Philip Higgins' paper  1964 paper on=20
groupoids. Philip's work on this idea was nicely jacked up by him to=20
induced morphisms of crossed modules, i.e. using the cofibration XMod=20
\to Group(oid)s giving the base group (or groupoid!), with a good=20
application to 2nd relative homotopy groups, and this appeared in our=20
papers. In higher dimensions, you get the Relative Hurewicz Theorem this=20
way.

One of the applications to groupoids I like is that the cocartesian=20
morphism from the groupoid I (indiscrete on 0,1) over the identification
{0,1} \to {0} gives I \to Z=3D integers. This seems a enough good reason=20
why the fundamental group of the circle is the integers!

Doing this for categories instead of groupoids gives of course `2' \to N=20
is cocartesian over the same identification, which thus gives another=20
formulation of induction!

In the new book `Nonabelian algebraic topology' (in final stages,=20
downloadable from my web page, and final comments welcome) we emphasise=20
the fibrations and cofibrations of categories approach.

Ross asks about the Beck-B=E9nabou-Roubaud-Chevalley condition: I would=20
like to know of applications to the matters considered in these two books=
!

Ronnie
