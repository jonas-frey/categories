The simplest example I can think of is posets. If you represent a
poset as a category (i.e. a category with at most one arrow from A->B
such that A->B and B->A implies A=B), then an object A is completely
determined by the set of arrows going in to it.

In this context, the Yoneda embedding is the familiar result that any
poset P embeds fully and faithfully in the powerset of P, ordered by
subset inclusion.
