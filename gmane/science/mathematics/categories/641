Hello!

I'm trying to learn category theory and understand its links to computer
science. One of my big questions is:

Is category theory a wonderful specification language, or is there any
executable stuff in it ?

All I've seen about application until now is specification or semantics
(which is already a lot!) but I wonder if anything else was ever done.
Thank you for any direct answer or any pointer to good texts about this.
