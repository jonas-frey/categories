Dear Marta, your msage does not contemplate the arXiv under the role I
gave it in my msage. For me, in that msage, the arXiv is only considered
as a meduim to broadcast your work. Only that.

I was not thinking at all as a way to establish priority

and so, you read the arXive to see if it is useful for your work. You
have to read the proofs to see if the statements are true. YOU are the
referee in a way.

Yes, so as to make any good in your curriculum, the higher the impact
factor (or ISI or whatever) the better. But it is completely IRRELEVANT
for those that will actually understand and use your work. !! .

As for the referee trouble, yes, I agree many times it is useful for
both ends.

This is also utopic. If I said I do not publish this paper in Annals of
mathematics, which I can perfectly do, by a matter of conscience, It is
clear that for nobody in any evaluation comitee (even by peers) this
declaration will have any value.

Depends for what? . When the matter is to make your work known, it is
even better than refereed journals.


Actually, I think the first reason and "raison d'etre" of the journals
at the time if their creation (19 th century or before) was the
diffusion of correct knowledge. Now it has degenerate in curriculum
build up. To diffusion of knowledge (right or wrong) we have the arXiv.
The interested reader is its own referee. What is the problem ?. To
utilize results (trusting a referee) without having taken the trouble to
verify and understand the proofs it is not a good way to do mathematics.
So, why care if the paper has been refereed or not ?
