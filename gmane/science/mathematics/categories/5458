Don't get me started.  Oops, too late.

Not following.  FinSet is an essentially small category, what do you
mean that it doesn't enjoy universal constructions?  It's even a topos.

Then there are the categories enriched in small categories, again
subject to cardinality restrictions, which too are perfectly capable of
enjoying universal constructions.

For small as opposed to essentially small categories, yes in some cases.
    But consider the category of ordinals truncated at say beth_2,
certainly a small category when the morphisms are the inequalities.  Are
you comfortable defining equality on the objects of this category?  (PTJ
would correctly accuse me of being inconsistent on this point.)

I hate to seem argumentative, Bob, but this can't possibly be the
difference between small and large.

> Small is beautiful, not evil.

Agreed, so long as this is not at the expense of large.  Nice to be able
to close on a note of consensus.  :)
