Dear Tom,

That's the wrong way to look at it. Category-land is really the land _betwee=
n_ the fortresses. The courage to enter Category-land is the courage to leav=
e the supposed protection of the city walls.

I was lucky enough to do my PhD in a region (Ringland) where they were alrea=
dy getting used to life without having those walls, but for for many of the c=
ity dwellers the idea that maths has anything to do with categories is as al=
ien as the idea that milk comes from cows.

Steve.
