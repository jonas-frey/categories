An old but still useful reference is Kock & Reyes' article in the Handbook of
Mathematical Logic (of course, for a mid-70's paper, it's a bit dated by
now!).  Phil Scott has written some more recent ones, including "Some
Aspects of Categories in Computer Science (Survey Article on Categorical
Logic)" and "Category Theory for Linear Logicians" (with R. Blute),
available on his website (he can provide the pub refs).
