Hi, everyone.

Sorry about all the emails yesterday.  I am now rested and can
properly formulate an email.

I am interested in linearly distributive categories with exponentials.
That is the right adjoint of tensor.

I was trying to find references on these, but was not successful.  =
Google
was not on my side. =20

However, I decided to visit Seely's webpage and found the following:

J. Cockett and R. Seely. Proof theory for full intuitionistic linear =
logc, bilinear logic, and mix categories. Theory and Applications of =
Categories, 3(5):85=96131, 1997.

The above paper covers what I need. =20

If anyone has any other references they recommend I would love to read =
them.

Thanks,
.\ Harley
