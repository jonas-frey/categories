Dear friends,

the usual kind of wiki is not suitable for collaborative science, but
recently there has been news of a special wiki for scientists which has
good support for references, keeps track of who said what, and has a
rating system. You can read more about it in Nature Genetics here

http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v40/n9/full/ng.f.217.html

and see it working here: http://www.wikigenes.org/

They even have movies for those who are too lazy to click:

http://www.wikigenes.org/app/info/movie.html

It looks however that they are not offering the software that runs the
whole thing.

The next Bourbaki, if there is going to be one, should not only advance
one particular kind of knowledge, but also show everyone that linearly
written text is not the only option.

My opinion is that we have not yet found the right way to do
"hive-science", but when we do, it will be a revolution. (A good start
would be to get out of the hold that the evil publishers have on us.)

Best regards,

Andrej
