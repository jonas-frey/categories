From: Carlos Simpson <carlos@picard.ups-tlse.fr>

Being a newcomer to the category list, I have a really naive and stupid question
(concerning H. Friedman's challenge). Namely, I was always under the impression
that you had to know what a set was before you could talk about what a
category was (in particular a topos). Is it possible to talk about toposes
without knowing what a set is?

This seems somewhat related to a question that has been bugging me for some
time, namely how to talk about a ``category''
which is enhanced over itself, but not necessarily having any functor to or
from Sets. The very first part of the structure would be a class of objects
O
together with a function (x,y)\mapsto H(x,y) from O\times O to O, but I
can't get beyond that.
