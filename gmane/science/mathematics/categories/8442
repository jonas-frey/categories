CALL FOR PAPERS

FM 2015 is the twentieth in a series of symposia organized by Formal
  Methods Europe, an independent association whose aim is to stimulate
  the use of, and research on, formal methods for software development.
  The symposia have been notably successful in bringing together innovators
  and practitioners in precise mathematical methods for software and systems
  development, industrial users, as well as researchers. The FM symposia
  welcome original papers on research and industrial experience,
  proposals for workshops and tutorials, entries for the exhibition of
  software tools and projects, and reports on ongoing doctoral work.

SCOPE AND TOPICS

FM 2015 will have the goal of highlighting the development and application
  of formal methods. This includes uses of formal methods in a variety
  of disciplines such as medicine, biology, human cognitive modeling,
  human automation interactions and aeronautics, among others. FM 2015
  particularly welcomes papers on techniques, tools and experiences
  in interdisciplinary frameworks, as well as on experience with practical
  applications of formal methods in industrial and research settings,
  empirical and experimental validation of tools and methods as well as
  construction and evolution of formal methods tools. The broad topics
  of interest for FM 2015 include but are not limited to:

Interdisciplinary formal methods: techniques, tools and
  experiences demonstrating formal methods in interdisciplinary
  frameworks.

Formal methods in practice: industrial applications of formal
  methods, experience with introducing formal methods in industry,
  tool usage reports, experiments with challenge problems.
  Authors are encouraged to explain how the use of formal methods has
  overcome problems, lead to improvements in design or provided
  new insights.

Tools for formal methods: advances in automated verification and
  model-checking, integration of tools, environments for formal
  methods, experimental validation of tools. Authors are encouraged
  to demonstrate empirically that the new tool or environment
  advances the state of the art.

Role of formal methods in software and systems engineering:
  development processes with formal methods, usage guidelines for
  formal methods, method integration. Authors are encouraged
  to evaluate process innovations with respect to qualitative or
  quantitative improvements. Empirical studies and evaluations
  are also solicited.

Theoretical foundations: all aspects of theory related to
  specification, verification, refinement, and static and dynamic
  analysis. Authors are encouraged to explain how their results
  contribute to the solution of practical problems with methods or
  tools.

PAPER SUBMISSION

Papers will be evaluated by at least three members of the Programme
  Committee. They should be in Springer LNCS format and describe, in
  English, original work that has not been published or submitted
  elsewhere.

Authors of papers reporting experimental work are strongly encouraged
  to make their experimental results available for use by reviewers.
  Similarly, case study papers should describe significant case studies
  and the complete development should be made available at the time of
  review. In other words, the usual criteria for novelty, reproducibility,
  correctness and the ability for others to build upon the described work
  apply.

Tool papers should explain enhancements made compared to previously
  published work. A tool paper need not present the theory behind the
  tool but can focus more on its features, and how it is used, evaluation,
  with screen shots and examples. Authors of tool papers should make
  their tool available for use by reviewers.


Papers should be submitted through the FM 2015 EasyChair web site:

   http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2015.

We solicit two categories of papers:

Regular Papers should not exceed 15 pages in LNCS format,
  not counting references.

Short papers, including tool papers, should not exceed 6 pages,
  not counting references. Besides tool papers, short papers
  are encouraged for any subject that can be described within
  the page limit, and in particular for novel ideas without an
  extensive experimental evaluation. Short papers will be accompanied
  by short presentations.

For regular and tool papers, an appendix can provide additional
  material such as details on proofs or experiments. The appendix
  is not guaranteed to be read or taken into account by the reviewers
  and it should not contain information necessary to the understanding
  and the evaluation of the presented work. Papers will be accepted
  or rejected in the category in which they were submitted, there
  will be no "demotions" from a regular to a short paper.


BEST PAPER AWARD

FM 2015 will as a new feature have a best paper award.
  A best paper will be selected among accepted papers,
  and the award will be presented at the conference.

PUBLICATION

Accepted papers will be published in the Symposium Proceedings, to
appear in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
