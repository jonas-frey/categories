I have to agree with Tom here because to deny this would offend those=20
upset by Holocaust deniers (which we all should be upset by).  This=20
comes up repeatedly in the politics of global warming, where people=20
complain on that basis about the use of the term "climate denier."

Sensitivity is chopping holes in the English language the way mad cow=20
disease chops holes in the brain, obliging us to replace "he" by "he or=20
she" (awkward) or "they" (ungrammatical), maintain an up-to-the-minute=20
lexicon of who's allowed to call which groups by what names, keep track=20
of which punishments are meted out to which groups for insulting which=20
icons, and so on.

I'm not saying sensitivity should or shouldn't do this, I'm just=20
pointing out that it's happening.  Nature does not judge BSE as good or=20
bad, however badly done by its victims might feel.

This might not be the best time to advertise my paper "Communes via=20
Yoneda, from an Elementary Perspective," Fundamenta Informaticae 123=20
(2010) 1=9616, DOI 10.3233/FI-2010-315, which (at long last) is the=20
journal version of my CT'04 talk in Vancouver.  That's because I speak=20
there about "the schizophrenic mind-body nature of Lewis's qualia" which=20
I explicate in terms of the dual nature of the elements of the dualizing=20
object and the states (functionals, open sets, dual points, intensive=20
quantities) of the tensor unit as the dual of the dualizing object in=20
*-autonomous categories, and the generalization thereof via profunctors=20
to commune categories.  The "schizophrenia" is analyzed in terms of the=20
two kinds of entities belonging to the same homsets.  All rubbish of=20
course, but hopefully to emerge from that status at some point.
