No constructivist (of whatever stripe) would be happy talking about
Q - (L U R), as in your second and third definitions, since he wouldn't
want to assume that L and R were complemented as subsets of Q.
Your first definition, if I understand it correctly, is equivalent to
what most toposophers would call the MacNeille reals -- that is, the
(Dedekind-MacNeille) order-completion of Q. If you "positivize" the
second and third (which would appear to be equivalent, for any sensible
notion of finiteness) by saying "Whenever p and q are rationals with
p < q, then either p \in L or q \in R", you get the Dedekind reals,
which are a proper subset of the MacNeille reals (though they
coincide iff De Morgan's law holds) but have rather better algebraic
properties.
