We have a proposed schedule of talks for the Octoberfest meeting next
weekend (4-5 Oct).  Please be aware that changes may still happen, and
a final schedule will be given out at the meeting itself.  An html
version of this document is available at the meeting website, and you
can check there for any last-minute changes, as we know them.

Some talks are still "TBA" - I hope the speakers will give me titles
asap!  We have some abstracts - those we have will be available on the
webpage (and I'll put others there as I get them).

In addition, I suggest folks review the instructions on the website re
location of the talks (at Concordia's Faubourg building), parking in
the area (the university has indoor parking from 9am - a bit of a
tight squeeze in terms of time, but possible - and there is metered
parking on the streets around the area), and do check the weather
(there are links to two weather sites on the webpage).
