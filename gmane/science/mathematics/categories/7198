8th SCANDINAVIAN LOGIC SYMPOSIUM 20-21 August 2012 at Roskilde University=
,
DENMARK

First Announcement and Call for Papers

The 8th Scandinavian Logic Symposium will be held at Roskilde University,
Trekroner, Denmark, 20-21 August 2012.

After a gap of fifteen years, the Scandinavian Logic Symposium is back.
The Symposium is the first major initiative of the newly revived
Scandinavian Logic Society (SLS, http://scandinavianlogic.org/) and will
be held at Roskilde University (RUC), Denmark.

As with previous editions of this conference, the aim of the programme is
to reflect current activity in logic in our part of the world. So we hope
that participants from Scandinavia, the Baltic countries and Northwestern
Russia will take the opportunity to contribute a talk and to meet with
fellow logicians from the area. But needless to say, we also extend a war=
m
welcome to logicians from further afield and plan to present a varied and
interesting collection of invited and contributed talks.

A post-SLS tutorial day will be organized on August 22

Also note that Advances in Modal Logic (AiML) will be held on 22-25 Augus=

science. Suitable topics include (but are not limited to) Proof Theory an=

LOCATION

Roskilde University (RUC) is situated at Trekroner, a small town 20
minutes by train from Central Copenhagen, and five minutes by train from
Roskilde.


ACCOMMODATION

Most people who work at RUC and almost all the RUC students live in
Copenhagen. Getting to RUC is an easy train journey from the centre of
Copenhagen. We anticipate that most conference attendees will book hotels
in central Copenhagen, where there are many hotels in many price ranges.
Hotel accommodation can also be found in Roskilde, though there the
options are more limited.
