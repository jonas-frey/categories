If a full and faithful functor between ccc's has a left adjoint which
preserves binary products, then it preserves exponentials (Elephant,
A1.5.9(ii)). In the absence of a left adjoint, the result is not true
in general: Set --> Sh(X) for X connected but not locally connected
gives a counterexample, as you suggest, and so does the inclusion
(continuous G-sets) --> (arbitrary G-sets) for a topological group G.
