We are pleased to announce the following event:

   SPRING SCHOOL ON QUANTUM STRUCTURES
   IN PHYSICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE

   * 19--22 May 2014, University of Oxford, UK
   * http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ss2014

This school will present a range of lectures on quantum structures in
physics and computer science, with a focus on abstract algebraic
techniques, including category theory. It is an ideal event for PhD
students, as well as more established researchers, who would like to
learn more about these exciting topics close to the research frontier.
The courses will be accessible to anyone who has taken a first course
in quantum information. Everyone is welcome to participate, and
registration information can be found on the school web page.

The school will feature the following courses:

   * Samson Abramsky, "Contextual semantics"
   * Jon Barrett, "Correlations and contexts: the quantum no-go theorems"
   * Bart Jacobs, "A categorical exposition of the duality between states and
effects in quantum foundations"
   * Prakash Panangaden, "Stone, Gelfand and Tannaka dualities"
   * Peter Selinger, "Number-theoretic methods in quantum information theory"
   * Aleks Kissinger and Bob Coecke, "Quantum picturalism"
   * Chris Heunen and Jamie Vicary, "Categorical quantum computing"

This event is twinned with a conference in honour of Prakash
Panangaden on the occasion of his 60th birthday, to be held on the
dates 23--25 May 2014 at the University of Oxford:

   * http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/pf2014

Please circulate this announcement to those who might be interested,
and use the poster available on the website to advertise this event in
your institution.

Best wishes,
Bob Coecke and Jamie Vicary
