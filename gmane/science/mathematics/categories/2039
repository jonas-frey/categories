This is in reply to Toby Bartels, quoted below.  I don't believe that those 
of us who have written about "ideas" in Ehresmann's sense ever conceived 
that each theory (sketch) was based on one right idea.  There is no 
"correct" idea for a given sketch.

I want to add, for those new to the subject, that the word "sketch" has 
been used with at least three meanings.  Ehresmann and his students use it 
for a structure which is a weakening of the concept of category (the 
composite may not be defined for all composable pairs) plus specified cones 
and/or cocones.  Many others have used the word sketch to refer to a 
category with specified cones and/or cocones.  Michael Barr and I in our 
two books used "sketch" to mean a graph with specified cones and/or cocones 
plus some commutativity conditions on paths; that is in the same spirit as 
Ehresmann's "idea".
