Dear All,

I've just posted a note on the arXiv, giving a short proof by counterexampl=
e=20
that the category of 3-computads is not cartesian closed.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0414

This result was first proved by Makkai and Zawadowski:

3-computads do not form a presheaf category. Journal of Pure and Applied=20
Algebra, 212(11):2543--3546, 2008.

Their original proof depended on some results on Artin glueing of Carboni a=
nd=20
Johnstone, and in turn some results of Day.  Recently Fran=E7ois M=E9tayer =
asked me=20
if I knew of a direct counterexample instead, that is, a 3-computad B such =
that=20
the functor _ x B does not have a right adjoint.

I did not know of anywhere that such a counterexample had been written up. =
  So=20
I constructed one, and after showing it to Fran=E7ois and others at Paris 7=
,=20
decided it might be useful to make the notes available.

The counterexample uses the same ideas as the proof of Makkai and Zawadowsk=
i=20
(essentially coming down to an Eckmann-Hilton argument) but the proof is=20
self-contained in this 8 page note, and the counterexample itself is given =
in=20
two pages in the middle.  I hope that this will help people further underst=
and=20
the very interesting and crucial result of Makkai and Zawadowski.

Comments are welcome.
Regards,
Eugenia
