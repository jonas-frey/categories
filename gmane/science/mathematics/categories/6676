This is a request for all those who will attend or may attend CT2011 to
send me email stating "may attend" or "will attend" on the subject line.
This information is needed so I can have a preliminary estimate of
attendance for the various events and excursions as well as making sure
the lecture room sizes are adequate. Since a preliminary participant list
will be drawn up soon it would be helpful to have your name, university or
city and country when you respond.

Those who have already registered do not need to reply.

Due to several requests the early registration deadline has been extended
to May 23.

John MacDonald

Information from an earlier announcement follows.

and the booking of accommodation is also available on site. Early booking
of accommodation is recommended as the University will not hold the block

Columbia in  Vancouver, Canada from Sunday, 17 July, through Saturday, 23
July 2011. It will begin with a reception at the Student Union Building
