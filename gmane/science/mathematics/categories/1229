                          CALL FOR PAPERS

                          FOSSACS 2000
     Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures
                 March 27-31, 2000, Berlin, Germany
	         http://fossacs.mimuw.edu.pl
	        Submision deadline: October 18, 1999


                          A member conference of 
    the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software 
                          (ETAPS 2000)

Conference decsription:

FOSSACS seeks papers which offer progress in foundational research
with a clear significance for software science. A central issue is
theories and methods which support the specification, transformation,
verification, and analysis of programs and software systems.

Topics covered are:

**    Computational and syntactic foundations of software science:
      computation processes over discrete and continuous data,
      techniques for their manipulation, and their algorithmic, 
      algebraic, and logical properties;

**   Transition systems, models of concurrency and reactive systems,
      and corresponding calculi, algebras, and logics;

**   Type theory, domain theory, and their connections to semantics
      of programming languages and software specification.

EATCS/EAPLS BEST PAPER AWARDS

There will be two awards for the best paper among all the papers presented
at any of the five main ETAPS conferences: EATCS award and EAPLS
award.
