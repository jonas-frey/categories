I=B4m pretty sure the objects (1)-(4) are isomorphic. Here=B4s a sketch o=
f the
proof:

Let X be the object (3), i.e. the initial object with a morphism 0:1---->=
X
and morphisms s:X---->X, t:X---->X with st=3Ds. Let Y be the object (2),
i.e. the initial object with a morphism 0:1---->Y and morphisms u:Y---->Y=
,
v:Y---->Y.

(1)&(2):
We clearly have maps 0 x 0: 1----> N^2, succ x 1_N and 1_N x succ :
N^2---->N^2, inducing the map Y---->N^2. For an element a of Y, we can
form maps f_{t,a}: N---->Y by 0 ]----> a, succ ]----> t, and f_{s,a} by
0 ]---->a, succ ]----> s. We can now form a map N x N ----> Y by
f(a,b)=3Df_{t,{f_{s,0}(a)}}(b). We can check that these maps form an
isomorphism.

(2)&(3):

Lemma: X is a monoid

We construct the addition X x X---->X by its exponential transpose
X---->X^X. This is the map induced by 1_X:1---->X^X, s^X:X^X---->X^X, and
t^X:X^X---->X^X.

We think of this monoid structure as ordinary ordinal addition.
We now construct morphisms s=B4 and t=B4 X---->X, given by s=B4(x)=3Dx + =
1 and
t=B4(x)=3D\omega + x. It is clear that s=B4 and t=B4 commute. This induce=
s a
morphism Y---->X.

On Y, we can create the projection map p:Y---->N as Y is isomorphic to N =
x
N. We also have the inclusion i : N ----> N x N given by a ]----> (a,0).
Now ipu and v satisfy ipuv=3Dipu (ipu is the map \_ + \omega. This induce=
s a
map X ----> Y, which will be the inverse of the map Y ----> X.

I will check the details later to make sure. But I would be very surprise=
d
if there were any problems.
