In this book we want to explore aspects of coherence in homological =20
algebra, that already appear in the classical situation of abelian =20
groups or abelian categories.

Lattices of subobjects are shown to play an important role in the =20
study of homological systems, from simple chain complexes to all the =20
structures that give rise to spectral sequences. A parallel role is =20
played by semigroups of endorelations.

These links rest on the fact that many such systems, but not all of =20
them, live in distributive sublattices of the modular lattices of =20
subobjects of the system.

The property of distributivity allows one to work with induced =20
morphisms in an automatically consistent way, as we prove in a =20
=91Coherence Theorem for homological algebra=92. (On the contrary, a =
=91non-=20
distributive=92 homological structure like the bifiltered chain complex =20=

can easily lead to inconsistency, if one explores the interaction of =20
its two spectral sequences farther than it is normally done.)

The same property of distributivity also permits representations of =20
homological structures by means of sets and lattices of subsets, =20
yielding a precise foundation for the heuristic tool of Zeeman =20
diagrams as universal models of spectral sequences.

We thus establish an effective method of working with spectral =20
sequences, called =91crossword chasing=92, that can often replace the =20=

usual complicated algebraic tools and be of much help to readers that =20=

want to apply spectral sequences in any field.
