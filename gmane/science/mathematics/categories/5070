Dear Andrej, when you say "complete" but not "chain-complete", do you
mean "directed complete"?

Here is (I think) an example that is also natural and relevant.

Do you know Andy Pitts' work (with others) on Nominal Sets? The
category of nominal sets is a sheaf topos (the "Schanuel topos", it
is actually Boolean). Andy has done some domain theory in nominal
sets to model a language with dynamic allocation of fresh names,
FreshML.

Fixing an infinite set of "atoms" A, then the category of nominal
sets is a subcategory of the category of actions of the symmetric
group on A (see reference for full definition). The set of atoms has
itself a natural group action. The finite powerset of the nominal set
of atoms, ordered by inclusion, is chain complete, but not directed
complete. Any chain of finite sets can only have finite support, and
is thus necessarily finite. But the full finite powerset is itself
directed, without an upper bound.

I hope that is of some help. Best regards, Sam.

Shinwell and A. M. Pitts, Theoretical Computer Science 342, 2005.
Available from Andy Pitts' web page. NB "nominal sets" are there
called "FM-sets".

The example I mention appears in Mark Shinwell's PhD thesis, The
Fresh Approach: functional programming with names and binders. http://
