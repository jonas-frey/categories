The following seems so obvious that I suspect it's not what Tom is
really asking for; but it seems to me to be an answer to his
question. A law in Tom's sense is just a parallel pair of arrows
F(X) \rightrightarrows F(1) in the algebraic theory T under
consideration (thinking of T as the dual of the category of
finitely-generated free algebras). To get the theory of algebras
satisfying a given set S of laws, you just need to construct the
product-respecting congruence on T generated by S (i.e., the usual
closure conditions for a congruence, plus the condition that
f ~ f' and g ~ g' imply f x g ~ f' x g'), and factor out by it.

Now any T-algebra A (in a category C, say) corresponds to a product-
preserving functor F: T --> C; and the set of laws satisfied by A
is just the (necessarily product-respecting) congruence generated
by F, i.e. the set of parallel pairs in T having the same image
under F. Is there anything more to it than that?
