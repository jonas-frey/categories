Dear Marta,

Here's my thinking on connected components.

For M, the paradigm example for how to get a point of MX (a cosheaf, or dist=
ribution) is to take locally connected space Y with map p: Y -> X, and then t=
o each sheaf U over X assign the set of connected components of p*U. This gi=
ves a covariant functor from SX to Set, and it preserves colimits. If X is a=
n ungeneralized space, then it suffices to do that for opens U, and the exte=
nsion to sheaves follows. Your theory of complete spreads shows that that pa=
radigm example is in fact general.

The extreme case of p is when X is itself locally connected and we can take p=
  to be the identity. The corresponding cosheaf is terminal in a strong sense=
: as global point of MX it provides a right adjoint to the map MX -> 1. The u=
nit of the adjunction provides a unique morphism from the generic cosheaf to=
  the terminal one.

If X is exponentiable, then (always? In favourable cases?) the cosheaf as de=
scribed above can be got by taking points for a map R^X -> R, where R is (fo=
llowing your notation) the object classifier. This points out Lawvere's anal=
ogy with integration, where R would be the real line. Then just as Riesz pic=
ks out the linear functionals as the distributions, we are interested in the=
  colimit-preserving ones.

In the above account, the role of local connectedness is to ensure that the c=
onnected components genuinely do form a set, a discrete space. What happens i=
f we look for a Stone space instead? Here is my conjecture.

1. For ungeneralized X we should be looking for a Stone space of connected c=
omponents of p*U for each _closed_ U. Y will need a suitable condition (stro=
ngly compact?) as analogue of local compactness. (By Stone duality that coul=
d also be expressed by assigning (covariantly) a Boolean algebra to each ope=
n.)

2. Noting that a closed embedding is fibrewise Stone, that assignment will e=
xtend to U an arbitrary fibrewise Stone (entire) bundle over X - that is to s=
ay, by Stone duality and contravariantly, a sheaf of Boolean algebras.

3. For generalized X that will provide our Stone notion of cosheaf. The assi=
gnment from entire bundles to Stone spaces should preserve finite colimits a=
nd cofiltered limits. There's an obvious technical hurdle of how to express t=
hat directly in terms of sheaves instead of entire bundles.

4. If X is exponentiable then this time, by Stone duality, we are looking fo=
r maps [BA]^X -> [BA] where [BA] is the classifier for Boolean algebras. The=
y must preserve filtered colimits (automatic for maps) and finite limits. NX=
  would exist for arbitrary X, and classify those maps.=20

Obviously there's lots to go wrong there, but do you think your coherent mon=
ad fits any of those points for coherent X?

By the way, although I haven't mention the effective lax descent and relativ=
ely tidy maps, I am interested in them. They are connected with stable compa=
ctness and Priestley duality.

All the best,

Steve.

   P_U on Loc_S is instead an instance of a" Pitts co-KZ-monad" and the resul=
