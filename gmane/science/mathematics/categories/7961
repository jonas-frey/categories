Fifth Workshop on
MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
12 April 2014, in Grenoble, France.
A satellite workshop of ETAPS 2014

http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/msfp2014/

The fifth workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming is
devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a
celebration
of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on programs as we
write
them today. Modern programming languages, and in particular functional
languages, support the direct expression of mathematical structures,
equipping
programmers with tools of remarkable power and abstraction. Where would
Haskell
be without monads? Functional reactive programming without temporal logic?
Call-by-push-value without adjunctions? The list goes on. This workshop is
a
forum for researchers who seek to reflect mathematical phenomena in data
and
control.

The first MSFP workshop was held in Kuressaare, Estonia, in July 2006,
affiliated with MPC 2006 and AMAST 2006. The second MSFP workshop was
held in Reykjavik, Iceland as part of ICALP 2008. The third MSFP
workshop was held in Baltimore, USA, as part of ICFP 2010. The fourth
workshop was held in Tallinn, Estonia, as part of ETAPS 2012.

Important Dates:

Submission:
===========

Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted
concurrently
to another conference with refereed proceedings. Accepted papers must be
presented at the workshop by one of the authors, and will be published
under
the auspices of EPTCS under a Creative Commons licence.

There is no specific page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.
