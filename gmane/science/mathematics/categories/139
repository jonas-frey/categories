Hi Jim,=20

perhaps you should do it for the catlist as the bill is a USA congress =
issue.=20

But as the email below says, I am urging its discussion here in the THES =
and by CASE (Campaign for Science & Engineering); and Steve Harnard =
thinks the response to the proposal has been too shrill!=20

It is a good thing to stir things up!=20

Ronnie

  Hi Ronnie,

  In the meantime these two links may be of interest:

  At least Larry Lessig appears to have stung Conyers into responding.


Hi Richard,


It would certainly be a good idea if THES did a critical article on the =
Conyers Bill's attempt to overturn the NIH self-archiving mandate.


But I think the letter you attached is a bit too shrill and not =
sufficiently well informed to hit the mark and help: "Any bets that the =
next step would be defunding arXiv?" The Conyers Bill is about not =
allowing NIH to require self-archiving. It has nothing to do with the =
spontaneous self-archiving that has been going on in Arxiv and elsewhere =
for nearly two decades.


Tim Farley's well-meaning piece in Discover Magazine's Bad Astronomy =
Blog is also too over the top to be taken seriously:


"Conyers wants science to be secret or you will pay." (Secret? Published =
journal articles, secret? Even if you have to pay to read them, what has =
that to do with being secret?)


"...pushing a bill through Congress that will literally ban the open =
access of these papers, forcing scientists to only publish in journals."


Ban open access? Forcing scientists to publish journal articles is =
journals?


This kind of scattershot rhetoric does not help any cause, only its =
detractors.


I've responded to both Larry Lessig's critique and John Conyer's reply, =
by the way.

  Hi Richard,

  Thanks.

  I just got the attached. It seems to need public discussion! E.g. in =
the THES? Can you initiate that?

  Are there any lengths to which these top publishers will not go to =
preserve their cosy domain, battening on the hard work of academics?

    Hi Ronnie,

    Thanks for these links. Yes, these are  the kind of issues that =

    Richard,

    As a result of listening to Laurie Taylor this afternoon I came =
across the following and perhaps they are relevant to your concerns.
