For what it's worth, I have seen such co-exponentials natually occur
in programming language semantics. They seem to occur in certain
extensions of lambda calculus. More specifically, in call-by-value
functional programming languages with call/cc style control
operators. When I say they occur "naturally", I mean that they exist
in such languages, not that they are typically used in any meaningful
way by programmers.

Very roughly speaking, in such languages, if A is a type, then (not A)
is the type of environments that can consume an element of type A and
then proceed with some task (called a "continuation" for A in
programming language lingo). A continuation for a function f : A -> B
is a pair of type A * (not B). In other words, an environment hoping
to interact with some function has to supply (1) an input to the
function, which is of type A, and (2) some task to complete after
receiving the output, i.e., something of type (not B).  It so happens
that in a call-by-value language with sufficient support for
continuations, there will be a one-to-one correspondence between
programs of type (A * not B) -> C and programs of type A -> B + C.

This is spelled out in long and very technical detail in my paper
"Control categories and duality" [1], sections 4.2 (definition of
co-control categories) and 7.3 (the call-by-value lambda-mu-calculus
is an internal language for co-control categories). The idea itself is
10 years older and is due to Andrzej Filinski [2], where
co-exponentials appear explicitly on p.33, second paragraph.
