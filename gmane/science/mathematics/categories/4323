Please accept my apologies for duplicate emails, as this announcement
has been sent to multiple mailing lists.

I would like to announce the following conference and a first call for papers.

ATMCS III
Algebraic Topological Methods in Computer Science
Paris, France 7-11 July 2008
http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~sanjeevi/atmcs/

***FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS***
Deadline for submission of abstract: 15 May 2008
Notification of acceptance: 5 June 2008
Deadline for registration: 15 June 2008
Conference: 7-11 July 2008
contact information: atmcs08@lix.polytechnique.fr

Recent research has shown that techniques from algebraic topology
adapt strikingly well in studying computational systems and other
subjects within Computer Science.  This third ATMCS conference hopes
to bring together researchers employing geometric/topological methods
in both abstract and concrete areas of computer science.  The week long
conference will feature some invited talks, several accepted talks, a
poster session, and countless opportunities for informal
collaboration; we plan to publish our proceedings in a refereed
journal, pending approval. All authors submitting an abstract by the
deadline will have an opportunity, at the least, to present a
(refereed) poster at the poster session.

***SCOPE***
Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, concurrency theory,
distributed computing and complexity, rewriting systems, image
analysis, and sensor networks.

***INVITED SPEAKERS***
A current (and incomplete) list of plenary speakers for the conference includes:

John Baez, University of California Riverside, U.S.A.
Gunnar Carlsson, Stanford University, U.S.A.
Herbert Edelsbrunner, Duke University, U.S.A.
Emmanuel Haucourt, CEA and Ecole Polytechnique, France
Rick Jardine, University of Western Ontario, Canada
Sanjeevi Krishnan, CEA and Ecole Polytechnique, France
Claudia Landi, University of Modena e Reggio Emilia, Italy
Francois Metayer, University of Paris 7 and CNRS, France
Konstantin Mischaikow, Rutgers University, U.S.A.
Gaucher Philippe, University of Paris 7 and CNRS, France
Francis Sergeraert, University of Grenoble 1, France

***INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSIONS***
Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts summarizing current
work that explores connections between algebraic topology and computer
science.  All abstracts should be written in English and should not
exceed 1 single-spaced page.  Although abstracts preferrably should be
sent by email to atmcs08@lix.polytechnique.fr, abstracts may also be
mailed to the postal address:

Sanjeevi Krishnan
DRT LIST DTSI SOL MEASI
CEA Saclay
