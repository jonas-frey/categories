In the expression "any x:T->X" the T depends on x.=A0 If you use the
arrow notation you seem bound to name the domain of the morphism.=A0 You
could say "for any x with codomain X there is an e:dom x -> X ..." but
in the rest of the sentence you will have to mention the domain again.

My impression is that notation "any x:T->X" where T depends on x
without that fact being mentioned is common in category theory
writing.=A0 There is nothing wrong with this if a reader understands the
intent.

I would call it "suppression of dependence".=A0 In the Handbook I talked
about suppression of parameters, but this is not suppression of
parameters.=A0 It is something I had not noticed before.   Are there
other situations in math where this happens?
