If I may stick my head over the parapet, I'd like to suggest that you're =
surely fighting a losing battle here. Wikipedia does not work by having =
articles written by "chosen groups of experts". Indeed, quite the =
opposite; some amateur with community spirit and a personal itch to =
scratch makes a start, others - perhaps more expert - chip in, and =
gradually the wonder that is Wikipedia blossoms. Or not, as the case may =
be: perhaps two amateurs with conflicting axes to grind hack away at =
each other's changes, and nothing productive comes of it; that's the =
price you pay for crowd-sourcing.

I believe that your only option is to do some of that chipping in =
yourself. You can obviously see many flaws in the original article that =
"Fotino" has kindly started; why not set about improving it? Who knows - =
others may follow your noble example!=20

But I recommend not to start by replacing the existing article with a =
blank slate; that's simply rude. If in doubt, start with the associated =
discussion page, which doesn't seem to have changed since Oct 2009. See =
the discussion under "Stub requests"; maybe talk personally with Charles =
Matthews.
