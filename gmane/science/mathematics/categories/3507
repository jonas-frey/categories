                   Static Analysis Symposium  SAS 2007
               22-24 August 2007, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark
                     (co-located with LOPSTR 2007)

Static Analysis is increasingly recognized as a fundamental tool for high
performance implementations and verification of programming languages and
systems. The series of Static Analysis Symposia has served as the primary
venue for presentation of theoretical, practical, and application advance=
s
in the area.

The technical programme for SAS 2007 will consist of invited lectures,
tutorials, panels, presentations of refereed papers, and software
demonstrations. Contributions are welcome on all aspects of Static Analys=
is,
including, but not limited to:

   abstract domain
   abstract interpretation
   abstract testing
   compiler optimisations
   control flow analysis
   data flow analysis
   model checking
   program specialization
   security analysis
   theoretical analysis frameworks
   type based analysis
   verification systems

Submissions can address any programming paradigm, including concurrent,
constraint, functional, imperative, logic and object-oriented programming.
Survey papers, that present some aspect of the above topics from a new
perspective, and application papers, that describe experience with
industrial applications, are also welcome. Papers must describe original
work, be written and presented in English, and must not substantially
overlap with papers that have been published, or that are simultaneously
submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed proceedings.

Submitted papers should be at most 15 pages formatted in LNCS style
excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices not intended for
publication). PC members are not required to read the appendices, and thu=
s
papers should be intelligible without them. The proceedings will be
ublished by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
series.
