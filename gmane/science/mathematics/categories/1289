RESEARCH POST IN THE DEPT. OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF MILAN

Applications are invited for a research post within
the framework of the "Principled Hybrid Systems:
Theory and Applications" (PHYSTA) research network.
The network is funded by the Training and Mobility of
Researchers programme (TMR) of the EC and has started
in December 1997. It involves research groups from five
universities:
  i) King's College London, United Kingdom
      (Dept. of Mathematics, Prof. J.Taylor)
 ii) Katholic University of Nijmegen, Netherlands
      (Centre for Neural Networks, Prof. Stan Gielen)
iii) National Technical University of Athens, Greece
      (Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering,
       Prof. Stefanos Kollias)
 iv) University of Milan, Italy
       (Department of Computer Science, Prof. Bruno Apolloni)
  v) Queen's University Belfast, United Kingdom
       (Dept. of Psychology/English, Prof. Rodie Cowie)

The aim of the research network is the development of
a theory and a methodology for combining symbolic and
sub-symbolic techniques. The problem domain which is
used comes from HCI and refers to emotion understanding
based on static/moving image and speech signals.

The research post is available in the Neural Networks
Laboratory of the Computer Science Department of the
University of Milan. The post is available immediately
for a period of 18 months.

The successful applicant will work for the continuation
of the development of a hybrid system prototype which
has been implemented. This is a system combining a neural processing
part which performs a mapping from the feature to the
propositional variables space and a symbolic processing part.
The latter is a series of meditation jumps to higher levels
of abstraction following a PAC learning framework for boolean
formulas.

Candidates must have (or be close to obtaining) a PhD in a field
such as Computer Science, Mathematics or Electrical Engineering.
C programming skills are necessary while experience using SNNS
and Scheme/Lisp programming skills are welcome.

As the funding is provided by the EC TMR programme there are some
restrictions on who may benefit from it:

   * Candidates must be 35 years old or younger.
   * Candidates must be nationals of a EU country, Norway, Switzerland
     or Iceland
   * Candidates must not be Italian nationals or have worked in Italy 18
     out of the last 24 months.

The salary for this post is approximately 2,100 Euros.
