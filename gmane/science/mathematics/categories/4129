I would like help on an expository point when using structures such as a =
tensor product in a practical situation, and where one does not want to =
overload the reader, and make things seem more complicated than =
necessary.=20

I accept the excellent example in CFTWM p.164 2nd edition that even for =
the cartesian product one cannot get a strict associativity isomorphism. =
However when dealing say with tensor product of modules over a =
commutative ring, one feels that the tensor product associativity is no =
less strict than the usual product of sets, because of the definition by =
the universal bilinear property, which extends to 3-fold tensor products =
and trilinearity. Has this feeling been clearly expressed in the =
literature?=20

Again, is there an exposition of say the tensor algebra of a vector =
space which adequately (in your view) takes account of coherence?=20

I am trying to finalise an account of tensor products of crossed =
complexes, a much more complicated situation, but where the same ideas =
arise.=20
