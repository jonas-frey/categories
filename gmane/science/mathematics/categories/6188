Yep; certainly now my original objection no longer applies.
Instead, I'm annoyed by the mealy-mouthed lack of content in
the new "disclaimer" (?),

| The illustrations on this page are derived from various different =

| parametrizations.

Shouldn't a Wikipedia article be *providing* =

(rather than suppressing) information?

Is it really informative to hide the fact that the color illustration
(at top) for the (3,7)-torus knot *is* using the parametrization that
the text displays, while the b/w (2,3)-torus knot (displayed next) is
using rather a *different* style of parametrization, whose details are
=2E.. well, you see what I'm after? And if I change it, who next will
change it away again?

Cheers, -- Fred
