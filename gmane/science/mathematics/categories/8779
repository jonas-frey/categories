The 2016 Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Com=
putation

Call for Nominations


Introduction

An annual award, called the Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributio=
ns to Logic and Computation, was established in 2015 by the ACM Special Int=
erest Group for Logic and Computation (SIGLOG), the European Association fo=
r Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), the European Association for Comput=
er Science Logic (EACSL), and the Kurt G=F6del Society (KGS). The award is =
for an outstanding contribution represented by a paper or by a small group =
of papers published within the past 25 years. This time span allows the las=
ting impact and depth of the contribution to have been established. The awa=
rd can be given to an individual, or to a group of individuals who have col=
laborated on the research. For the rules governing this award, see  http://=
siglog.hosting.acm.org/the-alonzo-church-award-for-outstanding-contribution=
s-to-logic-and-computation/


Eligibility and Nominations

The contribution must have appeared in a paper or papers published within t=
he past 25 years. Thus, for the 2016 award, the cut-off date is January 1, =
1991. When a paper has appeared in a conference and then in a journal, the =
date of the journal publication will determine the cut-off date. In additio=
n, the contribution must not yet have received recognition via a major awar=
d, such as the Turing Award, the Kanellakis Award, or the G=F6del Prize. (T=
he nominee(s) may have received such awards for other contributions.) While=
  the contribution can consist of conference or journal papers, journal pape=
rs will be given a preference.=20

Nominations for the 2016 award are now being solicited. The nominating lett=
er must summarize the contribution and make the case that it is fundamental=
  and outstanding. The nominating letter can have multiple co-signers. Self-=
nominations are excluded. Nominations must include: a proposed citation (up=
  to 25 words); a succinct (100-250 words) description of the contribution; =
and a detailed statement (not exceeding four pages) to justify the nominati=
on. Nominations may also be accompanied by supporting letters and other evi=
dence of worthiness.

Nominations are due by March 1, 2016, and should be submitted to vardi@cs.r=
ice.edu


Presentation of the Award

The 2016 award will be presented at LICS, the flagship conference of SIGLOG=
. The award will be accompanied by an invited lecture by the award winner, =
or by one of the award winners. The awardee(s) will receive a certificate a=
nd a cash prize of USD 2,000. If there are multiple awardees, this amount w=
ill be shared.=20


Award Committee=20

The 2016 Alonzo Church Award Committee consists of the following four membe=
rs: Catuscia Palamidessi, Gordon Plotkin, Wolfgang Thomas, and Moshe Vardi =
(chair).
