In reply to M. Barr's posting.

Richard Wood tells me that my posting on this subject, dated 2 =20
December 2005, was unreadable with 'elm' and nearly so with 'pine', =20
due to rich-text marks.
I am reposting it in plain text (hopefully), with a few small =20
additions - and apologies

I think that such squares should be called "exact" or =20
"semicartesian" (where cartesian square =3D pb, cocartesian =3D po).
They should be viewed as the natural self-dual generalisation of =20
pullback and pushout (and their name should be "self-dual", in some =20
way). They appear whenever one studies categories of relations.

1. In an abelian category (where they are chracterised by the exact =20
sequence you have mentioned), I would prefer "exact", or "Hilton-exact".
Hilton considered such squares (for abelian categories), and proved =20
that an equivalent condition is that this square (of proper =20
morphisms) is "bicommutative" in the category of relations (i.e. it =20
commutes and stays commutative when you reverse two "parallel" arrows =20=

- as relations).

Plainly:   bicartesian square  =3D>  pullback  =3D>  exact;  and dually.

REFERENCE:
P. Hilton, Correspondences and exact squares, in: Proc. Conf. on =20
Categorical Algebra, La Jolla 1965, Springer, pp. 254-271.

2. Studying more general categories of relations, I considered =20
"semicartesian squares"  (f,g, h,k),  defined - in any category - as =20
the commutative squares satisfying the following self-dual property:

  Whenever  (f',g', h,k)  and  (f,g, h',k')  commute, also the outer =20
square  (f',g', h',k')  commutes

                          B
         f'           f        h          h'
   A'          A                 D          D'
         g'          g        k          k'
                         C

(add slanting arrows  f': A' --> B,  g': A --> C,  f: A --> B,  etc).

- Again: bicartesian square  =3D>  pullback  =3D>  semicartesian,  and =20=

dually.

- If pb's  and/or  po's exist, there are a lot of equivalent =20
properties; eg:

--  (f,g)  and the pb of  (h,k)  have the same po (or the same =20
commutative squares out of them).

- In an abelian category, semicartesian amounts to the previous notion.
- In Set, it characterises again those squares which are =20
bicommutative in Rel.

3. A 2-dimensional version of this property (actually a STRUCTURE on =20
2-cells), was introduced by Guitart, and called "H-exact", if I =20
remember well (H for Hilton)
