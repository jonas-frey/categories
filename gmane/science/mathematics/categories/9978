It's an article that names the company Risk Group LLC (with John Baez as
co-founder).

The website of Risk Group has 'warfare' as the first menu item in the
menu row. Under other menus there is AI and such related things that
industry more in general is interested in. There are relations to health
care solutions etc, so the ambition is broad.

"Is it pure marketing?" I don't know about 'pure', but it looks like
marketing, at least partly, and why not? I for one wish Risk Group as a
company all the best. If category theory becomes more in focus in
applications serving the public and private sectors in general, also as
promoted by Risk Group LLC, this is fine.

Possible relations to military application I wouldn't personally
support, but that's my personal choice. I'm a European, and work e.g.
with health care aspects as related also to the European Commission.

All the best,

Patrik
