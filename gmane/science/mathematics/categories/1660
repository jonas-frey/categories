Dear Colleagues,
  Below is the first Announcement and Call for Papers for next
spring's conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming
Semantics. As the announcement indicates, MFPS 17 will take place at
Aarhus University in Aarhus, Denmark from May 24 to May 27, 2001. We
encourage submissions in areas traditionally represented at MFPS, and
in related areas as well. The deadline for submissions is January 5, 2001.
  Please pass this announcement on to those whom you think would have
an interest in participating. An announcement providing registration
details and more information about the program will be forthcoming
around February 15, 2001, when the list of accepted papers will be
posted. General information about MFPS can be found at
http://www.math.tulane.edu/mfps.html and information about MFPS 17 at
http://www.math.tulane.edu/mfps17.html If you have any questions about
the meeting, you can send email to mfps@math.tulane.edu.
  Best regards,
  Mike Mislove

	Announcement and Call for Papers
                  MFPS XVII

         Seventeenth Conference on the
          Mathematical Foundations of
             Programming Semantics

              Aarhus University
               Aarhus, Denmark
            May 24 - May 27, 2001

Partially Supported by BRICS and the US Office of Naval Research

The Seventeenth Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics will take place on the campus of Aarhus
University in Aarhus, Denmark from May 24 to May 27, 2001. The MFPS
conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic and
computer science which are related to the semantics of programming
languages. The series particularly has stressed providing a forum
where both mathematicians and computer scientists can meet and
exchange ideas about problems of common interest. We also encourage
participation by researchers in neighboring areas, since we strive to
maintain breadth in the scope of the series.

The invited speakers for MFPS 17 include:
          Olivier Danvy  (Aarhus)
            Neil Jones  (DIKU)
            Kim Larsen  (Aalborg)
       Prakash Panangaden  (McGill)
            Jan Rutten  (CWI)
           Glynn Winskel  (Cambridge)

In addition to the invited talks, there will be three special
sessions.  The first will honor Neil Jones for his contributions to
theoretical computer science; it is being organized by Olivier Danvy
and David Schmidt (Kansas State).

The second will be a special session on model-checking, and it is
being organized by Rance Cleaveland (Stony Brook) and Kim Larsen.

The final special session will be on security, and it is being
organized by Catherine Meadows (NRL).

The remainder of the program will consist of papers selected from
submissions we receive in response to this Call for Papers.

The Organizing Committee for MFPS consists of Stephen Brookes (CMU),
Michael Main (Colorado), Austin Melton (Kent State University),
Michael Mislove (Tulane) and David Schmidt (Kansas State).  The
Co-chairs for MFPS XVII are Olivier Danvy, Michael Mislove and David
Schmidt.

The Program Committee Co-chairs for the meeting are Stephen Brookes
and Michael Mislove. The Program Committee also includes:
   Lars Birkedal (ITU)
   Rance Cleaveland (Stony Brook)
   Marcelo Fiore (Sussex)
   Matthew Hennessy (Sussex)
   Alan Jeffrey (DePaul)
   Achim Jung (Birmingham)
   Gavin Lowe (Oxford)
   Catherine Meadows (NRL)
   Peter O'Hearn (Queen Mary and Westfield)
   Susan Older (Syracuse)
   Dusko Pavlovic (Kestrel Institute)
   Uday Reddy (Birmingham)
   Giuseppe Rosolini (Genoa)
   Davide Sangiorgi (Inria - Sophia Antipolis)
   Andre Scedrov (Penn)
Submissions must be extended abstracts of 12 pages or less. They
should be in the form either of a PostScript file that can print on
any PostScript printer, or a pdf file. In particular, submissions
should use the US letter size format, as opposed to the European A4
size.

Submissions can be sent by email to mfps@math.tulane.edu 
The Deadline for Submissions is January 5, 2001

Information about decisions will be available by February 15, 2001, at
which time a list of accepted papers will be posted.

As with MFPS XI, MFPS XIII and MFPS XV, the Proceedings of the
conference will be published as a volume of the Electronic Notes in
Theoretical Computer Science. For information about this series,
access the URL http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs.

General inquiries about MFPS XVII can be addressed to
mfps@math.tulane.edu.

In addition to supporting the conference overall, the support provided
by the Office of Naval Research makes funds available to help offset
expenses of graduate students. Women and minorities also are
encouraged to inquire about possible support to attend the meeting.

               Registration Information
Detailed information about registration and accommodations will be
available on February 15, 2001, when the list of papers accepted for
the meeting is posted.
