If you read the TAC instructions for authors, you will find that we
discourage the use of the graphics package unless absolutely necessary
because, for the time being, dvi is still our basic archive format and
graphics specials were not rendered properly by dvi viewers.  I recently
discovered that at least one dvi viewer does indeed render graphics
specials.  Namely the yap viewer that comes with miktex, a
windows-specific implementation of tex enters something called dvips mode
(meaning, I imagine, an on-the fly conversion to ps and then rendering
that).  To be more precise, miktex2.5 asks if you want dvips mode (why
wouldn't you?) and miktex2.7 enters it automatically.  (I don't know about
2.6).

As far as I know no Unix (or Linux) viewer does this.  Neither pdflatex
nor dvipdfm renders graphics specials correctly.  The only way I have been
able to get correct pdf files is to first use dvips to make a ps file and
then use ghostscript to convert to pdf.

Still, one can hope that these problems will disappear in some future
implementations and we may withdraw our objections to the use of the
graphics package.  At that point, our reluctance to use Paul Taylor's
diagrams will also disappear.  For the time being, however, we will
continue to recommend the use of xy-pic and, in particular, the diagxy
front end.
