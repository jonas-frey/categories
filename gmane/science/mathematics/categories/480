The 25th annual meeting  of  the European Association for  Theoretical
Computer    Science (EATCS) will  be  hosted  by the  Center for Basic
Research in  Computer Science (BRICS) at  Aalborg University.  Aalborg
is the fourth largest city in Denmark.

The Programme Committee   represents    both tracks of    the  journal
Theoretical Computer Science,  covering algorithms and formal methods.
If enough good papers are submitted,  there will be parallel sessions.
Papers presenting original   contributions in any area of  theoretical
computer   science  are being sought.    Topics include  (but  are not
limited to):

  computability, automata, formal languages, new computing paradigms,
  term rewriting, analysis and design of algorithms, computational
  geometry, computational complexity, symbolic and algebraic
  computation, cryptography and security, data types and data
  structures, theory of data bases and knowledge bases, semantics of
  programming languages, program specification and verification,
  foundations of functional and logic programming, parallel and
  distributed computation, theory of concurrency, theory of robotics,
  theory of logical design and layout.

Authors are invited to submit seven copies of an extended abstract not
exceeding  12  pages by January 14,   1998.   Electronic submission of
papers    is  solicited.     Instructions     can    be  found      at
http://www.cs.auc.dk/icalp98/submit.html.   In addition  we     invite
suggestions for workshops by December 1, 1997.  All correspondence to
