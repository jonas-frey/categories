Categorical,

From the deafening silence i take it that there is no treatment of these
sorts of structures in the topos-theoretic or other categorical literature.

The whole area is a very rich vein. On the one hand there is great practical
interest in providing a modular semantics for fresh variables and
alpha-equivalence and a whole cottage industry has grown up around it. (Jamie
Gabbay's homepage <http://www.gabbay.org.uk/> is a good place for links.) On
the other, 'atoms' of the type in Fraenkel-Mostowski set theory do not occur
in an effective nature. An infinite supply of entities with no internal
structure, but which support an equality test, takes up way too much room to
fit inside a computational device. So, finding a consistent way to keep all
the benefits of the FM substitution
methods<http://www.gabbay.org.uk/papers/stusun.pdf>as they apply to
alpha equivalence while staying in an effective theory is
of both practical and theoretical interest.

Further, the generalization provide lots of structure to explore. One avenue
of investigation has to do with what can be contained. i found the
construction when teaching my 12 year old daughter set theory. We were using
the pedagogical device of set as physical container. Unfortunately, the
axiom of extensionality introduces a decidedly non-physical twist to things
(not counting quantum mechanical intuitions about what is physical). The
example we hit first was the von Neumann encoding for 2

[| 2 |] = { [| 0 |], [| 1 |] } = { [| 0 |], { [| 0 |] } }

which puts the same set in two clearly different physical locations. My
daughter and i decided that what went into the physical containers were
little promisory notes that could be redeemed for actual things. In this
version of the construction you only get flat structures, a set never
contains a set. That left the problem of the language in which the promisory
notes were written. Why not use the language of containers?

   - Container ::= {c| Note* |c}             // BlackSet ::= {b| RedSet* |b}
   - Note ::= {n| Container* |n}             // RedSet ::= {r| BlackSet* |r}

This has lots and lots of fun questions regarding how to redeem notes for
containers. It turns out that by carefully controlling the computational
power of how things are redeemed you never get the Russell paradox. This
appears to be related to stratified set theories such as the NF (thanks for
the link Paul!), but the circular set up does not show up in the wikipedia
article.

Another avenue of investigation is the number and kinds of color as there is
nothing that requires only two colors. In the spirit of the notation below,
we can think of a whole collection of different colored set theories
arranged by

Set(i) ::= {i| ( \Sigma_{ j != i } Set(j) )* |i}

This has interest for generic programming community. Find
here<http://paste.pocoo.org/show/109929/>Haskell code that resulted in
a conversation i had with Bruno Oliveira
regarding using generic programming techniques to take advantage of cyclic
symmetry in the different set theories.
