Actually, what I find intriguing is that it is the definition of=20
enriched category which seems to have priority over the definition
of internal category.  There are, I suppose, historical reasons for=20
this (pre-1960 the focus tended to be on AbGp-enriched categories)
---but I think it fair to say that (for as long as I can remember,=20
which obviously isn't that long from a "historical" perspective)
the majority of category theorists tend to adopt the internal=20
category style of definition (of category) as more primitive. =20

The issue at stake may seem minor: do we think of a class of arrows=20
(which can later be partitioned into homsets), or do we think of the=20
homsets first (and take their disjoint union later)?  But perhaps=20
the fact that one group of people prefers one approach and everyone
else the other is symptomatic of a psychological divide?=20

It's also worth noting, perhaps, how flukey it is that in the case=20
V=3DSet, V-internal and small V-enriched categories happen to coincide.
Consider V=3DCat, for example.  Or, note how different the requirements=20
on V are, for V-internal and V-enriched categories to be defined.=20

It is true that one would expect set-theoretic conservatives to deal with
small categories (~internal categories in the case V=3DSet), and more fle=
xible
mathematicians to use arbitrary large categories (~internal categories, w=
here=20
V is a category of "large sets", or classes).  This only re-inforces the=20
points made above.

Cheers,
