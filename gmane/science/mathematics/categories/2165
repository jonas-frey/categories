Scope:
------
The rule-based programming paradigm is characterized by the repeated,
localized transformation of a shared data object such as a term,
graph, proof, or constraint store. The transformations are described
by rules which separate the description of the sub-object to be
replaced (the pattern) from the calculation of the
replacement. Optionally, rules can have further conditions that
restrict their applicability. The transformations are controlled by
explicit or implicit strategies.

The basic concepts of rule-based programming appear throughout
computer science, from theoretical foundations to practical
implementations. Term rewriting is used in semantics in order to
describe the meaning of programming languages, as well as in the
implementation of program transformation systems. It is used
implicitly or explicitly to perform computations, e.g., in
Mathematica, OBJ, or ELAN, or to perform deductions, e.g., by using
inference rules to describe or implement a logic, theorem prover or
constraint solver. Extreme examples of rule-based programming include
the mail system in Unix which uses rules in order to rewrite mail
addresses to canonical forms, or the transition rules used in model
checkers.

Rule-based programming is currently experiencing a renewed period of
growth with the emergence of new concepts and systems that allow a
better understanding and better usability. On the theoretical side,
after the in-depth study of rewriting concepts during the eighties,
the nineties saw the emergence of the general concepts of rewriting
logic and of the rewriting calculus. On the practical side, new
languages such as ASM, ASF+SDF, BURG, Claire, ELAN, Maude, and
Stratego, new systems such as LRR and commercial products such as Ilog
Rules and Eclipse have shown that rules are a useful programming
tool.

The practical application of rule-based programming prompts research
into the algorithmic complexity and optimization of rule-based
programs as well as into the expressivity, semantics and
implementation of rules-based languages.

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the
various communities working on rule-based programming to foster
fertilisation between theory and practice, as well as to favour the
growth of this programming paradigm.

We solicit original papers on all topics of rule-based programming,
including but not restricted to

    * Languages for rule-based programming
          o Expressivity
          o Semantics
          o Implementation techniques
    * Applications of rule-based programming
          o Analysis of rule-based programs
          o Programming methods
    * Environments for rule-based programming
          o (Partial) Evaluation
          o Abstract machines for rewriting
    * Combination of rule-based programming with other paradigms
    * System descriptions


Submission procedure and publication:
-------------------------------------
      Submission process will be open in April 2003. Papers (of at
      most 15 pages) should be submitted electronically as PostScript
      or PDF files to one of the program committee chairs: Jean-Louis
      Giavitto (giavitto@lami.univ-evry.fr) or Pierre-Etienne Moreau
      (Pierre-Etienne.Moreau@loria.fr). The message should also
      contain a text-only abstract and author information.

      Accepted papers will be published and available during the
      workshop. After revision, final copies of the accepted papers
      will be published in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer
      Science (ENTCS), Elsevier Science. This will be confirmed in the
      second call for papers.
