Dear David

I'll assume by the coslice DOF_{C/} you mean the category whose objects are d=
iscrete opfibrations C --> D, and whose arrows are strictly commuting triang=
les under C.

In that case the answer to your question is no. When C is empty, DOF_{C/} is=
  just your category DOF, of small categories and discrete opfibrations betwe=
en them, and DOF lacks a terminal object. For suppose that D is terminal in D=
OF. Then for any set X, there is a discrete opfibration I(X) --> D, where I(=
X) is the category obtained from X by freely adding an initial object. That i=
s, the objects of I(X) are the elements of X together with one additional ob=
ject 0, and one has a unique arrow 0 --> x for all x in X.

If F:I(X) --> D is a discrete opfibration, then F(0) is an object of D such t=
hat the cardinality of the set of all arrows with source F(0) is that of X. T=
hus since D is terminal in DOF, for any set X there is an object x of D such=
  that the cardinality of the set of all arrows with source x is that of X. T=
his contradicts the smallness of D.

With best regards,

Mark Weber
