Various people (including Moerdijk & Palmgren, Hyland & Gambino,
Abbott & Altenkirch & Ghani) have considered locally cartesian closed
pretoposes with W-types, ie initial algebras for generalized
polynomial functors, aka 'containers'. (These W-types are an
appropriate analysis of the fixed points of intensional constructions
and so these categories have been motivated as "constructive toposes",
as models of a particular version of Martin-Lof's type theory).

Lcc pretoposes are Heyting pretoposes. For any object X, consider
those monotone endofunctions on the class Sub(X) that can be
constructed from the pullback functors and their left and right
adjoints. By my calculations, in a topos, these monotone endofunctions
have least and greatest fixed points (by internalizing them and then
using Tarski's fixed point theorem).

It seems that, in general, these monotone endofunctions will not have
least or greatest fixed points in lcc pretoposes with W-types. (I
haven't proved this, though, and perhaps I have missed a neat trick.)

If I'm not mistaken, this is a mismatch. Lcc pretoposes let you work
both intensionally and extensionally, yet when it comes to W-types, we
only consider the intensional constructions. Is there a reason for
this?-- are these fixed points "non-constructive" or "impredicative"
in some sense?

Has anybody thought about these things before? Have I missed
something? All the best, Sam


[My example is bisimilarity for transition systems, as studied in
concurrency theory. This is conventionally calculated as a maximum
fixed point for a monotone endofunction on the lattice of binary
relations. I can define a 'constructive' version of bisimilarity using
W-types, and then take the image. This differs from the usual notion,
unless choice is assumed.]
