Dear colleagues,

I invite applications for one postdoctoral position, starting
September 1 or as soon as possible, at Dalhousie University under my
supervision.

The successful applicant will be part of a government-funded research
team spanning Dalhousie and several U.S. institutions.  The overall
goal of the project is "to design a quantum programming environment,
and to accurately estimate and significantly reduce the computational
resources required to implement quantum algorithms on a realistic
quantum computer". Here at Dalhousie University, we will be primarily
responsible for the design of a quantum programming language.  The
project is structured as a research contract with specific milestones
and deadlines. The nominal start date for this project is August 1,
2011 (yes, this is in the past).

Familiarity with the design of programming languages, type systems,
and/or semantics will be a prerequisite for this postdoc. Familiarity
with quantum computing will be helpful, but is neither necessary nor
sufficient for this position - the main emphasis is on programming
languages.

The position is initially for 1 year, and can be extended for a second
year. The salary is CAD $50,000 per year.

Interested applicants should contact Peter Selinger at
selinger@mathstat.dal.ca as soon as possible, and in any case before
August 11. I can provide more details about the research project to
interested applicants on request.

Thanks, -- Peter
