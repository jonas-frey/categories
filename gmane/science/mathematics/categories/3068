Dear George,

   Concerning undirected graphs, the Boolean algebra classifier, and
the intermediate sub-topos that suffices for groupoids:

   The special feature of these toposes I wanted to emphasize is not that
some of them can be generated by monoids, but rather (whether one splits
idempotents or not) that the site of operators is itself a full
subcategory of the category of sets. This is a small part of the point
that Vaughn wanted to make, I believe. Having the direct visualization of
this system of operators available as merely maps between certain small
sets is a useful auxiliary to formal presentations of the d,s kind.
As you mention, a basic way in which such presheaves can arise is by
applying a non-exact functor F to a group; the fact that the exponents on
the group are just these ordinary sets explains why we obtain an object
in this sort of topos (which can serve as a presentation of another group,
if desired).

   As noted in my unpublished (but widely distributed) paper on toposes
generated by codiscrete objects, the Yoneda embedding in these cases
produces of course a full sub-category of a topos, one which looks
exactly like (a piece of) the category of sets; of course this is not
the discrete inclusion, but its dialectical opposite, the codiscrete one.
