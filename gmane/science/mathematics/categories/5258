The remarks of Clemens together with Murray Adelman's
construction as alluded to by Ross suggest the following.

The 1960 triumph of abelian categories was followed by a
decade  which Barr and Grothendieck showed that exactness=20
has little to to with additivity. But homology itself would seem also to
have little to do with additivity, if we take seriously the following defin=
ition
(that is actually mentioned in passing in many books without the
specific mention of that other 50-year old triumph of category theory).

Given a full inclusion that has both left and right adjoints, there is=20
a resulting map from the right adjoint to the left; the image H of that=20
map is a further invariant of objects in the bigger category, recorded in =
=20
the smaller.=20

For example  A^C will have a full subcategory determined by
a given surjective functor C->D so if A is complete the two adjoints and=20
the image exist (in the traditional example, let C be a generic sequence=20
and let D be the sequence of zeroes; restricting to the part of A^C where=
=20
d^2=3D0 may make computing H easier but will not change the definition).

Of course if the left adjoint preserves products, then so will H and
hence H will preserve any kind of algebraic structure.  But the simplest ex=
ample
(reflexive graphs) also satisfies the "Nullstellensatz " of my 2007 TAC pap=
er
on cohesion, which is just a way of saying that H reduces to the right adjo=
int
 itself.

For (nonreflexive) iterated graphs , I.e., for  C a sequence of parallel pa=
irs,
(for example sums of front vs back faces of cubes), an interesting subcateg=
ory
of the functor category is the part where the two are equal. This may be us=
eful
for homology of additive objects where rigs of coefficients are not necessa=
rily
rings.

How can exactness and "long exact sequences" be meaningfully  treated for s=
uch
functors H in non-abelian contexts ?
