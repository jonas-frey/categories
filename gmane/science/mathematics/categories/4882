That'll teach me to hit Send without proofreading.  I should add that the
copies of Diagrammes at CWRU should be available via interlibrary loan, but
not over the web.
Charles Wells, reakky, Wells.

[Note from moderator: Charles - readers won't get your remark because I
changed the Wekks you sent to Wells in the posting, but I like your
response, and your point is very well well taken. I'll repeat it and add
two other current items for readers:

*proofread posts before sending*

*do not endlessly quote previous posts in your replies (they are deleted
before posting)*

*DO NOT, yup I'm shouting, send attachments, html or other garbage - it
takes time to delete, and offending posts are randomly discarded.
Categories is a _text_ list*

These points, several others, and other information are on the list page:

but no one has read this far, have you?
