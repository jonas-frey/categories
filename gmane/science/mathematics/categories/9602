IMPORTANT DEADLINES:

*** April 30 *** - early registration deadline
*** April 30 *** - to apply for student travel support

                                 * * *

The 15th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic
(QPL 2018) will take place at Dalhousie University June 3-7, 2018.

The conference brings together researchers working on mathematical
foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and related areas,
with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical tools,
ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages,
semantical methods, and other computer science techniques applied to
the study of physical behaviour in general. Work that applies
structures and methods inspired by quantum theory to other fields
(including computer science) is also welcome.

QPL 2018 will be co-located with the 34th Conference on the
Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS 2018), which
takes place from June 6-9.
