                       CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

    21st International Conference on Types for Proofs and Programs,
                             TYPES 2015
                  Tallinn, Estonia,  18-21 May 2015

                      http://cs.ioc.ee/types15/

Background

The TYPES meetings are a forum to present new and on-going work in all
aspects of type theory and its applications, especially in formalized
and computer assisted reasoning and computer programming. The meetings
from 1990 to 2008 were annual workshops of a sequence of five EU
funded networking projects. Since 2009, TYPES has been run as an
independent conference series. Previous TYPES meetings were held in
Antibes (1990), Edinburgh (1991), B=C3=A5stad (1992), Nijmegen (1993),
B=C3=A5stad (1994), Torino (1995), Aussois (1996), Kloster Irsee (1998),
L=C3=B6keberg (1999), Durham (2000), Berg en Dal near Nijmegen (2002),
Torino (2003), Jouy en Josas near Paris (2004), Nottingham (2006),
Cividale del Friuli (2007), Torino (2008), Aussois (2009), Warsaw
(2010), Bergen (2011), Toulouse (2013), Paris (2014).

The TYPES areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

     foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics;
     applications of type theory;
     dependently typed programming;
     industrial uses of type theory technology;
     meta-theoretic studies of type systems;
     proof assistants and proof technology;
     automation in computer-assisted reasoning;
     links between type theory and functional programming;
     formalizing mathematics using type theory.

We encourage talks proposing new ways of applying type theory.


Invited speakers

Gilles Barthe (IMDEA Software)
Andrej Bauer (University of Ljubljana)
Peter Selinger (Dalhousie University)


Tutorials

Joachim Kock (Universitat Aut=C3=B2noma de Barcelona)
Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine (Stockholm University)=20


Contributed talks

We solicit contributed talks. Selection of those will be based on
extended abstracts/short papers of 2 pp formatted with
easychair.cls. Submission is via EasyChair by 20 March 2015. The
authors will be notified of acceptance/rejection by 10 April 2015.

Camera-ready versions of the accepted contributions, due by 1 May
2015, will be published in an informal book of abstracts for
distribution at the workshop.


Post-proceedings

Similarly to TYPES 2011, 2013, 2014, we will publish a
post-proceedings in the Leibniz International Proceedings in
Informatics (LIPIcs) series. Submission to that volume will be open
for everyone. Tentative submission deadline: mid-September 2015.
