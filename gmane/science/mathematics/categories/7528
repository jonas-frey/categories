Dear colleagues,

with a closing date of 31 January. (This is local time: somewhat ahead
of most of the rest of the world.)

The ad asks for someone whose research interests are closely related to=20=

the current strengths of the department. This explicitly includes =
category theory.

The position title is "lecturer", which roughly corresponds to the level
of assistant professor in the US.

The ad also lists essential and desirable criteria. Applications=20

be more likely to be successful.

Steve Lack.=
