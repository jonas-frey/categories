                     CALL FOR PAPERS
                Logic Journal of the IGPL
              Special issue on Hybrid Logic
         DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS: 31st May 2009
***************************************************************

Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic allowing direct reference
to worlds/times/states. It is easy to justify interest in hybrid
logic on the grounds of applications, as the additional expressive
power is very useful.  In addition, hybrid-logical machinery
improves the behaviour of the underlying modal formalism.  For
example, it becomes considerably simpler to formulate modal proof
systems, and one can prove completeness and interpolation results
of a generality that is not available in orthodox modal logic.
But more generally, the topic of this special issue is not only
standard hybrid-logical machinery (like nominals, satisfaction
operators, binders, etc.) but also extensions of modal logic that
increase its expressive power in one way or other.

For more general background on hybrid logic, and many of the key
papers, see the Hybrid Logics homepage (http://hylo.loria.fr/).

The special issue will welcome papers in a wide range
of topics, including description logic, feature logic, applied
modal logics, temporal logic, and labelled deduction.

We welcome both theoretical work and work describing systems and
applications on hybrid logics, broadly conceived.

All submissions will be peer reviewed with respect to the usual
journal criteria. Authors are invited to submit original,
previously unpublished, research papers written in English.

SUBMISSION DETAILS:

Papers should not exceed 25 pages including references. Authors
are required to prepare their submissions in latex, using the
style available at http://hylo.loria.fr/content/SI/2009

Submissions should be sent as .pdf files to
