Dear Colleagues:

I have been studying the "conversion" from x/y to 1 - x + y and the =
conversion from x/y to x + y - xy, where x and y are elements of any =
category (although in practice I have been restricting attention to =
probability-statistics (x =3D Pr(A), y =3D Pr(AB) where AB is the =
intersection of sets/events A and B) and (fuzzy) multivalued logics such =
as Goguen/Product (G) and Lukaciewicz (L) and Godel (Go)  (in the case =
of G, x/y is the non-trivial implication x --> y and in the case of L, 1 =
- x + y is the non-trivial implication x --> y) and the Jacobson radical =
in ring theory (which is based on the circle composition product x*y =3D =
x + y - xy for x and y elements of the ring) and Fermat's Last Theorem =
in number theory (x and y are integers and a super-super short proof =
seems to depend on generalizing x*y to n dimensions and using the =
conjugate which will be described below).  The conjugate ^ of 1 - x + y =
is (1 - x + y)^ =3D 1 + x - y, and the conjugate of x + y - xy is x + y =
+ xy.    An n dimensional generalization would involve x^^n + y^^n  =
where ^^ is exponentiation (unrelated to ^) since the product of 1 - x + =
y and its conjugate can be shown to involve x^^2 + y^^2 - x^^2 y^^2 =3D =
x^^2 * y^^2 and so on.  The expression "conversion" is used above =
instead of function because y/x --> 1 - x + y is not a function but a =
conversion of the division operation (for x non-zero) to subtraction and =
the addition of 1.    =20

The probability-statistics reader may recognize x/y and (Bayesian) =
conditional probability (BCP for short) written Pr(B/A) for Pr(A) =
non-zero, and it turns out that 1 - x + y for probability-statistics is =
Pr(A-->B) =3D Pr(A' U B) =3D Pr(A' ) + Pr(B) - Pr(A' B) =3D Pr(A' ) + =
Pr(AB) =3D 1 - Pr(A) + P(AB), which latter expression is maximized for =
very rare events and lower dimensional events when probability =
distributions are continuous on a volume of space containing A and B =
(Pr(A) =3D 0 for those cases) and also when A is a subset of B.  =
Pr(A-->B) is abbreviated LBP for logic-based probability, which I have =
been developing since 1980.   BCP applies to frequent/common and =
independent-like or low influence events (including Markov processes =
which have many similarities to independent events although they are =
"slightly" dependent) and LBP applies to rare events or rare-like events =
(Pr(A) less than epsilon for epsilon small positive) and to n-k =
dimensional subset events of n-dimensional Euclidean space for k =3D 0 =
to n and to highly dependent or highly one or two-way influencing =
events.=20

As for Goguen/Product logic (G) and Lukaciewicz logic, their union or =
"join" G U L, similarly to the union or join of either of them with =
Godel logic G, equals BL2, the basic (fuzzy) multi-valued logic which =
generalizes Boolean logic with the deduction Theorem and the plausible =
axiom p V ~p (p or ~p) for each proposition p.   Thus, G and L =
constitute all of the universe of logic in this sense, and they =
partition it into disjoint "roughly equal" parts.
