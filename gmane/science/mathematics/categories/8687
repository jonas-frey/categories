The 'coaffine envelope' construction of [HT12, Cor 2.12] provides the
free coaffine category 'D' over a symmetric one D (wrt strong symmetric
functors). So combining this construction with Symm, one gets

Coaff(C) = 'Symm(C)'

The explicit construction in ibid does not spell out this special case,
except for C =1, where one gets the familiar category of finite sets and
injections (with sum as tensor). The general description yields

Coaff(C) ( X, Y) = [ \Coprod_{W\in Symm(C)} Symm(C)(X \tensor W, Y)]_~

that is, morphisms f:X \tensor W -> Y, indexed by W, subject to an
equivalence relation via directed paths. It reduces to the explicit
description of Coaff(C) above by noting that every equivalence class has
a unique underlying injection i:|X| -> |Y| between the underlying index
sets, which gives a canonical representative of ~-classes with W = (|W|,
{Y_w}_{w\in |W|}) where |W| is the complement of the image of i in |Y|.

As for Symm(C), I am not positive about the original reference, but
surely it is worthwhile referring to the classical [JS93] which gives an
explicit description of the free braided monoidal category on a given
category (Prop. 2.2(b) and Cor. 2.4). One easily gets Symm(C) by
restricting to braidings which are symmetries (so the construction
involves permutation groups rather braid groups). The general
construction (a Grothendieck construction) is introduced in Kelly's
theory of clubs [K74]. The general theory that encompasses these monadic
constructions is that of *polynomial monads*, as in the recent [W15]
(and references therein for this rich theory), which includes the
construction of Symm among the many examples.
