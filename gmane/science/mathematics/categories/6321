From April 2011 onwards there will be free an assistant's position
("wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter") for doing PhD or Habilitation. The
duration is up to 5 years. In the second case it's not simply a postdoc
position since one is expected to finish a habilitation thesis.

Possible candidates should work in an area which I feel competent to supervise.
The position is not part of a project and thus the orientation of reasearch is
not too restricted. Typical examples would be categorical logic, type theory
and its relations to homotopy, constructive set theory, classical realizability
etc.

The job involves teaching exercise classes and correction of exams. It's not
strictly necessary to know German in advance (though it would be most welcome).
That means the first term(s) teaching can be done in English. But the
candidate should be willing to learn German rather quickly.

Although there will be a more formal application procedure people interested
should first contact me personally.
