Dear Colleagues,

SPbSU once again announces well-paid TCS and math positions in their new 
program. Don't miss this possibility to teach exceptionally bright and 
very motivated students! The deadline is January 30.

These positions are open for English speakers.

Apologies for multiple postings.

Best regards,

Eight Positions in St.Petersburg

The St.Petersburg State University opens eight full-time
positions of various level (see below) for advanced
teaching within the new Mathematics and Theoretical
Computer Science program. The Scientific Council of this
program is headed by Stanislav Smirnov.

This time positions are available for teaching in English,
and the knowledge of Russian is optional.

1. Professor, salary level 217 412 RUB per month (2 Position)
2. Associate Professors (Docents), salary level 190 235 RUB per month (2 Positions)
3. Associate Professors (Docents), salary level 163 059 RUB per month (4 Positions)

(We encourage to apply to _all_ appropriate positions,
because the formal applications are processed separately.)

The undergraduate program is very selective, admission is limited to
55 top students per year, the first four enrollments
(2015, 2016, 2017, 2018) are first rate. In particular,
more winners of the all-Russian mathematical Olympiad
joined our program than any other similar program
in Russia.

In addition, a graduate (master's) program is starting
in 2019, open both to Russian and foreign students.
Graduate courses are taught in English.

The program is accomplished in close cooperation with
Chebyshev Laboratory (http://chebyshev.spbu.ru/en/)

Applicants are expected to have a strong research record
and to be able to teach in English.
The winners are expected to carry out research of high professional
standard, to teach, as well as to perform customary administrative duties
such as advising students, participating in committees,
organizing admissions, etc. The teaching load is up to
6 academic hours (=4.5 astronimic hours) per week for full
professors, and 8 academic hours (= 6 astronomic hours)
for associate and assistant professors.

Initial contract is normally signed for a period of up
to five years, and can be renewed by further 5 year terms.

The details of the formal application procedure can be
found at

http://hr.spbu.ru/konkursy-na-zameshchenie-dolzhnostej-professorsko-prepodavatelskogo-sostava/31233-matematika-20-12-2018.html

In addition to the formal application sent according to
the above document, all applicants are invited to send a
copy of their CV to
Maria Rossomakhina (secretariat@chebyshev.spb.ru)
mentioning any detail that could be relevant to the work
of the selection committee, such as, for instance, the
names of PhD students they supervised, if any, etc.

The minimum requirements for the positions are as follows:

Position 1 (Professor)

- the degree of D.Sc. (Doctor of Science) or habilitation
or any degree acknowledged by Russian Federation as a D.Sc.
degree;
- at least five refereed publications indexed
simultaneously in MathSciNet and Scopus in 2013-2018;
- at least five years of experience in research or teaching
(excluding Ph.D. studies but including work on research
projects/grants, even unpaid).

Position 2 (Associate Professor/Docent)

- the degree of Ph. D. (foreign) or Cand. Sci. (Russian);
- at least five refereed publications indexed
simultaneously in MathSciNet and Scopus in 2013-2018;
- at least three years of experience in research or teaching
(excluding Ph.D. studies but including work on research
projects/grants, even unpaid).

Position 3 (Associate Professor/Docent)

- the degree of Ph. D. (foreign) or Cand. Sci. (Russian);
- at least four refereed publications indexed
simultaneously in MathSciNet and Scopus in 2013-2018;
- at least three years of experience in research or teaching
(excluding Ph.D. studies but including work on research
projects/grants, even unpaid).

As mentioned above, responsibilities include lectures and
seminars, advising BSc, MSc and PhD students. Typical basic
subjects that successful applicants are expected to teach
range over all mathematics and theoretical computer science.

Applications and questions on formalities should be sent
to personnel officer Olga Ivanova. Less formal questions
should be sent to Maria Rossomakhina <secretariat@chebyshev.spb.ru>
who can also provide templates for the formal documents
to be submitted to the personnel officer, so we recommend to contact Maria first
and then send the official application.

Please check that your documents are processed normally
(and not lost!) by visiting

http://hr.spbu.ru/konkursy-na-zameshchenie-dolzhnostej-professorsko-prepodavatelskogo-sostava/31233-matematika-20-12-2018.html

a couple of days after sending them.

Deadline: 17:00 MSK, January 30, 2019.
Teaching starts: September 1, 2019.

Our staff elected in the previous application campaigns includes in particular
Youri Davydov (probability theory, previous job -- University of Lille),
Elena Khramtcova (computational geometry, Universite Libre de Bruxelles).
Alexander Okhotin (theoretical computer science, University of Turku),
Svetlana Puzynina (combinatorics, Universite Paris Diderot),
Sergey Tikhomirov (dynamical systems, Max Plank Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Leipzig),
Yury Volkov (algebra, Instituto de Matem??tica e Estat??stica, S??o Paulo).
