I don't know any interesting connection between this law and category
theory or number theory.

I didn't know it was called "Benford's law", but I knew the idea:
if you take a table of widely spread numbers (say the gross national
products of nations, or the incomes of Americans), often about

log 2  ~  30%

will have 1 as their first digit, about

log 3 - log 2  ~  17%

will have 2 as their first digit, and so on.

It's easy to derive this law from the assumption that the data is
distributed in an approximately scale-invariant way within a certain
range.  (That is, the percentage of numbers in your table between
X and cX is about equal to the percentage between Y and cY, for c not
too big, and X and Y within some large but finite range.  Or: the
logarithms of the numbers are approximately uniformly distributed over
some interval.)

So, the mystery of Benford's law reduces to the mystery of this
fact: in practice, widely spread numbers are often distributed
in an approximately scale-invariant way, within some range.

(Perhaps some people find Benford's law mysterious because it's
impossible for a probability distribution to be *perfectly*
scale-invariant.  But that's a red herring.  It's enough to have
approximate scale-invariance within some range, for example a couple
powers of 10.)

Why is approximate scale-invariance so common?  People have
written books on this!  Here's a nice one:

Manfred Schroeder, Chaos, Fractals, Power Laws, W. H. Freeman, 1992.

Or, for starters:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law

I would rather go to a conference on power laws than a conference
on Benford's law, which seems like just a spinoff.

Best,
