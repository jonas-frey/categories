Dorothean Professor in Computer Science at the University of Vermont
====================================================================

Applications (either hardcopy or by e-mail) by January 20, 2003
***************************************************************

The College of Engineering and Mathematics at the University of
Vermont invites applications for the Dorothean Professorship (at the
Full Professor or Associate Professor level) in Computer Science,
commencing with the 2003-04 academic year.  Tenure will be sought at
time of appointment.

The University of Vermont, one of the top public national
universities, is located in Burlington, Vermont.  It offers a
supportive research environment in a relatively small city that
repeatedly has drawn national attention for offering a high quality of
life.  The greater Burlington area includes 125,000 people, and is
situated on the shores of Lake Champlain between the Green Mountains
of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains of New York.  Burlington and
the surrounding area provide an environment rich in cultural and
recreational activities.  The Department of Computer Science offers
programs in the College of Engineering and Mathematics and the College
of Arts and Sciences, as well as a joint program with the School of
Business Administration.

Our existing faculty in Computer Science are involved in the forefront
of research in knowledge and data engineering (such as data mining,
database systems, pattern recognition, and knowledge-based systems),
software engineering and verification (including programming
languages), and computational sciences (including computational
biology, discrete modeling, and numerical methods).  We are seeking to
complement and further strengthen our existing research and teaching
activities in these areas.  Candidates in these areas are most sought,
and candidates in any other area of computer science will also be
considered seriously.

Candidates should have a distinguished research record, hold a
doctorate in Computer Science or a closely related field, and have
broad teaching abilities and interests.  The successful applicant is
expected to (1) play a major role in departmental research initiatives
and the graduate program coordination, (2) strengthen and build
interdisciplinary bridges between the Department of Computer Science
and other departments within the University, and (3) take an active
role in teaching computer science courses.

Please send a letter of interest, a curriculum vitae, a statement of
teaching experience and interests, a statement of research interests
and aspirations to, and arrange for at least three letters of
reference to be sent to

      Chair, Dorothean Professor Search Committee,
      Department of Computer Science,
      University of Vermont,
      Burlington, VT 05405.

Complete applications received by January 20, 2003 will be fully
considered.  For more information about the Department and the College
please see http://www.cs.uvm.edu or email to cssearch@emba.uvm.edu.

The University of Vermont is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity
employer and encourages applications from women and members of
minority groups.
