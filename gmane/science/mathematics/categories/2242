 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ALGEBRAIC AND TOPOLOGICAL METHODS IN NON-CLASSICAL LOGICS

 Tbilisi, Georgia, 7 - 11 July 2003

 The aim of this conference is to present some recent advances in the use of
 algebraic, order-theoretic, and topological methods in non-classical logics.
 We also hope to bring together researchers in the fields of non-classical
 logics, lattice theory, universal algebra, category theory, and general
 topology in order to foster collaboration and to get new ideas for further
 research.

 CONFERENCE TOPICS:

 Lattices with operators
 Topological semantics of modal logic
 Topological and topos semantics of intuitionistic logic
 Ordered topological spaces.

 INVITED SPEAKERS:

 Leo Esakia, Georgian Academy of Sciences
 Mai Gehrke, New Mexico State University
 John Harding, New Mexico State University
 Ramon Jansana, University of Barcelona
 Joachim Lambek, McGill University
 Daniele Mundici, Milan University
