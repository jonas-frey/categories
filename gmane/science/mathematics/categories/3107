My guess is that most of the algebraic topologists assume that the map=20
they are constructing is automatically continuous since the proof will work=
=20
for example for simplicial sets (in which there is no continuity to check).=
=20
And this argument is wrong : because the category of general topological=20
spaces is not cartesian closed while the category of simplicial sets is=20
cartesian closed. And most of these proofs of continuity become possible on=
ly=20
by working in a more convenient category of topological spaces.
