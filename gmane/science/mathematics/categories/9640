(FMCS and BLAST attendees will have seen this before.)

Apropos of affine spaces over a field (the affine real line being a
one-dimensional example), here are some axioms for a language with one
binary operation ab, with (ab)c abbreviated to abc (left-associative
convention as for combinatory algebra etc.), satisfying

A1.  aa = a
A2.  abb = a
A3.  abc = ac(bc)
A4.  abcd = adcb

(Side remark: Axiom Ai requires i variables.)

The intended model of ab is 2b - a over an arbitrary abelian group, e.g.
the integers.  (A4 forces abelian.

Obviously the free algebra on n generators for n < 2 has n elements.

Identify the free algebra F2 on {a,b} with the integers ..., -3, -2, -1, 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, ... as follows.
... baba, aba, ba, a, b, ab, bab, abab, ...

(Exercise: This are the only elements of F2.)

As usual the elements of F2 can be understood as binary operations on F2.
Abbreviate the binary operation identified with n as a[n]b; thus a[0]b = a,
a[1]b = b, a[2]b = ab, a[-1]b = ba, etc.  Interpreting ab as 2b - a over
the integers, a[n]b = a + n(b - a), and 0[n]1 = n, making F2 yet another
binary notation for the integers, albeit exponentially longer.

Now expand this one-operation language with a family c1, c2, c3, c4, ... of
operations of respective finite arities 1, 2, 3, 4, ... satisfying

c1(a) = a
cm(a1, ..., am)[n]cn(a1, ..., an) = an  for all n > 1 where m = n-1
cn(a1, ..., am, cm(a1, ..., am))[n]b = b      ditto

The intended model of cn(a1, ..., an) is the centroid or mean of a1, ...,
an over an arbitrary field, i.e. (a1 + ... + an)/n.

Claim.  The variety defined by this equational theory, including its
homomorphisms as standardly defined, is equivalent to the category of
affine spaces over the rationals.  (Affine transformations over the
rationals are linear combinations whose coefficients sum to 1, e.g.
centroid.  The idea is that other models such as the real line can be
pulled apart by homomorphisms into uncountably many copies of the rational
line because the operations of the theory can only make rational
connections between points of the line.)

I mention this in case it has any bearing on Steve's question about a
point-free version of the real affine line.  Not that I see one myself.
