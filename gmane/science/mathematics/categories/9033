Dear Peter,

A few years ago, I have been looking to a generalization of adjoint =
functors, where there is not necessarily a unit or counit.=20
I am not sure if this is relevant for what you want to do, but maybe the =
technique can be useful.=20

Here is a short description:

If F:C\to D and G:D\to C are two functors, and suppose that everything =
is k-linear (where k is a commutative ring, but this linearity is not =
essential),
then you can construct a Morita context as follows
(Nat(F,F), Nat(G,G)^op, Nat(1,FG), Nat(GF,1), f , g)
Here Nat(F,F) and Nat(G,G)^op are monoids (k-algebras) for the usual =
composition of natural tranformations, and Nat(1,FG) and Nat(GF,1) are =
bimodules between these, e.g. for a\in Nat(1,FG), b\in Nat(F,F) and c\in =
Nat(G,G)^op, we have b.a.c=3D Fc\circ bG\circ a=3DbG\circ Fc\circ a.
The Morita maps are given by f(a\otimes b) =3D Fb\circ aF\in Nat(F,F) =
with a\in Nat(1,FG) and b\in Nat(GF,1), and a similar formula for g.

Now you can observe that F and G are adjoint if and only if the above =
Morita context contains invertible elements that make it a strict =
context; explictly this means that there exist elements u\in Nat(1,FG) =
and e\in Nat(GF,1) such that f(u\otimes e)=3D1_F and g(e\otimes u)=3D1_G. =
Of course, u and e are exactly the unit and counit of the adjunction.

The generalized notions of adjoint functors I mentioned above, were =
obtained by considering arbitrary surjective Morita maps, which means =
that you have not a single unit and counit, but finite sets of =
=E2=80=9Cunits=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ccounits=E2=80=9D which satisfy =
still an appropriate condition (for this to work you need indeed to work =
in the k-linear, or at least an enriched, setting). It is temptative to =
call =E2=80=9Cquasi-adjoint=E2=80=9D functors since it is related to =
quasi-Frobenius algebras.

Another variation is to consider the case where f(u\otimes e) is not the =
identity natural transformation on F, but it is a natural transformation =
that is the identity map on FX for only a (finite) number of objects X =
in C.
This is related to =E2=80=9CcoFrobenius coalgebras=E2=80=9D.

For details, you can have a look at=20
M. Iovanov and J. Vercruysse, Cofrobenius Corings and adjoint Functors, =
Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, 212 (9), 2027-2058 (2008).

Best wishes,
Joost.
