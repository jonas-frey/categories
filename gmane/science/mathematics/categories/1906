Here's an adjunction from which various basic results in category theory can
be read off.  (Useful, but somewhat inward-looking...)

Fix a small category C, and consider the forgetful functor 

U: [C^op, Set] ---> [ob C, Set].  

This has a left adjoint F, which can easily be written down explicitly (and
whose existence is also guaranteed because it's a Kan extension).  Hence U
preserves limits - and this is part of what's meant by the statement that
limits are computed pointwise in a presheaf category.  Moreover, the
adjunction is monadic, from which it follows that

(a) U creates limits (which is the rest of what's meant by the "computed
pointwise" slogan), and

(b) every presheaf is the colimit of representables (using the fact that
every algebra for a monad is a coequalizer of free algebras).

Dually, U has a right adjoint, so the dual results also hold.
