Dear All,

With pleasure, and hot on the heels of the latest announcement, we
like to invite you for
PSSL 99, a special PSSL in honor of Jirka Adamek's retirement.

This will take place in Braunschweig, from March 11 to March 13, 2016.

Due to the special nature of this event, we already have some invited
speakers, so the number of slots for additional talks is limited.
These will be assigned on a first-come first-serve basis.  However, as
we are planning to have a Festschrift, any contribution will be
considered for this.

All relevant information and a registration form can be found at

http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/~koslowj/PSSL99

This will be updated periodically, in particular with details
concerning accommodation.  Once these are available, we will notify
you on this list.

Hoping to see many of you in Braunschweig next March,

-- J??rgen Koslowski
     Stefan Milius
     Henning Urbat
