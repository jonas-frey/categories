Quoted from Jean-Pierre Marquis email: "yes, of course, Salmon is
certainly one of the important contributors to the field [scientific
explanation]. In mathematics, Paolo Mancosu has been pushing the issue
for the past 10 years or so, following the paths of Steiner, Resnik and
a few others."

In science, the issue of explanation has been discussed for at least a
century. Since mathematics is a formal system and not a physical system,
we have to be more careful about what *explanation* means. This makes it
a "worldview" problems? As a constructionist/computationalist I would
say no constructive, computational proof then there is no explanation.
Platonist have their own. Is their explanation useful to me? Don't know
because if I can figure a constructive technique out from the plationic
technique, I'm good.
