In his Tohoku paper, Grothendieck asserted with no proof that in any
category it is possible to choose subobjects for each object so that each
monomorphism is isomorphic to a unique subobject of the codomain and in
such a way that a subobject of a subobject of an object is also one of the
chosen subobjects of the original objects.  Maybe I am being dense, but I
don't see how this is always possible.  Does anyone on the list?  I also
don't see what possible value there is in making such a choice, but this
doubtless was not clear in 1957.

The translation (and revision) is coming along fine and I expect to
release it within a month.
