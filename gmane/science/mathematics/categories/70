The trouble with this is that the floor function isn't constructive - the
question "is x<2" is undecidable in the reals, but decidable in the
natural numbers.

The problem with the obvious definition:
"Take the set of natural numbers below x, and take the join of this set."
is that the natural numbers don't have K~-finite joins, only K-finite
ones.

Incidentally, has anyone looked at semilattices with K~-finite joins? (Or
whatever your favourite notion of finiteness is.) Is there any use for
something like the completion of N under K~-finite joins, other than
allowing us to define the floor function?
