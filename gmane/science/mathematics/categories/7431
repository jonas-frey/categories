One factor might be that the philosophical tradition also has the
terminology "category", but means rather different things by it,
and they tend to use "categorial" (I think, but I haven't really
checked). In particular, both Kant and Husserl use categorial a lot.
So (since we started using the word category later than the philosophers
did) saying "categorical" is a way of avoiding confusion.

(Philosophers do use the pair hypothetical/categorical as a way of
talking about preconditions for assertions, but that's so different from
what we do that it's unlikely to cause confusion). All of this is off
the top of my head, and could do with checking.
