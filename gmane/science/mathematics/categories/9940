CALL FOR PAPERS JOINT SYCO-STRING WORKSHOP

3rd Annual Workshop on String Diagrams in
Computation, Logic, and Physics
(STRING 2019)

and the

Fifth Symposium on Compositional Structures
(SYCO 5)

STRING diagrams are a powerful tool for reasoning about processes and
composition. Originally developed as a convenient notation for the
arrows of monoidal and higher categories, they are increasingly used
in the formal study of digital circuits, control theory, concurrency,
quantum and classical computation, natural language processes, logic
and more. String diagrams combine the advantages of formal syntax with
intuitive aspects: the graphical nature of terms means that they often
reflect the topology of systems under consideration. Moreover,
diagrammatic reasoning transforms formal arguments into dynamic,
moving images, thus building domain specific intuitions, valuable both
for practitioners and pedagogy.

The Symposium on Compositional Structures is a new interdisciplinary
series of meetings aiming to support the growing community of
researchers interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from
both applied and abstract perspectives, and in particular where
category theory serves as a unifying common language. We welcome
submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics,
physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly
discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge between
fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature research and work in
progress, and by both established academics and junior researchers,
including students.

Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions.
The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even
if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. You could submit
work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or even a PhD or
Masters thesis.

While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO-STRING welcomes
submissions with a compositional focus related to any of the following
areas, in particular (but not necessarily) from the perspective of
category theory:

* logical methods in computer science, including classical and quantum
programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language processing and
machine learning;
* graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and
reaction networks;
* languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets,
type theory and game semantics;
* abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal
category theory, higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and
relationships to homotopy theory;
* quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation theory;
* tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof
assistants, and game theory;
* industrial applications, including case studies and real-world
problem descriptions.

Invited speakers
----------------
* Aleks Kissinger, Oxford
* Jean Krivine, CNRS Paris
* Koko Muroya, RIMS Kyoto
* Detlef Plump, York
* Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, QMU London
* (more TBA)

Important dates
---------------
All deadlines are 23:59 anywhere-on-earth on the given dates.

Submission deadline: 24 July 2019
Author notification: 7 August 2019
Travel support application deadline: To be announced
Registration: To be announced
Event dates: Wednesday 4 September to Friday 6 September 2019.

SYCO will take place on Wednesday 4 September and the morning of
Thursday 5 September.
STRING will take place on the afternoon of Thursday 5 September and
all day on Friday 6 September.

Submissions
-----------
Submission for both meetings will be by a single EasyChair page. There
will be a single programme committee. Submission is now open:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dstrings3andsyco5

Submissions should present research results in sufficient detail to
allow them to be properly considered. We encourage the submission of
work in progress, as well as mature results. There are no proceedings,
so work can be submitted even if it has been previously published, or
has been submitted for consideration elsewhere. There is no specific
formatting requirement, and no page limit, although for long
submissions authors should be aware that reviewers will not be able to
read the entire document in detail. Think creatively=E2=80=94you could subm=
it
a recent paper, draft notes of a project in progress, or even a recent
Masters or PhD thesis.

To indicate the meeting for which you would like your submission to be
considered, append "(STRING)" or "(SYCO)" in the title field of the
EasyChair submission page. If you would be happy for it to be
presented at either meeting, you may append both.

If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous SYCO
meeting, it will not automatically be considered for SYCO 5; you still
need to submit it again explicitly. Such a submission will be
prioritised for inclusion in the SYCO 5 programme. When submitting,
append "(DEFERRED FROM SYCO X)" to the title of your paper, replacing
"X" with the appropriate meeting number. There is no need to attach
any documents.
