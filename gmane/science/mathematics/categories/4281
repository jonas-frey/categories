If we leave out "the structure map is the identity", I have no
problem. The 2nd part seems to be rather cosmetical anyway, but in a
bad sense of hiding the structure. Yes, I know you save some ink...

Exactly, the discussion is similar to the question whether the carta
of human rights should be written in English or French. I don't care
whether foundations are expressed in the language of predicate logic,
category theory or type theory  as long as they make sense (to me).
Having said this I prefer the latter two, which work very well
together, but this again has to do with beauty as opposed to cosmetics.

Precisely!
