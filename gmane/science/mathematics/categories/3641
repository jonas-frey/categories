Dear all,

This is to announce the availability of two preprints.

1)
"Group valued differential forms revisited"

We study the relationship between combinatorial group valued
differential forms and classical differential forms with values in
the corresponding Lie algebra. In particular, we compare simplicial
coboundary and exterior derivative. The results represent
strengthening of results I obtained in 1982.

This preprint can be downloaded from

or from my home page

2)
"Some matrices with nilpotent entries, and their determinants"

We study algebraic properties of matrices whose rows are mutual
neighbours, and are also neigbours of 0 (neighbour in the sense of a
certain nilpotency condition). The intended application is in synthetic
differential geometry. For a square matrix of this kind, the product of
the diagonal entries equals the determinant, modulo a factor n!

This preprint can be downloaded from
http://arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0612435

or from my home page (address as above).


Yours
Anders
