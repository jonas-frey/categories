Thanks for these comments.

I was mainly investigating the acceptance of these terms by the categorical
community, to decide if I should change for the new edition of my old book.

I agree with Paul's comments to me personally that it is a good idea to
avoid overworked terms (like `universal').

The issue is that for a morphism f: G \to H of groupoids, the notion of
quotient introduced by Philip Higgins, namely if f is full and Ob(f) is
surjective, is fine. The other important notion is that f comes from an
identification of objects, which in Paul's terminology would be supine
(w.r.t. the opfibration Ob: Gpds \to Sets). More vivid would be H is a
0-identification of G, that is the groupoid H is then obtained from G by an
identification of objects. It would tie in with other situations to say that
H is induced from G by Ob(f).

There is a good case for not introducing new words.

Ronnie
