Steve also makes the following nice point.

This last step follows from Steve's point that the empty meet is top.

Yet another way of analyzing this, also constructive if we view dynamic
logic as "constructive" in some sense, is as I proposed in my 1976 paper
"Semantical Considerations on Floyd-Hoare Logic," namely as the box and
diamond modalities for the nondeterministic assignment x := ?, which is
the binary relation consisting of all pairs (I, I') where I' is the
interpretation (world, state) obtained from I by setting x to an
arbitrary value from the domain.

For the empty domain, x := ? is the empty program 0, having the property
[0]P = 1 and <0>P = 0 for all formulas P.

That's not to say I agree with Steve's argument, which is the same one
certain universal algebraists (not Tarski to my knowledge) used to make,
both in Volume 1 of the McKenzie, McNulty and Taylor book (1987, out of
print, 2nd hand price $253.99 at Amazon, Volume 2 is currently being
written according to Ralph Freese) and at the 1993 MSRI conference
Universal Algebra and Category Theory, namely that the empty universe
rendered certain standard theorems of predicate calculus false, for
example the one Dusko cited.

Both Dusko's proof of "(all) x.P(x) => (exists) x.P(x)" and Steve's
counterexample to its truth have (modulo precise choice of example) been
standard fare in logic for well over half a century.  (I first heard
about this so-called "logic of the non-empty universe," LNEU, from a
curmudgeonly Philosophy I tutor at St. Andrews college in 1961, and was
duly impressed: how one should reason in the empty universe seemed a
small point in logic but a giant leap for philosophy from the question
of how many angels could dance on the head of a pin.)

The rationale I gave on Monday for sticking to the standard
axiomatization of first order logic, which proves Dusko's formula,
Steve's objection to it notwithstanding, was as follows.

"Seems to create fewer problems" being the sort of sentence any
Wikipedia editor would these days tag as "weasel words", I should be
more explicit about the sorts of problems it can create.

If I've understood Steve's reasoning, he accepts

TRUE(a) --> (exists) x. TRUE(x)

as a theorem of FOL that holds even in the empty universe, on the ground
that it is "vacuously true" (where I would have said vacuously valid).

The same reasoning would also appear to justify

TRUE(a)

as a theorem of FOL.  (Note that both formulas are standard FOL
theorems, with both holding in every nonempty universe.)

But by Modus Ponens, which I can't imagine Steve rejecting, we obtain

(exists) x. TRUE(x)

which Steve has judged as false.

Since falsehood is the criterion by which Steve has been judging
theoremhood, unless I've misinterpreted Steve it seems to me that his
approach to handling the empty universe is unsound.

For ease of reference I've put online my proof that cylindric algebra
semantics handles all this in stride by making the pertinent Boolean
algebra the one-element inconsistent one whenever Steve and Dusko
disagree on this point.  Currently it's at
http://boole.stanford.edu/Empty/ but I'm open to suggestions for a
suitable more permanent resting place.
