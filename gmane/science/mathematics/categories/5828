I introduced the terminology "quasi-category" as an alternative name=20
for weak Kan complexes because I wanted to suggest that the theory of =
these objects=20
was closer to category theory than to the theory of Kan complexes.
For example, the notion of an initial object in a quasi-category=20
is very important, like that of initial object in a category.
But only a contractible Kan complex can have an initial object.=20
The theory of quasi-categories turns out to be amazingly close to =
category theory
despite the fact that its natural setting is simplicial homotopy theory.
The name "quasi-category" is for me less frightening than
"infinity-category" which has the name of God into it.
More seriously, why should we attach the prefix "infinity" to an object=20
which is no more endless than the set of natural numbers, or the set of =
rational numbers,=20
or the simplicial category Delta? The terminology could be reflecting =
the
(relative) failure of the algebraic approach to higher categories.
An algebraic description of homotopy type of the 2-sphere is missing
and it could be endless. But the 2-sphere is easy to describe =
simplicially:=20

   S^2=3D Delta[2]/partial \Delta[2]


Best,=20

My personal opinion is that this process is very much influenced
by the pressure of "bibliometry", "impact factors" and other "modern
trends" - people often not very scrupulously invent and reinvent
terminology to be better cited, and, conscious or not, it often very
much smells of imposture.
