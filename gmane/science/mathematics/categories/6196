Thanks Thomas for bringing up the intensional type theory perspective. Here
equality of objects in categories is a serious problem already for sets,
or rather for their type theoretic counterpart, setoids (types with
equivalence classes). The so-called identity types give a minimal
equality on each type A: Id(A,a,b) are the proofs that a and b
are equal in A. But the fact that these proofs are in general not
unique and induces a groupoid structure makes it difficult to apply
when e.g. A is a universe of types. Some remarks are contained in
in this preprint

http://www.mittag-leffler.se/preprints/files/IML-0910f-36.pdf


If one tries to use the Id-types to define equality on (small) setoids
one ends up with a groupoid of objects rather than a setoid objects.
I think the situation can be described as follows for a general category K,
which we think of as a category without equality of objects. We now
want to induce an equality of objects on (a part of) K. Take a
groupoid G and a functor F:G -> K. We define the groupoids of
objects C_0, arrows C_1 and composable arrows C_2 in a natural
way. C_0 is G and C_1 has for objects triples (a,b,f) where a,b in G
and f:F(a) -> F(b), and a morphism (a,b,f) -> (a',b',f') is a pair of
G morphisms r:a -> a' and s:b -> b' with F(s) f = f' F(r). C_2 has for
objects pairs of morphisms composable with an mediating map m from G,
i.e. ((a,b,f),(c,d,g),m). The composition is g F(m)f. The morphisms of
C_2 are then pairs of C_1 morphisms

((r,s), (t,u)): ((a,b,f),(c,d,g),m) -> ((a',b',f'),(c',d',g'),m')

with m's= t m.

When G is a discrete groupoid this becomes a standard category. When G is
a groupoid it becomes almost a category. Notions of limits can be
formulated in a natural fashion. At least when K=Setoids, C inherits
limits from K. Perhaps some general results are known about this
construction of C from functor F:G -> K on a groupoid G?
