Quantified computational effects and interaction

*epartment of Computer Science, Reykjavik University

One postdoc position

Applications are invited for one postdoctoral position at the
Department of Computer Science, Reykjavik University.  The position is
part of a three-year research project funded by the Icelandic Research
Fund under the direction of Tarmo Uustalu. The overarching goal of to
advance the theory and practice of disciplined effectful programming,
based on graded monads, monad-like structures and interaction
laws. Interested applicants should contact the PI (email tarmo@ru.is)
for closer details on the research proposal.

The successful candidate will benefit from, and contribute to, the
research environment at the Icelandic Centre of Excellence in
Theoretical Computer Science (ICE-TCS), with research groups on

Tokyo and the University of Wroclaw.

*Qualification requirements*

Applicants for the postdoctoral position should have, or be about to
defend, a PhD degree in Computer Science or a closely related
field. Previous knowledge of at least one of lambda calculus and
functional programming, proof theory/type theory, programming language
semantics, category theory in computer science, proof assistants is a
prerequisite.

*Remuneration*

The wage will be approx 500 kISK per month before income tax, but
depend on the qualifications and experience of the postdoc. Check
