CALL FOR PAPERS
Workshop on Compositional Approaches in Physics, NLP, and Social =
Sciences

September 2 2018
Nice, France

https://sites.google.com/view/capns2018/home

*************

Compositional Approaches for NLP, Physics, and Social Sciences (CAPNS =
2018) will be colocated with QI 2018 =
(http://qi2018.quantum-interaction.org/). The workshop is a continuation =
and extension of the Workshop on Semantic Spaces at the Intersection of =
NLP, Physics and Cognitive Science =
https://sites.google.com/site/semspworkshop/ held in June 2016.=20

AIMS AND SCOPE
The ability to compose parts to form a more complex whole, and to =
analyze a whole as a combination of elements, is desirable across =
disciplines. In this workshop we bring together researchers applying =
compositional approaches to NLP, Physics, Cognitive Science, and Game =
Theory. The categorical model of Coecke et al. [2010], inspired by =
quantum protocols, has provided a convincing account of compositionality =
in vector space models of NLP. Similar category-theoretic approaches =
have been applied in cognitive science, and now are being extended to =
game theory. The interplay between the three disciplines will foster =
theoretically motivated approaches to understanding how meanings of =
words interact in sentences and discourse, how concepts develop, and how =
complex games can be analyzed. Commonalities between the compositional =
mechanisms employed may be extracted, and applications and phenomena =
traditionally thought of as 'non-compositional' will be examined.

Topics of interests include (but are not restricted to):
Applications of quantum logic in natural language processing and =
cognitive science
Compositionality in vector space models of meaning
Compositionality in conceptual spaces
Compositional approaches to game theory
Reasoning in vector spaces and conceptual spaces
Conceptual spaces in linguistics
Game-theoretic models of language and conceptual change
Category-theoretic diagrammatic reasoning for natural language =
processing, cognitive science, and game theory
Compositional explanations of so-called 'non-compositional' phenomena =
such as metaphor

IMPORTANT DATES:
June 30th: Paper submission
July 15th: Notification to contributors
September 2nd: Workshop date

CONFIRMED SPEAKERS:
Gerhard J=C3=A4ger, Professor of General Linguistics, University of =
T=C3=BCbingen
Paul Smolensky, Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research, and =
Krieger-Eisenhower Professor of Cognitive Science, Johns Hopkins =
University

SUBMISSIONS:
We invite:
Original contributions (up to 12 pages) of previously unpublished work. =
Submission of substantial, albeit partial results of work in progress is =
welcomed.

Extended abstracts (3 pages) of previously published work that is recent =
and relevant to the workshop. These should include a link to a =
separately published paper or preprint.

Contributions should be submitted at:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcapns2018
