Thanks to Peter, Peter, and George for the uniformly equivalent answers
to my question (in striking contrast to the decided lack of uniformity
of the responses to other recent topics on this list).  (Bill's response
was less an answer than a pointer to related work with "commutative" in
place of "free" in my question, interesting but for different reasons.)
  I should have noticed that free monoids were a red herring, and I have
no idea why I restricted to z=1 in xy=xz->y=z.

The crux of the obstacle to axiomatizing the nonabelian case is clearly
brought out by Malcev's Condition Z cited by George Janelidze as

 >
 >   (as = bt) & (cs = dt) & (au = bv) => (cu = dv);
 >

If you could just shuffle the terms around, Z along with the larger
"quasiidentities" would all collapse under cancellation, as everyone
pointed out.

At first glance one might think to organize Condition Z with proof nets
of some kind, something along the lines of

au = bv
|    |
as = bt
.|    |
cs = dt
-------
cu = dv

and so on for longer such sorites along with (independent?) reflections
of each side.  (The stray dot is against mailers that delete leading
spaces, apologies to those not receiving this in a fixed-width font.)

However googling for relevant material led to a 194-page St. Andrew's
thesis submitted last July on "Presentations for subsemigroups of
groups" by Alan Cain, available at

http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~alanc/maths/publications/c_phdthesis/c_phdthesisonesided.ps

The preface indicates how one can do better via J.-C. Spehner's notion
of a Malcev presentation.  (Anyone know if this is the same J.-C.
Spehner as does computational geometry at Labo MAGE?)

Spehner's basic idea, on the semantic side, is that if it is known by
all parties (writers and readers) that the intended congruence on a
semigroup S makes S/~ embeddable in a group, then one can uniquely
determine ~ with less of it than without that knowledge.  The crucial
fact here is that the family of all congruences ~ on a semigroup S for
which S/~ embeds in a group is closed under arbitrary (including empty)
intersection (consider the product of the witnessing embedding groups).
Hence any binary relation R on a semigroup S has a unique minimal
extension to such a congruence, namely the intersection of all such
congruences containing R.  A Malcev presentation of a desired such
congruence is any binary relation R that generates it in this way.

So in particular if au = bv, as = bt, and cs = dt are all in R, then the
conclusion cu = dv of Condition Z is in this "Malcev closure" of R.

On the syntactic side, the appropriate term rewriting system
incorporating this knowledge of group-embeddability augments the
vocabulary with left and right inverses of generators, allowing this
conclusion to be obtained equationally, without resorting to
quasiidentities, as

cu = csSu = dtSu = dBbtSu = dBasSu = dBau = dBbv = dv

where I've written S for the right inverse of s and B for the left
inverse of b for want of a third flavor of s and b in ASCII.

After developing the basis for, and variants of, all this, the thesis
then dives into automatic semigroups, a subject with a rich literature
and some very deep results that I have so far been completely unable to
motivate myself to participate in (starting with Michael Arbib's
lectures on this general genre at Sydney University in the Australian
winter of 1967, give or take a winter, and then more lectures in the
same vein in 1969 by John Rhodes at Berkeley).  Maybe some day I'll see
the point of it all, though so far I've had more success eventually
seeing the point of Max Kelly's 1965 lectures on category theory, that
only took two decades (slow learner).  I'm fine with algebraic logic
(which was my route back to category theory in 1983), algebraic automata
theory seems an altogether different kettle of fish -- the deployment of
weapons of math destruction in an unwinnable war on the combinatorial
complexity of automata and semigroups.

Again, many thanks for the answers and pointers!
