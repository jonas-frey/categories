Dear Andr=E9,

This is possible with this conception :
A "monoid" in a monoidal category is what Benabou call *monad* in his =20
paper on bicat=E9gories. The more general notion of "category", in the =20
same vein, is the notion of *polyad* (in the same paper of Benabou --- =20
apologize me : I have not the reference whith me): the objets are =20
given externally.

I don't know if my remark you satisfie, I think not (you have had =20
certainly yourself this idea), but, for me, the moral of this fact =20
seems to say that the equality of objets have something of =20
intrinsically very different of morphisms.
(This meets perhaps the ideas of Bob Par=E9 on index categories)

I am convided of this (If I have the occasion, I will explain this).
Best,
Albert
