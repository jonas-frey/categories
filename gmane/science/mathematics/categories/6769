Is the "axiom of stack completions" related to the "axiom of small
cardinality selection" used by Makkai to prove that the bicategory of
anafunctors is cartesian closed?  I think I recall a remark in
Makkai's paper to the effect that the stack completion of a category C
is at least morally the same as the category Ana(1,C) of "ana-objects"
of C.

Are there known examples of elementary toposes which violate the axiom
of stack completions?
