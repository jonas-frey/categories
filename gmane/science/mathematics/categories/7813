> 1) If you work in an elementary topos SS, then it is true that you can do s=
o "as in Sets", provided you do not use excluded middle ( as the internal lo=
gic is intuitionistic) or use Choice (as the set theory intrinsic to SS is c=
onstructive).
>=20
> 2) If on the other hand you work in a topos EE that is bounded over SS, th=
en you cannot work "as in Sets" concerning constructions in EE that involve S=
S. Here it is necessary to resort to either the "teoria delle categorie sopr=
a un topos di base" (indexed categories) or to the theory of fibrations.=20
>=20
> Concerning your question, let me point out that, although you pretend to w=
ork entirely inside SS, you do not, as your construction involves EE. It cer=
tainly makes sense, since EE is locally small, and CC is small ( meaning int=
ernal to SS). What I want to warn you about is how you proceed from there wi=
thout resorting to EE as a bounded SS- topos.=20

>  I apologize for previous (private) irrelevant remarks as I misunderstood y=
our question - until now, that is.
>=20
> Concerning Diaconescu's theorem, AC implies Booleaness can be done "as in S=
ets" but the proof is not trival. If you mean the theorem which gives a char=
acterization of bounded SS-toposes as a classifying topos, it requires fibra=
tions over SS.=20
