Dear fellow category theorists,

I'm interested in finding out at what level of generality a result that pla=
inly holds in Sets (and Sets^op) is true:

Given two epimorphisms f:A-->>B and g:C-->D, the square formed by f x 1_C, =
1_A x g, f x 1_D and=20
1_B x D is a pushout.

I'd like it to be true (at least) in toposes and I think I have an element-=
wise proof (but don't remember the details of the semantics given by, for i=
nstance, Osius, well enough to be sure I've really proven the result in all=
  toposes -- it's been years since I thought seriously about that sort of th=
ing).

And, is there anywhere in the literature that this occurs?  It feels like t=
he sort of thing that would have been known long ago.

Best Thoughts,
