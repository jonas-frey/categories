Hi, Tom.

Congrats on the successful completion of your book!

I really like your idea on a second book.  Such a book would be
very helpful for young researchers and students in my opinion.

Has anyone thought about doing it as a group effort in the same
spirit as the homotopy type theory book was?

A number of authors would make the writing burden far less per author,
and potentially speed up the writing process.

Anyway, just an idea.

I really like how you're are making your new book editable and readable for
free in 18 months.  This is a great idea, and a service to the community.

The second book should do the same.

Very best,
.\ Harley
