cca 1991, i mentioned to mike barr that the functoriality of adjoints was
derivable, and he knew it already. i think he said that this was used by
isbell.

(it's embarassing that i remember things from so long ago; and also that i
don't remember them clearly enough to be confident. but does it really
matter? when we optimize, we often find it more efficient not to store
some data, but to regenerate when needed...)
