THIRD AND FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

Third International Symposium on
Foundations of Health Information Engineering and Systems
http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/FHIES2013/

International Institute for Software Technology
United Nations University, Macau
21st-23rd August, 2013


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CHANGES SINCE PREVIOUS CALL

Submission deadline extended by two weeks, to May 20th.
Additional category of extended abstracts (max 2 pages) solicited.
Apologies for duplication.


BACKGROUND

ICT plays an increasingly enabling role in addressing the global challe=
nges of healthcare, in both the developed and the developing world. The=
  use of software in medical devices has caused growing concerns in rela=
tion to safety and efficacy. The increasing adoption of health informat=
ion systems provides great potential benefits but also poses severe ris=
ks, both with respect to security and privacy and in regard to patient =
safety. Hospital and other information systems raise important issues o=
f workflow support and interoperability. Regulators, manufacturers and =
clinical users have pointed out the need to research sound and science-=
based engineering methods that facilitate the development and certifica=
tion of quality ICT systems in health care. Such methods may draw from =
or combine techniques from various disciplines, including but not limit=
ed to software engineering, electronic engineering, computing science, =
information science, mathematics, and industrial engineering.


AIMS

The purpose of the symposium series on Foundations of Health Informatio=
n Engineering and Systems is to promote a nascent research area that ai=
ms to develop and apply theories and methods from a variety of discipli=
nes for the purpose of modeling, building and certifying software-inten=
sive ICT systems in healthcare. A particular objective of FHIES is to e=
xplicitly include a focus on healthcare ICT applications in the develop=
ing world (in addition to systems used in the developed countries), sin=
ce unique engineering challenges arise in that special setting. Because=
  humans often play a pivotal role in the process of using such systems,=
  theories from the human factors engineering community may need to be i=
ntegrated with methods from the technology-oriented domains in order to=
  create effective engineering methodologies for socio-technical systems=
  in the healthcare domain. Previous FHIES symposia were held in 2011, i=
n Mabalingwe, South Africa (with post-conference proceedings in Springe=
r LNCS 7151, and in 2012, in Paris, France (with post-conference procee=
dings to appear in Springer LNCS).


SCOPE

FHIES seeks contributions from both the solution domain (engineering me=
thods) and the problem domain (healthcare and health informatics). Solu=
tion-domain papers should present their methods in the context of a con=
crete application in healthcare, while problem-domain papers should be =
devised to educate the methods community about unique challenges and ch=
aracteristics of the healthcare domain. Submissions should seek to info=
rm and further the development, adaptation, evaluation and adoption of =
formally based and rigorous engineering methods in health care systems.=
  Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* modelling, analysis, simulation and verification in health informatic=
s;
* design and verification techniques for software-based ICT and softwar=
e-intensive medical devices;
* application and integration of foundational methods from different di=
sciplines in engineering and science to health informatics;
* specific engineering challenges of ICT-based health service delivery =
in different settings, especially in the developing world.

For a more detailed list of topics, see the symposium website.

CATEGORIES

We solicit high quality full submissions in the following categories:

* original research contributions (16 pages max)
* application experience, case studies and software prototypes (16 page=
s max.)
* surveys, comparisons, and state-of-the-art reports (16 pages max.)
* position papers identifying challenges and milestones of a research p=
roject (8 pages max.)

We also invite short submissions for special sessions:

* student papers on work in progress on an MSc or PhD project (4 pages =
max.)
* tool demonstrations (2 pages max.)
* proposals to organize birds-of-a-feather sessions or panels (2 pages =
max.)
* extended abstracts (2 pages max.)


SUBMISSIONS

Submissions should be in English, prepared in the LNCS format (http://w=
ww.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html), and all page limits are measure=
d in this format.  Full submissions (those in the first four categories=
  above) will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the=
  field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the sympos=
ium; student papers will be judged on clarity of description and the pr=
omise of interesting results; tool demonstrations, BOF proposals, and e=
xtended abstracts will be judged on relevance to the symposium. All pap=
ers will be peer-reviewed by at least three program committee members. =
  Papers should be submitted via EasyChair, at

   http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfhies2013

Submission constitutes a commitment for at least one author to attend t=
he symposium and present the paper, if it is accepted.


PUBLICATION

All accepted submissions will be distributed in a technical report at t=
he Symposium. After the event, postproceedings will be published in Spr=
inger LNCS. Authors of all accepted full submissions will be invited to=
  revise their papers, in order to resolve any larger issues raised duri=
ng reviewing. Authors of accepted short submissions will be invited to =
submit full papers for review and LNCS publication too.  In addition, a=
  special issue of a suitable journal is planned, focusing on the overal=
l objectives of FHIES: this will have an open call for contributions.
