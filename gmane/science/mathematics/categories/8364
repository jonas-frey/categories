With reference to Tarmo's examples---it's perhaps worth pointing out the
notion of an "ideal monad" on a category with coproducts. One way of
defining an ideal monad is in terms of an endofunctor T together with a
natural transformation m:T(1+T)--->T satisfying two axioms:=20

- m.T(inl) =3D 1: T--->T
- m.T(inr.m) =3D m.(m.Tinr)(1+T): TT(1+T) ---> T.=20

This is something stronger than a non-unital monad; if (T,m) is as
above, then (T, m.T(inr)) is a non-unital monad. The extra strength
means that from such a pair (T,m) one obtains a monad structure on 1+T
in an obvious way. All of the examples Tarmo mentions possess this extra
strength.
