That's a very interesting question!  There seem to be a lot of axioms
of this flavor, which say in various different ways that AC fails "in
only a small way".  Some that I am aware of include:

* Small Violations of Choice (Blass):
   http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/small+violations+of+choice
* Small Cardinality Selection (Makkai):
   http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/small+cardinality+selection+axiom
* Axiom of Multiple Choice (Moerdijk & Palmgren):
   http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/axiom+of+multiple+choice
* Weakly Initial Sets of Covers (Roberts):
   http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/WISC
* The ex/lex completion of Set (or the topos in question) is well-powered
* The ex/lex completion of Set is a topos, i.e. Set has a generic proof

Some of these hold in any Grothendieck topos, but others apparently
need not, and I have no idea which of them might hold in Eff.  It
would be interesting to know if any of them imply ASC (or Andr=E9's
proposed strengthening thereof).
