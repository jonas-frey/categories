Correctness by Construction, Workshop, Genoa, Italy, 24-27 March 2014

                             http://corcon2014.net/

      Correctness by Construction (CORCON) is an FP7 EU-funded project under
      the Marie Curie IRSES scheme. This kick-off workshop of CORCON aims at
      bringing together the participants of the project and those researchers
      who are interested in the themes of the project. The workshop is further
      promoted by AILA (Associazione Italiana di Logica e sue Applicazioni), by
      IC-EATCS (Italian Chapter of the European Association for Theoretical
      Computer Science) and by the Italian national research project Logical
      Methods of Information Management.

Themes of the Project

         Proof Theory, Type Theory and Constructive Set Theory
         Constructive Topology and Analysis
         Homotopy Type Theory
         Categorical Logic
         Programming Languages for Correct by Construction Programming
         Correct by Construction Programs over Continuous Data
         Correct by Construction Programs with Limited Resources

More details, including speakers, programme, registration, travel and
accommodation, are available on the project web page.
