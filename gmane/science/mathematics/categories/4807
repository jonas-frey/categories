This is getting peripheral to the main point.  AS far as I recall, I
thought of T as a test object.  As for epsilon-delta, Bishop required that
delta be prescribed as a constructible function of epsilon in order that a
function be continuous.  He required that the convergence be uniform on
every closed interval, so that this function on a closed interval was
independent of the points in the interval.
