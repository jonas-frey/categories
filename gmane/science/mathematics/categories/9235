Dear Robert,

Yes, I was aware of the 1974 Montreal seminar. But I think it falls
outside my self-imposed restriction of including only meetings
held during the summer months (June to September). So too do
the Aarhus `Open House' meetings of 1973 and 1977, since they were
both in May; and the Dalhousie meeting of 1971 which produced SLN 274,
since that was in January.

I've added to the list the earlier Oberwolfach meetings quoted by Walter,
the La Jolla meeting (7-12 June 1965), the Z\"urich meeting of the
Midwest Category Seminar (24-30 August 1970), and the l'Aquila workshop
on categorical topology (31 August-4 September 1994) which I had
overlooked because I didn't attend it.

Best regards,
Peter
