Eventually generalizing the boycott to Springer might be necessary, but=20=

I am reminded of a story from the days of the "Old West" here in Kansas =
in which

the
town (I think it was Abilene) by obliging the Texas cowboys who had =

The scientific community needs to do the same -- bringing down, or =

others

feasible:
young folk worried about "impact factors" because they don't yet have a
job are left with more publication venues from which to chose while
avoiding Elsevier.

Best Thoughts,
