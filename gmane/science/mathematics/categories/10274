  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? Post-proceedings of the TYPES 2020
  ???????? 26th International Conference on Types for Proofs and Programs
TYPES is a major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects
of type theory and its applications. TYPES 2020 wasn???t held in Turin as
planned because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Nonetheless the significant
number of submissions and registrations testified the interest for TYPES
in our community, motivating us to plan publishing post-proceedings. The
post-proceedings volume will be published in LIPIcs, Leibniz
International Proceedings in Informatics
<http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics>, an open-access series
of conference proceedings.
Submission to this post-proceedings volume is open to everyone, also to
those who did not submit a contribution to the conference. We welcome
high-quality descriptionsof original work, as well as position papers,
overview papers, and system descriptions. Submissions should be written
in English, _not overlapping with published or simultaneously submitted
work to a journal or a conference with archival proceedings_.
We would like to invite all researchers that study and apply type
systems to share their results. In particular, we welcome submissions on
the following topics:

   *
     Foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics;
   *
     Homotopy type theory;
   *
     Applications of type theory;
   *
     Dependently typed programming;
   *
     Industrial uses of type theory technology;
   *
     Meta-theoretic studies of type systems;
   *
     Proof assistants and proof technology;
   *
     Automation in computer-assisted reasoning;
   *
     Links between type theory and functional programming;
   *
     Formalizing mathematics using type theory;
   *
     Type theory in linguistics.

Important dates:

   *
     Paper submission: 19 October 2020
   *
     Author notification: 18 January 2021
   *
     Final version: ??15 February 2021
   *
     Publication (presumably): end of March 2021

Details:

   *
     Papers have to be written in LaTex and adhere to the style
     requirements of LIPIcs
     <http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors>.

   *
     The recommended length of a paper is 12-15 pages, excluding
     front-page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, ...),
     bibliography and an appendix of max 5 pages. Longer submissions will
     not be considered.
   *
     Papers have to be submitted in pdf through EasyChair:
