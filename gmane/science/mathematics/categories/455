From: Daniel J. Yoder <dyoder@tazent.com>

My name is Daniel Yoder. I am very interested in learning about Category

Theory -- I have in fact purchased a little booklet by a Benjamin C.
Pierce entitled "Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists" -- as
part of a software engineering project I am working on. The project
started out as an attempt to address my frustrations with existing
commercial object-oriented programming tools, like those for Smalltalk
and C++. I had been developing the outlines of a "methodology" for
describing logical domain models, which could perhaps be loosely
compared to an (explicitly) object-oriented version of the Z language. I
say loosely
because my formal algebra background is very weak. At any rate,
eventually I began translating these abstractions into a C++ library and

I wanted to see if there wasn't a more formal basis to proceed from.
This idea was particularly compelling because I am dealing with a
synthesis of functional programming abstractions, a rich object model
(which includes my own conception of a category which appears to be
vaguely
related to the formal one), and graphs (which I was using for
representing the model). Presently, my goals are quite modest but I have

found it difficult to develop an approach based on existing research
because I lack the appropriate mathematical background. So the question
is: are there any attempts to map category theory
(or type theory or set theory -- I am not sure where the boundaries are)

to applications (versus theory per se), roughly analagous to Z or VDM,
that might be comprehensible to somewhat without the formal framework?
If not, is there a sequence of study you would recommend for proceeding?

I have an undergraduate degree and have done some reading about formal
algebra and category theory, but I am not sure of the path from the
former to the latter, or if that is, in fact, the appropriate path. Any
assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your
consideration.
