                      CALL FOR PAPERS


                         ICGT 2004

                 2nd International Conference
                   on Graph Transformation

           Roma (Italy), September 28 - October 2, 2004


The second International Conference on Graph Transformation ICGT 2004,
along with several satellite events, will be held in Roma at the end
of September 2004. It follows the first ICGT 2002 (Barcelona, October
2002) and a series of six international workshops on graph
transformation with applications in computer science held from 1978 to
1998 in Europe and the USA. The conference takes place under the
auspices of EATCS, EASST, and IFIP WG 1.3.  The proceedings will
appear in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series by
Springer-Verlag.
The conference is co-located with IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages
and Human Centric Computing (VL/HCC) September 26-29, 2004.


Scope.  Graphical structures of various kinds (like graphs, diagrams,
visual sentences and others) are very useful to describe complex
structures and systems in a direct and intuitive way. These structures
are often augmented by formalisms which add to the static description
a further dimension modelling the evolution of systems via any kind of
transformation of such graphical structures. The field of Graph
Transformation is concerned with the theory, applications and
implementation issues of all these formalisms.

The theory is strongly related to areas such as graph theory and graph
algorithms, formal language and parsing theory, theory of concurrency
and distributed systems, formal specification and verification, logic
and semantics. The application areas include all those fields of
Computer Science, Information Processing, Engineering and Natural
Sciences.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following.

On the more theoretical side:

- General models of graph transformation
- Node-, edge-, and hyperedge replacement graph grammars
- Concurrency, distribution, and formal semantics
- Term graph rewriting
- Network computing
- High-level replacement systems
- Hierarchical graphs and decompositions of graphs
- Logic expression of graph transformation properties
- Graph theoretical properties of graph languages
- Geometrical and topological aspects of graph transformation
- Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages
- Analysis of graph transformation systems
- Structuring and modularization concepts
- Semantics of UML and other visual modelling techniques

On the more applied side:

- Specification languages
- Implementation of programming languages
- Design of visual programming environments
- Massively parallel computing
- Bioinformatics
- Software engineering and modular systems
- Development of meta CASE tools
- Software architecture
- Information security
- Visual languages
- Bio-computing
- Actor systems and Petri nets
- Rule- and knowledge-based systems
- Pattern generation and picture processing
- Pattern matching
- Tool support
- Graph exchange formats
- Layout algorithms
