Two major things I learned from Albrecht Dold. One was the Dod-Kan=20
theorem, on the equivalence between chain complexes and simplicial=20
abelian groups, which was a major input to my doctoral thesis on the=20
finding k-invariants  of function spaces; and second,  when in the 1960s=20
he was lecturing at Liverpool on half-exact functors, I realised that=20
for publication purposes on this material,  I could cut out long and =20
detailed formulae for a homotopy equivalence making a diagram=20
commutative, since its existence followed from naturality!

Both of these aspects have continued to influence my work on crossed=20
complexes and nonabelian algebraic topology.
