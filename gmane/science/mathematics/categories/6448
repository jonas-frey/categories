           CALL FOR PAPERS AND WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

                        CSL 2011
                20th Annual Conference of the
     European Association for Computer Science Logic
                      Bergen, Norway
                   September 12-15, 2011

GENERAL INFORMATION

    Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the
    European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL).
    The conference is intended for computer scientists whose
    research activities involve logic, as well as for logicians
    working on issues significant for computer science.
    The Ackermann Award for 2011 will be presented to the
    recipients at CSL 2011.


SCOPE

    Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
    - automated deduction and interactive theorem proving
    - constructive mathematics and type theory
    - equational logic and term rewriting
    - automata and games, game semantics
    - modal and temporal logic
    - model checking
    - decision procedures
    - logical aspects of computational complexity
    - finite model theory
    - computational proof theory
    - logic programming and constraints
    - lambda calculus and combinatory logic
    - domain theory,
    - categorical logic and topological semantics
    - database theory
    - specification, extraction and transformation of programs
    - logical foundations of programming paradigms
    - logical aspects of quantum computing
    - verification and program analysis
    - linear logic
    - higher-order logic
    - nonmonotonic reasoning

PROCEEDINGS

    The proceedings will be published in the series LIPIcs,
    Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics.
    Each paper accepted by the Program Committee (PC) must be
    presented at the conference by one of the authors,
    and a final copy must be prepared according to LIPIcs guidelines
    (http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/).

PAPER SUBMISSION

    Authors are invited to submit papers of not more than 15 pages
    in LIPIcs style presenting work not previously published.
    Papers are to be submitted through EasyChair:
    http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=csl2011. Submitted papers
    must be in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the PC to
    assess the merits of the paper. Full proofs may appear in a technical
    appendix which will be read at the reviewers' discretion.
    Authors are strongly encouraged to include a well written intro-
    duction which is directed at all members of the program committee.
    Submission is in two phases with dates as given below.
    Papers must not be submitted concurrently to another conference with
    refereed proceedings; The PC chair should be informed of closely
    related work submitted to a conference or journal by March 19, 2011.
    Papers authored or coauthored by members of the PC are not allowed.

WORKSHOPS

    Proposals for satellite workshops on more specialized topics are
    welcome and can be sent to csl11@eacsl.org
