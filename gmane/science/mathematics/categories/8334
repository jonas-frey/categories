Dear Bob,

This is very unexpected and sad news indeed.

Without him knowing, Dietmar was one of my early heroes when, under the
direction of Nico Pumpluen, I started my Master's thesis project on
algebraic theories and monads in early 1970. His paper on
"Minimale und maximale Tripelerzeugende und eine Bemerkung zur
Tripelbarkeit" ("Minimal and maximal generators for triples and a
remark on tripleability")
had just appeared in Arch. Math. (1969), and I felt very lucky when
shortly afterwards I got hold of a copy of his Ph. D. thesis written
under the direction of the general algebraist Walter Felscher at the
University of Freiburg, on which the Archiv article was based.

I think that it was only in the 1980s that I first met Dietmar. When I
told him then how much his Ph. D. thesis had helped me organize my
Master's thesis, he replied "Ach, das war doch alles nur trivialer
Quatsch" ("Oh, that was all just trivial nonsense").

He was so talented and knowledgeable and yet so modest that he just
couldn't ever admit to having done something important or beautiful!

He'll be missed by many of us!

Walter
