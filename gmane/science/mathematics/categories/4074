I recently noticed that in Abstract no. 652-4 in the Notices
of the AMS volume 14 (1967) page 937, John Gray advocates a
systematic treatment of the calculus of comma categories
and lists five operations which should be explicitly accounted
for in such a calculus.
He also mentions that Jon Beck contributed to that discussion.

Probably John Gray's notes, if they still exist, would be
a helpful guide to someone planning to write a systematic
treatment as suggested recently Uwe Wolters.
