Dear colleagues,

Please see below the call for papers for the conference "Algebraic
Methodology and Software Technology" (AMAST).  AMAST has always been
happy to include category theoretic papers (indeed Bill Lawvere was
among the first AMAST invited speakers).

Now for the apology:  I can usually adjust the scheduling of AMAST to
avoid clashes with the CT meetings, but the dates for AMAST2010 were
set a year ago, and sadly clash with the Genoa meeting.
Nevertheless, if some of you are unable to attend CT and might be
able to be in North America at the time, AMAST is well worth
considering.

Please also distribute this announcement to colleagues who might be
able to attend.

Best wishes, Michael Johnson.

CALL FOR PAPERS
AMAST 2010: 13th International Conference on
Algebraic Methodology And Software Technology
http://mpc-amast2010.fsg.ulaval.ca/
Paper Submissions: 26th February 2010
---------------------------------------------

AMAST 2010
June 23th - 26th, 2010
Manoir St-Castin, Quebec City, Canada.


The major goal of the AMAST Conferences is to promote research that may
lead to the setting of software technology on a firm, mathematical
basis. This goal is achieved by a large international cooperation with
contributions from both academia and industry. The virtues of a software
technology developed on a mathematical basis include the provision
of software that is (a) correct, and the correctness can be proved
mathematically, (b) safe, so that it can be used in the implementation
of critical systems, (c) portable, i.e., independent of computing
platforms and language generations, and (d) evolutionary, i.e., it can
be self-adaptable and evolves with the problem domain.

All previous editions of the AMAST Conference, which were held
at Iowa City (1989,1991), Twente (1993), Montreal (1995), Munich (1996),
Sydney (1997), Manaus (1999), Iowa City (2000), Reunion Island (2002),
Stirling (2004), Saaremaa (2006) and Urbana-Champaign (2008),
made contributions to the AMAST goals by reporting and disseminating
academic and industrial achievements within the AMAST area of
interest. During these meetings, AMAST attracted an international
following among researchers and practitioners interested in software
technology, programming methodology and their algebraic and logical
foundations.


TOPICS
------
As in previous years, we invite papers reporting original research
on setting software technology on a firm mathematical basis. We expect
two kinds of submissions: technical papers and system demonstrations.
Of particular interest is research on using algebraic, logic, and other
formalisms suitable as foundations for software technology, as well as
software technologies developed by means of logic and algebraic
methodologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to,
the following:

SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY:

    * systems software technology
    * application software technology
    * concurrent and reactive systems
    * formal methods in industrial software development
    * formal techniques for software requirements, design
    * evolutionary software/adaptive systems

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY:

    * logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms
    * constraint programming and concurrency
    * program verification and transformation
    * programming calculi
    * specification languages and tools
    * formal specification and development case studies

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS:

    * logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra
    * algebraic foundations for languages and systems, coinduction
    * theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning
    * logics of programs
    * algebra and coalgebra

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers):

    * software development environments
    * support for correct software development
    * system support for reuse
    * tools for prototyping
    * component based software development tools
    * validation and verification
    * computer algebra systems
    * theorem proving systems


PUBLICATION
-----------
As in the past, the proceedings of AMAST 2010 will be published by
Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

We invite prospective authors to submit electronically previously
unpublished papers of high quality. Submissions should not have been
published and should not be under consideration for publication
elsewhere.  Papers must be no longer than 15 pages (6 pages for
system demonstrations) and should be prepared using LaTeX and the
LNCS style that can be downloaded from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

Papers should be received by February 26, 2010.



IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
* Paper submissions: February 26, 2010
* Notification of paper acceptance: March 19, 2010
* Camera ready papers due: April 5, 2010
* AMAST'2010 Conference: June 23-26, 2010


LOCATION
--------
The conference will be held at the Manoir St-Castin, Quebec City, Canada
