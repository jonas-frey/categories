Let me remind all people on the category list that a boycott of all 
conferences held in the US is being proposed and I will not go to any.

Dear all,

This is a reminder that from June 4-10, 2017, there will be a workshop
on Homotopy Type Theory, organized as part of the AMS Mathematics
Research Communities program and held in the Snowbird Resort in Utah.

The goal of the workshop is to bring together advanced graduate
students and postdocs having some background in one (or more) areas
such as algebraic topology, category theory, mathematical logic, or
computer science, with the goal of learning how these areas come
together in homotopy type theory, and working together to prove new
results. Basic knowledge of just one of these areas will be sufficient
to be a successful participant. The organizers are particularly
interested in using this workshop as an opportunity to improve the
diversity in the HoTT community in all aspects.

For more information about the workshop, including the list of sample
topics that participants may be working on and the registration
information, please see the website:

http://www.ams.org/programs/research-communities/2017MRC-1

All accepted into the program will receive financial support (room and
board at the Snowbird Resort and up to $650 towards airfare). The
application deadline is *March 1st, 2017.*

The majority of the positions are allocated to U.S. citizens and
people who are affiliated with U.S. institutions, but a smaller number
are also open to international participants.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact any of the organizers.

Dan Christensen, Chris Kapulkin, Dan Licata, Emily Riehl, Mike Shulman
