Dear Colleagues,

Macquarie University is currently offering a PhD scholarship to support a
student to study Category Theory as a member of its Centre of Australian
Category Theory (CoACT).

This scholarship covers the full cost of tuition and provides a full-time
stipend of AU$22,500pa tax exempt for 3 and a half years. Furthermore, the
University supports all of its PhD students via a generous grant pool, whic=
h
in mathematics typically provides support for travel to international
conferences.

This particular PhD studentship forms part of an Australian Research Counci=
l
Discovery Grant funded project entitled =93Applicable Categorical Structure=
s=94,
investigators E/Prof. Ross Street, A/Prof. Dominic Verity, A/Prof. Stephen
Lack and Prof. Michael Johnson (DP1094883). An overview summary of this
project is provided below.

Details of Macquarie's PhD scholarship program and its application process
may be found at

http://www.hdr.mq.edu.au/information_about/scholarships

and more information about CoACT and its Australian Category Theory Seminar
may be found at:

http://web.science.mq.edu.au/groups/coact/ and
http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/AusCat/index.html

The application formalities are that applicants will need to complete a
candidature/scholarship application form, which should quote the allocation
reference number 2010233, and arrange for two academic referee reports to b=
e
submitted to Macquarie University's Higher Degree Research Office.

In the first instance, however, students who are interested in applying for
this scholarship should email Dominic Verity at dominic.verity@mq.edu.au no=
t
later than the 31st of August 2010.

Regards

Dom

Project Name: Applicable Categorical Structures

Project Description:

We might view category theory as a discipline shaped by two dominant
mathematical and philosophical themes, these being the study of internal
structures and the process of categorification. The first of these
encourages us to think of certain constructs called categories as being aki=
n
to universes of discourse in which mathematical structures and arguments ma=
y
be formulated. The second suggests that we might fruitfully replace
underlying sets of our mathematical entities themselves by certain kinds of
categories and their operations and equations by functors and coherent
equivalences. This project seeks to further study the applicability of thes=
e
complementary views of category theory, by (a) studying the interplay
between internal structures, externalisation and categorification at low
dimensions in a unified framework (b) extending certain of these results to
the context of higher weak category theory and (c) applying these methods t=
o
certain foundational problems in K-theory, mathematical physics and compute=
r
science.

Other Important information:

This is a broadly based, interdisciplinary project which would suit a
student who possesses a strong interest and background in pure mathematics,
mathematical physics and/or theoretical computer science. We would generall=
y
expect that applicants for this scholarship would have some background in
category theory and its applications. However, depending upon the candidate
this may not be a mandatory requirement.
