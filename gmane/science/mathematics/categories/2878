Even more ancient:

Parallel transport in fibre spaces," Bol. Soc. Mat. Mexicana (1968), 68-86.

Unfortunately that's a hard paper to get a hold of

somewhat related is

Associated fibre spaces," Michigan Math. Journal 15 (1968), 457-470.

and at the survey level

 H-spaces and classifying spaces, I-IV", AMS Proc. Symp. Pure Math.
22 (1971), 247-272.

Of course, as you might expect, I describe things in terms of
A_\infty-morphisms
from the space of loops into

Aut(F) of homotopy equivalences of $F$

Now that some of us are comfortable with A_\infty-cats,
categborification should proceed
perhaps with some technical details.
