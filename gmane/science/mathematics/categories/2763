to establish synergies between the concurrency and programming=20
language communities working on the theory and practice of SOS.=20

The workshop will also mark the publication of a special issue of=20
the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming, devoted to SOS.=20
Together with original research papers on SOS, this special issue=20
will feature a definitive version of Gordon Plotkin's 1981 DAIMI memo=20
on SOS, together with a piece by Plotkin on the origins of SOS.=20

Preliminary Scientific Programme:

* Andrew Pitts:  Equivariant and Nominal SOS (invited talk) =20
* David Sands  Representing and Manipulating Contexts: a Tool for=20
    Operational Reasoning (tutorial)  =20
* Matthias Mann  Congruence of Bisimulation in a Non-Deterministic=20

* Rob van Glabbeek  The Meaning of Negative Premises: Part II=20
   (tutorial)
* Olivier Tardieu A Deterministic Logical Semantics for Esterel =20
* Peter Mosses  Modular Structural Operational Semantics  =20
* Marija Kulas   Toward the Concept of Backtracking Computation  =20
* Ralf Laemmel  Evolution Scenarios for Language-based Functionality =20

Sponsorship:=20

The workshop is partly sponsored by the Engineering and Physical=20
Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).=20

Student Grants:=20

Thanks to the support of the EPSRC, we have fifteen small grants
available to the U.K.-based PhD students to attend the SOS workshop.
A typical grant will cover the costs of travel and subsistence, and=20
in special cases the accommodation for one night in London. Full
details on how to apply will soon appear on the workshop Web pages
but, in short, if you are a PhD student researching at the U.K.-based=20
academic institution, you can apply for the grant by emailing=20

1. Full name
2. Affiliation
3. Topic of research
4. Supervisor's details
5. Estimate of cost of travel and accommodation (if really necessary)
6. Short statement on how the SOS Workshop will benefit your
   present and future research

We also recommend that you supply us with a short supporting letter=20
