                                Call for Papers

          15th Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation
                                (WoLLIC 2008)
                             Edinburgh, Scotland
                               July 1-4, 2008
                 (There will be a screening of George Csicsery's
                 "Julia Robinson and Hilbert's Tenth Problem"
                 http://zalafilms.com/films/juliarobinson.html
                 with kind permission of the film director)

     WoLLIC is an annual international forum on inter-disciplinary resear=
ch
     involving formal logic, computing and programming theory, and natura=
l
     language and reasoning.  Each meeting includes invited talks and
     tutorials as well as contributed papers.

     The Fifteenth WoLLIC will be held in Edinburgh, Scotland, from
     July 1 to July 4, 2008. It is sponsored by the Association for
     Symbolic Logic (ASL), the Interest Group in Pure and Applied Logics
     (IGPL), the European Association for Logic, Language and Information
     (FoLLI), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science
     (EATCS), the Sociedade Brasileira de Computacao (SBC), and the
     Sociedade Brasileira de Logica (SBL).

PAPER SUBMISSION
     Contributions are invited on all pertinent subjects, with particular
     interest in cross-disciplinary topics.  Typical but not exclusive
     areas of interest are: foundations of computing and programming;
     novel computation models and paradigms; broad notions of proof and
belief;
     formal methods in software and hardware development; logical approac=
h to
     natural language and reasoning; logics of programs, actions and
resources;
     foundational aspects of information organization, search, flow, shar=
ing,
     and protection.
     Proposed contributions should be in English, and consist of a schola=
rly
     exposition accessible to the non-specialist, including motivation,
     background, and comparison with related works.
     They must not exceed 10 pages (in font 10 or higher), with up to
     5 additional pages for references and technical appendices.
     The paper's main results must not be published or submitted
     for publication in refereed venues, including journals and other
     scientific meetings.
     It is expected that each accepted paper be presented at the meeting =
by
     one of its authors.
     Papers must be submitted electronically at
     www.cin.ufpe.br/~wollic/wollic2008/instructions.html
     A title and single-paragraph abstract should be submitted by
     February 24, and the full paper by March 2 (firm date).
     Notifications are expected by April 13, and final papers for
     the proceedings will be due by April 27 (firm date).

PROCEEDINGS
     The proceedings of WoLLIC 2008, including both invited and contribut=
ed
     papers, will be published in advance of the meeting as a volume in
     Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (tbc).  In addition,
     abstracts will be published in the Conference Report section of
     the Logic Journal of the IGPL, and selected contributions will
     be published as a special post-conference WoLLIC 2008 issue of the
     Journal of Logic and Computation (tbc).
