CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on Semantic Spaces at the Intersection of NLP, Physics, and =
Cognitive Sciences

https://sites.google.com/view/semspace2020/home =
<https://sites.google.com/view/semspace2020/home>=20

Co-located with ESSLLI 2020 (https://www.esslli.eu/ =
<https://www.esslli.eu/>)

August 8th and 9th 2020
Utrecht, The Netherlands

****

AIMS AND SCOPE
Vector embeddings of word meanings have become a mainstream tool in =
large scale natural language processing tools. The use of vectors to =
represent meanings in semantic spaces or feature spaces is also employed =
in cognitive science. Unrelated to natural language and cognitive =
science, vectors and vector spaces have been extensively used as models =
of physical theories and especially the theory of quantum mechanics. =
Crucial similarities between the vector representations of quantum =
mechanics and those of natural language are exhibited via bicompact =
linear logic and compact closed categorical structures in natural =
language.

Exploiting the common ground provided by vector spaces, the proposed =
workshop will bring together researchers working at the intersection of =
NLP, cognitive science, and physics, offering to them an appropriate =
forum for presenting their uniquely motivated work and ideas. The =
interplay between these three disciplines will foster theoretically =
motivated approaches to understanding how meanings of words interact =
with each other in sentences and discourse via grammatical types, how =
they are determined by input from the world, and how word and sentence =
meanings interact logically.

Topics of interest include (but are not restricted to):
Reasoning in semantic spaces
Compositionality in semantic spaces and conceptual spaces
Conceptual spaces in linguistics and natural language processing
Applications of quantum logic in natural language processing and =
cognitive science
Modelling functional words such as prepositions and relative pronouns in =
compositional distributional models of meaning
Diagrammatic reasoning for natural language processing and cognitive =
science
Modelling so-called =E2=80=98non-compositional=E2=80=99 phenomena such =
as metaphor

SPECIAL SESSION
We will have a special session on the relevance of formal grammar =
methods in deep learning and other statistical and vector space =
approaches to language. Examples of phenomena where these methods come =
into play include (but of course are not limited to) anaphora =
resolution, long-range filler-gap dependencies, function-argument =
relations, locality domains, and syntactic structures in general. This =
session is organised jointly with the Formal Grammar conference =
(http://fg.phil.hhu.de/2020/ <http://fg.phil.hhu.de/2020/>)

SUBMISSIONS:
There are *two separate routes* for submission: either to the Formal =
Grammar shared session or to the main SEMSPACE workshop.

Submission to the shared session with Formal Grammar should adhere to =
the submission guidelines at =
http://fg.phil.hhu.de/2020/#Submission_Details =
<http://fg.phil.hhu.de/2020/#Submission_Details>. Note that the deadline =
for the special session is 15th March 2020.

Submission to the main SEMSPACE workshop: Electronic submission of =
original contributions (up to 16 pages) of previously unpublished work. =
Submission of substantial, albeit partial results of work in progress is =
welcomed.

Extended abstracts (3 pages) of previously published work that is recent =
and relevant to the workshop. These should include a link to a =
separately published paper or preprint.

Contributions should be submitted at:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsemspace2020 =
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsemspace2020>

A special issue of selected extended papers will be prepared following =
the workshop. Only original contributions will be considered for =
publication.

Please send any queries to semspace2020@easychair.org =

IMPORTANT DATES:
Paper submission to shared session with Formal Grammar: 15th March 2020
Paper submission to SEMSPACE main workshop: 24th April 2020
Notification to contributors (SEMSPACE main workshop): 1st June 2020
Workshop dates: 8th-9th August 2020
