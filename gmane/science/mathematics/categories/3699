Hi

You might be interested in the Masters thesis I wrote in 1980 called
"Epimorphisms in Algebraic and Some Other Categories", which might have
some relevant information in it for you.  You can get it from the McGill
University library, or from Library and Archives Canada, or I can email
you a copy if you wish.
