Second Announcement:

Thematic mini-school
'Modern Perspectives in Homotopy Theory: Infinity Categories, Infinity
Operads and Homotopy Type Theory,'  10-13 April 2012
In Swansea, UK

(Funded by grants from the EPSRC and the LMS)

Registration deadline: 16 March

http://maths.swan.ac.uk/staff/jhg/minischool2012/index.html

The programme will consist of lecture mini-courses aimed at
postgraduate and early career researchers.  The lectures will start
from a basic knowledge of simplicial sets and proceed to current
frontiers.

Speakers:
Prof Ieke Moerdijk (Nijmegen)
Dr David Gepner (Regensburg)
Dr Michael Shulman (UC San Diego)

Postgraduate funding:
We have some limited funds available to partially cover the
accommodation costs of postgraduates attending the event.

Background:
In the past decade homotopy theory and higher category theory have
increasingly become essential tools in an ever expanding list of
fields of mathematics.  These tools have also shown their importance
in parts of computer science and logic.

The first strand of the mini-school will be the Lurie-Joyal theory of
infinity categories.  It is a profoundly important foundation for
homotopy theory, higher category theory, and derived algebraic
geometry.  Infinity categories are central to Lurie's proof of the
Baez-Dolan cobordism hypothesis, they are becoming increasingly
important in representation theory such as through recent developments
in the Geometric Langlands Programme, and they also play a role in the
Fukaya Categories of Kontsevich's Homological Mirror Symmetry
Conjectures.  This area has been progressing extremely rapidly in the
recent years and there is a need for many young researchers to learn
it.

The second strand will be Voevodsky's type-theoretic univalent
foundations.  Type theory sits at an intersection of mathematics,
logic and computer science.  Voevodsky, after winning a Fields Medal
for his work bringing homotopy theory to algebraic geometry, has since
2005 focused on constructing a profound new foundation for mathematics
through an interplay between homotopy theory and type theory.  This is
an exciting new subject that deserves attention.
