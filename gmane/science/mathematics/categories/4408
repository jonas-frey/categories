The workshop

Deep Inference, its Algebra, Geometry and Syntax

Will be held in Nancy, France on June 18 2008.

As the title implies the main theme of the workshop is deep
inference, but talks on related subjects like the the improvement and
abstract theory of proof formalisms are most welcome.

The workshop will be held at the Loria computer science lab on
Wednesday June 18 2008, starting at 10:30, so as to ensure an easy
commute from Paris (there is a Paris-Nancy TGV that leaves Gare de
l'Est at 8:12 and the last return train leaves Nancy at 20:15).

contains a few more details, including suggestions for accomodation.
Please contact me if you intend to attend and/or give a talk.
