[The RTG includes PhD topics that may be of interest to readers of the
categories list, with Stefan Milius and Lutz Schr??der as possible PhD
advisers.]

The Department of Computer Science and the School of Law at FAU invite
applications for



10 PhD positions (m/f/d)

(salary level 13 TV-L) in Computer Science (full time) and Law (part
time, 75%)



and



1 postdoctoral position at the School of Law (m/f/d)

(salary level 13 TV-L, full time)



within the Research Training Group 2475 "Cybercrime and Forensic
Computing" funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) commencing on
October 1, 2019.



The Research Training Group aims to systematically analyse research
questions arising from the interaction between computer science and
criminal law. The principal investigators of this project offer
expertise in the following areas:



o Computer security, digital forensic science

o Criminal law, criminal procedure, criminology

o Theoretical computer science (logic, semantics, automata)

o Pattern recognition, image processing, image forensics

o Cryptography

o Hardware-software-co-design



More information about possible research topics can be found at
https://cybercrime.fau.de



Applicants should have an excellent academic record, hold an MSc, LL.M.
or an equivalent university degree in computer science, law or related
disciplines, and have the goal to finish a PhD degree within three
years. Applicants for the postdoctoral position should hold a PhD in law.



FAU aims to increase the number of women in scientific positions. Female
candidates are therefore particularly encouraged to apply. In case of
equal qualifications, candidates with disabilities will take precedence.



Please submit your complete application documents by 12.6.2019 to
cybercrime-applications@fau.de. Please mention in your application at
least two research areas from the above list which you are specifically
interested in. Interviews will commence between 3.7.2019 and 12.7.2019
in Erlangen. Further inquiries can be directed to Felix Freiling
(felix.freiling@fau.de) regarding positions in computer science and Hans
Kudlich (hans.kudlich@fau.de) regarding positions in law.
