Dear All,

I would like to invite applications for a fully-funded PhD position in
the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, UK.
The PhD student will work me on topics related to categorical semantics
of programming languages and computer theorem proving.
Students broadly interested in these fields of research are strongly
encouraged to apply. Topics of particular interest are:

* Syntax and semantics of type theory
* Formalisation of mathematics in univalent foundations
* Directed type theory
* Algebraic specification of programming languages

Applicants should hold, or be about to obtain, a Masters or Bachelor
degree in Computer Science or Mathematics.

The PhD position is fully funded, covering tuition fees and a tax-free
scholarship. Healthcare is provided for free.

Please, do not hesitate to contact me by email for further details:
b.ahrens@cs.bham.ac.uk
In addition, feel free to browse my webpage for
more information on my research interests:
https://benediktahrens.net

The theory group at Birmingham's School of Computer Science is very
active, organising regular seminars and informal meetings. Many relevant
international events frequently take place in Birmingham such as YaMCATS
category theory seminar, Midlands Graduate School, and Workshops on
Univalent Mathematics. For more information see
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/.

Information on how to apply is given on
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-research/. However,
interested candidates are strongly encouraged to contact me in the first
instance.

Benedikt Ahrens
