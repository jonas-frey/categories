Dear Richard,=0A=
=0A=
You are almost right. Except that the notion of non-transitive torsor =0A=
should be made explicit. I would say that a right G-set E=0A=
is a *non-transitive torsor* if the action of G on E is free.=0A=
Equivalently, if E is a G-torsor over E/G.  =0A=
With this notion, the  classifying topos for right free G-action=0A=
is the topos of *covariant* set valued functors on=0A=
the category of finitely generated free G^op-sets.=0A=
=0A=
A non-transitive G-torsor E can be viewed as a family =0A=
of G-torsors indexed by E/G. In general, if a topos $mathcal{E}$=0A=
classifies the models of a geometric theory T, there is=0A=
another topos $mathcal{E}$ which classifies variable families=0A=
of models of T: it is the *bagdomain* of $mathcal{E}$=0A=
introduced by Johnstone. See the Elephant vol. I Proposition 4.4.16.=0A=

Dear categorists,=0A=
=0A=
If G is a group, then [G,Set] is the classifying topos for right=0A=
G-torsors.=0A=
=0A=
What about the classifying topos for possibly non-transitive torsors?=0A=
=0A=
I'm not very adept at these calculations, but if I construct it as a=0A=
subtopos of the classifying topos for G^op-sets, it appears to come out=0A=
as [X,Set] where X is the category of finitely presentable, free,=0A=
non-empty G^op-sets.=0A=
=0A=
Similarly, if G is a groupoid, the corresponding classifying topos=0A=
appears to be [X,Set], where X is the full subcategory of [G^op, Set] on=0A=
those finite coproducts of representables which have global support.=0A=
=0A=
Is this correct?=0A=
=0A=
