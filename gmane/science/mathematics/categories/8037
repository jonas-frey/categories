Mmm ... More in keeping with Sammy's aesthetic might have been to suggest
You should not NEED to explain any PROOF of a theorem you prove -- that
is, the right proof will be completely self-explanatory.

But I don't think that, in all the years I was exposed to him, I ever
heard him say such a thing explicitly :-) .
