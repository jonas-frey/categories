CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS
 
METHODS FOR MODALITIES 2 (M4M-1)
 
Institute for Logic, Language and Computation
University of Amsterdam
November 29-30, 2001
www.science.uva.nl/~m4m
 
DEADLINE: October 12, 2001
 
THEME
The workshop Methods for Modalities' (M4M) aims to bring together
researchers interested in developing proof tools and reasoning methods for
modal logic broadly conceived, including description logic, hybrid logics,
feature logic, temporal logic, etc.
 
SPECIAL FEATURES
To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will be centered
around a number of long presentations by leading researchers; these
presentations aim to provide both the general background and inside
information in a number of key areas.  To complement these, we are inviting
submissions of short, focussed presentations aimed at highlighting new                      
developments, and submissions of system demonstrations.  M4M-2 is the second
installment of this bi-anual workshop series.
 
SUBMISSIONS
We invite two kinds of submissions: research papers on proof tools and
reasoning methods for modal logic as well as their applications; and system
descriptions.  Research papers need not be original; they can be up to 10
A4 size pages, and system descriptions can be up to 4 A4 size pages.
System descriptions should focus on actual implementations, explaining
system architecture issues and specific implementation techniques.  Every
system description should be accompanied by a system demo at M4M.  The
primary means of submission will be electronic, in PostScript format.
Submissions should be sent to m4m@science.uva.nl.
 
PROGRAM COMMITTEE
The program committee for M4M consists of
  Carlos Areces (ILLC, The Netherlands),
  Stephane Demri (LSV, ENS de Cachan and Lab. LEIBNIZ, France),
  Joseph Halpern (Cornell University, USA),
  Ian Horrocks (University of Manchester, United Kingdom) [to be confirmed],
  Joost-Pieter Katoen (University of Twente, The Netherlands),
  Maarten de Rijke (ILLC, The Netherlands),
  Holger Schlingloff (University of Bremen, Germany),
  Renate Schmidt (University of Manchester, United Kingdom).
 
IMPORTANT DATES
 * Deadline for submissions: October 12, 2001
 * Notification: November 5, 2001
 * Workshop dates: November 29-30, 2001
