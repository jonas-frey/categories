Dear Andrej,

Conventional functional analysis is largely concerned with Banach=20
spaces, and there's certainly alot that can be said about the=20
category of Banach spaces and linear contractions (i.e., continuous=20
linear transformations with norm less-than-or-equal-to 1). =20

For example, it is symmetric monoidal closed (with internal hom,=20
the space of _all_ continuous linear transformations!) and locally=20
countably presentable.  In fact, it is a countable-ary quasi-variety,=20
and the full subcategory of its finite-dimensional objects is a good=20
example of a *-autonomous category that is not compact closed. =20
[Although it is not hard to prove the latter directly, it can also=20
be seen as an interesting application of Robin Houston's theorem=20
that products and coproducts can not differ in a compact closed=20
category.] =20

In fact, I think Ban is a fine example which can teach any student=20
of category theory a number of salutary lessons:
  1. in category theory, the meaning of isomorphism is fixed---so if=20
you have a pre-existing class of isomorphisms in mind (in this case,=20
the isometric (norm-preserving) isomorphisms), then you must take=20
care in choosing an appropriate class of morphisms;
  2a. there's more to defining internal homs than just slapping an =20
extra structure on the external homs;=20
  2b. forgetful functors don't have to be "the obvious thing";
  3. you can't always have your cake and eat it too!---the whole=20
category can not hope to be self-dual, precisely because it is=20
locally presentable (and not a poset).

Of course there are also (unital) C*-algebras, and I can make an=20
interesting point about them too---sometimes one needs to consider=20
maps between C*-algebras which are not *-homomorphisms: for example,
there are "completely positive maps" and "completely bounded maps".
Now, as important as the b.o./f.f. factorisation may be in general,=20
it seems fishy to speak of a category whose objects are C*-algebras
but whose morphisms preserve only part of the C*-algebraic structure;
and so it was that analysts were led to develop the notions of=20
"operator space" and "operator system" which provide the correct=20
level of structure to define c.b. maps and c.p. maps, respectively. =20
In fact, these are quite interesting categories in their own right:
operator spaces are said to model "non-commutative functional analysis"
---but I only have a tenuous grasp of what that is supposed to mean!

I meant to discuss quantale theory and Banach sheaves too, but I've
run out of time---perhaps someone else will pick up the thread.

Cheers,
Jeff.
