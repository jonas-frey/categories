I remember Henry Whitehead said that he was very impressed by the axioms
for a category in the Eilenberg-Mac Lane paper.

A curiosity about the definition is that groupoids were defined by
Brandy in 1926, and this definition was used by the Chicago school of
algebra and applied to ring theory.  Bill Cockcroft told me that the
groupoid notion was an influence.  In 1985 I asked Eilenberg about this,
and said no, since if it had been, they would have used it as an
example! I forgot to ask Mac Lane!
