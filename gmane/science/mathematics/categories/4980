When I lecture on category theory to first-year graduate students, I
tell them there are two things they should remember about the
Yoneda Lemma: it isn't a lemma, and it was never published by Yoneda.
In this respect it resembles that bulwark of the British constitution,
the Lord Privy Seal (who is none of the three things that his title
claims).
