Ah, thanks, that's exactly the sort of explanation I was hoping for.
And after I sent my message, I thought that Gaeta's notes might be
relevant (they cam be found at
http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/FuncAlg.pdf)

Thanks also to those that responded privately. Thomas Holder in
particular pointed to further messages from Lawvere reproduced at

http://mathoverflow.net/a/52894/4177

in the context of the general concept of Nullstellensatz.

Best regards,

David
