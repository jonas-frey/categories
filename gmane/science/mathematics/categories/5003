Eduard Cech center had been established in 2005 as the national research
center focusing its attention to interactions between algebra, geometry, and
logic (and their applications in cryptology, computer science, etc.). It
is jointly operated by mathematicians from Masaryk University in Brno,
Charles University in Prague and Academy of Sciences of the Czech
Republic, with offices both in Brno and Prague.

The Center invites applications for several research positions
for the year 2010 commencing at the date depending on mutual agreement.
The candidates must be recent PhD's that obtained their degree not earlier
than 2 years before submitting this application.

Candidates should submit a letter of application accompanied by a CV,
list of publications and an outline of their research project to
Professor Jan Slovak (slovak@muni.cz) not later than August 10, 2009.
They should also arrange for at least 2 letters of recommendation (one can
be from a Czech mathematician) to be mailed directly to slovak@muni.cz
before August 20, 2009. The successful applicants will be notified as soon
as possible, we hope the decision will be taken by September 20, 2009.
