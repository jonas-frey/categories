Dear George

By a presentation in mathematics I mean generators and relations for an
algebraic structure of a certain kind. Occasionally we are fortunate to
have also another more direct description of the same algebra, which it is
useful to make explicit; a well known example of the usefulness of making
explicit such a conceptual (as opposed to syntactical) description is the
pair of definitions for the algebra of operators that defines the notion
of simplicial set.

In your 2001 book with Borceux, Definition 7.2.1 involves five generators
and five relations. Sometimes this is augmented by symmetry.

What is actually being presented ?  a certain full finite subcategory of
the category of finite sets. Why should diagrams of this shape occur so
often and be transported by functors even when they do not satisfy any
exactness ? That is especially evident in the case of the Amitsur complex
on page 264: the family of powers of a given object is a functor of the
exponents, which are sets from that little category.

That groupoids form a subcategory of the topos permits to take images, in
the topos, of maps between groupoids; surprisingly, that can be useful.

I prefer to consider one more finite set, so that "associativity" is a
structure even when it is not an exact property (and analogously in the
case of categories vs truncated simplicial sets - the question is how
truncated). Then to be a groupoid is just a pullback-preservation
condition.
