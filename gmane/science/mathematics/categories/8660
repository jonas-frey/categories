Philosophy of mathematics is still philosophy and has nothing to do with
mathematics, since philosophy does not adhere to any mathematical
principles.

Philosophy of logic is the same, since philosophy does not adhere to any
logical principles.

However, the logic of mathematics and the mathematics of logic is more
interesting in particular as a major part of informatics can learn from
logic.

It is somehow interesting that the philosophy of set theory is never on
any agenda, even if set theory, logic and mathematics is very much
intertwined. Early 20th century work and development in G??ttingen,
Vienna and Warsaw, and other places, of course, is often said to be very
well known, but surprisingly few actually still read work from that era.

Why, for instance, is it so clear that G??del's Incompleteness Theorem is
a "theorem" and not a "paradox"? After all, it is nothing but a bit more
subtle version of the Liar paradox. I paradox means Fix it!, whereas a
theorem means Don't touch!.

In logic, why do we make a giant leap from Aristotle (who was a
philosopher, not a logician) to Boole/Peano/Frege, ignoring whatever
happened logically in between? In math we don't do that.

Category theory can play a role in all this, in particular in more
strict definitions of the notion of logic. Type theory is good example,
where type constructors are still allowed to dangle around any formalism
adopted, and then something magic comes in from the outside and provides
a "solution". HoTT and its predecessors are doing that all the time.

The phrase "Philosophy of Practice of Mathematics & Informatics", I
guess, is as good as any variation  of it. WE could also debate about
the "Mathematical Practice of the Informatics of Philosophy", or the
"Informatics if Mathematics of Philosophy & Practice", or even the
"Mathematical Practice of Informatics without any interference
whatsoever of Philosophy".

Best,

Patrik
