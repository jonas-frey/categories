Dear Robert=2CPlease announce the following possibly important message in c=
ategories.=20
By some unfortunate coincidence=2C and without my being aware of=2C I have =
not been receiving any mail whatsoever=2C and for quite some undetermined t=
ime=2C either at my official departmental address=2C bunge@math.mcgill.ca=
=2C or at the no longer existing address bunge@triples.math.mcgill.ca=2C li=
sted however as mine in the Editorial Board of the Cahiers de Topologie et =
Geometrie Differentielle Categoriques. The first problem has now been fixed=
=2C and bunge@math.mcgill.ca is now a good address for me. I am worried of =
course about the mail that I have not received in that location since perha=
ps May 2009. If there has been anything important that any of you has sent =
me=2C please send again. The second problem will be fixed by changing the o=
bsolete address bunge@triples.math.mcgill.ca in the Cahiers=2C but only as =
of January 2010 when the new covers get printed. If anyone (in addition to =
the two cases that I now know about) has submitted a paper to me using the =
current Cahiers address=2C please resend but to bunge@math.mcgill.ca (witho=
ut the "triples"). You could also use my McGill University official address=
=2C that is=2C marta.bunge@mcgill.ca=2C which never had any problems. Thank=
 you and apologies for any inconvenience. Marta
