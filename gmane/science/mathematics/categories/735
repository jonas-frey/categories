A month or so ago, I got a note from Ross Street asking about my 1986
JPAA paper on representations of categories.  The main point of that
paper was to give a new, relatively simple proof of the full embedding
theorem for regular categories.  Unfortunately, I tried to get too
general and got tangled in the variance, so that the argument could not
be followed.  Follows is my final note to Ross.  The argument is really
quite simple and can be described as follows:

1. Show that when @C (read script C) is regular, so is Lex(@C,Set)\op.
 (Lex=FL is the finite limit preserving functors.  This result is really
the only new thing in the paper.)

2. Adapt Grothendieck's transfinite induction proof of the existence of
injectives in an AB5 abelian category to show that Lex(@C,Set)\op has
enough @C-projectives = regular functors.

3. Adapt Mitchell's proof of the abelian category full embedding theorem
to show that by taking a sufficiently large full subcategory @P in
Lex(@C,Set) consisting of regular functors, then the evaluation functor
@C --> Func(@P\op,Set) is full and faithful.

That's all there is to it.  I plan to post on triples in the next few
days a revised version of the paper (it was, fortunately, one of the
very first that was typed on a computer, so this is not too onerous).  I
will call it embedding.rev.

Ross further raised the question as to whether a transfinite induction
was too sophisticated for the classroom.  I don't know exactly what
level his course was, but I will say that if we never do a hard theorem,
then the students will come away with the idea that there is no depth to
category theory, an impression his colleagues will be only too happy to
affirm.  This argument of Grothendieck's is, after all, the first
example that there could be deep results in categories.

=====================================================================

Dear Ross:

I did not really try to understand my paper.  I suspect it is a matter
of trying to be too abstract and getting tangled in my own feet.  At any
rate, here is how I would do it for a class.  First, since you didn't
ask, I assume that you are happy with the fact that given a small
category @C (think of that as script C; BTW, I never noticed how
dreadful JPAA's scripts were), the category @L = Lex(@C,Set)\op has the
property that given any functor F, there is a regular epi P -->> F such
that P is projective with respect to regular epis in @C.  Now consider a
small full subcategory @P built out of choosing @C projective covers for
each representable and a @C-projective cover for the kernel pair of each
of the @C-projective covers of representables.  Thus, for each object C,
there is a parallel pair Q ===> P in @P, whose coequalizer in @L is C.
Notice that Hom_{@L}(P,C) = PC, using Yoneda and taking the variance
into account.

There is an obvious functor F: @C --> Fun(@P\op,Set) that takes C to
the functor P |--> Hom(P,C) = PC.  This functor is clearly
faithful, preserves finite limits and regular epis.  The only question
is the fullness.  So suppose a: FC --> FB is a natural transformation.
What naturality means is that for any d: Q --> P in @P, the square
                         Hom(d,C)
               Hom(P,C) ----------> Hom(Q,C)
                  |                    |
                  |                    |
               aP |                    | aQ
                  |                    |
                  |                    |
                  v                    v
               Hom(P,B) ----------> Hom(Q,B)
                         Hom(d,B)
 commutes.  Applied to an f: P --> C, this means that aQ(d.f) = d.aP(f).
Apply this in the case that f is a coequalizer in @L to a parallel pair
d,e : Q ===> P in @P.  It says that
     aP(f).d = aQ(f.d) = aQ(f.e) = aQ(f).e
 and that means that there is a unique b: C --> B such that aP(f) = b.f.
You finish the argument by observing that for any object R of @P and any
c: R --> C, there is a lifting to an arrow g: R --> P and then aR(c) =
aR(f.g) = aP(f).g = b.f.g = b.c.
