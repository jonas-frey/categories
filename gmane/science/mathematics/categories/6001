For concrete categories, this problem is addressed in the book
A. Pultr and V. Trnkova, Combinatorial, Algebraic and Topological
Representations of Groups, Semigroups and Categories, North-Holland 1980.
There is a locally small concrete category K containing all locally small
concrete categories as full subcategories (up to iso). Assuming
the non-existence of a proper class of measurable cardinals, we can
take the category Gra of graphs, or the category Smg of semigroups for K.=
=20
Without this set-theoretic axiom, both Gra and Smg contain all accessible=
=20
categories (i.e., all Grothendieck toposes) as full subcategories.
This can be found in my book (with J. Adamek) Locally Presentable=20
and Accessible Categories, Cambridge Univ. Press 1994
