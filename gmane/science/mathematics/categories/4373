Full Paper Submission   8th May, 6am BST
Author Notification     23rd June
Final Paper             21st July
Symposium              8th-10th September


Following on the success of the first International Symposium on
Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) held at Walworth Castle in 2006,
we are pleased to announce the second, to be held in Dublin in
September 2008. Based on the pioneering work on unifying theories of
programming of Tony Hoare, He Jifeng, and others, the aims of this
Symposium series are to continue to reaffirm the significance of the
ongoing UTP project, to encourage efforts to advance it by providing a
focus for the sharing of results by those already actively
contributing, and to raise awareness of the benefits of such unifying
theoretical frameworks among the wider computer science and software
engineering communities.

Of particular interest is how unification may be used to meet the goals
and difficulties to be encountered in the Grand Challenges of
Computing, with particular reference to the UK's "GC6: Dependable
Systems Evolution", its international cousin the "Verified Software
Initiative", and their plan to develop a Verified Software Repository.

To this end the Symposium welcomes contributions on the above themes as
well as others which can be related to them. Such additional themes
include, but are not limited to, relational semantics, relational
algebra, healthiness conditions, normal forms, linkage of theories,
algebraic descriptions, incorporation of probabilistic programming,
timed calculi and object-based descriptions, as well as alternative
programming paradigms such as functional, logical, data-flow, and
beyond. In all cases, the UTP approach should be compared and
advantages/disadvantages discussed.

The proceedings  will be published in Springer LNCS.

Papers may be up to 20 pages (single-column) in length and should
ideally be prepared using LaTeX in LNCS format and submitted as
pdf files no later than 6am British Summer Time on May 8th, 2008.
Paper submission and reviewing will be handled by Easychair
    ( http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=UTP-08 )
This site is now open for submissions.

After the symposium, it is anticipated that selected papers will
invited for submission to a journal special issue.
