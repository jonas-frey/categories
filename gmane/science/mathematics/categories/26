                               FMCS 2009
       17th Workshop on Foundational Methods in Computer Science
                 University of British Columbia, VANCOUVER, Canada
                         MAY 28th - 31st, 2009

                           FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

                                 * * *

The Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia
in cooperation with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences
is hosting the Foundational Methods in Computer Science workshop
on May 28th - 31st, 2009, on the University of British Columbia
Campus in Vancouver, Canada

The workshop is an annual informal meeting intended to bring together
researchers in mathematics and computer science. There is a focus on
the application of category theory in computer science. However, all
those who are interested in category theory or computer science are
welcome to attend.

There will be a welcoming reception on the evening of Thursday May 28. The
scientific program starts on May 29, and consists of a day of tutorials
aimed at students and newcomers to category theory, as well as a day and
a half of research talks. The meeting ends at mid-day on May 31.

Research talks

There will be some invited presentations, but the majority of the
talks are solicited from the participants. If you wish to give a talk
please send a title and abstract to johnm@math.ubc.ca. Time
slots are limited, so please respond early if you would like to be
considered for a talk.

Graduate student participation is particularly encouraged at FMCS.

Accommodations

A block of rooms has been reserved for participants at Gage Towers on the
UBC campus.

Registration

If you would like to come to the meeting or will come to the meeting
please send a brief email to johnm@math.ubc.ca with the words "would like
to attend" or "may attend" or "will attend". This is just so the local
organizer and organizing committee wiil have a first estimate of how many
people may show up.

The Second Announcement will be out soon with links to the conference
webpage, registration and accommodation.
