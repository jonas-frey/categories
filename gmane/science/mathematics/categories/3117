With respect to the gruppenpest (and perhaps the actual situation
concerning groupoids and categories), here is a quote from John
Slater, who was the head of the MIT Physics departement and a leading
American physicist:


"It was at this point that Wigner, Hund, Heitler, and Weyl entered the
picture with their "Gruppenpest": the pest of the group theory.... The
authors of the "Gruppenpest" wrote papers which were incomprehensible
to those like me who had not studied group theory, in which they
applied these theoretical results to the study of the many electron
problem. The practical consequences appreared to be negligible, but
everyone felt that to be in the mainstream one had to learn about it.
Yet there were no good texts from which one could learn group theory.
It was a frustrating experience, worthy of the name of a pest.

I had what I can only describe as a feeling of outrage at the turn
which the subject had taken...

As soon as this (Slater's) paper became known, it was obvious that a
great many other physicists were as disgusted as I had been with the
group-theoretical approach to the problem. As I heard later, there
were remarks made such as "Slater has slain the '"Gruppenpest"'. I
believe that no other piece of work I have done was so universally
popular".

I take this quote from Sternberg's book "Group Theory and Physics" who has
taken it from Slater's autobiography.

Maybe it has something to do with MIT ; -).

Best,

Jean-Pierre Marquis
