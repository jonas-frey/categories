Dear David=2C

Whatever is published in categories is
of public domain so anyone can intervene. You have nothing to apologize for=
.

I am not acquainted with recent work of
Dorette Pronk=2C but I read her 1995 Utrecht thesis in detail since I was a=
sked
to do so by her advisor. In it=2C she refers to my paper (Marta Bunge=2C "A=
n
application of descent to a classification theorem for toposes" =2C Math.
Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 107 (1990) 59-79)=2C where I prove=2C in Corollary 5=
.4 to
the main Theorem 5.1=2C the following=2C which is=2C oin the case of groupo=
ids=2C what
you call the third way. It says that=2C if W is the class of isomorphisms c=
lasses
of weak equivalences of etale complete groupoids (ECG)=2C then W admits a
calculus of right fractions=2C and the functor B from Gpd to Top induces an
equivalence ECG[W-1] \iso [Top]=2C where [Top} denotes the category of
Grotehndieck toposes (over a base S not necessarily Sets) and isomorphism
classes of geometric morphisms. So=2C the purpose of the third way=2C in my=
  view=2C
is to prove classification theorems. However=2C I am not au courant of more
recent developments.

As for the other two approaches I
mentioned in my correspondence with Andre Joyal=2C their equivalence is not=
  that
obvious. In the 1-dimensional case=2C this is done in Bunge-Pare (1979)
Proposition 2.7=2C and in the 2-dimensional case it is done in Bunge-Hermid=
a
(2010) Theorem 4-9.

Concerning size matters=2C let me observe
that my construction of the stack completion (Bunge=2C Cahiers 1979) is
meaningful regardless of size questions=2C that is=2C for any base topos S.=
  The
outcome=2C however=2C of applying it to an internal category need no longer=
  be
internal. For this reason I introduce an "axiom of stack completions"
which guarantees that stack completions of internal categories be again
internal=2Cand which is satisfied by any S a Grothehdieck topos. The questi=
on of
stating such an axiom as an additional axiom to the ones for elementary top=
oses
was proposed as a problem by Lawvere in his Montreal lectures in 1974.=A0

Good luck with your projects.
