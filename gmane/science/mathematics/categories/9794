*QAPL 2019: 16th Workshop on Quantitative Aspects of Programming Languages
and Systems*
*Prague, Czechia, April 6-7, 2019*

Conference website:
https://conf.researchr.org/track/etaps-2019/qapl-2019-papers
Submission link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qapl2019

Quantitative aspects of computation refer to the use of physical quantities
(time, bandwidth, etc.) as well as mathematical quantities (for example,
probabilities) for the characterisation of the behaviour and for
determining the properties of systems. Such quantities play a central role
in defining both the model of systems (architecture, language design,
semantics) and the methodologies and tools for the analysis and
verification of system properties. The aim of the QAPL workshop series is
to discuss the explicit use of time and probability and general quantities
either directly in the model or as a tool for the analysis or synthesis of
systems. The 16th edition of QAPL will also focus on discussing the
developments, challenges and results in this area covered by our workshop
in its nearly 20-year history.

CALL FOR PAPERS:

The aim of the QAPL workshop series is to discuss the explicit use of time,
probability and general quantities either directly in the model or as a
tool for the analysis of systems.

The following main themes are relevant to the QAPL workshop:

the design of probabilistic, real-time, quantum languages and the
definition of semantical models for such languages;

the discussion of methodologies for the analysis of probabilistic and
timing properties (e.g. security, safety, schedulability);

the probabilistic analysis of systems which do not explicitly incorporate
quantitative aspects (e.g. performance analysis);

applications to safety-critical systems, communication protocols,
asynchronous hardware, etc.

The topics of the workshop are transversal to all areas of Computer Science
including Systems, Languages, Semantics, Analysis, Information Security
etc., and consists in the probabilistic, timing and generally quantitative
aspects of the various areas. Particular relevance will be given to the
emerging areas of Quantum Computation, Bioinformatics and System Biology.

SUBMISSIONS:

In order to encourage participation and discussion, this workshop solicits
two types of submissions - extended abstracts and presentations:

1. Extended Abstracts: Submissions must be original work, and must not have
been previously published, nor be under consideration for publication
elsewhere. Regular paper submission must not exceed 6 pages (excluding the
bibliography), additional technical material, proofs etc. can be provided
in a clearly marked appendix which will  be read by reviewers at their
discretion. Regular papers will be reviewed by the PC.

2. Presentation Reports concern recent or ongoing work on relevan topics
and ideas, for timely discussion and feedback at the workshop. There is no
restriction as for previous/future publication of the contents of a
presentation. Typically, a presentation is based on a paper which recently
appeared (or which is going to appear) in the proceedings of another
recognised conference, or which has not yet been submitted. The (extended)
abstract of presentation submissions should not exceed 3 pages.
Presentation reports will be selected by the PC Chairs (based on the
availability of presentation time).

All submissions must be in PDF format and use the EPTCS LaTeX style.
Submissions can be made through Easychair.

The workshop PC will review all regular paper submissions based on their
relevance, merit, originality, and technical content. Presentation reports
will receive a lightweight review to establish their relevance for the
workshop. The authors of accepted submissions of both types are expected to
present and discuss their work at the workshop. Accepted regular papers
(allowing for minor corrections) will be published electronically in the
pre-proceedings available during the workshop and (extended versions of up
to 12-15 pages) after the workshop and a second review round  in the
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) as
post-proceedings. We also plan a special issue of a journal.

IMPORTANT DATES:

For extended abstracts:

  Submission: 10 February 2019 (AoE)
  Notification: 27 February 2019
  Final extended versions (EPTCS proceedings): 7 May 2019

For presentation reports:

  Submission: 25 February 2019 (AoE)
  Notification: 28 February 2019
