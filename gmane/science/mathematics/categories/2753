                  Call for Participation


                        DOMAINS VII

             Darmstadt, August 29 - September 2, 2004



The WORKSHOP DOMAINS series is aimed at computer scientists and
mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
foundations of computation. It focuses on domains, their applications
and related topics.

The series was conceived and first realised by Klaus Keimel in
Darmstadt in 1994. This seventh workshop returns to Darmstadt on
the occasion of his 65th birthday.


LOCATION

The Workshop will take place at Technische Universitaet Darmstadt
located in the centre of the city of Darmstadt:

       Hochschulstrasse 1 (Altes Hauptgebaeude)
       Room S1 03/123

See:   www.tu-darmstadt.de/lageplaene/
       follow the links ``Stadtmitte'', ``Abschnitt S1'', in particular
       www.tu-darmstadt.de/lageplaene/darmstadt/stadtmitte/s1.tud




WORKSHOP SCHEDULE

August 29 is the arrival day and September 2 departure day.
There will be a barbecue at 6 pm on Sunday 29. Thus, plan to arrive in
good time.

The talks will take place from 9am on Monday, August 30, until 5pm on
Wednesday, September 1.



PARTICIPATION

If you would like to participate in the workshop, please
send a message to

         domains7@mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de

It may still be possible to accommodate a few more talks. Please send
us title and abstract if you would like to speak.


ACCOMODATION

Participants will have to arrange accommodation by
themselves. For hotel reservations go to

  www.proregio-darmstadt.de/tagungen/tagungen.asp\\
  phone ++49 6151 132782
  fax   ++49 6151 132783

There you will find a link for our Workshop Domains 7; on the workshop
page follow the link for reservation (=``Buchung''). A certain
number of rooms in several hotels are available for participants of the
Workshop. They are guaranteed until July 15. But reservation will still
be possible later (don't be disturbed by the misleading text at the
bottom of the booking). If you go to

  www.proregio-darmstadt.de/uebernachten/hotel.asp

you will find a list of hotels. Closest to the University you have
  Bockshaut, Ernst Ludwig, Zentral Hotel, Alpha-City-Hotel, Best
  Western Parkhaus Hotel, Pallas Hotel, Zum Rosengarten, Ibis, Etap
  (ordered roughly with respect to closeness to the University.)
You can in any case contact the hotels directly, if you prefer.

If you have problems with arranging accomodation, please contact

             domains7@mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de


FEES

 The Workshop is organized without institutional financial
support. There will be a registration fee of 50 Euros to covering
expenses to be paid in cash at registration. (Students need not pay
this fee.)
