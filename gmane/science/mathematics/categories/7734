Dear Category theorists,

in Categories for the Working Mathematician, page 164, MacLane relates an a=
rgument, "due to Isbell", why one cannot identify all isomorphic objects. I=
  have not, however, been able to find any publication of Isbell that contai=
ns the argument. Does anyone here know if he published it?

I also have a question about the argument itself: why is it made the way Ma=
cLane does it, rather than just though noticing that all functions from cou=
ntable sets are countable, and thus themselves countable, and so isomorphic=
  to any other countable set? It seems like it would follow directly from th=
is that any functions on the natural numbers have to be equal, if isomorphi=
c (i.e. equinumerious) sets are identical. Why is MacLane doing all the "de=
tours" though products, epics, etc.?

Thanks in advance,
Staffan=
