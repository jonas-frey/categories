Dear all,

this question is motivated somewhat by the recent hullabaloo about
publishing, but take it as advice to a younger researcher about
publishing venues. I have no local category theorists to ask, so I put
it to the wider community. I hope others also find this useful.

As we all know, TAC is the most awesome journal for category theory.
But, with bean counters and their ilk hovering, sometimes it is worth
putting a paper in a journal of 'more general interest' and of 'higher
reputation'. I have one paper in JHRS (dealing with crossed modules,
their generalisations, and universal bundles) and one submitted to
TAC. But what if I have something I feel warrants a wider audience,
say algebraic geometers as well as algebraic topologists/category
theorists? (just for an example)

So, can people provide me with more examples of journals that will
accept category theory-heavy papers, and preferably with a vague idea
as to the 'prestigiousness'. I know Advances in Mathematics takes (or
has taken) category theory papers, but are there alternatives of about
this level (or above, in case there are others out there with awesome
papers searching for a venue to publish)?

On MathOverflow this sort of question might be closed as being
'subjective and argumentative' (this being the closest of the preset
options), but I hope the moderators will allow a healthy exchange of
views.

Best regards,

David Roberts
