Dear Steve,

For any monad T and any category C, the forgetful functor U^T:C^T->C=20
from the category of algebras creates limits, both weighted and conical
(i.e. unweighted). In particular you could take C=3DSet.

This remains true if T is a V-enriched monad and C a V-enriched =
category,
In particular you could take C=3DV=3DCat.

The special thing about the case of Cat is that you might want to =
replace=20
the 2-category of algebras C^T by a variant involving morphisms which=20
do not preserve algebra structure strictly, but only in some weaker =
sense.
In this case, the forgetful functor will create only some limits; =
exactly which
ones depend on exactly how you vary C^T.=20

For the case where morphisms preserve algebra structure up to =
isomorphism, see
the papers,

Blackwell-Kelly-Power, 2-dimensional monad theory
Power-Robinson, PIE-limits

For the case where morphisms preserve algebra only up to a coherent =
comparison
map, not necessarily invertible, see=20

Lack, Limits for lax morphisms
Lack-Shulman, Enhanced 2-categories and limits for lax morphisms.

The latter paper, which was also the basis for my CT2008 talk at Calais, =
proposes
moving beyond the framework of 2-categories, to "enhanced 2-categories", =
in which
you keep track both of the strict and the non-strict morphisms. This =
allows a much=20
finer treatment of which limits lift in the lax case. (The theory there =
includes the=20
pseudo case of preservation up to isomorphism, but the difference is =
much less
stark there.)=20

Best wishes,

Steve Lack.
