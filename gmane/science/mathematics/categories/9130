Leopold Schlicht's question is rightful, and, of course, not new. I
guess there will be at least a few replies to some specifics in
Schlicht's mail, but in this response I will not provide a reply, but
rather, if I may, take the opportunity to add one further remark to my
"Turing Category" note some month ago.

I didn't say anything more deeply about recursion, and neither will I do
now. However, recursion is tricky, as we see in debates about the
Church-Turing thesis. Some "functions" defined e.g. in Turing's proof of
his thesis are dubious since they rely on (and hide the use of) powers.
In an untyped world it's easier to get away doing so, but if we type
things, we cannot avoid the powertype, and then we are required to move
into type constructors, where CS's CT is not very clean. It may support
"practice of typing" (such as in ML/Haskell and differently as in HoTT),
but it lacks proper foundations.

Leinster's paper scratches the surface only, and does not go more deeply
e.g. into quantifiers (as adjoints, as CT would explain them). The
Subset (or Separation, or Comprehension) Axiom, which enforces and
allows the mix of set theory sentences with underlying first-order
sentences, is in Leinster's
paper mentioned just as "is determined by its effect", but not further
developed in CT. Recursion needs this axiom, and recursion in ZFC must
be connected with recursions as appearing in the
Church-Kleene-Post-Turing thesis as well. It isn't, as far (or near) as
I can see, at least not all that well, and it is very unclear to me if
making foundations totally Lawvere will help at all in that respect.

To me, CT is a bridge (between many things, but also) between "the
practice of mathematicians" and the practice of computing and computer
scientists.

If you ask me, as many implicitly point out about those "Paradoxes", we
have allowed impredicativity to slip away, and become a de facto
standard tool for constructing mathematically nice and acceptable
things. The liberal use of equality fuels that impredicativity drive,
that every once in a while makes you find the ball out of bounds.

Best,

Patrik
