Data and conditions constitute a presentation.  The graph, diagrams, cones
& cocones of a sketch are a presentation.  This idea has not been
superseded, not at all, but it has been completed (in two senses) by the
concept of theory, which is the  object generated by the presentation: The
theory of a sketch, the classifiying topos, the algebraic theory in the
sense of Lawvere, and so on.  This object contains all the information
about any model.

That idea is in some way the other face of, or the complementary point of
view about, data and conditions.
