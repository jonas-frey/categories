Dear Michael,

What Vaughan called the "clean-shaven gods" argument is, I think, the
normal logicians' excuse for barring empty carriers.

The logical deduction

   (all) x. P(x)
   -------------
   P(a)
   -------------
   (exists) x. P(x)

is false for empty carriers, but many logicians persuade themselves that
the deduction is correct and the empty carriers are therefore monsters.

Vaughan I think is taking P(x) as "x is clean-shaven" in the theory of gods.

You can get a similar phenomenon with equational reasoning, especially
for many-sorted algebras. I expect this is what bothered Meinke and
Tucker when they wrote their monograph on universal algebra.

The fix was discovered by Mostowski (I believe). To use a free variable
such as a is to hypothesize a denotation for it in the carrier.
Therefore in each deduction one should be explicit about the context of
free variables that may be used. This deals cleanly with empty carriers.

All the best,

Steve.
