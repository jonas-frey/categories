Yesterday, 21 October 2017, our dear friend and colleague Kosta Dosen=20
passed away; losing his long struggle with cancer. He is survived by his =

daughter Ana. The service and funeral will take place at the New=20
Cemetery in Belgrade on 24 October 2017, 12:00 (noon).


Born 1954 in Belgrade (Serbia), Kosta Dosen graduated from the=20
University of Belgrade in 1977 and received a doctorate from the=20
University of Oxford in 1981. He became a professor at the Mathematical=20
Institute Belgrade in 1982, was professor at the Department of Computer=20
Science of the University of Toulouse (France) from 1994 to 1998, and=20
held the Chair of Logic in the Philosophical Faculty of the University=20
of Belgrade since 2003. He had visiting posts at universities including=20
Notre Dame (USA), Montpellier (France) and Tuebingen (Germany).


Kosta Dosen's D.Phil. on "Logical Constants" was supervised by Michael=20
Dummett and Dana Scott. As part of this, and in subsequent publications, =

he developed a proof-theoretic characterization of logical constants by=20
means of so-called "double-line rules", which has become widely=20
discussed since and is one of the major approaches in the debate on what =

logicality should mean. Working on the proof theory (and partly also=20
model theory) of logics with restricted structural rules, he coined the=20
term "substructural logic" at a conference in Tuebingen in 1990.=20
However, the main topic of his intellectual life was the field of=20
categorial proof theory that was opened up by Lambek, Lawvere and=20
others. Kosta Dosen shaped the development of this field in many=20
respects, in particular by his books on "Cut Elimination in Categories"=20
and "Proof-Theoretical Coherence" (the latter together with Zoran=20
Petric). He was a strong adherent and promotor of what Prawitz called=20
"general proof theory", which is the study of proofs as objects in their =

own right rather than under the aspect of provability. This implied for=20
him that the question of the identity of proofs was the central topic of =

general proof theory, where he was particularly interested in the=20
relationship between normalization-based and generality-based=20
approaches. In recent years he worked with great passion on Goedel's=20
work including unpublished manuscripts in his Nachlass. A critical=20
edition (together with Milos Adzic) of Goedel's Notre Dame course in=20
logic has just appeared.

Kosta Dosen was a gifted and dedicated teacher, who  was an inspiration=20
to students and colleagues alike. His explanations will live on in the=20
pages of his textbook on elementary logic (in Serbian).


A further, and more thorough discussion of Kosta Dosen's achievements=20
will be published at a later stage.


Kosta will be greatly missed by relatives, friends and colleagues, and=20
all who had the good fortune to know him.
