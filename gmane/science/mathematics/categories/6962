Dear Categories:

Sad to think Albrecht Dold has passed away.  I met him when I
was a graduate student in Princeton from Fall 1955 to Spring 1958.
I remember a gentle and kind person with a twinkle in the eye and
a wry, lively sense of humor.  Everyone liked him, and he was much
in Fine Hall around Steenrod.  There were many visitors in that
period: Hirzebruch, Serre, Kan, Ioan James, to name a few, and Artin,
Moore, Milnor, Spenser/Kodaira were very active.  It was a great
time to visit Princeton, and his career really took off from that
period.

Here is some information I found about him on the internet:

Born: August 5, 1928, Triberg, Germany
Died: September 26, 2011, Neckargem=FCnd, Germany

Education:

1948 - 1954 Studies of Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy, University of =
Heidelberg
1954 Ph.D., University of Heidelberg
 	"=DCber fasernweise Homotopie=E4quivalenz von Faserr=E4umen" =
under Herbert Seifert
1958 Habilitation, University of Heidelberg
 	(Title not found.)

Positions:

1954 - 1956 Assistant, Institute of Mathematics, University of =
Heidelberg
1956 - 1958 Assistant, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ
1958 - 1960 Lecturer, Institute of Mathematics, University of Heidelberg
1960 - 1962 Professor, Columbia University, New York
1962 - 1963 Full Professor, University of Z=FCrich
1963 - 1996 Full Professor, University of Heidelberg
1984 - 1985 Pr=E4sident der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung
1991 - 1994 Sekret=E4r der Mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlichen Klasse =

1995 - 1998 Vice-President, International Mathematical Union=20

Career:=20

Albrecht Dold was born on August 5, 1928 in Triberg (Black Forest),=20
Germany. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of=20
Heidelberg, then worked for some years at the Institute for Advanced=20
Study in Princeton, at Columbia University, New York and at the=20
University of Z=FCrich. In 1963 he returned to Heidelberg, where he=20
has stayed since, declining several offers to attractive positions=20
elsewhere. A. Dold's seminal work in algebraic topology has brought=20
him international recognition beyond the world of mathematics itself.=20
In particular, his work on fixed-point theory has made his a household=20=

name in economics, and his book "Lectures on Algebraic Topology" a=20
standard reference among economists as well as mathematicians.  He
had 19 students and 58 descendants.

He was a student of Herbert Seifert, who had 6 students and 205 =
descendants.
Seifert's first dissertation, "Konstruktion dreidimensionaler =
geschlossener=20
R=E4ume", was done under Threlfall in Dresden, 1930.  His second thesis,=20=

"Topologie dreidimensionaler gefaserter R=E4ume", was done under van der=20=

Waerden, Leipzig,1932.  There is an interesting Wikipedia page on him,
but the one on Dold is not filled out.  Seifert became a friend and
long-term collaborator of Threlfall, and their book is well known.=20

A co-student of Seifert's and a long-standing friend and collaborator
with Dold was Dieter Puppe, whose dissertation, "Zur Homotopie von=20
Abbildungen eines Polyeders, was also finished in 1954.  He had
17 students and 93 descendants, but he died from a brain tumor
already in 2005.

Dold is survived by his wife, Dr. Yvonne Dold-Samplonius, a =
distinguished
historian of mathematics.  She was born in Haarlem, The Netherlands, in
1937, they were married in 1965, and she submitted her thesis, "Book of=20=

Assumptions by Aqatun", in 1977 in Amsterdam.
