Dear fellow category theorists=2C



It seems that the time has come to make public the disappearance=2C on June=
  11=2C of Mamuka Jibladze in Tbilisi. His collaborators were informed yeste=
rday=2C but there was still some hope that he would reappear soon. This not=
  being yet the case=2C it my be a case tht the entire ctegory theory commun=
ity should take up joining those in Georgia who are demanding a quick inves=
tigation.

Let us hope that nothing serious has happened to him.
