Lambek's lemma holds that every initial algebra is an isomorphism (and
dually for every final coalgebra).

With how small a diagram can you prove this?  Here's an argument with
five arrows.

TA --a--> A
  |        |
  |Tf      |f
  |        |
  v        v
TTA -Ta-> TA
.           \
.            \a
.             \
.             _\|
.
.                 A

Here f is the unique T-homomorphism from the initial T-algebra A to the
T-algebra TA, while the a arrow at lower right whiskers
(1-categorically) the square witnessing that f is a T-homomorphism.
This whisker creates another commutative square, namely afa = aTaTf =
aT(af).  The latter square therefore witnesses a homomorphism af: A -->
A. But by initiality there is only one such homomorphism, the identity,
whence af = 1.  Hence fa = TaTf (commutative diagram) = T(af) = T(1) =
1, whence f and a are mutual inverses.

I showed this argument to Peter Freyd in 1998 and his first response was
an argument with seven arrows that he felt was needed to make the
argument stick.  I suggested that his argument was simply a blow-up of
mine, which he agreed to half an hour later.

Lambek's lemma is somewhat reminiscent of Proposition 5 of Book I of
Euclid's *Elements*, that if two sides of a triangle are equal then
their opposite angles are equal.  This is the celebrated *Pons Asinorum*
or Bridge of Asses.  Applied here, the ability to prove Lambek's lemma
is a litmus test of whether you can think categorically.  (Personally I
consider the uniqueness of the free algebra on a given set as an
adequate test.)

Until recently Proposition 5 was always proved along the lines in
Euclid, cf.
http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI5.html .  Then
someone's computer program noticed that the triangles ABC and ACB (A
being the apex, with |AB| = |AC|) were congruent, from which the result
followed trivially.

Such a result would register about 2 on the New York Times' Richter
scale of earthshaking mathematical results, were it not for the fact
that it was first noticed by a computer (so the story went).

The sad thing is that even if this five-arrow proof of Lambek's lemma
had been first found by a computer, the New York Times could not have
whipped up the same enthusiasm for it as for the Pons Asinorum.  CT has
not yet acquired the visibility of geometry in the mind of the
technically literate public.
