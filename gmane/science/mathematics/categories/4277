Ronnie points out the very excellent 1997
book on smooth analysis by Kriegl & Michor.
 In fact, not the reviewer but the authors themselves=20
originally stated the principle of=20

functional analysis "rather than" category theory.

It is rather strange since much of the=20
material in the book was arrived at
by very categorical means. For example,
results published in Kriegl's joint work
with Alfred Frolicher are basic. My dismay
is reflected in my RCMP paper on Volterra,
where I praise the book for its powerful=20
combination of

functional analysis "and" category theory.

In  a related expositional choice the book
claims to be about topological vector spaces,
 but the definition of morphism used betrays the fact
that the weaker structures of bounded=20
sequences and of C-infinity paths are the
actual underpinning.

It would be instructive to know whether this
strategy actually widened the audience in the=20
past 10 years.
