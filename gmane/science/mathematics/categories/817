First off, sober (or sobre) is not an eponym (the fancy name for these).
I often write boolean, hausdorff, and euclidean.  You sometimes see
Abelian.  So there are no standards.  Note that boolean, euclidean and
abelian have adjectival endings (as does Hermitian), while hausdorff does
not.  In French and German, the two other languages I know somewhat, it is
standard that all adjectives be in lower case, that is not so in English.
So it comes down to a matter of convention and, basically, familiarity.
In physics, it is considered a mark of great respect to achieve lower case
status.  Nearly all physical constants and units are lower case.  But
mathematicians do not accept standards conventions and journals make no
attempt to enforce uniformity in these matters.
