Dear Vaughan,

Every closed category can be embedded fully faithfully into a closed
monoidal category such that the closed structure is preserved; this is
due to Laplaza (exact reference in my paper). However, non-monoidal
closed categories do occur. I was motivated by the example of
A-infinity categories, and frankly, I am not aware of any other
non-trivial and non-artificial examples, but I am sure there must be
some, it is just my ignorance.

Best,
Oleksandr
