		      Call for Papers

            Seventh International Conference on
       Algebraic Methodology and Software Technology
     AMAST '98,  January 5 to 9 , 1999,  Amazonia, Brazil.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals

The major goal of the  AMAST  Conferences  is  to  put  software
development  technology  on  a  firm,  mathematical foundation.
Particular emphasis is given to algebraic and logical foundations
of software technology.  An eventual goal is to establish algebraic
and logical methodologies as viable and attractive approaches to
software engineering.

The first three editions of AMAST were held at the University of Iowa
(1989 and 1991) and at the University of Twente (1993). The fourth
conference was held at  Concordia University of Montreal (1995), the
fifth at Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich (1996), and the sixth
was held in Sidney, Australia, (December 13-17, 1997).
During these meetings, AMAST has attracted an international following
among researchers and practitioners interested in software technology,
programming methodology and their algebraic and logical foundations.
In addition, the first day of each conference has been dedicated to
Mathematics Education for Software Engineers.

Following this successful trend, the seventh AMAST International
Conference will be held in Amazonia, Brazil, from January 5 to
January 9, 1999.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Submissions

As in the previous years we invite papers reporting original research
in algebra, logic and other formalisms suitable as a foundation for
software technology, as well as software technologies developed by means
of logic and algebraic methodologies. Submissions should not have been
published and should not be under consideration for publication elsewhere.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:


SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
        systems software technology,
        application software technology,
        concurrent and reactive systems,
        formal methods in industrial software development,
        formal techniques for software requirements, design.

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY
        logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms,
        constraint programming and concurrency,
        program verification and transformation,
        programming calculi,
        specification languages and tools,
        formal specification and development case studies.

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS
        logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra,
        algebraic foundations for languages and systems,
        theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning,
        logics of programs.

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers)
        software development environments,
        support for correct software development,
        system support for reuse,
        tools for prototyping,
        validation and verification,
        computer algebra systems,
        theorem proving systems.

We invite prospective authors to submit electronically previously
unpublished papers of high quality.  Papers should be between five
and fifteen pages in LNCS style.  Ten page papers are ideal, and
papers longer than fifteen pages may be rejected without detailed
refereeing.  Please send a fully self-contained postscript file
(preferably derived from LaTeX with the LNCS style) to
amast98@lmf-di.puc-rio.br as well as to mfrias@inf.puc-rio.br.
If for any reason it is impossible to submit a paper electronically,
authors should send six paper copies of their submission to the
programme chair at the address below.

All papers will be refereed by the programme committee, and will be
judged based on their significance, technical merit, and relevance
to the conference. As in the past, we expect the proceedings to
be published by Springer-Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Computer
Science Series.  Papers should be received by June 15, 1998.
