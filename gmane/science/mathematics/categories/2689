      -- Pieter Hofstra: Realizability
      -- Phil Scott: Geometry of Interaction
      -- Ernie Manes: Guarded Semigroups

and has two days of contributed research talks.

If you wish to participate please let us know before 21st May 2004.
If, in addition, you wish to give a presentation you must provide an abstract and
