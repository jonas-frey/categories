FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

First International Conference on Formal Structures for
Computation and Deduction (FSCD'16)

22 June -- 26 June 2016, Porto, Portugal
http://fscd2016.dcc.fc.up.pt/

*** ABSTRACT SUBMISSION DUE 29 JANUARY 2016 ***
**** PAPER SUBMISSION DUE  5 FEBRUARY 2016 ****

==========================================================================
IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract Submission: 29 January 2016
Paper Submission   :  5 February 2016
Rebuttal           : 21 - 23 March 2016
Notification       :  6 April 2016
==========================================================================


FSCD  (http://fscdconference.org/)   covers  all  aspects   of  formal
structures for computation  and deduction from theoretical foundations
to  applications.    Building  on  two   communities,  RTA  (Rewriting
Techniques  and  Applications)  and  TLCA (Typed  Lambda  Calculi  and
Applications),  FSCD embraces  their  core topics  and broadens  their
scope  to  closely related  areas  in  logics,  proof theory  and  new
emerging models of computation  such as quantum computing and homotopy
type theory.  The name of the new conference comes from an unpublished
but  important  book by  Gerard  Huet  that  strongly influenced  many
researchers in the area.

Suggested, but not exclusive, list of topics for submission are:

1 Calculi
   * Lambda calculus
   * Logics (first-order, higher-order, equational, modal, linear,
     classical, constructive, etc.)
   * Rewriting systems (string, term, higher-order, graph, conditional,
     modulo, infinitary, etc.)
   * Proof theory (natural deduction, sequent calculus, proof nets, etc.)
   * Type theory and logical frameworks
   * Homotopy type theory

2. Methods in Computation and Deduction
   * Type systems (polymorphism, dependent, recursive, intersection,
     session, etc.)
   * Induction, coinduction
   * Matching, unification, completion, orderings
   * Strategies (normalization, completeness, etc.)
   * Tree automata
   * Model building and model checking
   * Proof search (resolution, paramodulation, narrowing, focusing, etc.)
   * Constraint solving and decision procedures

3. Semantics
   * Operational semantics and abstract machines
   * Game Semantics and applications
   * Domain theory and categorical models
   * Quantitative models (timing, probabilities, resources, etc.)
   * Quantum computation and emerging models in computation

4. Algorithmic Analysis and Transformations of Formal Systems
   * Type Inference and type checking
   * Abstract Interpretation
   * Complexity analysis and implicit computational complexity
   * Checking termination, confluence, derivational complexity and
     related properties
   * Symbolic computation

5. Tools and Applications
   * Programming and proof environments (proof assistants, automated
     theorem prover, proof checkers, specialized provers, dependently
     typed languages, etc.)
   * Verification tools (abstract interpretation, termination,
     confluence, specialized provers, etc.)
   * Libraries for proof assistants and interactive theorem provers
     (support for variable bindings, nominal, polynomial, equality, etc.)
   * Case studies in proof assistants and interactive theorem provers
     (formalizations, mechanizations, certifications)
   * Certifications (theorems, rewriting techniques, etc.)
   * Applications of formal systems inside and outside of CS (biology,
     linguistics, physics, education, etc.)

PUBLICATION
The proceedings will be published as an electronic volume in the
Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs). All LIPIcs
proceedings are open access.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
Submissions can be made in two categories: regular research papers and
system descriptions.

Submissions of research papers must present original research which is
unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 15 pages
(including figures and bibliography). Submissions of research papers
will be judged on originality, significance, correctness, and readability.

Submission of system descriptions must describe a working system which
has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 10
pages and should contain a link to a working system. System
descriptions will be judged on originality, significance, usefulness,
and readability.

Proofs of theoretical results that do not fit within the page limit,
executables of systems, code of case studies, benchmarks used to
evaluate a given system, should be made available, via a reference to
a website or in an appendix of the paper. Reviewers will be encouraged
to consider this additional material, but are not obliged
to. Submissions must be self-contained within the respective page
limit; considering the additional material should not be necessary to
assess the merits of a submission.

Submissions must be formatted using the LIPIcs style files using the
instructions at

http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/

A condition of submission is that, if accepted, one of the authors
must attend the conference to give the  presentation.

Papers should be submitted via easychair. The submission site is at

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fscd16

CONFERENCE AWARDS

Two awards will be selected: one for the best paper and another one for
the best student paper.

SPECIAL ISSUE

After the conference, authors of selected papers will be invited to submit
extended versions of their work to a special issue published in the
open-access
journal Logical Methods in Computer Science (LMCS).

SATELLITE EVENTS

The  following meetings and  workshops are  colocated with  FSCD 2016:
CL&C, DCM, HDRA, HOR, IFIP  Working Group 1.6, ITRS, Linearity, LFMTP,
