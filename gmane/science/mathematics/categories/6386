Dear Colleagues,

It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Leo Esakia on
November 17, 2010. This is a big loss for all of Leo's friends,
colleagues, and students, but also for the logic community as a whole.

Leo was the founder and the anchor of the logic school in Georgia. He
was a constant source of wisdom, inspiration, and encouragement to all
of his colleagues and students. Leo made numerous important
contributions to the study of algebraic and topological semantics of
intuitionistic and modal logics. Several landmark theorems in the
field bear his name. He also contributed immensely to establishing a
strong research community working on algebraic, topological, and
categorical methods in logic.

Leo Esakia was not only a brilliant mathematician, but also an
extraordinary human being. He will stay in our memory as a wonderful,
charming, refined, and attentive =C2=A0person who was always there to give
his support, encouragement, and guidance. He will be sorely missed. We
believe his scientific legacy will be long remembered, and his ideas
will carry forward.

Our thoughts are with Leo's family at these difficult times.
