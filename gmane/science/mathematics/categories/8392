I met Grothendieck only once, in the summer of 1971.  There was a NATO-spon=
sored logic conference in, I think, England and some people decided to spon=
sor a counter conference that would have no connection with anything milita=
ry.  It was held in a private boarding school in a town called Uldum, Denma=
rk which is something like 50 km south of Aarhus.  G. had given up mathemat=
ics at that time and agreed to come presumably because it was anti-military=
. I was spending half of that summer in Aarhus and I had a car, so on the d=
ay G. was scheduled to speak, I got in my car and drove down.  His talk was=
  interesting.  As I recall, he stated the Giraud axioms for a topos and the=
n said that to him, they looked an awful lot like set theory and logicians =
should study them from that point of view.  Maybe he said intuitionistic se=
t theory; I don't recall.  Well the Giraud axioms didn't--and don't--look m=
uch like set theory to me.  So at the end of his talk I asked him if he was=
  familiar with the Lawvere-Tierney axioms for a topos, which looked a lot m=
ore like set theory than the Giraud axioms.  He said that he didn't know wh=
at they were and asked me to come to the board and explain them.  Which I d=
id (I added complete and cocomplete to recover the original definition that=
  G. had used).  He agreed that looked a lot more like set theory.  A few lo=
gicians did study toposes, but whether they were motivated by G.'s lecture,=
  I can't tell you.  After that we had an hour-long discussion of Survivre, =
which didn't convince me.

Bill can correct me if I am wrong, but I recall that at the Nice meeting a =
year earlier, Bill had tried to tell him about elementary toposes, but G. w=
asn't interested in anything mathematical.
