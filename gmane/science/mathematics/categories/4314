Wrote, with much else, about an equivalent to the axiom scheme of
replacement in ETCS, and his mimeographed notes on it now reprinted at TAC

It is right at the end, on p. 34 of the reprint.  To me, it is really a
very nice stream-lined version of a reflection principle and deserves
more of a look.  Up to now I have tended to translate it into a
replacement scheme because they are more familiar to my audience.  But
it is much more elegant as it cuts straight down to  a very elegant
isomorphism-invariant principle.
