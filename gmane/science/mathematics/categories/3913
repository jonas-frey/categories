A lot of people long before Tarski, or Hilbert, knew how to extend this
kind of axiomatization to any finite dimension.  But is
it "satisfactory"?

Specifically, what about (n-dimensional) volumes.  Euclid 11--13 does
not well axiomatize the method of exhaustion he uses for the volume of
solids.  And Dehn's theorem that already for polyhedra the theory of
volume will not reduce to equidecomposition.

I should probably already know this, but what is known about the theory
of n-dimensional volume in axiomatic n-dimensional Euclidean geometry?
