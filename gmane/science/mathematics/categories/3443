           Preliminary Call for Papers

         Eight International Conference on

  Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications  (TLCA '07)

                Paris, June 26-28, 2007

    Part of RDP 07  (http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/rdp07/)

The TLCA series of conferences serves as a forum for presenting
original research results that are broadly relevant to the theory
and applications of typed calculi. The following list of topics
is non-exhaustive:


    * Proof-theory: Natural deduction and sequent calculi, cut
      elimination and normalisation, linear logic and proof nets,
      type-theoretic aspects of computational complexity
    * Semantics: Denotational semantics, game semantics,
      realisability, categorical models
    * Implementation: Abstract machines, parallel execution, optimal
      reduction, type systems for program optimisation
    * Types: Subtypes, dependent types, type inference, polymorphism,
      types in theorem proving
    * Programming: Foundational aspects of functional and
      object-oriented programming, proof search and logic programming,
      connections between and combinations of functional and logic
      programming, type checking


The programme of TLCA  will consist of three invited talks and about
25 papers selected from original contributions. Accepted papers will
be published as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science
series (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html).

Submissions: The submitted papers should describe original work and
should allow the Programme Committee to assess the merits of the
contribution: in particular references and comparisons with related
work should be included.
Submission of material already published or submitted to other
conferences with published proceedings is not allowed.
Papers should not exceed 15 pages in Springer LNCS format
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html).
Instructions for submissions will appear soon.
