GENERAL INFORMATION:=0A=
=0A=
Since 1994, the RAMiCS conference series has been the main venue for=0A=
research on relation algebras, Kleene algebras and similar algebraic=0A=
formalisms, and their applications as conceptual and methodological=0A=
tools in computer science and beyond.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
TOPICS:=0A=
=0A=
We invite submissions in the general fields of algebras relevant to=0A=
computer science and applications of such algebras. Topics include but=0A=
are not limited to:=0A=
=0A=
* Theory=0A=
   - algebras such as semigroups, residuated lattices, semirings,=0A=
     Kleene algebras, relation algebras and quantales=0A=
   - their connections with program logics and other logics=0A=
   - their use in the theories of automata, concurrency, formal languages,=
=0A=
     games, networks and programming languages=0A=
   - the development of algebraic, algorithmic, category-theoretic,=0A=
     coalgebraic and proof-theoretic methods for these theories=0A=
   - their formalisation with theorem provers=0A=
=0A=
* Applications=0A=
   - tools and techniques for program correctness, specification and=0A=
     verification=0A=
   - quantitative and qualitative models and semantics of computing=0A=
     systems and processes=0A=
   - algorithm design, automated reasoning, network protocol analysis,=0A=
     social choice, optimisation and control=0A=
   - industrial applications=0A=
=0A=
WATA 2020=0A=
=0A=
WATA 2020, the 10th International Workshop on Weighted Automata: Theory and=
=0A=
Applications, will take place just after RAMICS, from 14 to 17 April, in=0A=
Marseille. We encourage participants to combine the two events.=0A=
=0A=
SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:=0A=
=0A=
Submission is via EasyChair at=0A=
=0A=
   https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dramics2020=0A=
=0A=
All papers will be peer-reviewed by at least three referees. The=0A=
proceedings will be published in an LNCS volume by Springer, ready at=0A=
the conference. Submissions must not be published or under review for=0A=
publication elsewhere. Submissions must be in English using a PDF not=0A=
exceeding 16 pages in LNCS style. Submissions must provide sufficient=0A=
information to judge their merits. Additional material may be provided=0A=
in a clearly marked appendix or by a reference to a manuscript on a web=0A=
site. Experimental data, software or mathematical components for theorem=0A=
provers must be available in sufficient detail for referees. Deviation=0A=
from these requirements may lead to rejection.=0A=
=0A=
One author of each accepted paper is expected to present the paper at=0A=
the conference. Accepted papers must be produced with LaTeX. Formatting=0A=
instructions and LNCS style files are available at=0A=
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html=0A=
=0A=
As for earlier RAMiCS conferences, we intend to publish a journal=0A=
special issue with revised and extended versions of a selection of the=0A=
best papers.=0A=
