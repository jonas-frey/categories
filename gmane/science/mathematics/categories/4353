Sorry to be misleading with MBP; perhaps I should have said Melzak's
"Bypass Principle", or Melzak's "Bypass" principle, rather than using the
MBP abbreviation for typing convenience, because both Google and Google
Scholar provide lots of relevant hits to searches without the quotes.
Anyway, the basic reference I have in mind is: Z. A. Melzak, "Bypasses, A
simple approach to complexity" John Wiley & Sons (1983) ISBN 0-471-86854-=
X

The connection with duality is very appealing, thank you, because
dualities certainly offer some very profound insights. However, I have no
intuition as to why an adjunction suggested by a (Melzak's) Bypass should
have unit and counit as isomorphisms? Should there be a "dualizing object=
"
lurking about? Are there any known dualities for presheaf categories=20
Set^(C^op) where C is something simple like (1 --> 1) or (2 <-- 1 --> 2)
or (1 --> 2 --> 3 <-- 1) etc. (identities omitted). What I'm looking for
is a bypass for gluing presheaves.

Thank you for your kind comments. ...... Al
