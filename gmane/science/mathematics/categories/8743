In this paper
M. Grandis, Finite sets and symmetric simplicial sets, Theory Appl.
Categ. 8 (2001), No. 8, 244-252
the following results are proved, and point (a') should be related to
what you want:

The category of finite cardinals, equivalent to the category of
finite sets and the site of augmented symmetric simplicial sets, is:
(a') the free strict monoidal category with an assigned symmetric
monoid;
(b') the subcategory of Set generated by finite cardinals, their
faces, degeneracies and main transpositions;
(c') the category generated by faces, degeneracies and main
transpositions, under the symmetric cosimplicial relations.

The properties above are related to well-known (see Mac Lane)
characterisations of the category of finite ordinals, the site of
augmented simplicial sets:
(a) the free strict monoidal category with an assigned internal monoid;
(b) the subcategory of Set generated by finite ordinals, their faces
and degeneracies;
(c) the category generated by faces and degeneracies, under the
cosimplicial relations.
