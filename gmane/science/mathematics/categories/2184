		 2 Research Fellow/Postdoc positions
		      in Logic and Computation,
			 University of Ottawa

The Logic Group in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the
University of Ottawa is looking to hire two research fellows/postdocs
beginning in September, 2003.

The first position is part of a project on "Programming Languages for
Quantum Computing" led by P. Selinger. The ideal applicant will have a
background in programming language semantics, and an interest in
developing and applying semantic methods in a quantum computation
setting. Some experience in mathematical physics or related
mathematics is an asset.

The second position is in any area of category theory, categorical
logic, and theoretical computer science.

Both research fellows / postdocs will participate in the activities of
the Logic and Foundations of Computation Group. This group includes
faculty and students from several different Ottawa-area
universities. In the Math Department, the Logic Group currently
includes 3 faculty members (R. Blute, P. Scott, P. Selinger), 1
postdoc, and 6 graduate students. For more information about our team,
see http://www.mathstat.uottawa.ca/lfc/

The research fellowships/postdocs are initially for one year, with a
possible renewal for a second year.  The annual salary is $40,000.
Duties include research and the teaching of two one-semester
courses. Potential applicants should contact one of us:

 Philip Scott  (phil@site.uottawa.ca)
 Richard Blute  (rblute@mathstat.uottawa.ca)
 Peter Selinger  (selinger@mathstat.uottawa.ca)

immediately by email to indicate their interest. They should then also
send a curriculum vitae, a research plan, and arrange for three
confidential letters of recommendation, with one addressing teaching,
to be sent to Professor Mayer Alvo, Chairman, Department of
Mathematics and Statistics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON Canada,
K1N 6N5. Applicants are also encouraged to include up to three copies
of their most significant publications.

The official application deadline has already passed, but we are still
considering applications, and interested persons should contact us as
soon as possible. Those who have already applied for a position will
of course be considered and do not have to re-send an application.


P. Scott, R. Blute, and P. Selinger
