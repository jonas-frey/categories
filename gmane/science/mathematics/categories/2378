CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT
10th International Conference on
Algebraic Methodology And Software Technology
AMAST 2004
http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/events/amast2004/

---------------------------------------------
July 12th - 16th, 2004
Stirling, Scotland, UK.

The major goal of the AMAST Conferences is to promote research that may
lead to the setting of software technology on a firm, mathematical basis.
This goal is achieved by a large international cooperation with
contributions from both academia and industry. The virtues of a software
technology developed on a mathematical basis have been envisioned as being
capable of providing software that is (a) correct, and the correctness can
be proved mathematically, (b) safe, so that it can be used in the
implementation of critical systems, (c) portable, i.e., independent of
computing platforms and language generations, and (d) evolutionary, i.e.,
it is self-adaptable and evolves with the problem domain. All previous
editions of the AMAST Conference, which were held at Iowa City (1989,1991),
Twente (1993), Montreal (1995), Munich (1996), Sydney (1997), Manaus
(1999), Iowa City (2000), and Reunion Island (2002), made contributions to
the AMAST goals by reporting and disseminating academic and industrial
achievements within the AMAST area of interest. During these meetings,
AMAST attracted an international following among researchers and
practitioners interested in software technology, programming methodology
and their algebraic and logical foundations. In addition, starting with the
1993 edition, the first day of each conference was dedicated to Mathematics
Education for Software Engineers.


TOPICS
------
As in previous years, we will invite papers reporting original research on
setting software technology on a firm mathematical basis. We expect two
kinds of submissions for this conference: technical papers and system
demonstrations. Of particular interest is research on using algebraic,
logic, and other formalisms suitable as foundations for software
technology, as well as software technologies developed by means of logic
and algebraic methodologies. Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to, the following:

SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY:

    * systems software technology
    * application software technology
    * concurrent and reactive systems
    * formal methods in industrial software development
    * formal techniques for software requirements, design
    * evolutionary software/adaptive systems

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY:

    * logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms
    * constraint programming and concurrency
    * program verification and transformation
    * programming calculi
    * specification languages and tools
    * formal specification and development case studies

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS:

    * logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra
    * algebraic foundations for languages and systems, coinduction
    * theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning
    * logics of programs

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers):

    * software development environments
    * support for correct software development
    * system support for reuse
    * tools for prototyping
    * component based software development tools
    * validation and verification
    * computer algebra systems
    * theorem proving systems


IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
AMAST'2004 Conference: July 12-16, 2004
Final details have to be confirmed for paper submissions, but will most
likely be end December 2003/early January 2004.


PUBLICATION
-----------
Previous AMAST conferences have been published in the LNCS series by Springer.


LOCATION
--------
The conference will be held at the University of Stirling
