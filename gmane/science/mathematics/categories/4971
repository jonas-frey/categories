I came from Algebraic Specifications to Category Theory. When my =20
students (computer science, software engineering) ask me about the =20
benefit of categories I'm referring often to the "Categorical =20
Manifesto" of Jo Goguen.

If they insist more and ask "Be honest! What is the REAL reason that =20
some theoreticians like categories so much?" Then I'm trying to be =20
honest and say: Because categories are the winner of the competition =20
"What mathematical structure is closed under the maximal number of =20
"reasonable" constructions". They have just the right amount of =20
structure - not too few, as graphs for example, and not to much, as =20
cpo's for example. And if there is time I'm telling them about the =20
"Erlanger Programm" of Felix Klein.

Of course we can turn this statement and say: If a construction =20
doesn't provide a category when the "inputs" are categories, then this =20
construction can not be considered to be a "reasonable construction".

Best regards

Uwe Wolter
