I wonder whether anyone has done an investigation (in either a journal
paper or web-accessible lecture notes) of the way in which

        the natural numbers object has to be re-defined
                in categories with weak logic.


It is well known, for example, that in a category that (has finite
products but) is not cartesian closed, parameters have to be added
explicitly to the definition, yielding a diagram of the form

                zero                 succ
        Gamma --------> N x Gamma <-------- N x Gamma
          ||                .                   .
          ||                .                   .
          ||                . rec               . <left, rec>
          ||                .                   .
          ||    base        V        step       V
        Gamma ----------->  X  <------------- N x X

(where, as in proof & type theory, I use Gamma for an arbitrary
object, or context of parameters).

If the category is cartesian closed then this diagram may be
rewritten with  the exponential  X^Gamma  in place of  X,  the
object Gamma itself being removed from the top line.

The corresponding recursion scheme is written symbolically as

    Gamma  |-  base : X        Gamma, n:N, x:X  |-  step (n,x) : X
    --------------------------------------------------------------
               Gamma, n:N  |-  rec (n, base, step) : X

with beta-rules
    Gamma       |-  rec (zero,    base, step) = base : X
    Gamma, n:N  |-  rec (succ(n), base, step) = step (n, rec (n, base, step))

By the way, we call this "recursion at type X", the point being that
as the class of types at which the recursion scheme is asserted grows,
so considerably does the power of the logic.

A similar generalisation is needed when we want to argue about equations:

 - I have terms     Gamma, n:N, x:X  |-  a_n,  b_n : X,

 - I prove a base case        Gamma  |-  a_0 = b_0 : X

 - and an induction step that
        Gamma, n:N, x:X,   a_n = b_n : X  |-    a_n+1 = b_n+1 : X

 - From these I want to deduce that   Gamma, n:N, x:X  |-  a_n = b_n : X
   without assumption.

Notice that I said nothing about how  a_n  and  b_n  themselves were
defined.  Indeed, if they had been defined by the same base and step
maps on X, they would be equal by the uniqueness hypothesis of the
universal property - otherwise known as the eta rule for recursion.


To give a simple example to show that we need more than this uniqueness,
let b_n=b be constant and
        a_0 = f u,  a_1 = f(s u),  a_2 = f(s(s(u)), etc
where
        f: X---> Y   and    s : Y ---> Y
so that the sequence  a_n  itself is not defined by an endofunction.

We can apply the ordinary recursion scheme to this example by considering
the subtype or equaliser
                                                  f
                                                ------>
        Z  =  { y:Y | f y = b }  >------>   Y          X
                                                ------>
                                                  b

since the endofunction  s : Y --> Y  restricts to  Z.

In fact, the general equational recursion scheme can be derived from
a different equaliser:
                                                          a_n
                                                        ------>
        E = { n:N | a_n = b_n : X}  >------> Gamma x N          X
                                                        ------>
                                                          b_n

The base case says that  zero : Gamma x N -> N  factors through E,
whilst the induction step says that  succ  restricts to  a map  E -> E.
Then the above parametric recursion scheme provides an inverse
        rec_E : Gamma x N ---> E
to the inclusion, one equation being given by uniqueness of
        rec_N : Gamma x N ---> Gamma x N
and the other by the fact that  E >--->  Gamma x N  is mono.


As you may have guessed, I became concerned by this issue because
I am interested in a certain category that does not have general
equalisers, so I will need to assert a more complicated recursion
scheme in my case.


These two generalisations of the beautifully simple Dedekind -- Peano
-- Lawvere definition of the natural numbers are beginning to feel
like the thin end of a wedge.  Presumably be have to make a further
alteration to the definition for every propositional and type
connective in our logic.

Alternatively,  we can consider the situation in set theory or an
elementary topos.  The equational recursion scheme is valid there
because we have equalisers, and we may consider in particular the case
where X = Omega is the subobject classifier and b_n=true.  This gives
Peano induction straight away.

We get from a given category to the topos situation by means of a
Yoneda embedding, though unfortunately not simply into a presheaf
topos or functor category. There has to be a Grothendieck topology to
make the representable object N from our category coincide with the
constant sheaf whose value is N from Set.

Actually, we can unwind this situation and re-express it in terms of
elementary category theory or type theory.  Let
        Gamma,  n:N  |-  phi(n)
be the predicate that we want to prove generally true by induction.

This predicate, like any term, may be shifted from one context Gamma
to another one Delta by a multiple substitution of a term using
variables from Gamma for each typed variable in Delta. Categorically,
this just means the composite

                    u x id              phi
        Delta x N  --------> Gamma x N -----> Omega

Now  phi  may actually be true in some particular context  Gamma,
but not in another one  Delta.    Those contexts in which it is true
form a category, or alternatively a sheaf or sieve on the original
category.  This sieve is the truth-value of phi in the sheaf topos.


I think symbolic logic has language for this situation, possibly
involving the word "realises", but I'm not sure at the moment what
this is.

Let S be this sieve.

Like E above, it has a map (natural transformation)  E ---> N.

If the sieve S is representable by an actual subobject of N in the
original category, the same argument as above provides an inverse
N ---> S, whence S is the whole of N.   (A sieve S is representable
by an object U if S consists of all of the maps into U).

We can see parametric and equational recursion in terms of this sieve.

In the equational case,   S  consists of all maps to Gamma x N that
have equal composites with  a_n  and  b_n.  The sieve is representable
iff it has a terminal object, which is called the equaliser.

In the parametric case,  the terminal object of the sieve is the
exponential   X^Gamma.


The general form of the recursion scheme in a category with weak logic
that we do not want to embed in a topos therefore appears to be this:

        N admits recursion at the sieve (cf type) S

for whatever generality of sieves we care to choose.

Since a sieve is the external manifestation of a subset in the topos,
what we have said is that any sieve (of the chosen generality) that
contains zero and is closed under successor is the whole of N.
In other words, N admits induction or is well founded with respect
to such sieves as predicates.

Maybe I've just answered my own question, but if someone else has
worked on this and written it up more fully then I would like to know.
