17th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2020)

June 1-5th, 2020. Paris-Saclay, France.

CALL FOR PAPER

The conference brings together researchers working on the mathematical
foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and related areas,
with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical tools,
category-theoretic structures, formal languages, semantic methods, and
other computer science techniques applied to the study of physical
behaviour in general. Work that applies structures and methods inspired
by quantum theory to other fields (including computer science) is also
welcome.

QPL 2020 will be co-located with the 36th Conference on the Mathematical
Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS 2020).

Our sponsors are : Atos, INRIA-Saclay, QuantFi.
Invited Speakers

      L??dia del Rio (ETH Zurich)
      Cyril Branciard (U. Grenoble-Alpes)
      Alexandre Miquel (U. de la Rep., Montevideo)
      Quanlong Wang (U. of Oxford)
      John Selby (Perimeter Institute, Waterloo)

Important dates

      Fri March 6: abstract submission
      Fri March 13: paper submission
      Sun April 19: notification of authors
      Tue April 21: application for student support
      Thu May 7: early registration deadline
      Fri May 15: final papers ready
      June 1-5: conference

Submission Guidelines

Prospective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the following:

    *  Original contributions consist of a 5-12 page extended abstract
that provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest and
enough detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the
work. Submission of substantial albeit partial results of work in
progress is encouraged.
    *  Extended abstracts describing work submitted/published elsewhere
will also be considered, provided the work is recent and relevant to the
conference. These consist of a 3 page description and should include a
link to a separate published paper or preprint.

The conference proceedings will be published in Electronic Proceedings
in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) after the conference. Only
"original contributions" are eligible to be published in the proceedings.

Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX, and must be submitted in PDF
format. Use of the EPTCS style is encouraged. Submission is done via
EasyChair: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qpl2020

There will be an award for the best student paper at the discretion of
the programme committee. Papers eligible for the award are those where
all the authors are students at the time of submission.
