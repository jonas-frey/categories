Learning category theory (which I did after I wrote a dissertation and
several papers in finite fields) certainly changed and improved the way I
did mathematics.  The change indeed deserves to be called a
transformation.  In a similar way, my ability to program in Basic improved
remarkably when I learned the basic ideas of structured programming and
did a little programming in Pascal.  But I am reasonably sure that these
transformations in my thinking occurred because I learned important new
concepts such as limit, adjoint, while-loop, etc.  Learning new concepts
transforms one's thinking.  I am not a linguist, but I know something of
Whorf's ideas; I don't understand how one can disentangle the effect of
knowing the different concepts that different cultures have from the
effect of knowing their language.

This brings up the question: Can concepts be differentiated from language?  
I say via introspection that the answer is "certainly", because when I
concentrate on a mathematical problem (or how to reassemble a machine or
write a complicated program) the "talking" in my head goes away and is
replaced by pictorial concepts located in mental space.  Some people claim
that this never happens to them.  If that is true, it would appear that
people come in two different varieties, from Mars and from Venus maybe.
But I suspect that the people who claim it never happens are simply wrong:
they lack sufficient introspective ability.
