Regarding Deniz Kural's question about references to papers on category
theory and biology, Tom Caudell and I have been investigating a semantic
theory for neural networks both biological and artificial, cognitive and
non-cognitive.  We are designing and conducting experiments to test and
refine the theory in both neuroscience and cognitive psychology working
with colleagues in those disciplines.  An initial paper on the theory is

M. J. Healy and T. P. Caudell (2006)
Ontologies and Worlds in Category Theory: Implications for Neural Systems=
,
Axiomathes, vol. 16, nos. 1-2, pp. 165-214.

The only experiment appearing in a publication to date is one on an
artificial neural network application, presented at IJCNN 2005 in Montrea=
l
(the results were presented also at CT06).

Mike Healy
