                15th International Conference on
   Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science (RAMiCS 2015)

           28 September to 1 October 2015, Braga, Portugal

                 URL:  http://ramics2015.di.uminho.pt

             ======= Student Track (PhD / MSc) =======

The RAMiCS Conference is the main forum for Relational and Algebraic Methods
in Computer Science. Special focus lies on formal methods for software engineering,
logics of programs and links with neighbouring disciplines.

If you are currently doing a PhD or an MSc in the research areas of the RAMiCS
conference, then please consider submitting a short description of your ongoing
work for presentation at the conference (if accepted). This is an excellent
opportunity to discuss your work with leading experts in this field.

Submissions for the student session should take the form of extended abstracts.
They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. They
need to be in English, in postscript or pdf format, not exceeding 6 pages
produced with LaTeX in Springer LNCS style to be found under
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

Student papers will not be published in the conference proceedings - they
will be bound into a technical report to become available from RepositoriUM,
the University of Minho's central on-line repository.

Send submissions to: mwinter.ca or jno.uminho.pt

Submission deadline: 03 July 2015

Author Notification: 17 July 2015
