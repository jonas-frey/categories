I was surprised by Thomas's previous post, because I knew that
if E has set-indexed copowers then Fam(E) can be identified with
the glueing of Delta, and is thus a topos. (I haven't seen Pieter
Hofstra's thesis, so I wasn't aware that he had made a different
claim.)

In fact set-indexed copowers in E (a slightly weaker condition
than cocompleteness, cf. A2.1.7 in the Elephant) is necessary as
well as sufficient for Fam(E) to be a topos. Here's a proof:

Let me write objects of Fam(E) in the form (I, (A_i | i \in I))
where I is a set and the A_i are objects of E. Noting that the
forgetful functor  sending (I,(A_i)) to I is represented by the
object (1,(0)) where 0 is the initial object of E, it's easy to
see that if Fam(E) is cartesian closed then objects of the form
(1,(A)) form an exponential ideal, i.e. any exponential
(1,(A))^(I,(B_i)) is of the form (1,(C)). In particular, if the
exponential (1,(A))^(I,(1 | i \in I)) exists, it is of the form
(1,(C)) where C is an I-fold power of A in E. So E has arbitrary
set-indexed powers; but E^op is monadic over E, so it also has
set-indexed powers, i.e. E has set-indexed copowers.
