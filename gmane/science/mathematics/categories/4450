  Dear Colleagues:

we are happy to announce the 2008 edition of

"Computability: Computable Functions, Logic, and the Foundations of=20
Mathematics"

Authors: Richard L. Epstein and Walter Carnielli
Publisher: Advanced Reasoning Forum, 2008

*3rd. Edition*

" Now in a new edition --the classic presentation of the theory of
computable functions in the context of the foundations of mathematics.
Part I motivates the study of computability with discussions and
readings about the crisis in the foundations of mathematics in the
early 20th century while presenting the basic ideas of whole number,
function, proof, and real number. Part II starts with readings from
Turing and Post leading to the formal theory of recursive functions.
Part III presents sufficient formal logic to give a full development
of G=F6del's incompleteness theorems. Part IV considers the significance
of the technical work with a discussion of Church's Thesis and
readings on the foundations of mathematics. This new edition contains
the timeline 'Computability and Undecidability' as well as the essay
'On Mathematics'. "
