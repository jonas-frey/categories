Walter,

I beg to differ only with

In my experience, skepticism towards category theory is often rooted in
the fear of the "illegitimately large" size, till today.

In my experience, disdain for cat theory is due to papers with a very
high density of unfamiliar names
reminiscent of the minutia of PST and the (in) famous comment (by some
one) about something like:
hereditary hemi-demi-semigroups with chain condition
