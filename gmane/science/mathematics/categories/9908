About CALCO and MFPS
------------------------

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with
interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging
uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science.

MFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and
computer science that are related to models of computation in general,
and to semantics of programming languages in particular.

This is a forum where researchers in mathematics and computer science
can meet and exchange ideas. The participation of researchers in
neighbouring areas is strongly encouraged.

CALCO EARLY IDEAS
---------------------

Until 17 May it is still possible to submit abstracts to the early
ideas track of CALCO on EasyChair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco19

Early ideas are abstracts that lead to presentation of work in progress
and original research proposals. PhD students and young researchers
are particularly encouraged to contribute.

Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs
http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/
(Note that there is a new version of the style: lipics-v2019).

The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on
the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged
to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere. At least
one of the authors must attend the conference to present the work.


REGISTRATION
----------------

The deadline for online registration is Thursday, 30 May 2019. Note that
it will be possible to register on site, but payment is then only
possible in cash.

Further information and the registration website can be found here:
