[note from moderator: it is quite possible that as result of a labour
dispute at Mount Allison University the categories list may be dormant for
an undetermined period. I will attempt to let you know and provide
alternate access to the list if this happens; thanks for your patience.

Copyright 1998 The Editors of Theory and Applications of Categories

THEORY AND APPLICATIONS OF CATEGORIES   (ISSN 1201-561X)
will disseminate articles
that significantly advance the study of categorical algebra or methods, or
that make significant new contributions to mathematical science using
categorical methods. The scope of the journal includes: all areas of
pure category theory, including higher dimensional categories; applications
of category theory to algebra, geometry and topology and other areas of
mathematics; applications of category theory to computer science, physics
and other mathematical sciences; contributions to scientific knowledge
that make use of categorical methods.
 
Articles appearing in the journal have been carefully and critically
refereed under the responsibility of members of the Editorial Board.
Only papers judged to be both significant and excellent are accepted for
publication.
 
The method of distribution of the journal is via the Internet tools
WWW/ftp. The journal is archived electronically and in
printed paper format.
