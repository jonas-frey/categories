                 WiL 2020: 4th Women in Logic Workshop
                                      virtual

Women in Logic 2020 is part of "Paris Nord Summer of LoVe 2020"
(https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/summer-of-love-2020/), a joint event on
LOgic and VErification, made of Petri Nets 2020, IJCAR 2020, FSCD 2020,
and over 20 satellite events.

The Women in Logic workshop (WiL) provides an opportunity to increase
awareness of the valuable contributions made by women in the area of
logic in computer science. Its main purpose is to promote the excellent
research done by women, with the ultimate goal of increasing their
visibility and representation in the community. Our aim is to:

- provide a platform for female researchers to share their work and
achievements;
- increase the feelings of community and belonging, especially among
junior faculty, post-docs and students through positive interactions
with peers and more established faculty;
- establish new connections and collaborations;
- foster a welcoming culture of mutual support and growth within the
logic research community.
We believe these aspects will benefit women working in logic and computer
science, particularly early-career researchers.

Previous versions of Women in Logic (Reykjavik, Iceland 2017,
Oxford, UK 2018 and Vancouver, Canada 2019) were very successful
in showcasing women's work and as catalysts for recognition of the
need for change in the community.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to: automata
theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,
concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,
constructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,
description logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects
of program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,
games and logic, higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi,
linear logic, logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming,
logical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational
complexity, logical aspects of quantum computation, logical
frameworks, logics of programs, modal and temporal logics, model
checking, probabilistic systems, process calculi, programming language
semantics, proof theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security
and privacy, rewriting, type systems and type theory, and
verification.
