Like Michael, I've occasionally been bothered by the conflict between
the two uses of "injective". However, for me it's the use of the word
as a dual for "projective" that feels wrong; the opposite of "pro" is
not "in" but "con" (or "contra"). Also, the use of "injective"
and "surjective" for maps is so well established throughout
mathematics that I don't think there is any chance of changing it.
I've thought of using "coprojective" for the dual of "projective";
but for anyone with a classical education that word means
"shit-throwing".
