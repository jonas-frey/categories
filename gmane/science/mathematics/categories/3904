Dear Fred,

If we are talking about funny things - all right, let us talk about funny
things:

I claim that there is exactly one pair (C,T) in which:

1. C is a category, and T is a monad on C;
2. the only adjoint situations giving rise to T are determined by the
Kleisli and the Eilenberg-Moore categories.

Even though "unfortunately", in this case the Kleisli and the
Eilenberg-Moore categories coincide.

In this unique pair C is the empty category. Indeed, if C is non-empty, then
take any category A with zero object and look at the projection
AxAlg(T) ---> Alg(T) composed with the forgetful functor Alg(T) ---> C. This
composite together with its obvious left adjoint will give rise to T.

Just coincidence of the Kleisli and the Eilenberg-Moore categories is
another story of course...

George Janelidze

NOt even the identity monad on SETS has this property, as it is
the adjunction monad also for the adjoint pair

[underlying pointset]: [topological spaces] --> SETS ,
[discrete topology on]: SETS --> [topological spaces] .

There ARE a few monads for which the Kleisli and E-M categories
"coincide," however, beyond the identity monads. First example
coming to mind is the FreeVectorSpace monad on SETS. I'm sure
other Categories-readers will point out more.
