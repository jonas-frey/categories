I have meet Dold only a couple of times.
He always made a big impression on me.

I remember very well his talk at the conference in honour of Samy =
Eilenberg in 1984.
He spoke on a categorical formulation of Lefschetz fixed points theorem =
using S-duality and trace.
It was a very beautiful mixture of category theory and topology.=20
He received a standing ovation for his talk!

He is one of my mathematical heros.

Albrecht Dold taught the algebraic topology course that I took in my =
first year as a graduate student.  His beautifully organized =
presentation of this material was largely responsible for my becoming =
interested in category theory.  He made both the power and the beauty of =
functors evident.
