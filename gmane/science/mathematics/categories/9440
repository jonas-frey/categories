Dear All,

I'm very interested in how categorial and material set theories
interact, and in particular the advantages of each.

It's well-known that categorial viewpoints are good for isolating
schematic structural relationships. We can look at sets through this
lens, by considering a categorial set theory like ETCS (possibly
augmented, e.g. with replacement). A remark one sometimes finds is
that once you have defined membership via arrows from terminal
objects, you could use ETCS for all the purposes to which ZFC is
normally put.

My question is the following:

(Q) To what extent can you ``do almost the same work'' with a
categorial set theory like ETCS vs. a material set theory like ZFC?

Just to give a bit more detail concerning what I'm thinking of:
Something material set theory is reasonably good at is building models
(say to analyse relative consistency), or comparing cardinality.
However, there's no denying that for representing abstract
relationships the language is somewhat clunky, since the same abstract
schematic type can be multiply instantiated by structures with very
different set-theoretic properties. So, to what extent can a
categorial set theory like ETCS supply the good bits of the fineness
of grain associated with material set theories, whilst modding out the
`noise'?

For example, the following are easily stated in material set theory:

1. \aleph_17 is an accessible cardinal.

In material set theory, it's easy to define the aleph function and
then state that the 17th position in this function can be reached by
iterating powerset and replacement. But I wouldn't even know how to
talk about specific sets of different cardinalities categorially. I
suppose you could say something in terms of isomorphism between
subobjects, and then exponentials, but it's quite unclear to me how
the specifcs would go. Is that an easily claim to state (and prove) in
ETCS?

2. How would you state that {{}} and {\beth_\omega} are very different
objects? Set-theoretically, these look very different (just consider
their transitive closures, for instance). But category-theoretically
they should look the same---since they are both singletons they are
isomorphic. So is this a case where their different set-theoretic
propeties are considered just `noise', or where ETCS just wouldn't see
a relationship, or where ETCS can in fact see some of these properties
(and I'm just missing something)?

3. How would ETCS deal with model theory and cardinality ascriptions?
(This links to a question asked earlier on this mailing list
concerning syntactic theories in category theory, and whether from the
categorial viewpoint we should be taking notice of them at all.) For
instance, it's an interesting theorem (for characterising structure)
that a first-order theory categorical in one uncountable power is
categorical in every uncountable power (Morley's Theorem). But I have
no idea how one might formalise this in something like ETCS---I know
of Makkai and Reyes textbook (which I am currently reading) on
categorial logic (where theories are represented by categories and
models by functors), but I don't see how you could get
categoricity-in-power claims out of the set up there. Can this be
done?

Any help and/or discussion would be greatly appreciated!

Best Wishes,

Neil
