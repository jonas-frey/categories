Dear Gregory,

I think the problem resides in what you mean by "no internal structure".
If by this you mean that the *set* of names has no internal structure,
then it's obviously impossible -- to require the set to have decidable
equality is to impose internal structure on it. But it's still possible
for the names themselves to be atomic: you can identify the set of names
with the set of natural numbers (which has lots of internal structure,
including decidable equality) without identifying the individual names
with von Neumann-style natural numbers (or Russell-style cardinals,
or ...)
