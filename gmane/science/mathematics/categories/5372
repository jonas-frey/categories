Dear  Andrew
The conceptual definition of lamba ring given by Andre',
(for which a presentation by useful but complicated identities=20
is  theorem rather than a definition) solves an important one of
a  generic class of problems that I proposed in the article that is=20
bundled with my thesis in TAC Reprints.

A simple pedagogically convincing example is given by the=20
following dialogue :
 I have an example of a general category C and a functor U from it to finit=
e sets;
moreover I have a particular object X in C : what information about X
can I find using U ? Well, you could count the points of U(X).Yes but
that is by no means all. The functor U has a group G of all natural
automorphisms, and so U can be lifted across the category of G-sets,
 thus  that number is actually a sum of more refined invariants
indexed by the subgroups of G.

The generic problem (for the doctrine of algebraic theories rather than
for the subdoctrine of permutation representations) considers a=20
specific assignment of an algebraic theory to any morphism of algebraic=20
theories (from Andre's example it should be clear which assignment) and ask=
s=20
for specific calculation (eg a presentation in terms of given presentations=
,
or indeed any information). The construction involves the natural structure
of a functor that is not representable in general but hope comes from
the  fact that this functor preserves filtered colimits and reflexive coequ=
alizers
and that some examples are representable or otherwise computable.

Bill
