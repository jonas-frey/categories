These discussions on trinity and similar seem to raise only irritation
where there would be opportunity to provide constructive discussions.

CT has done a good job in explaining and providing rigour. Some like it,
some don't. Type theory is a typical example where computer science is "on
its own", unless trying to understand trinity like suggestions. Take
'lambda', for instance. Church said already back in 1940 that 'lambda' is
an "improper symbol" and that his 'o' type for something in direction of
propositions, but Church says:

"We purposely refrain from making more definite the nature of the types o
and iota" (peklund: the 'type' type!) ", the formal theory admitting of a
variety of interpretations in this regard. Of course the matter of
interpretation is in any case irrelevant to the abstract construction of
the theory, and indeed other and quite different interpretations are
possible (formal consistency assumed)."

'Trinity' also raises irritation and even fear as it refers to the Holy
Trinitiy, and many feel very uncomfortable even talking about these
things.

The wordpress blog mentioned is also very shallow in its introduction,
just mentioning "manifest in three persons". Some may be interested to
look more into the relation of "the three" as it has been part of history
and e.g. the split of the Latin and Greek Churches. The so called Filioque
addition and why it happened, and how it appears in the Latin language is
far beyond just saying "manifests". The way Augustinus opposed Arianism
and his choices of 'language' is, I think, a bit interesting in this
context. Or maybe not.

Rigour to me is just being clear about what is what. For instance,
sentences build upon terms, and satisfaction/entailment needs sentences.
This shold mean we need to be precise about terms, and then closing that
door. Then we are precise about sentences, and closing that door, and so
on. We should somewhere along that path, e.g. after having closed the
"sentences door", come up with new and nice sentences still to be used.
G?del was doing that all the time.

We shouldn't, I think, allow "circadian rhythms" into science and
mathematics, in particular in type theory concerning how types and
propositions are "manifested" in each other.

Cheers,

Patrik
