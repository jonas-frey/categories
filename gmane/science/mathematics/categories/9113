Dear Jean,

My own understanding (superficial and possibly wrong) of the history is that=
  since Bourbaki there have been definitions of "structure" with the aim of r=
econciling the algebraic examples (where the homomorphisms preserve structur=
e) with the topological spaces (where the continuous maps have inverse image=
s that preserve structure). Certainly if you look at Joy of Cats, the prime c=
lasses of examples are those of topological and algebraic categories.

But, as we know from topos theory, it is not foundationally robust to treat t=
opological spaces as "sets with structure", i.e. point-set topology. In gene=
ral we have to work point-free, at least if we want to save important parts o=
f topology from going down the drain.

If such an important source of examples, the point-set topological spaces, t=
urned out to be misleading, then, in retrospect, any "precise meaning [of st=
ructure] on which the community of mathematicians agree", was probably misgu=
ided.

It's like looking for a definition of "fish", but on the understanding that i=
t has to include whales.

All the best,

Steve.
