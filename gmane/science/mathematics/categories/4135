   Computability in Europe 2008: Logic and Theory of Algorithms
                 University of Athens, June 15-20 2008
                    http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/cie08/


PAPER SUBMISSION is now OPEN:
            http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/cie08/submission.php

SUBMISSION DEADLINE:
            January 4th, 2008


CiE 2008 is the fourth in a series of conferences organised by CiE
(Computability in Europe), a European network of mathematicians,
logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and
others interested in new developments in computability and their
underlying significance for the real world. Previous meetings took
place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006) and Siena (2007).

CiE 2008 aims at bridging the gap from the logical methods of
mathematical and meta-mathematical flavour to the applied and
industrial questions that are involved in devising and choosing
the right algorithms and analysing their effectiveness and efficiency.


TUTORIALS will be given by:
John V. Tucker (Swansea)
Moshe Y. Vardi (Houston, TX)

PLENARY SPEAKERS will include:
Keith Devlin (Stanford, CA)
Rosalie Iemhoff (Utrecht)
Antonina Kolokolova (Vancouver, BC)
Janos Makowsky (Haifa)
Dag Normann (Oslo)
Prakash Panangaden (Montreal, QC)
Christos Papadimitriou (Berkeley, CA)
Jan van Leeuwen (Utrecht) & Jiri Wiedermann (Prague)
