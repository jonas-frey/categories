The equivalence of these varieties for all p is well known. It's best
understood by seeing that they are all dual to the category of Stone
spaces: given a Stone space, the ring of continuous Z_p-valued functions
on it (where Z_p is given the discrete topology) is a ring satisfying
p1=0 and x^p=x; conversely, given such a ring, its prime (=maximal)
ideal spectrum is a Stone space.

Not having my copy of "Stone Spaces" to hand as I write this, I can't
remember whether this fact was in the book. But it certainly should have
been.
