Since Ladj(Span) is essentially Set, we would need, for every set b, 
a set pb such that for every a, the large category of spans a -|-> b 
is equivalent to the small discrete category of functions a --> pb. 
This doesn't work. 

[Just to avoid a possible misunderstanding: if B is a bicategory, then 
by Ladj(B) I mean the locally full subbicategory of B with the same 
objects as B and whose 1-cells are left adjoints in B. Katis and Walters 
have a paper which uses the same notation Ladj(B) for something else.]
