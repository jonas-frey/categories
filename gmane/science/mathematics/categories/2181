          First Announcement and Call for Papers


AIMS AND SCOPE. The Third AMAST Workshop on Algebraic Methods in
Language Processing, AMiLP-3, is aimed at collecting state-of-art
approaches and results in formal language theory, programming
language theory and natural language theory.
  Like its predecessors, held in 1995 at the University of Twente,
Enschede, the Netherlands, and in 2000 at the University of Iowa,
Iowa City, USA, the workshop is organized jointly within the Twente
Workshop in Language Processing (TWLT) series.

TOPICS. Research contributions are sought in all aforementioned
areas of language theory, as well as other areas of language theory
and language processing, including, but not limited to: formal
specification and analysis, relational and higher-order languages
and calculi, man-machine interaction languages, graphic and visual
languages, dialogue modeling, language translation, languages for
concurrent and mobile computing, new and emerging specification and
programming paradigms. A common feature of work relevant to the
workshop is the use of mathematical concepts, in particular the
use of an algebraic approach. Due to this, traditional boundaries
between the areas may disappear, allowing researchers to learn
from areas that were uncommon to them before.

SUBMISSIONS. Papers are sought describing original research work,
even if in progress or under tentative approaches. Initially we ask
you to submit a max. 4-page extended abstract. These contributions
will be evaluated by the Program Committee and selected on basis
of originality, significance, and relevance to the workshop aims.
Authors of accepted contributions will have the opportunity to
expand them to a max. 15-page full paper, for inclusion in the
proceedings of the workshop. Contributions are to be submitted
electronically, in PDF or printable PostScript format, either
through the workshop website or by e-mail (to either PC Chair or
to the PC Secretary, see below).

IMPORTANT DATES. Abstract submission: 14 March, 2003
                 Notification:        14 April, 2003
                 Full version:        11 July, 2003
                 Early registration:  25 July, 2003
                 AMiLP-3 workshop:    25-27 August, 2003

PROCEEDINGS. There will be a participants' proceedings volume in
the TWLT series published by the University of Twente, containing
the full papers, which will be made available at the workshop.
For previous volumes in the series see URL:
http://parlevink.cs.utwente.nl/Conferences/twltseries.html
If there will be enough contributions of sufficiently high quality,
a selection of the presented papers will be considered for
publication in a journal special issue, as it happened with the
previous editions of the workshop.
