CiE 2015:  3rd CfP - EXTENDED DEADLINE and BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARD
------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS (incl. deadline extension due to popular demand)

3rd CALL FOR PAPERS:
COMPUTABILITY IN EUROPE 2015: Evolving Computability
Bucharest, Romania
June 29 - July 3
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/


************************************************************************
IMPORTANT DATES:

EXTENDED Submission Deadline for LNCS: 21 January 2015
Notification of authors: 9 March 2015
Deadline for final revisions: 6 April 2015

************************************************************************

CiE 2015 is the 11-th conference organized by CiE (Computability in
Europe), a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer
scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested in new
developments in computability and their underlying significance for
the real world. Previous meetings have taken place in Amsterdam (2005),
Swansea (2006), Siena (2007), Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009),
Ponta Delgada (2010), Sofia (2011), Cambridge (2012), Milan (2013)
and Budapest (2014)

Evolution of the universe, and us within it, invite a parallel
evolution in understanding. The CiE agenda - fundamental and engaged -
targets the extracting and developing of computational models basic
to current challenges. From the origins of life, to the understanding
of human mentality, to the characterising of quantum randomness -
computability theoretic questions arise in many guises. The CiE
community, this coming year meeting for the first time in Bucharest,
carries forward the search for coherence, depth and new thinking
across this rich and vital field of research.

In all cases we are looking for fundamental and theoretical submissions.
In line with other conferences in this series, CiE 2015 has a broad
scope and provides a forum for the discussion of theoretical and
practical issues in Computability with an emphasis on new paradigms
of computation and the development of their mathematical theory.

We particularly invite papers that build bridges between different
parts of the research community.

For topics covered by the conference, please visit
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/topics.html

AWARDS:

The best student paper award is presented to the author(s) of the
best paper, as selected by the PC, written solely by student author(s).
This award is sponsored by Springer.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES:

CiE 2015 has received funding from  ASL (Association for Symbolic
Logic) and EATCS (European Association for Theoretical Computer Science)
that allows students who are members of ASL or EATCS and want to attend
CiE 2015 to apply for travel funds or a reduction of the early
registration fee.

Preference will be given to presenters of accepted papers.

Applications for ASL travel grants have to be addressed directly to
ASL, with a strict deadline of March 28, 2015.

Applications for EATCS travel grants have to be sent to
cie2015@fmi.unibuc.ro
prior to the early registration deadline.
