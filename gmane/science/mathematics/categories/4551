There are no

Indeed on 8/17, 8/26, and 8/27  I urged the continuation of the development
of Chen's theory (for example the smooth space of piecewise smooth paths),
making use of recent experience of the range of possible categories.


It is possible that

But a proof would require a definition of what is meant by infinitesimals,
as well as the constraint on the framework that the maps 1->R and R->R
are the standard ones. Otherwise nonstandard analysis might fit.
The nilpotents or germs capture the Heraclitian nature of motion in a way
that abstract sets do not directly.


The misplaced concreteness, according to which

          >spaces are [single] sets equipped with extra structure

is only a "second aspect of the default paradigm. The first aspect,
successfully overcome by the named pioneers, is the one generalizing the
default category of topological spaces (or locales). Here "default" refers
to the habitual response to the frequently occurring need to specify a
background category of cohesion in which to interpret our algebra.
The generalization from Sierpinski-valued functions (open sets) to
real-valued, has also been proposed, but that sort of
attempt never succeeded in yielding a simple theory of map spaces.
In contrast to this "function-algebra X/R as primary" paradigm,
the semi-dual "figure-geometry S/X as primary" has led to good map
spaces (including internal function algebras) for many authors
(Sebastiao e Silva, Fox, Hurewicz 60 years ago and several more recent).
I believe that attempting to force nearly-perfect duality has in general
not led to good results, but of course one studies the extent to which
a monad (presumed identity on models S) approximates the identity on
general spaces. For example, Froelicher=E2=80=99s duality condition applies not
only to the line R but to the function space R^R, a non-trivial fact about
the smooth case, derived by LSZ from a study of distributions of compact
support (so citing it is not just name-dropping).
