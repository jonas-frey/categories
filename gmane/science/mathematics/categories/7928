I don't know about the second question, but first let point out that that
is not the definition of a compact closed category.  A compact closed
category requires that A -o B = A*\otimes B.  This is true in finite
dimensional vector spaces (and the tensor unit is the dualizing object).
But the tensor unit is the dualizing object in Chu(Vect,K) where Vect is
the category of vector space and K is the ground field.  The dualizing
object and tensor unit is (K,K) but it is not compact.  It is, of course,
*-autonomous.

Does this also yield an isomorphism between A and B (assuming that the first result is adequate)? Or is it possible to add some axioms that are not necessarily isomorphisms?
