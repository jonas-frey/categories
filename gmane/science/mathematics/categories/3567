This site lists a lot of algebraic structures and often gives  
information on finite examples:

     http://math.chapman.edu/cgi-bin/structures

-----
Thus, for commutative rings (with 1) you have:

http://math.chapman.edu/structuresold/files/ 
Commutative_rings_with_identity.pdf

where you can find that there are:

- 1 structure with 1 element (or 2, 3, 5, 6 elements)
- 4 structures with 4 elements.

-----
The case of semirings is not (yet?) much developed: just a few  
results and trivial examples.
See:

http://math.chapman.edu/structuresold/files/ 
Semirings_with_identity_and_zero.pdf
http://math.chapman.edu/structuresold/files/Semirings_with_zero.pdf

-------
Commutative semirings are not in the list, I think.
