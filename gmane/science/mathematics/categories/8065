Hi all,

I am writing to announce a short series of expository talks to take =
place in Cambridge, England on Sunday June 29th (the arrival day for =
CT2014) starting no earlier than 2pm and finishing in time for the =
welcome reception. The exact location will be announced later.

The talks will be given by members of the Kan Extension Seminar:

www.math.harvard.edu/~eriehl/kan

We are currently half-way through an online category theory reading =
course with the following syllabus. The links are to expository blog =
posts written by the students.

* Lawvere, An elementary theory of the category of sets

.html
* Street, The formal theory of monads

* Blackwell-Kelly-Power, Two-dimensional monad theory
* Ad=E1mek-Borceux-Lack-Rosick=FD, A classification of accessible =
categories
* Lack, Codescent objects and coherence
* Shulman, Enriched indexed categories

The June talks will highlight some main theorems from the papers listed =
above and are aimed at all levels. I highly encourage anyone who finds =
themselves in Cambridge a few hours early to attend. My students are =
