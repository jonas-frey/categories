mentioned Semadeni _Banach spaces of continuous functions_ as using a
categorical perspective.  Maybe that is the book I need.

I want to understand Grothendieck's functional analysis in more detail
than just to say he used categorical definitions of different tensor
products to explain Fredholm kernels.  For a start, I know nothing about
Fredholm kernels except what is on Wikipedia.  Grothendieck's own
writings on it are long and start with many definitions so that it is
hard for me to see the point -- he even says in Recoltes et Semailles
that he never really *felt* the point but did it as an assignment.  So
that work shows nothing like the very clear motivation he gives for
schemes and etale cohomology in SGA.

What is a good introduction to his contributions in functional analysis?

best, Colin
