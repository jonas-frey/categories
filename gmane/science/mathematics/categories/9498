                        London, Ontario, Canada

The Department of Mathematics at the University of Western Ontario
solicits applications for its MSc and PhD programs.  We have up to
15 fully funded positions available, and applicants from any country
are welcome.

Our faculty members supervise research in a variety of areas:

More information about our program, including the application
procedure, is available at

   http://www.math.uwo.ca/graduate/

Students normally start in September, in which case applications should
be complete (including letters of reference and supplementary material)
by February 15.  Applications received after this deadline will be
reviewed as space permits.  We encourage applicants to apply for
external scholarships they are eligible for.

Please contact math-grad-program@uwo.ca with any questions you may have.
