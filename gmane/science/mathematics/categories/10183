SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

3rd Annual International Conference on

Applied Category Theory

(ACT2020)

July 6 =E2=80=93 10, 2020

http://act2020.mit.edu


           * * *


Applied category theory is a topic of interest for a growing community of
researchers interested in studying many different kinds of systems using
category-theoretic tools. These systems are found across computer science,
mathematics, and physics, as well as in social science, linguistics,
cognition, and neuroscience. The background and experience of our members
is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the Applied Category
Theory conference is to provide a platform for researchers in the area to
discuss recent progress.

We seek submissions of both original research papers and extended abstracts
of work that's been submitted, accepted, or published elsewhere. Original
research papers we accept will be invited for publication in a proceedings
volume. Some contributions will be invited to become keynote addresses, and
best paper award(s) may also be given.

ACT2020 will be held entirely online, with all the attendant advantages: no
registration fee, no need to travel, etc. It will consist of three 2-hour
sessions per day, spaced the clock to accommodate the different time zones
of our speakers. All the talks will be both live streamed and recorded on
YouTube. Our goal is a conference that provides high quality, interactive
talk sessions; generative, high bitrate discussions; and serendipitous
interactions with new people.

The conference will include a business showcase, and it will be preceded by
a tutorial day.


This event follows ACT2018 in Leiden, and ACT2019 in Oxford.


** IMPORTANT DATES (all in 2020)**

Submission of contributed papers: Sunday May 10

Success notification: Sunday June 7

Tutorial day: July 5

Main conference: July 6 =E2=80=93 10


** SUBMISSIONS **

Two types of submissions are accepted, both of which will be reviewed

using the same standards:

  - Proceedings Track. Original contributions of high-quality work

consisting of a 5 =E2=80=93 12 page extended abstract that provides evidenc=
e of

results of genuine interest, and with enough detail to allow the

program committee to assess the merits of the work. Submission of a

work-in-progress is encouraged, but it must be more substantial than a

research proposal.

  - Non-Proceedings Track. Descriptions of high-quality work submitted

or published elsewhere will also be considered, provided the work is

recent and relevant to the conference. The work may be of any length,

but the program committee members may only look at the first 3 pages

of the submission, so you should ensure that these pages contain

sufficient evidence of the quality and rigor of your work.

Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX, and must be submitted in

PDF format. The submission link is available on the ACT2020 web page.
