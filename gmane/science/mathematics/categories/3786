In my last email I quoted Dirac and Agnes Boskovitz of ANU asked me for =
a reference. In fact I have quoted before in `Out of Line'=20

"Mathematics also leads science. The great physicist, Paul Dirac, in one =
of=20
his last addresses, explained his own credo (quoted in [12] p.63):
  "One should allow oneself to be led in the direction which the =
mathematics=20
suggests... one must follow up a mathematical idea and see what its=20
consequences are, even though one gets led to a domain which is =
completely=20
foreign to what one started with.... Mathematics can lead us in a =
direction=20
we would not take if we only followed up physical ideas by themselves."

[12] Ferris, T., The world treasury of physics, astronomy and =
mathematics,=20
Little, Brown and Co., 1991.

The quotation is in the article in this volume taken from `The second =
creation' by R.P. Crease and C.C. Mann (Macmillan, 1986).=20

I do not have any more information than that and any more would be =
welcome.=20
