I would like to say that I found Thomas' notes on fibred categories very
useful in showing me the importance of these ideas as a general view of
some key processes in the book
"Nonabelian algebraic topology: crossed complexes, filtered spaces,
cubical homotopy groyupoids" RB, P.J. Higgins, R. Sivera, EMS Tract
vol15 (2011).

In homotopy theory identifications in low dimensions can strongly affect
higher dimensional homotopy invariants.  One way of dealing with this is
to have algebraic  homotopy invariants which have structure in a range
of dimensions. Then we have  forgetful functors from dimension n to
lower dimensions.  In the cases we deal with, these functors are
bifibrarions, and so general properties of these are helpful  in
formalising  a number of elementary but useful calculational facts.
This general approach is given in Appendix B of the above book (of which
EMS allow a pdf to be available on my web page).

As a simple example, the functor Ob from groupoids to sets is a
bifibration. The general theory  shows how this is useful in calculating
colimits of groupoids in  applications of the fundamental groupoid
version of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem. This model is also useful in
higher dimensions.

I would like to be shown  applications of the more advanced theory of
fibred and cofibred categories to these areas!
