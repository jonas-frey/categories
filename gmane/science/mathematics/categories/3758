Fellow category theorists,

The 86th edition of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will =20=

be held at the Institut =C9lie Cartan of the Universit=E9 Henri Poincar=E9=
 =20
in Nancy, on the weekend of September 8-9 2007.

More details will be announced later this summer, but interested =20
people can start contacting me now. We intend to continue the PSSL =20
tradition of informality, and scheduling talks pertaining to any =20
aspect of category theory, with or without applications in natural =20
science, logic, computer science, or other branches of mathematics.

The fast TGV-Est  train line will be inaugurated in June, and the =20
Paris-Nancy trip will then take only 1h30m, with easy connections to =20
the two Paris airports. The city of Nancy is right on the Paris-=20
Munich train line, and also has good train connecftions with the =20
north (Luxembourg, Brussels and Frankfurt via Metz) and the south =20
(Lyon, Nice...). There is a local airport, 45 minutes away from =20
downtown by minibus shuttle, and there are also two relatively close =20
international airports, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, which often allow =20
you to do the airport-dowtown Nancy trip in less than 2h30m.

Nancy is of considerable interest for the mathematical tourist, being =20=

the birthplace of Henri Poincar=E9, and being intimately related to the =20=

career of Nicolas Bourbaki.  It has two historical old towns: the =20
medieval one, with the Renaissance palace of the Dukes of Lorraine, =20
and the classical one, with UNESCO World heritage sites built by Duke =20=

Stanislas. It is can also boast one of the highest concentrations of =20
Art Nouveau architecture in all of Europe, rivalling Prague and =20
Barcelona.


Hoping to see you in September,

Fran=E7ois Lamarche
