Dear All,
There is an interesting old result on fibrations that may shed light on
this.  It is well known  that if $F\to E\to B$ is a fibration of pointed
spaces then $\pi_1 F \to \pi_1 E$ is a crossed module and in fact any
crossed module can be  given in this form. Now one tries to prove it.
First the action: take a loop   g in E and another a in F. concatentate
to get  gag^{-1}.  This is a loop in E whose image in the base,B, is
null homotopic.  Pick a null homotopy that does this.  Lift it to a
homotopy in E starting at gag^{-1} using the homotopy lifting property
of the fibration.  Evaluate the other end of the lift.  This is a loop
in F. The corresponding element of \pi_1 F is the result of acting on
the class of a by the class of g.
Note the way the action is determined up to homotopy.  The verification
that the rules work up to homotopy is left as an exercise.

I learnt this from a paper by Eric Friedlander, who attributed it to
Deligne.  I suspect it is already essentially in Whitehead's
Combinatorial Homotopy II paper or Peter Hilton's lovely little book on
Homotopy Theory.

It suggests a `homotopy everything' version of crossed module, not just
a lax one.  Its advantage is that it clearly links up the structure with
the quite classical topological version of fibrations and so should be
adaptable to other situations.

Hope this helps.

Tim
