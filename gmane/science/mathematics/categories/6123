Dear David,

[This reply never made it to the list and i got a note from Bob
Rosebrugh about text-only messages and no attachments. i've a feeling
that the gmail client did something strange with my reply -- since i
thought everything i typed was predominantly ASCII. The following
version of the original reply should be just plain ASCII.]

Arguably, the two best approaches are Interaction Categories
(Abramsky, et al) and Bi-graphs (Milner, et al). The crucial concern
is to align categorical composition with parallel composition in a
manner that respects Curry-Howard. Thus, processes must be interpreted
as morphisms. The central complication is how to do this in a setting
supporting a natural interpretation of mobility, i.e. the dynamic
reconfiguration of communication topology. As an example, consider the
pi-calculus process,

*(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) | (new x)u!(x).x?(y).P

Find below one of it's reductions. The process represents a simplified
model of a little mini-protocol we use on the internet every day: on
some well known URL (the channel u above) ask for a unique (and
potentially private) URL (the channel w above) on which to do further
communication.

A categorical interpretation (meeting the desiderata above) needs to
interpret -- for example --

1) *(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) as a morphism, say [| *(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) |]

2) (new x)u!(x).x?(y).P as a morphism, say [| (new x)u!(x).x?(y).P |] and

3) *(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) | (new x)u!(x).x?(y).P as a morphism, say [|
*(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) | (new x)u!(x).x?(y).P |]

such that

[| *(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) | (new x)u!(x).x?(y).P |]
=
[| *(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) |] o [| (new x)u!(x).x?(y).P |]

Sangiorgi, Fiore and others have given fully abstract interpretations
meeting these criteria, by the letter of the law, so to speak. Imho,
one would never use any of these semantic accounts to do calculations
of properties of even these simple protocols. That's the sense in
which i mean that parallel composition does not line up well with
categorical composition. The "semantic" categorical account doesn't
help clarify things. It doesn't aid practical calculation. For
concurrent computation the process calculi still have greater utility
for both practical calculations theoretical framework supplying a
robust notion of equivalence and substitutability (i.e.,
bisimulation).

One reduction of the example process.

*(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) | (new x)u!(x).x?(y).P
->
*(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) | u?(v).(new w)v!(w) | (new x)u!(x).x?(y).P
=
*(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) | (new x)(u?(v).(new w)v!(w) | u!(x).x?(y).P)
->
*(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) | (new x)((new w)x!(w) | x?(y).P)
=
*(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) | (new x)((new w)(x!(w) | x?(y).P))
->
*(u?(v).(new w)v!(w)) | (new x)((new w)(P{w/y}))



Best wishes,
