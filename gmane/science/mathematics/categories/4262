Vaughan P.,

vp> ... "never heard of Wikipedia."   When five people
tell you x is the answer to your question, ...

I appreciate your exasperation.  Am afraid
that almost everyone who replied to my question
is severely over-estimating my state of
comprehension.  My background is primarily in
engineering and physics, whereas most of you
teach at the honours undergraduate and graduate
levels.

At present I am trying to understand the concept of
map object and the exercises on pp. 314 and 315 of L&S.
Long ago, a professional mathematician, as you all
are, advised: When stuck, find examples until you
come to an understanding.  Presently I am looking
for examples illustrating Exercises 1-6.  Fred's
reply is a good start.  Longer chains suggested by
Matt H. will be interesting, if not necessary.

Skipping ahead 34 pages, I see that map objects
are an ingredient of a topos.  A scan of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyting_algebra
reports that "map object" is not in the page.
Perhaps it should be.  Neverthless, working
through the book systematically seems more
promising than reading about toposes and Heyting
algebras before understanding map objects.

fwl> ... Heyting's Algebras and one of their
possible objective origins. The 2nd edition
should correct this omission.

I don't want to be presumptuous, but if some
of the tiny categories mentioned by Fred and
Matt can also fit into the second edition, that
would certainly interest me.  Without this
text, my endeavour to learn category th. would
be quite a battle.  Thanks!

I should have explained at the beginning,
the intention in seeking the examples.  Sorry
for the aggravation.

Regards,          ... Peter E.
