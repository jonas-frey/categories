Dear category theorist-

Below is a reminder for the "Summer School on Contemporary Categorical=20
Methods in Algebra and Topology". Anybody interested to participate in=20
the School is encouraged to email me before the end of this month.=20
Suggestions for contributed papers will also be considered by the=20
Scientific Committee. The info is also available on my webpage at
http://www.math.yorku.ca/~tholen/

Regards,
Walter Tholen.


                                              SUMMER SCHOOL ON
 CONTEMPORARY CATEGORICAL METHODS IN ALGEBRA AND TOPOLOGY

                                    Haute-Bodeux, Belgium, 3-10 June 2007

In the tradition of previous meetings held at this location, a Summer=20
School on Contemporary Categorical Methods in Algebra and Topology will=20
be held in Haute-Bodeux, a village in the Ardennes region of south-east=20
Belgium, from June 3 (arrival day) until June 10, 2007 (departure day).=20
Participants will stay in the "Hostellerie Doux-Repos"

http://hotels.belgium-bookings.com/hotel/be/hostellerie-doux-repos.html?l=
abel=3Dgl-hotels-Hostellerie-Doux-Repos

or nearby guestrooms, all meals will be taken in the Hostellerie - which=20
is known for its excellent cuisine. The primary aim of the meeting is to=20
provide students and young researchers who already have a working=20
knowledge of categories with an opportunity to learn about various=20
topics of interest in categorical algebra and topology, including

- categorical and topological aspects of semi-abelian theories,
- categorical descent and Galois theory,
- accessible categories and their applications to homotopy theory,
- lax-algebraic methods in categorical topology.

However, more established researchers in nearby fields who wish to=20
enhance their knowledge on these topics or present a paper are also=20
welcome. Lecture series will be given by the following researchers who=20
constitute the Scientific Committee of the meeting:

- Maria Manuel Clementino
- Dominique Bourn
- George Janelidze
- Jiri Rosicky
- Walter Tholen.

The local organizer of the Summer School is Francis Borceux (Universit=E9=
=20
Catholique de Louvain). It is estimated that the total cost of the=20
meeting will be about 975 Euros per person: this covers the registration=20
fee, transportation from and to Brussels airport or Li=E8ge railway=20
station (on the designated arrival and departure days), accommodation=20
and meals (including conference dinner and drinks with meals), social=20
activities and an excursion (excluding dinner on the excursion day).=20
Unfortunately, the organizers do not have funds available to provide any=20
financial support.

Accommodation in Haute-Bodeux is strictly limited, and attendance at the=20
meeting will be by invitation only. However, anyone who wishes to be=20
considered for invitation, or to propose names of people who might be=20
invited, is asked to send an e-mail to Walter Tholen=20
<tholen@mathstat.yorku.ca> <mailto:tholen@mathstat.yorku.ca> before the=20
end of September 2006. It is expected that invitations will be sent out=20
early in November 2006. Those invited will be sent formal letters of=20
invitation to assist them in obtaining funding, and will also be=20
provided with a reading list of material which may be assumed in the=20
Summer School lectures.
