----------------------------------------------------------------------
     A postdoctoral position in the PPS lab in Paris
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A postdoctoral position is available at our PPS laboratory
in Paris for the next academic year.

The position is supported by the ANR project RECRE
"Realizability for classical logic, concurrency, references
and rewriting" which brings together researchers
working in four different sites: the LIP at ENS Lyon,
PPS at University Paris Diderot, IML in Marseille
and LAMA in Chambery.

The scientific goal of the project consists in investigating
syntactic as well as semantic models of computations
based on realizability, and to understand their connection
to imperative and concurrent programming languages,
as well as to advanced type systems (typically dependent).

More information on the ANR RECRE is available at
http://recre.ens-lyon.fr/description

Requirements are a PhD degree in Computer Science
or Mathematics and a strong background in some
of the following topics:
- realizability (classical realizability, forcing)
- proof theory (dependent types, classical logic, linear logic)
- semantics of effects (monadic effects, algebraic theories)
- categorical semantics (realizability topos, homotopy type theory)

The position is starting fall 2013 for one year. The salary is standard
french postdoc, with benefits such as health insurance.

Applications must include a research statement, a CV and the names
and contacts of references. All material should be sent by email to:
curien@pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr
herbelin@pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr
mellies@pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr

Important dates:

- Intention of application (short email)    as soon as possible
- Deadline for application                         August  1st, 2013
- Suggested starting dates                       Sep.-Dec. 2013
