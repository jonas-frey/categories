You mention the exponential object, so I am not sure if you already know
the following suggested answer.

Monoidal closed structures are defined on certain kinds of cubical
omega-groupoids with connections in joint papers

48.  (with P.J. HIGGINS), ``Tensor products and homotopies for
$\omega$-groupoids and crossed complexes'', {\em J. Pure Appl.
Alg.} 47 (1987) 1-33.

and for categories by an analogous process in

116. (with F.A. AL-AGL and R. STEINER), `Multiple categories: the
equivalence between a globular and cubical approach', Advances in
Mathematics, 170 (2002) 71-118.

A kind of "decollage", dropping dimension by 1, is given by taking the
path object PC of a cubical object C, and this essentially drops each
cell by 1, as you ask.  Cubical objects are convenient for this
exponential method for the usual reason, that I^m x I^n \cong I^{m+n}.
Equivalences with other kinds of structures then enable the translation,
at least in principle.

Thierry Coquand has used cubical methods in his work on homotopy type
theory.

Best wishes

Ronnie
PS While I am writing I might as well mention
