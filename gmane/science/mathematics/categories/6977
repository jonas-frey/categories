Dear categorists,

Suppose you have categories A, B, C, and functors S,S': A-->B, T,T':
B-->C, and natural transformations alpha: S==>S', beta: T==>T'.
Suppose we want to see these as part of a 2-category of categories;
then we had better know the horizontal composite of alpha and beta.
There are two possible ways to evaluate this composite: as the natural
transformation having components beta_{S'X}.T(alpha_X), and as the
natural transformation having components T'(alpha_X).beta_{S(X)}. But
these are equal, since beta is a natural transformation. So we have no
difficulty uniquely defining our horizontal composite, and obtaining a
canonical 2-category of categories.

But now suppose that A, B, C are bicategories, S,S',T,T' are
pseudofunctors, and alpha and beta are pseudonatural transformations.
Then the two possible definitions for the horizontal composite of
alpha and beta will not necessarily be equal, although of course they
will be related by an invertible modification. But then we have a
problem forming the tricategory of bicategories, pseudofunctors,
pseudonatural transformations and modifications: there is no longer a
canonical choice available for horizontal composition of pseudonatural
transformations.

Presumably this choice can be made, and a tricategory is the result,
and different choices yield equivalent tricategories. But it bothers
me that there seems to be no canonical tricategory of bicategories.
Should it? Or is my reasoning flawed?

Jamie.
