Yes there is an error; but, more importantly, you are not answering
the original question.


Regarding the error, your argument is as follows. You start off with
a Cauchy sequence a = (a_i) of rationals between 0 and 1. Using this
you claim to find a binary expansion X such that X = lim a.
Your construction of X is by:

 > now let X be the binary number such that its first i digits are the

This is not a valid intuitionistic definition, because the property
of ending in an infinite sequence of 1s is not (logically) decidable.

In fact,the internal statement that every Cauchy real in [0,1] has
a binary expansion fails in many toposes (e.g. it fails in the
effective topos).

As is well known, this can be easily patched by, e.g., allowing 1/2
as an extra digit in binary expansions. Then one does obtain that
every Cauchy real (in [0,1]) has such an "extended" binary expansion.


However, none of this addresses the original question:

For this question, one must first construct the Cauchy reals R_C,
e.g. as Cauchy sequences quotiented by equivalence, or,
equivalently, as extended binary representations quotiented by
equivalence.

The question is: does every Cauchy sequence (x_i) in R_C have a
limit in R_C?

Here we are not starting off with a Cauchy sequence of rationals;
not even a Cauchy sequence of Cauchy sequences. Instead (x_i)
is a Cauchy sequence of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences.
To construct a limit, one apparently needs some choice to
select representatives from each x_i. Thus it appears that
the Cauchy completeness of R_C should fail in general. We
would like to have an example of a topos in which it does
fail. (Of course if there exists one such example then it
also fails in the free topos with nno, but this is no help.)
