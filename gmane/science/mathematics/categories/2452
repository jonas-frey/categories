The motivation for introducing 40 years ago the construction,
of which "categories of elements" is a special case, was to make clear the
elementary nature of the notion of adjointness. Given an opposed pair
of functors between two arbitrary given categories, one obviously
elementary way of providing them with an adjointness is to give two
natural transformations satisfying two equations; but very useful also is
the definition in terms of bijections of hom sets which should be
equivalent. The frequent mode for expressing the latter in terms of
presheaf categories involved the complicated logical notion of "smallness"
and the additional axiom that a category of small sets actually exists,
but had the disadvantage that it would therefore not apply to arbitrarily
given categories. By contrast, a formulation of this bijection in terms of
discrete fibrations required no such additional apparatus and was
universally applicable.

Unfortunately, since I had given the construction no name, people in
reading it began to use the unfortunate term "comma". It would indeed be
desirable to have a more objective name for such a basic construction.
(The notation involving the comma was generalized from the very special
case when the two functors to B, to which the construction is applied,
both have the category 1 as domain, and the result of the construction is
the simple hom set in B between the two objects, which is often denoted by
placing a comma between the names of the objects and enclosing the whole
in parentheses.)

One habit which it would be useful to drop is that of agonizing over the
true definition of elements. In any category the elements of an object B
are the maps with codomain B, these elements having various forms which
are their domains. For example, if the category has a terminal object, we
have in particular the elements often called punctiform. On the other
hand, it is often appropriate to apply the term point to elements more
general than that, for example, in algebraic geometry over a
non-algebraically closed field, points are the elements whose forms are
the spectra of extensions of the ground field. As Volterra remarked
already in the 1880s, the elements of a space are not only points, but
also curves, etc.; it is often convenient to use the term "figure" for
elements whose forms belong to a given subcategory.
