In brief:  If a structure has no nontrivial substructures, you can prove a
property P is true of everything in the structure by proving that the elements
with property P form a nonempty substructure.  Take the structure to be N with
the unary operation of successor and you get induction.  Now say that in the
opposite category:  If a structure has no nontrivial congruences, you can prove
that two objects are equal if they are equivalent under any congruence.  (You
can define "definition by coinduction" by a similar dualization.)  This has
found many applications in computer science (where the congruence is
bisimulation).  See J.J.M.M. Rutten, Universal coalgebra: a theory of systems.
