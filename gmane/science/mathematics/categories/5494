Dear categorists,

The question for me is not : small or large categories, but small or =20
large structures.

The Bourbaki's time was the time of small structures (groups, mono=C3=AFds, =
=20
rings, spaces, etc), the "categorical time" is the time of structures =20
of structures,i.e. large structures (groupoids, complete categories, =20
abelian cat=C3=A9gories, topos, etc.).
The bridge beetwen the firsts and the seconds is the Yoneda lemma, =20
that is to say the introduction of logic, thus of the only true evil =20
category : the category of sets. All the other large categorical =20
stuctures introduced by categorists are deduced from category Set, by =20
abstraction, generalisations, constructions or restrictions. In fact =20
"category theory" is an (wonderfull but) inappropriate name (here the =20
word category is only an important and historical keyword): the reason =20
is that a lot of data (limits, classifiant object, etc) appear as =20
properties because of their universal properties (unicity up to =20
isomorphism). But "category theory" is an illusion, nobody studies =20
seriouly the categorical structures (I don't know any structure =20
theorem on the categorical structures without additional properties).
That is my starting point of  reflexion on this subject.

I think there is a true theory of the small categories, but it is not =20
yet born, if it must ever exist. This theory should be, not only for =20
the 1-categories, but also for the n and omega-categories (strict or =20
not possibly). And, for me, the Yoneda lemma is an important tool (but =20
only a tool). Such a theory may be eventually important for the =20
computer science (particularly for the formal languages).

My best wishes for the new year,

Albert burroni
