Suppose the class I is described by a first-order formula a(x) and the
classes C_i are described by a first-order formula c(x,i), i.e:

I = {i | a(i)}
C_i = {x | c(x,i)}

Then the intersection of the C_i's is a class because it is described as

D = {x | forall i, a(i) => c(x,i)}

Your condition that the C_i's are contained in a class C is redundant
because we may always take C=V, the universe.

With kind regards,

Andrej
