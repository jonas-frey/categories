Dear Mr. Dole,

I am one of many who is (or will be) very grateful to you for these
beautiful notes. I have never seen them before. Do you know how accurate
they are? Had Mac Lane seen them?

While making a copy of them I read on your webpage:

"...Below are the lecture notes dating back to 1968. Interestingly, there=
=E2=80=99s
no space in =E2=80=9CMacLane=E2=80=9D...

As a comment to that here is what Mac Lane says in his book "A Mathematical
Autobiography" (Page 6):

"...The space in Mac Lane was added years later by me, when my first wife,
Dorothy, found it difficult to type our name without a space".

Best regards,
George Janelidze
