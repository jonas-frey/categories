I believe that in his paper "Notions of topos" Ross Street used the
name "V-moderate category" for this or a closely related notion.
There the point was that V-moderate categories have another advantage
over locally V-small ones, namely that their objects can (assuming the
axiom of choice) be well-ordered with all initial segments being
V-small.
