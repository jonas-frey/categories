Dear Ronnie,
I usually enjoy your remarks and I would probably have enjoyed your =20
last ones, except that I cannot read it. Has the sorry time finally =20
arrived when one can no longer work in Mathematics unless he knows =20
TeX, LaTeX, and/or other sophisticated word processings? Should I, =20
and many others it would be too long to name, stop doing mathematics?

I'd appreciate answers from all colleagues
