            15th International Workshop on
            Expressiveness in Concurrency
                     (EXPRESS'08)

          August 23rd, 2008, Toronto (Canada)
              Affiliated to CONCUR 2008


SCOPE AND TOPICS:

The EXPRESS workshops aim at bringing together researchers interested
in the relations between various formal systems, particularly in the
field of Concurrency. More specifically, they focus on the comparison
between programming concepts (such as concurrent, functional,
imperative, logic and object-oriented programming) and between
mathematical models of computation (such as process algebras, Petri
nets, event structures, modal logics, rewrite systems etc.) on the
basis of their relative expressive power.


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

Short papers (up to 5 pages, not included in the final proceedings)
and Full papers (up to 15 pages) are accepted only in ENTCS-style.
Paper submission is performed through the EXPRESS'08 EASYCHAIR server
(to be opened on May, 15th).

The very best papers will be invited in a special issue of the journal
of Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.


INVITED SPEAKERs:

Michele Bugliesi, Venezia (I), joint with SecCo'08;
Gianluigi Zavattaro, Bologna (I).


IMPORTANT DATES:

Abstract submission: June 1st, 2008
Paper submission: June 8th, 2008.
Notification date: July 4th, 2008
Submission of preliminary version for the Proceedings: July 14th, 2008
Submission of final version for ENTCS: September 29th, 2008.
