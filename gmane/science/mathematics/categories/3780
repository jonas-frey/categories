Dear Marta,

Congratulations on the success of your campaign to get Elsevier to
withdraw from the arms trade.  However, I do not understand what
use I am supposed to make of this news.

If you tell your child that s/he will not get any chocolate cake
until s/he tidies his/her bedroom, and then s/he does so, you are
obliged to provide the chocolate cake.

Are you now saying that Elsevier was just a naughty child, whom
we loved all along really, and that we should start "publishing"
(ie privatising) our papers in their expensive journals?

It seems to me that the discussion on this list on this issue around
Christmas completely failed to address the main point of the journals
issue. Well, it nearly got there, but it was at just that point that
Bob cut it off.

The problem lies with the academic establishment, starting from
professors like you who are editors of journals, organisers of
conferences or heads of department, through the managements of
universities, up to the ministers of education in our respective
countries.  These are the people who hold the guns to our heads
while companies like Elsevier rob us of our intellectual property.

If certain of my colleagues want to set up new open-access on-line
journals in topology or whatever subject, then I strongly welcome
that, and am willing to help if they ask me to do so.

However, this does not solve the problem of the pressure that is
put on us by our lords and masters, especially when they specify
lists of "approved" journals, or employ - inherently fraudulent -
methods of bibliometry to "assess" our work.

Best wishes,
Paul
