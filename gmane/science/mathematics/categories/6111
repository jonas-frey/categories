George Janelidze just wrote to tell me that the definition of equivalence
of categories is wrong.  Yes, and it is wrong in the original too.  The
corrected version, with a new footnote is in the latest version, just
posted.  George further requested that I maintain a list of errata so if
you find an error you can refer to that list before sending it to me.
Instead, since I will post a new version whenever I get and correct an
error, please just check your errors against the latest version.

I don't know how many times, I read G's definition of categorical
equivalence, not realzing that it was insufficient.
