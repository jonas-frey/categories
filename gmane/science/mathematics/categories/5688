In general, discussion threads about mathematical priority have been
allowed on the categories list. They have sometimes continued longer than
was warranted.

As some of you are aware, there has been correspondence sent to a private
mailing list during the past two weeks concerning, among other things,
Jean Benabou's assertion that he has not been adequately credited for some
of his mathematical work. That correspondence is not forwarded to the
categories list.

Peter Freyd has sent a message to the categories list which contains his
recollection of two conferences in the 1960's. His message touches on the
assertion noted in the previous paragraph, and which is also in a message
from Jean Benabou forwarded to the categories list on March 28. Peter's
message will be posted shortly.

To be fair to those who were present at those meetings, but also to ensure
concise follow-up, the following procedure is in effect:

Anyone who was present at either of the meetings referred to in Peter's
message may send *one posting* only in response to the categories mailing
list. A response must be confined to the topic. Messages which respect
these requirements, *and* the usual list guidelines, will be forwarded to
the mailing list. Any other message in response will not be sent.

This restrictive procedure will not be used often, but it will be
enforced. It is acknowledged in advance that some will disagree. With
respect, that disagreement is not a topic for discussion on the categories
mailing list.

It is disheartening to impose limitation of discussion on the list.
However, I am determined that the quality of our forum will not be
degraded by harassment of subscribers or the moderator.

Finally, this message provides an opportunity to express appreciation to
the many who have privately offered support for decisions taken for this
mailing list. We can hope that the list will continue for at least another
twenty years, and that you will not be subjected to more long messages
from me.

best wishes,
Bob Rosebrugh
