Enrico Vitale just sent me the answer for that one:  C = the 2-category
of idempotent-closed categories, D = the 2-category of presheaf
categories.  This categorifies C = Pos, D = StoneDLat by passing from 2
to Set as the enriching autonomous category (so in that sense one could
say we were in 3-CAT all along, though presumably only trivially so by
virtue of only having identity modifications when V = 2, I think).

Although I'd heard the phrase "Morita equivalence" many times over the
years, it meant nothing to me until recently when Bill Lawvere was
talking about graphs as presheaves on the monoid consisting of the three
monotone functions on the ordinal 2 and I finally woke up to the
connection between splitting the two idempotents and ME (the
equivalence, not the condition).  The idempotent closure of that monoid,
meaning the result of splitting the idempotents, is just the initial
segment of Delta of length 2, aka the ordinals 1 and 2 and their
monotone functions.  The impact on the models, here graphs, is that
splitting the idempotents results in giving the self-loops that were
playing the role of vertices their own datatype V, as coded by the
ordinal 1.  This new category of graphs is not the old one as its
objects now have vertices in their own right, but it is equivalent to
the old one.  {2} and {1,2}, each made a category with respectively 3
and 7 monotone functions, are Morita equivalent: they have equivalent
idempotent closures, and homming into Set maps them to equivalent
categories, the iff that makes Morita equivalence important.

ME is the kernel of idempotent closure, which is a categorification,
with Set in place of 2, of the functor Ord --> Pos (Ord the category of
preordered sets, Pos of posets) that collapses the cliques.  The reason
there is no representable duality between Ord and a suitable cousin of
StoneDLat (FinOrd and FinDLat for the Stonaphobes) is that preorders are
equivalent to posets and the Yoneda embedding taking elements of P to
primes in 2^P, while fully faithful, is only good up to equivalence.
(The homfunctor being transposed here is the order <= : P\op x P --> 2.)

The categorification of this, meaning in this case not the passage from
2-CAT to 3-CAT but from enrichment in 2 to enrichment in Set, still has
to deal with equivalence in the same way (though here it goes with the
territory and so is less noticeable than back down at Ord vs. Pos where
we tend to think isomorphism rather than equivalence).  But Hom: C\op x
C --> Set is not itself an equivalence but only a "retract that retracts
retracts", the essence of Morita equivalence (a dual of Freyd's "trivial
for a trivial reason"?).  In order to take the "log to the base Set" we
can't really "retract all the retracts" because we may need to keep some
of them around but then which ones (like picking a dense subset of a
continuum: which subset?).  We can however put them all in, which is to
say, split all the idempotents, so we do that in order to get a normal form.

The rest of this duality is then the triviality that the internal hom of
CAT is contravariant in its first argument.  Morita equivalence is the
only thing to be worried about.

Proposition 5.28 of Kelly's "Basic Concepts of Enriched Category
Theory", namely that Cauchy completion (Kelly's name for the enriched
counterpart of idempotent closure) permits taking logs to any autonomous
base V, then produces a proper class of dualities, one for every
autonomous V.  In particular we can recover Pos\op ~ StoneDLat by taking
V = 2.  (Pos and Ord, preordered sets, while not equivalent any more
than CAT and its subcategory of idempotent-closed categories are
equivalent, have equivalent objects which is all we need ask of a
duality.)  There are two "good" 3-object V's, the non-Heyting one of
which enriches the "prossets" that Haim Gaifman and I wrote about in
LICS'87, so these have their dual objects in the same way, by homming
into 3, a construct I talked about incomprehensibly at the Newton
Institute meeting on geometry in computation some years ago, not
recognizing that it was a duality.  Metric spaces, another duality
there.  And so on.

But then every such duality has its subdualities, for example Set\op ~
CABA as a subduality of Pos\op ~ StoneDLat, so a great many more
dualities there.

Enrico also mentioned the Gabriel-Ulmer duality for locally finitely
presentable categories, and the Adamek-Lawvere-Rosicky duality for
varieties.  Are these in addition to the above or can they be recovered
from them?  Likewise for the duality Peter Johnstone mentioned?
