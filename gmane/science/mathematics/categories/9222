The ???Cahiers???have been created by Charles Ehresmann in 1957/58. We have
decided to make an important change on their 60th birthday: from January
2018 on, the ???Cahiers??? will become a free (and no-fee) Open Access
Journal (no longer paper-printed), while keeping their present
objectives and presentation (except for paper being replaced by e-file).
Indeed, the volume of each year will still consist of 4 quarterly issues
(about 80-100 pages each), in the same format as the present Cahiers
except that they will be pdf files rather than paper-books.

At the beginning of each quarter, the (entire) corresponding issue will
be posted on the site

http://ehres.pagesperso-orange.fr/Cahiers/Ctgdc.htm

and will be freely downloadable. The people who ask for it will be
informed when an issue is published online and downloadable. And the
separate articles will also be freely downloadable from the
Louvain-la-Neuve mirror site (which is almost ready, and will be
functional soon). There will still be no charge for authors nor their
institution.
We hope this change toward more modernity and easier access will allow
for more permanency of the ???Cahiers???, and an increased visibility.

Andree Ehresmann, Marino Gran and Rene Guitart
