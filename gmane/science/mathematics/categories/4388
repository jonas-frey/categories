Consider the dual finitary question: In universal algebra in order to show
that finitely presented objects  are closed under coequalizers it is
essential  that a amorphism of finitely presented objects lift to a
morphism  between the free. Is this the only way to prove it ? :

" but when I look at examples, it has turned out to be true
 for other reasons."
