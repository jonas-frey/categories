******************************************************************
PhD Position
Applications of Category Theory to Computer Science
Mathematically Structured Programming Group
University of Strathclyde
******************************************************************

Applications are invited for PhD study under the supervision of Prof
Neil Ghani in an application of category theory to computer
science. The applicant must hold either a first class UK degree (or
equivalent) in their first degree or a distinction (or equivalent) at
masters level. The applicant's motivation must centre on a desire for
beautiful mathematics of lasting value.

The candidate will be part of the Mathematically Structured
Programming Group whose vision is to use mathematics to understand the
nature of computation, and to then turn that understanding into the
next generation of programming languages. This reflects the symbiotic
relationship between mathematics, programming, and the design of
programming languages --- any attempt to sever this connection will
diminish each component. In order to achieve these research goals we
mainly use ideas from category theory, type theory and functional
programming. Besides Professor Neil Ghani, the group consists of a
number of internationally leading researchers including Dr Patricia
Johann, Dr Conor McBride, Dr Peter Hancock and Dr Robert Atkey as well
as a number of PhD students.

Anyone interested should in the first instance contact Professor Neil
Ghani at ng@cis.strath.ac.uk and outline their academic
background. Funding is expected to come from the SICSA PhD program.
