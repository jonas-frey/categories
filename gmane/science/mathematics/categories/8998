Dear Steve, Clemens and Andre,

Grothendieck did not come up with the notion of an elementary topos - Lawve=
re and Tierney did, so much so that he informally referred to the subobject=
s classifier as "the Lawvere object", as Clemens observes. Nevertheless, an=
d referring to a remark by Steve, the basic idea of Grothendieck of a categ=
ory of sheaves on a site is indeed captured by the more general (and certai=
nly less controversial) notion of an S-bounded elementary topos, where S is=
  an arbitrary elementary topos with an NNO.

As for the word "topos", I believe that, in view of its many uses and regar=
dless of the meaning "space", it ought to be specified in any context where=
  one uses it.  I find this way of proceeding preferable to identifying it w=
ith "Grothendieck topos" as Andre suggests. In addition, I see no reason to=
  use "logical" instead of "elementary" since the latter is already in use a=
nd means "first-order".

Best regards,
Marta

Dear Steve,


Thank you for your interesting comments. Grothendieck did not come up with =
the notion of an elementary topos - Lawvere and Tierney did, so much so tha=
t he informally referred to the subobjects classifier as "the Lawvere objec=
t". Nevertheless, the basic idea of Grothendieck of a category of sheaves o=
n a site is indeed captured by the more general (and certainly less controv=
ersial) notion of an S-bounded elementary topos, where S is an arbitrary el=
ementary topos with an NNO. I think that this is what you had in mind. As f=
or the word "topos", I believe that it ought to be specified in any context=
  where one uses it.  I find this way of proceeding preferable to identifyin=
g it with "Grothendieck topos" as Joyal suggests.


Best regards,

Marta
