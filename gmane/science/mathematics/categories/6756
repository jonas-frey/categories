dear Marta,

I apologise, I had forgoten our conversation!
My memory was never good, and it is getting worst.

I disagree with your conclusion. I looked at your paper with Hermida.
We are not talking about the same model structure. The fibrations in =20
2Cat(S) defined
by Steve Lack (your definition 7.1) are too weak when the topos S does =20=

not satify the axiom of choice.
Equivalently, his generating set of trivial cofibrations is too small.

Nobody has read my paper with Myles
<A.Joyal, M.Tierney: Classifying spaces for sheaves of simplicial =20
groupoids, JPAA, Vol 89, 1993>.

Best,
Andr=E9

Dear Andre,
You were indeed aware of my work and that with Pare on stacks since =20
you are one of the few we thank for useful conversations! There were =20
two ways to define stacks and one of them was your suggestion. One =20
could say that one is expressed directly in terms of descent and the =20
other in terms of weak equivalences. As it turns out, both are needed =20=

in my construction of the stack completion and similarly in the 2-=20
dimensional case.
As for which method is preferable, I do not know. Whether one =20
constructs stack completions for categories in a Grothendieck topos =20
using the carving out from presheaf toposes (my method), or by means =20
of a model structure (yours), one has to resort to the existence of a =20=

generating family to keep them small.
No, I am not thinking of the analogue of Steve Lack's model structure =20=

since, strictly speaking, it has nothing to do with stacks. Comments =20
to that effect (with which Steve agrees) are included in the Bunge-=20
Hermida paper. It was actually a surprise to discover that after =20
trying to do what you suggest and failing. I attach my paper with =20
Hermida in this connection. Section 3 makes clear what happens with =20
Lack's model structure in dimension 1, and Section 7 considers the 2-=20
dimensional analogue, also not suitable to get the 2-stack completion.
I really meant an extension of the Joyal-Tierney model structure. =20
Thanks for pointing out Moerdijk's work, and your old one with =20
Tierney. I will eventually look into those.
No need to respond to this.
Best regards, and many thanks,Marta

this, I have a question for you. Is there a model structure on 2-=20
Cat(S) (or 2-Gerbes(S)), for S a Grothedieck topos, >whose weak =20
equivalences are the weak 2-equivalence 2-functors, and whose fibrant =20=
