                   5th International Conference on Logic
                   Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning

                                  LPNMR'99
                                      
                 El Paso, Texas USA, September 22--25, 1999

   LPNMR'99 is the fifth in the series of internatinal meetings on logic
   programming and nonmonotonic reasoning. Four previous meetings were
   held in Washington, U.S.A., in 1991, in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1993, in
   Lexington, U.S.A., in 1995, and in Dagstuhl, Germany, in 1997.
   
   The proceedings of LPNMR'99 will be published by Springer in the
   LNCS/LNAI series (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/).
   
Aim and Scope

   The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between
   researchers interested in the design and implementation of logic based
   programming languages and database systems and researchers who work in
   the areas of knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning.
   
   A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest include:

    1. Development and mathematical investigation of logical systems with
       non-monotonic entailment relations. This includes (but is not
       limited to)
         1. Extensions of ``classical'' LPNMR languages by new logical
            connectives and new inference capabilities such as abduction,
            reasoning by cases, etc;
         2. Semantics of new and existing languages;
         3. Relationship between various formalisms;
         4. Complexity and expressive power;
         5. Development and implementation of inference mechanisms for
            LPNMR systems;
         6. Updates and other operations on LPNMR systems;
         7. LPNMR systems with uncertainty.

    2. Applications of LPNMR systems.
         1. Methodology of representing knowledge in LPNMR languages.
            Theory and practice;
         2. LPNMR languages and algorithms in planning, diagnoses,
            software engineering, and other domains;
         3. Implemented LPNMR systems: Descriptions, Comparisons,
            Evaluations and Benchmarks.
       
Submission of Papers

   Papers must not exceed twelve (12) pages including references and
   figures, with a maximum of 38 lines per page and an average of 75
   characters per line (corresponding to the LaTeX article style, 12 pt).
   Further information is available on the Springer website at
   http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.
   
   Papers must be written in English and include a cover page containing:
   title, abstract, keywords, postal and email addresses of all authors,
   voice and fax number of the contact author.
   
   Papers should be submitted in five copies to either of the Programme
   Co-chairs. Electronic submission should be sent in (compressed
   uuencoded) postscript to LPNMR99@dbai.tuwien.ac.at. Both electronic
   and postal submission must be received by April 6, 1999; by the same
   date, the authors must also send a text-only version of the cover page
   to LPNMR99@dbai.tuwien.ac.at.
   
   Accepted papers must be presented at the conference.
