I think what you want here is the following observation.
Every closed monoidal V-category E is also an E-category.
The unit object j for tensor in E  is a monoid and so E(j,-) : E --> V
is a monoidal V-functor. Therefore by applying it on hom objects,
it induces a 2-functor E-Cat --> V-Cat. In particular, you can apply
the 2-functor to E itself to see it as a V-category.

Your example is for E =3D [C,V].

PS I have ordinary- (not enriched-) mailed your message to Brian himself.
He may want to add something when he gets it. But I hope I have the story
you need!
