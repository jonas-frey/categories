Abd-Allah and I dealt with this in

 ``A compact-open topology on partial maps with open domain'', {\em J. London
Math Soc.} (2) 21 (1980) 480-486.

as a development of work with Peter Booth in

 ``Spaces of partial maps, fibred mapping spaces and the compact-open
topology'', {\em Gen. Top. Appl.} 8 (1978) 181-195.

We got the idea of representability of partial maps from Peter Freyd's
article on topos theory. Is there an earlier result on these lines?

Ideas on making spaces over B into a Cartesian closed category came initially
from a paper of Rene Thom, and were developed in Peter's work at Hull.  This
eventually suggested the topologisation of spaces of partial maps as a step
towards Top/B.
