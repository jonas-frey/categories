     Mathematicians and computer scientists who have developed
a clear vision of the relation between lambda calculus
and cartesian-closed categories, as Jonathan Burns evidently
has, may wish to consider the following PROBLEM:

     1.  There is a great deal of technical development of
the presentational machinery of lambda calculus.

     2.  Lately, there have been interesting advances in the
study of the algebraic theory of exponential rigs, which
Tarski called "the high school" theory. (See papers of
Stanley Burris et al. on counter examples by Wilkie et al.
to naive completeness conjectures.)
    
     3.  There are many objectively (or semantically)
arising examples of cartesian-closed categories in the form
of presheaf toposes, such as that of finite directed graphs
or of discrete dynamical systems (as explained in our recent
elementary book published by Cambridge).

     4.  The rich variety of models mentioned in 3. has apparently
NEVER BEEN DIRECTLY RELATED to the abstract theory of lambda
calculus, nor to the theory of exponential rigs.  In the latter
case, although specific models are of great interest, they
have been constructed by formal syntactical means, rather than
through the "objective number theory" means via Steiner-Cantor-
Burnside-Grothendieck-Schanuel abstraction from these concrete
categories of combinatorial structures, in which the exponent-
iation operation has a very explicit mathematical content and 
construction. Although the exponential rigs capture only
the "existence of isomorphisms" equations between objects
as opposed to the detailed knowledge of given morphisms
(usually not iso) between the combinatorial structures and
the detailed particular operations that lambda calculus 
eventually wants to apply to, nonetheless already at that
level nontrivial equational questions arise.  For example,
there are often "connected" objects A which satisfy equations
B^A + C^A = (B+C)^A, and there are sometimes sufficiently
separating "figures" or "elements" of connected shapes.
As another example, exponential objects occasionally are
actually polynomial in the sense that B^A is actually iso-
morphic to F(A,B) where F is a combination of products and
co-products;  two cases that I know of are, with B = A,
F = 2A^2 and F = 1+A.  The latter has a clear intuitive
interpretation that the only internally definable endomaps
are either identity or constant.  But it is an open PROBLEM
whether there are any other polynomials  F  for which there
exists a finite presheaf topos, in which there exist objects
A enjoying such isomorphisms.
