1) I'm not sure what Mike means by `those monads that correspond to toposes'
since most toposes don't correspond to monads on anything. I did investigate
those toposes which are monadic over Set, or a power of Set, in my papers
`When is a variety a topos?', Algebra Universalis 21 (1985), 198--212, and
`Collapsed toposes and cartesian closed varieties', J. Algebra 129 (1990),
446--480.

2) A possible answer to this question is that the (2-)category of finitely
presented minimal toposes (and logical functors) is equivalent to the dual
of the free topos (on no generators), where a topos is said to be minimal
if it has no proper full logical subtoposes. This is a result of Peter
Freyd, but I don't know whether he ever published it.
