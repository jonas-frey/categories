Dear All,

Can I ask why Loday's cat^n groups are not mentioned? (They have been
now.)  I know they are not globular, but by spreading out the `weakness' of
the higher groupoid structures the axioms end up being strict (and very
simple as they are really just abstractions of classical commutator
identities).  Surely they deserve to be used as a reference point to
compare some of the other candidates. Loday's models work for *all *n-types
for finite n. (I do not know how to handle general homotopy types using any
similar methodology.)
