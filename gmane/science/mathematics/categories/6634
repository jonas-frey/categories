My private reply to the original query from Jean-Pierre Marquis pointed
to the style of combinatorial proof you refer to:  they are called =
"bijective" or
"combinatorial"  proofs depending on the author, and rely on giving
interpretations of "big ugly formula_1" and "big ugly formula_2" as =
enumerating
the same thing by different means.

For instance on can prove that

n*2^{n-1} =3D \sum_{k=3D1}^n k*C(n,k)

(writing C(n,k) for the binomial coefficient "n chose k") by =
differentiating the
binomial theorem and evaluating at 1, but this hardly seems to explain =
it.

Better is to observe that both sides count the number of ways to select =
a=20
subset with a distinguished element from an n element set, the LHS by
selecting the distinguished element, then the rest of the subset, the =
RHS
by choosing a cardinality k for the subset, selecting the subset then =
selecting
the distinguished element from the subset.
