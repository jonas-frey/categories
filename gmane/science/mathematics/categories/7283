Dear categorists,

and also, hello everyone, since this is my first post here! I'm wondering a=
bout the connection of Bourbaki to category theory. The copy of "Theory of =
Sets" that I have says it's written in 1970. Yet, Dieudonn=E9 famously saii=
d that the theory of functors subsumed Bourbaki's theory of structures... a=
nd, also, Bourbaki's theory of structures is very clearly a theory of a typ=
e of concrete categories. On the other hand, I've seen claims that the cate=
gorists' use of "morphism" comes from Bourbaki. So who was first? Does anyo=
ne here know when Bourbaki's theory of structures was really conceived? I g=
uess this might be self-evident to anyone born during the 1st half of the 2=
0th century, but it has turned out to be really hard to find out for me.

Thanks in advance,
staffan=
