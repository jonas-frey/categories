One point that no-one has mentioned yet is that you can't have
exponentiation and its dual in the same category, unless it is a
preorder. If exponentiation exists, then the initial object 0 is
strict, and so 0 x 0 = 0 (read all equality signs as isomorphisms).
But if A + (-) has a left adjoint then it distributes over product,
so
A = A + 0 = A + (0 x 0) = (A + 0) x (A + 0) = A x A
which implies that any two maps into A (with the same domain)
are equal. Of course, bi-Heyting algebras (posets P such that
both P and P^op are cartesian closed) are of some interest, as has
already been mentioned; but if you want to work in non-preordered
categories then you have to choose one or the other.
