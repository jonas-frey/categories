                                Call for Papers

                       The 15th International Workshop on
                 Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science (CMCS'20)
                     Dublin, Ireland, 25 - 26 April 2020
                           (co-located with ETAPS 2020)
                               www.coalg.org/cmcs20


Objectives and scope
--------------------
Established in 1998, the CMCS workshops aim to bring together
researchers with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras, their
logics, and their applications. As the workshop series strives to
maintain breadth in its scope, areas of interest include neighbouring
fields as well.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
   approaches);
- coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
   languages, dynamical systems, term rewriting, etc.);
- coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent,
   and constraint) programming;
- coalgebraic data types, type systems and behavioural typing;
- coinductive definition and proof principles for coalgebras (including
   "up-to" techniques);
- coalgebras and algebras;
- coalgebras and (modal) logic;
- coalgebraic specification and verification;
- coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and
   hybrid systems);
- coalgebra in quantum computing;
- coalgebra and game theory;
- tools exploiting coalgebraic techniques.

Submission guidelines
---------------------
We solicit two types of contributions: regular papers and short
contributions. Regular papers must be original, unpublished, and not
submitted for publication elsewhere. They should not exceed 20 pages
in length in Springer LNCS style. Short contributions may describe work
in progress, or summarise work submitted to a conference or workshop
elsewhere. They should be no more than two pages. Regular papers and
short contributions should be submitted electronically as a PDF file
via the Easychair system at

          http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcmcs2020.

The proceedings of CMCS 2020 will include all accepted regular papers
and will be published post-conference as a Springer volume in the
IFIP-LNCS series. Accepted short contributions will be bundled in a
technical report.
