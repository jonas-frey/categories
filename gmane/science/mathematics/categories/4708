Dear Colleagues,

I think John asks a very good question! However:

While the Thomson Scientific's "Science Citation Index" could be related to
some commercial matters that I do not understand, Mathematical Reviews in
just Mathematical Reviews,

and for each of us it has "Author Profile",

and among other things it gives you the total number of citations on your
papers,

and if you click on "Citations", it lists citations,

and below the list there is "Reference List Journals",

and if you click on that, you will see a lot of journal titles,

but not "Theory and Applications of Categories", not "Cahiers", and not
"Applied Categorical Structures".

That is, according to Mathematical Reviews, the citations in Category Theory
journals are not citations!

I am sure this is not what Mathematical Reviews really wanted to do, and
that it must be corrected first of all.

George Janelidze
