Tutorial Abstracts

Samson Abramsky:
Game Semantics for Programming Languages

Abstract
  These  lectures  will give   an introduction  to   game semantics and its
applications   to  modelling   programming   languages.  The   mathematical
structure of categories  of games will be described,  and it  will be shown
how  they can be   used to model a  range   of computational features in  a
precise way.


E. Allen Emerson:
Games, mu-calculus, and Program Verification

Abstract
  Temporal logics are  often used to  verify concurrent programs using such
techniques as model checking. We describe some intimate connections between
such temporal logics, the related fixpoint logic  known as the mu-calculus,
and infinite games.  Applications include improved nonemptiness  algorithms
for  tree automata, mu-calculus  characterizations of winning strategies in
memoryless    games,  and an   automata-theoretic   characterization of the
complexity of model checking in the mu-calculus.


Wolfgang Thomas, Igor Walukiewicz:
Determinacy, the Rabin Tree Theorem and its Extensions

Abstract
  We present a  self-contained proof of  Rabin's Tree Theorem (decidability
of the monadic  theory  of   two successors).  The  proof  uses  memoryless
determinacy of infinite games. We also show some  extensions of the theorem
to  tree-like infinite  graphs  and  discuss  connections with fixed  point
calculi.

Social Program
==============

Get-together:

Get-together parties will  be held on Friday,  August 22 and Sunday, August
24,  7:00-10:00 pm at  the conference venue.  Beer and  soft drinks will be
served.


Excursion:

             Wednesday, August 27, 1997

Programme
  13:30 Departure from  the conference site  to the Museum of Prehistory at
Moesgaard, a culture-historical  museum  which specializes  in  prehistoric
archaeology and ethnography.

The collections are from the Danish prehistory ranging from the Paleolithic
Age to the end of  the Viking Age.   One  of the  major attractions is  the
Grauballe man  - the only completely preserved  bog body  from the Iron Age
(1st  century  BC).  An  ethnographical  special  exhibition about mountain
people   of the Hindu Kush  is  also on show at  Moesgaard.   On the museum
grounds a replica of  a stave church from  the Viking Age is  being erected
this  summer.  The building  is 9.5 m  long  and almost 5 m  wide  and is a
reconstruction of a church found during excavation  in Hoerning Church near
Randers.  The church is built to the north of the  Hedeby house just behind
the museum. Not since  the Viking Age   has a stave   church been built  in
Denmark. The public is invited to follow the reconstruction.

Weather  permitting,  we will take  a  prehistoric walk through  fields and
woods  passing  reconstructions of  Iron  Age houses,  places  of cult, and
dolmens from the Stone Age.  Refreshments will be served on the beach.

16:00 Buses will return to the centre of Aarhus,  more precisely to The Old
Town, an  open-air museum with  more than 75 half-timbered  houses, rebuilt
along cobbled streets and fitted out with all the workshops and furnishings
of  a Danish market  town, reflecting  life from 1600   down to our  grand-
parents' time.

A  meal  in the  Old Town  restaurant, Simonsen's  Garden,  will finish the
excursion.


Conference Dinner:

The conference dinner will be held  on the evening  of Thursday, August 28,
starting at 7 pm in the canteen at the conference venue.
