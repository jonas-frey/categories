Dear Steve,

your answer has been very useful to me.

Thus, for a closed complete category V, there are two related doctrines:

1) the V-categories [X,V], indexed by V-Cat;

2) the V-categories V_0^X, indexed by Cat.=20

The former is "included" in the latter via the forgetful functor=20
V-Cat -> Cat, and the latter has more structure since it is also an indexed=
  monoidal category.

I would like to know if the second doctrine, and its relationships with the=
  first one, had been considered explicitly somewhere (perhaps in some paper=
  by Brian Day?).

Thank you again

Claudio

=A0=20
