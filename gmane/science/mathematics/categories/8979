Dear all,

The University of Edinburgh is advertising two Lectureships, or
exceptionally Readerships, in "algebra, geometry & topology and related
fields such as category theory and mathematical physics":

https://www.vacancies.ed.ac.uk/pls/corehrrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=037664

There's another version of the ad here, on the website of the alg/geom/top
group (the "Hodge Institute"):

http://hodge.maths.ed.ac.uk/tiki/Positions

These positions are for practical purposes permanent, i.e. as close as the
UK gets to tenure. There?s no one-to-one correspondence between UK and US
job titles, but Lecturer is the usual starting position for someone in
their first permanent job, followed by Senior Lecturer, Reader, then
Professor.

We?re a happy, well-resourced department with a very positive atmosphere
and a strong research record.  (Usually we're rated 5th in the UK, after
Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial and Warwick.)  The algebra/geometry/topology
group provides an excellent home for a category theorist.

Best wishes,
Tom
