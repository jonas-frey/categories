It seems to me that what Venkata Rayudu Posina <posinavrayudu@gmail.com>
describes as a "deviation [with =91do not=92] from rule", viz.,

> ... do not draw more than one arrow from any dot in the domain ...

need not be seen in such a negative light, but can be seen in the more
positive light:

> all arrows from a given dot in the domain should be completely identica=
l.

I'm just reformulating the approach that "geometric logic" suggests --
not "there shall be no two different ... " but "any two ... shall be one.=
"

Oh, wait: do you think that is saying one wants 2 =3D 1 ? No, no, far fro=
m it.
What I am proposing, in too much of a hurry to have been clear enough, is=
:

: Given a dot d in the domain and a pair (u, v) of (not necessarily =

: distinct) arrows u and v from d, one may reasonably required that
: "those two are but one", i.e., that u =3D v .

I hope that helps, Posina :-) . Cheers, -- Fred
