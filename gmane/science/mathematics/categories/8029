Dear Uwe,

Of course, Rel is self-dual, as you already remarked.=20

Consider a relation R from A to B, i.e., a subset of A x B.
Define the image-function img(R) from the powerset P(A) to the powerset
P(B) by mapping a subset U of A to the union of all subsets of B of the
form aR with a in U (where aR consists of all elements in B R-related to
a).  Then R is a monomorphism in Rel iff img(R) is injective, which in
particular implies that R is total.=20

Dually, R is an epimorphism in Rel iff img(R^op) is injective, in
particular R^op then is total.

Moreover, disjoint unions serve as both coproducts and products in Rel,
but (co)equalizers in general fail to exist.=20

Best regards,

-- J=FCrgen Koslowski
