Dear Colleagues

The Macquarie University Mathematics Department is advertising for a
continuing appointment at the Senior Lecturer level (Level C). Please
see Job Reference 22083 on the Human Resources page:
http://macquarieuniversity.nga.net.au/bin/fnt_jobs_list.cfm?mode=def
Some details are copied below. A research record in category theory is
essential.

It is also highly probable that one or two fixed-term jobs (Lecturer
Level - - called Level B) will be advertised soon. These will not
specifically be for category theory but will require early
availability and teaching experience (probably with preference going
to people familiar with our kinds of courses).

Please notify suitable candidates. I am happy to answer enquiries.

Ross Street
