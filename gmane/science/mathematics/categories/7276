Greetings to all!

This is the second announcement for the fifth workshop=20
"R=E9alisabilit=E9 =E0 Chamb=E9ry".

This year's workshop will take place from Tuesday the 5th of June to=20
Friday the 8th of June.

The invited speakers are:
     - Martin Hofmann (Munich): "Proof-relevant logical relations",
     - Jonas Frey (Paris): "Basic relational objects as an algebraic=20
       framework for realizability"
     - Jean-Louis Krivine (Paris): classical realizability, TBA,
     - Alexandre Miquel (Lyon): realizability model for set theory, TBA.

The program will be made available shortly here:
     http://lama.univ-savoie.fr/~hyvernat/Realisabilite2012/program.php

Note that the meeting will start on Tuesday the 5th, at 2'00 pm.



Partial information is gathered on the web page:
      http://lama.univ-savoie.fr/~hyvernat/Realisabilite2012/
and you can (should) register for the workshop there:
      http://lama.univ-savoie.fr/~hyvernat/Realisabilite2012/registration.=
php



There will be sessions for contributed talks, and PhD students are=20
particularly encouraged to submit a talk. (There are very few=20
submissions at this time: don't hesitate to submit something...)



For the first time, we will offer a couple of grants for students=20
attending the workshop. Those grants will cover (part of) the cost=20
of the travel and a room on the campus. We still don't know how many=20
grants we will be able to award, but priority will be given to=20
students presenting their work at the workshop.
If you are interested, register and contact me as soon as possible...


It is possible to get a student room (on campus, very cheap, but=20
only a bare room). Students will of course be given priority for=20
those, but anyone may ask... You do have to register before the 25th=20
of May though.


Other possibilities for accommodation are given on the web page:
      http://lama.univ-savoie.fr/~hyvernat/Realisabilite2012/logistic.php
