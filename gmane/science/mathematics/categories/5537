Here, it's important to distinguish graph and category. A (small)
category is a graph in some sense, but not all graphs are necessarily
categories. For instance, a category must have a composition operation
E x E -> E that is closed on edges.

As far as the poset-embedding example goes, Todd Trimble has an
excellent article on the topic:

Maybe this will clarify.
