The other Peter J cites half of a theorem that appears on page 20,
section 1.364, of Cats & Alligators. A "strong equivalence" was
defined to be the usual notion: an isomorphism in the
category-of-categories-and-natural-equivalence-classes-of-functors.
The binary relation of "equivalent categories" can be taken just as
the equivalence relation generated by the condition that there be a
full embedding with a replete image. ("Full embedding" means only
that the induced maps on hom-sets are isomorphisms.) If  S  is a
skeletal category then it is a "skeleton of A" if appears as a full
replete subcategory of  A. It is "co-skeleton of A" iff there is an
onto full embedding  A --> S.

Then:

Each of the following is equivalent to the axiom of choice:

  (a) Equivalent categories are strongly equivalent.
  (b) Every category has a skeleton.
  (c) Every category has a co-skeleton.
  (d) Any two skeletons of a category are isomorphic.
  (e) Any two co-skeletons of a category are isomorphic.

For convenience we add:

  (f) Given a non-empty family  {S_i}_I  of equinumerous sets
      there exists  0  in  I  and a family of isomorphisms of the
      permutation groups  {Aut(S_0) --> Aut(S_i)}_I.
  (g) Given a family  (S_i}_I  of non-empty equinumerous sets,
      there exists a family  (x_i}_I  such that  x_i  in  S_i
      for all  i in I.

[I've moved the string "non-empty" in (g) to its right place.]

The first time I ever thought to write this down was in 1980 at a
blackboard in one of those bomb-shelter-style classrooms in the old
math building at Cambridge.
