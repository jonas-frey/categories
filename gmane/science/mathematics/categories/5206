that covers all fields of mathematics as well as (theoretical)
computer science, has opened its 2010 programs, including
an attractive research chair and a (1 year or 2 years) postdoc programme.
Applications that are particularly suited for one of the two research lab=
s

with a member of the hosting laboratory or team. Only candidates with a
clear research fit, and a high research profile may have a chance to win
this tough competition, given its broad scope!
Don't hesitate to contact me or one of my colleages in Paris 7
University for further details or advice.

Best regards,

Pierre-Louis
