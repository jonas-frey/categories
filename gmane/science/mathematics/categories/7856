Perhaps this is not really what you want, though.  What I would like to
know, related to this, is can there be a non-trivial category internally
fibred over itself?

This question, like your question, leaves some room to ask just what it
means.

If we just try to Grothendieck-fiber this category of all categories in NF
over itself we meet type problems.  A type-level notion of pair will not
let us form the set of all pairs of a category and an object in it.  Maybe
a routine NF trick gets around this, maybe not.  I wanted to share this
thought, and clarify it for myself, before plunging into the world of NF
tricks.

best, Colin
