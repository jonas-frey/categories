New:  Electronic Submission Guidelines
      Revised list of Invited Speakers

**********************************************************************

IARCS, the Indian Association for Research in Computing Science,
announces the 20th Annual FST TCS Conference in New Delhi.
Tentatively planned satellite events include include two workshops: on
Computational Geometry and on Advances in Programming Languages.

Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and
unpublished research on **any** theoretical aspects of Computer
Science. Papers in applied areas with a strong foundational emphasis
are also welcome.  The proceedings of the last six years' conferences
(Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science volumes 880, 1026,
1180, 1346, 1530, 1738) give an idea of the kind of papers typically
presented at FST TCS.  Typical areas include (but are not restricted to):

         Automata, Languages and Computability 
         Randomized and Approximation Algorithms 
         Computational Geometry
         Computational Biology
         Combinatorial Optimization
         Graph and Network Algorithms 
         Complexity Theory 
         Parallel and Distributed Computing 
         New Models of Computation
         Concurrent, Real-time and Hybrid Systems 
         Logics of Programs and Modal Logics
         Database Theory  and Information Retrieval
         Automated Reasoning, Rewrite Systems, and Applications 
         Logic, Proof Theory, Model Theory and Applications
         Semantics of Programming Languages
         Static Analysis and  Type Systems
         Theory of Functional and Constraint-based Programming 
         Software Specification and Verification 
         Cryptography and Security Protocols


For an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, one of 
the authors must commit to presenting the paper at the conference.
