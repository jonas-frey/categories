I thought people knew how to add before they knew how to take limits.  :-)

Hmm.  How do you propose to show there *exists* an algebraically closed
subfield of the complex numbers?  I would do it using the fundamental
theorem of algebra - the usual one, for the complex numbers.  Unless
you have some other way, I don't understand how you hope to circumvent
the use of analysis by introducing such an entity.

Indeed, the usual proof that the real numbers contains a square root
of 2 uses the completeness of the real numbers, which also counts as
"analysis".

That the rational numbers has an algebraic closure is a purely algebraic
result, with no mention of topology in either the statement or proof.

That the complex numbers is algebraically closed is not an algebraic result:
it has topology built into the statement, and also the proof(s).

That the algebraic closure of the rationals embeds in the complex
numbers has topology in the statement - and I bet also in every proof.

Best,
