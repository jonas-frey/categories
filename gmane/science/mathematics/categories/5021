I don't see how supplying the missing half of an if-and-only-if is "more
sophisticated."  The Yoneda Lemma usually states that J embeds (meaning
fully) in [J^op,Set], but it could just as well state this for any
factor C between J and [J^op,Set].  In such situations it is natural to
ask whether the converse holds; it doesn't, but if one adds to
full-and-faithful the (very natural) requirement of density then it
does: the dense extensions of J are precisely the categories of
presheaves on J, by which I mean the full subcategories of [J^op,Set]
that retain J as a full subcategory (the sense of "on").  I don't call
that sophisticated.

Indeed.  Any branch of mathematics that does so only contributes to the
image of mathematics as a difficult subject.

That's an algorithm.  The relevant theorem is also called the
fundamental theorem of arithmetic.  One could state the essential idea
in sophisticated language as "Z is a principal ideal domain" but the
more usual statement about uniqueness of factorization of positive
integers makes number theory a more accessible subject.

I like Cantor's theorem because, like Euclid's algorithm, it will
survive the revolution Paul is trying to foment here.

As will diagonalization arguments like Cantor's.

Unlike the Fundamental Theorems of Arithmetic and of Algebra, the Yoneda
Lemma has not yet established itself as *the* fundamental theorem of
category theory.  Nor will it unless a reasonable consensus to that
effect emerges.  I suggest waiting a few years before coming to any
conclusion about whether CT has an FT, and if so what it is.
