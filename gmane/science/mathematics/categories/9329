Fred was a great guy and I liked him. His love of language was manifest=0A=
in his writing as well as in his oral communication. It was from his papers=
  that I=0A=
learned the words =93behoove=94 and =93antepenultimate=94. In one paper he =
explained,=0A=
in a precise and understandable way, the theory of triples (aka monads), th=
eir=0A=
algebras and how they relate to adjoints, =85 all in a single sentence!=0A=
=0A=
I first met him when I was a graduate student at McGill in 1968. He was sle=
eping=0A=
on the couch in the lounge with a sign on his chest saying =93Wake me at 2:=
30=94.=0A=
Someone asked, =93Who=92s this?=94. The reply: =93The colloquium speaker.=
=94 He spoke=0A=
(at 2:35) on enriched theories and algebras. One thing he said has stuck wi=
th me.=0A=
The base category was a non-symmetric monoidal category and the algebras we=
re=0A=
contravariant functors into it (if my memory serves me correctly). He said =
there=0A=
may come a time when we have to consider covariant functors as contravarian=
t=0A=
ones on the opposite category.=0A=
=0A=
He was a true original and a great loss to our community.=0A=
