*** Summer School on Higher Topos Theory and Univalent Foundations
*** University of Leeds, UK
*** Monday 24th June to Friday 28th June, 2019

Dear friends and colleagues,

I am writing to let you know that a summer school on Higher Topos
Theory and Univalent Foundations will take place at the University of
Leeds from Monday 24th June to Friday 28th June, 2019.

The goal of the school is to help PhD students and young researchers
to obtain entry points into the areas of Higher Topos Theory and
Univalent Foundations and, perhaps most importantly, learn about
connections between them. This would help future developments in both
subjects, e.g. in the development of elementary higher topos theory.

The school will consist of the following activities.

Mini-courses:
- Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine (Stockholm University), Univalent Foundations
- Charles Rezk (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Higher topos t=
heory

Invited lectures:
- Benedikt Ahrens (University of Birmingham)
- Andr=C3=A9 Joyal (Universit=C3=A9 du Qu=C3=A9bec =C3=A0 Montr=C3=A9al)
- Emily Riehl (Johns Hopkins University)

Tutorials:
- Paige North (Ohio State University)
- Nima Rasekh (Max Planck Institute for Mathematics)
- Karol Szumilo (University of Leeds)

The website of the summer school (currently under construction) can be foun=
d at:

https://conferences.leeds.ac.uk/httuf/

Information about registration and other practical matters will be
available in due course. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to
contact us if you have any queries.

With best regards,
The organizers (Nicola Gambino, Nima Rasekh, Karol Szumilo)
