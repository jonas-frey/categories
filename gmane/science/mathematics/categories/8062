We are delighted to announce the following event:

   A CONFERENCE IN HONOUR OF PRAKASH PANANGADEN
   ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 60TH BIRTHDAY

   * 23--25 May 2014, University of Oxford, UK
   * http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/pf2014
   * Abramsky / Brookes / Coecke / Danos / de Boer / Desharnais / Duncan
/ Gobault-Larrecq / Hayden / Jacobs / Jagadeesan / Jung / Kashefi /
Knight / Kozen / Kupke / Kwiatkowska / Larsen / Mardare / Mislove /
Ouaknine / Palamidessi / Plotkin / Precup / Rutten / Sadrzadeh / Scott
/ Selinger / Silva / Sorkin / van Breugel / Vicary / Winskel / Worrell / Ying

Prakash has made major contributions across a remarkably wide range of
topics, including probabilistic and concurrent computation, logic and
duality, and quantum information and computation. His work is
characterised by the qualities of elegance, clarity and concern for
fundamentals, and has been instrumental in making connections between
different research areas and communities. Equally important for his
many friends has been the infectious enthusiasm and enjoyment he
brings to his scientific work, and the generous and sustained support
and encouragement he has given to many junior colleagues.

The workshop will feature talks by many of Prakash's friends and
collaborators. We anticipate that this will be a very enjoyable event,
blending fun and science - how could a meeting for Prakash be
otherwise! We warmly invite everyone to participate. Information on
how to register can be found on the conference web page.

This event is twinned with a Spring School in Quantum Structures in
Physics and Computer Science, to be held on the dates 19--22 May 2014
at the University of Oxford:

   * http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ss2014

Please circulate this announcement to those who might be interested,
and use the poster available for download on the website to advertise
these events in your institution.

Best wishes,
Samson Abramsky, Bob Coecke and Mike Mislove
