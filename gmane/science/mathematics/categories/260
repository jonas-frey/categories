                               FMCS 2009
       17th Workshop on Foundational Methods in Computer Science
                 University of British Columbia, VANCOUVER, Canada
                         MAY 28th - 31st, 2009

                           THIRD ANNOUNCEMENT

                                 * * *

  FMCS09 now has a website where one can reserve accommodation online.
  The address is

  http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/general-event/foundational-methods-computer-science-2009

  Participants in FMCS 2009 are guaranteed accommodations if reservations
  are made by April 28, 2009 through the link in the preceding web address.
  After April 28 the housing office will not guarantee accommodation for
  our group but will, however, continue to book in the same way as long as
  space is available.

  Reservations can be cancelled without penalty until 48 hours before the
  arrival date so it is to your advantage to book if there is even a slight
  possibility that you may attend.

  The next announcement will contain a more complete list of participants so
  if you are not on the current list of participants and you will or may
  attend, then please send email to johnm@math.ubc.ca with subject heading
  FMCS09 - WILL ATTEND or FMCS09 - MAY ATTEND.

  A preliminary schedule of talks as well as preregistration details will be
  posted on the website by May 4.

  In the meantime those who have never attended an FMCS meeting may wish to
  get an idea of the range of topics by looking at the talks given in 2008
  at Halifax appearing in http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/fmcs2008/

  The following paragraphs repeat the information from the first
  announcement.

  The Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia
  in cooperation with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences
  is hosting the Foundational Methods in Computer Science workshop
  on May 28th - 31st, 2009, on the University of British Columbia
  Campus in Vancouver, Canada

  The workshop is an annual informal meeting intended to bring together
  researchers in mathematics and computer science. There is a focus
  on the application of category theory in computer science. However, all
  those who are interested in category theory or computer science are
  welcome to attend.

  The meeting begins with a reception at 6pm in the Ruth Blair room
  in Walter Gage Towers on the UBC campus on Thursday May 28, 2009.
  The scientific program starts on May 29, and consists of a day of
  tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to category theory, as well as a
  day anda half of research talks. The meeting ends at mid-day on May 31.

  Research talks

  There will be some invited presentations, but the majority of the
  talks are solicited from the participants. If you wish to give a talk
  please send a title and abstract to johnm@math.ubc.ca. Time
  slots are limited, so please register early if you would like to be
  considered for a talk.

  Graduate student participation is particularly encouraged at FMCS.

  Registration details will appear in the next announcement.
