Dear Eduardo,

That's right. Specifically, Set_f here has N for its object of objects,
and something more complicated (but geometrically definable) for its obje=
ct
of morphisms. That way the correct object classifier is defined for any
base topos. (I'm thinking of Grothendieck toposes here, but I guess it
works for any elementary topos with NNO. I even conjecture it does
something useful for arithmetic universes.)

That's a very strong notion of finiteness constructively. It requires not
only Kuratowski finiteness and decidable equality, but even a decidable
total order. Then the category of such finite sets is essentially small,
equivalent to the Set_f I described above. It is the notion of "finite"
needed in finitely presentable algebras, for example in the theorem that
for a finitary algebraic theory T, the T-algebra classifier is
Set^(T-Alg_fp^op), the topos of Set-values functors from the category of
finitely presented algebras. Again, we want T-Alg_fp to be small.

In my paper "Strongly algebraic =3D SFP (topically)" I was interested in =
the
situation where, for a geometric theory T, the classifying topos for T is=
  a
presheaf topos in the form of the topos of Set-valued functors from the
category of finite T-models (and I gave some sufficient conditions for th=
is
to happen). Again, the notion of finite model is this strong notion of
finiteness. However, my main example also involved Kuratowski finite sets=
,
so the paper discusses in some detail the interplay between the different
notions of finiteness.

Regards,

Steve Vickers.
