Another approach more closely resembles the "solution" that George =

Janelidze and I have pointed out for the Boolean problem. To sketch it, =

let me temporarily borrow the old Gelfand-Naimark terminology "normed rin=
g" =

for commutative C*-algebras with unit, and use "normed rng" for their =

not-necessarily-unital counterparts.

As in the Boolean setting, then, "normed rngs" is, to within equivalence,=

augmented "normed rings" (that is, the slice category "normed rings"|'C',=

where C is the "coefficient ring" -- probably the real or the complex =

field in most applications), whence as opposite to "normed rngs" one
immediately deduces the category of pointed compact Hausdorff spaces
(and *all* continuous base-point-preserving functions).

And, as there also, while the complement of the base point in such a
space may be locally compact, the passage to that complement is, again, =

far from functorial -- unless one is willing either to restrict one's
attention, among maps of pointed compact spaces, to those that send
*only* the base point to the base point, or to extend one's attention to
certain only partially defined functions as maps of locally compact space=
s.
