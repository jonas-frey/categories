I also find "linear" an attractive option. Just to circumvent any
confusion (e.g. with linear in the sense of linear logic, or with
the question that may arise: linear over what?), one could say
"N-linear" where N is of course the initial rig, as alluded to by
Ross.  I would hope that "N-linear category" is sufficiently
unambiguous to get the meaning across, and sufficiently snappy.

Best regards,

Todd
