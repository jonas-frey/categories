Hi Tim,

> attended.=20

There are, of course, many people I could have credited and cited in=20
my previous posting, but only the newest readers of this list will be
unaware of the perils with which such an attempt is fraught.  [For=20
instance, I first read of the local presentability of Ban in Adamek=20
and Rosicky's book, but I would not like to hazard a guess as to the=20
origin of this result.]

But you are right: I should have made an exception in Matthias' case.
I should also credit Vladimir Pestov, a topologist who knows enough
category theory to wonder whether operator spaces might be internal=20
Banach spaces in some Grothendieck topos (but perhaps not enough to=20
realise that this might take a student more than one term to prove),
for having introduced me to Matthias several years ago. =20

While at Dalhousie, I gave a talk on Pestov's conjecture; but when=20
I started writing up my notes, I was distracted by an unrelated=20
observation about the category of operator spaces which ultimately=20
led to my ill-fated C*-algebra paper.  I still haven't gotten back=20
to the original project. =20

> I do not know if any version of Matthias' notes is available.=20

Nor do I, but I am sure he would rather point people towards the=20
pre-Wikipedia-era "online dictionary" of operator space theory to=20
which he contributed:=20
[German]  http://www.math.uni-sb.de/ag/wittstock/projekt99.html
[English] http://www.math.uni-sb.de/ag/wittstock/projekt2001.html

These notes are quite good in the sense that, to use Tim's words,=20
they are

> explicitly conscious of the categorical content =20

In particular, it is quite gratifying to see a theorem such as "the=20
forgetful functor from operator spaces to Banach space admits both=20
a left and a right adjoint" stated (more or less) ungrudgingly. =20

Cheers,
Jeff.

P.S. I should say that I don't think that operator spaces would be a=20
suitable topic for an introductory CT course to a general audience;=20
they are rather intricate.  But it might be possible to craft an=20
interesting set of exercises for the functional analysis contingent=20
of such a course around operator space theory. =20
