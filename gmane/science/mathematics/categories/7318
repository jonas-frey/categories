The workshop on formal topology is an international meeting dedicated
to formal topology and related topics, including constructive and
computable topology, point-free topology, and other generalizations of
topology.

This is the fourth of a series of successful meetings on the
development of Formal Topology and its connections with related
approaches. The first three have been held in Padua (1997), Venice
(2002), and Padua (2007).

The importance of higher dimensional structure for mathematics and
computer science has been recognized for a long time. However, recent
connections between homotopy theory and type theory have spurred new
activity that is connecting previously unrelated topics. The workshop
will be a place for meeting and dissemination of ideas between
researchers from different areas who all use higher dimensional
structures.

* Steve Awodey
* Emily Riehl

* Nicola Gambino
* Neil Ghani

* Erik Palmgren
* Randy Pollack
* Urs Schreiber
* Bas Spitters
