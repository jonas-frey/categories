Actually, my question is much more basic.

That's exactly what I said:

All I'm looking for is a general theorem of the form "given a
well-founded relation < on a set X, and a category C, and
such-and-such data, there is an induced functor X -> C."  I don't care
about set-theoretic issues right now, I'm just looking for a place
where someone has written out exactly how to construct such a functor
using the well-foundedness of <.  It seems like it should be a
well-known thing, so that I can just cite it rather than having to
write out my own proof.
