It seems to me the key point here is that the generalized element
characterizations of finite limits (in any category) look just like the
usual element characterizations in sets.   The elements defined over any
object T of an equalizer for parallel arrows f,g:A-->B are exactly those T
elements x:T-->A with fx=gx, and the elements defined over T of  a product
AxB are exactly the pairs <x,y> of one T-element x:T-->A and one y:T-->B.

The same does not hold even for colimits let alone quantifiers.

Of course when I say the elements "are" these i could as well say they
"correspond to" those in the obvious way.  That is an issue for precise
foundations.

Does that seem to you to be the point?

Colin
