This is from memory so there could be some inaccuracies.

I first met John Isbell there since I shared office space with him. He
said that he saw no need to get a room since he could just sleep in the
office.

Peter Freyd's daughters babysat my daughter Eleanor, aged 2, and son
Lauchlin, aged 2 months and my first wife Dorinne often spoke with Pam.

Phreilambud included David Eisenbud for sure, and possibly Eilenberg,
Freyd and others.
