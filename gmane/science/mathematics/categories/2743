There is a `canonical' choice of composition for such `sesquifunctors'
(what follows is presumably folklore and written up somewhere).

Consider the category SDCat of *self-dual* categories: objects are
categories C, equipped with a duality c: C -> C^op (with c^op c = id),
and morphisms F: (C,c) -> (D,d) are functors F:C -> D such that F^op c =
d F. The forgetful SDCat -> Cat admits both adjoints (and SDCat is
actually both monadic and comonadic over Cat): the right adjoint takes a
category A to (A^op x A, s) where s is the switch isomorphism (the
second projection \pi' : A^op x A -> A is the counit of the
adjunction).  We thus get a comonad G on Cat, and sesquifunctors are the
morphisms of the resulting Kleisli category Cat_G, which tells us how to
compose G:D^op x D -> E with F:C^op x C -> D. The composite is G(F^op s,
F)\delta, which agrees indeed with the formula above. (This is  of
course the composite in SDCat via the adjunction)

The counterexamples mentioned in P. Scott's posting concern the lack of
a well-defined *vertical* composition of dinaturals. If one persists on
endowing them with such a composite, one possible approach is to accept
the partiality of this composition and work with *paracategories*.
Pushing this simple idea to its logical conclusion leads to a decent
enough basic theory, which allows to make sense of the fact that `dinats
into a ccc form a cartesian-closed paracat'. See

Hermida, C; Mateus, P.
Paracategories. II. Adjunctions, fibrations and examples from
probabilistic automata theory.
Theoret. Comput. Sci. 311 (2004), no. 1-3, 71--103.

(also available at my homepage  http://maggie.cs.queensu.ca/chermida)

Making a 2-dimensional structure with dinats, using their partial
vertical composition, leads to consider enrichment over ParCat (the
cartesian closed category of paracategories). But whiskering (and
therefore *horizontal* composition) is bound to be a partial operation
as well, so one has to broaden/weaken ParCat to accommodate this fact.
Ultimately, the kind of composite required in Yanosfky's posting:

S,S':C^op x C---->B  T,T':C^op x C ----> B^op U,U':B^op x B --->A
\alpha: S--->S' dinat \alpha': T--->T' dinat \beta: U--->U' dinat
-------------------------------------------------------------------
\beta \circ (\alpha',\alpha)

suggests a *partial multicategory* structure (as introduced in the
article above), with homs in ParCat.
