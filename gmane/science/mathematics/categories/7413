A new study entitled

GRAPHS FOR JUNCTURE

by Kosta Dosen and Zoran Petric (viii+128 pp.)

is available at: http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/~kosta/jun.pdf

Abstract

An alternative foundation for 2-categories is explored by studying
graph-theoretically a partial operation on 2-cells named juncture, which can
replace vertical and horizontal composition. Juncture is a generalized vertical
composition of 2-cells that need not involve the whole target and the whole
source; it may involve them only partially, provided the result is again a
2-cell. Since commuting diagrams of arrows of ordinary categories may be
conceived as invertible 2-cells, this study concerns ordinary category theory
too. The operation of juncture has a connection with proof theory, where it
corresponds to a kind of cut rule on sequents, and it is related also to an
operation on which the notion of operad can be based. The main achievement of
the work is a detailed description of the specific planarity involved in
juncture and graphs of 2-cells, comparable to the usual combinatorial
characterizations of planarity in graph theory.
