  of the candidate or the university where the Ph.D.
  was granted. After a careful consideration, FoLLI has
  decided to accept only dissertations written in
  English. Dissertations produced in 2007 but not written
  in English or not translated will be allowed for
  submission, after translation, also with the call
  next year (for 2008). Respectively, nominations of
  full English translations of theses originally
  written in other language than English and defended
  in 2006 and 2007 will be accepted for consideration
  this year, too.
* Prize
  The prize consists of:
  - a certificate
  - a donation of 2500 euros provided by the E. W. Beth
    Foundation.
  - an invitation to submit the thesis (or a revised
    version of it) to the new series of books in Logic,
    Language and Information to be published by

FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTER SECURITY, AUTOMATED REASONING FOR SECURITY
PROTOCOL ANALYSIS AND ISSUES IN THE THEORY OF SECURITY (FCS-ARSPA-WITS 2008=
)
   Call for Papers
* Background, aim and scope
  Computer security is an established field of computer science of both
  theoretical and practical significance. In recent years, there has
  been increasing interest in logic-based foundations for various
  methods in computer security, including the formal specification,
  analysis and design of security protocols and their applications, the
  formal definition of various aspects of security such as access
  control mechanisms, mobile code security and denial-of-service
  attacks, and the modeling of information flow and its application to
  confidentiality policies, system composition, and covert channel
  analysis.
* WITS is the official annual workshop organised by the IFIP WG 1.7 on
  "Theoretical Foundations of Security Analysis and Design", established
  to promote the investigation on the theoretical foundations of
  security, discovering and promoting new areas of application of
  theoretical techniques in computer security and supporting the
  systematic use of formal techniques in the development of security
  related applications. This is the eighth meeting in the series.
* The workshop FCS continues a tradition, initiated with the Workshops
  on Formal Methods and Security Protocols (FMSP) in 1998 and 1999, then
  with the Workshop on Formal Methods and Computer Security (FMCS) in
  2000, and finally with the LICS satellite Workshop on Foundations of
  Computer Security (FCS) in 2002 through 2005, of bringing together
  formal methods and the security community.
* ARSPA is a series of workshops on Automated Reasoning for Security
  Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers and practitioners
  from both the security and the formal methods communities, from
  academia and industry, who are working on developing and applying
  automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal specification
  and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA workshops were
  held as satellite events of the 2nd International Joint Conference on
  Automated Reasoning (IJCAR'04) and of the 32nd International
  Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP'05),
  respectively.
* FCS and ARSPA have been joining forces since 2006: FCS-ARSPA'06 was
  affiliated with LICS'06, in the context of FLoC'06, and FCS-ARSPA'07
  was affiliated with LICS'07 and ICALP'07.
* The aim of the joint workshop FCS-ARSPA-WITS'08 is to provide a forum
  for continued activity in different areas of computer security,
  bringing computer security researchers in closer contact with the LICS
  community and giving LICS attendees an opportunity to talk to experts
  in computer security, on the one hand, and contribute to bridging the
  gap between logical methods and computer security foundations, on the
  other.
* Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
  Automated reasoning techniques
  Composition issues
  Formal specification
  Foundations of verification
  Information flow analysis
  Language-based security
  Logic-based design
  Program transformation
  Security models
  Static analysis
  Statistical methods

  Submissions should be at most 15 pages (a4paper, 11pt), including
  references. The cover page should include title, names of authors,
  co-ordinates of the corresponding author, an abstract, and a list of
  keywords. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected
  immediately. Additional material intended for the referees but not for
  publication in the final version - for example details of proofs - may
  be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the
  page limit.
  Authors are invited to submit their papers electronically, as portable
  document format (pdf) or postscript (ps); please, do not send files
  fomatted for work processing packages (e.g., Microsoft Word or

  design and implementation on the one hand and their applications in
  for example proof-carrying code have been the focus of considerable
  research over the last two decades. This workshop will bring together
  designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss all aspects of
  logical frameworks and variable binding.
* The broad subject areas of LFMTP'08 are:
  - The automation and implementation of the meta-theory of programming
    languages and related calculi, particularly work which involves
    variable binding and fresh name generation.
  - The theoretical and practical issues concerning the encoding of
    variable binding and fresh name generation, especially the
    representation of, and reasoning about, datatypes defined from
    binding
    signatures.
  - Case studies of meta-programming, and the mechanization of the
    (meta)theory of descriptions of programming languages and other
    calculi.  Papers focusing on logic translations and on experiences
    with encoding programming languages theory are particularly welcome.
* Topics include, but are not limited to
  - logical framework design
  - meta-theoretic analysis
  - applications and comparative studies
  - implementation techniques
  - efficient proof representation and validation
  - proof-generating decision procedures and theorem provers
  - proof-carrying code
  - substructural frameworks
  - semantic foundations
  - methods for reasoning about logics

SECOND INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON PROOF-CARRYING CODE (PCC 2008)
  Call for Papers
  22 June 2008
  Carnegie Mellon University
  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA
  http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/pcc08/
* PCC 2008 is a joint LICS and CSF affiliated workshop on Proof-Carrying
  Code.
* Proof-carrying code is an important and distinctive approach to
  enhancing trust in programs. It provides a practical framework for
  independent assurance of program behaviour; especially where source
  code is not available, or the code author and user are unknown to
  each other.
* The workshop will address theoretical foundations of proof-carrying
  code as well as practical examples and work on alternative application
  domains. Here "proof" is construed broadly, to include not just
  mathematical derivations but any formal evidence that supports the
  static analysis of programs. That is, evidence about an intrinsic
  property of code and its behaviour that can be independently checked
  by any user, intermediary, or third party. These manifest guarantees
  mean that PCC raises trust in the code itself, distinct from and
  complementary to any existing trust in the creator of the code, the
  process used to produce it, or its distributor.
* Topics include:
  - PCC addressing properties of safety, security, and correctness
    such as:
          Memory safety, information flow, declassification, resource
          management, access control, protocol enforcement, functional
          correctness.
  - Examples of PCC in application domains, including but not
    limited to:
          Mobile code, mobile devices, operating systems, grid
          computing, peer-to-peer computing, active networks, embedded
          systems, cloud computing, databases, e-Science.
  - Probabilistically-checkable proofs, zero-knowledge proofs,
    proof-on-demand.
  - Trust and policy frameworks; supporting modular and extensible
    systems; compositionality in code and proofs.
  - Certifying compilation, proof-transforming compilation,
    certified verifiers.
  - Logics and notions of certificate specific to proof-carrying
    frameworks.

6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FORMAL MODELLING AND  ANALYSIS OF
  TIMED SYSTEMS (FORMATS'08)
  Saint-Malo, France, September 15--17, 2008
  (Co-Located with QEST'08 : www.qest.org)
  http://formats08.inria.fr
* Submission Deadline : **May 12th**, 2008
  Submission is now open
  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dformats08
* Objectives and Scope of the Conference
  Timing aspects of  systems from a variety of  computer science domains
  have been treated independently by different communities.  Researchers
  interested in  semantics, verification and  performance analysis study
  models  such as  timed automata  and  timed Petri  nets.  The  digital
  design  community focuses  on propagation  and switching  delays while
  designers of  embedded controllers  have to take  account of  the time
  taken  by controllers to  compute their  responses after  sampling the
  environment.
  Timing related  questions in these separate disciplines  do have their
  particularities. However, there is  a growing awareness that there are
  basic  problems that are  common to  all of  them. In  particular, all
  these  sub-disciplines  treat  systems  whose behaviour  depends  upon
  combinations of logical  and temporal constraints; namely, constraints
  on the temporal distances between occurrences of events.
  The  aim  of  FORMATS is  to  promote  the  study of  fundamental  and
  practical aspects of timed  systems, and to bring together researchers
  from  different  disciplines that  share  interests  in modelling  and
  analysis of timed systems. Typical topics include (but are not limited
  to):
  - Foundations  and  Semantics:  Theoretical foundations  of  timed
   systems and languages; comparison between different models (timed
   automata,  timed  Petri  nets,  hybrid  automata,  timed  process
   algebra, max-plus algebra,  probabilistic models).
  - Methods and Tools:  techniques, algorithms, data structures, and
   software tools for analyzing timed systems and resolving temporal
   constraints  (scheduling,  worst-case  execution  time  analysis,
   optimisation, model-checking, testing, constraint solving, etc).
   - Applications:   adaptation   and   specialization   of   timing
   technology  in  application  domains  in which  timing  plays  an
   important  role  (real-time   software,  hardware  circuits,  and
   problems of scheduling in manufacturing and telecommunication).
* Submission and Publication:
  The proceedings  of FORMATS'08  will be published  by Springer  in the
  Lecture Notes in Computer  Scienceseries. Papers must contain original
  contributions, be clearly  written, and include appropriate references
  to and comparison with  related work. Simultaneous submission to other
  conferences  with published  proceedings is  not  allowed. Submissions
  should  not exceed  15 pages,  and  should be  formatted according  to
  Springer  LNCS  guidelines.  If   necessary,  the  submission  may  be
  supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be reviewed at
  the discretion of the program committee.

  FMCAD 2008 is the eighth in a series of conferences on the theory and
  application of formal methods in hardware and system design and
  verification. In 2005, the bi-annual FMCAD and sister conference
  CHARME decided to merge to form an annual conference with a unified
  community. The resulting unified FMCAD provides a leading
  international forum to researchers and practitioners in academia and
  industry for presenting and discussing groundbreaking methods,
  technologies, theoretical results, and tools for formally reasoning
  about computing systems, as well as open challenges therein.  Topics
  of interest for the technical program include, but are not limited to:
  - Foundations: advancing industrial-strength technologies in model
    checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and
    refinement techniques, property-preserving reduction techniques,
    compositional methods, decision procedures, SAT- and BDD-based
    methods, combining deductive methods with decision procedures, and
    probabilistic methods.
  - Verification applications: tools, industrial experience reports,
    and case studies.  We encourage the submission of materials
    relating to novel and challenging industrial-scale applications of
    formal methods, including problem domains where formal methods
    worked well or even fell short. We also encourage submissions
    relating to the development and execution of methodologies for
    formal and informal verification strategies.
  - Applications of formal methods in design: topics relating to the
    application and applicability of assertion-based verification,
    equivalence checking, transaction-level verification, semi-formal
    verification, runtime verification, simulation and testcase
    generation, coverage analysis, microcode verification, embedded
    systems, software verification, concurrent systems, timing
    verification, and formal approaches to performance and power.
  - Model-based approaches: modeling and specification languages,
    system-level design and verification, design derivation and
    transformation, and correct-by-construction methods.
  - Formal methods for the design and verification of emerging and
    novel technologies: nano, quantum, biological, video, gaming, and
    multimedia applications.
* Paper Submission
  Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format through the
  FMCAD'08 web site, http://fmcad.org/2008. The proceedings will be
  published by ACM and will be available online in the ACM Digital
  Library and the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Two categories of papers
  can be submitted: regular papers (8 pages), containing original
  research that has not been previously published, nor concurrently
  submitted for publication; and short papers (4 pages), describing
  applications, case studies, industrial experience reports, emerging
  results, or implemented tools with novel features.
  Regular and short papers must use the IEEE Transactions format on
  letter-size paper with a 10-point font size (see
  http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html).
  We recommend that self-citations be written in the third person, though
  authors will be required to identify themselves on their submissions.
  Submissions must contain original research that has not been
  previously published, nor concurrently submitted for publication. Any
  partial overlap with any published or concurrently submitted paper
  must be clearly indicated. If experimental results are reported,
  authors are strongly encouraged to provide adequate access to their
  data so that results can be independently verified.
  A small number of accepted papers will be considered for a
  distinguished paper award.

PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS WORKSHOP (PERMIS'08)
  Call for Papers
  August 19-21, 2008
  http://www.isd.mel.nist.gov/PerMIS_2008
  Washington DC, U.S.A.
* PerMIS'08 will be the eighth in the series that started
  in 2000, targeted at defining measures and methodologies of evaluating
  performance of intelligent systems. The workshop has proved to be an
  excellent forum for discussions and partnerships, dissemination of
  ideas, and future collaborations in an informal setting. Attendees
  usually include researchers, graduate students, practitioners from
  industry, academia, and government agencies.
* PerMIS'08 aims at identifying and quantifying contributions of
  functional intelligence towards achieving success. Our working
  definition of functional intelligence is the ability to act
  appropriately in an uncertain environment, where appropriate action is
  that which increases the probability of success, and success is
  the achievement of behavioral goals (J. Albus, 1991). In addition to
  the main theme, as in previous years, the workshop will focus on
  applications of performance measures to practical problems in
  commercial, industrial, homeland security, and military applications.
* Topic areas include, but are not limited to:
  - Defining and measuring aspects of a system:
        The level of autonomy
        Human-robot interaction
        Collaboration & Coordination
        Taxonomies
  - Evaluating components within intelligent systems:
        Sensing and perception
        Knowledge representation, world models, ontologies
        Planning and control
        Learning and adapting
        Reasoning
  - Infrastructural support for performance evaluation:
        Testbeds and competitions for intercomparisons
        Instrumentation and other measurement tools
        Simulation and modeling support
  - Technology readiness measures for intelligent systems
  - Applied performance measures in various domains, e.g.,
        Intelligent transportation systems
        Emergency response robots (search and rescue, bomb disposal)
        Homeland security systems
        De-mining robots
        Defense robotics
        Hazardous environments (e.g., nuclear remediation)
        Industrial and manufacturing systems
        Space/Aerial  robotics
        Medical Robotics & assistive devices

 Affiliated workshop of the 12th IEEE International EDOC Conference
* DESCRIPTION
 The capability of rapidly adapting systems and processes to an
 ever-changing environment to leverage existing resources has become a
 crucial factor of an organization's agility. The traditional approach
 to process management is only partially appropriate to this new
 context, and calls for the advent of new, dynamic business processes.
 Broad business policies or narrower constraints of technical nature
 make dynamic business process particularly suited to a declarative
 approach to their modelling and design.

 Topics of the workshop include but are not limited to:
 - Dynamic business process modelling
 - Implementation issues for dynamic processes
 - Tools for dynamic processes
 - Use cases of dynamic processes
 - Business and technical requirements for dynamic processes
 - Declarative model specification
 - Mathematical and logical foundations of declarative business
   processes
 - Formal models of declarative business processes
 - Monitoring of declarative business processes
 - Validation of declarative business processes
 - Tools for declarative business processes

BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT: PRINCIPLES OF MODEL CHECKING
  by Christel Baier and Joost-Pieter Katoen
  MIT Press 2008, 993 pages
  ISBN: 978-0-262-02649-9
* Principles of Model Checking offers a comprehensive introduction to
  model checking that is not only a text suitable for classroom use but
  also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the
  field.
* The book begins with the basic principles for modeling concurrent
  and communicating systems, introduces different classes of properties
  (including safety and liveness), presents the notion of fairness, and
  provides automata-based algorithms for these properties. It introduces
  the temporal logics LTL and CTL, compares them, and covers algorithms
  for verifying these logics, discussing real-time systems as well as
  systems subject to random phenomena. Separate chapters treat such
  efficiency-improving techniques as abstraction and symbolic
  manipulation. The book includes an extensive set of examples (most of
  which run through several chapters) and a complete set of basic
  results accompanied by detailed proofs. Each chapter concludes with
  a summary, bibliographic notes, and an extensive list of exercises
  of both practical and theoretical nature.
* Complementary material such as slides and solutions to selected
  exercises will be made available to lecturers.
* Foreword by Kim G. Larsen; endorsements by Moshe Vardi and Gerard
  Holzmann
* Further information can be found at:
