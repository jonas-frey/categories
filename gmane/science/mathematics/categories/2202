                              Workshop on

     CATEGORICAL METHODS FOR CONCURRENCY, INTERACTION, AND MOBILITY

                  Marseille, France, 6 September 2003


                       affiliated with CONCUR 2003

                    and held together with GETCO 2003


                            Call for Papers

Aims and Scope:

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers applying
category theory to concurrency, interaction, or mobility. Topics of
interest include, but are not limited to:

   categorical algebras of processes
   categorical methods in game semantics and geometry of interaction
   categorical models of term/graph rewriting or rewriting logic
   Chu spaces
   coalgebras, bialgebras, coinduction
   comparing models of concurrency
   enriched categories of processes
   interaction categories
   presheaf models


GETCO'03:

Due to the close relation between geometric and topological methods on
the one hand and categorical methods on the other hand, CMCIM'03 will
be held jointly with the workshop on Geometric and Toplogical Methods
in Concurrency Theory (GETCO'03). Both workshops will be on the same
day with their talks not overlapping.


Invited Lecture:

   Glynn Winskel

It is planned to publish the proceedings of the meeting as a volume in
Elsevier's ENTCS series. Papers must contain original
contributions. Papers should be submitted as PostScript files by email
to cmcim03@mcs.le.ac.uk, containing `CMCIM-submission' in the subject. A
separate message should also be sent (subject: CMCIM-abstract),
containing authors, title, and a text-only abstract.
