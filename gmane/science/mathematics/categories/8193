It is known that REL (also denoted as COR) has biproducts, even products =
which are also sums for small infinite indexation.
We can give examples that  some kernel, some cokernel, some image or =
some coimage do not exist
(see :  Davar-Panah, Th=E8se de 3=E8me cycle, Paris, 1968 ;   Guitart, =
Th=E8se de 3=E8me cycle, Paris, 1970).
For the lack of splitting idempotents : =20
the completion of REL with respect to splitting idempotents is  the =
category of complete completely  distributive lattices, with sup =
compatible maps (R. Guitart and J. Riguet, Enveloppe karoubienne de =
cat=E9gories de Kleisli, CTGDC, XXXIII-3 (1992), p. 261-266).=20
The case of {0,1} it is clear because a preorder is splittable if and =
only if it is an equivalence relation (Prop. 5 in Guitart-Riguet). It is =
  also  indicated exactly when an idempotents split in REL.=20
In fact the construction in Guitart-Riguet works for any Kleisli =
category i.e. category of free algebras, and if the monad (T, u,m) on C =
is with T an injective map, then the completion of Kl(T) is the full =
subcategory of EM(T) with objects U_T-projective algebras.  So  =
idempotents split in Kl(T) if and only if every projective algebra is =
free.
This analysis works also for the description of the splitting of =
idempotent of the category of continuous relations between compact =
spaces: cf. my talk at the PSSL 51, Valenciennes, 13-14 f=E9vrier 1993 =
(An unpublished paper available on my page, in the section preprint).
