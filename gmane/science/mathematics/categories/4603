The three books I have authored or co-authored all contain a chapter of
about 40 pages that is an introduction to category theory.  They are
largely identical (the one for Acyclic Models has a an added section on
categories of fractions, needed for that book).  The one in TTT is already
freely available and, with Charles's permission, I would happily post that
in whatever place you would like.
