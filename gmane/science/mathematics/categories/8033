Rel does have products and coproducts; they coincide (by self-duality)
and are just disjoint unions of sets. If's not hard to see that
a relation R \subseteq A \times B is a monomorphism A \to B iff the
map PA \to PB sending a subset of A to the set of all R-relatives
of its members is injective; dually for epimorphisms. Rel has very few
(co)limits other than (co)products; it doesn't even have splittings of
all idempotents. (All symmetric idempotents have splittings, but the
order-relation \leq \subseteq {0,1} \times {0,1} can't be split.)

However, I don't think that the self-duality is in any sense
responsible for the lack of (co)limits in Rel. The category of
complete join-semilattices is self-dual, and is complete and cocomplete.
