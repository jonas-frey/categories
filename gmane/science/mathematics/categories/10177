Dear Categorists,

In response to the current pandemic, the organizers of the

35th Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications
https://ysu.edu/sumtopo

informed the session organizers today of the cancellation of the event.
As a corollary, the planned special session on

Enriched Categories and Topology

at the conference (as announced earlier this year on this list) can
unfortunately not take place.

There are currently no plans to hold the session at some other time or
venue.

Thanks to everybody who indicated interest in the session.

Walter
