Dear all,

This is a reminder about the Workshop on Homotopy Type Theory and
Univalent Foundations to be held at the Fields Institute in Toronto,
May 16-20, 2016. The workshop will consist of mini-courses on several
aspects of Homotopy Type Theory, as well as research talks, both
invited and contributed. The registration and abstract submission are
available at:

http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/15-16/homotopy-type/

Limited financial support is available to cover participants' travel
and local expenses. Priority will be given to junior researchers and
those without other sources of funding. To be considered for funding,
please fill out the Funding Application Form which is a part of the
online registration.

Important dates:
* Funding application deadline: February 28, 2016.
* Contributed talk submission deadline: February 28, 2016.
* Registration deadline: May 2, 2016. (Early registration is
appreciated, to help us in our planning.)

Program:

Mini-courses

Robert Harper (Carnegie Mellon University): Computational Higher Type Theory
Daniel R. Licata (Wesleyan University): Cubical Type Theory
Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine (Stockholm University): Homotopy-theoretic
models of type theory
Michael Shulman (University of San Diego): Synthetic Homotopy Theory

Invited speakers

Benedikt Ahrens (IAS, Princeton)
Thorsten Altenkirch (University of Nottingham)
Jeremy Avigad (Carnegie Mellon University)
Emily Riehl (Johns Hopkins University)
Michael Warren (HRL Laboratories)

We are looking forward to seeing you in Toronto!
