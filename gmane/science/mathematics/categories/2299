A textbook (unfortunately long out of print)
that seems quite suitable in both content and level
to your need is:

Ehrig, Kiermeier, Kreowski and K\:uhnel
Universal Theory of Automata
Teubner, 1974, 240pp.

Also, in response Juergen's remark that
"classical automata theory" is a rather horrible mess,
one most distinguished categorist evidently agreed with him
and responded by writing two ~400 page books on the subject:

Samuel Eilenberg
Automata, Languages and Machines
Academic Press, 1974 and 1976.

They make no explicit use of categorical notions nor language,
but considering the author and date the categorical spirit
surely prevails.
Note also his book with Elgot on Recursiveness.

Best, Keith
