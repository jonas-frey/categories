Dear Colleagues,
   Registration is now open for MFPS 25, which will take place at
Oxford from April 3 through April 7. A list of accepted papers and an
outline program are also available. Participants will be housed either
in University College or in Linton Lodge, a hotel located not far from
the Computer Laboratory where the meetings will take place. We offer
reduced registration fees for students and for faculty who attend only
the last two days of the program.
   To register for the meeting, please point your browser at http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps25
  Accommodations are being held only until March 24, so please
register before then to reserve a room.
   Thanks, and best regards,
   Mike Mislove
