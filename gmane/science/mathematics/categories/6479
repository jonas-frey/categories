3 PhD positions in "The logic of composite quantum systems" in the
Netherlands

The above research project, jointly led by the undersigned, has been
approved for funding by the Dutch Research Organization (NWO) in its
TOP-GO Programme. This project involves areas like category theory
(especially topos theory and tensor categories), quantum logic, quantum
computation, C*-algebras, and compositional reasoning. It has, very
roughly, been split into three subprojects on modularity in quantum
computation,  the construction of toposes with a nontrivial tensor
structure, and the development of the internal logic of =91tensor toposes=
=92.

Candidates with a (prospective) M.Sc degree in mathematics, computer
science, or theoretical physics (the latter two with a strong
mathematical component), or an equivalent thereof (such as the Cambridge
Part III Certificate, etc.), preferably those already familiar with one
or more of the areas just mentioned (and interested in the others), are
encouraged to apply to one or more of us. Please include a CV, a list of
courses and grades at the master's level, a (draft) M.Sc thesis if
available, and the names and email addresses of at least two scientific
referees.

A suitable starting date would be September 1, 2011, but this is
flexible. The appointment will be for 4 years, of which the first year
is a trial period. Such PhD trajectories in the Netherlands are paid
positions: the gross salary for PhD students in the Netherlands is
currently 2042, 2379, 2492, 2612 euro per month in year 1, 2, 3, 4,
respectively, from which 42% tax and insurance costs will be deducted.
There will be a teaching duty of approximately 0,2 fte, typically spent
supervising exercise classes and correcting students' homework.

We are looking forward to hearing from you before March 1, 2011.
Females are especially encouraged to apply.
