Dear Categorists,

there are, at the Instituto de Matem?ticas at UNAM, Mexico City, some
postdoctoral positions for one year, renewable for another year. The
deadline for the ones that start in September 2013 is
this coming February 28, but there will be another opportunity for the
ones that start in March 2014. There is some information at the
Instituto's web page

www.matem.unam.mx

The candidate must be under 36 years old at the beginning of the postdoc,
must have
obtained the doctorate within three years of the beginning of the postdoc,
and must have published or accepted articles in respectable journals (I'd
say TAC). I would prefer it if the
candidate has some affinity with the work on categories done at the
Instituto (that is,
basically, with what I do).

If you know some good, promising, suitable young categorist, please refer
them to me.
