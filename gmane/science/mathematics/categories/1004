I may have misunderstood, but I didn't think anyone even implied that
Grothendieck could be credited with *-autonomous categories. Juergen was just
asking about the history of the idea of dualizing object, which is just a part
of that structure, and certainly predates it.

The fact that an idea may have been in the air before it was captured in a
structure does not have to decrease the merit of capturing it; on the
contrary, it may also be thought of as a sign that it was an important idea,
or that capturing it wasn't easy. The fact that Wiles was drawing upon a rich
source of ideas does not devaluate his victory.

This is a remarkable phenomenon, isn't it? Cartesius also knew nothing of
Cartesian categories (or squares, or arrows...), and Frobenius could hardly
recognize the logical form of his reciprocity...

I think Etruscans had this religion, where they systematically attributed all
victories to the ancestors, so that the soldiers wouldn't take things too
personally.
