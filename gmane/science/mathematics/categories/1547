I think I can provide some meaningful answers to these questions, but of
course, one should always take such (throwaway) remarks in an informal
exposition with a pinch of black pepper.

Fibrations as finite-limit theories: This follows from the analysis in
[S], that exhibits fibrations as (adjoint) pseudo-algebras in any 2-category
with comma-objects. In particular, for any category B with pullbacks, the
2-category Cat(B) of internal categories in B admits them.

Split fibrations: Since fibrations are pseudo-algebras, it follows from Power's

coherence theorem [P] (which applies in this situation) that every fibration is

equivalent (over its base category) to a split one. The construction there does

not appeal to Yoneda. Yet, given that fibrations are actually properties, that
is adjoint pseudo-algebras, one can give a neat explicit description of the
associated split one as follows:

Given p:E->B, consider the free fibration over it, E/p -> B. The unit
\eta: E -> E/p takes X |-> X,id_(pX). The right adjoint r: E/p -> E amounts to
a choice of cartesian lifting: (Y,u:I->pY) |-> u*(Y). Thus we get a comonad
\eta o r: E/p -> E/p. The resulting Kleisli category (E/p)_(\eta r) is fibred
over B and gives the corresponding split fibration. The equivalence is given by
the composite E -\eta-> E/p -J-> (E/p)_(\eta r).

The above construction is a special case of the theory in [H], specially
section 11. The paper and the references there in provide further material on
coherence.

Generalised fibrations: The only meaningful generalisation (in the categorical
context) proposed so far in the literature is that of [S1], fibrations "up to
equivalence". However I can see no impediment whatsoever at taking 2-category
theory seriously with the standard (Grothendieck) notion of fibration, so I
cannot guess what the author means.
