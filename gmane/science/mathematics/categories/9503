Does anyone know an example of a a topos E with nno validating
internal countable choice (ICC), i.e. (-)^N preserves epis, such that
some booleanization of E doesn't validate (ICC) anymore?

In particular I am interested in the case where E is a relative
realizability topos induced by a pca A together with a sub-pca A_#.
For a particular such case I managed to answer the question positively
(see https://lmcs.episciences.org/4129/pdf) using a variant of Spector's
bar recursion. But I don't know the answer when I make the underlying
pca's of loc.cit. effective.
Another situation where I also don't know the answer is KV_{\neg_U\neg_U}
where KV is the Kleene-Vesley topos (see Jaap van Oosten's book) and U
is {\tau} where \tau decides the halting problem.

I think - or rather hope - that in these two latter cases
booleanization does not preserve (ICC). But for already quite some
time I failed to prove this.

Only recently I realized that I don't know any example where
booleanization does destroy (ICC). So I would be very glad to learn about
such an example.
