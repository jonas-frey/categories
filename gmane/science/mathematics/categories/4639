Dear Andr=E9 Joyal,

At 01:55 PM 9/25/2008, you wrote:
(i) Some peoples have expressed doubts about the feasability.
(ii) we should make sure that iBourbaki can last for more than one=
 generation.
(iii) We need to conciliate long term duration=20
with the rapid developpement of technology.
(iv) My task at this point is to convince peoples=20
that the project is worthy and feasable.

  If it will be useful to distinguish between (a)=20
mathematicians informally doing mathematics at a=20
blackboard or on a shared napkin or pad, and (b)=20
formally composing mathematical exposition in,=20
say, LaTeX supplemented by software technology=20
for diagrams (e.g., xy-pic and Xfig), then my=20
project is relevant solely to (a).  It seems to=20
me that both (a) and (b) are necessary for the Subject.

Imagine (a) a mathematics discussion forum with a=20
conversation like that on the categories=20
listserv,  except augmented by the ability to=20
draw and edit all kinds of mathematical=20
expressions and diagrams (it has been said that=20
"The Bourbaki were Puritans, and Puritans are=20
strongly opposed to pictorial representations of=20
truths of their faith."),  and (b) a Wiki-like=20
peer-generated-and-reviewed presentation of=20
research, report, and tutorial material=20
with  links back to the discussions, arguments,=20
and diagrams in (a).  All students of mathematics=20
should be allowed to visit the forum, perhaps=20
like a virtual Gallery of the Senate Chamber=20
combined with the MIT OpenCourseWare initiative.

( (i), (iv) )
Regarding feasibility of (a), last year I=20
sketched a possible algorithm intended to=20
address  basic issues of presence and=20
registration in a paper available at=20
http://distancedrawing.com/Napkin071215a.pdf .

A revision of that algorithm substitutes (1)=20
webcam USB technology for digital video camera=20
technology, and (2) the browser protocol for instant messaging.

Perhaps the AJAX design pattern called HTTP=20
Streaming -- a long-lived HTTP connection  with=20
each collaborator -- might be worth=20
investigating. A merging algorithm for  multiple=20
independently generated images to create a single=20
"virtual drawing" is described in the aforementioned paper.

The open source project I am proposing would=20
combine forum software like=20
http://www.yetanotherforum.net/ with webcam software.

( (ii), (iii) )
With regard to (b) there will be not only=20
development of computer technology, but also=20
development of mathematical technology. Someday=20
might there be something that is as much beyond=20
category theory as category theory is beyond Bourbaki?

Strictly speaking, the Subject and this project=20
are not about categories.  I wonder how you think=20
this discussion should be diverted to a separate=20
stream and joined just by those keenly interested in (i)-(iv).

Ellis
