Dear all,

the Mathematics Subject Classification will soon be revised by
Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt, aiming at a new edition,
MSC2020.  They are soliciting suggestions and feedback until
August 8th.

Three of us (Emily Riehl, Steve Lack, Joachim Kock) have been
collaborating on a proposal for Section 18 (Category theory;
homological algebra).  The main point of the proposal is to
create new subsections

    18H Higher categories and homotopical algebra
    18M Monoidal categories and operads,

big subfields of category theory where it is particularly
difficult to find good entries in the MSC2010.  We also
take the opportunity to propose some adjustments in the
existing subsections of 18.  The proposed new Section 18 is
included below in plain text.  A more detailed document, with
change comments, can be accessed at this link:

    https://www.dropbox.com/s/yr400e893uhhctm/MSC2020.pdf?dl=0

We are still fine-tuning the proposal.

Before submitting the proposal (one week from now), we would
like to request last-minute feedback from the category theory
community, either on this mailing list or in private.

We also invite you to co-sign the proposal.

We are sorry for getting this proposal out so late.
But this is only the starting point: the next phase in the
timeline set out by MR and zbMATH is 12 months of community
feedback, so there will still be plenty of time for
discussion.


Best wishes,

Emily Riehl, Joachim Kock, Steve Lack.
