Hello category theorists,

I've been working with tensor products of categories of
various degrees of cocompletion. What I mean is that I'm
considering categories which are J-cocomplete for some class
of small categories J, that is it has all colimits
of diagrams for all shapes in J. I know that Kelly gives a
tensor product for such things when J is small in section
6.5 of his book on Enriched Category Theory, but I'm working
with large J, including when J has all categories, and
then we're talking about cocomplete categories. I think these things
must have been considered somewhere, and I'm hoping you can
help me find a reference.
