How about talking about simultaneously existing results in several
categories? The Noetherian isomorphism theorems, while not necessarily the
easiest to nail down exactly when they hold, have always been a strong
motivator at the back of my head for why one might want to look at
algebraic entities codifying things like "All Xs and maps between them".
