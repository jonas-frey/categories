On Hewitt's Inconsistency Robustness, and given that my original posting
was related to category theory as a metalanguage for logic in the sense
of explaining extensions of the Goguen-Burstall and Meseguer approaches,
phrases like "mathematics is inconsistent" and "proof does not
intuitively increase our confidence in the consistency of mathematics"
(appear in Hewitt's paper) really make no sense at all.

Martin Escardo in his first reply to my posting says "I am not sure why
these questions are being asked in this list". My simple reply is
because my posting was suggesting to debate the use of category theory
as a the underlying language for logic. Basically none of the replies to
my posting has so far anything to do with category theory.

Hewitt says "A mathematical theory is an extension of mathematics whose
proofs are computationally enumerable." which basically means he says
logic is an extension of mathematics. Logic is part of mathematics as a
discipline, so logic cannot be the external canon for mathematics as
little as philosophy can be the external canon for science. Nothing is
global or canonic as far as mathematics is concerned. Many have tried to
do so, but their is no consensus in that direction. Hewitt's note
confirms that quite clearly.

"Philosophy and mathematics can have a genuine connection", but that
doesn't lead to anything useful. It just adds to fragmentation of the
understanding of foundations. With category theory underlying type
theory we believe we can manage type constructors more formally without
restarting foundations a la HoTT.

In Hewitt's note I am surprised not to see anything written about the
'iota' and 'o' types when speaking about Church. These are key types in
the categorical description of the "lativity" of logic I mentioned
earlier, and universal algebra comes short to deal with them. That
lativity is important also otherwise. Proof mechanisms come after (not
before or during) the bags of terms and sentences have been closed and
sealed. So statements and enumerations involving proofs are not
sentences in that sealed bag. This is the principle of lativity not
respected by traditional logic where the metalanguage is absent. With
categories in the meta for logic, we have term monads because we need
substitutions to compose, but we only have sentence functors. A
sentences functor being a monad simply means those sentences are terms.
We have also said that an unquantified proposition P is not a sentence.
It's a term. Quantifying it makes it a sentence, but then we have
problems with the negation. The "not" before a P (as a term) is really
different from a "not" before a quantifier, isn't it? Traditionally not,
but when we start to construct terms and sentences otherwise than using
natural language, we see it more clearly.

All this is overlooked in traditional logic, and having category theory
as a metalanguage for constructing terms and sentences, respectively as
monads and functors, gives us something new to think about. This is our
credo.

Languages are more or less formal. Languages are more or less
mathematically defined. Whatever the situation, if an object language
allows less formal outsiders to be invoked side by side with its
underlying metalanguage, ugly gets even worse.

Best,

Patrik
