Michael,

I think Christopher Zeemann did something on this in or around  the 1950s
but cannot at the moment access mathscinet to check.

In the 1970s several of us extended Pontrjagin duality:
15.  (with P.J. HIGGINS and S.A. MORRIS), ``Countable products of
lines  and circles: their closed subgroups, quotients and duality
properties'',  {\em Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.} 78 (1975) 19-32.
in particular defining `strong duality'.

Ronnie
