FM'08: 15TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FORMAL METHODS


May 26 - 30, 2008

=C5bo Akademi University

Turku, Finland



CALL FOR PARTICIPATION



http://www.fm2008.abo.fi/



It is our pleasure to invite you to FM'08, the premier international foru=
m
for practitioners and researchers applying mathematical methods to the
design of highly reliable computer systems.

FM'08 is the fifteenth in a series of symposia organized by Formal Method=
s
Europe, http://www.fmeurope.org, an independent association whose aim is
to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for software
development. The symposia have been notably successful in bringing
together innovators and practitioners in precise mathematical methods for
software development, industrial users as well as researchers.



A program of five invited talks and 23 outstanding research papers
provides the opportunity to learn about the newest developments in the
theory and application of formal methods. The program covers a wide range
of topics, including real-time and concurrency, design, verification,
communication, runtime monitoring and analysis, constraint analysis,
programming language analysis, formal methods practice, and grand
challenge problems. As in the previous years, an Industry Day is dedicate=
d
for practitioners to share their experiences with industrial applications=
.
This year's Industry Day investigates telecommunications and embedded
systems, being supported by NOKIA. Speakers from five major industries
will address this year's theme, together with the Johnson Professor Arvin=
d
from MIT.

Tutorials are a central part of this year=92s FM symposium, as an effecti=
ve
way of disseminating emerging application areas, tools, and techniques.
This year we have seven tutorials, given by renowned experts in their
fields. The five co-located workshops address issues of specific formal
techniques as well as novel computational models and grand challenges. Th=
e
following list of tutorials and workshops are available:

Tutorials

=B7         Computational Systems Biology

=B7         Teaching formal methods to students in high school and
introductory university courses

=B7         Event-B and the Rodin Platform

=B7         Why formal verification remains on the fringes of commercial
development

=B7         Formal Methods and Signal Processing

=B7         Runtime Model Checking of Multithreaded C Programs using
Automated Instrumentation Dynamic Partial Order Reduction and Distributed
Checking

=B7         Formal modelling and analysis of real-time systems using UPPA=
AL



Workshops

=B7         Formal aspects of virtual organisations

=B7         Overture/VDM++

=B7         Refinement workshop

=B7         Pilot Projects for the Grand Challenge in Verified Software

=B7         Computational Models for Cell Processes

A Doctoral Symposium on all aspects of formal methods research is also
part of FM=9208, giving young researchers the opportunity to have their
ideas critically, but constructively examined by the community. A Poster
and Tool Exhibition of both research projects and commercial tools allows
researchers to engage in a dialogue with potential users in early phases
of their work. The submission date for the both the Doctoral Symposium an=
d
the Poster and Tool Exhibition is March 7.

Registration to all types of events will open during week 8, with the
possibility of early registration until March 25. Important dates for
submitting papers to the workshops should be identified via the own
homepages of these events, reachable from above or from the FM=9208 websi=
te.
Generally, workshop papers should be submitted in March. The list of the
accepted papers to the technical symposium and the preliminary schedule o=
f
FM=9208 can already be retrieved via our website.

We hope you will enjoy a rewarding symposium program!

Jorge Cuellar, Tom Maibaum, Program Chairs
