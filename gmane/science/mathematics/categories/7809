Dear Eduardo,

Your statement is valid internally in SS, that is once formalized in the
internal language of the topos SS; this can be done in geometric logic, =
by
considering a (possibly infinitary) disjunction over all the arrows f: C
---> X for C in CC (interpreted by the arrows Ff in SS) and existential
quantifications. If you want a statement valid 'externally', you should
instead use generalized elements in SS and epimorphic families involving
their domains.

I hope this helps.

Best regards,
Olivia  =20
