Dear Michael,

Still some content in Steve's claim could be imagined. A working
mathematician (WM) works with Borubaki's structures like groups or
vector spaces and leaves all worries about what his proofs actually
mean for a working math logician.  For such a WM, sketches (as any
other syntactical machineries) are indeed technical minutiae rather
than mathematical objects. It'd be perhaps a reasonable view unless a
bunch of strong semantic results (Tarski, Mal'cev,Robinson) that our
WM values so much, which are provided by bringing syntax onto the
stage.
