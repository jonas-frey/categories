******************** Call for Participation *************************

                      TWENTY YEARS OF DEEP INFERENCE

                           Oxford, July 7, 2018

                             Part of FLoC 2018

        <https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~lutz/orgs/TYDI2018.html>

*********************************************************************

Aim and Scope:
--------------

Deep inference is a paradigm for designing deductive proof
systems. The inference rules in such systems can perform arbitrary
rewriting inside formulas. This is very different from what one would
expect from more traditional formalisms, like sequent calculus or
natural deduction, where formulas are always decomposed along their
main connective.

The purpose of this workshop is to

- bring together researchers in the area of deep inference to exchange
    ideas and to discuss their current work, and

- present this vast growing field in a coherent, easy accessible way
    to other communities in all areas of logic in computer science. In
    particular, there will be a gentle introduction to deep inference
    given by Willem Heijltjes (University of Bath).


Invited Talks:
--------------

Willem Heijltjes (University of Bath):
"An introduction to deep inference"

Alessio Guglielmi(University of Bath):
"Two Unifying Structural Principles"

Dominic Hughes (UC Berkeley):
"Some incoherent musings on deep inference and combinatorial proofs"

Anupam Das (University of Copenhagen):
"Proof complexity of deep inference: a survey"


Contributed Talks:
------------------

Joseph Paulus: "Deep-Inference Intersection Types"
Ross Horne: "Truely Concurrent Processes in the Calculus of Structures"
Elaine Pimentel: "Sequentialising nested systems"
Sonia Marin: "Nested sequents for modal logics and beyond"
Benjamin Ralph: "Deep Inference, Herbrand???s Theorem and Expansion Proofs"
