Hi John -

You might want to take a look at the paper by Robin Cockett and me
"Proof theory for full intuitionistic linear logic, bilinear logic, and mix
categories " in TAC Vol 3 No 5.

  ftp://ftp.tac.mta.ca/pub/tac/html/volumes/1997/n5/n5.ps

As for a general theory - there are plenty of examples, though I don't know
if anyone has really made a general theory of this notion of a categorical
doctrine, often referred to, and based on a paper of Kock and Reyes from the
70's.  But there are many examples (many in the papers  Robin and I have
written on linearly distributive categories and related structures - visit
my webpage if you're interested), which make clear how to go from the
internal logic of a category to the category and back.  I suggest also you
look at our "Introduction to  linear bicategories" (MSCS:10(2000)2 pp
165-203), also available on my webpage, for a higher dimensional approach.

 - all the best, Robert
