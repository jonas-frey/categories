PSSL 87 in Patras - Honouring A. Kock, on the occasion of his 70th birthd=
ay

The 87th Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will be held in Patras,
Greece, the weekend 22-23 March 2008. The meeting will have an extra
festive character, honouring Anders Kock on the occasion of his 70th
birthday. For that reason an extra session of invited talks will take
place on Friday 21 March.

A. Joyal, F.W. Lawvere and G. Reyes have accepted to participate in the
celebration with plenary talks. People who wish to attend may thus plan
for a longer stay than a usual PSSL would imply. The need for a longer
stay is propped by the fact that Patras is, for most people in the
community, a more remote destination than those in central and western
Europe where Peripatetic Seminars were previously held. Please take also
into account that the weekend 22-23 March is that of the Catholic Easter
(not of the Greek Orthodox one though).

Travelling information, possible arrangements for transportation from
Athens airport and further details will appear in the webpage
