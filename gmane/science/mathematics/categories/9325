Dear Peter,

Would you (or others on the list) happen to have an electronic copy of
"On canonizing category theory or on functorializing model theory"? A
document such as this (even cited in the Elephant!) should be more
widely available, I think. Even if subsumed by Categories, Allegories
it is of historical interest.

Thanks,

David
