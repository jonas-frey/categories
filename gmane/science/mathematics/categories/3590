		   Research Fellow/Postdoc position
		in Category Theory, Logic and Computation,
			 University of Ottawa

The Logic Group in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the
University of Ottawa is looking to hire at least one
research fellow/postdoc beginning in September, 2007.

The positions are in any area of category theory, categorical
logic, and theoretical computer science.

Research fellows / postdocs will participate in the activities of
the Logic and Foundations of Computation Group. This group includes
faculty and students from several different Ottawa-area
universities. In the Math Department, the Logic Group currently
includes 4 faculty members (R. Blute, P. Hofstra, P.E. Parent and P. Scott),
as well as a number of postdocs and graduate students.
For more information about our team, see
http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~phil/lfc/.

The research fellowships/postdocs are initially for one year, with a
possible renewal for a second year. Duties include research and the
teaching of two one-semester courses. Potential applicants should contact
one of us:


 Richard Blute  (rblute at uottawa.ca)
 Pieter Hofstra (phofstra at uottawa.ca)
 Paul-Eugene Parent (pparent at uottawa.ca)
 Philip Scott  (phil at site.uottawa.ca)

immediately by email to indicate their interest. They should then also
send a curriculum vitae, a research plan, and arrange for three
confidential letters of recommendation, with one addressing teaching,
to be sent to Professor Victor Leblanc, Chairman, Department of
Mathematics and Statistics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON Canada,
K1N 6N5. Applicants are also encouraged to include up to three copies
of their most significant publications.

Those who have already applied for a position will
of course be considered and do not have to re-send an application,
although it would be wise to send one of us an email.
