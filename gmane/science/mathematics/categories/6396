Dear Colin=2CI think your stronger definition is the correct one=2C by anal=
ogy withother categories (where properness and other manifestations ofinten=
sive and extensive objective quantities come up).  If your definition of 'c=
ategory' itself is equivalent to 'internal category  C3=3D>C2->C1 x C1 in t=
he category of classes '=2C then your notion seems to be a case of the cond=
ition (on E ->B) that the pullback of any small S ->B is small.The AXIOM of=
  replacement would perhaps be the extra condition on the universe that the =
pullbacks of S =3D 1 suffice to test the above=2C a condition that is perha=
ps appropriate for abstract constant discrete sets but not for cohesive var=
iable ones.It would not be the 'scheme' of replacement that is relevant her=
e since the category of objective classes (not their sometimes representing=
  subjective formulas) is directly under consideration.I presume that you ar=
e here trying to extend the Bernays-Mac Lane framework.It is not clear what=
  would result if we alternatively considered that a category C itself is ju=
st a formula=2C i.e objectively=2C a subset naturally defined in every mode=
