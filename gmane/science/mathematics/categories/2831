I attended the Bowdoin Summer Seminar as a 2nd year math grad student with
some training in math logic and none in category theory. MacLane gave the
principal lectures (later developed into his CWM) and others (Eilenberg,
Isbell) weighed in with lectures on special topics.  A few points stick in
memory. For instance, Eilenberg lectured on his categorical treatment of
abstract machine theory. At one point he was analyzing the words generated
by a set of symbols A, and he derived that I+A+A^2+... = [I-A]^-1 with such
flourish that a spontaneous applause broke out in the audience. Otherwise,
Eilenberg along with Lawvere and Tierney played poker and smoked cigars with
great relish. In one lecture on some of Linton's results, MacLane presented
a picture of an Australian road sign for the town of "Colinton" which
MacLane said was named after Linton's antipodal dual. Foreign (i.e.,
non-North-American) category theorists were represented by (at least)
Eduardo Dubuc and Sabah Fakir. I don't know about "Phreilambud" but I
suspect the "bud" is from Eisenbud who mentions in his Preface to MacLane's
mathematical autobiography that Bowdoin was the only time he saw "Saunders
and Sammy" together and that all gathered around when they discussed the
origins of the subject one evening after dinner.

These were early days in the so-called 'foundations' debate with set theory
where the latter was represented at Bowdoin by Feferman. I suspect that many
of the arguments expressed in Feferman's 1977 article (which Colin recently
described as "the most sustained critique of categorical foundations to
date" [Phil. Math. 2005]) were hammered out at Bowdoin.

The last session of the seminar was called the "prayer meeting" where
various people were asked to "let their hair down" and talk informally about
the future of CT and foundations. I was the symbolic grad student asked to
say a few words and I was so nervous I don't remember what the others said!
I made a few (certainly elementary and perhaps incoherent) remarks on the
difference between sets as (non-self-participating) universals for a
property in contrast with the (self-participating) universals (UMPs) of CT
which in some sense exemplify the property they represent (ideas developed
years later in an article on "concrete universals" and CT in Erkenntnis
1988).

The final social event was a feast of Maine lobsters at a nearby beach
presided over by MacLane and Dorothy. As we were devouring our lobsters, I
particularly remember MacLane shouting out to all assembled: "Don't eat the
green stuff, don't eat the green stuff!" (a reference to lower part of the
lobster's alimentary canal).
