 From teaching first year analysis I saw  that we need rules for
constructing continuous (and then differentiable) functions (as the
texts do, of course).
I guess this led me later to emphasise constructions of continuous
functions in topology, and this leads naturally in many cases to
universal properties. (Are categorical methods relevant to functions of
bounded variation?) This is the conceptual revolution in which of course
a particular construction is defined by its relation to all other
objects of the `category of discourse'. This can be related to
programming; given any input of the required type, the output is a
function or morphism. It also emphasises properties rather than mode of
construction.

So categorical methods can be used without explicitly saying at the
first instance that one is doing `category theory'; I was also an
advocate of set notation
in calculus, for example to name the domains of functions defined by
formulae, without introducing `set theory' as a `big deal'.
