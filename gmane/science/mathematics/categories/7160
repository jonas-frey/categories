-- HOST CITY --

Tallinn, a city of 412,000 people, is the capital and largest city of
Estonia, a small EU member country in Northern Europe, bordering
Russia to the East and Latvia to the south. Located in the north of
the country, on the southern shores of the Gulf of Finland, opposite
Helsinki in Finland, Tallinn is most well known for its picturesque
medieval Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site. But it also has a
vivid cultural scene, outperforming most European centres of similar
size. In 2011, Tallinn, along with Turku in Finland, was the Cultural
Capital of Europe.

Tallinn is easy to travel to. Estonia is part of Schengen and the
Eurozone. The Lennart Meri International Airport of Tallinn (TLL) is
only 4 kms from the city centre.

     * Workshops chair: Keiko Nakata
     * Organizing committee: James Chapman, Juhan Ernits, Tiina Laasma,
