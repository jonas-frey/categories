Of course Tarski's axiomatization had precursors going all the way back to
Euclid, and as is discussed in the Tarski and Givant paper none of his axioms
are new with Tarski.  There is some discussion of the actual development of
Euclidean geometry from the axioms in that article, but I believe (though I do
not actually have the book) the detailed development was presented in

Schwabhauser, W. and Szmielew, W. and Tarski, A.,
Metamathematische Methoden in der Geometrie,
Springer-Verlag, 1983

But the development is in showing how to go from the axioms to analytic
geometry not in developing a direct extension of Euclid's methods.
