About PPDP
----------

The PPDP 2019 symposium brings together researchers from the declarative
programming communities, including those working in the functional,
logic, answer-set, and constraint handling programming paradigms. The
goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and
methods for analyzing, performing, specifying, and reasoning about
computations, including mechanisms for concurrency, security, static
analysis, and verification.


Invited Speakers
----------------

Amal Ahmed                      Northeastern University, USA
Naoki Kobayashi                 The University of Tokyo, Japan

Scope
-----

Submissions are invited on all topics related to declarative
programming, from principles to practice, from foundations to
applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to

-   Language Design: domain-specific languages; interoperability;
     concurrency, parallelism, and distribution; modules;
     probabilistic languages; reactive languages; database languages;
     knowledge representation languages; languages with objects;
     language extensions for tabulation; metaprogramming.

-   Implementations: abstract machines; interpreters; compilation;
     compile-time and run-time optimization; memory management.

-   Foundations: types; logical frameworks; monads and effects;
     semantics.

-   Analysis and Transformation: partial evaluation;
     abstract interpretation; control flow; data flow; information flow;
     termination analysis; resource analysis; type inference and type
     checking; verification; validation; debugging; testing.

-   Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments;
     verification tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive
     theorem provers; certification; novel applications of declarative
     programming inside and outside of CS; declarative programming
     pearls; practical experience reports and industrial application;
     education.

The PC chair (Ekaterina Komendanstkaya <e.komendantskaya@hw.ac.uk>)
will be happy to advise on the appropriateness of a topic.

Submission Categories
---------------------

Submissions can be made in three categories: regular Research Papers,
System Descriptions, and Experience Reports.

Submissions of Research Papers must present original research which is
unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 12 pages
ACM style 2-column (including figures, but excluding bibliography).
Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published
workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in
case of questions). Research papers will be judged on originality,
significance, correctness, clarity, and readability.

Submission of System Descriptions must describe a working system whose
description has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must
not exceed 10 pages and should contain a link to a working system.
System Descriptions must be marked as such at the time of submission
and will be judged on originality, significance, usefulness, clarity,
and readability.

Submissions of Experience Reports are meant to help create a body of
published, refereed, citable evidence where declarative programming
such as functional, logic, answer-set, constraint programming, etc.,
is used in practice. They must not exceed 5 pages **including
references**.  Experience Reports must be marked as such at the time
of submission and need not report original research results. They will
be judged on significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.

Supplementary material may be provided in a clearly marked appendix
beyond the above-mentioned page limits. Reviewers are not required to
study any material beyond the respective page limit.

Format of a Submission
----------------------

For each paper category, you must use the most recent version of the
"Current ACM Master Template" which is available at
<https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>. The most
recent version at the time of writing is 1.48. You must use the LaTeX
sigconf proceedings template as the conference organizers are unable
to process final submissions in other formats. In case of problems
with the templates, contact ACM's TeX support team at Aptara
<acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com>.

Authors should note ACM's statement on author's rights
(http://authors.acm.org/) which apply to final papers. Submitted
papers should meet the requirements of ACM's plagiarism policy
(http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy).

Requirements for Publication
----------------------------

At least one author of each accepted submission will be expected to
attend and present the work at the conference. The pc chair may retract
a paper that is not presented. The pc chair may also retract a paper if
complaints about the paper's correctness are raised which cannot be
resolved by the final paper deadline.
