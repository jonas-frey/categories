For sheaves on a finite site (which by a theorem of AGV in SGA4 vol 2 is th=
e same as all presheaves on some smaller finite category C)=2C take the cat=
egory of all functors from C^op to bold 2. It is a finite poset=2C in fact=
=2C a Heyting algebra (indeed even  bi-Heyting) belying the old misconcepti=
on that one deviates from Boole only for infinite sets. If for each given A=
  in C we do the same for C/A=2C we get the figures of shape A in the Omega =
of the topos. The adjoints to maps induced by A'->A give a concrete model o=
f tense logic.
By the same AGV (not only these C/A' ->C/A but) any functor between finite =
categories induces a geometric morphism that is even "essential".
Actually=2C taking sheaves valued in the topos of finite sets would be inte=
resting=2C providing a more objective version of number theorythan the abst=
ract exponential rig traditionally called "natural".
Topos theory is bristling with potential examples that we "generalists" hav=
e been slow to take up.
Anyway=2C the above construction of Omega is manifestly exponential=2C henc=
e an effort to find computable sub cases is clearly needed=2C as you sugges=
