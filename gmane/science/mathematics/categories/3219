Marta Bunge wrote (inter alia):

It was the confluence of ideas and people working in harmony that
was so wonderful in those days. Why should they be gone forever?  Let us
work together to bring them back, if possible.

A consummation devoutly to be wished.  In algebraic topology, throughout
my career, there has been most of the time such harmony and a
willingness to acknowledge each ohters work.  Only briefly have there
been periods of `turf claiming' and antagonism between individuals if
not `camps'. (Of course funding was plentiful in my early days.)

	Should it not be sufficient to acknowledge good work who ever
produces it?
