	   PRELIMINARY PROGRAMME and CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


CTCS'97 is the 7th conference on Category Theory and Computer Science.
 The purpose of the conference series is the advancement of the
 foundations of computing using the tools of category theory, algebra,
 geometry and logic. While the emphasis is upon applications of
 category theory, it is recognized that the area is highly
 interdisciplinary.  The proceedings will be published by Springer in
 the LNCS series.  The conference is sponsored by GNIM (Gruppo
 Nazionale Informatica Matematica) of CNR and Universita' di Genova.

LOCATION
 The conference will take place at Hotel Regina Elena, a 4 stars hotel
 with private beach, located in S. Margherita Ligure. S. Margherita is
 a beautiful sea resort in Liguria very close to Portofino promontory
 and about 30 km east of Genova.
