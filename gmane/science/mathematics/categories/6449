The Fifth International Conference on Topology, Algebra and Categories
in Logic is dedicated to the memory of Leo Esakia (1934-2010).


Scope
-----
Studying logics via semantics is a well-established and very active
branch of mathematical logic, with many applications, in computer
science and elsewhere. The area is characterized by results, tools
and techniques stemming from various fields, including universal
algebra, topology, category theory, order, and model theory. The
program of the conference TACL 2011 will focus on three
interconnecting mathematical themes central to the semantical study
of logics and their applications: algebraic, categorical, and
topological methods. This is the fifth conference in the series
Topology, Algebra and Categories in Logic (TACL, formerly TANCL).
Earlier installments of this conference have been organized in
Tbilisi (2003), Barcelona (2005), Oxford (2007), Amsterdam (2009).


Featured topics
---------------

Contributed talks can deal with any topic dealing with the use of
algebraic, categorical or topological methods in either logic or
computer science. This includes, but is not limited to, the following
areas:

* Algebraic structures in CS
* Algebraic logic
* Coalgebra
* Categorical methods in logic
* Domain theory
* Fuzzy and many-valued logics
* Lattice theory
* Lattices with operators
* Modal logics
* Non-classical logics
* Ordered topological spaces
* Ordered algebraic structures
* Pointfree topology
* Proofs and Types
* Residuated structures
* Semantics
* Stone-type dualities
* Substructural logics
* Topological semantics of modal logic


Submissions
-----------
Contributed presentations will be of two types:
o 20 minutes long presentations in parallel sessions and
o featured, 30 minutes long, plenary presentations.
The submission of an abstract will be required to be selected for
a contributed presentation of either kind. While preference will
be given to new work, results that have already been published or
presented elsewhere will also be considered.

More information on the submission procedure will be made available soon.


Important dates
---------------
April 18, 2011: Abstract submission deadline
May 20, 2011:   Notification to authors
July 26-30, 2011:  Conference
