This may be true for Bourbaki structures, but there have been several
discussions at the forum associated to the nLab as to how to single
out the 'correct' notion of *isomorphism* for even something as
prosaic as Banach spaces! (Let alone what the general morphisms should
be in a category of such) There may be an obvious definition of an
isomorphism, preserving all the structure, but this is not the one
that Banach space theorists usually use, though they are aware of it.

Best,

David
