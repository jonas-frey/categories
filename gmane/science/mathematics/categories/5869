TeX provides a command \doteq for an equality sign with a dot over it;
this is used in other areas of mathematics to mean "is approximately
equal to", but as far as I know it hasn't yet been used by=20
category-theorists. Perhaps we could use it to mean "is canonically
isomorphic to"?

I'd also like to use it (or something like it) between pairs of
morphisms, meaning that (they are not equal but) they become equal
when composed with the appropriate canonical isomorphisms (to which
I can't be bothered to give names) in order to match up their domains
and codomains. (Of course, this is simply saying that they are
canonically isomorphic as objects of the functor category [2,C],
where C is the category in which they live.)
