			  First Announcement

              Foundations of Wide Area Network Programming
              ============================================
 
       13th International School for Computer Science Researchers
                    Lipari Island, July 1-14, 2001


 The 13th School for Computer Science Researchers addresses Ph.D. 
 students and young researchers who want to get exposed to the
 forefront of research activity in the field of Wide Area Network
 Programming, with particular reference to the future of the World
 Wide Web and to issues of distributed architectures, software
 engineering, object oriented design, security, mobility,
 coordination, collaborative work and retrieval/handling of
 semistructured data.

 The school will be held in the beautiful surroundings of the island
 of Lipari. Participants will be arranged in a comfortable hotel at
 very special rates. The conference room (in the same hotel) is air
 conditioned and equipped with all conference materials. Special areas
 are reserved to students for the afternoon coursework and study. A
 proficiency final exam at the end of each chosen course is mandatory
 for students. A social tour to Stromboli with spectacular vulcano
 fireworks will be held on Sunday, July 8.

 The official language is English.

 The island of Lipari can be easily reached from Milazzo, Palermo,
 Naples, Messina and Reggio Calabria by ferry or hydrofoil (50 minutes
 from Milazzo). The organization provides a round-trip bus from
 Catania airport (the third most important airport in Italy) to
 Milazzo hydrofoil terminal and viceversa.
