Dear Vasili,

I'm not sure how much this will answer your questions, but there was
some research towards the end of the last century relating databases and
 powerdomains. In a sense, then, the associated logic of database
queries is that of the open sets of the domain, i.e. geometric logic,
and hence (at least in its finitary form) a fragment of intuitionistic
logic. The names I associate with this work are Carl Gunter and Peter
Buneman. I wrote a 1992 paper "Geometric Theories and Databases" that
was inspired by them, though its main content was a topos-theoretic
construction.

Regards,

Steve Vickers.
