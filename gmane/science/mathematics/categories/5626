               Proof Systems for Program Logics (PSPL 2010)
                  Saturday 10th July 2010, Edinburgh, UK

               A LICS 2010-affiliated workshop at FLoC 2010
                http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/als/PSPL2010/

A new workshop bringing together researchers working on any aspect of
the design, study and application of proof systems for program logics.

Invited speakers: Andre Platzer    (Carnegie Mellon University)
                   Viktor Vafeiadis (University of Cambridge)


CALL FOR CONTRIBUTED TALKS

The emphasis of the workshop is on reporting current and ongoing research.

30-minute contributed talks will be selected on the basis of
two-page abstracts.

Submission deadline for two-page abstracts: Monday 12th April 2010.
Author notification                       : Monday 26th April 2010.

Possible topics include, but are not restricted to:

          * Proof systems for modular/compositional verification
          * Proof systems for substructural/spatial/nominal logics
          * Proof systems for concurrent/mobile/distributed systems
          * Proof systems for timed/continuous/probabilistic/stochastic/hybr=
id
            systems
          * Structural proof theory (e.g. natural deduction and sequent
            calculus systems) for program logics
          * Proof-theoretic mechanisms for induction/coinduction/fixed point=
s
          * Proof systems formalizing operational semantics
          * Proof systems for program synthesis
          * Constructive type theories and logics for verification/synthesis
          * Curry-Howard and generalisations to non-functional computation
          * Proof-theoretic accounts of decidability/complexity results
          * Completeness and relative completeness proofs for program logics
          * Proof systems designed to facilitate proof search

Abstracts will appear in the FLoC Workhops electronic proceedings.
It is planned to follow the workshop with a journal special issue.
