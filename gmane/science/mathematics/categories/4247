There's still something odd about this question. Requiring the subcategory
to contain all endomorphisms of M of course requires it to contain
A(M,M) as a monoid. But if you don't require it to be closed under
biproducts in A, then presumably you don't require it to contain A(M,M)
as a ring. It therefore raises two questions of "pure algebra":

What conditions on a monoid (with 0) are needed to ensure that it occurs
as the multiplicative monoid of a ring?

Given that it does so occur, can there be several different additive
group structures making it into a ring?

I suspect that a fair amount must be known about these questions, but
the only result I know in this area is one which I quoted in "Stone
Spaces": for a ring of the form C(X), X a compact Hausdorff space,
the multiplicative monoid structure of C(X) is enough to determine
the topology of X (and hence the ring structure of C(X)) uniquely.
