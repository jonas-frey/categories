This book is being published:

Marco Grandis
Category Theory and Applications, A Textbook for Beginners
World Scientific, March 2018

=46rom the preface
"Category Theory now permeates most of Mathematics, large parts of =
theoretical Computer Science and parts of theoretical Physics. Its =
unifying power brings together different branches, and leads to a deeper =
understanding of their roots.
This book is addressed to students and researchers of these fields and =
can be used as a text for a first course in Category Theory. It covers =
its basic tools, like universal properties, limits, adjoint functors and =
monads. These are presented in a concrete way, starting from examples =
and exercises taken from elementary Algebra, Lattice Theory and =
Topology, then developing the theory together with new exercises and =
applications.
Applications of Category Theory form a vast and differentiated domain. =
This book wants to present the basic applications and a choice of more =
advanced ones, based on the interests of the author. References are =
given for applications in many other fields."
