    Lambda Definability with Sums via Grothendieck Logical Relations

                 by Marcelo Fiore and Alex Simpson

    We introduce a notion of *Grothendieck logical relation* and use 
    it to characterise the definability of morphisms in *stable* bicartesian
    closed categories by terms of the simply-typed lambda calculus with 
    finite products and finite sums. Our techniques are based on concepts 
    from topos theory, however our exposition is elementary.


The paper is written in a style appropriate for the conference

    Typed Lambda-Calculi and Applications

where it is to be presented in April. However, we briefly discuss
the true categorical content of the paper, which will be further 
expanded upon in a full version of the paper (forthcoming).

The paper is available over the Web:
