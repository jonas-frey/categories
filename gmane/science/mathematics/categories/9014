Dear All,=0A=
=0A=
The distance between the notion of elementary "topos"=0A=
and the notion of space is particularly striking with Hyland's effective "t=
opos". =0A=
The effective "topos" is inspired by constructive set theory (Kleene recurs=
ive realizability)=0A=
and it is among the important constructions in the theory of elementary "to=
poses".=0A=
But it has no effect on topology! (ask your favorite topologist).=0A=
We should probably stop saying that the theory of elementary "topos" (gener=
alised) is topology!=0A=
It appears to be more a branch of higher order logic formulated in the lang=
uage of category theory. =0A=
We can hope that the theory of  elementary "toposes" will eventually find =
=0A=
applications to topology (something recognised by topologist). The fact tha=
t a  (Grothendieck) topos E=0A=
over a base (Grothendieck) topos S can be regarded as a  (Grothendieck) top=
os =0A=
internal to the set theory defined by S could play a role. =0A=
=0A=
Homotopy type theory is a new avenue for the applications  of higher order =
logic to topology. =0A=
But the notion of elementary higher "topos" has not yet been formalised pre=
cisely.=0A=
=0A=
Best regards,=0A=

The very notion of Grothendieck topos involves in fact two topos=0A=
(sheaves over a site on the base). That is, it is a notion of geometric=0A=
morphism, it does not make sense as a single category.=0A=
=0A=
The notion of elementary topos is a completely different notion which=0A=
involves a single topos, it does perfect sense as a single category.=0A=
=0A=
This observation was made to me by Jacques Penon about 36 years ago.=0A=
=0A=
I agree with Joyal that the two notions should be kept apart. Not doing=0A=
so has created a lot of confusion.=0A=
