In section 2.3.1 of

"Higher Topos Theory"
http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608040

Jacob Lurie motivates the notion of "inner fibrations" and of
Cartesian fibrations of (oo,1)-categories as a generalization of this
"pasting" construction.

"Pasting" along any bifunctor C^op x D --> Set is the same as having
an inner fibration over the interval (which is an arbitrary functor
for 1-categories), and the particular "pasting" that you mention, over
hom_D(F(-),-) coming from a functor F : C \to D, gives a Cartesian
fibration over the interval (top of p. 88, leading over to section
2.4).

Best,
