Dear all,

The 15th Wessex theory seminar will take place on Thursday 19 July at
the University of Birmingham.

The Wessex Theory Seminars are a series of workshops focused on
theoretical computer science, and in particular mathematical foundations
of programming languages. It is designed to be a joint seminar
of Mathematics and Computer Science departments, and industrial
collaborators.

As you can see from the preliminary programme, the talks include proof
theory, category theory, semantics, automata, security, complexity and
logic.  Truly something for everybody if not quite a few things.

If you plan to attend please reply to this message so I can put you on
the attendance list. As usual there is funding available to reimburse
travel expenses etc.

Further information, including abstracts, can be found at the website:

regards,
Paul
