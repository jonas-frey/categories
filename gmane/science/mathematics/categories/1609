Homotopies and automorphisms of crossed modules of groupoids
ABSTRACT: We give a detailed description of the structure of the actor
2-crossed module related to the automorphisms of a crossed module of
groupoids. This generalises work of Brown and Gilbert for the case of
crossed modules of groups, and part of this is needed for work on
2-dimensional holonomy to be developed elsewhere.

Local subgroupoids II: Examples and properties
ABSTRACT: The notion of local subgroupoid as a generalisation of a local
equivalence relation was defined in a previous paper by the first two
authors. Here we use the notion of star path connectivity for a Lie
groupoid to give an important new class of examples, generalising the local
equivalence relation of a foliation, and develop in this new context basic
properties of coherence, due earlier to Rosenthal in the special case.
These results are required for further applications to holonomy and
monodromy.
