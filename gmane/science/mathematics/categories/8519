Abstract=0A=
=0A=
A theorem of A.M.Pitts (1986) states that essential surjections of=0A=
toposes bounded over a base topos S are of effective lax descent. The=0A=
symmetric monad M on the 2-category of toposes bounded over S is a=0A=
KZ-monad (Bunge-Carboni 1995) and the M-maps are precisely the=0A=
S-essential geometric morphisms (Bunge-Funk 2006). These last two=0A=
results led me to conjecture and then prove the general lax descent=0A=
theorem that is the subject matter of this paper. By a 'Pitts KZ-monad'=0A=
on a 2-category K it is meant here a locally fully faithful equivariant=0A=
KZ-monad M on K that is required to satisfy an analogue of Pitts'=0A=
theorem on bicomma squares along essential geometric morphisms. The main=0A=
result of this paper states that=2C for a Pitts KZ-monad M on a=0A=
2-category K ('of spaces')=2C every surjective M-map is of effective lax=0A=
descent. There is a dual version of this theorem for a Pitts co-KZ-monad=0A=
  N. These theorems have (known and new) consequences regarding (lax)=0A=
descent for morphisms of toposes and locales.=0A=
