Thanks, Simon.

So it seems that, however one wishes to prove it (and in fact there are
many ways), my original answer was correct. I subsequently tried to
correct my original answer, but in fact it turns out that I corrected it
to something else which was correct. Indeed, if:

- X is the category of f.g. free G^op-sets (for G a group or a groupoid)
- Y is the subcategory of X on the well-supported objects

then [Y, Set], my first answer, is equivalent to Sh(X^op), my second
answer, and both classify the notion of inhabited free right G-set.
Here on the right we are taking sheaves for the topology on X^op
comprising the project projections. The point is that:

- every object of X is covered by one of Y;
- if A is in Y, then the sieve in X generated by any product projection
BxA-->A is easily seen to be the maximal one

whence by the comparison lemma, sheaves on X^op are the same as
presheaves on Y^op.
