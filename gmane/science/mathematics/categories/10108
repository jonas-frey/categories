Please distribute to undergraduate and master's students and appropriate
counsellors and supervisors.

Note that we have a large group of faculty, postdocs and graduate
students with interests involving (higher) category theory.

The February 1st deadline is very close, so apply soon, but also note
that applications will continue to be reviewed past the deadline as
space permits.
