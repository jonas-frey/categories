I don't know about this.  I took several courses in the late 1950s that
seem to have been influenced by the structuralist ideas (certainly
categories weren't mentioned; I never heard the word until Dave Harrison
arrived in 1959) and each of them started by defining an appropriate
notion of "admissible map".  I do not recall any special point being made
of isomorphism and I think in general it was used for what we now call a
bimorphism (1-1 and onto) even in cases, such as topological groups, when
they were not isomorphisms.

To be sure Bourbaki was not mentioned either, but this structuralist
influence seemed strong.
