When I was an editor for an Elsevier-edited journal -
before I decided they were so nasty I should resign -
I discovered how this works.

They're scared to death that people will switch to free electronic
journals.  But, they don't want to openly cave in and institute a
universal policy of letting authors keep the copyrights to their
work.   So, they cut a deal with anyone who pressures them, but
don't advertise this.
