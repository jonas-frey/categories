Dear Mike,

I don't have an answer for this precise question, but, assuming I
understand your question, I do have a reference for a general approach
that can provide a potential lower bound on the number of such
operations.

Take a look at "Homological Computations for Term Rewriting Systems"
by Philippe Malbos and Samuel Mimram:
http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~malbos/Art/hcTRS.pdf

It uses some rather heavyweight abstract homology theory but produces
a purely mechanical procedure for obtaining results (though the
authors to my knowledge haven't yet implemented a computer program to
perform this automatically).

Cheers,
Gershom
