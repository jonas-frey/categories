				CALL FOR PAPERS

				   OOSDS'99
				   
	Workshop on Object-Oriented Specification Techniques
	        for Distributed Systems and Behaviours

		Paris, France, September 27, 1999
	http://www.tec.informatik.uni-rostock.de/IuK/congr/oosds99/
	
================================================================================

SCOPE OF WORKSHOP:
=================
The workshop is focused on specification languages for distributed 
systems which are extensions of object-oriented languages or have an 
object-oriented kind of base structure. The aim is to bring together
researchers interested in incorporating object-oriented concepts 
and  formal methods for specification of distributed systems and
behaviours. 

TOPICS (NOT EXCLUSIVE LIST):
============================
Object-oriented approaches to specification of distributed systems 
and behaviours.

Semantic models for concurrency and object-orientation (e.g. based on the 
lambda-calculus, process algebra, pi-calculus, linear logic).

Characteristic examples of object-oriented specification from real 
application domains (e.g. distributed algorithms, workflow specification, 
communication protocols).

Logic reasoning on distributed systems and behaviours.

SUBMISSION:
===========
The deadline for submission is September 14, 1999. 
Submission is in electronic form only.
Submission may be of two forms:
	Extended abstracts: up to 3 pages.
	Papers and reports: up to 6 pages.
In both cases a separate page with the following information: title, author(s), 
corresponding author, contact information and a 12-15 lines summary 
should be included.
The papers and/or abstracts should be sent by e-mail to 
ustin@informatik.uni-rostock.de.

PUBLICATION:
============
Selected submissions will be published in a refereed journal after the workshop.
The others will be published electronically. 

RELATED EVENTS:
==============
This workshop is organized as a satellite workshop of PPDP'99, 
The 1999 International Conference on  Principles and Practice 
of Declarative Programming, Paris, France, September 29-October 1, 1999 
http://www.dmi.ens.fr/~fages/PPDP99/

=======================
Clemens H. Cap  (Rostock University, Germany) 
Natalia Ioustinova  (Rostock University, Germany) 
Javier Oliver  (Technical University of Valencia, Spain) 
Nobuko Yoshida  (University of Sussex, UK)
