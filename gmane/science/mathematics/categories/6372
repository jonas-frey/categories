  CALL FOR PAPERS

  Journal LOGICA UNIVERSALIS invites authors to submit papers for a
  SPECIAL ISSUE on CATEGORICAL LOGIC that will be published in 2011.

>>>>>The deadline for the submission is 1st JANUARY 2011.  <<<< Deadline EX=
TENSION

  Guest Editors of this Special Issue: Valeria Paiva (University of Birmingh=
am)
  and Andrei Rodin (University Paris-Diderot).

  Categorical logic is a branch of Category theory (in mathematics),
  strongly connected to both =A0mathematical logic and =A0theoretical
  computer science. In broad terms, categorical logic represents both
  syntax and semantics of a logic by a category, and an interpretation
  by a functor. The categorical framework provides a rich conceptual
  background for logical and type-theoretic constructions. The subject
  has been recognizable in these terms since around 1970, given the work
  of pioneers like Joyal, Lawvere, Lambek, Makkai, Martin-Loeuf, Scott
  and many others.

  Topics that =A0fit this Special Issue include, but are not limited to,
  the following:

  - Relationships between logic and geometry in a topos-theoretic setting;
  - Categorical logic and Categorical foundations of mathematics;
  - Sketch theory and diagrammatic syntax;
  - Functorial semantics and Categorical Model theory;
  - Quantum logic categorically;
  - Extensions of categorical semantics to different kinds of logics
    such as modal and substructural logics;
  - Comparison of different categorical frameworks

  Submissions should be made electronically to one or both of the
  Guest Editors: Valeria Paiva( valeria.depaiva@gmail.com ) or Andrei Rodin
  (rodin@ens.fr).
