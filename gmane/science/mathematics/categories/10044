Hey all

Suppose that we have a category A. If we want to formally add a single morp=
hism, say f:X -> Y, where X,Y are in A, but f is not in A, we can do the fo=
llowing: we look at the discrete category containing  only X and Y - let us=
  denote that as (X   Y) - and the category with two objects and only a sing=
le morphism between them. Let's call this one (X -> Y).

There are natural embeddings (X   Y) -> A and (X    Y) -> (X -> Y). We take=
  the pushout of these functors, and as one might expect, we get the union o=
f A and (X -> Y). This is basically A, but with an extra morphism formally =
added in. Let's call this new morphism f and the new category A_f. This cat=
egory is not particularly interesting, but I can then quotient it by some e=
quations involving f and it becomes more interesting.

I don't think that I am doing anything particularly modern, and I expect th=
at someone else will have done something similar in the past, but my search=
  has not been very fruitful. Does anyone have any references that they can =
throw my way?

Thanks
Joe
