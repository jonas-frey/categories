                                     Post-Proceedings of TYPES 2009



The Post-Proceedings of the TYPES 2009 Annual Workshop

http://lama.univ-savoie.fr/types09/

will be published, after a formal referee process, as a volume of the
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) series

http://eptcs.org/ .

Submissions are not restricted to works presented at the workshop, nor
are authors expected to be formally involved in the Types project.

Deadlines
   - abstract submission:  Wednesday, May 19th, 2010, 12:00 Paris time,
   - paper submission:  Wednesday, May 26th, 2010, 12:00 Paris time.

We encourage submissions on the themes of the Types Project

http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/Types/ .

The aim of Types is to develop the technology of formal reasoning and
computer programming based on Type Theory. This is done by improving
the languages and computerised tools for reasoning, and by applying
the technology in several domains such as analysis of programming
languages, certified software, formalisation of mathematics and
mathematics education.

We invite submission of high quality papers, written in English and
typeset in LaTeX2e using the EPTCS style:

http://style.eptcs.org/ .

Submissions should not have been published and should not be under
consideration for publication elsewhere. We encourage authors to keep
their submissions below 30 pages. Authors should submit their papers
electronically to Tom Hirschowitz.

The guest editors,

   Thorsten Altenkirch,
   Tom Hirshowitz,
   Christophe Raffalli, and
   Alan Schmitt.
