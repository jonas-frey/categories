Over the years, author Julie Rehmeyer has given birth to quite a litter,

http://www.sciencenews.org/view/authored/id/43/name/Julie_Rehmeyer ,

of mathematically literate news articles, including, for example, a repor=

The piece you point to strikes me as quite reasonable, actually, apart fr=
om =

the two pairs of paragraphs reporting on the ... umm ... thinking (?) of
Messrs. Harper and Spivak, which strike me as being probably accurate
depictions of their own cockeyed cocktail-party gibberish.

[But then, what do I know? I'm just a retiree from tiny little Wesleyan, =

after all, not an active respected member of Carnegie Mellon or MIT :-) .=
]

But all the rest is about as close to the mark as a discussion pitched =

to the interested and sympathetic layperson can possibly be.

Cheers, and thanks for pointing that piece out, -- Fred
