A few gentle corrections, if I may, and a comment. =


First, a recurrent typo:

*never* "abuter" -- only "abouter".

Next, when I wrote

> French "abouter" is a verb, derived from "bout", whose meaning is
> 'to join (or to place) end to end'

I omitted what I (evidently incorrectly) thought went without saying;
better would have been to include it, so:

> 'to join (or to place) [two things] end to end'

(thus "abouter" can be used for the placement of two successive =

spans of a bridge, as in Vaughan's illustration, with the
special dedicated support where the two spans 'abut' being,
obviously, an 'abutment'; but one would not ["abouter" a path]).

And then, I omitted to mention that the verb "aboutir" is
*intransitive* -- it does *not* accept any direct object.
Thus it is linguistically impossible to ["aboutir" a path]: but
one *may* say of a path that it "aboutit" *at* a certain point,
or *in* a certain set, or ... .

[There is a reflexive cognate of "aboutir" -- "s'aboutir" -- used in
gardening terminology to mean 'to bud' or 'to be covered with buds',
but this usage surerely serves only as a red herring if one wants =

to understand "aboutir" proper.]

Finally, to make peace with Jim S and Mike B: I in no way intend
what I've written (initially just privately, first to Mike, and =

then to Eduardo) to dictate new terminology in place of established =

spectral sequence usage. And I very much appreciate Jim's having shared =

his mental 'abutting' vision for that usage. And yet, remembering the
triples/monads transition, I wonder whether a similar transition
may not yet take place as regards "aboutissement", etc.

Cheers, -- Fred

[PS: As not all mail-readers render what are known as HTML named entities=
 =

correctly, let me just add that, where a reader may see an 'agrave' betwe=
en
an ampersand and a semicolon, I had intended an "a" with 'accent grave';
my similarly placed 'eacute' was meant to show as "e" with 'acute accent'=
=2E
Apologies to all those whose mail-readers garble these. -- Fred]
