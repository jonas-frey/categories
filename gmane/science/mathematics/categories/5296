Dear Claudio,

my immediate response, like yours, was that this couldn't be true.

But in the case of distributivity, rather to my surprise, it turns out to be
true: any category with finite products and coproducts and a natural family
of isomorphisms XY+XZ~X(Y+Z) is in fact distributive.

The proof, unfortunately, will not fit in this margin, but I have typed some
notes which I can send you if you are interested.

Regards,

Steve Lack.
