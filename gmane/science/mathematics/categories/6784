Dear Marta and all,

The category of simplicial objects in a Grothendieck topos admits a =20
model structure
in which the weak equivalences are the local weak homotopy =20
equivalences and
   the cofibrations are the monomorphisms  (I have described the model =20=

structure in my 1984 letter to Grothendieck).
A higher stack can be defined to be a simplicial object which is =20
globally homotopy equivalent to a fibrant object.

The notion of internal simplicial object can be defined in any =20
elementary topos with natural number object.
The local weak homotopy equivalences between simplicial objects can be =20=

defined internally.

It seems reasonable to introduce a new axiom for an elementary topos E =20=

(with natural number object).
It may be called the Model Structure Axiom:

The MSA axiom: "The category of simplicial objects in E admits a model =20=

structure
in which the weak equivalences are the local weak homotopy =20
equivalences and
the cofibrations are the monomorphisms"

A nice thing about this axiom is that it implies the existence of n-=20
stack completion for every n.
It also implies the existence of infinity-stack completion.

Best,
Andr=E9=
