*** CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS ***

ICLP 2020

36th International Conference on Logic Programming

September 18 - September 24, 2020

University of Calabria, Rende, Italy

https://iclp2020.unical.it

ICLP 2020, the 36th International Conference on Logic Programming,

will be held at the University of Calabria, Rende, Italy, from

September 18 to September 24, 2020.

The ICLP conference series has a long standing tradition of hosting

a rich set of co-located workshops. ICLP workshops provide a unique

opportunity for the presentation and discussion of work that can be

preliminary in nature, novel ideas, and new open problems to a wide

and interested audience.

Co-located workshops also provide an opportunity for presenting

specialized topics and opportunities for intensive discussions and

project collaboration. The topics of the workshops co-located with

ICLP 2020 can cover any areas related to logic programming (e.g.,

theory, implementation, environments, language issues, alternative

paradigms, applications), including cross-disciplinary areas. However,

any relevant workshop proposal will be considered.

The format of the workshop will be decided by the workshop organizers,

but ample time should be allowed for general discussion. Workshops can

vary in length, but the optimal duration will be half a day or a full

day.

Workshop Proposal:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Those interested in organizing a workshop at ICLP 2020 are invited to

submit a workshop proposal. Proposals should be in English and about

two pages in length. They should contain:

* The title of the workshop.

* A brief technical description of the topics covered by the workshop.

* A discussion of the timeliness and relevance of the workshop.

* A list of some related workshops held in the last years.

* The estimated length of the workshop and an estimate of the number

of expected attendees.

* The names, affiliation and contact details (email, web page,

phone) of the workshop organizers together with a designated

contact person.

* Previous experience of the workshop organizers in

workshop/conference organization.

Proposals are expected in text or PDF format. All proposals should be

submitted to the Workshop Chair by email by April 13, 2020.

Reviewing Process:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Each submitted proposal will be reviewed by the Workshop, Program and

General Chairs. Proposals that appear well-organized and that fit the

goals and scope of ICLP will be selected. The decision will be

notified by email to the responsible organizer by April 27, 2020.

The definitive length of the workshop will be planned according to the

number of submissions received by the different workshops. For every

accepted workshop, the ICLP local organizers will prepare a meeting

room. The workshops and the conference organizers will collaborate in

establishing a uniform approach to produce proficient and accessible

proceedings for the workshops.

Workshop Organizers' Tasks:
