Isn't the following a counterexample?

Let A = Set and let B = A\{0} (the category of nonempty sets).  Let F
send the empty set in A to the singleton set in B, and otherwise let F
and U be the evident identity functors between A and B.  Similarly let
\eta and \epsilon be the identity natural transformations, except for
\eta_0 which can only be the unique function from 0 to 1.   Naturality
of \eta and \epsilon depends on both being the identity, except for
\eta_0 but that's from the initial object so all its diagrams commute.

Then 0 equalizes the two arrows from U1 to U2 but \eta_0 does not
equalize UF\eta a and \eta UFa since the latter two are both 1_1 in A
whence they are equalized by 1.
