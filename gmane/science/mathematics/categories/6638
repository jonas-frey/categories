I cannot resist adding my grain of salt.

Maybe we should distinguish between a human proof and a mechanical =
proof.
The goal of a human proof is to convince other peoples of the =
truthfulness
of a proposition.
It is by nature explanatory and it can lead to new insights.
A mechanical proof can be checked by computer but may not produce new =
insights.
It is establishing a fact. Of course, it is better than none.
Mathematics is above all a human activity.
The value of a proof depends very much on its method.
A new proof may suggest a new method.
A method is a kind of toolbox for proving a large class of propositions.
Commutative algebra is a method in geometry
Category theory is a method in mathematics.

proofs --->methods ----> proofs ----> methods .......
