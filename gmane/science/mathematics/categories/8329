Dear Bob,

This is a big shock and terrible news.

Dietmar was one of a kind. Yes, as Bob says, always apologetic.
Yet this reflected his sensitivity both in daily life and in =
mathematics.

We were fortunate that Dietmar and his lovely family visited Macquarie=20=

for 5 months beginning in September 1984. They fitted in very well and
the children liked the schools with the novel uniforms. I remember also
a very pleasant visit to the Schumachers=92 in Wolfville where we learnt =
more
about the origins of the Cajuns we knew from New Orleans.

Dietmar visited again for four months at the end of 1991 and stayed at
our residential college: Dunmore Lang. He charmed the Principal and
managers so much that I was invited to the Dunmore Lang Christmas Party
for many years after that as appreciation for organizing Dietmar=92s =
stay!

Otherwise we met at conferences. A couple of times in Europe,=20
Dietmar would find a document in his briefcase to give me to read.
The cobbled roads and arches we met under, usually in the wet,
made Dietmar remark that he felt like a drug dealer in some
1930s movie.

It is strange how the very little things stick in your memory.
One time when I parked my car next to one with a dent in the side,
Dietmar warned me that the owner might not be so careful opening
their door and I should move. =20
  =20

Please accept my deeply felt condolences, especially Heide and family.

Ross
