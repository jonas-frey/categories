I originally thought it was Set, but this doesn't seem to make sense
using the cartesian product of categories as the monoidal product in
Prof. If this were the case, candidates for the unit and counit would
be the upper and lower stars of the hom functor.

However, let the 1-object category be the monoidal product. Then,
since 1 X C^op X C is isomorphic to C^op X C, we can regard the hom
functor of C as a profunctor 1 --|--> C^op X C,

Hom_C : 1 X C^op X C --> Set

and similarly, the hom functor of C^op as a profunctor C X C^op --|--> 1.

I saw this briefly mentioned here:
http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/trace+of+a+category

Does anyone know if there is a more fleshed out treatment of this
somewhere? Also, do the "lifted" versions of the hom functor (upper
and lower star) serve some structural purpose in Prof?
