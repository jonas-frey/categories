ACM Symposium on Applied Computing
----------------------------------
The ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has gathered scientists
from different areas of computing over the past twenty-eight
years. The forum represents an opportunity to interact with different
communities sharing an interest in applied computing.

SAC 2014 is sponsored by SIGAPP and will be held at the he historic city
of Gyeongju (knows as the Museum without Walls) in Korea.


Software Verification and Testing Track
---------------------------------------
We invite authors to submit new results in formal verification and
testing, as well as development of technologies to improve the
usability of formal methods in software engineering. Also welcome are
detailed descriptions of applications of mechanical verification to
large scale software. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

- model checking
- theorem proving
- correct by construction development
- model-based testing
- verification-based testing
- symbolic execution
- static and run-time analysis
- abstract interpretation
- analysis methods for dependable systems
- software certification and proof carrying code
- fault diagnosis and debugging
- verification of large scale software systems
- real world applications and case studies applying software verification


Submissions Guidelines
----------------------
Paper submissions must be original, unpublished work. Submissions
should be in electronic format, via the START site:
https://www.softconf.com/d/sac2014/. Author(s) name(s) and address(es)
must not appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference should be
avoided and made in the third person. Submitted paper will undergo a
blind review process. Authors of accepted papers should submit an
editorial revision of their papers that fits within six two-column
pages (an extra two pages, to a total of eight pages, may be available
at a charge). Please comply to this page limitation already at
submission time. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM SAC 2014
proceedings.

Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the
paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy
attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement for the
paper/poster to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library. No-show
of scheduled papers and posters will result in excluding them from the
ACM/IEEE digital library.

A special issue of Science of Computer Programming has been
confirmed. Selected papers will be invited for submission, and will be
peer-reviewed according to the standard policy of Science of Computer
Programming.


Student Research Competition
----------------------------
As before, SAC 2013 organises a Student Research Competition (SRC)
Program to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and
exchange ideas with researchers and practitioners in their areas of
interest. Guidelines and information about the SRC program can be
found at http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2014/. Submission to
the SRC program should be in electronic form via the following website
https://www.softconf.com/d/sac-src2014.
