Logic and Theoretical Computer Science.

This position will form part of the NWO-funded VICI project ``Algebra and
Coalgebra: the mathematical environment of modal logic", directed by Dr.
Yde Venema.

Job description
--------------
The successful candidate is expected to do research related to the theory
of modal logic. The investigations will preferably be in the following=20
area:

modal fixpoint logics, coalgebra and automata theory,

but other proposals linking modal logic and (co)algebra will be considere=
d
as well. The position may include minor teaching duties in logic-related
courses.
