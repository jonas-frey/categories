I would suggest that one approach to the use-mention distinction is
given in topos theory, or more generally in categorical logic, when we
can talk about the "internal logic" of a category, and discuss objects
of categories from both the internal and external standpoints.

A common case of this arises in Mike's message when he discusses the
internal hom. Godel, Halting, etc. all can be seen as statements based
on a particular structure surrounding the internal hom as in [1].
