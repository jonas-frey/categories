Fortunately, though, everybody can and is invited add to this site! So
eventually it may speak also of structures --  and much more.

This site was created for exactly the kind of situation we have here:
we have an intersting technical discussion on a mailing list or
similar forum. After a while it will end and a bunch of scattered
messages will remain in the archives of the mailing list. The
important insight gained or exhibited in the discussion will be
non-trivial to find and deduce from the archived discussion threads.
It'll be a shame if all the valuable insight of various participants,
all the energy they invested into composing these messages, find no
more focused and polished incarnation than that.

The above site is meant to provide a place where results of such
discussion is collected in a more useful form. I am hoping that
eventually the upshot of the discussion on "evil" had here on the list
will eventually find a nice incarnation on that site. Everyone can
help to make that come true. Just hit the "edit" button at the bottom
of the page:

Best,
Urs
