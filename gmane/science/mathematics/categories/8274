Dear Thomas,

As I told you in my previous private mail you are entitled to have your =
own view, and to make it public. You don't have to submit me anything. I =
shall of course respect your opinion, even if I disagree with it. (by =
the way I told exactly the same thing to George Janelidze but, not only =
I could not convince him, but I had the impression we were living on =
different planets!).=20
Of course, if I do disagree, I shall tell you why I do, and try to =
convince you by purely mathematical arguments, not by the fact that I =
consider myself as some kind of owner of fibered categories, in spite of =
the important developments of this theory which I introduced.
And I promise to study carefully your own arguments,c and to change my =
views about some questions if you convince me, mathematically.

This is by no means an an answer to your mail. I am preparing a more =
ambitious mail, where I shall expose my views, not only about fibrations =
but on other important issues, some of which have not, or very little, =
been touched by the numerous mails about fibrations exchanged during the =
last weeks.=20
Because of the comprehensive scope of this future mail, I beg you to be =
patient, i shall need some time.
This future mail shall, in a sense, be addressed to me. I'm getting old, =
and I need to think a little about what I have done, and what I should =
have done. (Not only in mathematics of course, but the other domains are =
between me and me).

Best to all,
Jean=
