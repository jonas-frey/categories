I tried to raise some general issues from category theory in Delhi, 2003, a=
nd this was published as =0A=0A136. (with T. Porter), `Category theory and =
higher dimensional algebra: potential descriptive tools in neuroscience', P=
roceedings of the International Conference on Theoretical Neurobiology, Del=
hi,=0AFebruary 2003, edited by Nandini Singh, National Brain Research Centr=
e, Conference Proceedings 1 (2003) 80-92. arXiv:math/0306223=0A=0AOne main =
point was to introduce the notion of colimit, as a method of gluing, and of=
 enabling distributed comunication. Another was to ask: can we really belie=
ve the brain works serially,  in one dimension so to speak?  and so to intr=
oduce some idea that higher dimensional notation and rewriting in higher di=
mensions is possible. =0A=0AWith regard to colimits, one should mention the=
 extensive work of Andree Ehresmann and Jean-Paul Vanbremeersch on `Memory =
evolutive systems', see their recent book=0A=0ACan applications to linguist=
ics be developed in these areas? =0A=0AWhile sending this, I'll mention tha=
t a short note=0A=0A`Moore hyperrectangles on a space form a strict cubical=
 omega-category with connections'=0A=0Ais available from my preprint page=
