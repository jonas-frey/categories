                           TLCA'05 CALL FOR PAPERS

                       Seventh International Conference on
               Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA '05)
                                  Nara, Japan
                               21-23 April 2005
                        (Colocated with RTA as RDP '05)
                  http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/rdp05/tlca/


The TLCA series of conferences serves as a forum for presenting original
research results that are broadly relevant to the theory and applications
of typed lambda calculi and related systems. The following list of topics
is non-exhaustive:

   * Typed and untyped lambda-calculi as models of computation.
   * Proof-theory: Natural deduction, sequent calculi, cut elimination
     and normalization. Propositions as types, linear logic and proof nets.
   * Types: Subtypes, dependent types, type inference, polymorphism,
     types for security.
   * Semantics: Denotational semantics, game semantics, realizability,
     categorical models.
   * Programming languages: Foundations of functional and object-oriented
     programming, proof search, logic programming, type checking.
   * Implementation: Abstract machines, parallel execution, optimal
     reduction, program optimization.
   * Computer-aided reasoning.

The programme of TLCA'05 will consist of three invited talks and about 25
papers selected from original contributions. Accepted papers will be published
as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

text) of no more than 150 words should be sent separately at least a week
before the paper submission deadline.

All submissions should be sent by e-mail to tlca05@mimuw.edu.pl


Important dates:
