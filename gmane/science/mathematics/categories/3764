                            Call for Participation

         14th Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation
                               (WoLLIC'2007)
                          Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
                              July 2-5, 2007
    (a satellite event to Brazilian Computer Society Conference - CSBC'07)

    WoLLIC is an annual international forum on inter-disciplinary research
    involving formal logic, computing and programming theory, and natural
    language and reasoning.  Each meeting includes invited talks and
    tutorials as well as contributed papers.

    The Fourteenth WoLLIC will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from
    July 2 to July 5, 2007, in conjunction with the 27th Brazilian
    Computer Society Conference. It is sponsored by the Association for
    Symbolic Logic (ASL), the Interest Group in Pure and Applied Logics
    (IGPL), the European Association for Logic, Language and Information
    (FoLLI), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science
    (EATCS), the Sociedade Brasileira de Computacao (SBC), and the
    Sociedade Brasileira de Logica (SBL).

PROCEEDINGS
    The proceedings of WoLLIC'2007, including both invited and contributed
    papers, will be published in advance of the meeting as a volume in
    Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science.  In addition,
    abstracts will be published in the Conference Report section of
    the Logic Journal of the IGPL, and selected contributions will
    be published as a special post-conference WoLLIC'2007 special issue
    of the journal Information and Computation.
