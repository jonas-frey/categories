a) I have uploaded to

http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/pdf/sketch.pdf

a version of my 1993 sketches paper with an addendum listing a few
relevant papers not included in the original work. =A0 I have not kept
up with the field well enough to contemplate a complete revision of
the 1993 paper.

b) There has recently been an uptick in citations to my paper [1].
Several works over the years ([2], [3], [4]) have given proofs of my
theorem that are easier to understand and more informative, so I have
posted a package=A0here

http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/pdf/AGEPackage.pdf

that contains the original paper, a correction I published later, and
the references below.=A0 Malfait's article in particular embeds my exact
sequence into a remarkable=A0cube=A0of exact sequences.

c) I recommend that more people update their papers in the manner I
have updated these two.  I did it by making a new PDF file with the
added references and then using Acrobat to combine it with the old
paper into one file.=A0 That way I didn=92t have to re-TeX the old paper
(in the case of the sketches paper), which is a good thing, since I
don=92t know where some of the .sty files are.
