Michael,

Cognitive Neuroscience, if we=92re successful in surviving dissociative =
experiments which we don=92t have funding for at present (lots of =
cutbacks and competition for funds).  Here are some refs; if interested, =
I can send:

This one has a link:

Systems,=20

There=92s more, including a beginning at addressing episodic memory.  =
We=92ve done quite a bit on that more recently and haven=92t had time to =
write it all up.  Also, Tom and I are on ResearchGate.

Best regards,
Mike
