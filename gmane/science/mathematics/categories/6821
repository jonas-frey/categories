Dear all,

I just realized that this job opportunity hasn't been advertised on
the categories list.   Sorry for the late notice but you've still got
3 weeks to apply.

We have a very good culture in category theory, type theory, logic and
semantics in Birmingham.  Our researchers in the School of Computer
Science include Martin Escardo, Dan Ghica, Achim Jung, me, Uday Reddy,
Eike Ritter, Steve Vickers and Hayo Thielecke.

Please feel free to ask any questions.

regards,
Paul

Birmingham Fellows:
+++++++++++++++
The University of Birmingham is making a major investment to recruit
post-doctoral fellows of the very highest calibre. We are conducting a
global search to recruit up to 50 Birmingham Fellows in priority and
interdisciplinary areas across the university. The Birmingham Fellows
will be outstanding post-doctoral researchers who are on a trajectory
to become the next generation of research and academic leaders. The
Birmingham Fellowships have been designed to support the Fellows as
they establish themselves as rounded and mature academics at the
University of Birmingham.The Fellowships will be five-year
appointments, giving the Fellows the time they need to engage in
serious research and to establish themselves within the academic
community at Birmingham, nationally and internationally.  Fellows who
meet their potential and perform according to the expectations agreed
at the beginning of their fellowship term will be offered a permanent
post at the end of the fellowship term.

Although research-focused, Fellows will be appointed to research and
teaching contracts, reflecting our commitment to teaching as an
integral part of an academic career. At the start of the Fellowship
period, the emphasis will be on consolidating an already-outstanding
research trajectory, but Fellows will be expected to engage in PhD
supervision and to develop a growing teaching portfolio over their
five-year term. Fellows will not be expected to engage in substantive
academic management or administration during their Fellowship term.

The School of Computer Science, The University of Birmingham, UK
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Computer Science at Birmingham dates back to the late 1950?s with the
School of Computer Science becoming one of the first academic
departments in the UK to undertake research and teaching in this
field. The School has around 40 academic staff, 25 research fellows,
80 PhD students and approximately 400 undergraduate and postgraduate
students. Our research programmes are supported by a wide range of
bodies, including UK and EU research councils, overseas governments
and universities and UK and multi-national companies.The School is
proud to provide and sustain a lively and purposeful research culture.
It is ranked in the top ten UK computer science departments by the
Research Evaluation Exercise 2008, conducted by the UK government.

Within the School of Computer Science there are strong groups working
on Nature-Inspired and Intelligent Computation, Intelligent Robotics,
Computing Systems, Theoretical Computer Science, Software Engineering,
Medical Imaging, and Human-Computer Interaction. There is considerable
interaction between different areas, and several people work in two or
more groups. The School has no divisive fragmentation  into separately
managed subgroups, and maintains a friendly and collaborative
atmosphere with a highly consultative management style. There are
normally three or four research seminars each week, with a good
balance between visiting and internal speakers and between formality
and informality. A significant proportion of the School's budget is
used for research support, including provision for modern computing
facilities, a school library to complement the main university
library, funding or travel for conferences, regular visiting seminar
speakers, and guest positions.


Birmingham Fellows at the School of Computer Science
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Outstanding candidates in all fields of computer science are welcome
to apply as long as they can demonstrate how their work will
complement and enhance excellence at the school. In particular, we
invite
outstanding applicants in areas related to the school research strength:

Nature-Inspired and Intelligent Computation: The main interests of
this group are natural computation, machine learning and data mining,
medical image interpretation, theorem proving.

Intelligent Robotics: Interests include computer vision, recognition,
task planning, reasoning under uncertainty, and cognitive
architectures.

Computer Security: The research interests of this group include
security protocols, access control systems, applied cryptography,
software security.

Theoretical Computer Science: The focus of this group is on
mathematical foundations of computer science such as domain theory,
exact numerical computation, computational logic and logic of topology
and toposes, as well as on the semantics and formal methods for
programming languages.

Foundational Theory of Computation: programming languages and
semantics (including concurrent systems); domain theory and
applications of topology to computation (for example, exact
real-number computation); topos theory (especially as applied to
quantum physics and quantum computation).

Logic and Algebra: algebraic structures (such as loops and
quasi-groups); computational algebra and theorem-proving; logic and
model-checking (with applications to security); topological aspects of
logic.

Algorithms: optimization and heuristic search (design of algorithms
and their run-time analysis); theory of evolutionary computation; data
analysis and data mining.

Software Engineering:  Cloud software engineering, requirements,
software
architectures, model-driven engineering, automated software
engineering and tools, security software engineering, search-based
software engineering, and/or robotics software engineering.

Medical Imaging and Interpretation: focus on optical imaging for the
detection of skin cancer, early signs of retinopathies, colon and
breast cancer; optical tomographic imaging of the human brain and
multi-modality imaging, and image coregistration.

Human-Computer Interaction: including mobile computing; interaction
technologies; usability and design; research on natural language
processing and understanding; document and text analysis.
