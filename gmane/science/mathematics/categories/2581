I'm surprised no-one seems to have mentioned John Hobby's METAPOST
language. This is a mostly declarative language, with the capability of
solving linear equations. (So you can, for example, express that one item
appears halfway between two others, and that relationship will be
maintained as either endpoint moves.) It also integrates beautifully with
LaTeX. If you're neither a Picasso nor a Mondriaan, but you like writing
programs, I would have said this was the tool for you. Should come with
any decent TeX distribution.
