I think "constant function" should be reserved for functions
that *do* take input, but care not a whit what that input is,
always providing the same output regardless what the input.

A function with empty domain, on the other hand, never even has
a chance of getting called (as you so correctly observe below), =

hence has *no* output whatsoever (and is certainly not a =

constant function).

Think your student would be able to digest that? If suitably
premasticated, perhaps?
