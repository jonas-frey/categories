Dear all,

We would like to invite you for the 79th meeting of the Peripatetic
Seminar on  Sheaves and Logic, which will be held in the weekend of the
28th and 29th of  June near Utrecht, the Netherlands. It is organized by
the University of Utrecht  with financial support of the MRI, the
Mathematical Research Institute.

As a special attraction, Clemens Berger will give a tutorial on
theta-categories, a topic from higher-dimensional category theory.

For the entire weekend, we will stay at the conference centre "Kaap
Doorn", near  Utrecht (www.kaapdoorn.nl), which can easily be reached by
public transport.

Concerning these and other matters a webpage can be consulted, one that
is at  the moment under construction. The address will be:

http://www.math.uu.nl/people/vdberg/PSSL79

Here we will also announce the precise costs for the stay at the
conference  centre.

People who wish to attend the PSSL should send an e-mail to the address
below.  Please indicate if you want to give a talk.

With best regards,

The organizers,

Jaap van Oosten
Federico di Marchi
Pieter Hofstra
Claire Kouwenhoven-Gentil
Benno van den Berg
