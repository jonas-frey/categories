According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla, gorillas in captivity
tend to obesity and earlier maturation of females, and have been taught
sign language.  It doesn't mention any other differences, and the rest
of the article is about gorillas in the wild.  Does this make a "topos
in the classical world" a gros topos and the wild ones petit?  The
analogy is rather on the colorful side for me.

The first half of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topos is about
Grothendieck topoi [sic], the rest about elementary toposes (was topoi
but I changed it out of deference to PTJ's strong feelings in the
matter).  The Explanation section (my contribution, intended as a
response to the "respectful awe" tone of the comments on the article's
talk page reacting to the bald definition, i.e. the commenters seemed
largely mystified but accepted this as par for the course for anything
this far beyond rocket science) is presented from the point of view of
elementary toposes as a solution to the problem of characterizing the
notion of subobject in elementary terms.

My question to Steve and the list as a whole would be, if you had been
assigned the task of writing an explanation section following the formal
definition section, where would you have put the emphasis: on how the
definition facilitates a first-order characterization of the notion of
"subobject", or on the geometric morphism perspective?
