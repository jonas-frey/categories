Even though I was one of the dozen students, along with Ross Street and
Brian Day, who took Max Kelly's course in category theory at the
University of Sydney in 1965, unlike them I went in other directions
thereafter.?? It is therefore a bit surprising that I kept bumping into
Fred Linton, who turned out to have other interests that kept bringing
me into contact with him over the past four decades in matters arguably
unrelated to category theory: computer software, Jonsson-Tarski
algebras, electrical engineering, 3D rendering of knots, etc.

But it is Fred's foundational work on monads that I want to comment on
here.???? At UACT, the Universal Algebra and Category Theory meeting at
MSRI organized by respectively Ralph McKenzie and Saunders Mac Lane in
1992, there were back-to-back talks in a late-morning two-talk session
on what I like to think of today as the foundations of equational model
theory, EML.?? These were given by Walt Taylor and Fred Linton in that order.

Ok, so who here noticed these two talks were both on EML??? Not me, I was
a computer scientist still getting acclimated to such abstractions.??
Maybe some people, but if so the connection passed entirely without
comment at the time, like ships passing in the night, and we all headed
off for lunch.

At lunch I sat with George McNulty, Walt's coauthor along with Ralph
McKenzie of the classic UA text /Algebras, lattices, varieties/, Volume
1, 1987, the book that took two pages to explain why (for any given
signature with no constants) the empty algebra was a bad idea.

As a result of my much earlier work on dynamic algebras George and I
went back several years and he was keen to understand what Fred had been
on about in his just-ended talk.?? So with the fervor of a missionary I
launched into monad theory, which I'd been teaching at Stanford for
several years.

No luck.?? In retrospect what I should have done instead was try to make
some sort of connection between Walt's and Fred's two back-to-back talks
on EML.

In my mind, whether fairly or unfairly, what distinguished Fred from his
fellow category theorists at UACT was that he was the natural CT
representative of EML.

There is one other anecdote about UACT, nothing to do with Fred, that I
have always loved.?? In the course of MSRI director Bill Thurston's
opening remarks, he said words to the effect that the notion of the
opposite of a category made him nauseous.?? This was the only meeting I
have ever attended where fully half the attendees drew in enough breath
to drop the air pressure by an audible amount.
