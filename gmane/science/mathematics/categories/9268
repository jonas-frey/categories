Dear All,

   With regard to the recent postings about modelling general n-types and n-=
fold groupoids, I would like to point out the following. A proof of the mod=
elling of general n-types (not only path-connected ones) using n-fold struc=
tures is given in the following research monograph, which I recently posted=
  on arVix:

S.Paoli, Segal-type models of higher categories, arXiv.1707.01868

The structure used there, called groupoidal weakly globular n-fold categori=
es, is a subcategory of n-fold categories in which certain sub-structures a=
re groupoidal, and satisfying several other conditions. This result is a pr=
oof of the homotopy hypothesis for a new model of weak n-categories, called=
  weakly globular n-fold categories, which is proved to be suitably equivale=
nt to the Tamsamani-Simpson model.

In the above work there is also a proof that it is possible to use as funda=
mental functor from spaces to groupoidal weakly globular n-fold categories =
the construction found in the following paper

D. Blanc, S. Paoli, Segal-type algebraic models of n-types, Algebraic and G=
eometric Topology, 14  3419=963491.

This construction produces a functor from spaces to a subcategory of n-fold=
  groupoids.

Best wishes,

Simona.
