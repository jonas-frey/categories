I think the explanation is rather simple. The first point is that the
foundations here are Bourbaki set theory: everything is a set,
including a category.  When they say that C belongs to U, they
literally mean that C, when rigorously formalised as a set, is an
element of U. The same goes for a functor.

The second point is that U-smallness of a set X is defined to be a set
which is isomorphic to an element of U, not necessarily an actual
element of U. The word 'isomorphic' is underlined.

Let us consider (C2) first. The axioms of a universe only allow one to
construct sets in the universe from other sets in the universe. Since
U is not in U, there is no way that any definition/construction
involving it can produce a set in U. Certainly one needs to involve U
to be able to define the Hom sets of Func(C, U-Ens).

But the Hom sets of Func(C, U-Ens) are isomorphic to elements of U,
i.e. are U-small. This is because U-Ens is a U-category, i.e. the Hom
sets are U-small.

One can make the same point about the set of objects of Func(C,
U-Ens).  One needs U to define it, so it is certainly not an element
of U. It is not even isomorphic to an element of U, because this would
imply that the cardinality of U is strictly less than U. In (C1), it
is not exactly this that is asked, but rather that the set of objects
of Func(C, U-Ens) is a subset of U. This is impossible for the same
kind of reasons: one will need to consider for instance a subset of
the set C x U to define it, and there is no way that show that this is
a subset of U (it is perfectly possible if instead of U we have some
element u of U, because then the product of C and u belongs to U).

Hence Func(C, U-Ens) is, as SGA claims, the prototypical example to
illustrate why the definition of a U-category is exactly the way it
is.

Best wishes,
Richard
