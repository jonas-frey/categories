Dear Jean,

Sticking to the pattern I suggested I'd call it "essentially subterminal".

> Non evil is essentially evil.
> I rather like this conclusion, don't you?

Of course, that's brilliant dialectics! I'd expect the people abhoring evilness
would say that full and faithful and essentially surjective is an "evil" notion
of equivalence as opposed to the "good" one of adjoint pair where unit and
counit are isos. The latter makes sense in any 2-category whereas the former
doesn't. However, often you just get the "evil" version when not having
a strong form of AC (for classes) available. That's why your dialectics
definitely applies!

Best regards, Thomas
