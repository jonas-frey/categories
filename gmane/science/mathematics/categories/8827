                    Call for Short Contributions and Participation

                         13th International Workshop on
                  Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science (CMCS'16)
                      2 - 3 April 2016, Eindhoven, the Netherlands
                          http://www.coalg.org/cmcs16

Objectives and scope
-------------------
Established in 1998, the CMCS workshops aim to bring together researchers
with a common interest in the theory of coalgebras, their logics, and their
applications. As the workshop series strives to maintain breadth in its scope,
areas of interest include neighbouring fields as well. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to, the following:


- The theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
     approaches)
- Coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for
     programming languages, dynamical systems, term rewriting, etc.)
- Coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent, and constraint)
     programming
- Model checking, theorem proving and deductive verification
     using coalgebraic techniques
- Coalgebraic data types, type systems and
     behavioural typing
- Proof principles and (coinductive) definitions for
     coalgebras (e.g. with bisimulations or invariants)
- Coalgebras and algebras
- Coalgebraic specification and verification
- Coalgebras and (modal) logic
- Coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event
     and hybrid systems)
- Coalgebra in quantum computing
-  Coalgebra and game theory
- Tools exploiting colgebraic techniques

Venue and event
---------------
CMCS'16 will be held in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, co-located with ETAPS 2016 on
2 - 3 April 2016.

Submission guidelines
---------------------
Short contributions may describe work in progress, or summarise
work submitted to a conference or workshop elsewhere. They
should be no more than two pages n Springer LNCS style. Short
contributions should be submitted electronically as a PDF file
