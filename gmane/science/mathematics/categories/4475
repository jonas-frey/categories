Dear Toby,

What you call a cocategory enriched over V can also be
described as a category enriched over V^op. These have been
studied by Paddy McCrudden in his thesis under the name
"coalgebroids" (= many-object coalgebras). The main results
are on a generalised notion of Tannakian duality; and on
transfer of extra structure across this duality. See
respectively:

[1] Paddy McCrudden, Categories of Representations of Coalgebroids,
Advances in Mathematics Volume 154, Issue 2, Pages 299-332

Theory and Applications of Categories, Vol. 7, pp 71-147.
