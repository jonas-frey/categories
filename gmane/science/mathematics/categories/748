Calculemus and Types 98 / User Interfaces for Theorem Provers 1998

Call for Participation and Final Programme


Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, 13-15th July 1998 
http://www.win.tue.nl/~calc




A few years ago, several groups from the deduction and computer
algebra communities decided to work together towards the integration
of theorem provers and computer algebra systems. This collaborative
project has been called Calculemus.  The Types project has operated in
much the same direction, but with a stronger focus on Lambda-Calculus.
Significant progress has now been achieved and it has been decided
that this workshop will be fully open and provide the atmosphere for
discussion among the two communities.  

The workshop will be held in parallel with the UITP workshop on the
analysis and design of user interfaces for theorem proving assistants.


For full details of the workshop, hotel reservation and the registration 
form consult:
     http://www.win.tue.nl/~calc
     http://www.win.tue.nl/cs/ipa/uitp/


Early registration and hotel reservation is strongly recommended
since the number of delegates we can accommodate is limited.


Presentations in the first column of the programme are part of the
UITP workshop, presentations in the second column are Calculemus and
Types presentations. Presentations in the middle are joint.  Delegates
will be free to move between the two workshops.
