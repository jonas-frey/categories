From: Matthew Hennessy <matthewh@cogs.susx.ac.uk>


                       UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX
            
            RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING

One Research Fellow is required  to join the EPSRC funded project
entitled ``Foundations for the Integration of Concurrent Distributed
and Functional Computation'', under the direction of
Matthew Hennessy.

The aim of the project is to 

- provide a uniform coherent semantic foundation for concurrent,
distributed and functional behaviour;

- develop proof methodologies for establishing properties of process
descriptions expressed in specification languages using these
paradigms;

- develop prototypes of supporting verification systems.

The project has already been running for approximately 18 months
and work has concentrated on two streams of research:

     - development of languages, type systems and behavioural 
       theories for mobile computing, where independent processes roam
       widely distributed networks in search of resources and information.
    
     - denotational models for languages combining higher-order
       functional notation with the pi-calculus (examples include
       Cml and core Facile)

The successful candidate will be expected to carry out research 
related to one of these topics. The appointment will be for a period
of two years, starting on 1/04/98,  and salary will be related to the
academic 1A scale. A Ph.D. in Computer Science or Mathematics or
equivalent experience is required. In addition to normal research
duties the successful candidate will be expected to provide some 
assistance to undergraduate teaching.
