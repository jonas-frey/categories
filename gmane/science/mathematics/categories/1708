Abstract:

It has already been noticed by C. Elgot and his
collaborators that the algebra of (finite and infinite)
trees is completely iterative, i.e., every system of
ideal recursive equations has a unique solution.
We prove that this is a special case of a very general
coalgebraic phenomenon: suppose that an endofunctor
H of an abstract category A is ``iterative'',
i.e., that it has the property that for every object
X in A a final coalgebra for H(_)+X
exists. Then these final coalgebras, TX, form a
monad on A, called the iteration monad of H.
And every ideal equation e : X --> T(X+Y) has 
a unique solution e^+: X --> TY.

We also present a more general view substituting
the category [A,A] of all endofunctors
of A by a monoidal category B: an  object H in B 
is called iterative if the endofunctor 
H tensor (_)+I  of B has a final coalgebra. This coalgebra 
is, then, a monoid in B, called the iteration monoid
of H. And the assignment of an iteration monoid
to all objects forms a monoid in [B,B].
