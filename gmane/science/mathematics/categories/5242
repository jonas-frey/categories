I do appreciate the example since I wondered if the "connecting
homomorphism" could be induced by a composite of relations as in the snake
lemma.  I thought not and George has provided an example.  Since Tuesday,
we have had house guests so I really have not had time to absorb all the
replies, but when I have time, I plan to collect them all and try to see
if there is a satisfactory general answer of which the two instances I
described are special cases.  There is something going on here that I
don't quite comprehend (although maybe the answer is in the theorem Marco
mentioned.

Since my curious sequence was an exercise in CWM, it is surprising that
Saunders never raised the question in the form I did.  The conclusion
certainly looks like something out of the snake lemma, but I was unable to
formulate it as a cosequence.

Incidentally, the theorem on acyclic models, as it appears in my book,
can be described as a map induced by a composite of relations that, in
homology, becomes functional.
