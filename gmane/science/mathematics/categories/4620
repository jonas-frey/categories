All,

i have been utterly delighted by this conversation. What i can't help but
think about, however, is that with the internet we have a different sort of
opportunity. Let me try to describe it.

   - What is missing in most mathematical presentations is a view into the
   often very human and very messy process of getting to the presentation. =
What
   young mathematicians need -- in my view -- is a view of mathematicians d=
oing
   mathematics. They need to see very top-down orientations rubbing elbows =
with
   very bottoms-up orientations. They need to see highly inventive, unifyin=
g
   viewpoints come up against skeptical viewpoints armed with vast arrays o=
f
   counter-examples. They need to see people desperately trying to organize
   while others are desperately trying to de-construct. This is where the l=
ife
   of mathematics is. This is how people bring mathematics to life.
   - With the internet we have the opportunity to record not just the final
   artifact, tractate or wiki, but the process. Ever since Andre Joyal
   mentioned a 2nd life for Bourbaki i can't stop thinking about a Bourbaki
   colloquium run in Second Life <http://secondlife.com/> -- so that
   whatever the outcome of a given process is in terms of artifact, people =
can
   go back and look at the process, itself. They can see how people argued =
and
   counter-argued. There is getting to be a precendent for this, from
   Harvard<http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/12/harvard-class-invades-second-l=
ife/>to
   Intel <http://softwarecommunity.intel.com/articles/eng/1283.htm>, to run
   serious technical conversation in Second Life.

Perhaps this idea is too far out, but i would urge those who seriously
consider a second life for Bourbaki to remember to record the living part a=
s
well as the outcome. After all, looking over the last many emails to
categories so much of it is an attempt to recover process -- how things got
to be where they are.

Best wishes,

--greg
