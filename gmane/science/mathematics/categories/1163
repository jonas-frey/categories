The 1999 Annual Conference of the European Association for Computer
Science Logic follows previous CSL Conferences:
   CSL'98 (Brno, Czech Republic), CSL'97 (Aarhus, Denmark),
   CSL'96 (Utrecht, The Netherlands), CSL'95 (Paderborn, Germany),
   CSL'94 (Kazimierz, Poland), CSL'93 (Swansea, United Kingdom),
   CSL'92(San Miniato, Italy), CSL'91 (Berne, Switzerland),
   CSL'90 (Heidelberg, Germany), CSL'89 (Kaiserslautern, Germany),
   CSL'88 (Duisburg, Germany), and CSL'87 (Karlsruhe, Germany).
CSL'99 will be held in Madrid (Spain). The event is
organized jointly by the Computer Science Departments
(DSIP and DACYA) of Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

The scientific program includes 34 selected papers from among 91
submissions, five invited lectures, and two tutorials on theorem
proving and rewriting techniques, scheduled on September 24
afternoon (Friday) and September 25 morning (Saturday), immediately
after the main conference.

In addition to the scientific program, the social program includes
an excursion to Segovia (a nearby historic city), and a conference
dinner. Madrid offers the opportunity to enjoy both Spain and one of
the most attractive capitals in Europe.

In this document you can find the Invited Lecturers, Tutorials,
Scientific Programme, General Information, Registration and
Accommodation Information. The CSL'99 Web page
http://mozart.sip.ucm.es:1580/csl99/
contains additional information.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Place and travel

The Conference will be held in Madrid (Spain), at the Faculty of
Mathematics of Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM),
from the 20th to the 25th of September, 1999.

connections from elsewhere. Barajas, the international Madrid airport, is
only about 10 km from the city. There are frequent regular buses and taxis
to the city, as well as the new metropolitan line.
The Faculty of Mathematics can be reached by metro (metropolitan station
Ciudad Universitaria or Metropolitano) or by bus (bus lines 132, F, or 82).
The CSL'99 Web page (http://mozart.sip.ucm.es:1580/csl99/) contains
additional information such as the metropolitan network map, and the
surroundings to CSL host site map.
