I don't know of any such attempts.  I've always wanted such a database!  An
obvious place to create it is on the nLab.  I just started one:

http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/database+of+categories

but it will only become interesting after a while.

If everyone here contributes an entry or two today, it will be interesting
by tomorrow!

Best,
