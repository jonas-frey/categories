                               FMCS 2009
       17th Workshop on Foundational Methods in Computer Science
                 University of British Columbia, VANCOUVER, Canada
                         MAY 28th - 31st, 2009

                           FOURTH ANNOUNCEMENT

                                 * * *

Registration forms are available from the conference webpage

http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/general-event/foundational-methods-computer-science-2009

Accommodations may also be reserved from the same page. There are in fact
some rooms still available. Reservations can be cancelled without penalty
until 48 hours before the arrival date so it is to your advantage to book
if there is even a slight possibility that you may attend.

The next announcement will contain a complete list of participants so if
you are not on the current list  and you will or may attend, then please
send email to johnm@math.ubc.ca with subject heading FMCS09 - WILL ATTEND
or FMCS09 - MAY ATTEND.

A schedule of talks will be posted on the website on or about May 20. In
the meantime those who have never attended an FMCS meeting may wish to get
an idea of the range of topics by looking at the talks given in 2008 at
Halifax appearing in http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/fmcs2008/

The conference begins with a reception at 6pm on Thursday May 28th in the
Ruth Blair room at Gage Towers on the University of British Columbia
campus and ends at 1pm on Sunday May 31st. On May 29th there will be
tutorials given by Ernie Manes(University of Massachusetts), Vaughan
Pratt(Stanford University) and Pieter Hofstra(University of Ottawa). This
will be followed by a day and a half of research talks by some of the
participants listed below. There is still room for more participants and
for a few more talks so if you would like to speak please let me know by
May 18th before the program is posted.

The following paragraphs repeat the information from the first
announcement.

The Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia
in cooperation with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences
is hosting the Foundational Methods in Computer Science workshop
on May 28th - 31st, 2009, on the University of British Columbia
Campus in Vancouver, Canada

The workshop is an annual informal meeting intended to bring together
researchers in mathematics and computer science. There is a focus
on the application of category theory in computer science. However, all
those who are interested in category theory or computer science are
welcome to attend.

The meeting begins with a reception at 6pm in the Ruth Blair room
in Walter Gage Towers on the UBC campus on Thursday May 28, 2009.
The scientific program starts on May 29, and consists of a day of
tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to category theory, as well as a
day and a half of research talks. The meeting ends at mid-day on May 31.

Research talks

There will be some invited presentations, but the majority of the
talks are solicited from the participants. If you wish to give a talk
please send a title and abstract to johnm@math.ubc.ca. Time slots are
limited, so please register early if you would like to be considered for a
talk.

Graduate student participation is particularly encouraged at FMCS.
