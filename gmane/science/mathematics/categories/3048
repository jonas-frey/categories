it looks like the part before the ellipsis
was written by English Wikipedia User Chalst
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chalst>,
who is apparently Charles Stewart, a postdoc
at the International Centre for Computational Logic;
and the rest was written by English Wikipedia User Charles Matthews
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Charles_Matthews>,
who is now a hobbyist but was once an academic mathematician.
(I'm familiar with Charles Matthews and trust him,
if my opinion matters to anybody; I don't know Chalst.)
Of course, either may have copied from somewhere else
without proper attribution (that's been common ~within~ Wikipedia
--that is copying or moving from one WP article to another--
but it's pretty rare ~into~ Wikipedia, in my experience.)

I'm not sure how this affects Paul Levy's point,
but I guess that I'll let Paul speak on that.
