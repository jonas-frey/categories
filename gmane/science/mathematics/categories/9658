[Thanks a lot for disseminating among potentially interested
candidates. Apologies for multiple copies]

Dear colleagues,

For our research project (ERATO MMSD, Metamathematics for
Systems Design) we are looking for senior researchers and postdocs
(10+ positions in total and some are still open), together with
research assistants (PhD students) and internship students.
The project runs until March 2022.
http://group-mmm.org/eratommsd

This broad project aims to extend the realm of formal methods from
software to cyber-physical systems (CPS), with particular emphases on
logical/categorical metatheories and industrial application esp. in
automotive industry.

In order to deal with the complexity of real-world cyber-physical systems,
we need to rely on empirical, learning-based and data-driven measures for
quality assurance (such as search-based testing). At the same
time, we are finding logical and automata-theoretic methods--the bedrock of
formal verification and synthesis--playing
pivotal roles also in those empirical quality assurance measures. This way,
our
project offers an exciting scientific environment that mixes formal methods,
software engineering and machine learning. We also collaborate closely with
https://www.autonomoose.net/, an automated driving project at Waterloo,
Canada.

The following are prerequisites for application.

    - Your background in one of the following fields: formal methods,
    programming languages, control theory, control engineering, software
    science, software engineering, machine learning, numerical optimization,
    user interface, mathematical logic or category theory
    - Your willingness to dive into the heterogeneous (and thus exciting!)
    scientific environment as described in the above

Best regards,
