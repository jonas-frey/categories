                Second Call for Papers

           Eighth International Conference on

     Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications  (TLCA '07)

                Paris, June 26-28, 2007

		http://www.rdp07.org/tlca.html
	http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/rdp07/tlca.html

    Part of Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and
	          Programming (RDP'07)

	** Title and abstract due  22 December 2006 **
	** Deadline for submission  2 January 2006 ***

The TLCA series of conferences serves as a forum for presenting
original research results that are broadly relevant to the theory
and applications of typed calculi. The following list of topics
is non-exhaustive:

    * Proof-theory: Natural deduction and sequent calculi, cut
      elimination and normalisation, linear logic and proof nets,
      type-theoretic aspects of computational complexity
    * Semantics: Denotational semantics, game semantics,
      realisability, categorical models
    * Implementation: Abstract machines, parallel execution, optimal
      reduction, type systems for program optimisation
    * Types: Subtypes, dependent types, type inference, polymorphism,
      types in theorem proving
    * Programming: Foundational aspects of functional and
      object-oriented programming, proof search and logic programming,
      connections between and combinations of functional and logic
      programming, type checking

The programme of TLCA'07 will consist of three invited talks and about
25 papers selected from original contributions. Accepted papers will
be published as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science
series (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html).

Invited Speakers and Special Events:
------------------------------------

There will be invited talks by

    * Patrick Baillot (CNRS, University Paris 13)
    * Greg Morrisett (Harvard University)
    * Frank Pfenning (Carnegie Mellon University), joint with RTA

An evening session will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the lambda
calculus:

    * Henk Barendregt (Nijmegen University):
      Diamond Anniversary of Lambda Calculus

Submissions:
------------
The submitted papers should describe original work and should allow
the Programme Committee to assess the merits of the contribution. In
particular references and comparisons with related work should be
included. Submission of material already published or submitted to
other conferences with published proceedings is not allowed. Papers
should not exceed 15 pages in Springer LNCS format
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html).

Instructions for online submissions are found at the conference
webpage (http://www.rdp07.org/tlca.html).

January 2     Deadline for submission
March 10-15   Author review period
March 25      Notification of acceptance-rejection
