Title: Directed algebraic topology and higher dimensional transition system

Abstract :
Cattani-Sassone's notion of higher dimensional transition system is
interpreted as a small-orthogonality class of a locally finitely presentable
topological category of weak higher dimensional transition systems. In
particular, the higher dimensional transition system associated with the
labelled $n$-cube turns out to be the free higher dimensional transition
system generated by one $n$-dimensional transition. As a first application of
this construction, it is proved that the category of higher dimensional
transition systems is equivalent to a full reflective subcategory of the
category of labelled symmetric precubical sets. As a second application, it is
given a factorization of the mapping taking a CCS process name to a flow
through higher dimensional transition systems. The second application of this
paper can be easily adapted to other process algebras and to other topological
models of concurrency than the one of flows.
