That is really fascinating.  I assume that when you wrote A --> B --> B'
--> C, that last should have been C'.  Here is how it arose.  Call a map A
--> B cotorsion if its cokernel is torsion (for a generalized notion of
torsion).  Assuming that torsion objects are closed under extension (and
that a quotient of torsion is torsion) this allows a proof that a
composite of cotorsion maps is cotorsion.

Anyway, thanks.
