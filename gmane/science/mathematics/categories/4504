I am NOT about to change a word that has apparently existed for over 50
years just because it is not particularly meaningful.  Does "ring", which
originally referred to Z/nZ, still have any connection with the notion?
How about "field" or as the French and Germans call them "body" have any
connection with fields.  The worst thing is to create a fork in the
language.  I have my own idea on what a better word would be but I'll be
damned if I state it in a public forum.  Anyway, I gather that
Grothendieck's definition is hardly used today.

It is interesting that the less important question (and ultimately
unimportant) question has flooded the list, while the serious one (what
was Grothendieck's supposed to be) has been ignored.  I have no
suggestion, save my own, for what definition was actually intended.
