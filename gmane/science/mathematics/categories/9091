Dear David,

I am sure you will get a few responses telling you that the result, as
you state it, is not quite correct. What is correct is that, given an
adjunction L -| R: UC <---> UD:

a) endowments of L with oplax monoidal structure are in bijection, under
the mates correspondence, with endowments of R with lax monoidal
structure

b) given endowments of L and R with lax monoidal structure, the unit and
counit of the adjunction satisfy the conditions to be monoidal
transformations if and only if the given lax constraint cells on L are
inverse to the oplax constraint cells induced from R via a)

whence:

c) liftings of the adjunction L -| R to an adjunction in the 2-category
of monoidal categories, lax monoidal functors and monoidal
transformations are in bijective correspondence with endowments of L
with strong monoidal structure

There is a dual b') of b) giving the dual

c') liftings of the adjunction L -| R to an adjunction in the 2-category
of monoidal categories, oplax monoidal functors and monoidal
transformations are in bijective correspondence with endowments of R
with strong monoidal structure

of c). All of this follows from the general considerations in Kelly
"Doctrinal adjunction" SLNM 420, though it would be more perspicuous to
prove it directly following Kelly's schema.

Richard
