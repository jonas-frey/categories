Hi John

Interesting result. Especially the way in which the
correct 2-structure follows from cartesian closure.

An analogous result may be the (exension from=20
posetal domains to categories of) closure under=20
filtered colimits of various shapes. Possibly there
is a common generalization to connected limits=20
or colimits ?
