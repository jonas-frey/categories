Dear all,

The fact that the 'right' morphisms of topos theory (geometric morphisms) a=
re not structure preserving maps gives rise to the debate. With an entirely=
  localic approach the situation can be recovered; but at the cost of moving=
  from 'elementary topos' as primitive to 'category of locales'. Here geomet=
ric morphisms can be represented as adjunctions that commute with the doubl=
e power locale monad and it is the double power locale monad that gives the=
  structure in categories of locales. So there are avenues worth exploring w=
hich may provide a way of marrying up the structural disconnect between obj=
ects and morphisms that is implicit in topos theory. =

The above is a quotation from a recent posting by Andre Joyal.  To the risk=
   of boring everyone I offer the following comment on it here. There is no =
need to talk about miracles in mathematics, not even as some sort of analog=
y. Why not instead give credit to the very important insight of an elementa=
ry topos as embodying both the logic and the geometry? There are two notion=
s  of morphism between elementary toposes, not a preferred one - the geomet=
ric and the logical. One structure - to wit that of an elementary topos, ca=
n be seen in two different ways depending on what the mathematical uses one=
  wants to give it. There is no confusion here  - just richness. Let me be m=
ore specific.


Thinking of an elementary topos S as the chosen "set theory", a Grothendiec=
k topos (including any category of the form Sh(X) for X a locale in S, but =
more generally as a category of sheaves on a site in S) can be recovered as=
   a pair (E, e) where E is another elementary topos and e: E -> S a bounded=
  geometric morphism. Thinking of elementary toposes from the logical point =
of view, and so of logical morphisms between them, there are other ideas an=
d  constructions that profit from this point of view - for instance a formu=
lation and proof of realizability by means of Artin-Wraith glueing.


Both the geometric and the logical are sides of the same coin. The notion o=
f an elementary topos (or "topos" for short) is simple yet powerful and unt=
il now it has served most of the mathematical purposes for which it was int=
ended and more.


Best wishes,

Marta
