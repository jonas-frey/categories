To count the bound variables in the context is a crudeness that loses
information. For example, it implies there are problem with (all) a.
TRUE(a) and (exists) a. FALSE(a). Both are in fact theorems in the empty
context.

To avoid any misunderstanding, it's not my approach to handling the
empty universe - it has been around for a long time, I believe it
originated with Mostowski, and it is present well in the Elephant D.

It relies on conducting each logical deductions within a specified
context that describes which free variables are available for use. A
theorem phi proved in context (a1, ..., an) is implicitly

   (all) a1...an. phi

To put it another way, when you quantify out to get a theorem in the
empty context, that is what it is.

The theorems

   TRUE(a)
   TRUE(a) --> (exists) x. TRUE(x)

can only be in a context that has at least a, and applying modus ponens
leaves us with

   (exists) x. TRUE(x)

as a theorem _in that same context_. It is wrong to say (exists) x.
TRUE(x) is a theorem without specifying the context. In the empty
context it becomes the theorem

   (all) a. (exists) x. TRUE(x)

All the best,

Steve.
