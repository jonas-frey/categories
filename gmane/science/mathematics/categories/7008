All right, somebody should answer...

Dear Dmitry,

First, may I suggest that looking at category theory as merely a
'generalized abelian category theory' is not really a good idea?

Specifically, in the abelian context

'right exact + preserves monos => left exact'

is simple but extremely important, while for general categories it is indeed
wrong, and adding conditions to make this work seems to be a strange thing
to do!

Now, more specifically, concerning Barr exact:

Let 2 be the ordered set {0,1} considered as a category, let S be the
category of sets, and let F : S --> 2 be the left adjoint of the canonical
embedding 2 --> S (hence, for a set X, F(X) = 0 if and only if X is empty).
Then:

(a) 2 and S are Barr exact.

(b) F preserves all colimits since it is a left adjoint.

(c) F preserves products (moreover, the fact that it preserves all products
is one of the standard forms of the Axiom of Choice).

(d) F preserves monomorphisms since every morphism in 2 is a monomorphism.

(e) F does not preserve all equalizers since two parallel morphisms between
non-empty sets might have the empty equalizer.

Best regards

George Janelidze
