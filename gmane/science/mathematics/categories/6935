Bill recalls:

My memory rather matches instead what I see in (3.2(d)) of Willard, =

that the topology with only the whole space and the empty set "open"
is called either 'trivial' or 'indiscrete'.

In my experience I've never encountered 'chaotic' as the
adjective used for that attribute -- indeed, 'chaotic' would have =

conflicted rather badly with the Chaos Theory arising out of Ren=E9 =

Thom's Catastrophe Theory of the early '60s or so -- and 'codiscrete' =

strikes me as what only a categorist hoping (as we many of us =

long did) to systematize terminology into dual camps of 'properties' =

and 'coproperties' (in the model of adjoint/coadjoint, limit/colimit, =

terminal/coterminal, etc.) could have come up with -- not a term any
self-respecting point-set topologist would have thought to use :-) .

'Codiscrete' of course does, for just that reason, have its merits,
as Bill points out:

And I object not one whit to any of that :-) .

This again suggests that 'chaotic' might not be the best choice of
adjective for that indiscrete/codiscrete topology, or the analogous
type of category, or groupoid, or topological category or groupoid.
