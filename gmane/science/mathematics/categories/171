The horizontal line notation was introduced by Gerhard Gentzen in his
logical sequent calculus. If a set of formulas S  implies a and b, then S
implies a/\b and vice-versa which was written as:

S |- a,b
______
S |- a/\b

Going from top to bottom was conjunction-introduction, and going in the
other direction was conjunction-elimination. After Lawvere noted that these
Gentzen rules were simple adjunctions, he started writing all adjunctions
using this Gentzen-style notation with the two adjoint transposes on top and
on bottom and the arrow replacing the turnstile ( |- ) symbol. The notation
caught on.

Subject: categories: Horizontal line notation.

Lawvere & Schanuel use a horizontal line notation.  Page 326 for example.

X --> 1^T
---------
TxX --> 1

This is unfamiliar.  Does the line have a name?  How is it read?  I'll guess
either "(X --> 1^T) is equivalent to (TxX --> 1)"
or
"(X --> 1^T) is isomorphic to (TxX --> 1)".

Thanks,     ... Peter E.
