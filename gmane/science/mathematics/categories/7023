Dear George,

Well, I find Barr's theorem useful insomuch as it highlights regular
monos as the relevant ones and thereby brings the situation into
sharper focus: proving the preservation of the equalizers of cokernel
pairs should be easier than arbitrary ones. Of course, characterizing
the regular monos and proving that they are preserved by cobase change
(I've finally remembered what A@- is called!) could be a difficult
matter, depending on the circumstances.

So, I thank everyone for the feedback. I will post here if I manage to
prove anything of interest.

Best,

Dmitry
