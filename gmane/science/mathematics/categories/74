You're assuming product distributes over sums, which would be true for
ordinary product but I specified lexicographic product, with the left
argument as the "high order digit" (converse of the usual convention for
ordinal product in ordinal arithmetic).  Why should {0} x N be a
complemented subobject of N x N  when lexicographic product attaches the
"end" of it to {1} x {0} , which I would expect it will in a topos of
sheaves when participating in a final coalgebra for N x X.
