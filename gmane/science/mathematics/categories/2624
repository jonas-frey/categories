I haven't yet digested the rest of Freyd's post, but all of the above,
including the notation x << y, the connection with collapsing maximal
Boolean intervals, the "historical" connection with Cantor, and a lot
more, can be found in a series of papers of Harold Simmons:

    H. Simmons, "The Cantor-Bendixson analysis of a frame", Seminaire
    de mathematique pure,  Rapport no. 92, Institut de Mathematique
    Pure, Universite Catholique de Louvain, January 1980.

    H. Simmons, "An algebraic version of Cantor-Bendixson analysis",
    in Categorial Aspects of Toplogy and Analysis, pp. 310-323,
    Springer LNM 915, 1982.

    H. Simmons, "Near-discreteness of modules and spaces as measured
    by Gabriel and Cantor", J. Pure and Appl. Alg. 56 (1989), 119-162.

    H. Simmons, "Separating the discrete from the continuous by
    iterating derivatives", Bull. Soc. Math. Belg. 41 (1989), 417-463.

The operation Freyd is calling s (and the associated relation <<)
arose in connection with the so-called Reflection Problem for Frames,
namely to characterize those frames that have a reflection into the
category of complete Boolean algebras.  When such reflections exist,
they can be found by iterating the functor A |-> N(A), which freely
complements the elements of A (and is also the frame of nuclei on A,
ordered pointwise), until it "terminates":

    A -> N(A) -> N^2(A) -> ... -> N^a(A) -> ...  (a in ORD).

(These maps are all both mono and epi and are components of natural
transformations between iterates of N).  A basic result here is that
N(A) is Boolean iff x << sx for all x in A.  The general reflection
problem remains open.
