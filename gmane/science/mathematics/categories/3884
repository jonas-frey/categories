I think it's not that.

It's just because the concept of internal category is in some sense subsumed
by the concept of fibration. And in practical situations we prefer to work
with fibrations rather than internal categories.

What do you mean by "you get internal/enriched categories" ? Do you have a
2-equivalence between the 2-category of all S-internal (resp. enriched)
categories (S-internal functors, S-internal natural transformations) and the
2-category of your categories ? I'm asking because I have encountered some
difficulties here (i.e. in my framework some diagrams are not willing to
commute "on the nose").
