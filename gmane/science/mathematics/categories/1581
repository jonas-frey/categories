  Bob: I've added a description of his dissertation, so use this if
  you haven't already sent the other out.



I thought it might be interesting to find out about Osher Doctorow.
Something called "Nupedia" lists him as one of its "very distinguished
and active scholars, and all-around interesting people" to be found
among its Editors and Peer Reviewers. Nupedia tells us:
                                            
  Osher Doctorow (PR) -- Ph.D. (1982 UCLA).  Consultant in mathematics
  and physics mostly since 1973, Doctorow Consultants, Culver City,
  California.  M.A.  Mathematics (USC 1969), M.A. Anthropology
  (University of London 1961). Over 150 papers presented and
  publications, about 40 of which abstracted at Instititute for Logic
  at University of Vienna on the internet, plus (in addition to the
  150 or so above) about 40 book reviews on math and physics mostly,
  at Amazon.com. Taught university mathematics five years; Staff
  Research Assistant (statistics) UCLA six years; Mathematician U.S.

  and Electronics Association (AFCEA), UCLA Alumni Association
  (lifetime). Married 30+ years to Dr. Marleen Josie Doctorow

PsycINFO tells us:
