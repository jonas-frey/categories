A natural transformation is an indexed family of arrows such that a
certain diagram commutes. One could require a stronger condition,
namely that the said diagram is a pullback. What would such a
transformation be called? I'm sure I've seen this in the literature
before but I cant remember where. Pointers?

This problem arose in the context of finitary monads where 
T(X) is the derived operations over a set X for some signature. 
The naturality square for the unit turns out to be a pullback. 
This then implies that the unit of the monad is a monic - 
presumably this is a result in the literature somewhere. 
Again, pointers?
