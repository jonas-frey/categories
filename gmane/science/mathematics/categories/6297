The 22nd International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and
Applications (RTA 2011) is organized as part of the Federated
Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming (RDP 2011),
together with the International Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and
Applications (TLCA 2011), and several workshops.  RDP 2011 will be
held at the University of Novi Sad, Serbia.

IMPORTANT DATES:

Abstract Submission:  January 7, 2011 (Friday)

Paper Submission:     January 14, 2011 (Friday)

Notification:         March 4, 2011 (Friday)

Final version:        April 3, 2011 (Sunday)

Conference:           May 30, 2011 (Monday)

RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects
of rewriting. Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited
to):

* Applications: case studies; analysis of cryptographic protocols;
   rule-based (functional and logic) programming; symbolic and
   algebraic computation; theorem proving; system synthesis and
   verification; proof checking; reasoning about programming languages
   and logics; program transformation; XML queries and transformations

* Foundations: matching and unification; narrowing; completion
   techniques; strategies; rewriting calculi; constraint solving; tree
   automata; termination; complexity; combination;

* Frameworks: string, term, and graph rewriting; lambda-calculus and
   higher-order rewriting; constrained rewriting/deduction; categorical
   and infinitary rewriting; integration of decision procedures; net
   rewriting; binding techniques;

* Implementation: implementation techniques; parallel execution;
   rewrite tools; termination checking; abstract machines; explicit
   substitutions;

* Semantics: equational logic; rewriting logic; rewriting models of
   programs.

INVITED SPEAKERS:
Ashish Tiwari (SRI,USA) and Sophie Tison (Univ. Lille and LIFL, France)=

will be invited speakers at RTA.

BEST PAPER AWARD:
A prize of 500 Euro will be given to the best paper as judged by the
program committee. The program committee may decline to make the award
or may split it among several papers.

PUBLICATION:
RTA proceedings will be published by LIPIcs (Leibniz International
Proceedings in Informatics). LIPIcs is open access, meaning that
publications will be available online and free of charge, and authors
keep the copyright for their papers.  LIPIcs publications are indexed
in DBLP.  STACS, FSTTCS and ICLP proceedings also appear in LIPIcs.
See
   http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics =

for more information about LIPIcs.

Printed proceedings of RTA will be provided to the participants at the =

conference.

SUBMISSIONS:
Submissions must be original and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Submissions must fall into one of the following categories
(to be indicated in the title page):

1. Regular research Papers: describing new results; they will be
    judged on correctness and significance.

2. Experience papers: describing the experience of applying rewriting
    techniques in other areas; they will be judged on relevance and
    comparison with other approaches.

3. Problem sets that provide realistic and interesting challenges in
    the field of rewriting.

4. System descriptions; they should contain a link to a working system
    and will be judged on usefulness and design.

All submissions will be judged on originality and quality of
presentation. Submissions in the first three categories can be up to
15 proceedings pages long, system descriptions up to 10 proceedings
pages.  Additional material, for instance proof details, may be given
in an appendix which is not subject to the page limit.  However,
submissions must be self-contained within the respective page limit;
reading the appendix should not be necessary to assess the merits of a
submission.

Abstracts and papers must be submitted electronically through the
EasyChair system at:

  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Drta2011

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:
Submitted works are limited to 15 pages, including references.  An
appendix may or may not be part of the submission, which will not be
included in the proceedings. Submissions must use the LaTeX class
lipics.cls, and should take the information on the LaTeX formatting
into acount. LaTeX files and formatting information is available for
download at http://www.rdp2011.uns.ac.rs/rta/index.html

Questions concerning submissions may be addressed to the PC chair,
Manfred Schmidt-Schauss <schauss "AT" ki.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de>.
