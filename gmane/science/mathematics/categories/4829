When I took a graduate course in probability, my lecturer began with =0Aa r=
ather fine speech about the relationship between probability and =0A(finite=
) measure theory; in it, he discouraged identifying the two.  =0AHis point =
was that, insofar as probabilistic phenomena occur in the =0Areal world, no=
 mathematical theory can aspire to do more than model =0Aprobability---and =
that, while (finite) measure theory has been very =0Asuccessful at modellin=
g probability, it also has shortcomings.=0A=0AIntrigued, I sought him out l=
ater for more thoughts on the subject.=0AIn the ensuing conversation, I gat=
hered two tidbits of information=0Awhich readers of the list may appreciate=
: that Gromov believes that =0Athe future of probability theory lies in bic=
ategory theory; and that =0Adiscontent with measure theory stems, at least =
in part, from its =0Afailure to adequately handle conditional probabilities=
.  =0A=0ATo be honest, the latter point heartened me even more than the fir=
st.=0AFrom a purely aesthetic point of view, it has always irked me that on=
e =0Acan meaningfully assign probabilities to things which are not events;=
=0AI interpret this as meaning that the (standard) notion of event is too =
=0Anarrow.  Of course, it is also the case that the (standard) formula =0Af=
or a conditional probability may result in the indeterminate 0/0, so =0Ait =
would seem that [0,1] is also too small a codomain for the map =0A"probabil=
ity", even classically understood (i.e., not getting into the=0A"free proba=
bility" of Voiculescu). =0A=0ACheers,=0AJeff.=0A=0A----- Original Message -=
