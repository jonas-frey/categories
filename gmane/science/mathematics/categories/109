Toby, thanks for that.  Peter J. suggested a proof in a separate email
to me, let me absorb and compare them.

Quite right, I forgot to specify that s and t were monotone (which
implies inflationary), and I also left out that 0 is the empty sup.=20
(According to J&M in "Algebraic Set Theory" 1995, specifying=20
inflationary rather than monotone for the class as a whole gives the=20
hereditarily transitive sets, i.e. the von Neumann ordinals.  Monotone=20
gives a larger class and a weaker notion of ordinal which nonetheless is=20
inflationary as a consequence of monotonicity and initiality.)

The conditions I forgot to mention, 0 <=3D x and t monotone, should give=20
t^2(0) <=3D t^2(s(0)).

If both coordinates still have complemented subobjects, in particular if=20
{0} x w and w x {0} are both complemented subobjects, then I should=20
throw in the towel, consistent with Peter's advice.  Are they?  If w x=20
{0} is not a complemented subobject then we're moving in the right=20
direction: the next step is to define a suitable final coalgebra.
