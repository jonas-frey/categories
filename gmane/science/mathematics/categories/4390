Dear Michael,

Let C be the category of commutative rings (with 1), let t be the unique
positive real number with tttt = 2 (if I knew TeX better, I would probably
write t^4 = 2), and E be the smallest subfield in the field of real numbers
that contains t. Then:

(a) Every power of E has exactly one element x such that xx = 2 and there
exists y with x = yy. Let us call this x the positive square root of 2.

(b) Every morphism between powers of E preserves the positive square root of
2.

(c) Therefore every equalizer of two arrows between powers of E has an
element x with xx = 2 (note that I am not saying anything about the
existence of y, since y above is not determined uniquely!).

(d) Therefore the field Q of rational numbers cannot be presented as an
equalizer of two arrows between powers of E.

(e) On the other hand Q can be presented as an equalizer of two arrows
between two objects in C that are equalizers of two arrows between powers of
E. Indeed: the equalizer of the identity morphism of E and the unique
non-identity morphism of E is the subfield D in E generated by tt (which is
just the square root of 2); and the equalizer of the identity morphism of D
and the unique non-identity morphism of D is Q.

(f) This also gives negative answer to the question about "internally
complete", since no arrow of our subcategory composed with the two morphisms
D ---> D above will give the same result.

This story is of course based on the fact that there are Galois field
extensions L/K and M/L, for which M/K is not a Galois extension.

Best regards, George
