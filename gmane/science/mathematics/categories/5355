Had it been really  *done*?  It may be just in "the nature of things"
when a community A provides abstract models for community B. Something
similar appears in relations between physicists and mathematicians, or
between physicists/computer scientists and engineers.

When a mathematician is building a math model for some physical
theory, his main driving force is a question "What do they *really*
do?"  As the work is progressing, the question develops into a thesis
"they don't actually understand what they do", and with this attitude,
the mathematician finally brings something structurally neat to
physicists. In a typical good case, the reaction would be like Manin
recently formulated in his interview "we always knew that but thank
you for attention". In a bad case, ... you know.

Isn't it similar to the math vs.category theory case?  For some people
structural clarity and elegance is a matter of life and death, for
others it's a dispensable luxury (it's a rephrasing of Edsger Dijkstra
if I remember right).
