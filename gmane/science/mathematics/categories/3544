Dear Marta,


I fully agree with your suggestion concerning the numerous journals that
you mentioned. Having a free on-line version of these journalist would
certainly be efficient in solving the problem of access to knowlwdge,
which is indeed very important. (My understanding is that the topic of
arms trade was closed on this mailing list!)

On the shorter run, however, I propose creating an off-shore website,
which is outside the reach of US/Canadian/European courts.  The declared
intent of this website would be to violate the copyright laws by
downloading the ready PDF files from ScienceDirect through the library
access that we have, and uploading it to this site -- which makes them
freely available for anyone interested. The idea would be to accept
anonymous uploads, and thus share the burden (and liablity) for
maintaining the site.

I think it would be much harder to fight the overpriced publishers if we
followed all the laws and rules. These laws were made to *maintain* and
*stabilize* the current situation, and not to help those who want a
change.

> Something must be done. That much is clear.

The problem is that profit is a very good organizer, while getting
volunteers is never easy. I would be quite interested in hearing the
history of TAC, how it started, etc.

Best wishes,

Gabi
