A short note: This idea that string diagrams are, due to technical
issues, only useful for private calculation, is said explicitly by
Penrose. Penrose and Rindler's book "Spinsors and Spacetime" (CUP
1984) has an 11-page appendix full of all sorts of beautiful,
carefully hand-drawn graphical notation for tensors and various
operations on them (e.g. anti-symmetrization and covariant
derivative). On the second page, he says the following:

"The notation has been found very useful in practice as it grealy
simplifies the appearance of complicated tensor or spinor equations,
the various interrelations expressed being discernable at a glance.
Unfortunately the notation seems to be of value mainly for private
calculations because it cannot be printed in the normal way."


Best,

Aleks
