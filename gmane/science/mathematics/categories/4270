Jeff did not mention the excellent very categorical lectures given on=20=20=
=0A=
operator spaces by Matthias Neufang at the=0A=
FIELDS INSTITUTE=0A=
Summer School in Operator Algebras=0A=
held last summer at the University of Ottawa and that we both=20=20=0A=
attended. I do not know if any version of Matthias' notes is=20=20=0A=
available.  The theme of tensor products was important.  Not only did=20=20=
=0A=
his lectures provide good motivation for studying the subject from a=20=20=
=0A=
categorical viewpoint.  He did not do the category theory of operator=20=20=
=0A=
spaces but rather was explicitly conscious of the categorical content=20=20=
=0A=
of what he was saying.  His notes may be of some interest to others so=20=
=20=0A=
let us hope he will put some of the material on the web.=0A=
