Scope
-----
The workshop METHODS FOR MODALITIES (M4M) aims to bring together
researchers interested in developing algorithms, verification methods
and tools based on modal logics. Here the term "modal logics" is
conceived broadly, including temporal logic, description logic,
guarded fragments, conditional logic, temporal and hybrid logic, etc.

To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will feature
a number of invited talks by leading scientists, research
presentations aimed at highlighting new developments, and submissions
of system demonstrations.

More information about the previous editions can be found at

                       http://m4m.loria.fr/


Autumn School
-------------
M4M-6 will be preceded by a two-day mini-course called "Autumn School
on Modal Logic" aimed at preparing PhD students and other researchers
for participation in the workshop. The autumn school will be taught
by Carlos Areces, Patrick Blackburn, Valentin Goranko, Renate Schmidt,
and Carsten Sch=FCrmann. Consult the autumn school home page for further
information:

              http://hylocore.ruc.dk/m4m6school.html

The autumn school is associated with the FIRST research school
(http://first.dk).


Registration
------------
