This is something of an answer to question 2).  I was very influenced by

Streicher, T. =E2=80=98Fibred categories `a la B=C2=B4enabou=E2=80=99.
http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/=E2=88=BCstreicher/ (1999) 1=E2=80=
=9385.
to see how useful fibrations and cofibrations of categories for giving=20
the abstract background to constructions that occurred commonly in my=20
work with Higgins and Loday on nonabelian colimit constructions in =20
homotopy theory. So Sivera and I put these in Appendix B of the book=20
"Nonabelian Algebraic Topology" (EMS 2011) (NAT).  Note that Higgins=20
pioneered in effect the use of the functor Ob: Groupoids \to Sets as a=20
cofibration of categories, (see his Notes on Categroies and Groupoids"=20
TAC Reprint) and Section B.3 of NAT gives suitable general results as=20
background to say colimits of groupoids, knowing them for sets.

There is more sophisticated material in the above lectures which I have=20
not managed to use.  Any advice on this could be useful!
