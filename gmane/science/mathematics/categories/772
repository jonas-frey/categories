           *********   Second Announcement   *********

       The 68th Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic
                       August 29-30, 1998 
                      Brno, Czech Republic



   The 68th meeting of the PSSL will be held at the Masaryk
University, Brno, Czech Republic over the weekend of 29-30
August 1998. It is organized in connection with the federated
conferences MFCS (Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science)
and CSL (Computer Science Logic) which are taking place in Brno
during August 23-28, 1998. There are other workshops related to
MFCS\CSL and participants interested to stay in Brno the whole
week may contact Jan Staudek (staudek@fi.muni.cz).
   As usual, the 68th meeting of the PSSL will be informal in
nature and it will be focused on category theory, logic and
theoretical computer science.
   We have arranged an accommodation in a student dormitory
(single rooms, for 2 nights since Friday to Sunday) together with
breakfasts and lunches in a university restaurant. The cost is 80$.
Participants wishing to stay in hotels should contact Jan Staudek.
   Brno is located about 200 km south-east of Prague and 130 km
north of Vienna and it can be reached from the both airports by
trains and buses. More details will be available in the last
announcement. We will maintain a www-page containing all
informations.
   To register, please fill out the form below and return it
(preferably by e-mail) to Jan Paseka till August 12.
   This deadline is important as afterwards we cannot guarantee 
an accommodation.
   Looking forward to meeting you in Brno.
