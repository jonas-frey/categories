Clarification:

Alex Simpson points out, in a reply not sent to the list, that in the
ambient category of topological spaces, compact Hausdorff spaces are
not exponentiating. For example the exponential 2^(N^N) doesn't exist,
where 2 is the two-point discrete space and N is the discrete space of
natural numbers, and, of course, the exponential N^N does exist. In
fact, Alex emphasized this years ago, when I subjected him to the
ideas presented in the previous message.

The point is that the locale product of two (sober) topological spaces
doesn't coincide with the topological product, and hence exponentials
are potentially different, as they are defined with respect to
products.

You may say: well, in any case, it is a fact that a sober space is
exponentiable in Top iff it is exponentiable in Loc, so Alex's
counter-example should work in Loc too.  But then I reply: this
coincidence has to do with the fact that the locale product coincides
with the topological product if one of the factors is locally
compact. In our case, because the exponent is NOT necessarily locally
compact, this coincidence fails. We are considering exponentiating
rather than exponentiable spaces. So, in principle, it may be that
compact Hausdorff locales are exponentiating in Loc - although I very
much doubt that this would be the case, as should be clear from the
previous message. The point is that I just don't know, and I am
looking forward to be enlightened after my failed attempts to decide
the question either way.

In light of Alex's observation, my conclusion to the previous message
should have been:

> Question 3. But surely compact Hausdorff locales cannot possibly be
> exponentiating, can they?

One further comment: it is plausible that eta: X->JX is stably flat
for X exponentiable. If Alex's topological counter-example applies to
locales, then eta_X is not stably flat for X=N^N.
