Hi,

Nice question. A paradox is the final word about some assumption. Since =
it is the final word, we say it is a theorem.=20

Here is what I what I wrote in "The Outer Limits of Reason: What =
Science, Mathematics, and Logic Cannot Tell Us":
"In a way, the paradox is a test to see if an assumption is a legitimate =
addition to reason. If one can use valid reason and the assumption to =
derive a falsehood, then the assumption is wrong. The paradox shows that =
we have stepped beyond the boundaries of reason. A paradox in this sense =
is a pointer to an incorrect view. It points to the fact that the =
assumption is wrong. Since the assumption is wrong, it cannot be added =
to reason. This is a limitation of reason."

For more, on paradoxes, please see

Since the Incompleteness Theorem uses the Liar Paradox, why is it called =
the Incompleteness Theorem and not the Incompleteness Paradox?

A Theorem closes a development or debate, and calls for admiration =
(because the inventor did something supposedly good), whereas a Paradox =
opens up development and debate (since the detector has pointed at =
something being wrong), and delays the call for admiration of the =
disruptively innovative solution until it is really deserved.

Best,

Patrik
