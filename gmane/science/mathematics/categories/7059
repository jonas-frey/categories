Dear Colleagues:

It is the 75th anniversary of the appearance of Alonzo Church's =
fundamental
article "An unsolvable problem of elementary number theory". This paper
introduced to a general mathematical audience the (untyped) lambda =
calculus as a
computational paradigm. This calculus has profoundly influenced not only =
the foundations of
computer science but also a wide range of areas, including category =
theory (via cartesian closed=20
categories), logic and linguistics.

There will be a one-day celebratory workshop June 15, 2012 at the =
University of
St. Andrews, Scotland, as part of the 2012 Symposium on Trends in =
Functional
Programming.   Here is the workshop webpage: =
http://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/lambda2012/

Keynote speakers include:  H. Barendregt (Nijmegen),   C. Hankin =
(Imperial),=20
F. Kamareddine (Heriot-Watt ), G. Plotkin  (Edinburgh). In addition to =
the keynote speakers,=20
there is a call for workshop papers on any topic relevant to the life =
and work of Alonzo Church. =20
Deadline for submissions is 27 January, 2012.   See the workshop webpage =
for further details.
