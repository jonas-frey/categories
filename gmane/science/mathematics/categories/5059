Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished
research on theoretical aspects of computer science. Typical areas
include (but are not limited to):

* Algorithms and data structures, including: parallel and distributed =20=

algorithms,
  computational geometry, cryptography, algorithmic learning theory;
* Automata and formal languages;
* Computational and structural complexity;
* Logic in computer science, including: semantics, specification,
   and verification of programs, rewriting and deduction;
* Current challenges, for example: biological computing,
   quantum computing, mobile and net computing.

SUBMISSIONS
*******************
Authors are invited to submit a draft of a full paper with at most 12
pages (STACS style or similar - e.g. LaTeX article style, 11pt a4paper).
The title page must contain a classification of the topic covered,
preferably using the list of topics above. The paper should contain a
succinct statement of the issues and of their motivation, a summary of
the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance,
accessible to non-specialist readers. Proofs omitted due to space
constraints must be put into an appendix to be read by the program
committee members at their discretion. Submissions deviating from these
guidelines risk rejection. Electronic submissions should be formatted
in PostScript or PDF.Simultaneous submission to other conferences
with published proceedings is not allowed.

PROCEEDINGS
********************
Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the Symposium, which =20=

are published electronically in the LIPIcs
(Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics) series, available =20
through Dagstuhl's website.
The LIPIcs series provides an ISBN for the proceedings volume and =20
manages the indexing issues.
Accepted papers will also be archived in the open access electronic =20
repositories HAL and arXiv.
These gateways, as well as the LIPIcs series, guarantee perennial, =20
free and easy electronic access,
while the authors will retain the rights over their work.
With their submission, authors consent to sign a license authorizing =20
the program committee chairs to organize
the electronic publication of their paper if it is accepted.
Further details are available on www.stacs-conf.org and on the =20
conference website.
Participants of the conference will receive a printed version of the =20
proceedings.
It is also planned to publish in a journal a selection of papers.


IMPORTANT DATES
