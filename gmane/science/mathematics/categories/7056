Dear all,

In "Formal Category Theory: Adjointness for 2-Categories", Gray =20
introduces what is now known as the Gray tensor product. The =20
following two questions concern the part I,4.23, Appendix A, p.92-95, =20=

where Gray relates the aforesaid product to a universal construction =20
due to B=E9nabou. (I shall send a PDF version of what follows for those =20=

averse to e-mails swarming with dollar symbols.) In the following, =20
all the 2-categories are strict.

1. Given a 2-category $A$, Gray, refering to B=E9nabou unpublished =20
notes, gives a description of a couple $(\widetilde{A}, P)$ where $=20
\widetilde{A}$ is a 2-category and $P : A \to \widetilde{A}$ a lax =20
functor (oplax in Gray's text, but I take the liberty to take the lax =20=

viewpoint and translate everything accordingly) which has the =20
following universal property: for any 2-category $B$ and any lax 2-=20
functor $F : A \to B$, there is a unique strict 2-functor $\widetilde=20
{F} : \widetilde{A} \to B$ such that $\widetilde{F}P=3DF$. I have =20
trouble in understanding the description with which Gray goes on, but =20=

I believe it is equivalent to the following one, which I have learnt =20
from Matias del Hoyo:

The objects of $\widetilde{A}$ are those of $A$;

If $a$ and $a'$ are two objects of $\widetilde{A}$, then the 1-cells =20
from $a$ to $a'$ in $\widetilde{A}$ are the couples $([m], (x) : [m] =20
\to A)$, where $m$ is a nonnegative integer, $[m]$ denotes the =20
category associated to the ordinal $m$, and $(x) : [m] \to A$ is a 2-=20
functor such that $(x)(0)=3Da$ and $(x)(1)=3Da'$, in other words $(x)$ =20=

can be viewed as a chain linking $a$ to $a'$ of 1-cells of $A$ (we do =20=

not require the chain to be nondegenerate, so identities are allowed =20
in it);

If $a$ and $a'$ are two objects of $\widetilde{A}$ and $([m], (x) : =20
[m] \to A)$ and $([n], (y) : [n] \to A)$ are two 1-cells from $a$ to =20
$a'$ in $\widetilde{A}$, then the 2-cells from $([m], (x))$ to $([n], =20=

(y))$ in $\widetilde{A}$ are the n+1-uples $(\varphi, \alpha_{1}, =20
ldots, \alpha_{n})$, where $\varphi : [n] \to [m]$ is a morphism =20
between partially ordered sets (we do not require it to be injective) =20=

such that, for every $i$ in $[n]$, we have $x_{\varphi(i)} =3D y_{i}$, =20=

and where $\alpha_{i}$ is a 2-cell of $A$ from $x_{\varphi(i), \varphi=20=

(i)-1} \circ \ldots \circ x_{\varphi(i-1)+1, \varphi(i-1)}$ to $y_{i, =20=

i-1}$ for $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. ($x_{i+1,i}$ stands for the image =20=

of the arrow $i \to i+1$ by $(x)$.)

The first question I have is: does this explicit description appear =20
in the literature somewhere else than Gray's book? Is there a =20
detailed proof of the universal property written down to which I =20
could refer? I confess having too much difficulties in understanding =20
Gray's book not to hope that someone will point out a more concrete =20
and modern treatment in the literature. (In fact, I even have trouble =20=

in convicing myself that the description just given is equivalent to =20
that given by Gray, one of the reason being the terminological =20
discrepancy between Gray's words and current usage.)

2. Gray goes on by relating the Gray tensor product to this universal =20=

construction. Given two 2-categories $A$ and $B$, I would like to =20
understand the relationship between the 2-category $\widetilde{A =20
\times B}$ ("tilde construction" of the cartesian product of $A$ and =20
$B$) and the Gray tensor product $A \otimes B$ of $A$ and $B$. I =20
suspect there is some kind of "localization" 2-functor relating these =20=

two 2-categories. What is the more concrete description of this =20
canonical 2-functor? Once again, pointers to the literature are =20
welcome. I would like to stress that I am not at all interested in =20
restricting the description to the pseudo case of the Gray tensor =20
product, I really want to deal with the general lax case.

Thanks in advance!

Jonathan=
