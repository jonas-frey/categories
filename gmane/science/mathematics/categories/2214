The situation appears to me as follows.
I those toposes where IZF (intuitionistic Zermelo Fraenkel set theory) is
available (as e.g. Grothendieck and realizability toposes) business is as
usual for functors preserving \omega-colimits: you simply construct mu(F) as
colim_{n \in \omega} F^n(0). Notice, however, that there is a tacit appeal
to the axiom of replacement when constructing the family (F^n(0))_{n\in\omega}.
In general there is no reason why this family should exist. Of course, for the
above mentioned examples like lists, trees etc. you can construct such
inductive data types because both List(A) and Tree(A) appear as inductively
defined subsets of P(\tilde{A}^N) where \tilde{A} is the partial map
classifier. The reason is that trees and lists over A can be coded as partial
maps from N to A.
The point is that toposes (due to their impredicative nature) support inductive
definitions of predicates on a type A given in advance. However, they don't
support construction of inductively defined types as one cannot define
sufficiently many families of types.
It is not clear to me to which extent one can characterise those inductive
types that can be reduced to inductively defined predicates in HAH.
However, one knows that assuming W-types (`a la Martin-Loef) one can reduce
most inductive types to W-types in extensional type theory. As far as I
understand that's the reason why Moerdijk and Palmgren introduced lccc's with
W-types as sort of ``predicative toposes''.
