Dear Colleague:

We would like to bring the community up to date on the journal

     Logical Methods in Computer Science
     www.lmcs-online.org

We started this fully refereed, open access, free electronic journal in
January 2005, intending to create a high-level platform for publications
in all theoretical and practical areas in computer science involving
logical methods, taken in a broad sense. We are now on Issue 3 of Volume 5
(there are four issues a year). So far, we have received more than 350
submissions of which we have published 162. In addition to individual
submissions, our journal publishes special issues, e.g., of selected
papers of high-level international conferences such as LICS, IJCAR, CAV,
CSL, and RTA.

We are continuing actively to develop the journal. For example, we accept
survey articles, and are developing `live' surveys, which can be
continually updated as knowledge progresses. In another direction, we are
considering allowing authors to provide additional material of an
expository nature, such as slides and videos, to enable them to interest a
wider spectrum of readers in their contribution.

The journal is an overlay of CoRR, the computer science repository of
arXiv. There are no fees for authors nor for readers. Every paper is
refereed by two or more referees, and high standards are applied. The
editorial board consists of about sixty top specialists in all areas of
logic in computer science.

The journal is covered by Mathematical Reviews, the ISI Web of Knowledge,
and the DBLP Database.

We welcome your comments and suggestions, and we seek your contributions!
