                    SCHOOL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
                   THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM
                             England


                     Three Lecturership Posts


Applications are invited for three lectureship posts in Computer
Science, starting as soon as possible (September 2001 latest).

Postholders will be expected to contribute strongly to research,
teaching and administration within the School. As an exception,
consideration will be given for one of the posts to applicants whose
strength is mainly in teaching in an area of special benefit to the
School, for example systems analysis, software design, information
systems, human-computer interaction or natural computation (taken to
include evolutionary, neurally-inspired, and other nature-based
computational styles).

We intend one of the positions to be filled by someone able to
contribute to teaching in our new EPSRC-funded MSc in Natural
Computation.

Applicants may be in any area of research in computational science.
Generally, applicants should have, or soon expect to have, a PhD in
computer science or an appropriate, closely related field, together
with research experience as evidenced by publications in leading
international journals or conference proceedings.  However,
teaching-orientated applicants may be acceptable if they have an
appropriate, strong educational or industrial background and have a
good university degree in an appropriate field.
