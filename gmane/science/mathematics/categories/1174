       Australasian Workshop on Computational Logic, AWCL
           Australian National University, Canberra
                     February 3-4, 2000
 
                      Call for Papers
 
 
 A workshop on Computational Logic will take place during the
 Australasian Computer Science Week at the Australian National
 University in February, 2000.
 
 The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers
 who have common interests in Computational Logic. While the
 workshop is particularly aimed at researchers in Australasia,
 anyone interested from elsewhere is strongly encouraged to
 submit a paper or to attend.
 
 Papers on all aspects of the theory, implementation, and
 application of Computational Logic are invited, where
 Computational Logic is to be understood broadly as the use of
 logic in Computer Science.
