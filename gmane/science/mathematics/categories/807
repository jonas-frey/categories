There is 1 with primary category CT and 7 cross-listed into CT in
1998.  A second CT paper dated 1995 is from the migration of the MSRI
preprint series.  Jim's table, which was forwarded from xxx staff,
counts only primary submissions, to avoid double-counting.  You can get a
clear picture at

    http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.CT

I should say that the main consequences so far of creating CT has been
a lot of theorizing about the categories in the xxx mathematics archive.
Perhaps that's a natural response from category theorists, but it's not
what the people who created CT had in mind.
