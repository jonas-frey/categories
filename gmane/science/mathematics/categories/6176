If one tries to define fibrationhood as a property of functors, "P : XX =
--> BB is a fibration", then indeed talking about equality of objects =
seems unavoidable.  The problem is exactly turning the object part  F : =
ob XX ---> ob BB  into a function  ob BB ---> Sets.

But if instead we define a set of "fibrations over BB", then we can do =
it:

a fibration over BB is a function  ob BB ---> Sets, together with etc. =
etc.  (I gave more details in a post on June 2, answering a similar =
question.)

Now, in classical foundations, this is (1-)equivalent to the usual =
definition.  Within a dependent type theory foundation, they are only =
rather more weakly equivalent; and in that case I'd hazard that =
something along these lines is a more natural/fruitful definition.


Digressing a little further, a similar situation arises for many other =
classes of maps that are viewed as "fibrations" or some sort: in a =
dependently-typed foundation, it's often more natural to consider a type =
of "fibrations over B", which then have "total spaces" that are maps =
into B, rather than defining "f is a fibration" as a property of maps.  =
The most fundamental case is just in Sets, with (classically) "all maps =
are fibrations": in a dependent system, a "fibration over B" is a =
function B --> Sets, which may not be quite the same as a map E --> B.
