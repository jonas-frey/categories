The concluding paragraph of the conclusion, on page 37, reads as follows.

"Kurt G=F6del provided innovative but convoluted proofs of some normal=20
properties of a simple recurrence relation, accompanied by spectacular=20
misinterpretations. G=F6del=92s incompleteness conjectures have beguiled=20
generations of readers lost in the sea of his complex proofs; his=20
unwarranted conclusions have smashed mathematical reason against the=20
petrified relics of ancient misunderstandings. But other thinkers have=20
seen more clearly; most importantly George Boole, whose brilliant=20
synthesis of algebra and logic has shown the way to modern computer=20
science. Perhaps it is time to raise the lamp in Boole=92s lighthouse, an=
d=20
to let the beacon of unified mathematics and logic guide a renewed quest=20
for the rational understanding of our world."

Let's go through this point by point.

1.  "...convoluted proofs..."  G=F6del's 1931 paper was 25 pages.=20
Norman's is 48.  Sounds like a pot calling the kettle black.

2.  "G=F6del=92s incompleteness conjectures have beguiled generations of=20
readers lost in the sea of his complex proofs..."  Evidently Norman is=20
one of those readers, since he appears to have mistaken a legitimate=20
proof for a conjecture.

3.  "But other thinkers have seen more clearly; most importantly George=20
Boole, whose brilliant synthesis of algebra and logic has shown the way=20
to modern computer science."  Since Boole's book predated G=F6del's proof=
=20
by 77 years, Norman's implication would seem to be that logicians=20
including G=F6del had failed to grasp Boole's deep insights throughout=20
that period, and furthermore throughout the following 80 years up to the=20
present, obliging Norman to bring them to light.

Similar logic would show that Newton invented quantum mechanics on the=20
basis of his corpuscular theory of light.

If there is any legitimate point in Norman's article, it would be along=20
the lines of Kripke's semantics of the liar paradox (to which Haim=20
Gaifman had a nice follow-up).  Norman may well have rediscovered=20
Kripke's insight, but in that case he should either discuss the=20
connection or explain why his references make a reference to Kripke=20
unnecessary.  Boole himself is not sufficient for that purpose because=20
arithmetic mod 2 did not occur to him as a model of his axioms.
