ICTAC is an International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of
Computing founded by the International Institute for Software
Technology of the United Nations University (UNU-IIST). The aim of the
colloquium is to bring together practitioners and researchers from
academia, industry and government to present research results, and
exchange experience, ideas, and solutions for their problems in
theoretical aspects of computing. Beyond these scholarly goals,
another main purpose of the conference is to promote cooperation in
research and education between participants and their institutions,
from developing and industrial countries, as in the mandate of the
United Nations University. The previous three ICTAC events were held
in Guiyang, China (2004), Hanoi, Vietnam (2005), Tunis, Tunisia
(2006).

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:
  - automata theory and formal languages
  - principles and semantics of programming languages
  - logics and their applications
  - software architectures and their description languages
  - software specification, refinement, and verification
  - model checking and theorem proving
  - formal techniques in software testing
  - models of object and component systems
  - coordination and feature interaction
  - integration of formal and engineering methods
  - service-oriented development
  - models of concurrency, security, and mobility
  - theory of parallel, distributed, and internet-based (grid) computing
  - real-time, embedded and hybrid systems
  - type and category theory in computer science
  - case studies
  - theories, tools and experiments of verified systems
  - integration of theories of system development and their tool support

ICTAC 2007 will have a technical program for five days including a
two-day festschrift symposium dedicated to the 70th birthdays of
former UNU-IIST directors, Dines Bj=F8rner and Zhou Chaochen, and three
days for a conference. There will also be a training school in the
preceding week on topics of Domain Modelling and the Duration
Calculus, to which Dines Bj=F8rner and Zhou Chaochen have made
significant contribution.

Paper Submissions:

Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be
concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions
will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field,
technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the
conference. Papers should be written in English and not exceed 15
pages in LNCS format (see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html for details).

Proceedings of the previous editions of ICTAC were published by
Springer in the LNCS series. We plan to do the same this year. Best
papers will be selected from the accepted papers and their authors
invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue
of Formal Aspects of Computing.

Submission Procedure:

Further information and instruction about submission can be found at
the conference website http://www.iist.unu.edu/ictac07.
