Dear Bill,

It's not primarily a matter of efficiency, but rather of expressiveness.

In a lazy language one can define an infinite list, pass it around as
a value, and access particular elements of it "on demand".

This demand-driven computation can be conceptually much cleaner than
trying to carefully plan, in advance, which values should be computed
in what order.

See, for example:

http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Performance/Laziness

http://lua-users.org/wiki/HammingNumbersVariant

Best,

Michael
