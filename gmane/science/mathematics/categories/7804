******************************************************************

-- ABOUT ETAPS --

ETAPS is the primary European forum for academic and industrial
researchers working on topics relating to software science. ETAPS,
established in 1998, is a confederation of six main annual
conferences, accompanied by satellite workshops. ETAPS 2014 is the
seventeenth event in the series.


-- MAIN CONFERENCES (7-11 April) --

* CC: Compiler Construction
* ESOP: European Symposium on Programming
* FASE: Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering
* FOSSACS: Foundations of Software Science
       and Computation Structures
* POST: Principles of Security and Trust
* TACAS: Tools and Algorithms for
       the Construction and Analysis of Systems

TACAS '14 hosts the 3rd Competition on Software Verification
(SV-COMP).


-- INVITED SPEAKERS --

* Robert Harper (Carnegie Mellon University, US)
* John Launchbury (Galois, US)
* Benoit Dupont de Dinechin (Kalray, France)
* Maurice Herlihy (Brown University, US)
* Christel Baier (Technical University of Dresden, Germany)
* Petr Jancar (Technical Univ of Ostrava, Czech Republic)
* David Mazieres (Stanford University, US)
* Orna Kupferman (Hebrew University Jerusalem, Israel)


-- IMPORTANT DATES --

*  4 October  2013: Submission deadline for abstracts (strict)
* 11 October  2013: Submission deadline for full papers (strict)
* 20 December 2013: Notification of acceptance
* 17 January  2014: Camera-ready versions due

ESOP and FoSSaCS will use a rebuttal (author response) phase.


-- GENERAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION --

ETAPS conferences accept two types of contributions: research papers
and tool demonstration papers. Both types will appear in the
proceedings and have presentations during the conference. (TACAS has
more categories, see below.)

A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one
of the authors attends the conference to give the
presentation. Submitted papers must be in English presenting original
research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same
contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden. The
proceedings will be published in the Advanced Research in Computing
and Software Science (ARCoSS) subline of Springer's Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series.

Papers must follow the formatting guidelines specified by Springer at
the URL

   http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author
interface of the respective conference.

Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be
rejected immediately.


- Research papers

Different ETAPS 2014 conferences have different page limits.
Specifically, FASE, FOSSACS and TACAS have a page limit of 15 pages,
whereas CC, ESOP and POST allow at most 20 pages. Additional material
intended for the referees but not for publication in the final version
- for example, details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked
appendix that is not included in the page limit. ETAPS referees are at
liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without
them.

TACAS solicits not only regular research papers, but also case study
papers.


- Tool demonstration papers

Submissions should consist of two parts:

* The first part, at most 4 pages, should describe the tool
   presented. Please include the URL of the tool (if available) and
   provide information that illustrates the maturity and robustness of
   the tool. (This part will be included in the proceedings.)

* The second part, at most 6 pages, should explain how the
   demonstration will be carried out and what it will show, including
   screen dumps and examples. (This part will be not be included in the
   proceedings, but will be evaluated.)

ESOP and FOSSACS do not accept tool demonstration papers.

In addition to tool demonstration papers (max 6 pages in their case),
TACAS solicits also regular tool papers (max 15 pages) adhering to
specific instructions about content and organization.


-- SATELLITE EVENTS (5-6 April, 12-13 April) --

Around 20 satellite workshops will take place before and after the
main conferences. In addition, on 6 April, some tutorials on topics of
wide interest will be offered.


-- HOST CITY --

Located in the southeastern part of France, Grenoble is considered as
the capital of the Alps. Grenoble is surrounded by nature and high
mountains: down the Alps, Grenoble is the meeting point of two
important rivers, Drac and Isere. Grenoble has important historical
and gastronomic heritages. Leisure activities in breathtaking nature
are easily organizable and within short-distance. Grenoble is also a
major scientific center in Europe dedicated to high-tech technologies,
e.g., nano, micro, bio, and information technologies.


-- HOST INSTITUTION --

The event is organized by Universite Joseph Fourier. Located at the
heart of the Alps, in outstanding scientific and natural surroundings,
the Universite Joseph Fourier in Grenoble is a leading University of
Science, Technology and Health.
