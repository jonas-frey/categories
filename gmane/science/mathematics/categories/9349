Dear Mamuka,=0A=
=0A=
I am also puzzled with your examples of duality.=0A=
I would like to speculate on some aspects of it.=0A=
=0A=
The category of finite dimensional vector=0A=
spaces is the archtype of a self-dual category. =0A=
In a sense, vector spaces are showing up=0A=
in geometry as tangent spaces of smooth manifolds.=0A=
But the tangent space of a manifold at a point is =0A=
the "infinitesimal" structure of that maniifold at that point.=0A=
It seems that linear structures are showing up=0A=
naturally as infinitesimal structures. =0A=
=0A=
Stable categories are showing up =0A=
as infinitesimal structure of higher toposes:=0A=
   =0A=
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/tangent+%28infinity%2C1%29-category=0A=
=0A=
Of course, linear structures may also be obtained=0A=
by other means.=0A=
=0A=

=0A=
Alexander's example reminded me of something I always wanted to ask=0A=
somebody and never did, since it always felt too vague to me. But now I=0A=
thought - just ask.=0A=
=0A=
In at least five very different contexts that I know, one seeks for a=0A=
nice placement of some very non-self-dual category against the=0A=
background of another one, "less non-self-dual".=0A=
=0A=
In order of my increasing ignorance, these are:=0A=
=0A=
Presenting spaces/locales/frames as certain (co/)monoids in the=0A=
category of sup-lattices, which is as nicely self-dual as it ever gets.=0A=
=0A=
Extending the duality between discrete and compact abelian groups to=0A=
the self-dual category of locally compact abelian groups. There are=0A=
several closely related similar dualities, like e. g. the duality for=0A=
(locally?) linearly compact vector spaces by, I believe, Lefschetz. In=0A=
fact I think working with Banach or Hilbert spaces is largely motivated=0A=
by the desire to force infinite-dimensional vector spaces to behave more=0A=
like finite-dimensional ones, which form some of the nicest self-dual=0A=
categories.=0A=
=0A=
Passing from (unstable) to stable homotopy theory is in a sense forcing=0A=
some amount of self-duality. The main feature of stable categories is=0A=
that they are additive (i. e. finite coproducts are isomorphic to the=0A=
corresponding products) but also much more - e. g. most of homotopy=0A=
cartesian or cocartesian squares in such categories turn out to be=0A=
homotopy bicartesian; this in particular implies the crucial feature=0A=
that the adjunction between suspension and loop space functors becomes=0A=
an equivalence (in a homotopy bicartesian square like=0A=
=0A=
A -> 0=0A=
|    |=0A=
V    V=0A=
0 -> B=0A=
=0A=
A is (stably equivalent to) the loop space of B iff B is (stably=0A=
equivalent to) the suspension of A; more generally, in a similar square=0A=
=0A=
A -> 0=0A=
|    |=0A=
V    V=0A=
X -> B=0A=
=0A=
A is the fibre of X -> B iff B is the cofibre of A -> X, etc.)=0A=
=0A=
The context mentioned by Alexander, which triggered this post in the=0A=
first place - the phenomenon called limit-colimit coincidence: it seems=0A=
that imposing on some categories certain constructivity constraints=0A=
coming from computer science tends to imply certain amount of self-dual=0A=
features. Like, initial algebras for endofunctors become forced to=0A=
become isomorphic with final coalgebras for the same endofunctors. Or,=0A=
similarly, left adjoints to some functors to become isomorphic to right=0A=
adjoints to the same functors.=0A=
=0A=
In physics, it seems that the main motivation of various quantization=0A=
procedures is to achieve certain amount of self-duality. For example,=0A=
evolution of a physical system becomes time-reversible.=0A=
=0A=
It seems like in many cases such "self-dualization" can be formulated=0A=
in terms of forcing certain objects in certain monoidal categories to=0A=
become invertible but I don't know enough to tell more about it. In any=0A=
case I am aware of several works by category theorists which provide=0A=
appropriate formalism for such and similar constructions; the most=0A=
general formalism that I know is probably the Chu construction. But, if=0A=
I am not overlooking something obvious, I have only seen explanations of=0A=
*how* to "increase self-dual features", not *why* do these=0A=
self-dualization phenomena tend to occur in so many disparate contexts.=0A=
=0A=
Does anybody know any underlying *reasons*? Can this phenomenon be=0A=
explained by the mere fact that "linearizing" the problem makes life=0A=
easier at the expense of losing certain amount of information, or there=0A=
actually exist some deeply rooted principles that force self-dual=0A=
behavior in certain mathematical or physical circumstances?=0A=
=0A=
Sorry for this very vague and long post, but I am really eager to learn=0A=
about opinions of the category-theoretic community about this question=0A=
that I hardly ever managed to even formulate.=0A=
