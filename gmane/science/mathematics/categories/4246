This semester I am teaching rudimentary category theory at graduate
level. It is somewhat scary that I should be doing this, but other
faculty members do not seem to do much general category theory.

I have only few students (and they are very bright) but their areas of
research are quite diverse: discrete math/computer science, algebra,
algebraic topology, and functional analysis.

I can plenty motivate categories for discrete math and computer science,
with things like "initial algebras are inductive datatypes, final
coalgebras are coinductive (lazy) datatypes".

I also know enough general algebra to motivate algebraists with
tquestions like "What is an additive category with a single object?".
And we will study algebraic theories as well.

Algebraic topologists are self-motivated. Nevertheless, we'll do some
sheaves towards the end of the course.

But how do I show the fun in categories to a student of functional
analysis? I would like to give him a class project that he will find
close to his interests. The course is covering (roughly) the following
material: basic category theory (limits, colimits, adjoints, we
mentioned additive and enriched categories), Lawvere's algebraic
categories, monads (up to stating Beck's theorem and working out some
examples), basics of presheaves and sheaves with a slant toward
topology. There must be some functional analysis in there.

I would very much appreciate some suggestions.

Best regards,

Andrej
