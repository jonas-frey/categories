The older name for topology was "analysis situs", analysis of place.  Why=
=20
that was changed is unknown to me, but the topo- root is just Greek for=20
place and it would be a stretch to assume anything else without good=20
evidence.

A French mathematician named, IIRC, Jean Pont wrote a book called,=20
"L'Histoire de la topologie alg=E9brique avant Poincar=E9" that traces=20
topology, at least algebraic topologie to Euler's solution to the bridges=
=20
of K=F6nigsberg problem.  I think V-F+E =3D 2 came next.
