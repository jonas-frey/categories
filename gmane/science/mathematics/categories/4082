Dear Colleagues,

I agree with Dusko that it is much better to avoid any offensive
remarks and I agree with every word Marta says in what she calls her
"seems to be 14th" message. On the other hand, it really feels as
everyone is trying to argue against Jean, gently or less gently=85 and
then it is understandable if Jean's remarks become a bit (or more than
a bit) angry.

Removing "offensive", "against", and "angry", I think this discussion
was actually very useful since it gave new information on the history
of an important mathematical discovery (I essentially knew what Ross
said because I heard that from Ross before, but I did not know about
Jon's talk in 1967 mentioned by Bill).

Let me also add that [G. Janelidze and W. Tholen, Facets of descent I,
Applied Categorical Structures, Vol. 2, No 2, 1994, 245-281] refers
(for the "monadicity=3Ddescent") to both B=E9nabou and Roubaud and to
Beck. However: while the precise reference on the B=E9nabou-Roubaud
paper is given there, Beck's name is mentioned without any reference
to a paper (since as far as we knew he did not publish such a paper).

I also had feeling confirmed by this discussion that nobody really
remembers what exactly did Jon do, while the B=E9nabou-Roubaud paper is
available to everyone=85

George Janelidze
