I never heard of such an initiative or else I would have supported it and
volunteered to help. You may (or may not) recall that during many years I
sole-handedly edited the Reports of the Department of Mathematics and
Statistics, after Willie Moser stepped down from this job. It was a lot of
work for me, but I am afraid that it served little purpose. Had I known of
such an initiative (for a proper journal), I would have devoted my energy to
it rather than to the Reports. In the end it was the Department itself which
decided that there was no need for the Reports (and thus for me) any longer.

Just to set the record straight,
Marta
