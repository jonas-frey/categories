Dear colleagues,=C2=A0

Given the current pandemic situation, we regret to inform that the worksh=
op=C2=A0

=E2=88=9E-categories and their applications=C2=A0

to be held at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Bonn, Germany=C2=A0=
=C2=A0
on August 17-21, 2020, has had to change form.=C2=A0

Previously, it was scheduled to consist of four minicourses, eight=C2=A0=C2=

=A0
maintained at the same dates, but in an online form.=C2=A0

The minicourses are:=C2=A0

Minicourse 1: Models for homotopical higher categories, by Bergner,=C2=A0=
=C2=A0
Julie (University of Virginia)=C2=A0
Minicourse 2: Introduction to =E2=88=9E-operads by Haugseng, Rune (NTNU)=C2=
=A0
Minicourse 3: Higher Categories and Algebraic K-Theory by Nikolaus,=C2=A0=
=C2=A0
Thomas (WWU M=C3=BCnster)=C2=A0
Minicourse 4: Exodromy and compactifications of arithmetic schemes by=C2=A0=
=C2=A0
Barwick, Clark (University of Edinburgh)=C2=A0

All interested in attending should register via the website=C2=A0

https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/10159=C2=A0
