Hi all,

there are two simplicial sets which deserve the name of the nerve of a
(reduced) crossed complex C: one is the usual nerve, defined as

(NC)_n = Crs(\Pi\Delta^n,C)

where \Pi\Delta^n is the fundamental crossed complex of the filtered
space \Delta^n, the n-simplex, and the other is

\bar{W}TC

where T:Crs --> sGrp is half of the Dold-Kan correspondence for
crossed complexes. I would expect these to be homotopy equivalent, but
haven't seen a result like this written down.

This is analogous to recent results on nerves of strict 2-groups,
namely that \bar{W}NG is equivalent to N(BG) where BG is the
one-object 2-category associated to G.

I'm also looking for a reference for the result that a space is the
classifying space of a crossed complex if the universal covering space
is the product of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces.

Thanks,

David Roberts
