Responding to David Roberts contribution here (cf. infra) on
the axiom of replacement, or as Paul Halmos dubs it, the axiom =

of substitution, I think it instructive to have a gander at the =

discussion centering around its appearance on page 75 of Halmos'
Naive Set Theory (Springer UTM edition, ISBN 978-0-387-90092-6).

The point seems to be that, with it, one can parlay a purely
linguistic "bijection" between the various natural numbers, on =

the one hand, and the various iterated successors of the first
infinite ordinal {/omega} (whose existence the axiom of infinity
guarantees) into a full-fledged set, closed under successors
(the successor X+ of a set X is the union of X with the singleton
set whose only member is X, X+ =3D X {/union} {X}), with {/omega}
as member, and minimal with regards to those two features, ...
=2E.. along with a bijection between that and the natural numbers.

With that, one can then be assured of the existence of an ordinal
whose elements include (i) all the natural numbers, and (ii) all
the various finitely iterated successors of {/omega}, ordinal one
would be hard pressed to know exists as a set, absent that axiom.

Yes, it's a colimit of a *seeming* diagram of sets ... but it's
really not a *proper* diagram: there's something distinctly not
kosher, not halal, about it. It's as bad as a fibration over N,
with fiber over n being the n^th iterated successor of {/omega},
but without there being any actual total space over the base N.
(Thanks to Bill Lawvere for bring up this view of things.)

I hope my shining a bit of light into this fog has more lit up =

the road ahead than merely blinded us hapless drivers. =


Cheers, -- Fred
