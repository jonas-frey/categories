It depends on what you mean by "basic calculus".
Bishop would argue that he can do basic calculus just fine
using a constructive version of the mean value theorem.

This is not to say that you don't have an interesting question;
from the POV of the mathematician on the street (not very theoretical),
classical theorems often follow from constructivist (a la Bishop) one
if you assume that sequentially compact metric spaces are compact
(which means complete and totally bounded to Brouwer and Bishop),
so that might be one place to look.
