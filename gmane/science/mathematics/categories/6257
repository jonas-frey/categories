Dear John,

I am not offended personally.
You are free to repeat the "joke" ad nauseum, but who is laughing?
Some of your followers are taking the "joke" quite seriously:

You are a good mathematician.=20
You have made important contributions to higher category theory.
I am sure you can make further contributions.
I hope you will not leave math.=20
Everybody likes your web pages on maths and physics.

I applaude to your involvement:

I agree that the planet is presently heading for an ecological disaster.
You wrote that the situation about climate change is hopeless.
I can understand your pessimism, but how do you really know?
You also wrote that not all human beings will die.
Is this a source of optimism?
Who should be saved? Who can be abandoned?
You also wrote that we should consider using geo-engineering.
How different is your position from Bjorn Lomborg's?
