A full professor position will be available at Universit=E9 de
Savoie in Chamb=E9ry (France), from September 1, 2009.

The new professor will be a member of the LIMD group
(Logique, Informatique et Math=E9matiques Discr=E8tes) and is

languages (design, typing, compilation, ...), ...

The LIMD group is a UMR (mixed CNRS-University research

Universit=E9 de Savoie.  The LAMA (*) has presently 27
permanent  researchers in total; the LIMD group has 3 full
Professors, 4 "Maitre de conferences" and 2 CNRS

retirement of one of the professors.


The teaching assignments are: mathematics and/or computer
science for students from L1 to M2 (in the new european
terminology).


To get this position, it is necessary to

- speak french fluently, and

- have been accepted on the so-called "liste de
qualification". If you are not yet qualified, note that the
deadline for applying is usually around mid-october.

For further details, please don't hesitate to contact me.
