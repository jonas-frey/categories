Jim, 
   There is something wrong (probably internal at
xxx.lanl.gov) with your table of '98 abstracts in
various branches of math. I went there (for the
first time, thanks for the address) and clicked
on Category Theory and found 5 abstracts. Those
were all from the 3 months preceding this month,
so I thought there should be more in '98. I did
a search for the words 'category theory',
limited to '98, and got 8 abstracts. However,
more than half of those were classified,
primarily, as Quantum Groups or something. So
God only knows how many CT's there are in lanl
in '98, but not less than 5.
     John
