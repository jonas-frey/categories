Dear Jim,

A suitable reference would be:

Ross Street, "Two constructions on lax functors", Cahiers de=20
topologie et g=E9om=E9trie diff=E9rentielle cat=E9goriques, tome 13,=20
no 3 (1972) p. 217--264.

The relevance of this paper to your notion is as follows. We=20
learnt from B=E9nabou that a monad on a category may be=20
expressed as a lax functor of 2-categories 1 --> Cat, with=20
the unique object of 1 being sent to the category C on which=20
the monad subsists; the unique morphism of 1 being sent to=20
the underlying functor F of the monad; and the lax=20
preservation of identities and composition yielding the=20
natural transformations eta : 1 -> F and mu : FF -> F,=20
together with the monad laws they are required to satisfy.

Now given a monoid M, your notion of filtered monad with=20
respect to M may similarly be expressed as a lax functor into=20
Cat; but one whose domain is no longer the terminal category,=20
but rather the monoid M, viewed as a one-object category.=20
Indeed, such a lax functor picks out, firstly, a category C,=20
this being the image of the unique object; then, for every=20
element m of the monoid, an endofunctor F_m of C; and=20
finally, by virtue of the lax functoriality, coherent natural=20
transformations F_n o F_m -> F_{nm} and id =3D> F_1. (Note that=20
this last condition slightly generalises your situation, in=20
in which you required that F_1 should actually be the=20
identity functor.)

The paper of Ross's which I reference above is concerned=20
precisely with lax functors A -> Cat for some ordinary=20
category A; and states one of its reasons for studying such=20
as being "to provide a generalization of the theory of=20
triples". It therefore seems an eminently suitable reference=20
for your purposes.

Best wishes,

Richard
