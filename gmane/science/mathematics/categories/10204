Dear All,

I would like to invite applications for a fully-funded PhD position in
the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, UK.

Topics of interest include:

* Syntax and semantics of type theory
* Formalisation of mathematics in univalent foundations
* Directed type theory
* Algebraic specification of programming languages

Students broadly interested in one of these fields of research, or a
related field, are strongly encouraged to apply.

Applicants should hold, or be about to obtain, a Masters or Bachelor
degree in Computer Science or Mathematics.

The PhD position is fully funded, covering tuition fees and a tax-free
scholarship. Healthcare is provided.

For further details please send me an email (b.ahrens@cs.bham.ac.uk) and
see my website (https://benediktahrens.net).

The theory group at Birmingham's School of Computer Science is very
active, organising regular seminars and informal meetings, such as the
YaMCATS category theory seminar, Midlands Graduate School, and Workshops
on Univalent Mathematics. For more information see
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/.

Information on how to apply is given on
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-research/. However,
interested candidates should contact me in the first instance.

All the best,
Benedikt Ahrens
