Meanwhile the following examples occurred to me:

1.  Implicational logic without conjunction.

2.  The type structure of the pure lambda calculus without products.

3.  The subcategory of FinSet consisting of the prime powers.

(With regard to 3, Mike Barr mentioned to me that (Eilenberg and?) Kelly
had come up with the category "-6" meaning the category of all sets save
those with six elements, but this seems less natural than the prime
powers, important in ideal theory as we saw in the recent discussion
about the division lattice.)

The free closed category would be a good example if it had ever been
sighted in nature?  Has it?  (Just because we see initial ring every day
in the wild doesn't mean that all free objects arise in nature.)
