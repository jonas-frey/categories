1.  Is there a variety embedding coinduction?

Jesse Hughes distinguishes induction from recursion in terms of natural
numbers.  For him induction is Peano's mathematical induction, while
recursion is the uniqueness of the map from the (unique up to a unique
isomorphism) initial algebra to an arbitrary algebra.

To me induction is on the one hand a slightly more general notion, yet on
the other sufficiently tractable that it can be axiomatized equationally
when suitably expressed, as I'll now describe.  In particular there
exists a variety embedding induction, meaning one in which an induction
principle holds.  Whether the additional generality makes induction
equal to recursion is another story.

The context in which all this arose, namely answers to Al Vilcius'
question about coinduction, naturally prompts the question, is there a
variety embedding coinduction, to which I'll return at the end.

2.  Nature of Induction

Suppose, somewhere out there in the universe, a world exists where
kicking a nonworking TV set always leaves it in its nonworking state.
Then in that world (certainly not ours), it is surely the case that
repeated kicking can do no better.

The general principle here is that if performing a certain action on
a system cannot under any circumstance destroy a certain property of
that system, then neither can _repeatedly_ performing that action on
that system.

I submit that this is the essence of induction, of which mathematical
induction is just an instance.

This principle may be expressed more logically as

        PQ  |- P
        -------            (IND)
        PQ* |- P

The premise is that Q preserves P.  That is, if first P and then
afterwards Q, it follows that P.

The conclusion is that Q* preserves P.  That is, if first P and then
afterwards Q repeatedly, it follows that P.  Here we understand Q*
as the reflexive transitive closure of Q, in the spirit of Kleene's
regular expressions, which we take to denote the performance of Q zero
or more times.

By itself (IND) serves only to bound Q* from above, which would allow
us to satisfy (IND) with Q* = 0 for all Q.  We may bound Q* from below
by adding that Q* is a closure of Q, namely Q <= Q*, and is transitive
--- Q*Q* <= Q* --- and reflexive --- 1 <= Q*.  These additional
conditions make Q* the least reflexive transitive element greater or
equal to Q (proved below), thereby uniquely determining it.

3.  Equational Expression of Induction

The earliest description to my knowledge of a finitely based variety
embedding an induction principle is Tarski and Ng's RAT [1] (1977).
(The second is DALG, dynamic algebras, which I described two years later
[2] (1979), independently of [1], which I did not learn about until 1989.)
The following, based on [3] (1990), generalizes the Boolean setting for
RAT to residuated semirings.  Others who have worked on finitely based
varieties embedding induction include Kozen, Bloom, and Esik, to name
just a few.

Take as the ambient variety that of semirings with unit.  The signature
is 2-2-0-0, notated (X, ., +, 0, 1).  The equations are:

1.  (X,+,0) is a semilattice with unit: + is associative (1), commutative
(2), and idempotent (3), with identity 0 (4).

2.  (X,.,1) is a monoid:  . is associative (5), with identity 1 (6,7).

3.  Distributivity:
        x.(y+z) = x.y + x.y              (8)
        (x+y).z = x.z + y.z              (9)

(Distributivity could be weakened to monotonicity for our purposes,
but since (RR) and (LR) below force it anyway we may as well put it in
here to justify calling this a semiring.)

We make the following abbreviations.

        xy for x.y
        x <= y for x+y = y (inequations are expressible equationally)
        x |- y for x <= y (i.e. for x+y = y), to look more logical

The induction principle IND may then be understood as being about such
a semiring expanded with a unary operation *.

Thus far the signature has constants 0 and 1, binary operations + and
., and a unary operation *, amounting to Kleene's language of regular
expressions.  The addition of two further binary operations, suitably
axiomatized equationally, permits a purely equational expression of
the foregoing.

The desired language expansion adds right and left residuation, x\y and
x/y (of which just the first suffices for our immediate purposes).

              PQ <= R iff Q <= P\R (right residuation)     (RR)
                      iff P <= R/Q (left residuation)      (LR)

These axioms, recognizable in this forum of course as making P\ and
/P the polarities of a Galois connection or posetal adjunction, serve
to define P\Q and Q/P uniquely in terms of the semiring operations.
In particular they force P\Q (resp. Q/P) to be the greatest, i.e. weakest,
element satisfying P(P\Q) <= Q (resp. (Q/P)P <= Q).

If we interpret PQ logically as a noncommutative conjunction P _then_ Q,
then P\Q, or P -> Q, may be understood logically as "if previously P, then R".
Similarly Q/P, or Q <- P, becomes "Q provided eventually P".  One way of
looking at this is that we are furnishing the signature with internal
conditionals in order to express the external conditionals in (IND),
(RR), and (LR) purely equationally.

(RR) and (LR) serve not merely to axiomatize residuation but to define
it, in the sense that for any given semiring there exists at most one
interpretation of right residuation satisfying (RR).  Hence (RR) serves
(a) to pick out those semirings having exactly one such interpretation,
and (b) to enforce that interpretation.  Similarly for (LR).

The nonequational definition of residuation given by (RR) and (LR)
has the following equipollent equational expression (exercise):

        P\(Q+R) = P\Q + P\R               (10)
        P(P\Q) <= Q <= P\(PQ)             (11)
        (P+Q)/R = P/R + Q/R               (12)
        (Q/P)P <= Q <= (QP)/P             (13)

(Actually (10) and (12) are overkill, it suffices to state that P\Q
and Q/P are monotone in Q, viz. P\Q <= P\(Q+R) and similarly for Q/P.
Also left residuation along with (LR), (12), and (13) are redundant for
the purposes of the present story.)

Three more equations complete the promised variety.

        1 + P*P* + P <= P*                (14)
        P* <= (P+Q)*                      (15)
        (P\P)* <= P\P                     (16) (induction, equationally) [1]

Equation (14) says that P* is a reflexive transitive element greater or
equal to P.

Equation (15) merely asserts the monotonicity of *.

Equation (16) is the equational expression of induction.  It is
equivalent to

        P(P\P)* <= P                      (16')

That is, the repeated action of P\P preserves P.

The interest in P\P is first of all that it preserves P, i.e.

        P(P\P) <= P

as an immediate consequence (by (RR)) of P\P <= P\P; and second that
it is the weakest (greatest) preserver of P, since if PQ <= P then
Q <= P\P (by (RR)).

This makes (16') the instance of induction in which the preserver of P
happens to be P\P.

But since P\P is the _weakest_ preserver of P, we can now obtain the
general (nonequational) induction principle, namely from PQ <= P infer
PQ* <= P, from this specific equationally expressible instance of it, viz.

        PQ  <= P
        Q   <= P\P          by (RR)
        Q*  <= (P\P)*       by (15) (monotonicity of *)
        PQ* <= P(P\P)*      by (9) (additivity of P. implies its monotonicity)
            <= P            by (16')

That is, the induction principle (IND) holds in the variety axiomatized by
(1)-(16).

More than this however, the unary operation * is uniquely determined
by (14)-(16) by virtue of P* being the least (hence unique) reflexive
transitive element of the semiring greater or equal to P.  To see this,
consider any reflexive transitive X.  By transitivity XX <= X so X <=
X\X, whence X* <= (X\X)* <= X\X.  Hence XX* <= X.  Concatenating X* on the
right of each side of 1 <= X yields X* <= XX* <= X.  Now suppose P <= X.
Then P* <= X* <= X, making P* the least reflexive transitive element >= P.

The residuals are of course uniquely determined by (10)-(13).  So any
semiring can be expanded with residuation and star so as to satisfy
(10)-(16) in at most one way.  That is, those seven equations not only
single out those semirings admitting such an expansion but serve to fully
define pre- and post-implication as well as reflexive transitive closure,
entirely in terms of the given semiring.

Given the well-known difficulties of defining the natural numbers using
Peano's mathematical induction, or by any other first order means, it is
a pleasant change to see an ostensibly intractable operation such as P*
pinned down exactly in this way, and even more pleasant that it is all
done purely equationally.

4.  Back to the question

We may now reword the original question in the light of the foregoing.

To what variety can one similarly associate suitable operations fully
defined equationally so as to include an equationally expressed principal
of coinduction?
