I would like to add another example to Eduardo=E2=80=99s.

In computer science both algebras and coalgebras for an endofunctor on =
sets are useful structures and both initial algebras and final =
coalgebras play an important role in the semantics of programming =
languages.

It is now an important feature that algebras and coalgebras over set are =
not dual to each other. Only the invention of the dual category reveals =
the underlying duality.

The ensuing tension between `abstract=E2=80=99 duality and `concrete=E2=80=
=99 non-duality is certainly one reason why the study of set-coalgebras =
is fascinating.=20

For example, whereas it is well-known that the initial sequence of a =
finitary set-endofunctor converges in omega steps, a result by Worrell =
shows that the final sequence of a finitary set-endofunctor converges in =
omega+omega steps.

Best wishes, Alexander
