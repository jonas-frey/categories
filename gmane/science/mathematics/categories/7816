Thanks Marta an Thomas, I am learning a lot !.

I would like to comment in the items marked [[1===1]] and [[2===2]] of
your answers. It seems to me now that the argument in my question does
not need any theory of indexing categories.
See, concerning [1===1] above I can say:

My construction does not involve EE. It involves an internal site CC in
SS, a functor CC ---> SS, a coproduct in SS indexed by an object in SS,
and a SINGLE object X in EE, which is sheaf CC^op ---> SS. All this
involves ONLY SS, and no forbiden quantifications are used. So the
internal logic of SS should suffice.

Concerning [2===2], you are probably right in many cases, precisely
cases that I distrust because I feel the authors are not carefully
enough (this due to my ignorance together with a tendency to be as Saint
Thomas, "have to see to belive"). But in other cases not. For example,
the entire paper Joyal-Tierney, An extension of the galois theory of
grothendieck, Memoirs 309, is no "blue print" for nothing, it is in
final form, very careful, and entirely justified (even their change of
base) without any need of fibered/indexed arguments, as they say, (e.g.
Boileau-Joyal) suffices.

For example, they consider p: EE ---> SS, and say p_* sends sup-lattices
to sup-lattices, they consider a left adjoint  p^# (between the
categories of sup-lattices) and stablish an isomorphism

                Hom(L, p_*(M)) = p_*Hom(p^#(L), M)  in  SS

and say "expresses the (strong) adjointness p^# --| p_*" (page 44).

They use "strong", no mention at all to "indexed adjoint", and this
isomorphism is just a definition of strong.

But, is not true that a topos p: EE ---> SS is canonically indexed and
that for many things you can proceed tacitly without need to mention any
theory of indexed categories ?. Even for constructions in EE ?. For
example, a family in EE indexed by I in SS is just an arrow X ---> p*I,
and the COPRODUCT_{i \in I} X_i in EE is just X.

Please, do not think I am against fibered/indexed arguments, I can not
be either against or in favor, since I do not know the theory.

After your answers I understand now the theory is useful when you need
to use quantifications not avaiable in the internal logic of a topos and
other things of this sort.

Best  Eduardo.
