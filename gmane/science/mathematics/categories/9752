Bidirectional transformations (bx) are a mechanism for maintaining the cons=
istency of at least two related sources of information. Such sources can be=
  relational databases, software models and code, or any other document foll=
owing standard or ad-hoc formats. Bx are an emerging topic in a wide range =
of research areas, with prominent presence at top conferences in several di=
fferent fields (namely databases, programming languages, software engineeri=
ng, and graph transformation), but with results in one field often getting =
limited exposure in the others. Bx 2019 is a dedicated venue for bx in all =
relevant fields, and is part of a workshop series that was created in order=
  to promote cross-disciplinary research and awareness in the area. As such,=
  since its beginning in 2012, the workshop has rotated between venues in di=
fferent fields.


Important Dates
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

- Abstract submission: 12 Feb 2019 (AoE)
- Paper submission:    19 Feb 2019 (AoE)
- Author notification:  8 Apr 2019
- Camera-ready version: around 1 May 2019
- Workshop: some day during 3=E2=80=937 June 2019


Aims and Topics
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners,=
  established and new, interested in bx from different perspectives, includi=
ng but not limited to:

- bidirectional programming languages and frameworks
- data and model synchronization
- view updating
- inter-model consistency analysis and repair
- data/schema (or model/metamodel) co-evolution
- coupled software/model transformations
- inversion of transformations and data exchange mappings
- domain-specific languages for bx
- analysis and classification of requirements for bx
- bridging the gap between formal concepts and application scenarios
- analysis of efficiency of transformation algorithms and benchmarks
- survey and comparison of bx technologies
- case studies and tool support


Submission Guidelines
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Papers must follow the CEUR one-column style available at

http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/samplestyles/

and must be submitted via EasyChair:

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dbx2019

Five categories of submissions are considered:

* Full Research Papers (up to 15 pages)
- in-depth presentations of novel concepts and results
- applications of bx to new domains
- survey papers providing novel comparisons between existing bx technologie=
s and approaches case studies

* Tool Papers (up to 8 pages)
- guideline papers presenting best practices for employing a specific bx ap=
proach (with a specific tool)
- presentation of new tools or substantial improvements to existing ones
- qualitative and/or quantitative comparisons of applying different bx appr=
oaches and tools

* Experience Report (up to 8 pages)
- sharing experiences and lessons learned with bx tools/frameworks/languages
- how bx is used in (research/industrial/educational) projects

* Extended Abstracts (up to 4 pages)
- work in progress
- small focused contributions
- position papers and research perspectives
- critical questions and challenges for bx

* Talk Proposals (up to 2 pages)
- proposed lectures about topics of interest for bx
- existing work representing relevant contributions for bx
- promising contributions that are not mature enough to be proposed as pape=
rs of the other categories

The bibliography is excluded from the page limits. All papers are expected =
to be self-contained and well-written. Tool papers are not expected to pres=
ent novel scientific results, but to document artifacts of interest and sha=
re bx experience/best practices with the community. Experience papers are e=
xpected to report on lessons learnt from applying bx approaches, languages,=
  tools, and theories to practical application case studies. Extended abstra=
cts should primarily provoke interesting discussion at the workshop and wil=
l not be held to the same standard of maturity as regular papers. Talk prop=
osals are expected to present work that is of particular interest to the co=
mmunity and worth a talk slot at the workshop.

We strongly encourage authors to ensure that any (variants of) examples are=
  present in the bx example repository at the time of submission, and for to=
ol papers, to allow for reproducibility with minimal effort, either via a v=
irtual machine (e.g., via Share - http://share20.eu) or a dedicated website=
  with relevant artifacts and tool access.

All papers will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the programme=
  committee.

If a paper is accepted, one author of the paper is expected to participate =
in the workshop to present it. Authors of accepted tool papers are also exp=
ected to be available to demonstrate their tool at the event.


Proceedings and Special Issue

=3D=3D=3D=3D

The workshop proceedings, including all accepted papers (except talk propos=
als), will be published electronically by CEUR (http://ceur-ws.org). A spec=
ial issue open to all authors of papers in BX workshops over the past few y=
ears is planned.
