I suspect that this feeling is shared to a greater or lesser degree by =

I also suspect that it arises out of perceptions based on Brouwer's

Hilbert's particular expression of The Law of the Excluded Middle, =
rather
than on a perception of what it was that Brouwer was actually objecting =
to
and rejecting.

In other words, such perceptions may be vulnerable to the "cover-up"
syndrome remarked upon by Physicist Richard P. Feynman in his 1965 Nobel
Lecture:

and so on. So there isn=92t any place to publish, in a dignified manner, =
what

I believe that Brouwer's "finished" articulation of his objection to
Hilbert's position vis-=E0-vis the foundations of logical reasoning may =
be an
instance of such unconscious =91cover up=92; if so, it is one that has =
had an
unintended, far-reaching and severely limiting consequences on a =
discipline.

The basis for my belief lies in Hilbert's interpretation of the =
universal
and existential quantifiers, which is detailed, for instance, in his =
1927
paper "The Foundations of Mathematics".

In this paper, Hilbert defines the quantifiers in terms of his
epsilon-function as:

(i) The formal sentence [(All x)F(x)] holds under a consistent
interpretation I if, and only if, the interpreted relation F(s) holds
whenever ~F(s) holds for any given s in I; hence ~F(s) does not hold for =
any
s in I (since I is consistent}), and so F(s) holds for any given s in I.

(ii) The formal sentence [(Exists x)F(x)] holds in I if, and only if, =
the
interpreted relation F(s) holds for some s in I.

He then deduces from it "Aristotle's dictum" and the "principle of the
excluded middle":

 (iii) Aristotle's dictum: If the formal sentence [(All x)F(x)] holds in =
I,
then the interpreted relation F(s) holds for any s in I,

and:

(iv) Principle of excluded middle: If the formal sentence [~(All x)F(x)]
holds in I, then the formal sentence [(Exists a)(~A(a)] holds in I.

(I assume that the above paper also reflects Hilbert's thesis prior to
Brouwer's objection.)

Now, in his 1908 paper "The Unreliability of the Logical Principles",
Brouwer stressed that, for Hilbert's above interpretation to be =
considered
sound when the domain of the quantifiers under an interpretation is
infinite, the decidability of the quantification under the =
interpretation
must be constructively verifiable in some intuitively and mathematically
acceptable sense of the term "constructive".

I doubt whether any practicing mathematician would take serious issue =
with
this objection.

I feel it is the perception that Brouwer's - and the Intuitionistic -
objection relates specifically to the Law of the Excluded Middle - of =
which
(iv) is merely one statement - that seems to give rise to the sense of
disquietitude expressed by Vaughan Pratt in his above cited post.

The reasons for such disquietitude are not far to seek.

Currently it is implicitly accepted (as intuitively plausible) by =
practicing
mathematicians that, in first-order Peano Arithmetic (PA) for instance:

(1) The PA-formula [(Exists x)F(x)] is an abbreviation of [~(All =
x)~F(x)],
and is defined as true in the standard interpretation M of PA if, and =
only
if, it is not the case that, for any given natural number n, the =
interpreted
relation ~F(n) holds in M;

(2) The interpreted relation F(n) holds in M for some natural number n =
if,
and only if, it is not the case that, for any given natural number n, =
~F(n)
holds in M.

Now, since (1) and (2) together interpret (Exists x)F(x) in M as =
intended by
Hilbert's epsilon-function, they similarly attract Brouwer's objection -
which, thus, remains unresolved in current literature.=20

Thus, for a practicing mathematician today, the Intuitionistic rejection =
of
the Law of the Excluded Middle should be tantamount to rejecting the
standard interpretation of first-order PA as a valid model for PA.

This is not obvious if Brouwer's objection is perceived as primarily
rejecting Hilbert's principle of the excluded middle (iv), since the =
latter
may have other avatars, not all of which need attract Brouwer's =
objection.

In other words, Brouwer's objection needs to be seen not as rejecting =
the
Law of the Excluded Middle per se, but as specifically rejecting only
Hilbert's interpretation of the existential quantifier in (ii).

The point to note then is that, whereas (1) by itself preserves the =
formal
properties of PA-negation under interpretation in M, the further =
inference
in (2) from (1) does not; and it is this inference that is objected to =
by
Brouwer.

Moreover, Brouwer's objection becomes significant only if we accept that =
(2)
appeals to Platonically non-constructive, rather than intuitively
constructive, plausibility.

Since most practicing mathematicians are comfortable with informal =
Platonic
reasoning, but uncomfortable with formal reasoning that cannot be
interpreted constructively, it is this aspect of (2) that appears to =
place
them on the horns of the following dilemma:

Even if we accept that the existential quantifier is interpreted
non-constructively in current literature by accepting (2), how do we
interpret such quantification constructively without sacrificing
mathematical reasoning and mathematical structures that a practicing
mathematician intuitively accepts as well-founded?

This is the grey area that Intuitionistic - and finitist - reasoning =
have
sought to address since Brouwer, primarily by focusing on what remains =
of
classical mathematics (post Hilbert) after rejecting (2) above.

The problem, of course, is that rejection of a widely - even if
uncomfortably - held tenet is never a solution unless one replaces it =
with
one that is less uncomfortable.

This is the "It's better to live in a house with a leaking roof, than to
bring the roof down over one's head" syndrome.

So the question is: Can we provide a "comfortable", finitary, =
interpretation
of PA that accepts (1), but rejects (2) if necessary?

I believe that every practicing mathematician knows that the answer to =
this
question must be a "yes', since mathematical languages seem to =
communicate
effectively in practice in all areas of human endeavour.

In other words, every practicing mathematician knows that the =
significant
body of mathematical reasoning and structures is founded on a finitary
foundation.

The issue, therefore, is simply one of identifying the structure.

Now Turing has shown in his seminal 1936 paper on computable numbers =
that
every arithmetical function (or relation, when interpreted as a Boolean
function) F defines a Turing-machine TM_F.

This suggests the possibility of replacing (1) by:

(3) The PA-formula [(Exists x)F(x)] is an abbreviation of [~(All =
x)~F(x)],
and is defined as true in an interpretation B of PA if, and only if, it =
is
not the case that the Turing-machine TM_F computes F(n) as always false
(i.e., as false for any given natural number n in B).=20

Now, I have shown in the Dec07 issue of the on-line journal, The =
Reasoner,
that an interpretation along these lines is actually a finitary model =
for
PA, since all theorems of PA interpret as true in B.

http://www.thereasoner.org/

Moreover, the interpretation B satisfies Brouwer's criteria, since - by
virtue of Turing's Halting argument - the mirror of (2) does not hold in =
B.

In other words, in the finitary model B, from the PA-provability of =
[~(All
x)F(x)], we may only conclude that TM_F does not compute F(n) as always =
true
in B.

We may not conclude further that TM_F must compute F(n) as false in B =
for
some natural number n, since F(x) may be a Halting-type of function that =
is
not Turing-computable.=20

What this means is that we may not conclude from the PA-provability of
[~(All x)F(x)] that F(n) does not hold in B for some natural number n.

Of course the consequences of such a finitary model for PA are =
far-reaching,
since it (expectedly?) follows that the accepted standard =
(non-constructive)
interpretation of PA - which is based on accepting (2) above - is not a
model of PA!

I address the above points in detail in a series of commentaries in the
Sep07, Oct07, Nov07, Dec07 and Jan08 issues of The Reasoner and in two
papers that I am compiling for publication:
