Third Workshop on Natural Language and Computer Science
NLCS '15
July 5, 2015
Kyoto, Japan
http://www.indiana.edu/~iulg/nlcs.html

A workshop affiliated with 42nd International Colloquium on Automata,
Languages and Programming (ICALP 2015) and 30th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium
on Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2015)

Endorsed by the Association for Computational Linguistics Special Interest
Group on Computational Semantics

Paper submission deadline: April 2, 2015


AIMS AND SCOPE

Formal tools coming from logic and category theory are important in both
natural language semantics and in computational semantics. Moreover, work
on these tools borrows heavily from all areas of theoretical computer
science. In the other direction, applications having to do with natural
language has inspired developments on the formal side. The workshop invites
papers on both topics. Specific topics includes, but are not limited to:

=E2=80=A2 logic for semantics of lexical items, sentences, discourse and di=
alog
=E2=80=A2 continuations in natural language semantics
=E2=80=A2 formal tools in textual inference, such as logics for natural lan=
guage
inference
=E2=80=A2 applications of category theory in semantics
=E2=80=A2 linear logic in semantics
=E2=80=A2 formal approaches to unifying data-driven and declarative approac=
hes to
semantics

Gerard de Melo, Tsinghua University
