** ONLINE WORLDWIDE SEMINAR ON LOGIC AND SEMANTICS (OWLS) **
** https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vicaryjo/owls/ **

The Online Worldwide Seminar on Logic and Semantics is an online-only
series of research talks, highlighting the most exciting recent work
in the international computer science logic community. In this time of
restricted international travel, a key aim of this series is to
provide a forum for informal discussion and social interaction that is
so important for the progress of science. To facilitate this, the
seminar incorporates in virtual form a number of features more
normally associated with physical meetings, including virtual "coffee
breaks" before and after the seminar, allowing participants to chat in
small groups. (Don't forget to bring your own coffee.)

Starting this Wednesday, we are excited to announce the first of our
OWLS Young Researcher talks, given by a researcher within 7 years of
completing their PhD. A new initiative, these OWLS-YR talks will take
place fortnightly, interleaved with regular OWLS talks. Our goal is to
give a platform to the excellent work being done by junior members of
the community. All members of the community are encouraged to attend
these talks.

** UPCOMING PROGRAMME **

Talks take place on Wednesdays at 2pm UTC+1. Abstracts are available
at the OWLS homepage. Visit this link to sign up for reminder emails
on the day of the talk: https://bit.ly/3cm0GZG

  - 3 June (OWLS-YR). Dmitry Chistikov, University of Warwick,
"Parikh's theorem from the complexity viewpoint"
  - 10 June (OWLS). Valeria Vignudelli, ENS Lyon, "Monads and
quantitative equational theories for nondeterminism and probability"
  - 17 June (OWLS-YR). Marie Fortin, University of Liverpool, "FO=3DFO3
for linear orders with monotone binary relations"
  - 24 June (OWLS). Anupam Das, University of Birmingham
  - 1 July (OWLS-YR). Amina Doumane, CNRS, ENS de Lyon
  - 8 July (OWLS). Christine Tasson, IRIF, Paris
  - 15 July (OWLS-YR). Justin Hsu, University of Wisconsin=E2=80=93Madison, =
"A
separation logic for probabilistic independence"
  - 22 July (OWLS). Tarmo Uustalu, Reykjavik University

** SEMINAR INFORMATION **

Talks are fully interactive, with audience members able to see the
speaker's face at the same time as the slides, and able to ask
questions with full audio and video, just as they would in a physical
seminar, allowing the nuanced communication that is so critical for
modern science.

After and before each seminar, the participants split into small
groups for informal discussion, an optional feature of the seminars
which has already become a favourite feature of the series for many of
the regular participants. Everybody is welcome to join these friendly
discussions.

The seminar series is based on the Zoom technology platform, which is
capable of handing large meetings with ease. Visit the OWLS webpage
given at the top of this email for more information about the seminar.

Best wishes, the organizers:

   - Nathana=C3=ABl Fijalkow, CNRS, Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en
Informatique, France
   - Charles Grellois, Universit=C3=A9 Aix-Marseille, France.
   - S. Krishna, IIT Bombay, India
   - Koko Muroya, RIMS, Kyoto University, Japan
   - Alexandra Silva, University College London
   - Pawel Sobocinski, Tallinn University of Technology
   - Jamie Vicary, University of Cambridge
