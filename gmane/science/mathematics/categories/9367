Dear Emily and Ren??,

Under this list, and e.g. in connection with G??del's Incompleteness
Theorem (which I still call the Incompleteness Paradox), I have thrown
out the idea that logic may and perhaps even should be "lative", in the
sense that

- first we fix sorts and operators, i.e., the signature
- then we build terms based on that signature, but terms cannot change
anything about the underlying signature, so the door is closed, so as to
say
- sentences then build upon terms, and similarly cannot manipulate or
change whatever is in the term set

And so on, so an entailment, building e.g. upon sentences, even if being
"true" cannot be seen as a sentence, i.e., we should allow ourselves to
view entailments also as sentences and throw them back into the bag of
sentences. This is what G??del is doing, and this is widely accepted. I
don't accept, but this is now not my message here.

---

Triadic relations are potentially "illative" in this respect. Port-Royal
is dyadically lative, I would say, and maybe Peirce "triadically
lative", but a bit les so. Both are not formal enough, but my question
is how trijunctions or multivariable adjunctions think in theses
respects?

Best,

Patrik

PS "Lative logic", yet to be better defined, is an extension of Goguen's
Institutions and Meseguer's Entailment Systems.
