How can we have a categorical definition of 'theory', when we do not
have a categorical definition of 'sentence'?

Institutions (Goguen) and Entailment Systems (Meseguer) do have a
Sentence functor but their underlying category of signatures is
abstract, so without sort (over a category?) and operators (potentially
over another category?).

Many-valuedness and its (algebraic) foundations is looking into these
things.

Just wondering if anybody is thinking along these lines. Uwe at least, I
guess.

Cheers,

Patrik

PS Why many-valuedness? Well, for one thing, everything in and around
Google and Facebook is many-valued.
