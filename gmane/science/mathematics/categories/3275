Sorry, I meant to write distributive category, a la Chapter 3 of Bob
Walters' book "Categories and Computer Science".  (I just finished
writing an article on algebra, I seem to have algebras on the brain.)

Right, that was the example I had in mind.
Distributive lattices:posets :: distributive categories:?

As an initial guess: "categories", with dualizer Set, which is both a
category and a distributive category.  So is CAT(C,Set) a distributive
category?  And if so, is DCAT(CAT(C,Set),Set) equivalent to C?  And what
about the enriched case V-DCAT(V-CAT(C,V),V)?
