                         First Call For Papers

            17th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop

                          June 28 - 30, 2004

                   Asilomar, Pacific Grove, CA, USA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sponsored by the Technical Committee on Security and Privacy of the IEEE
Computer Society

This workshop series brings together researchers in computer science to
examine foundational issues in computer security. We are interested both
in new results in theories of computer security and also in more
exploratory presentations that examine open questions and raise
fundamental concerns about existing theories. Both papers and panel
proposals are welcome.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

Access control       Authentication            Data and system integrity
Database security    Network security          Distributed systems security
Anonymity            Intrusion detection       Security for mobile computin=
g
Security protocols   Security models           Decidability issues
Privacy              Executable content        Formal methods for security
Information flow     Language-based security

For background information about the workshop, and an html version of this
Call for Papers, see http://www.csl.sri.com/csfw/index.html (the CSFW home
page). This year the workshop will be held in Pacific Grove, CA, USA.
Information about the location and the organization will be soon available
on the web page. (http://www.csl.sri.com/csfw/csfw17).

The proceedings are published by the IEEE Computer Society Press and will
be available at the workshop. Selected papers will be invited for
submission to the Journal of Computer Security.


Instructions for Participants
-----------------------------

Submission is open to anyone.  Workshop attendance is limited to about 50
participants.  Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that
have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings.  Papers should be at most 20 pages long
excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices (using 11-point font,
single column format, and reasonable margins on 8.5"x11" paper), and at mos=
t
25 pages total.  Alternatively, papers can be submitted using the two-colum=
n
IEEE Proceedings style available for various document preparation systems a=
t
ftp://pubftp.computer.org/Press/Outgoing/proceedings/.  Papers in this styl=
e
should be at most 12 pages long (at most 15 pages including bibliography an=
d
appendices).  The page limit will be strictly adhered to.  Committee member=
s
are not required to read the appendices, and so the paper should be
intelligible without them.  Proposals for panels should be no more than
five pages in length and should include possible panelists and an indicatio=
n
of which of those panelists have confirmed participation.

Instructions about how to submit a paper will be soon available on the web
page (http://www.csl.sri.com/csfw/csfw17). If for any reason you cannot
conform to those submission guidelines, please contact the program chair
at focardi@dsi.unive.it. Papers should be submitted in Postscript or
Portable Document Format (PDF).  Papers submitted in a proprietary
word-processor format such as Microsoft Word cannot be considered.

At least one coauthor of each accepted paper is expected to attend
CSFW-17. Papers that do not adhere to this policy will be removed from the
proceedings.

Workshop Location
-----------------

The 17th IEEE Computer Security Foundations workshop will be held
at the Asilomar Conference Center, located on the beautiful Monterey
Peninsula in Pacific Grove California.  Asilomar, meaning "refuge by the
sea", is a tranquil environment surrounded by forest and white sand
beaches.  As a member of the California State Park system, it offers
107 extraordinary acres of forests, dunes, and coastline situated on
the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.  Founded in 1913 as the
western conference center for the Young Women's Christian Association
(YWCA), it is the ideal conference setting.

Asilomar offers secluded guest rooms with forest or marine views.  Rooms
are clustered into quaint lodges, some of which feature fireplaces.  Sunset
walks along the beach and coastal trails are a great way to unwind.  On-sit=
e
recreation includes a heated swimming pool, volleyball and billiard tables.

Just minutes away is Pebble Beach, featuring world-class golf courses and
scenic 17-Mile Drive.  And some of the most breathtaking coastline in the
world can be found just 20 minutes to the south toward Big Sur along Hwy 1.
Also nearby is the Monterey Bay Aquarium, featuring spectacular, deep-sea
and
kelp forest exhibits.  Monterey Bay hosts a unique deep-sea environment
close to shore.  There is an underwater canyon over 2km deep at around 15km
from shore.

Asilomar is 2.3 hours by car from San Francisco International Airport
(SFO). There are direct flights between San Francisco and most major
European and American cities.  The Monterey regional airport (MRY) is 10
minutes by car from Asilomar.  There are direct flights to MRY from Los
Angeles International Airport (LAX) and SFO about every 2 hours until
10pm.  More travel information can be found on the CSFW17 website.
