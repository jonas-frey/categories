Dear Bill and Colleagues,=20

I would like to explain my own interest in function spaces and function =
objects since it has a different origin to what Bill explains and a =
different direction which could be of interest for comment and =
investigation.=20

Michael Barratt suggested to me in 1960 the problem of calculating the =
homotopy type of the space X^Y by induction on the Postnikov system of =
X, in contrast to Michael's own work on Track Groups, where he used a =
homology decomposition of Y, and using Whitney's tube systems gave =
explicit description of some group extensions in examples of the =
Barratt(-Puppe) exact sequence. (amazing!!?)=20

Now the first Postnikov invariant in its simplest form is a Sq^2 but the =
extension is described by a Sq^1. How did the one transform into the =
other? Clue: the Cartan formula for Sq^2 on a product. How did a product =
get into the act? Answer: the evaluation map!=20

Trying to write all this down led to using a number of `exponential =
laws' in spaces, spaces with base point, simplicial sets, pointed =
simplicial sets, chain complexes, simplicial abelian groups, etc. So it =
was dinned into me that an exponential law depended on the product as =
well as the function object. So why not try the known weak product for =
topological spaces? Surprise, surprise, it all worked, and was part 1 of =
my thesis, submitted 1961, with a sketchy account of what we now call =
monoidal closed categories, exemplified,  but not developed in general =
terms.=20

Subsequent work with Philip Higgins has continued to use monoidal closed =
categories in algebraic topology. Indeed the category of crossed =
complexes is cartesian closed, but the homotopy theory one wants is =
given by the (different) monoidal closed structure. So the category of =
filtered spaces is usefully enriched  over this monoidal closed =
category.=20

My question is then: what is the potential influence of this need for =
monoidal closed? It clearly does not lead to topos theory as such. It =
does lead to the possibility of some not previously available =
calculations, even of nonabelian homotopical invariants, and is relevant =
to the study of local-to-global problems. (I first heard these words =
from Dick Swan in connection with sheaf theory.)  But in this work =
cubical sets became essential, for ease of discussing subdivision, =
multiple compositions,  and homotopies, and here the monoidal closed =
structure is crucial. Kan's initial cubical work was neglected in favour =
of the (convenient in many ways) cartesian closed category of simplicial =
sets.=20

One specific problem for me was a general notion of symmetry (naively, =
and using buzz words (!), higher order groupoids should yield higher =
order notions of symmetry!). In a cartesian closed category C we have =
for a specific object x not only Aut(x), the isomorphisms of x, but also =
AUT(x), the internal group object of automorphisms of x. This has been =
developed for the topos of directed graphs, in John Shrimpton's thesis, =
but actually the unaccomplished aim was to understand Grothendieck's =
Teichmuller Groupoid, and his envisaged computations of this by gluing =
or clutching procedures, but which needed topos theory, he claimed! When =
I asked for any notes on this he just said nothing was written down, it =
was all in his mind. Baffling! =20

In the monoidal case we can get only that END(x) is an internal monoid =
wrt tensor. But in some cases  we have a candidate for AUT(x), even if =
`internal group' wrt tensor makes no sense.  One example was worked out =
with Nick Gilbert (published 1989). In this case there is a forgetful =
functor U to a cartesian closed category, in this case Set, and you can =
make up the rest. It worked in this dimension, relevant to homotopy =
3-types, but still did not lead by induction to even higher order =
notions of symmetry. Pity!=20

My question is now: given this background, how should  we  match the =
beautiful ideas and insights of Bill with what seem to be some monoidal =
closed realities? Could this be important for geometry, and, better =
still, even for analysis, and dynamics?=20

Dear Jim and colleagues,

By urging the study of the good geometrical ideas and constructions of
Chen and Froelicher, as well as of Bott, Brown, Hurewicz, Mostow, =
Spanier,
Steenrod, I am of course not advocating the preferential resurrection of
the particular categories they tentatively devised to contain the
constructions.
