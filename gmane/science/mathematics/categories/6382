Dear colleagues and friends,

A number of members of the categories e-list will already be aware that
Gabor Lukacs and the mathematics department at the University of
Manitoba are involved in a dispute with the university administration
over matters of academic standards and even academic freedom. Since
Gabor is an active member of our community, we thought you might be
interested in a petition we are planning to send to the university early
in December. The text of the petition may be read at

https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=10YZB9O_W3ljWqxte41VtU2qWQmepkx4yqwDaKq2pdifnHRA7ncE-qbSh8Lap&hl=en&authkey=CNT8_MsO
