peacefully on Saturday morning around 7 AM, April 30, 2011 at the age of =
70.  He is finally at rest and no longer suffering.  In the last week of =
his life he was wonderfully cared for by the people of Haven Hospice.  =
My son David, daughter-in-law Amy, daughter Cindy and I were constantly =
at his side.   Dan died from the final stages of Alzheimer's and the =
associated complications.  We were able to follow his wishes of comfort =
and not making his suffering last any longer than nature had planned.=20

> Alzheimer's is truly a terrible disease.  It was very hard to watch =
what it did to Dan over the past 5+ years.  It stole the things he loved =
and took him from me too early.  It first took his ability to do =
mathematics, then ability to play music, read, rational thinking and =
finally recognition of those he loved (except me, thank goodness).=20
>=20

> I have no plans for an organized service.  Dan's body has been donated =
to medical science, following his clear and long standing wishes.  If =
the mathematics community would like to organize a memorial service or a =
memorial colloquium we would be very pleased.=20

If people feel that they would like to do something, I would very much =
support any assistance to your local hospice or to Haven Hospice=20
