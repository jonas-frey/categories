Dear Steve,


Thank you for your interesting comments. Grothendieck did not come up with =
the notion of an elementary topos - Lawvere and Tierney did, so much so tha=
t he informally referred to the subobjects classifier as "the Lawvere objec=
t". Nevertheless, the basic idea of Grothendieck of a category of sheaves o=
n a site is indeed captured by the more general (and certainly less controv=
ersial) notion of an S-bounded elementary topos, where S is an arbitrary el=
ementary topos with an NNO. I think that this is what you had in mind. As f=
or the word "topos", I believe that it ought to be specified in any context=
  where one uses it.  I find this way of proceeding preferable to identifyin=
g it with "Grothendieck topos" as Joyal suggests.


Best regards,

Marta

Dear Marta,

Thanks for your reply. My question was a survey of usage, so what follows i=
s  not meant disputatiously, but I thought your reasoning raised some inter=
esting issues.

As I see it you give two reasons here for taking Grothendieck toposes as be=
ing over Set =3D ZFC, both pertinent: (1) what Grothendieck meant, and (2) =
the (essential) uniqueness of geometric morphisms to Set.

(1) is delicate, given Grothendieck's underlying implicit definition of top=
os as "that of which topology is the study".

My understanding of this (you may know more - my knowledge of Grothendieck'=
s  work is almost all second-hand) is that there are two ways of viewing it=
, somewhat akin (respectively) to algebraic and general topology.

The first is that he meant a topos to be a category with which to do sheaf =
cohomology, by forming an (exact) injective resolution of Abelian groups, t=
aking global sections (becoming non-exact), and then extracting the ker/im =
cohomology groups. This is perhaps an algebraic topologist's idea of what t=
opology means. Classicality of Set seems then to be needed in order to get =
injective hulls in the category of sheaves over a site.

On the other hand, there is also the idea that global points can be recover=
ed as sections of the geometric morphism to Set, and the topos simultaneous=
ly  embodies both the points and the topology on them. Is this also part of=
  what Grothendieck meant? It is closer to general topology, points and thei=
r continuous transformations.

This idea then generalizes well to elementary toposes, replacing Set by S. =
Elementary toposes are not generalized spaces in themselves, but bounded ge=
ometric morphisms between them are, and many topological properties are red=
efined for geometric morphisms.

(2) raises the question of why Set should have its privileged property. Tec=
hnically, it is that every object of Set is a colimit of copies of 1, and t=
hat is preserved up to unique isomorphism by the inverse image part of any =
geometric morphism. But is that not because ZFC provides a 2-level structur=
e of  sets and classes, and we are implicitly using ZFC classes for our top=
oses? As we explore the foundational options then we should expect this uni=
queness property for Set =3D ZFC to evaporate.

All the best,

Steve.
