Dear colleagues,

Below (also as a pdf-attachment) you find the call for submission of
contributed talks to the Joint Workshop 'Domains8' and 'Computability
Over Continuous Data Types', Novosibirsk, September 11--15, 2007.  =20

It suffices to submit a title with an abstract.=20
             The Deadline is May 15.
As foreign participants need a visa, registration has to be done=20
             until June 30=20

              Novosibirsk, September 11 -- 15, 2007


 The Workshop 'Domains' series is aimed at computer scientists and
 mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
 foundations of computation. It focusses on domain theory, its =20
 applications and related topics. It will be combined with topics based=20
 on the German--Russian project=20
 'Computability Over Non-discrete Structures: Models, Semantics, Complexity=
'=20
 supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) and Deutsche=20
 Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

 SCOPE
  Topics for this workshop include, but are not limited to

     domains and topology for semantics
     effective domains and spaces
     computation over continuous spaces
     program semantics
     models of sequential computation
     lambda calculus
     realizability
     proof mining
     constructive mathematics and its semantics
     computability theory
     computable models
     admissible sets

 LOCATION
