Long before 1975, indeed before 1965, the term
"cartesian product" was in use for topological
spaces and for sets. At the latter date, the special
case of monoidal closed structure in which  the
product is the CATEGORICAL one was dubbed
cartesian. I do not recall whether it was Max or I
who suggested it. (I was periferally involved in=20
the EK discussions because of the posetal case
and my observations that logic is adjointness;
the passing misnomer "Browerian " instead of
"Heyting" was due to my reading of some
papers by Tarski that used an odd convention).

If I was responsible I regret it, since historical
considerations suggest that Galileo contributed=20
more than Descartes toward crystallizing the
catergorical product; especially the universality
is strongly suggested by pairs of paths in a way
that it to this day never was by pairs of mere points.

Concerning the French usage they of course=20
knew that those interesting squares are just=20
products over a base, and I presume that the
general case of fibrations was seen as a=20
generalization of the case C^2->C (induced=20
often as in algebraic geometry by some 2-functor
from  the latter), and hence generalized also
the use of the terminology.
