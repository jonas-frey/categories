The Ninth Australasian Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms (AWOCA'98)
will be held at the School of Computing of Curtin University of
Technology in Perth, Western Australia, Australia on July 27-30, 1998.
The workshop will follow the style of its predecessors: problem-oriented
papers, and an emphasis on informal discussion. To facilitate free
interchange of ideas, the number of participants is limited. If you wish
to attend, you should fill out the attached registration form and return
it together with your payment to:

Papers

Papers presenting completed research are not encouraged. Papers which
state and discuss open problems and work-in-progress within the general
theme of Combinatorial Algorithms are appropriate. Please include
sufficient background, extensive references to related work, plus
precise statements of one or more open problems. Authors are invited to
submit papers presenting original and unpublished research on ALL
theoretical aspects of Computer Science. Typical areas include (but are
not limited to):

   * Automata, Languages and Computability,
   * Algorithms and Data Structures,
   * Algorithmic Graph Theory and Combinatorics,
   * Cryptography,
   * Complexity Theory,
   * Computational Algebra and Geometry,
   * Computational Biology,
   * Graph Algorithms and Network Optimisation,
   * Graph Drawing,
   * New Paradigms of Computation,
   * Parallel and Distributed Computation,
   * Probabilistic and Randomized Algorithms

You may submit a paper by e-mailing  a postscript file  to:

awoca98@cs.curtin.edu.au

Submitted papers will be refereed and the accepted ones will appear in
the Proceedings published by Curtin University. After further
refereeing, selected papers will appear in a special issue of
Theoretical Computer Science.

Deadlines

   * Electronic submission (postscript files): 29 May 1998.
   * Acceptance/rejection notification: 17 June 1998.
