Dear All,

(this was sent earlier but had some html which may have got it rejected).
Thanks  very much for the info.

After I sent off my email I did remember (just about) papers of Tom=20
Fiore and of Grandis/Pare which were relevant and was collecting=20
together references, but fortunately you beat me to it, and with any=20
interesting points.

It may be convenient to have the definition of multiple composition in=20
KX, the cubical singular complex of X, on the record
as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------
Let $(m) =3D (m_1, \ldots , m_n)$ be an $n$-tuple of positive integers
and
$$\phi_{(m)} : I^n \rightarrow [0, m_1] \times \cdots \times [0,
m_n]$$ be the map $(x_1 , \ldots , x_n) \mapsto (m_1 x_1, \ldots ,
m_n x_n).$ Then a {\it subdivision of type $(m)$} \index{singular
$n$-cubes!subdivision of type $(m)$} of a map $\alpha : I^n
\rightarrow X$ is a factorisation $\alpha =3D \alpha' \circ
\phi_{(m)}$; its {\it parts} are the cubes $\alpha_{(r)}$ where $(r)
=3D (r_1, \ldots , r_n)$ is an $n$-tuple of integers with $1 \leqslant
r_i \leqslant m_i$, $i =3D 1, \ldots , n,$ and where $\alpha_{(r)} :
I^n \rightarrow X$ is given by
$$(x_1, \ldots , x_n) \mapsto
\alpha'(x_1 + r_1 - 1, \ldots , x_n + r_n - 1).$$

We then say that $\alpha$ is the {\it composite}of the
cubes $\alpha_{(r)}$ and write $\alpha =3D [\alpha_{(r)}]$. The {\it
domain} of $\alpha_{(r)}$ is then the set $\{(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in
I^n : r_i-1 \leqslant x_i \leqslant r_i, 1 \leqslant i \leqslant
n\}$.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----------
(I have also put on  the arXiv an exposition of Moore Hyperrectangles,=20
which is the start of another approach. One problem with this is that a=20
homotopy is more general than a Moore hyperrectangle as defined  there,=20
since a homotopy is a path in a space of such hyperrectangles.)

These compositions satisfy an interchange law, but without associativity=20
(unlike the Moore approach) we do not get of course any of what one=20
might call `partitioning' results. One should get these `up to homotopy'=20
but this seems  difficult to formulate.

In our work we also found the necessity of `connections', \Gamma^\pm _i,=20
which have many advantages including bringing the cubical theory a=20
little nearer to the simplicial: a cube \Gamma^\pm_i  x has two adjacent=20
faces the same. In the strict theory, or at least for groupoids, the=20
compositions, at least of two  cubes,  are recoverable from the=20
connections, up to homotopy.

Then of course one needs the more general n-fold objects. These occur=20
topologically from (n+1)-ads
X_*=3D (X;A_1, ....,A_n) where the A_i are subspaces of  X. Let \Phi=3D=20
\Phi(X_*) consist of maps of an n-cube into X which take the faces in=20
direction i into A_i. Then \Phi has n compositions, making it a `weak=20
n-fold category' . (The amazing fact (Loday) is that \p_1(\Phi, *),=20
where * is the constant map, gets the structure of cat^n-group =3D strict=
=20
(!!) n-fold groupoid in groups, and these model weak pointed homotopy=20
(n+1)-types. )

So I am just suggesting that cubical approaches have reached into=20
methods not easily approachable by simplicial or globular methods  and=20
perhaps more can be made of this.

Will more high powered approaches using operads help in all this?

I should also mention Richard Steiner's paper
Thin fillers in the cubical nerves of omega-categories=20
<http://0-ams.mpim-bonn.mpg.de.unicat.bangor.ac.uk/mathscinet/search/jour=
naldoc.html?cn=3DTheory_Appl_Categ>=20
<http://0-ams.mpim-bonn.mpg.de.unicat.bangor.ac.uk/mathscinet/search/publ=
ications.html?pg1=3DISSI&s1=3D240201>,=20
Theory App Categories (2006) 144--173 as suggesting the possibility of=20
using some kind of thin structure to define weak cubical categories.

My motivation all along was in terms of `algebraic inverses to=20
subdivision' .
