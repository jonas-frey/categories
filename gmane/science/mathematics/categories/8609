Dear categorists,

Consider the category M of internal groupoids in a Grothendieck topos,
equipped with the Joyal--Tierney model structure where the
cofibrations are the injective-on-objects functors and the weak
equivalences are the fully faithful functors that are essentially
surjective on objects (the latter in the sense of internal logic). Are
the fibrations in this model structure exponentiable in the sense that
pulling back fibrations along a fibration has a right adjoint?

Notice that M is a right proper model category in which the class of
cofibrations is closed under pullback, so if the answer to the above
question is yes, then the Lumsdaine--Warren construction can be
applied to obtain a model of dependent type theory with identity
types, dependent products, dependent sums, coproducts, etc.

Best wishes,
