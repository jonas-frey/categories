=================================================================
       TOPOLOGY, ALGEBRA AND CATEGORIES IN LOGIC (TACL 2019)

                     First announcement
=================================================================

Conference: June 17 - 21, 2019  in Nice
School:     June 10 - 15, 2019  in ??le de Porquerolles

https://math.unice.fr/tacl/2019/

Organized by Laboratoire J. A. Dieudonn??, Universit?? C??te d???Azur.


Scope
-----

Studying logic via semantics is a well-established and very
active branch of mathematical logic with many applications in
computer science and elsewhere. The area is characterized by
results, tools and techniques stemming from various fields,
including universal algebra, topology, category theory, order,
and model theory. The programme of the conference TACL 2019 will
focus on three interconnecting mathematical themes central to the
semantic study of logic and their applications: topological,
algebraic, and categorical methods.

TACL 2019 is the ninth conference in the series Topology, Algebra
and Categories in Logic (TACL, formerly TANCL). Earlier
instalments of this conference have been organized in Tbilisi
(2003), Barcelona (2005), Oxford (2007), Amsterdam (2009),
Marseille (2011), Nashville (2013), Ischia (2015), and Prague
(2017).


Featured topics

Contributed talks are intended to be about topological, algebraic
or categorical methods used in mathematical or computer science
logic. This includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:

    * Algebraic logic
    * Algebraic structures in CS
    * Categorical methods in logic
    * Coalgebra
    * Domain theory
