Hi David,

At 11:50 PM 12/3/2010, you wrote:

I agree completely. All I am saying is that since there is no effect
on the reaction by the presence of a neutral chemical, it might just
as well not be mentioned. Perhaps what I am getting at is a quotient
category in which X@Y->Z@Y is identified with X->Z in this specific
situation. I do believe this is how chemists think of their
applications of Hess' Law, which is what my inquiry is really all about.
