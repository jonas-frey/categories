Dear all,

we are happy to make an announcement for our summer school SMS 2018,
"Derived and Higher Structures in Geometry and Physics" at Fields
Institute, Toronto,
June 11-22, 2018, with funding application deadline, *15th of March*, at
Fields.

Higher categorical structures and homotopy methods have had significant
impact on in geometry and mathematical physics in recent years.

This summer school is aimed at transferring these ideas and fundamental
technical tools to the next generation of mathematicians.

The summer school will focus on the following four topics:  higher
categorical structures in geometry, derived geometry, factorization
algebras, and their application in physics. There will be eight
mini-courses on these topics, led by Kai Behrend, Chris Brav, Damien
Calaque, Kevin Costello, Si Li, Jacob Lurie, Ezra Getzler, and Claudia
Scheimbauer.

It is now opened for registration and funding application:

http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/17-18/sms-2018 (via Fields
Institute)

and

https://www.msri.org/summer_schools/843  (via MSRI)

You may register from either of them.

Looking forwards to seeing you at Fields in June!

--Best regards, Chenchang Zhu
