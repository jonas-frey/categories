Actually, on further thought, I agree with you.  I didn't originally want
a slick proof but to understand and then I forgot why I really raised the
question.  After all, I had already proved it.  So what I really wanted
and still want to know is what conditions on a map between two three term
sequences gives the 6 term exact sequence (with or without the end 0s).
The situation of the snake lemma is so different from the situation I
(and, obviously others) discovered that one wonders still what general
conditions could possibly encompass the two cases.  That really was my
initial question and that question now comes back to me.
