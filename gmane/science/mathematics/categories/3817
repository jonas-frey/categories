the homepages of the authors).


Street's work is about 2-categories of monads and many people needed the
simply categorical level, because of the Linear Logic connection. So
there are several printed versions of the restricted result, including
one of our group, I believe, in

Relating Categorical Semantics for Intuitionistic Linear Logic,  (M.
Maietti, P. Maneggia, V. de Paiva and E. Ritter) in Applied Categorical
Structures, volume 13(1):1--36, 2005.=20

But given our application we prove it for comonads, lifting both to
Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras and to co-Kleisli categories.

See Ross Street "The formal theory of monads", JPAA 2 (1972) 149-168 for
the general definition, in the abstract setting of a 2-category instead
of Cat.

Actually, there are two obvious generalizations of the TTT definition
("monad functors" and "monad opfunctors"), for the two possible
directions of F.
