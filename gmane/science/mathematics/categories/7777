Dear Peter,

I would like to ask you a naive question:

Is it runned on an actual quantum computer?


Best,
Andr=E9

Dear Category Theorists,

we are proud to announce the first public release of Quipper, an
embedded, scalable functional programming language for quantum
computing. The Quipper distribution is available here:

http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/

and includes extensive documentation, as well as seven worked examples
of non-trivial quantum algorithms from the literature. Here are some
highlights:

* High-level circuit description language, including both gate-by-gate
    descriptions and powerful higher-order operators for assembling and
    manipulating circuits.

* A monadic semantics, allowing for a mixture of procedural and
    declarative programming styles.

* Built-in facilities for automatic synthesis of reversible quantum
    circuits, including from classical Haskell code.

* Support for hierarchical circuits.

* Extensible quantum data types.

* Programmable circuit transformers (that are essentially monoidal
    functors).

* Support for a dynamic lifting operation to allow circuit generation
    to depend on parameters generated at circuit execution time.

* Extensive libraries of quantum functions, including: libraries for
    quantum integer and fixed-point arithmetic; the Quantum Fourier
    transform; an efficient quantum random access memory implementation;
    libraries for simulation of pseudo-classical circuits, Stabilizer
    circuits, and arbitrary circuits; libraries for exact and
    approximate decomposition of circuits into specific gate sets.

Comments are welcome!
