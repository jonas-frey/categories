Dear categorists,

The publisher has pre-announced my book on amazon.com.

Search on "Mathematical Mechanics: From Particle to Muscle."

A PDF of the work-in-progress is available on request.

Product Description

"This unprecedented book offers all the details of the mathematical mechanics
underlying state-of-the-art modeling of skeletal muscle contraction. The aim
is to provide an integrated vision of mathematics, physics, chemistry
and biology
for this one understanding. The method is to take advantage of modern
mathematical
technology - Eilenberg-Mac Lane category theory, Robinson
infinitesimal calculus
and Kolmogorov probability theory - to examine a succession of distinguishable
universes of particles, and continuous, thermodynamic, chemical, and molecular
bodies, all with a focus on proofs by algebraic calculation without
set theory.
Also provided are metaphors and analogies, and careful distinction between
representational pictures, mental model drawings, and mathematical diagrams.
High school mathematics teachers, undergraduate and graduate college students,
and researchers in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology may use this
integrated publication to broaden their perspective on science, and
to experience
the precision that mathematical mechanics brings to understanding the muscular
mechanism of nearly all animal behavior."
