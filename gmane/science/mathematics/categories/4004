Let me tell you a (slightly) amusing story.  Beno Eckmann warned me that
all librarians would hate me if I called it "$*$-Autonomous Categories".
I saw his point immediately and had every intention of changing it.  But
in the process of getting it typed and so on, I just plain forgot.  So
although I do object to *-autonomous (without the dollar signs that put it
on the line), I would have no problem with star-autonomous.

On ne saurait penser a tout, as they say on some obscure langauge.
