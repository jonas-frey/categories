Isosceles triangles caused a bit of discussion on the mathedu mailing
list recently, starting at
http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=3D6864271&tstart=3D0
(isosceles triangles only appear a couple of levels down and then the
discussion gets quite heated.) . I also wrote about it here:
http://sixwingedseraph.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/naive-proofs/ in
connection with the possibility of their being a generic triangle.

Wikipedia says the proof of the pons asinorum by mirror image was by Pappus=
.
