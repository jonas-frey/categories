I have access to the full online version of the OED, which does
contain the word topos. The earliest citation it has is to a 1948 work
of Leo Spitzer, who was apparently a linguist and literary historian.
Here is his Wikipedia page:
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Spitzer
He was Austrian, and it seems quite possible that he could have read
Curtius' treatise in the original German and begun to use the word
"topos" himself in the same year.
