I guess that in the category of R-modules over a commutative ring R,=20
a module M has a (good) dual iff it is finitely generated projective
iff the endo-functor functor Hom(M,-) preserves all colimits
(M is *compact* in a strong sense).=20

The rigidity terminology may have something to do with Tanaka duality.
If C is a rigid  monoidal category, then any monoidal natural=20
transformation u:F-->G between (strong) monoidal functors C-->E
(where E is a monoidal category) is invertible.

I would prefer a different terminology for monoidal categories with =
duals.

What about "auto-dual monoidal category"?

It as a bit like "autonomous" category.

Best,
Andr=E9
