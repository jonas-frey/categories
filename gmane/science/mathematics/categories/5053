The workshop on Formal Aspects of Security and Trust has
Springer LNCS post-proceedings and a potential journal
special issue.

We're extending the deadline to 20 July for abstract
submission and 24 July for the actual papers.

Would you like to make a submission?

It's been excellent the past several meetings.

OVERVIEW OF FAST

The sixth International Workshop on Formal Aspects of Security
and Trust (FAST2009) aims at continuing the successful efforts
of the previous FAST workshops, fostering cooperation among
researchers in the areas of security and trust.

Computing and network infrastructures have become pervasive, and
now they carry a great deal of economic activity.  Thus, society
needs well matching security and trust mechanisms.  Interactions
increasingly span several enterprises and involve loosely
structured communities of individuals.  Participants in these
activities must control interactions with their partners based
on trust policies and business logic.  Trust-based decisions
effectively determine the security goals for shared information
and for access to sensitive or valuable resources.

FAST focuses on the formal models of security and trust that are
needed to state goals and policies for these interactions.  We also
seek new and innovative techniques for establishing consequences of
these formal models.  Implementation approaches for such techniques
are also welcome.

PROCEEDINGS

Post-proceedings of the workshop will be published with LNCS.  A

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

	*** http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fast2009 ***

We seek papers presenting original contributions. Two types of
submissions are possible:

(1) short papers, up to 5 pages in LNCS format,
(2) full papers, up to 15 pages in LNCS format.

Submissions should clearly state their category (1 or
2). Author's full name, address, and e-mail must appear on the
first page.

Accepted full papers will be published in the formal
post-proceedings in LNCS.

Short papers as well as full papers will be included in the
informal proceedings distributed at the workshop.  After the
workshop, authors of short papers which are judged mature enough
for publication will be invited to submit full papers. These
will be reviewed according to the usual refereeing procedures,
and accepted papers will be published in the post-proceedings in
LNCS.

Simultaneous submission of full papers to a journal or
conference/workshop with formal proceedings justifies rejection.
Short papers at FAST are not formally published, so this
restriction does not apply to them.  However, related
publications and overlapping submissions must be cited
explicitly in short papers.
