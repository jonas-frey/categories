PhD studentship in algebraic topology
Swansea University Mathematics Department, College of Science

Applications are invited for a PhD studentship in algebraic topology,
funded by the EPSRC, to work on "Moduli spaces from a topological
point of view" with Dr Jeffrey Giansiracusa at Swansea University,
within the Mathematics Department. =A0The studentship is funded for
three years and is available for a start date of 1 October 2012 (or
earlier if desired).=A0 The studentship will cover tuition fees at the
Home/EU rate plus a stipend of approximately =A313,590 per annum based
on the standard EPSRC rate.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Moduli spaces are important and beautiful geometric objects that touch
many areas of pure mathematics. =A0This project aims to study moduli
spaces arising in low dimensional topology and algebraic geometry
through the powerful lens of homotopy theory. =A0The student will work
closely with Dr. Giansiracusa to study compactifications,
decompositions into elementary pieces, and applications to topological
quantum field theory, low-dimensional topology, and tropical geometry,
and algebraic geometry over the 'field with one element'. =A0The project
will begin in the area of topology, but could easily head towards
algebraic geometry, category theory or in other directions depending
on interests.

REQUIREMENTS

Applicants should either already have graduated with or expect to
graduate=A0by the end of 2011/12 academic year=A0with a 1st class or upper
2nd class honours degree in mathematics, or an equivalent
qualification from abroad.

Please note, there is no residency/nationality restriction, but the
funding will only cover fees at the home/EU rate.


TO APPLY

The deadline for receipt of applications is 22nd May at noon.

Applicants should send a CV and a covering letter with names of
referees directly to the Department by email or post. =A0The address is:

Dr Jeffrey Giansiracusa
Department of Mathematics
Swansea University
