*IMPORTANT NOTE: We are continuously monitoring the COVID-19 situation
from local authorities and the World Health Organization. ICLP 2020 is
half a year away, and we are confident that COVID-19 emergency will pass
   over and the conference will be held in September, as planned. And, if
necessary, alternative solutions, such as postponement, remote
presentations, etc will be looked into and identified.*


                            *** Call for Papers ***
                                   ICLP 2020

ICLP has been the premier international event for presenting research in
logic programming.

Tracks and Special Sessions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D
Besides the main track, ICLP 2020 will host additional tracks and special
sessions:

=E2=80=A2 Applications Track: This track invites submissions of papers on e=
merging
    and deployed applications of LP, describing all aspects of the developme=
nt,
    deployment, and evaluation of logic programming systems to solve real-wo=
rld
    problems, including interesting case studies and benchmarks, and discuss=
ing
    lessons learned.
=E2=80=A2 Sister Conferences and Journal Presentation Track: This track pro=
vides a
    forum to discuss important results related to logic programming that app=
eared
    recently (from January 2017 onwards) in selective journals and conferenc=
es
    but have not been previously presented at ICLP.
=E2=80=A2 Special Session: Women in Logic Programming: This special session=
  will include
    invited talks and presentations by women in logic programming.
=E2=80=A2 Research Challenges in Logic Programming Track: This track invite=
s submissions
    of papers describing research challenges that an individual researcher o=
r a
    research group is currently attacking. The goal of the track is to promo=
te
    discussions, exchange of ideas, and possibly stimulate new collaboration=
s.
    Papers submitted to this track do not go through the usual review and wi=
ll not
    be published in the proceedings =E2=80=93 they will be distributed at th=
e conference as
    a technical report.
Every of the above four tracks will have its own dedicated chairs, PC, eval=
uation
criteria, and CFP with related submission details (see the specific call fo=
r papers).

In addition to the presentations of accepted papers, the technical program =
will
include invited talks, advanced tutorials, the doctoral consortium, and sev=
eral
workshops.

Submission Details
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
All submissions must be made via the EasyChair conference system:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Diclp20200.

Regular papers must be in the condensed TPLP format (template here) and not=
  exceed
14 pages including bibliography. Regular papers may be supplemented with ap=
pendices
for proofs and details of datasets which do not count towards the page limi=
t and
which will not be made available as appendices to the published paper.

Three kinds of regular papers will be accepted:
=E2=80=A2 Technical papers for technically sound, innovative ideas that can=
  advance the
    state of logic programming;
=E2=80=A2 Application papers that impact interesting application domains;
=E2=80=A2 System and tool papers which emphasize novelty, practicality, usa=
bility, and
    availability of the systems and tools described.
Application, system, and tool papers need to be clearly marked in their tit=
le.

All submissions must be written in English and describe original, previousl=
y
unpublished research, and must not simultaneously be submitted for publicat=
ion
elsewhere. These restrictions do not apply to previously accepted workshop =
papers
with a limited audience and/or without archival proceedings.

Papers of the highest quality will be selected to be published in the journ=
al of
Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Cambridge University Press=
  (CUP).
In order to ensure the quality of the final version, papers may be subject =
to more
than one round of refereeing (within the decision period).

The program committee may recommend some regular papers to be published as =
Technical
communications in EPTCS format (http://info.eptcs.org). Technical communica=
tions must
not exceed 14 pages, including the bibliography. The authors of the technic=
al
communications can also elect to convert their submissions into extended ab=
stracts,
of 2 or 3 pages, for inclusion in the EPTCS proceedings. This should allow =
authors
to submit a long version elsewhere.

All regular papers and technical communications will be presented during th=
e
conference. So, at least one author per accepted paper is expected to regis=
ter and
attend the conference. Authors of accepted papers will, by default, be auto=
matically
included in the list of ALP members, who will receive quarterly updates fro=
m the
Logic Programming Newsletter at no cost.

Doctoral Consortium
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The 16th Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming provides students wi=
th the
opportunity to present and discuss their research directions, and to obtain=
  feedback
from both peers and experts in the field. Accepted participants will receiv=
e partial
financial support to attend the event and the main conference. The best pap=
er from
the DC will be given the opportunity to make a presentation in a session of=
  the main
ICLP conference.
The DC will have its own CFP, including the submission details. For informa=
tion,
please visit the DC Web Page.

Workshops
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The ICLP 2020 program will include several workshops. They are perhaps the =
best places
for the presentation of preliminary work, underdeveloped novel ideas, and n=
ew open
problems to an interested audience with opportunities for intensive discuss=
ions and
project collaborations.

Tutorials
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The ICLP 2020 program will include several tutorials. They offer the partic=
ipants,
reviews of specific subfields as well as hands-on sessions by leading exper=
ts.
