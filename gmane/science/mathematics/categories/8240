Dear Adam,=20

I don't have much time right now and have not read your paper carefully. =
However, to elaborate on David Roberts's answer, in my work about the =
homotopy theory of 2-categories, the property which I have found the =
most useful (and which shows up in many natural circonstances) is the =
following. Given a 2-category A, let us say that an object z of A has a =
terminal object if Hom(a,z) has a terminal object for every object a of =
A. This terminology was suggested to me by Jean B=E9nabou. It is of =
course compatible with the usual definition if the 2-category happens to =
be Cat. It can be shown that, if a small 2-category A admits such an =
object, then the map from A to the point is a weak equivalence, i.e. its =
nerve is a simplicial weak equivalence. I have some papers around =
related stuff, which I could communicate when they are in their final =
version.=20

This property of having such an object has already been considered in =
the literature, for instance in Bunge's "Coherent extensions and =
relational algebras", Jay's "Local adjunctions" and Betti-Power's "On =
local adjointness of distributive bicategories". Thanks to Steve Lack =
for having pointed out my attention to this last paper. You may also =
find useful this question and its answers on Math Overflow: =

t-enriched-category/161118#161118.=20
