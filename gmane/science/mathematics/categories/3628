                        Second Call for Papers

           23rd International Conference on Logic Programming
                               ICLP 2007
                 Porto, Portugal, September 8-13, 2007
                    http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/iclp07/

Conference Scope

Since the first  conference held in Marseilles in  1982, ICLP has been
the premier international conference  for presenting research in logic
programming.  Contributions (papers  and  posters) are  sought in  all
areas of logic programming including but not restricted to:

- Theory: Semantic Foundations, Formalisms, Nonmonotonic Reasoning,
   Knowledge Representation.

- Implementation: Compilation, Memory Management, Virtual Machines,
   Parallelism.

- Environments: Program Analysis, Program Transformation, Validation
   and Verification, Debugging, Profiling.

- Language Issues: Concurrency, Objects, Coordination, Mobility,
   Higher Order, Types, Modes, Programming Techniques.

- Alternative Paradigms: Abductive Logic Programming, Answer Set
   Programming, Constraint Logic Programming, Inductive Logic
   Programming, Alternative Inference Engines and Mechanisms.

- Applications: Deductive Databases, Data Integration, Software
   Engineering, Natural Language, Web Tools, Internet Agents,
   Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics.

The three broad categories  for submissions are: (1) technical papers,
where  specific  attention  will  be  given to  work  providing  novel
integrations of the areas  listed above, (2) application papers, where
the  emphasis will be  on their  impact on  the application  domain as
opposed  to  the advancement  of  the  the  state-of-the-art of  logic
programming,  and (3)  posters,  ideal for  presenting and  discussing
current work not  yet ready for publication, for  PhD thesis summaries
and research project overviews.

In addition to papers and  posters, the technical program will include
invited talks, tutorials, a Doctoral Consortium, and workshops.


Papers and Posters

Papers  and  posters must  describe  original, previously  unpublished
research,  and must  not simultaneously  be submitted  for publication
elsewhere.   They   must  be   written  in  English.    Technical  and
application  papers must  not exceed  15  pages in  the Springer  LNCS
format.  The limit for posters is 2 pages in the same format.

The primary means of submission is electronic. Papers and posters must
be submitted at http://www.easychair.org/ICLP2007/.


Publication

It   is  expected   that  the   proceedings  will   be   published  by
Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series.  All accepted papers and abstracts
of accepted posters will be included in the proceedings.


Important Dates

Paper registration deadline:   March 2, 2007
Submission deadline:           March 9, 2007
Notification of authors:       May 4, 2007
Camera-ready copy due:         June 8, 2007

Workshops

The ICLP'07 program will  include several workshops.  They are perhaps
the best place for the  presentation of preliminary work, novel ideas,
and new  open problems to  a wide and interested  audience.  Workshops
also   provide  a   venue  for   presenting  specialized   topics  and
opportunities for  intensive discussions and  project collaboration in
any areas  related to logic  programming, including cross-disciplinary
areas.    You    can    find     the    call    for    proposals    in
http://www.dimi.uniud.it/dovier/WICLP07/.

Workshop proposal submission deadline: February 14, 2007.


Doctoral Consortium

The  Doctoral  Consortium  (DC)  on  Logic Programming  is  the  third
doctoral  consortium  to  be   offered  as  part  of  ICLP  conference
series. The  DC builds  on the experience  of the  previous successful
consortiums (held in Sitges, Spain  and in Seattle, WA) during ICLP-05
and ICLP-06. The DC is designed for doctoral students working in areas
related  to logic  and  constraint programming,  who  are planning  to
pursue a career  in academia. The DC also  considers applications from
Master's   students  pursuing  projects   in  logic   programming  and
interested in  entering a  doctoral program.  The  Doctoral Consortium
aims to  provide students with  an opportunity to present  and discuss
their research directions  and to obtain feedbacks from  peers as well
as world-renown  experts in the  field.  The Doctoral  Consortium will
also offer  invited speakers and panels  discussions. More information
can be found at http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~epontell/DC2007/.


Conference Venue

ICLP  2007 will  be  held in  the  city of  Porto,  second largest  in
Portugal.  Porto is located by the Douro river and the Atlantic, has a
truly unique appearance with  many striking bridges, a historic center
classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage site, a new House of Music by
Rem Koolhaas  and a  nice Museum of  Modern Art (Museu  de Serralves).
Porto is  also well known for  the much celebrated Port  wine grown in
the Douro valley.   The conference will feature a  cruise in the Douro
river along with other optional tours.

The Conference will take place in the Hotel "Le Meridien Park Atlantic
Porto".
