Now that the question of finiteness as been reactivated here,
may I bring up again the following question  ?
 
What concept of finiteness is appropriate for those important
mathematical applications in topology for which K/S doesn't
seem right ? (For example the equalizer closure of K/S or...??)
Especially, a suitably "finite" module should be a vector bundle
or a FAC in the sense of Serre so that our simplified topos theory
could apply more directly to those things it should.
