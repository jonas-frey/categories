Seventh Workshop on
MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
Sunday 8th July 2018, Oxford, UK
A satellite workshop of FSCD 2018

http://msfp2018.bentnib.org/

     CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Registration:
============

Register here: http://www.floc2018.org/register/
Early registration deadline: Wednesday 6th June


Invited Speakers:
=================

   - Tamara von Glehn, University of Cambridge, UK
   - Didier Remy, INRIA, France



The seventh workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional
Programming is devoted to the derivation of functionality from
structure. It is a celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical
Computer Science on programs as we write them today. Modern
programming languages, and in particular functional languages, support
the direct expression of mathematical structures, equipping
programmers with tools of remarkable power and abstraction. Where
would Haskell be without monads? Functional reactive programming
without temporal logic?  Call-by-push-value without adjunctions? The
list goes on. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to
reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.

The first MSFP workshop was held in Kuressaare, Estonia, in July 2006,
affiliated with MPC 2006 and AMAST 2006. The second MSFP workshop was
held in Reykjavik, Iceland as part of ICALP 2008. The third MSFP
workshop was held in Baltimore, USA, as part of ICFP 2010. The fourth
workshop was held in Tallinn, Estonia, as part of ETAPS 2012. The
fifth workshop was held in Grenoble, France, as part of ETAPS
2014. The sixth MSFP Workshop was held in April 2016, in Eindhoven,
Netherlands, just after ETAPS 2016.
