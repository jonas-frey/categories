Representations of 2-groups are nice examples of symmetric monoidal
bicategories with non-trivial coherence data (the "15j" symbols which
categorify the "6j symbols" from representation categories of groups). See
eg. "2-group representations for spin foams", by Baratin and Wise for a
pointer to further literature, http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1542.

Bruce Bartlett
