CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

11th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction (MPC=
  2012)
Madrid, Spain, 25-27 June 2012

http://babel.ls.fi.upm.es/mpc2012

Hotel rooms reserved until:  *** 30th May 2012 ***
Early registration deadline: *** 6th June 2012 ***


BACKGROUND

The biennial MPC conferences aim to promote the development of
mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical
and effective in the process of constructing computer programs,
broadly interpreted. The 2012 MPC conference will be held in Madrid,
Spain, from 25th to 27th June 2012.


VENUE

The conference will take place in Madrid, the capital of Spain, in the
Sala de Grados of the Facultad de Inform=C3=A1tica of Universidad
Complutense de Madrid, right in Madrid's Ciudad Universitaria (city
campus), not far from the city centre and other major tourist
attractions. Accommodation has been reserved in a nearby 4-star hotel,
the VP Jardin Metropolitano.


REGISTRATION

Conference registration is now open; see

   http://babel.ls.fi.upm.es/mpc2012/registration.html

Registration fees have been kept low thanks to a grant from the
Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad. The early
registration fee is =E2=82=AC240, which includes lunches, coffees, and so=
cial
events.  The early registration deadline is 6th June 2012; after this
point, the registration fee rises to =E2=82=AC340.

Hotel reservation is handled separately; see

   http://babel.ls.fi.upm.es/mpc2012/accom.html

We have a block booking of rooms at the conference hotel at a special
reduced rate, but only until 30th May 2012; after this point, the
rooms will be released and the special rate unavailable.  (There are
few well-connected budget hotels in the area, and June marks the start
of Spain's tourist season with a sharp rise in hotel rates; so we
strongly advise you to meet this hotel registration deadline.)
