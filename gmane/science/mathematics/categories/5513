Dear Andre,

You are absolutely right that the equality relation is inseparable from
the idea of a set.  What is being proposed, however, is that a category
doesn't need to have a *set* of objects.  In fact, the objects of a
category don't need to form an object of any category at all, so I think
your proposed test is misguided.  The formulation of category theory in
dependent type theory which Richard, Toby, I, and others are proposing
makes perfect sense without any equality predicate for the objects.

Best,
Mike
