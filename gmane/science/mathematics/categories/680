                         CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                 Workshop on Internet Programming Languages

               in conjunction with the IEEE Computer Society 
            International Conference on Computer Languages 1998
                       Loyola University Chicago
                             Chicago, USA
                    http://www.math.luc.edu/iccl98

                            May 13, 1998

The Internet has long provided a global computing infrastructure but, for most 
of its history, there has not been much interest in programming languages 
tailored specifically to that infrastructure. More recently, the Web has 
produced a widespread interest in global resources and, as a consequence, in 
global programmability. It is now commonplace to discuss how programs can be 
made to run effectively and securely over the Internet.

This workshop will provide a forum for the discussions of all aspects of 
computer languages for wide-area systems, including specification languages, 
programming languages, semantics, implementation technologies, and application 
experience.
