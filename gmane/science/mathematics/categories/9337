Dear Eduardo,=0A=
=0A=
Thank you for recalling this remarkable article by Thurston.=0A=
It contains profound observations on the role of *communities* in the creat=
ion of mathematics.=0A=
Mathematical research is about developing *human understanding* of mathemat=
ics.=0A=
=0A=
Thurston does not mention category theory.=0A=
I remember trying to learn algebraic topology by reading the =0A=
"Foundations of Algebraic Topology" by Eilenberg and Steenrod. =0A=
It is a great book, but not the right place to learn the subject.=0A=
I also tried to learn algebraic geometry by reading the =0A=
"Elements de Geometrie Algebrique" by Grothendieck and Dieudonn=E9.=0A=
I never became an algebraic-geometer.=0A=
It is very difficult to learn anything without direct access to the people =
who knows.=0A=

Best,=0A=

1) Two days ago by chance I come across an article of Bill Thurston:=0A=
=0A=
https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236.pdf=0A=
=0A=
and seeing his name mentioned in this thread it occurs to me that=0A=
everybody in this list should read it. In my opinion it is an=0A=
extraordinary document about mathematics, mathematical activity and=0A=
mathematicians.=0A=
=0A=
2) Respect to to subject of this thread, the formal opposite of a=0A=
category, denoted "op", is simply a notation very useful to work with=0A=
functors which are contravariant in some variables, either with the "op"=0A=
in the domain or the codomain of the functor arrow.=0A=
=0A=
Notations are important, and the "op" notation is essential in the=0A=
language of categories and functors.=0A=
=0A=
3) Finally, concerning Fred Linton, his death sadness me, he did=0A=
important work in the early days of category theory, but more important,=0A=
he was one of us, it was always a pleasure to encounter him, an he was a=0A=
good guy.=0A=
=0A=
all the best   e.d.=0A=
