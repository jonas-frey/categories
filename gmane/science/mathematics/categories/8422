The Eduard Cech center had been established in 2005 and, since 2012, it  continues as the national
research center focusing its attention to interactions between algebra, geometry, and mathematical
physics. The participating institutions are Faculty of Science of Masaryk University in Brno,
Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University in Prague, Institute of Physics
of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and the Mathematics Institute of the Silesian
University in Opava (see http://eci.sci.muni.cz).

The Center invites applications for several research positions commencing during the academic year
2015/2016 at the date depending on mutual agreement. The positions are initially for one year
with a possibility of extension. The candidates must be recent PhD's and should submit a letter
of application accompanied by a CV, list of publications and an outline of their research project
to Professor Jiri Rosicky (rosicky@math.muni.cz) not later than

                                        March 15, 2015.

They should also arrange for at least 2 letters of recommendation (one can be from a Czech
mathematician) to be mailed directly to rosicky@math.muni.cz before March 15, 2015. The successful
applicants will be notified as soon as possible but not later than April 30, 2015.
