Al Vilcius asks:

and most people reply along the lines of:

> non-trivial subalgebras.

> Coinduction says, dually, that the final coalgebra has no
non-trivial
> quotients.

but wouldn't it be nice to keep the standard definition of
induction, which says that the equations

    f(0) = c
    f(n+1) = g(f(n))

determine a unique f, given c and g? this is the definition that
most first year students study, and many programmers use every
day, usually without the slightest idea about subalgebras, or
triviality. do we really gain anything by replacing this simple
scheme by the higher-order statement about all subalgebras? ok,
we do get the appearance of symmetry between induction and
coinduction. but is the higher-order statement about quotients
really the friendliest form of coinduction, suitable to be taken
as the definition?

i think barwise and moss somewhere describe coinduction as
*induction without the base case*. the coinduction principle
says that the equation

    X = a.X + bc.X

determines a unique CCS-process, or a unique {a,b,c}-labelled
hyperset. it also guarantees that the integral equation

    E(x) = 1 + \int_0^x E dt

has a unique solution. (note that this is equivalent to the
differential equation

    E(0) = 1
    E = E'

where the initial condition gives the base case for the power
series solution. so the no-base-case slogan is just a matter of
form? but note that  E' = E, and more generally E' = h(E), for
an analytic h, identifies two *infinite* streams, and is not a
mere inductive step up the stream.)

in any case, i contend that the practice of coinduction
primarily consists of solving *guarded equations*, like the two
above --- surely if you count the areas where people extensively
use coinduction, without calling it by name, viz math analysis.

((it is true that computer scientists became aware of
coinduction while working out the bisimulations etc, which is
why the quotients came in light. but now it seems that the
bisimulations were just the way to construct final coalgebras;
whereas the coinduction, in analogy with the induction, should
be a practically useful logical principle, available over the
*given* final coalgebras.))

anyway, the heart of the matter probably lies in peter aczel's
insight that the statement

     * V ---> PV is a final coalgebra for P = (finite) powerset
functor

equivalently means that

    * every accessible pointed graph has a unique decoration in
V.

presenting the graph definitions as systems of guarded equations
(like in barwise and moss' book "vicious circles"), the above
equivalence generalizes to the statement that

    * V --d--> FV is a final coalgebra for F

iff

    * every system of guarded equations over V has a unique
solution.

where the notion of guarded is determined by F and d. this is,
of course, just barwise and moss' solution lemma, lifted to F.
or more succinctly : **V is a final fixpoint iff each guarded
operation g:V-->V has a unique fixpoint**

this, of course, supports the view that ***coinduction is
solving guarded equations***...

i was hoping to say more, but will have to leave it for later,
and post this hoping to motivate discussion.

PS i have a great appreciation for jan rutten's work on
coinduction, but it seems to me that the title of *universal
coalgebra* is a bit exaggerated. universal algebra does not
dualize. by design, it is meant to be model theory of algebraic
theories. what would be the "coalgebraic theories", leading to
coalgebras as their models? what would their functorial
semantics look like?  (implicitly, these questions are already
in manes' book.)

and then, moving from coalgebraic theories to comonads, like
from algebraic theories to monads, should presumably yield an
HSP-like characterization for the categories of (comonad)
coalgebras. but coalgebras for a comonad over a topos usually
form just another topos.

i may be missing something essential here, but then i do stand
to be corrected.
