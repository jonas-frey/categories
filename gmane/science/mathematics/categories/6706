A few days ago, I asked where in the literature I could find the fact tha=
t=20
the codensity monad of the inclusion FinSet --> Set is the ultrafilter=20
monad.  Michel Hebert replied:

Thanks very much, Michel.  The references to Lawvere's thesis (Section=20
III, Theorem 2) and Linton's 1966 La Jolla paper (Section 2) seem to be=20
general references for the structure-semantics adjunction, which is what=20
the earlier parts of the exercise are about.  The word "ultrafilter" does=
=20
not appear in either Lawvere or Linton.

So I currently believe that Manes was the first to publish this fact.  If=
=20
someone knows better (perhaps Bill, Fred, Anders Kock or Myles Tierney), =
I=20
hope they will let me know.

(I suspect that John Isbell would have known it, at some level, when he=20
wrote his 1960 paper "Adequate subcategories", even though the language o=
f=20
monads wasn't available then.  But I haven't found it mentioned in his=20
words; Manes's exercise is the only written reference to this fact that I=
=20
know of.)

Incidentally, I've learned how many names the codensity monad has had=20
through history: it has also been called the model-induced monad/triple=20
(e.g. by Appelgate and Tierney), the coadequacy monad/triple (e.g. by=20
Lawvere), and the algebraic completion (e.g. by Manes).

Thanks to all who replied.

Best wishes,
Tom
