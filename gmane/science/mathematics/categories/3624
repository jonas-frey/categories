PhD Position in Leicester, UK
-----------------------------------------

The Department of Computer Science of the University of Leicester offers
three PhD studentships (GTA). The GTA scheme involves some teaching and
runs for 4 years. Unfortunately, the university waives the fees only for
EU nationals.

One of the positions will be in the area of Theoretical Computer Science
under the supervision of Alexander Kurz. Colleagues in Leicester working
on related topics include Nick Bezhanishvili, Roy Crole, Reiko Heckel,
Vincent Schmitt, Emilio Tuosto, and Fer-Jan de Vries.  Moreover, there
will be close collaboration with the logic groups at the University of
Amsterdam (in particular with the VICI-project directed by Yde Venema at
ILLC) and at the University of Oxford (Hilary Priestley, Alexandru Baltag).
