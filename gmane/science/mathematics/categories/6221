Sorry, Toby, when I see "such as x and x" I have to struggle to
treat the expression between "as" and "and" as anything other than
different from the expression following the "and" -- for, if they
were really the same, there would be but one expression, not two,
it would be in one of those positions only, not both (I'm put in mind =

of the good old "Cheech and Chong"-ism, "How can you be in two places =

at once, if you're not anywhere at all?"), and you'd have used not =

the plural verb form "are" but the singular "is".

An illustration from another realm: each time the clerk behind the deli =

counter finishes with one customer and shouts "Next!" so as to bring up =

another one, the expression the clerk shouts refers to an entirely =

different customer than it did the time just before.

Again I'm puzzled: what can fst(x,y) (where fst: A x B -> A is as you say=
)
possibly have to do with x (as in A x B, presumably -- or did you mean
as in fst(x,y), which could be problematic for void B)?

Sorry to be so obtuse, but ...; cheers, -- Fred
