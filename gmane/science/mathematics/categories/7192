           CMCS 2012 call for participation and short contributions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----


The 11th International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Scienc=
e
                31 March - 1 April 2012, Tallinn, Estonia
                        co-located with ETAPS 2012
                           www.coalg.org/cmcs12

Aims and scope
--------------

In more than a decade of research, it has been established that a wide
variety of state-based dynamical systems, like transition systems,
automata (including weighted and probabilistic variants), Markov
chains, and game-based systems, can be treated uniformly as
coalgebras. Coalgebra has developed into a field of its own interest
presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a growing field of
applications, and interactions with various other fields such as
reactive and interactive system theory, object-oriented and concurrent
programming, formal system specification, modal and description
logics, artificial intelligence, dynamical systems, control systems,
category theory, algebra, analysis, etc. The aim of the CMCS workshop
series is to bring together researchers with a common interest in the
theory of coalgebras, their logics, and their applications.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

   * the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
     approaches);
   * coalgebras as computational and semantic models (for programming
     languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
   * coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
   * coalgebras and data types;
   * (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
     bisimulations or invariants);
   * coalgebras and algebras;
   * coalgebraic specification and verification;
   * coalgebras and (modal) logic;
   * coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event and hybrid
     systems).

Registration
------------

Registration is handled via the ETAPS website; please visit=20

http://www.etaps.org/2012/registration

Keynote Speaker
---------------

Samson Abramsky, Oxford University, UK

Invited Speakers
----------------

Marcello Bonsangue,  Leiden University, The Netherlands
Pawel Sobocinski, University of Southampton, UK

Submission of Short Contributions
---------------------------------

Submission is electronic via the easychair system at

   http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcmcs2012

following the submission guidelines below. Submission of regular
papers is closed. The submission deadline for short contributions is
February 20, 2012 (but see below under 'Important Dates'). Short
contributions will be bundled in a technical report. They should be
no more than two pages in LNCS format and may describe work in
progress, summarise work submitted to a conference or workshop
elsewhere, or in some other way appeal to the CMCS audience.


Important dates=20
---------------

* 20 February 2012: submission deadline for short contributions=20
* 25 February 2012: author notification for short contributions
* 26 February 2012: ETAPS normal registration deadline
* 31 March - 1 April 2012: the workshop=20

We continue to accept short contributions (with notfication one week
after submisssion) until Februrary 27 based on avaliability of slots.
However, please note that the ETAPS normal registration deadline is
February 26.
