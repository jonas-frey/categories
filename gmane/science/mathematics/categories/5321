It is easy to criticise others but I think there is a general problem=20
with mathematics teaching (in my limited experience in the UK)
of mathematicians not explaining what the subject is about, or even=20
thinking that this is necessary, or useful. I would like to direct=20
attention to our
`Knot exhibition'
http://www.popmath.org.uk/exhib/knotexhib.html
and the discussion of what we were trying to achieve in
http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/icmi89.html  :
in broad terms, this was to show through the medium of knots some of the=20
methodology of mathematics. The advantages of knots for this aim are many=
.

In some ways the spirit of this exhibit is expressed by the slogan
`advanced mathematics from an elementary viewpoint'.
So how much of the baggage can you throw away and still get to, say, a=20
real calculation?
I once did a sample Todd-Coxeter enumeration of a presentation of a=20
finite group of order 8  to a class of unprepared 14 year olds,=20
(fortunately
I was prepared to do this!) and had them helping me  fill in the table=20
(just as well , too) and draw the Cayley graph.

I feel there is a real hunger in the public and in other sciences to=20
find out what is going on in mathematics which has some kind of excitemen=
t,
preferably in terms of new ideas, rather than solving say the Goldbach=20
Conjecture. Higher dimensional algebra is quite useful in this respect.
One can discuss what is or should be a higher dimensional formula, and=20
why the idea  might, or might not, be relevant to brain function! (I've=20
done this too for an audience of neuroscientists.)

Also discussed  in
http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/promotingmaths.html
is the heretical idea of `promoting mathematics' to students of=20
mathematics!

The point I am getting at is that there may be  something we can do about
`But generally, science documentaries are disappointing, and maths ones
even more so.' as suggested by Robert, and the start may be conveying=20
certain attitudes to the many
students studying mathematics seriously. Is this done enough?

Perhaps those interested in category theory are in a better position to=20
deal with these problems than those with no such interest!!???
