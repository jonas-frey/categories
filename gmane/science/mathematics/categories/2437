The inclusion of double-negation sheaves is an example of what I
called a sub-open map in my paper "Open maps of toposes"
(Manuscripta Math. 31 (1980), 217-247). Sub-open maps have the
property that their inverse image functors commute with implication
-- indeed, one could take that as a definition, although it
wasn't how I defined them in the paper.
