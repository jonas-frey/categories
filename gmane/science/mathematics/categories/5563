The model-theoretic meaning of the descent theorem is in section 11 of

Marek Zawadowski, Descent and duality. Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 71(2), s.
131-188, 1995.

In few words, it says that the formulas of the 'larger' theory invariant
under the
homomorphisms of the 'smaller' theory 'comes' from that smaller theory.
Some other relevant papers to this approach

Michael Makkai, Duality and Definability in First Order Logic, Mem. Of
AMS, no 503, (1993).

Marek Zawadowski, Lax descent theorems for left exact categories.
Dissertationes Math. 346,  (1995).

David Ballard, William Boshuck,Definability and Descent. Journal of
Symbolic Logic 63 (2):372-378, (1998).
