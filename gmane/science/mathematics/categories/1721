Dear All,

Philippe's question may be answered in part by looking 
at the construction by Baues and Dugundji (Trans Amer Math Soc 140
(1969) 239 - 256). Another point is that in the homotopical applications
it is not that the Ore condition is satisfied but that it is satisfied
up to homotopy that counts. A discussion of this in at least one case is
to be found on pages 90 - 111 of the book by Heiner Kamps and myself.
(see my homepage for the detailed coordinates if you want. The set
theoretic question was looked at by various people including Markus
Pfenniger in an unpublished manuscript in 1989.
