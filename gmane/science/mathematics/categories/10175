AI Secure and Explainable by Construction:

Multiple Research Positions (3 Doctoral, 5 Post-doctoral)

available at Heriot-Watt, Edinburgh and Strathclyde Universities,
Scotland, UK.

Start date: 1 September 2020; End date: 30 August 2023

Postdoctoral Salary Scale: ??31,866 to ??40,322 per annum

PhD funding: covering PhD fees and stipend for 3.5 years

Closing date for Postdoctoral applications: 1 June 2020


We encourage interested applicants to contact us informally ASAP.

The project has sufficient flexibility to mitigate the effect of
COVID-19, i.e. by accommodating later start date and remote working.


The project spans several subjects: type theory, automated and
interactive theorem proving, security, AI and machine learning,
autonomous systems, natural language processing and generation, legal
aspects of AI. It will cover two main application areas: autonomous cars
and chatbots, drawing from expertise and infrastructure provided by
industrial partners working in these two areas. The project has a
significant international span, with 12 partners from Academia and
Industry in Europe (France, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway)
and the US. Researchers joining this project will have excellent
opportunities to travel to international conferences, organise
scientific events, spend time with industrial partners, collaborate with
academic leaders in the field, develop their own research profiles as
well as gain experience in other AI and CS disciplines.
