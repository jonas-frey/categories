If this has an answer I'd like to know.  In my paper

Pratt, V.R. ``Communes via Yoneda, from an Elementary Perspective'',
Fundamenta Informaticae 103, 203-218, DOI 10.3233/FI-2010-325,
IOS Press, 2010

which among other things generalizes it in section 1.5 to the Chu
setting, I treated it as part of the uncitable Yoneda folklore.

Why uncitable?  Well, one of the many Norbert Weiner stories is that he
was challenged in class on some point.  He stared at the board for a
bit, wandered outside, came back twenty minutes later and said "It's
obvious."

The Yoneda lemma is like that.
