Dear Toby,

Thank you for your reply. Of course I am aware of this construction.

A setoid is the intensional representation of a quotient (ie =20
coequalizer) and any construction involving it should respect this =20
structure. To use the underlying set of a setoid to construct another =20=

set seems fundamentally flawed.

My understanding of an arrow category is that it's objects are the =20
morphisms of  the underlying category and since this is a setoid =20
objects should be represented as a setoid too.

You may say that we are only interested in objects upto isomorphism. =20
But what does this mean precisely?

Cheers,
Thorsten
