Hello Michael,

I believe that category theory is an excellent foundation for ontology 
representation and manipulation -- I use it myself.

However, choosing this foundation comes at a price.  Unless significant 
work is done to hide this unfamiliar foundation, many users (of the theory, 
the system, the language, &c) will be biased against the work from 
minute-one.  This has as much to do with the unfamiliarity of CT as it does 
with certain unfortunate negative biases regularly expressed by many 
mathematicians and computer scientists - biases that, IMHO, are founded in 
ignorance and not reason.

Many computer scientists, mathematician, and users of knowledge 
representation systems are quite familiar (at least in use, but probably 
not in foundations or related complications) and comfortable with set 
theory.  This familiarity is an incentive rather than an obstacle to using 
related work.

Personally, I chose not to pursue a set theoretical foundation because of 
theoretical and representational complexity issues (e.g. witness the use of 
a set theoretical foundation for the Z specification language) as well as 
the unfortunate binding to a particular formalism that isn't necessarily 
congruent with others that I work in and apply my work to (e.g. type theory 
and programming languages).  To rephrase, I find using CT to be more clear 
and tractable than set theory and I feel that my work can, as a result, say 
and do more than it could if it had a set theory (plus some extra 
formalisms) bases.

Note that I also chose not to build my work (solely) on type theory and 
order sorted algebras for the same reason, though my work has elements of 
both of those fields as well.

The comments about Ontolingua and KIF are on-target in my experience.  I 
see no obstructions to the representation of CKML (the variant related to 
KIF and RDF that I happen to know well) with my work.

Finally, I should point out that I am but an infant in CT - I'm much more 
comfortable with TT, OSA, PL, and others.  I've only been learning and 
using CT for a few months and, while there have been some objection to my 
choice, I feel that a dissertation founded in these three major fields (CT, 
TT, and OSA) has significantly broader application and, implicitly, more to 
say about its author. <grin>

Best,
Joe Kiniry
