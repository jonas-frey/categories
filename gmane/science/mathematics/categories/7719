Hi, Emily,

Have you or your grad student noticed the example got by taking as your
locally presentable category C the category of sets, and as your monad M =
the
ultrafilter or Stone-Cech monad =DF (with the Eilenberg-Moore category of=

=DF-algebras being the category of compact Hausdorff spaces (and continuo=
us
maps))?

Here, your "objects those X in C such that the unit X -> MX is an isomorp=
hism"
are just the finite sets, and, unless I misunderstand your limits questio=
n, I
fear that only finite limits will work as you desire.

Does that help in any way? Cheers, -- Fred =
