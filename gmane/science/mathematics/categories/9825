**************************************************************
First Call for Submissions

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
HOMOTOPY TYPE THEORY

12-17 August 2019
Carnegie Mellon University
Pittsburgh USA

https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2019

**************************************************************

Submissions of talks are now open for the International Homotopy Type
Theory conference (HoTT 2019), to be held from August 12th to 17th,
2019, at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA.  Contributions
are welcome in all areas related to homotopy type theory, including
but not limited to:

* Homotopical and higher-categorical semantics of type theory
* Synthetic homotopy theory
* Applications of univalence and higher inductive types
* Cubical type theories and cubical models
* Formalization of mathematics and computer science in homotopy type
theory / univalent foundations

Please submit 1-paragraph abstracts through the EasyChair
conference system here:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hott2019

The submission deadline is 1 APRIL 2019; we expect to notify accepted
submissions by 1 May.  If you need an earlier decision for some reason
(e.g. to apply for funding), please submit your abstract by 15 MARCH
and send an email to hott2019conference@gmail.com notifying us that
you need an early decision.

This conference is run on the "mathematics model" rather than the
"computer science model": full papers will not be submitted,
submissions will not be refereed, and submission is not a publication
(although a proceedings volume might be organized afterwards).  More
information, including registration, accomodation options, and travel,
will be available as the conference approaches at the web site
https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2019/ .

Please email hott2019conference@gmail.com with any questions.
