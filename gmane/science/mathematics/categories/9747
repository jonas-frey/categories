Applications are invited for postdoctoral position in the Tulane Computer 
Science department. The position is part of the on-going MURI project, 
Semantics and Tools for High-level Functional Quantum Programming 
Languages whose focus is on developing semantic models and tools to 
support high-level quantum functional programming languages. A prototype 
is Proto-Quipper ( http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/ ). 
Proto-Quipper and its dialects are typed languages employing the circuit 
model for quantum computation that follows the quantum computation under 
classical control paradigm. The goal is type-safe functional programming 
languages for quantum computing. The project also involves developing the 
meta-theory (including categorical semantics) of such languages, and 
formalizing some of the meta-theory in a proof assistant. The focus of the 
Tulane work has been adding term recursion and recursive types to models 
for these languages. Our work has been based on the linear/nonlinear 
categorical models first devised by Benton for linear logic, from which 
the ingredients needed to model circuit description languages have been 
extracted. We currently have a model supporting term recursion, and a 
model supporting recursive intuitionistic types is nearing completion. The 
next goals include adding dynamic lifting and developing concrete models 
based on C*- and W*-algebras, and operator systems, more generally. An 
additional component of the work is to investigate contextuality as a 
resource for demonstrating quantum advantage. Although the position is 
based at Tulane, project members may travel to the other sites where work 
on this project is taking place. These include UPenn, UIowa, UMd and 
Stanford in the US, and McGill University and Dalhousie University in 
Canada and Oxford and Edinburgh in the UK. Funding for the project comes 
from the DOD and the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

Candidates can find more details at the application site, which can be 
found here: https://apply.interfolio.com/56794
The start date for the position is January, 2019, or as soon thereafter as 
possible. The project runs run through November 30, 2020.

Review of applications will continue until the position is filled, but to 
receive full consideration, applications should be received by December 
1st.
