The answer to Mamuka's question (1) is no. Observe first that YY/f^*(X)
is bounded over XX/X iff it's bounded over XX, since XX/X --> XX is
bounded. And one has:

Proposition: If Y has global support in YY and G is a bound for
YY/Y over XX, then \Sigma_Y(G) is a bound for YY over XX.

Proof: By assumption, any object B of YY/Y is a subquotient of some
object G \times Y^*f^*(I), with I an object of XX. But the Frobenius
reciprocity condition
\Sigma_Y(G\times Y^*f^*(I)) \cong \Sigma_Y(G) \times f^*(I)
holds, so \Sigma_Y(B) is a subquotient of \Sigma_Y(G)\times f^*(I).
Finally, since Y has global support, any object A of XX is a
quotient of \Sigma_Y(Y^*(A)) \cong A \times Y.

I have no thoughts at present about question (2).
