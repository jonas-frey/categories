Dear all,

Given a 2-category C, there is a 2-category C' and a normal lax =20
functor from C to C' such that, for any normal lax functor from C to =20
a 2-category D, there is a unique strict 2-functor from C' to D which =20=

makes the triangle commute. (To avoid any confusion: I take normal =20
lax functor to be what is defined in, say, p. 7 of the paper http://=20
arxiv.org/abs/0909.4229.)

Gray, in "Formal Category Theory", I,4.23, Appendix A (p. 92), gives =20
an analogous universal construction with respect to general oplax =20
functors, and refers the reader to B=E9nabou's unpublished lectures as =20=

a more general reference. I have seen a reference to Theorem 3.13 of =20
the Blackwell-Kelly-Power paper "Two-dimensional monad theory" (JPAA =20
59 (1989, 1-41), thanks to Matias del Hoyo for pointing that to me), =20
but I do not have it handy and I am unsure whether the general =20
theorem provides a much concrete description of the universal 2-=20
category in the particular case I am interested in (and I do not know =20=

whether the normalized case falls into its range of application).

Are there references dealing specifically with normalized (op)lax =20
functors? Is there an explicit description of this universal =20
construction I could refer to in the literature?

Thanks in advance!

Best wishes,

Jonathan=
