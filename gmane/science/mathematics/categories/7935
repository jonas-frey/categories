Dear Marco
If I understand the history=2C it is the term "simplicial sets" that was so=
mewhat misleading : Classically the simplicial complexes (based =2Cfrom a c=
ategorical view=2C actually on finite families not just finite subsets)
were an important combinatorial structure and indeed still are. Eilenberg a=
nd others  recognized the important role in topological calculations for "o=
rdered simplices " and the corresponding toposwas said to consist of "semis=
implicial sets". But then the prefixes were dropped !
It does not seem accurate to consider that there is  an "opposition "betwee=
n the ordered and unordered cases. They are just two subtoposesof the distr=
ibutive lattice classifier=2C which consists of presheaves onfinite posets.=
  The classifying topos point of view is helpful=2C because it is the choice=
  of an algebraic structure=2C of the kind classified=2C in a topological to=
pos that gives rise to an exact singular/realization pair. For example any =
topological distributive lattice gives rise to such =3Bif it happens to be =
totally ordered=2C these adjoint functors factor throughthe simplicial subt=
opos. But a boolean algebra whose operations are continuous represents a re=
alization that depends only on the subtoposthat depends only on the finite =
trivially ordered sets. The symmetry is concretely the action of boolean ne=
gation. The fact that any  distributive lattice space embeds in a boolean a=
lgebra space helps to relate these .
There are other subtoposes (i.e. strengthenings of the theory of distributi=
ve lattices)=2C so that precise calculation of the Aufhebung andof coHeytin=
g boundary should in particular be relevant to combinatorial topology.
There may be a connection with your earlier work that employed distributive=
  lattices in the analysis of diagrams. When one represents ageometric categ=
ory in presheaves on a subcategory P=2C it is helpful to consider that P pa=
rameterizes the basic figure shapes that determine the structureof a genera=
l object. In the category of categories=2C the basic figures arefinite comm=
utative diagrams=2C are they not ? Thus=2C if we do not insist on a minimal=
istic notion of nerve=2C distributive lattices emerge.
