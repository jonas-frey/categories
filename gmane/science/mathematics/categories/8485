Dear Bill, dear all,

this is terribly sad news. I feared the worst when Bob did not show up =
at Cambridge for CT2014, but hoped that it was just a wrong feeling.

The strongest and happiest link I had with Bob was in the organization =
of two major conferences at Como and Genova: in both occasions the many, =
strangely difficult tasks which we had to confront always appeared =
easier than they were because of his willingness to make things work and =
of his amazing sense of humour.=20

My image of Bob is forever connected to cartesian bicategories (I, II, =
III,...). They constitute landmarks in the research in mathematics, and =
I am certain they will prove fundamental in the philosophy of the =
subject in the decades to come. It is the saddest of thoughts that I =
shall not discuss it with him any more.

At this terrible moment my heart is with Nicoletta and Sofia.

Pino=
