I miss him very much. Especially because doing mathematics with him was =
a lot of fun. His humor, his naturalness, his spontaneity were like a =
force of nature. And I was very lucky as I could receive his harsh =
criticisms directly in his mother language, and respond.

And I always remember with joy the very long night we spent together, =
when we met at 6pm EST at the gate of a flight from JFK to Denver; =
coming from different places across the Atlantic, each had missed his =
connecting flight. For a technical problem, we then sat at the gate for =
four hours waiting for a replacement aircraft. We got to Denver at 4am =
MST, arriving in Boulder at 7am in time for breakfast. Yet he made it =
the most absolutely delightful trip for me.

Ciao!
