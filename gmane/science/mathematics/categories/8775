This is also an opportunity for me to remind you of the list policy from
the list web page at:

http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/

"The subject of this moderated mailing list is category theory. Items on
another subject may be posted if judged by the moderator to be of interest
to subscribers. Discussion of such posts is excluded. The list is to be
used for concise discussion that is suitable for email distribution. Posts
are not transmitted if, in the moderator's judgement, they are unsuitable
for distribution. Postings to the categories list will be courteous and
respectful. Expression of disagreement must be polite. A submission judged
by the moderator to be offensive or defamatory will not be posted.
Submissions judged to be related such material will not be posted.

The categories mailing list distributes only text messages. Do not send
attachments, messages containing html or excessively long postings (longer
than about 10K). The default setting for some email clients is to compose
messages containing html. This setting is easy to change. Postings with
attachments or with html will be discarded."

Best to all for 2016,
Bob Rosebrugh
