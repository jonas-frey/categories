Sorry, I seem to have confused the names pseudo-protofiltered and=20
protofiltered in the previous. I took "pseudo-protofiltered" as a suggested=
=20
name for connected and "span-directed", instead of just span-directed=20
(having V-cocones). But if you just ignore the "pseudo", this should not=20
disturb the content of my previous mail... i.e correction of previous, if=
=20
D-filtered means "commuting with D-limits" then:

2) If D is pullbacks (V-limits) then D-filtered=3Dpseudofiltered (and not=
=20
just pseudo-protofiltered) 3) If D is pullbacks and terminal objects=20
({V,=C3=98}-limits) then D-filtered=3Dfiltered (and not just protofiltered)

..sorry for the confusion..
