Dear colleagues, last year I gave a talk at the Eilenberg Centenary
Conference showing that sufficiently cohesive presheaf toposes cannot
satisfy Continuity (in the sense of Lawvere's 2007 paper), and also
sketching the construction of cohesive and sufficiently
cohesive (Grothendieck)  toposes. In case anyone is interested, details may
be found in the draft "Continuous Cohesion over sets" that can be
downloaded from

https://sites.google.com/site/matiasmenni/

Those interested in Axiomatic Cohesion may also want to have a look at
"Sufficient Cohesion over atomic toposes" also available there.

Looking forward to the next ct meeting, Mat=C3=ADas.
