Eduard Cech center had been established in 2005 as the national research
center focusing its attention to interactions between algebra, geometry, and
logic (and their applications in cryptology, computer science, etc.). It
is jointly operated by mathematicians from Masaryk University in Brno,
Charles University in Prague and Academy of Sciences of the Czech
Republic, with offices both in Brno and Prague.

The Center invites applications for several research positions for the year
2009, commencing at the date depending on mutual agreement. The candidates
must be recent PhD's that obtained their degree not earlier than 2 years
before the beginning of their contract with the Eduard Cech Center.

Candidates should submit a letter of application accompanied by a CV,
list of publications and an outline of their research project to
Professor Jan Slovak (slovak@muni.cz) not later than August 10, 2008.
They should also arrange for at least 2 letters of recommendation
(at most one can be from a Czech mathematician) to be mailed directly
to slovak@muni.cz before August 10, 2008. The successful applicants
will be notified as soon as possible but not later than September 20,
2008.
