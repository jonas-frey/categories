    PhD degrees in the Division of Informatics
    at the University of Edinburgh

In 1998, the University of Edinburgh established a Division of
Informatics, to study the structure, behaviour and
interactions of both natural and artificial computational systems.
The Division reflects the University's vision of Informatics
as a fundamental area of study, critical for the future developments
in science, engineering, and society. The Division was formed from
the former Departments of Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive
Science and Computer Science.

The Division has positions for new research degree students pursing
either an MSc(Research) (one year), an MPhil (two years) or a PhD
(three years) through investigation of open problems in Informatics.

The Division now contains about 70 academic staff, 60 contract researchers
and 150 research students, grouped primarily into these research
institutes:

        Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute
        Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation
        Institute for Communicating and Collaborative Systems
        Institute for Computing Systems Architecture
        Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour
        Institute for Representation and Reasoning
        Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science

which reflect the main research themes in the Division:

        adaptive computing
        artificial intelligence
        automated and mathematical reasoning
        cognitive science
        computational complexity
        computational learning theory
        computational linguistics
        computational musicology
        computational neuroscience
        computer-assisted formal reasoning
        computer architectures and networking
        computer communication and protocols
        computer graphics and virtual reality
        computer science
        computer vision
        database systems
        design and analysis of dependable systems
        diagramatic understanding
        formal program specification
        functional, logic and object-oriented programming
        genetic/evolutionary algorithms
        human-computer interaction
        intelligent tutoring systems
        knowledge representation and reasoning
        knowledge-based systems
        machine learning
        medical informatics
        mobile and assembly robotics
        modular and component-based systems
        natural language processing
        neural modelling
        neural networks
        neuroinformatics
        parallel, distributed and concurrent systems
        planning and activity management
        probabilistic graphical models
        program logics
        programming languages
        qualitative and fuzzy reasoning
        semantics of programming languages
        software engineering
        speech understanding and generation
        system level design and integration
        theory of computation
        type theory
                                        
The UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council
has awarded the Division about 8 full studentships
that can be used by UK and EC students. Overseas students
may be eligible for ORS awards, that pay approximately
half of the total costs.

In general, students should have a good BS/BSc degree (or equivalent)
in an appropriate topic, plus other skills appropriate to the particular
research area.
