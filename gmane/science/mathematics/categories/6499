Dear Jean (and Mike)=2C
Your guess/proof that anafunctors and representable distributors are equiva=
lent notions=2C and by an equivalence which extends to=A0an equivalence of =
categories between Rep(A=2CB) and Cat_ana(A=2CB)=2C is not only correct but=
  also fully discussed in:

http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/anafunctor

In that article=2C it is furthermore pointed out that each version has its =
advantages over the other=2C and that therefore both are of interest for ca=
tegory theory in a topos S without AC=2C where they generalize ordinary fun=
ctors.=A0But=2C even in the presence of AC=2C distributors (profunctors) ge=
neralize ordinary functors=2C a fact that I have known for 45 years=2C wher=
eas anafunctors do not. This ought to be pointed out by the authors of the =
article mentioned above.=A0
In my thesis ("Categories of Set-Valued Functors"=2C University of Pennsylv=
ania=2C 1966)=2C inspired by a monograph of Michel Andre ("Categories of Fu=
nctors and Adjoint Functors"=2C Batelle Report=2C Geneve=2C 1964)=2C I disc=
uss what you later called "distributors"=2C including their composition as =
a generalized matrix product. It was Bill Lawvere who pointed out to me the=
  importance of =A0"distributors"=2C well before you introduced them. I gave=
  an expose of a portion of my thesis at the Oberwolfach meeting in 1966. My=
  main interest therein was the equivalence between the category of profunct=
ors between two small categories and that of those functors between the cor=
responding set-valued functor categories that have an adjoint or a coadjoin=
t. In turn=2C this led to Morita equivalence theorems. The results are vali=
d for an arbitrary (co)complete topos S but=2C even in the case of Set=2C 
which satisfie=
s AC=2C this shows that profunctors generalize ordinary functors.=A0

With best regards to all=2C
Marta
