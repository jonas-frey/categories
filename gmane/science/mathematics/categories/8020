Dear Vasili,

I would say it is nothing to do with size issues, but stems from his stated a=
im of treating categories as algebraic structures. If you look at the algebr=
a of monoids, or of rings, you find that surjections are different from epis=
. Examples: if you take a monoid and freely adjoin inverses, then you get an=
  epi from the first to the second that is not in general a surjection. The r=
ing homomorphism from Z to Q is epi. Most algebraists would be more interest=
ed in the surjections than the epis, and I think Higgins is just extending t=
hat preference to particular categories such as C and G.

Steve Vickers.
