** ONLINE WORLDWIDE SEMINAR ON LOGIC AND SEMANTICS (OWLS) **
** https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vicaryjo/owls/ **

The Online Worldwide Seminar on Logic and Semantics is a new
online-only series of fortnightly research talks, highlighting the
most exciting recent work in the international computer science logic
community. In this time of restricted international travel, a key aim
of this series is to provide a forum for informal discussion and
social interaction that is so important for the progress of science.
To facilitate this, the seminar incorporates in virtual form a number
of features more normally associated with physical meetings, including
virtual "coffee breaks" before and after the seminar, allowing
participants to chat in small groups. (Don't forget to bring your own
coffee.)

We are delighted to announce our initial programme of talks, all of
which take place on Wednesdays at 14:00 UTC+1. All members of the
computer science logic community are welcome, from students to
professors.

  - April 1. Kevin Buzzard, Imperial College London. "Is HoTT the way
to do mathematics?"
  - April 15. Joost-Pieter Katoen, Aachen University. "Termination of
probabilistic programs"
  - April 29. Daniela Petrisan, University of Paris. "Combining
probabilistic and non-deterministic choice via weak distributive laws"
  - May 13. Bartek Klin, Warsaw University: "Monadic monadic second order logic"
  - May 27. Dexter Kozen, Cornell University: "Brzozowski derivatives
as distributive laws"

Talks are fully interactive, with audience members able to see the
speaker's face at the same time as the slides, and able to ask
questions with full audio and video, just as they would in a physical
seminar, allowing the nuanced communication that is so critical for
modern science.

The seminar series is based on the Zoom technology platform, which is
capable of handing large meetings with ease. Visit the OWLS webpage
given at the top of this email for more information about the seminar,
and to sign up for our reminder email list.

Best wishes, the organizers:

   - Alexandra Silva, University College London
   - Pawel Sobocinski, Tallinn University of Technology
   - Jamie Vicary, University of Birmingham
