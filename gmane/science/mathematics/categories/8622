From the NYT ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/science/john-nash-a-beauti=
ful-mind-subject-and-nobel-winner-dies-at-86.html ):

> John Forbes Nash, Jr., ... born on June 13, 1928, ... was
> killed, along with his wife, in a car crash on Saturday in ...
> a taxi on the New Jersey Turnpike in Monroe Township ...=20
> driver lost control ... hit a guardrail and another car ... .

He had

> ...  shared a Nobel Prize in 1994 ... [and was now] returning home

A few more weeks and he'd have reached the age of 87. RiP.
