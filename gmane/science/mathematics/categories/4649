                                PhD Position
                                         in
Operational and Categorical Approaches to Parametricity

       Department of Computer and Information Sciences
             University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland


Applications are invited for one PhD position within the newly-formed
Mathematically Structured Programming group at the University of
Strathclyde. The group comprises Prof. Neil Ghani, Dr. Patricia Johann,
and Dr. Conor McBride. The funded PhD project centers around operational
and categorical approaches to relational parametricity, which serves as
the basis for deriving both structured tools for programming with, and
effective techniques for reasoning about, functional programs, solely fro=
m
their (polymorphic) types. The project aims to develop the theoretical
foundations of parametricity for languages supporting advanced datatypes
--- such as nested types, GADTs, and their mixed-variance versions --- as
well as to apply these foundations to program transformations and other
applications. The project is under the direction of Patricia Johann.

The successful applicant will have a first-class BSc or an MSc with
distinction in Mathematics or Computing Science or a related
subject with a strong Mathematics or Computing Science component.
Ideally, they will also have a strong, documented interest in doing
research. Strong mathematical background and problem-solving
skills are essential; good programming skills are a plus. Prior
knowledge in the areas of operational semantics, category theory,
and/or parametricity is an advantage, but is not required.

The PhD position is for 3 years; the start date is negotiable. The
position is a fully-funded post for a home (i.e., UK) or EU student, and
includes both coverage of fees and an EPSRC-level stipend for each of the
three years.

More information about the department is available at

The University of Strathclyde (http://www.strath.ac.uk) is located in the
heart of Glasgow, which Lonely Planet Travel Guides hail as "one of
Britain's largest, liveliest and most interesting cities" (see
http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/scotland/glasgow/). Southern
Scotland provides a particularly stimulating environment for researchers
in theoretical computer science, with active groups in this area at
Heriot-Watt University, the University of Edinburgh, the University of
Glasgow, the University of St. Andrews, and the University of Strathclyde=
.

Requests for further information and other informal enquiries can be sent
to:

        Patricia Johann
        patricia@cis.strath.ac.uk

Students interested in joining the group to work on other topics should
contact Prof. Ghani at Neil.Ghani at ng@cis.strath.ac.uk, since further
positions are expected soon.

Those interested in the position are asked to send e-mail to the address
given above. Full Details of the application process are available upon
request, but an application will include:

 1. A cover letter stating the applicant's specific interest in the
      project.

  2. A full curriculum vitae, including an abstract of the applicant's
       graduate thesis and the name of their supervisor.

  3. Letters of recommendation or references from at least two
       scientific staff members. (Letters of recommendation should either
       be included along with the application, or should arrive
       separately promptly.)

   4. A completed application for postgraduate study at the University
       of Strathclyde.

Applications, forms for letters of recommendation, and instructions are
available at

        http://www.strath.ac.uk/prospectus/postgraduateapplications/

Applications will be considered until the position is filled, but those
received earlier rather than later will have priority.
