ANNOUNCEMENT AND FINAL CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS (DEADLINE 4 MARCH)

25th International Conference on Types for Proofs and Programs, TYPES 2019

and

EUTYPES Cost Action CA15123 meeting

Oslo, Norway, 11 - 14 June 2019

https://cas.oslo.no/types2019/

TYPES 2019 will be held in parallel (and jointly on 12 June) with

HoTT-UF, 12-14 June 2019, https://cas.oslo.no/hott-uf/


BACKGROUND

The TYPES meetings are a forum to present new and on-going work in all
aspects of type theory and its applications, especially in formalised
and computer assisted reasoning and computer programming.

The TYPES areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

    * foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics;
    * applications of type theory;
    * dependently typed programming;
    * industrial uses of type theory technology;
    * meta-theoretic studies of type systems;
    * proof assistants and proof technology;
    * automation in computer-assisted reasoning;
    * links between type theory and functional programming;
    * formalizing mathematics using type theory.

We encourage talks proposing new ways of applying type theory. In the
spirit of workshops, talks may be based on newly published papers,
work submitted for publication, but also work in progress.

The EUTypes Cost Action CA15123 (eutypes.cs.ru.nl) focuses on the same
research topics as TYPES and partially sponsors the TYPES Conference:
Part of the programme is organised under the auspices of EUTypes.


INVITED SPEAKERS


    * Adam Chlipala (MIT, Cambridge MA, USA)
    * Assia Mahboubi, (INRIA, Nantes, France)
    * Conor McBride (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK)
    * Stephanie Weirich (University of Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, USA)



CONTRIBUTED TALKS

We solicit contributed talks: https://cas.oslo.no/types2019/submission/

Selection of those will be based on extended abstracts/short papers of 2 pp
formatted with easychair.cls. The submission site is
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtypes2019

Important dates:

    * submission of 2 pp abstract: Monday 4 March 2019, anywhere on Earth
    * notification of acceptance/rejection: 15 April 2019
    * camera-ready version of abstract: 6 May 2019

Camera-ready versions of the accepted contributions will be published
in an informal book of abstracts for distribution at the workshop.


POST-PROCEEDINGS

Similarly to TYPES 2011 and TYPES 2013-2018, a post-proceedings volume will=
  be
published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in
Informatics (LIPIcs) series. Submission to that volume will be open to =20
everyone.
Tentative submission deadline for the post-proceedings: September 2019.

ABOUT TYPES

The TYPES meetings from 1990 to 2008 were annual workshops of a
sequence of five EU funded networking projects. From 2009 to 2015,
TYPES has been run as an independent conference series. From 2016,
TYPES is partially supported by COST Action EUTypes CA15123. Previous
TYPES meetings were held in Antibes (1990), Edinburgh (1991), B=E5stad
(1992), Nijmegen (1993), B=E5stad (1994), Torino (1995), Aussois (1996),
Kloster Irsee (1998), L=F6keberg (1999), Durham (2000), Berg en Dal near
Nijmegen (2002), Torino (2003), Jouy-en-Josas near Paris (2004),
Nottingham (2006), Cividale del Friuli (2007), Torino (2008), Aussois
(2009), Warsaw (2010), Bergen (2011), Toulouse (2013), Paris (2014),
Tallinn (2015), Novi Sad (2016), Budapest (2017), Braga (2018).
