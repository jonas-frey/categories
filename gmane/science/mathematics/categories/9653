Peter is right that Q as a field contains order information absent from Q
as either a linear or affine space.  (=E2=88=92*x*=C2=B2 =E2=89=A4 0 =E2=89=
=A4 *x*=C2=B2.)

> For the order to be definable from the algebraic structure, you need to
consider Q as a field

It certainly suffices, and indeed is traditional.

But is it necessary for the construction of the affine real line?  In
particular do we have to define multiplication on the rationals only to
throw it away at a later stage?

Obviously the ordered dyadic rationals would suffice.  Equally obviously
they don't form a field.

But can they be defined as an ordered affine space with the same degree of
formality and economy as we routinely define the ordered linear space of
rationals?

Claim.  The ordered algebra (D, xy, x+y, =E2=89=A4) consisting of the set D=
  of
dyadic rationals under the two binary operations xy denoting 2y - x and x+y
denoting (x + y)/2 can be defined order-algebraically up to isomorphism as
the free ordered algebra on the ordinal 2 satisfying finitely many
equations in the two operations along with the inference rules, from x =E2=
=89=A4 y
infer each of

y =E2=89=A4 xy
yx =E2=89=A4 x
x =E2=89=A4 x+y
x+y =E2=89=A4 y

The Dedekind cuts being cuts in the rational line, the following claim
depends on a distinct name for the corresponding notion of a cut in the
ordered affine line of dyadic rationals, which I suggest calling a dyadic
cut.  (When cutting at a dyadic rational follow a consistent convention as
to which side to associate that rational, as done with the Dedekind cuts,
and always have both sides of the cut nonempty.)

Claim.  The dyadic cuts in the ordered affine space of dyadic rationals are
in order-preserving bijection with the Dedekind cugts in the ordered linear
space of rationals, with the cuts at dyadic rationals correctly matched to
their Dedekind counterparts.
