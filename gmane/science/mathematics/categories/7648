                   CALL FOR PAPERS:  CALCO Tools 2013

                       --> DEADLINE EXTENSION

  5th International Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science,
                           Tools Workshop

                         September 3 - 6, 2013

                            Warsaw, Poland

              http://coalg.org/calco13/workshops.html#tools

=========================================================================

  	      Paper submission (extended):  April 15, 2013
               Author notification:          May 13, 2013
               Final version due:            June 3, 2013

=========================================================================

-- SCOPE --

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with
interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging
uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science. It is a high-level,
bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of
CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer
Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development
Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Swansea (Wales,
2005), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Udine (Italy, 2009) and Winchester (UK,
2011). The fifth edition will be held in Warsaw, the capital of
Poland.

As part of CALCO, a workshop dedicated to tools based on algebraic
and/or coalgebraic principles, CALCO Tools, will be held alongside the
main conference. Papers of this workshop will be
included in the CALCO proceedings.

CALCO-Tools will take place on the same dates as the main CALCO
conference, with no overlap between the technical programmes of the
two events. Topics of interest include systems, prototypes, and tools
developed specifically for the design, checking, execution, and
verification of (co)algebraic specifications, but also tools targeting
different application domains while making core or interesting use of
(co)algebraic techniques.

Tool submissions should not exceed 5 pages in LNCS format. The
accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of the
conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the time
of submission. Each submission will be evaluated by at least three
reviewers; one or more of the reviewers will be asked to download and
use the tool. At least one of the authors of each tool paper must
attend the conference to demo the tool. To submit a paper please visit
our easychair submission site at

-- LOCATION --

Warsaw, the capital of Poland, is a lively city with many historic
monuments and sights, but also with a thriving business district. It
is easily accessible via two airports: the main Chopin Airport, used by
most international carriers, and the recently open Warsaw Modlin
Airport (30 minutes away by rail), used by budget airlines.
