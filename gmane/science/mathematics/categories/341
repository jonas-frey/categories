Here is a short paper summarizing some work done by my student
Laurel Langford.

2-Tangles
John C. Baez and Laurel Langford

Just as links may be algebraically described as certain morphisms in
the category of tangles, compact surfaces smoothly embedded in R^4
may be described as certain 2-morphisms in the 2-category of
`2-tangles in 4 dimensions'.  In this announcement we give a purely
algebraic characterization of the 2-category of unframed unoriented
2-tangles in 4 dimensions as the `free semistrict braided monoidal
2-category with duals on one unframed self-dual object'.  A
forthcoming paper will contain a proof of this result using the movie
moves of Carter, Rieger and Saito.  We comment on how one might use
this result to construct invariants of 2-tangles.
