Dear List,

The weakest form of limits in a bicategory are defined by equivalences of
hom-categories in place of the slightly more strict version defined by
isomorphisms.  Then the process of defining a monoidal structure on a
bicategory with finite products takes on a slightly different flavor in each
case.

In the weak case, given a pair of 1-cells one must *choose* a monoidal
product, whereas in the latter case, a *unique choice* of monoidal product
can be obtained from the one-dimensional aspect of the universal property.

I would guess that in the former case, one should not worry too much about
how to choose the product 1-cells, since the universal property will come to
the rescue when checking that one has indeed defined a monoidal structure on
the bicategory.

Does anyone know of a reference which proves something along these lines?

Best,
Alex
