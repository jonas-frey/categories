        There is certainly a similarity. Tau categories are cartesian
categories (categories with all finite limits) which not only have selected
monics but also selected jointly-monic n-tuples for all finite n; and all
these things compose. Freyd shows every cartesian category is equivalent to
a tau category.

        My construction seems very like Peter's but shortened by working
only on monics and not jointly monic lists, and never using limits.
