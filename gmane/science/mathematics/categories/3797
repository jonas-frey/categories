           UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD
         COMPUTING LABORATORY
        Programming Tools Group
Oxford University Computing Laboratory has a fully
funded three year research studentship working in
the Programming Tools Group with the abc team:

PROJECT SUMMARY

Software systems are rarely written from scratch: they
evolve over long periods of time. When a change is
made, this often affects many different locations in a
system, and it is hard to make a change consistently.
For that reason, automated tools to help the process of
software change are desirable. "Refactoring" refers to
the process of restructuring an existing piece of
software, often prior to introducing new functionality, or to
take advantage of a new technology. Refactoring must
preserve the behaviour of existing code, and tools that
help in refactoring both assist in the restructuring
process and in checking that the behaviour has not
changed.

Unfortunately today's refactoring tools are very hard
to construct, they are still quite limited in functionality,
and they often contain bugs. This project aims to construct
a framework for better refactoring tools. In particular,
the work is driven by refactorings for a new set of
language features, called `aspect-oriented programming'
that have recently been added to Java.

Our framework will be based on developments in three
separate areas of computer science:
* "strategies" to control the process of rewriting program
  code, from the term rewriting community
* "reference attribute grammars" to specify the
  conditions that guarantee behaviour is preserved, from
  the compilers community
* "incremental evaluation" of declarative rules, from
  the functional and logic programming community.

The quality of our framework will be assessed by coding
selected case studies using alternative methods. In
particular, we shall implement several refactorings directly
in Eclipse, the leading development environment
for writing aspect-oriented programs in industry.

SELECTION CRITERIA

The PhD student will be concerned with the theoretical
foundations of the refactoring framework, for instance proofs
of correctness for refactorings, and also for the incremental
evaluation mechanism. We are thus looking for someone with
good mathematical skills, in particular regarding formal
properties of type systems and program analyses. Candidates
must have an outstanding undergraduate or master's degree in
computer science. More generally, candidates must satisfy
the usual requirements:

for doing a doctorate at Oxford.

HOW TO APPLY

The deadline for applications has been extended to July 17,
2007, but earlier applications will be reviewed immediately,
so candidates are encouraged to apply as soon as possible.
Previous applicants need not re-apply. To apply
you need to download the University's application form from:
