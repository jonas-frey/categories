[Apologies for multiple copies - please forward to interested candidates]

Applications are invited for a Research Associate to work on the FP6-IST
project  SENSORIA. The overall aim of the project is to develop a
comprehensive approach to the engineering of software systems for the
emerging Service-Oriented Computing paradigm, integrating foundational
theories, techniques, and methods, as well as a pragmatic software
engineering approach.

The post is available within WP7 to support the development and
verification of service-oriented systems by means of automated,
verifiable transformations. Applicants should have completed or be
nearing completion of a PhD in Computer Science or a related subject,
and be in possession of a good background in graph transformations,
their verification and implementation, and their application to model
transformations. Some knowledge of logic and algebraic specification
techniques is desirable.

The post is for one year, but likely to be extended by a further six
months. Closing Date for applications is 8 February 2008.

Please find further details at

I'm happy to answer any further questions.
