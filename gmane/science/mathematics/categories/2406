Ramifications of Category Theory

A Workshop
including a featured lecture series by F. W. Lawvere


A Workshop on the Ramifications of Category Theory will take place in
Florence, Italy, from November 18 to November 22, 2003.


The workshop will pay attention not only to issues internal to category
theory, and in particular to topos theory, but also to manifold
relationships of category theory with topology, logic, philosophy, physics
and theoretical computer science, as witnessed by the list of invited
speakers. The aim is that of providing a recognition of present-day
frontiers of category-theoretic research and a perspective on future
research in the field, with emphasis on the foundations of mathematics and
the applications of category theory.



The workshop is also intended to honor Professor F.W. Lawvere on the 40th
anniversary of his Doctoral thesis on Functorial Semantics for Algebraic
Theories and to help bring into clearer focus the philosophical consequences
of his work, in particular the deep unification of geometry, algebra and
logic and of the concepts and tools of these areas of mathematics which have
stemmed from it.



Professor Lawvere will give a series of lectures, one central topic of which
will be quality, in its relation to space and quantity. Intensive and
extensive aspects of quality, together with an adjoint characterization of
it will be examined.

The general goal of his lectures will be to concentrate some
essentials from research in algebra and geometry to arrive at precise
philosophical formulations as a guide to the pursuit of learning and
future research in mathematical sciences.
