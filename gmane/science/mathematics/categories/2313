At least in the book "Elemente der Kategorientheorie" by D. Pumpl\"un
the above characterization of natural maps is used explicitely; there is
also a short discussion on obtaining simpler proofs this way.

For the above reason \circ is used for the "horizontal composition";
\cdot or \ast (I do not remember which one) is used for the
"vertical composition", which after all looks more "point-wise".

Unfortunately some authors use these symbols just the other way round.
