E. Carletti - M. Grandis
Fundamental groupoids as generalised pushouts of codiscrete groupoids
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 603 (2013).

Abstract. Every differentiable manifold X has a =91good cover=92, where =20=

all open sets and their finite intersections are contractible. Using =20
a generalised van Kampen theorem for open covers we deduce that the =20
fundamental groupoid of X is a =91generalised pushout=92 of codiscrete =20=

groupoids and inclusions.
This fact motivates the present brief study of generalised pushouts. =20
In particular, we show that every groupoid is up to equivalence a =20
generalised pushout of codiscrete subgroupoids, and that (in any =20
category) finite generalised pushouts amount to ordinary pushouts and =20=

coequalisers.
-------

Before submitting it, I would like to know if the =91generalised =20
pushouts=92 we are using (or similar colimits) have been considered =20
elsewhere.
(They are not simply connected colimits, in the sense of Bob Pare, =20
and indeed they cannot be constructed with pushouts.)

With best regards to all colleagues and friends. In particular to =20
Ronnie Brown and Bob Pare, whose results are used in this preprint.
