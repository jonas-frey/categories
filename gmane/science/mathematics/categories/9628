** Accessible categories and their connections - set theory - model theory
- homotopy theory -
** July 17th-20th, 2018
** University of Leeds, UK

Accessible categories are notable for their importance in other areas of
mathematics, be it through combinatorial model categories in homotopy
theory or abstract elementary classes in model theory, with large cardinal
axioms from set theory often thrown into the mix.  The goal of this
workshop is to bring together practitioners from these different fields to
try to break down barriers and build new connections.

There is no registration fee, but those wishing to attend should email
a.d.brooke-taylor@leeds.ac.uk with "Accessible categories registration" in
the subject line and their name and affiliation in the message body to
register.  Those wishing to offer a contributed talk should send their
title and abstract by June 11th.
