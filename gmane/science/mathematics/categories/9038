/A minor comment: //=0A=
//The correct plural form of "topos" is "topoi", as the plural form of =0A=
"logos" is "logoi". I vaguely remember that the plural form of "topos" =0A=
was already discussed on this board. //=0A=
/ /=0A=
//In ancient Greek, "(ho) topos" is a noun. Here is a citation: "Ton de =0A=
hyperouranion topon ..." //=0A=
//(Plato, Phaidros, Bibliotheca Oxoniensis, Tomus II, 247 c). This =0A=
citation shows that "topos" is a noun. /=0A=
=0A=
If we were doing category theory in Classical Greek, this argument would =
=0A=
be irrefutable. The claim that it's a noun is, of course, irrefutable =0A=
anyhow.=0A=
=0A=
Embedded in an English sentence, however, "topos" is, a loan word, and =0A=
the pluralization of loan words is inconsistent.  (We also don't decline =

I would like to add that the correct plural of "color" is "colores".=0A=
Because as everybody knows, "color" is a Latin noun. For example, here=0A=
is a citation: "Omnes vero se Britanni vitro inficiunt, quod caeruleum=0A=
efficit colorem, atque hoc horridiores sunt in pugna aspectu" (Caesar,=0A=
Commentarii de bello Gallico, Liber V.14.2)". Proving that "color" is=0A=
a noun. Therefore, I urge everyone to use "colores" instead of the=0A=
incorrect "colors" (or worse, "colours")! -- Peter=0A=

The mathematical word "topos" is not taken from Greek, but from French as a=
=0A=
back formation of "topologie."  The French plural is "topos," and the=0A=
English analogue is "toposes."  Etymology is always interesting.=0A=

That is, of course, one view on the matter.  I'd always inclined to the Gre=
=3D=0A=
ek plural, but Peter Johnstone famously asked whether those of us who take =

that view when going out on rambles carry our supplies of hot tea in thermo=
=3D=0A=
i, and I think I have acquiesced to his point of view.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
Maintenance of the root-language plural in English in preference to simply =
=3D=0A=
adding -s or -es (as appropriate) is much stronger for words from Latin tha=
=3D=0A=
n from Greek, so the appeal to the fact that the Latinate plurals of axis, =
=3D=0A=
simplex, (but not complex), and locus are maintained isn't that strong an a=

rgument. Using the Greek plural also opens up the question of whether it sh=

=0A=
Yes, this what ancient Greek would dictate.=0A=
=0A=
However, people have argued convincingly that "toposes" is in fact the form=
  intended by Grothendieck.=0A=
=0A=
See, for example, footnote 4 in McLarty's =E2=80=9CThe Uses and Abuses of t=
he History of Topos Theory=E2=80=9D.=0A=
=0A=
Moreover, the plural form "topoi" is used for too many notions in the human=
ities (including journal titles). Just try =0A=
googling for it. And then google for "toposes", for comparison.=0A=
=0A=
To me, "topoi" is the plural form for the notion from rhetoric and "Literat=
