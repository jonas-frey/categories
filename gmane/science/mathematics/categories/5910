I'm not against coverings of groupoids: I reworked that theory from scratch
when writing ``A concise course in algebraic topology''.  Chapter 3
(pp21-32)
does covering spaces, covering groupoids, the orbit category and the various
equivalences of categories among them. I like it, but that chapter is
maybe the
main reason that my book is less popular than others: non-categorical
types find
it too difficult for young minds to absorb the first time around.
