Dear All,

I have decided to make available from my website a scanned copy of =
Cole's
preprint that Peter Johnstone had given me. It can be found at the =
address
http://www.oliviacaramello.com/Unification/ColeBicategoryTopoiSpectra.pdf=
  .
There is also a link to the paper at the bottom of the following page:
http://www.oliviacaramello.com/Unification/Resources.html .

It is a marvelous piece of work which deserves to be widely read.

I hope that the author will not mind his old preprint being put on the
internet. I would be grateful to anyone who can provide me with his =
contact
details, which I have not managed to find, so that I can make sure that =
he
is fine with this.

Best regards,
Olivia=20
