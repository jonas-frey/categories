Dear Andrei,

Sketches are not mathematical objects in their own right, in the same sense
that groups or spaces are. They are presentations (for theories), and have
status similar to other sorts of presentations (for groups, rings, etc.)

Of course that is in no way meant to suggest that they are not important and
worthy of study.

Regards,

Steve Lack.
