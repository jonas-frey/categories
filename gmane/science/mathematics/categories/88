Dear category theorists,
I have a question concerning enriched left Kan-extensions.

My situation is the following:
V is a complete and cocomplete symmetric monoidal closed category, A and B
two small V categories and F:A-->B a V-functor. Via the V-left-Kan extension
one gets a V-adjunction
Lan_F: V-Fun(A,V)<-->V-Fun(B,V):F*
where F* denotes the precomposition with F.

Moreover, the V-category V-Fun(A,V) and the V-category V-Fun(B,V) are
equipped with a symmetric V-monoidal structure respectively. Is it known,
under which conditions the adjunction (Lan_F,F*) is actually a monoidal
adjunction? Surely, it must have something to do with F: I suppose that F
have to be a symmetric monoidal functor with respect to a symmetric
V-monoidal structure on and A and B. The V-monoidal structures on A and B
also should have something to do with the V-monoidal structure on V-Fun(A,V)
and V-Fun(B,V).

Does anyone know a reference for this situation?

Thank you in advance for any help.
Tony
