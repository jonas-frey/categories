What does "when it was crushed" mean?  Assuming an infinitely small fly,
i.e. a point, and modeling locomotives as line segments (since they're
much bigger than flies), if the locomotives are open at the front (the
better to absorb the shock of hitting a cow) then "when it was crushed"
cannot be when the frontiers of the locomotives met since there was room
for the fly then.  But at every other candidate for "when it was
crushed" we can ask in which direction it was flying.

The argument looks fine with at least one locomotive closed (cows be
damned).  With exactly one the fly is crushed before the locomotives
collide, while if both are closed the fly is crushed when they collide.
  In either case you're right.

Vaughan
