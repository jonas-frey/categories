The recent postings of Jean Benabou have, it seems to me,
had at least two effects:

1. promoting a better understanding of
the historical truth
of how, in what order, and by whom various categorical ideas
were discovered and disseminated, and

2. in confronting possible inaccuracies
in some other mathematicians understanding of the same,
making some of those other mathematicians, and no doubt some bystanders,
uncomfortable (to say the least)
at the inflammatory tone of some of M. Benabou's remarks.

I think the first effect is salutary and beneficial to the understanding of
the past,
and thus also, to the future.
It would be unfortunate and, I believe, harmful,
to prevent M. Benabou from assisting the mathematical community
in obtaining better understanding of the categorical past.

On the other hand,
at least one thing should not have been said on this mailing list,
or elsewhere:
"I advise [Peter Johnstone] to lose very quickly such habits,
they might become dangerous for one's health."
(Benabou's message of November 3).
Threats, explicit or implict, to the reputation of individuals are
permissible
(one's reputation is a function of the collective body),
while threats to one's "health" are not.

As a proposal, and request to the moderator to modify
his "48 hour" limit imposed in his addition to Dusko Pavlovic's message of
November 9,
I suggest the following rule:

The discussion and argument may continue
to the point of diminishing returns (repetition and triviality).
Threats of illegal action (such as the one quoted above) will not be
allowed.
A positive and respectful tone,
accepting the good faith and intentions of all parties,
is required.

Again, the intent is to keep the good (increased understanding),
while avoiding the bad (unnecessary insults and threats).

By the way, I am, shall we say,
an interested bystander to the discussions on this list.
The fact that my contributions to category theory are nil
may, on the one hand,
mean that I do not have the right to intrude in this matter,
or on the other hand,
may mean that I can be more objective,
without axes to grind or anything to defend or assert.
You choose which to believe.

In any case, thanks to all parties,
Rosebrugh, Benabou, Johnstone and all the others
for your vast and much appreciated contributions
both to mathematical research and to this list.

Sincerely,
Keith Harbaugh
