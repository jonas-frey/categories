               MATHFIT SUMMERSCHOOL IN EDINBURGH

                    GAMES AND COMPUTATION
       Laboratory for the Foundations of Computer Science
                      JUNE 23-24 1997

The use of games to model various aspects of computation has been notably
successful over the past few years. In particular, two areas where there
has been rapid progress recently are: game semantics and its applications
to programming languages and logic; and the use of games in verifying
properties of concurrent processes.

Game semantics has been used to give the first syntax-independent
constructions of fully abstract models for functional languages such as
PCF and FPC (Abramsky,Jagadeesan and Malacaria, Hyland and Ong, Nickau,
McCusker), for
imperative languages such as Idealized Algol (Abramsky and McCusker), and
for languages with non-local control operators such as call-cc (Ong,
Laird). There are promising applications to object-oriented languages in
progress.

In the area of concurrency, games have been used to explicate
bisimulation and proof-search in the modal mu-calculus (Stirling). This has
been applied to the Edinburgh Concurrency Workbench by Perdita Stevens, and
has resulted in improvements to the efficiency of the implementation.
