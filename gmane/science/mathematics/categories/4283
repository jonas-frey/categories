This is so fundamental that I'm inclined to make it an axiom.
(Well, we can leave uniquiness --up to isomorphism, you mean--
and the invertibility of the structure map for theorems.)
This is essentially an axiom of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions,
which (like most modern type theory) is easily put in categorial language.

All the same, I find these matters much easier to understand
when I think about them in terms of categories of sets,
rather than in terms of (models of a) membership-based set theory.
I would be able to read FoM if it weren't so hostile to this
(although I'll follow Vaughn in noting that I haven't looked lately,
so I can't speak for what it's like now).

No, but one can ask of a topos with a natural-numbers object N
(and satisfying other properties that match various axioms of ZF),
given a morphism X -> N whose pullbacks 0, 1, 2, ...: 1 -> N
are all occupied (so each pullback has a morphism from 1),
whether the negation of X over N (the internal hom [0, X]
taken in the slice category over N) can also be occupied.
