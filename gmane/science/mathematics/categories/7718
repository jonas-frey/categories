Hi,

I received the following question from a grad student that I was unable to
answer, but maybe you can (shared with permission). The subcategory Comp_M
he introduces below can equally be defined to be the inverter of the
counit of the monadic adjunction. But I don't see how this universal
property helps understand limits in the subcategory. We suspect a left
adjoint to the inclusion is unlikely.

Can you help? Or have you seen something like this before?

Best,
Emily

Hi folks,
??
I'm interested in closure properties of a particular subcategory of the
category of algebras of a monad. To be more precise, let C be a locally
presentable category and M be a monad on C. The category of algebras Alg_M
has all limits, and they are computed in C. Denote by Comp_M the full
subcategory of Alg_M of "M-complete objects" (does anyone have a better
name?), with objects those X in C such that the unit X -> MX is an
isomorphism, viewed in the natural way as M-algebras (using the inverse MX
-> X).
??
My question: Is Comp_M closed under (actually: sequential) limits, computed
as limits in Alg_M?
??
For some examples that come to mind immediately, the answer is clearly yes,
because Comp_M is either trivial (e.g., if M is the free monoid monad on
Sets) or all of Alg_M (i.e., if M is idempotent). A more interesting example
is Bousfield-Kan R-completion, for which I don't know the answer.
??
In fact, I'm interested in left exact monads; in this case, the idempotent
approximation is given by the equalizer of the two natural maps M -> M^2,
but I'm not sure if this is relevant. What I'm hoping for is a sufficient
criterion or a good counterexample in the abstract situation.
??
Many thanks!
