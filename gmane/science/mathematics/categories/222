Dear all=2CSomething to corroborate MacLane's abhorrence of the word "tripl=
e" is=2C in my view=2C his refusal to communicate my first paper (Marta Bun=
ge=2C Relative Functor Categories and Categories of Algebras=2C J.of Algebr=
a 11 (1969) 64-101) unless I changed the word "triple" in it for that of "m=
onad". In order to show my independence (!)=2C yet wishing to have the pape=
r published=2C I changed "triple" back to "standard construction". This he =
accepted without objections. Nowadays I use monads like everybody else. I h=
ave no idea which=2C among the many possible reasons suggested in categorie=
s=2C was MacLane's reason for insisting on "monads"=2C whether philosophica=
l or mathematical. However=2C his acceptance of my use of "standard constru=
ction" suggests that his dislike of "triple" was stronger than his preferen=
ce for "monad". Cordial regards=2CMarta Bunge
