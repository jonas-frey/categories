General Information
-------------------

* 8th International Workshop on Bidirectional Transformations

* http://bx-community.wikidot.com/bx2019:home <http://bx-community.wikidot.=
com/bx2019:home>

* June 4, 2019, Saint Joseph=E2=80=99s University, Philadelphia, PA, USA

* as part of the Philadelphia Logic Week (PLW) 2019: https://sites.sju.edu/=
plw/ <https://sites.sju.edu/plw/>

Bidirectional transformations (bx) are a mechanism for maintaining the cons=
istency of at least two related sources of information. Such sources can be=
  relational databases, software models and code, or any other document foll=
owing standard or ad hoc formats. Bx are an emerging topic in a wide range =
of research areas, with prominent presence at top conferences in several di=
fferent fields (namely databases, programming languages, software engineeri=
ng, and graph transformation), but with results in one field often getting =
limited exposure in the others. Bx 2019 is a dedicated venue for bx in all =
relevant fields, and is part of a workshop series that was created in order=
  to promote cross-disciplinary research and awareness in the area. As such,=
  since its beginning in 2012, the workshop has rotated between venues in di=
fferent fields.

Bx 2019 will be a part of Philadelphia Logic Week (PLW) 2019, which also in=
cludes conference and workshops on logic, provenance, and databases, topics=
  that we hope will complement Bx and help build engagement with these commu=
nities.
