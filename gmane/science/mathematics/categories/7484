A preprint of my paper "A general Fubini theorem for the Riesz
paradigm" is available at

This paper includes results presented at the Workshop on
Category Theory, Coimbra, July 2012.  An abstract is included
below.  Your comments are welcome.

Other papers of mine are available through my website, including
"Algebraic theory of vector-valued integration" (published in
Advances in Mathematics, June 2012) and "Totally distributive
toposes" (published in Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra,
November 2012 issue).

Abstract:  We prove an abstract Fubini-type theorem in the
context of monoidal and enriched category theory, and as a
corollary we establish a Fubini theorem for integrals on
arbitrary convergence spaces that generalizes (and entails) the
classical Fubini theorem for Radon measures on compact Hausdorff
spaces.  Given a symmetric monoidal closed adjunction satisfying
certain hypotheses, we show that an associated monad of natural
distributions D is commutative.  Applying this result to the
monoidal adjunction between convergence spaces and convergence
vector spaces, the commutativity of D amounts to a Fubini
theorem for continuous linear functionals on the space of scalar
functions on an arbitrary convergence space.
