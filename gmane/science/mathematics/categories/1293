Workshop on 

Algebraic K-theory, algebraic homotopy, and global actions

Mathematics Division,
School of Informatics, 
University of Wales, Bangor

January 4-12, 2000

This workshop is the next in a series of Bangor/Bielefeld workshops which
have formed part of a British Council/ARC programme in collaboration with
Prof A Bak (Bielefeld). Colleagues outside Bangor/Bielefeld are welcome to
participate at their own costs. 

The matters for lectures and discussion will include the following
and their interactions

(i)   Global actions and groupoid atlases
(ii)  Homotopy limits and colimits
(iii) Generalised dimension theory for categories
(iv)  Related topics


                                 Participants (as of December 3)

Background

Bak's theory of Global Actions gives a framework for an algebraic approach
to higher Algebraic K-theory, and in fact has more general applications.
This framework has been generalised in joint work with Bangor to the
notion of Groupoid Atlas. There have emerged from previous workshops links
between single domain global actions and recent work in Geometric Group
Theory, including complexes of groups, higher generation by subgroups, and
identities among relations for presentations.
