6WFTop Announcement

The 6th Workshop on Formal Topology (6WFTop) will be hosted by the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, UK, in the week Mon 8 to Fri 12 April 2019.

These workshops  date back to 1997, and cover point-free topology, broadly interpreted, and its logical foundations. There is always a lively and fruitful interaction between different communities and the meetings have proved fertile ground for developing commonalities between different foundational approaches such as predicative type theory, toposes and constructive set theory.

6WFTop will include a tutorial day on the Monday around the theme "What is a space?", in which Matthieu Anel and Benedikt Ahrens will introduce the ideas of toposes and univalent type theory.

In addition, a number of other researchers have accepted an invitation to give a talk: Ingo Blechschmidt, Olivia Caramello Tatsuji Kawai, Peter Johnstone and Giovanni Sambin.

There will be an opportunity for participants to contribute talks. If you wish to do so, please submit an abstract by 28 Feb 2019.

Further details will appear on the workshop web site at
