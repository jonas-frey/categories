   E. W. BETH DISSERTATION PRIZE 2003: CALL FOR NOMINATIONS

Nominations are invited for the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize awarded
by the European Association for Logic, Language and Information to
outstanding dissertations in the fields of Logic, Language and
Information. The prize will be awarded to the best dissertation which
resulted in a PhD in the year 2002. The dissertations will be judged
on the impact they made in their respective fields, breadth and
originality of the work, and also on the interdisciplinarity of the
work. Ideally the winning dissertation will be of interest to
researchers in all three fields.

-- Who qualifies? --
Those who were awarded the PhD degree in the area of Logic, Language
and Information between the 1st of January, 2002 and the 31st of
December, 2002. There is no restriction on the nationality of the
candidate or the university where the PhD was granted. However, after
a careful consideration, FoLLI has decided to accept only
dissertations written in English.

-- How to submit? --
We only accept electronic submissions. The following documents are
required:

1. the thesis in pdf or ps format (doc/rtf not accepted).
2. a ten page abstract of the dissertation in ascii format.
3. a letter of nomination from the thesis supervisor. Self-nominations
are not possible; each nomination must be sponsored by the thesis
supervisor. The letter of nomination should concisely describe the
scope and significance of the dissertation and state when the degree
was awarded.
4. Two additional letters of support, including at least one letter
from a referee not affiliated with the academic institution that
awarded the Ph.D. degree. All documents must be submitted
electronically to beth_award@cs.nott.ac.uk . Hard copy submissions are
not possible.

If you experience any problems with the email submission or do not
receive a notification from us within two working days, please write
to beth_award@cs.nott.ac.uk or nza@cs.nott.ac.uk .

-- Important dates: --

Deadline for Submissions: 28 February 2003
Notification of Decision: 1 June 2003
The prize will be handed to the winners at the European Summer School
in Logic, Language and Information in Vienna (Austria), 18 - 29 August
2003. Prize winners will be expected to attend the ceremony; funding
to make this possible is currently being secured.
