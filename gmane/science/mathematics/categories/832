I have a real question now.  Suppose S is a simplicial complex of
dimension n with the property that every n-1 face of every n simplex is
a face of at least two n simplexes.  I want to conclude that H_n(S) is
non-zero.  Assume that the union of the n simplexes is connected (any
connected component would inherit the hypothesis).  Then it seems clear
geometrically that the union of the faces would enclose one or more
holes, but I don't see how to actually prove this.  The space would
appear to have no boundary, but it also is not a manifold since a point
in one of the faces could have a branched neighborhood.
