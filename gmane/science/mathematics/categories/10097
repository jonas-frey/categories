======================================================================
  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? CALL FOR PAPERS
  ?????????????? SEVENTH SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 7)

  ?????????????????????????? Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia
  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? 30-31 March 2020

  ?????????????????????????????? http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/syco/7/
======================================================================

The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an
interdisciplinary series of meetings aiming to support the growing
community of researchers interested in the phenomenon of
compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives, and in
particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language.
Previous SYCO events have been held at University of Birmingham,
University of Strathclyde, University of Oxford, Chapman University,
and University of Leicester.

We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science,
mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of
fostering friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading
knowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature
research and work in progress, and by both established academics and
junior researchers, including students.

While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions
with a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in
particular from the perspective of category theory:

- logical methods in computer science, including classical and
quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language
processing and machine learning;

- graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and
reaction networks;

- languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets,
type theory and game semantics;

- abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal
category theory, higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and
relationships to homotopy theory;

- quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation
theory;

- tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof
assistants, and game theory;

- industrial applications, including case studies and real-world
problem descriptions.


IMPORTANT DATES
========

All deadlines are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth.

Submission deadline:???? Monday 10 February 2020
Author notification:???? Monday 17 February 2020
Symposium dates:???????????? Monday 30 and Tuesday 31 March 2020


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
========

Submission are by EasyChair, via the SYCO 7 submission page:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=syco7

Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions.
The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even
if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. Think creatively---
you could submit a recent paper, or notes on work in progress, or even
a recent Masters or PhD thesis.

In the event that more good-quality submissions are received than can
be accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose
to *defer* some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject
them. Deferred submissions can be re-submitted to any future SYCO
meeting, where they will not need peer review, and where they will be
prioritised for inclusion in the programme. Meetings will be held
sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.

If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous SYCO
meeting, it will not automatically be considered for SYCO 7; you still
need to submit it again through EasyChair. When submitting, append the
words "DEFERRED FROM SYCO X" to the title of your paper, replacing "X"
with the appropriate meeting number. There is no need to attach any
documents.
