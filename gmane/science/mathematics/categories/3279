Thanks for replies.

I am familiar with Breen's work, and the correspondence between crossed
modules and gr-stacks. I ws thinking more along the lines of "a smooth gr-
chart K (or whatever it is called) for a differentiable gr-stack G is a
representable surjection K --> G satisfying the properties..." (with some 2-
cartesian squares following). Such a thing might be in Champs Algebriques
, in the category of schemes, but I haven't got it at the library.
