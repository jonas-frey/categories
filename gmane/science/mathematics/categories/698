Cartesion natural transformations data:F=>L into the list functor have
	been used to represent the data-shape decomposition of many
	data types of the form FX.

	    data_X
	FX --------> LX 
	|  |         |
F! = 	|  |         | L! =
shape	|--          | length
	|            |
	F1 --------> L1 
	   data_1 =
	   arity

Examples include tree types and array types. See, for example

If T(X) = mu_Y. X + P(X,Y) for some polynomial P then the
	cartesian-ness of the unit for the monad follows from one of
	the main theorems of the paper above, which shows that taking
	initial algebras preserves cartesian-ness. Here it is applied
	to the (cartesian) inclusion X -> X + P(X,Y).
