[note from moderator: resent due to faulty From: ]

I've been following the recent posts on undirected graphs
with interest. But I have a question. I think it's being said
that undirected graphs are the same as directed graphs with
involution. (Presheaves on the full subcategory of SET determined
by 1 and 2, or just 2.) Which is nice but what about loops?
The involution might fix a loop or not. So wouldn't we be
getting undirected graphs with two kinds of loops, whole loops
and semiloops? What am I missing?

Bob
