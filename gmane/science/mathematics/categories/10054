Dear all,

This is very sad news indeed.

My memory of Erik is as a quiet but thoughtful and warm person, candid
and principled, and vastly knowledgeable.

Erik was my entry-point into the world of type theory, when, in 2016, he
let me, then an impressionable masters student, into his cavernous
setoid libraries, where I spent six happy months messing with
E-categories---'"Erik"-categories'---and ECwAs, lost in the heady lure
of checking coherences in a proof assistant.

-Chaitanya.
