Nowadays when I hear "Never heard of x" my subconscious seems to turn it
into "never heard of Wikipedia."   When five people tell you x is the
answer to your question, merely filing it "for future reference" misses
the point of the answer.  (As one of the five, my examples consisted of
the finite nonempty chains and the finite Boolean algebras, which I
pointed out to Peter gave an example of every finite positive
cardinality, and two for the powers of two.  My mistake was to lump
these examples together under the common rubric of "Heyting algebra,"
which appears to have made what was meant to be a simple answer
incomprehensible.)

As Bill points out, a Heyting algebra is almost the same thing as a CCC
in the case of categories that are posets.  This is exactly the case
when there are finitely many objects (a case where Heyting algebras and
distributive lattices are "the same thing" in the sense that they have
the same underlying posets), and is close to true modulo existence of
joins in the infinite case.  In particular a Heyting algebra needs the
empty join 0 in order to define negation as x->0, whence the negative
integers made a category with its standard ordering is cartesian closed
but is not a Heyting algebra for want of a least negative integer.  More
generally Heyting algebras are required to have all finite joins, not a
requirement for posetal cartesian closed categories.
