Dear Categorists,

this is the first announcement of the workshop "Categorical Probability
and Statistics", taking place 5-8 June 2020 as part of the Canadian
Mathematical Society's 75th Anniversary Summer Meeting at the University
of Ottawa, and organized by myself and Rory Lucyshyn-Wright.

See http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/2019/cps_workshop/ for
some more information.

While categorical approaches to probability have been investigated both
by category theorists and by statisticians since the 1960s, the past few
years have seen tremendous progress, much of it driven by computer
scientists, which makes a categorical foundation for probability and
statistics seem feasible. The goal of this workshop is to bring together
these communities for an exchange of ideas, methods and goals.
Optimally, it will facilitate the emergence of a new interdisciplinary
research community focusing on categorical probability and statistics.

We have the following (tentative and yet incomplete) list of speakers:

* Franck van Breugel
* Vincent Danos
* H=C3=B4ng V=C3=A2n L=C3=AA
* Bart Jacobs
* Peter McCullagh
* Paolo Perrone
* Eigil Fjeldgren Rischel
* Alexandra Silva
* Robert W. Spekkens
* David Spivak
* Sam Staton

We also hope to arrange for plenty of informal discussions outside of
the talks.

It would be great to see many of you there. It may help to know that
another part of the Summer Meeting is Dorette Pronk's "Logic and
Category Theory", and also the 28th Foundational Methods in Computer
Science Workshop (http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~rblute/FMCS2020/) will take
place in Ottawa directly afterwards.

best regards,
Tobias
