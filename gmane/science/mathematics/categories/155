In terms of common mathematical usage, the student was wrong to say
that a constant function is a function with no input.  A constant
function can be defined on any domain; its defining characteristic is
that it has the same value for every input.

In categorical terms, a constant function is a function that factors
through the terminal object.  The empty function to an object should
be defined as the unique function from the initial object to that
object, but I am not claiming that is common usage.

Some computer languages do indeed have functions with no inputs.
Their output can still vary since the definition may contain global
variables.   No doubt objects (in the sense of OOP) with global
variables can be modeled as objects in a slice category but now I am
out of my depth, so I will stop.
