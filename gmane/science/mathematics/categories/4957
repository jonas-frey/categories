Dear categorists,

When I read the question for the first time, I did not know such a =
problem.
Moreover, my impression was that in category theory one often finds new
results, which had not been conjectured before. Sometimes an important =
part
of the work is even to develop the right notions. This may explain that
there are less important well-known problems in category theory than in
other areas.

Nevertheless, I remember a problem that can be easily formulated in pure
category and is still unsolved as far as I know. Bur it does not seem =
vastly
distributed. Cantor's diagonal says that says that the power set always =
is
of larger cardinality as the original set. Gavin Wraith suggested the
following generalization to topoi: If for two objects A,B there is a
monomorphism A^B>->B, is there also a monomorphism A>->1? This looks =
like a
meaningful analogue, and I have not seen an answer in the meantime. The
question can even be asked not only in a topos, but in every cartesian
closed category. Does anybody know anything about progress?

Greetings
Reinhard
