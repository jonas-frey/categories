                          Call for Papers
                WiL 2017: Women in Logic Workshop
                         Reykjavik, Iceland
                            June 19, 2017
     https://sites.google.com/site/firstwomeninlogicworkshop/


Affiliated with the Thirty-Second Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic
in Computer Science (LICS) 20-23 June 2017, Reykjavik, Iceland.

We are holding the first Women in Logic (WiL) workshop as a LICS
associated workshop this year. The workshop intends to follow the
pattern of meetings such as Women in Machine Learning (WiML,
http://wimlworkshop.org/) or Women in Engineering (WIE,
(http://www.ieee-ras.org/membership/women-in-engineering) that have
been taking place for quite a few years.

Women are chronically underrepresented in the LICS community;
consequently they sometimes feel both conspicuous and isolated, and
hence there is a risk that the under-representation is
self-perpetuating.

The workshop will provide an opportunity for women in the field to
increase awareness of one another and one another's work, to combat
the feeling of isolation. It will also provide an environment where
women can present to an audience comprised of mostly women,
replicating the experience that most men have at most LICS meetings,
and lowering the stress of the occasion; we hope that this will be
particularly attractive to early-career women.

Topics of interest of this workshop include but are not limited to the
usual Logic in Computer Science (LICS) topics. These are listed as
automata theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics,
concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming,
constructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures,
description logics, domain theory, finite model theory, formal aspects
of program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability,
higher-order logic, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic,
logic in artificial intelligence, logic programming, logical aspects
of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational complexity,
logical aspects of quantum computation, logical frameworks, logics of
programs, modal and temporal logics, model checking, probabilistic
systems, process calculi, programming language semantics, proof
theory, real-time systems, reasoning about security and privacy,
rewriting, type systems and type theory, and verification.

SUBMISSIONS
Contributions should be written in English and submitted in the form
of full papers (with a maximum of 10 pages) or short papers (with a
maximum of 5 pages). They must be unpublished and not submitted
simultaneously for publication elsewhere.

The papers should be prepared in latex using the LICS style (IEEE
Proceedings 2-column 10pt). LaTeX style files are available at
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/.
Please use IEEEtran.cls version V1.8b, released on 26/08/2015.

The submission should be in the form of a PDF file uploaded to the WiL
2017 Easychair page (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wil2017)
before the submission deadline of February 17th, 2017, anywhere on
Earth.

PROCEEDINGS
We plan to publish a post conference volume at ENTCS or other equally
visible outlet.
