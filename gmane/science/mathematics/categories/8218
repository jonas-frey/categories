Dear Jean,

Thank you for your detailed comments.

Something I should say straight away is that the duality argument I had in m=
ind, dualizing 2-cells, might be OK to deal with left adjoints to reindexing=
  but was completely wrong for right adjoints. Already, Richard Garner and Cl=
audio Ermida (thanks to both of them) have shown me that it doesn't do the j=
ob.

I also want to stress that at no point did I intend to set up my own definit=
ion of fibration. I was following Street's "Fibrations and Yoneda's lemma in=
  a 2-category", which defines fibrations as those 1-cells that carry pseudoa=
lgebra structure for a certain 2-monad, and then proves (Proposition 9) that=
  this is equivalent to what Street refers to as the Chevalley condition. If "=
Vickers' definition" is not equivalent to that then I have made a mistake so=
mewhere.=20

Have you found a discrepancy between the "Vickers definition" and Street? At=
  one point you write "Of course, I don't refer here to Street's notion which=
  describes a totally different kind of fibration, stable by equivalences."

I agree that the concept I have been using includes cleavage (and, for a bif=
ibration, cocleavage). I cannot assume AC in what I do, and I rather imagine=
d that structure something like the Chevalley criterion was needed in order t=
o deal with its absence. However, I admit I am not so familiar with the full=
y general notion of fibration. For me the Chevalley condition seemed enough t=
o do what I needed in the 2-category Loc of locales and my remarks were base=
d on that experience.

Best wishes,

Steve.
