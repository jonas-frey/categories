hopefully are helpful to plan your trip.

influenced by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean".
We expect sunny and warm weather during the day, but be also prepared
for cooler evenings and mornings.

The conference will start with a Welcome Reception from 6pm-8pm on
Sunday (June 14) at the terrace of the restaurant Ol?? Ria

with the location of the restaurant. In the walking map of Aveiro (see
above) you can find the restaurant at "Centro Cult. e de Congressos".

You can register at the welcome reception, and there will be buffet
style food.

The opening of the conference on Monday morning (June 15) starts at 9am
at the University of Aveiro, in Room 5.2.22 in the Education Department.
If you were not able to register on Sunday, you can do so from 8:30-9:00
in front of the lecture room. Coffee breaks are to be held at "Bar de
Matem??tica" located in the ground flour of the Mathematics Department. At

http://ct2015.web.ua.pt/schedule.html#Rooms

you will find a map of the campus with the location of the Education and
the Mathematics Department.

If you have not yet told us your preferences for the excursion or the
conference dinner, please do so as soon as possible.

Looking forward to see you in Aveiro at CT2015.
