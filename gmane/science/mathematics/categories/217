Dear All,

As usual, there have been plenty of people with comments about history.

There was also a second part to the question:

The category of functors from FinSet to Set is equivalent to the category
of endofunctors of Set which preserve filtered colimits: such endofunctors
are usually called finitary. Thus a monoid in [FinSet,Set] with respect to
this tensor product is the same thing as a monad on Set whose endofunctor
part is finitary: this is called a finitary monad.

These finitary monads on Set are equivalent to Lawvere theories and so in
turn to (finitary, single-sorted) varieties.

Finitary monads can also be considered on other base categories than Set,
especially on locally finitely presentable ones.

It is true that vector spaces are the algebras for a finitary monad on Set.
There is no need to restrict to finite-dimensional vector spaces; in fact it
is not true that there is a monad on Set whose algebras are the
finite-dimensional vector spaces.

Steve.
