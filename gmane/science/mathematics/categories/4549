Interesting speculation, but how can we verify or refute it?  What I can
add is that when I sat in on Sammy's category theory course (called
homological algebra, but I am not sure Ext or Tor were ever mentioned), I
do not recall that he so much as mentioned groupoids.  I once mentioned to
Charles Ehresmann that he appeared to view categories as a generalization
of groupoids while Eilenberg and Mac Lane thought of them as a
generalization of posets.  Charles agreed.

This reminds me of a speculation I have often had (although Saunders
denied and he knew Birkhoff pretty well).  In the 30s and 40s, the word
"homomorphism" was regularly used but always meant surjective.  By the
late 40s and 50s people were talking about "homomorphism into" meaning not
necessarily surjective.  So groups had lattices of subgroups and lattices
of quotient groups and Birkhoff invented lattice theory at least partly in
the hope that the structure of those two lattices would tell you a lot
about the structure of the group.  I don't think this actually happened to
any great extent.  But I have wondered whether Birkhoff might instead have
invented categories had our more general notion of homomorphism been
rampant.  As I said Saunders didn't think so, but it still sounds
attractive to me.

One of the things that astonishes me about "General theory of natural
equivalences" is that they clearly knew about natural transformations in
general but chose to talk only about equivalences.  I once asked Sammy
about that and he more or less said something like one generalization at a
time.  But they must have realized that the Hurevic map is a superior
example.  Still, Steenrod must have gotten the point immediately.
