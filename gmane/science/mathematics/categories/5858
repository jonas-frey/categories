[further examples cut]

In all of these examples (although obviously not all examples of isomorphisms),
this is more than just an isomorphism; it's an isomorphism over Set.
That is, it's an isomorphism in the slice category Cat/Set.
It may seem beside the point, but in fact it is also important
that it's an isomorphism in the full subcategory of Cat/Set
whose objects are only the faithful functors to Set;
call this the category Conc of CONCRETE categories.
(So they are all concrete isomorphisms of concrete categories.)

If you take a strictly speak-no-evil approach to category theory
(perhaps even going so far as to found your mathematics on FOLDS),
then it is impossible to state that two categories are isomorphic,
because you must speak of equality of objects (or functors) to do this.
In this approach, Cat and Cat/Set are bicategories but not categories.

But it IS still possible to state that two concrete categories are isomorphic;
the bicategory Conc is (up to equivalence) a locally posetal bicategory
(so if you ignore the non-invertible transformations, it's a category).
So it is possible (and necessary) to say, even when you speak no evil,
that all of Marco's examples are concrete isomorphisms.

So I agree that it is important that these are not mere equivalences,
but I claim (playing the role of an equality-is-evil partisan)
that what is important is not so much that they are isomorphisms
as that they are concrete.
