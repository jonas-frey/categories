I got a private answer that made me realize I was not clear in the way I
put my questions. I send now this mail with my answers, which I hope
will clarify the situation.

e.d.

******************

Perhaps I was not clear in my question ?

It is not belived that finite sets is a small topos with finite limits
and all the rest exept the axiom of infinity ?

Which category of finite sets ? Of course I know they are all
equivalent, but there is not a canonical small one.

The answer is not, but people behave as if it were true.

Well, there is a unique category of finite sets, but it is not small,
but people works as it it were. Take Joyal's theory of species.

Yes, what happens then when people works with a small category of finite
sets and with finite limits ?

The topos.

What if I need a small category of finite sets with finite limits. Well,
using choice I can produce one starting with the finite ordinals (or
cardinals). Choosse a limit for each finite diagram, and keep doing this
a dennumerable amount of times.

Yes, me too, so this is presisely why I ask the question.

Well, I did not explain myself clearly.

Well, it is not "brain freeze" yet ... or it is ?
