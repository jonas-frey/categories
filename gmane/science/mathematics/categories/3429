PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC

        84th meeting - second announcement

Dear Colleagues,

As most of you will already know, the 84th meeting of the seminar=3D20
takes place at the Department of Theoretical Computer Science of the
Technical University Braunschweig, Germany, over the weekend of
October 14-15, 2006.  As always, the seminar welcomes talks using or
addressing category theory or logic, either explicitly or implicitly,
in the study of any aspect of mathematics or science.

Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke have agreed to give a series of three
lectures on catgorical aspects of quantum informatics.  In addition,
we can now confirm the participation of professor Reinhard Werner,
mathematical physicist at the TU Braunschweig with special interest in
this field.

Braunschweig is located about 60 km East of Hannover and about 200 km
West of Berlin.  It can easily be reached by car or train.  The
closest airport is in Hannover; the train to Hannover's main
station takes about 20 minutes, and the train from there to
Braunschweig takes about 40 minutes.

Further information on the location of the seminar, along with details
on local travel together with an online registration form can be found
at

You will also find links to two hotels offering special university
rates, but you should register by the end of September.

Best regards,
