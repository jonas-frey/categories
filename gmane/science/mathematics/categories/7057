Dear all,

The deadline for MSFP 2012 is exactly a month away!

Since sending out the first call we have solicited invited talks from =
two very interesting speakers! See below.

Fourth Workshop on
MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
25 March, Tallinn, Estonia
A satellite workshop of ETAPS 2012

http://cs.ioc.ee/msfp/msfp2012/

The fourth workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional
Programming is devoted to the derivation of functionality from
structure. It is a celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical
Computer Science on programs as we write them today. Modern
programming languages, and in particular functional languages, support
the direct expression of mathematical structures, equipping
programmers with tools of remarkable power and abstraction. Where
would Haskell be without monads? Functional reactive programming
without arrows? Call-by-push-value without adjunctions? Type theory
without universes? The list goes on. This workshop is a forum for
researchers who seek to reflect mathematical phenomena in data and
control.

The first MSFP workshop was held in Kuressaare, Estonia, in July 2006,
affiliated with MPC 2006 and AMAST 2006. The second MSFP workshop was
held in Reykjavik, Iceland as part of ICALP 2008. The third MSFP
workshop was held in Baltimore, USA, as part of ICFP 2010.

Important Dates:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Submission of papers: 16 December 2011
Notification: 20 January 2012
Final versions due: 3 Feburary 2012
Workshop: 25 March 2012

Invited Speakers:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Submission:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted
concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. Accepted
papers must be presented at the workshop by one of the authors.

There is no specific page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.

Accepted regular papers will be published in the Electronic
Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS). After the
workshop, there might be an opportunity to publish selected papers in
a journal special issue.

All submissions must be in PDF format and use the EPTCS style
files. Submissions can be made through the EasyChair website, at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmsfp2012

ETAPS:=20
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS)
is the primary European forum for academic and industrial researchers
working on topics relating to software science. ETAPS, established in
1998, is a confederation of six main annual conferences (one of them,
POST, being new in 2012), accompanied by satellite workshops. ETAPS
2012 is the fifteenth event in the series.

Host City:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Tallinn, a city of 412,000 people, is the capital and largest city of
Estonia, a small EU member country in Northern Europe, bordering
Russia to the East and Latvia to the south. Located in the north of
the country, on the southern shores of the Gulf of Finland, opposite
Helsinki in Finland, Tallinn is most well known for its picturesque
medieval Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site. But it also has a
vivid cultural scene, outperforming most European centres of similar
size. In 2011, Tallinn, along with Turku in Finland, is the Cultural
Capital of Europe.

Tallinn is easy to travel to. Estonia is part of Schengen and the
Eurozone. The Lennart Meri International Airport of Tallinn /TLL) is
only 4km from the city centre.
