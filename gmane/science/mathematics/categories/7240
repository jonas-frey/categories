Correction:

In the last announcement for FMCS 2012, I accidentally included the
wrong email address for reserving dormitory accommodations. The
correct address is tim.ross@ukings.ca.

Please remember to book your accommodations early. Thanks, -- Peter

 	     SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT: CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

IMPORTANT DEADLINES:

*** May 1 *** - please register to speak at the workshop.
*** May 1 *** - to apply for student travel support

 				* * *

  Foundational Methods in Computer Science is an annual workshop
  bringing together researchers in mathematics and computer science
  with a focus on the application of category theory in computer
  science.

  This year's meeting will be hosted in the Department of Mathematics
  and Statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.

  There will be an informal welcoming reception in the evening of
  June 13, starting at 5:30. The scientific program starts on June 14,
  and consists of four tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to
  category theory, as well as two and a half days of research talks.
  There will be an excursion on one of the afternoons. The meeting ends
  at mid-day on June 17.

TUTORIAL LECTURES:

  There will be four tutorial lectures, presented by:

  * Robin Cockett (Calgary)
  * Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine (Dalhousie)
  * Ernie Manes (Massachusetts)
  * Simona Paoli (Leicester)

SPECIAL SESSION:

  There will be a special session in honor of Robin Cockett's 60th
  birthday. The special session organizers are Rick Blute, Pieter
  Hofstra, and Robert Seely. If you would like to talk in this session,
  please contact Rick, Pieter, or Robert.

TO GIVE A TALK:

  Participants are encouraged to give a research talk. If you wish to
  give a talk please send a title and abstract to
  selinger@mathstat.dal.ca by *** May 1 ***. Late submissions may be
  considered if there is space. All submissions will be acknowledged by
  return email.

STUDENT SUPPORT:

  Graduate student participation is encouraged at FMCS. Students will
  pay a reduced registration fee. We will also be able to provide
  limited support for travel and accommodations to students. If you are
  interested in this, please send a request to selinger@mathstat.dal.ca
  by *** May 1 ***. Please also arrange for a letter of reference from
  your supervisor, or appropriate other person, to the same email
  address.

ACCOMMODATIONS:

  We have reserved a block of rooms in Alexandra Hall at the King's
  College residences (marked in green on the interactive map
  above). The rate, including taxes, is $45.00 per night for a single
  room, and $65.00 for a double room. Reservations can be made by
  sending an e-mail to tim.ross@ukings.ca including your
  name, address, dates, and a credit card number, or calling
  (902)422-1275, ext 106. It's best to reserve this soon, as there are
  several big meetings in Halifax around this time, and we don't know
  when it might be filling up.

  For those wishing to stay in a hotel or bed & breakfast, some
  information is available on the conference website.

REGISTRATION:

  Please register for the meeting by emailing selinger@mathstat.dal.ca.
  There will be an on-site registration fee of $100 to cover meeting
  costs. A discounted registration fee is available for students and
  for researchers without grant.
