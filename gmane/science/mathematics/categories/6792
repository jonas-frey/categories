Aims and Scope

Computability is the journal of the Association Computability in Europe
and it is published by IOS Press in Amsterdam.

The journal Computability is a peer reviewed international journal that
is devoted to publishing original research of highest quality, which is
centered around the topic of computability.

The subject is understood from a multidisciplinary perspective,
recapturing the spirit of Alan Turing (1912-1954) by linking theoretical
and real-world concerns from computer science, mathematics, biology,
physics, computational neuroscience, history and the philosophy of
computing.

Computability accepts only submissions of original research papers that

elsewhere. Full versions of papers that have already been published in
conference proceedings are eligible only if the conference version is
clearly cited and the full version enhances the conference version
significantly.

Authors are requested to submit PDF manuscripts electronically via the
online submission system. Authors can indicate non-binding wishes
regarding Editorial Board Members who should handle their submission.
Final versions of accepted papers have to be prepared using the journal
style file and they need to be submitted together with all source files.

Authors submitting a manuscript do so on the understanding that they
have read and agreed to the terms of the IOS Press Author Copyright
Agreement and that all persons listed as authors have given their
approval for the submission of the paper.
