Dear Vaughan,

    I hope you will also like the following remark:
Inside any presheaf or other topos there is a canonical subcategory
which is an adjoint retract with the adjoint preserving finite products
(but not equalizers). This category is therefore cartesian closed in the
obvious way, but its special property is that any two maps from X to Y are
distinguished by a map from 1 to X. It is never a topos and its exactness
properties are rather bad, but it does recapture classical restrictions in
many cases. For example, within the Boolean algebra classifier
(=presheaves on the category of non-empty finite sets) this canonical
subcategory is the category of all classical simplicial complexes, a
"higher dimensional" version of your remark about undirected graphs.

    Let me take this opportunity to make another remark about undirected
graphs. They are treated on pages 176 - 180 in the book by Bob Rosebrugh
and me where in particular the two kinds of loops are clearly pointed out.
But I like Steve Schanuel's proposal of a way of picturing these objects:
there is a "geometric realization" functor from undirected graphs to
topological spaces which preserves all colimits ("gluing") (but not finite
limits), namely the Kan extension of the covariant inclusion of the monoid
into topological spaces which interprets the involution as  1-t on the
unit interval. Since the one-lane "loop" is the coequalizer of two maps
from I to I in the graph topos, the same coequalizer statement remains
true for the geometric realizations. Therefore, the resulting picture of
the one-lane loop is as a cul-de-sac, with one starting point, a
parameterization which goes until t=1/2, then returns to the starting
point, without encountering any other points. For example, the truth
value "foray" can be pictured this way. This flattened loop picture
not only has the foregoing rigorous justification but should make
visualizing the objects less nerve-wracking. Of course, the two-lane loops
are now pictured simply as loops, parameterized in two canonical ways
by the unit interval.

Bill
