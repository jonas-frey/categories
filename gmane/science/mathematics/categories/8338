Ah, it figures I would leave something out in my first post here.  My
apologies to all of you that were scratching your heads over the
missing rules for composition.  At least five of you have responded
with essentially the same question, so this will be sort of a blanket
response.

Composition of (f,g,h): A --> B through X and (f',g',h'): B --> C
through Y will go through the biproduct X (+) Y with (f'f, [f'g, g'],
[h, h'(f+gh)]^T): A --> C.  That is, the first component composes in
the usual way, the second component is a row matrix, and the third
component is a column matrix.  In the original category, the various
morphisms in the composed triple correspond to A --> B --> C,
directly; X --> B --> C and Y --> C; and A --> X and A --> B --> Y,
where this A --> B is f+gh rather than f.

Identity morphisms in the new category are those with f=id and the
zero object for X, which uniquely determines g and h.  The embedding I
mentioned of the original category into the new category is a functor,
after all.

Best,
Jason
