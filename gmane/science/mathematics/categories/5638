What about the characterization of limits in terms of products and
equalizers? It states that the limit of a functor F:J->C is
constructed by products indexed by the set(oid) of objects and the
set(oid) of arrows of J. But if you don't allow equality on objects in
J, you only have a preset of object, not a set(oid).
