Dear colleagues,


although this petition may be useful, I think there is much more to be=20
done here.

For the time being, it is quite difficult to boycott any commercial=20
publisher unless you are an experienced sommit=C3=A9 in your domain. For=20
instance, PhD students need to publish in highly-rated journals or=20
conferences, which are almost always associated to a publisher like=20
Elsevier or Springer. To fight this situation, and as in the case of the=20
free software movement, the best strategy is in my view to develop a=20
high-quality alternative to commercial scientific publishing. For=20
instance, the said sommit=C3=A9s could join (or create) programme and edi=
ting=20
committees of journals and conferences publishing only under a=20
totally-open access scheme (i.e gratis for authors and readers, as well=20
as under a "free" licence, such as the Creative Commons - Attribution -=20
Share-Alike licence). As a matter of fact, as most know, this is already=20
the case with publications such as TAC or LMCS and with conferences=20
relying on the EPTCS proceedings. Besides, it is easy to setup a site as=20
an ArXiv overlay to rely on the long-lastingness of this publication=20
platform. In ten years or so, with such committees and a good editing=20
policy, such journals or conferences will be as well ranked as=20
commercial ones.

However the subscription to the Elsevier or Springer electronic library=20
will be needed for a long time, just to be able to get digitized=20
versions of papers from the second half of the last century. This is a=20
second, trickier, battlefield in the sense that the figth here must be=20
carried on the copyright front. First, the copyright now extends far too=20
long after the author's death. Secondly, some publishers, when=20
digitizing some work, state wrongly that they perform a creative step,=20
which prolongs their copyright by "resetting" the creation date. Here,=20
the fight can almost only be solved by advocating politicians.

All the best
