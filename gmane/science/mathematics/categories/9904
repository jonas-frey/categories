CLOSING CALL FOR PAPERS

Applied Category Theory 2019

July 15-19, 2019, Oxford, UK

http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ACT2019/ <http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ACT2019/>

          * * *

Applied category theory is a topic of interest for a growing community =
of researchers, interested in studying systems of all sorts using =
category-theoretic tools. These systems are found in the natural =
sciences and social sciences, as well as in computer science, =
linguistics, and engineering. The background and experience of our =
members is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the =
ACT2019 Conference is to bring the majority of researchers in the field =
together and provide a platform for exposing the progress in the area.  =
Both original research papers as well as extended abstracts of work =
submitted/accepted/published elsewhere will be considered. =20

There will be best paper award(s) and selected contributions will be =
awarded extended keynote slots.

The conference will include a business showcase and tutorials, and there =
also will be an adjoint school, the following week (see webpage).

IMPORTANT DATES

Submission of contributed papers: 10 May
Acceptance/Rejection notification: 7 June

SUBMISSIONS

 Prospective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the =
following:

- Original contributions of high quality work consisting of a 5-12 page =
extended abstract that provides sufficient evidence of results of =
genuine interest and enough detail to allow the program committee to =
assess the merits of the work. Submissions of works in progress are =
encouraged but must be more substantial than a research proposal.

- Extended abstracts describing high quality work submitted/published =
elsewhere will also be considered, provided the work is recent and =
relevant to the conference.  These consist of a maximum 3 page =
description and should include a link to a separate published paper or =
preprint.

The conference proceedings will be published in a dedicated Proceedings =
issue of the new Compositionality journal:

http://www.compositionality-journal.org =
<http://www.compositionality-journal.org/>

Only "original contributions" are eligible to be published in the =
proceedings.

Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX, and must be submitted in PDF =
format. Use of the Compositionality style is encouraged. Submission is =
done via EasyChair:
