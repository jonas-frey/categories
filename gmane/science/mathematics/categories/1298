           First Irish Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of 
            Computer Science and Information Technology, MFCSIT2000 
                    National University of Ireland, Cork
                          20th and 21st July, 2000 
                                      
                           FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS


Background

MFCSIT2000 is the first conference to be held in Ireland with a focus on
mathematical and foundational issues arising out of Computer Science and IT.
There has been a very significant increase in Ireland over the last few
years in 
activities relating to the production of software and hardware by some of
the major
computer manufacturers. This conference is intended to be a forum for
discussion
of related theoretical questions.

Topics

The intended coverage of the conference includes: Semantics of Procedural
and Declarative Programming Languages, Logic in Computer Science,
Categorical and Topological aspects of Computer Science, Computer
Algebra Systems in Mathematics, Number Theory in Computer Science.
Especially welcome are papers which broadly relate to the interests of the
main speakers and which therefore fall into one or other of two main themes:
(i) Mathematical Foundations of Computational Logic and Artificial
Intelligence,
and Categorical, Domain-Theoretic and Topological Methods in Computer Science,
(ii) Computer Algebra Systems in Mathematics. 

Invited Speakers

Confirmed main speakers are
   Abbas Edalat (Imperial College)
   Dick Hamlet (University of Portland, Oregon)
   Giorgio Levi (University of Pisa)
   Dana Scott (Carnegie Mellon University)
   
Steering Committee

James Bowen (NUI, Cork), Ted Hurley (NUI, Galway), Micheal MacanAirchinnigh
(Trinity College, Dublin), Michel Schellekens (NUI, Cork), Anthony K.
Seda (NUI, Cork)

Programme Co-Chairs

Ted Hurley (NUI, Galway) and Anthony K. Seda (NUI, Cork)
   
Publication of Proceedings

Papers will be refereed, and it is expected that the Conference proceedings
(or a selection thereof) will appear as a volume in ENTCS, Elsevier's series
"Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science".

Sponsorship

The Conference is being sponsored by
The Arts Faculty, NUI, Cork
The Department of Computer Science, NUI, Cork
The Department of Mathematics, NUI, Galway
The School of Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics, NUI, Cork
Enterprise Ireland
Logic Programming Associates, London
The National Software Directorate, Dublin

Important Dates

   Abstract submission: abstracts of one page in length should be submitted
   electronically to   aks@ucc.ie   by 1st May, 2000; talks will be of 30
minutes
   duration including 5 minutes for questions. 
   Conference dates: 20th and 21st July, 2000.
   Full paper submissions: papers of not more than 18 pages in length should
   be submitted electronically by 15th August, 2000 to   aks@ucc.ie   in
   LaTeX, Postscript or PDF format. Papers must be original and not submitted
   for publication elsewhere, although survey papers of sufficiently high
   quality may be considered.
   Notification of acceptance: authors will be notified of the refereeing
   decision by 31st October, 2000.
   Final versions of papers: authors should return final versions of papers
   by 30th November, 2000.

should be mailed to: 
Anthony K. Seda, 
Department of Mathematics, 
National
University of Ireland - Cork, 
Cork, 
Ireland  
so as to arrive on or before the submission deadline.
