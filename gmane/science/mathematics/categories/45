But it's not a constructive theorem that every such x has a binary expansion.
That's still a neat result, that the binary reals are given by N^N,
but the binary reals aren't constructively the same as the reals.

In the topos of sheaves on the real line,
every function from [0,1) to N is constant,
yet there are obviously many other functions from N^N to N.
Thus N^N and [0,1) are not constructively isomorphic as sets,
so there is no way to give N^N the order type of [0,1) constructively.
