The Grothendieck Construction provides a somewhat trivial answer: a =
category fibered over Cat, where the fiber over each category is that =
category. But the object class of this fibered category does not live in =
the same universe as the object classes of the objects of Cat. Moreover, =
this construction is very redundant: eg each category A is disjoint from =
the category A+A, which consists of two copies of A.=20

So the question is really: How can we glue together large families of =
categories in a less redundant way? For toposes, the answer seems ti be =
Gros Topos. Is this gluing business essentially topological, or are =
there other views?

just my 2c.
