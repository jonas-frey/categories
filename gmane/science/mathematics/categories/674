                            MPC '98

               Fourth International Conference on

               MATHEMATICS OF PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION
               -----------------------------------

             http://www.md.chalmers.se/Conf/MPC98/

                      June 15 - 17, 1998

                       Marstrand, Sweden



                    Post-conference workshops:

        * Workshop on Generic Programming, WGP'98
          http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/conf/wgp/

        * International Workshop on Constructive Methods for
          Parallel Programming, CMPP'98
          http://brahms.fmi.uni-passau.de/cl/cmpp98/index.html

        * Formal Techniques for Hardware and Hardware-like
          Systems, FTH'98
          http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~ms/FTH98/


The general theme of this series of conferences is the use of crisp,
clear mathematics in the discovery and design of algorithms and in the
development of corresponding software or hardware. The conference
theme reflects the growing interest in formal, mathematically based
methods for the construction of software and hardware. The goal of the
MPC conferences is to report on and significantly advance the state of
the art in this area. Previous conferences were held in 1989 at
Twente, The Netherlands, organised by the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, in
1992 at Oxford, United Kingdom, and in 1995 at Kloster Irsee, Germany,
organised by Augsburg University.

Invited speakers:
  
  Burghard von Karger (Kiel University)
  John Hughes (Chalmers Technical University)
  David Harel (Weizmann Institute)

                             VENUE

Marstrand is a small island on the beautiful westcoast of Sweden, 40
km from Göteborg. The charming old houses, the fortress, the walking
paths, and the absence of cars make this island a very pleasant
resort. There are direct flights to Göteborg Landvetter from most
European main cities, and busses from Göteborg to Marstrand.
