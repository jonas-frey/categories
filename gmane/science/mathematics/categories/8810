                                FMCS 2016
        24th Workshop on Foundational Methods in Computer Science
                  University of British Columbia, VANCOUVER, Canada
                          JUNE 2-5, 2016

                            FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

                                  * * *

   The Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia(UBC)
   in cooperation with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences(PIMS)
   is hosting the Foundational Methods in Computer Science(FMCS) workshop
   on June 2-5, 2016, on the UBC campus in Vancouver, Canada

   The workshop is an annual informal meeting intended to bring together
   researchers in mathematics and computer science. There is a focus
   on the application of category theory in computer science. However, all
   those who are interested in category theory or computer science are
   welcome to attend.

   There will be a welcoming reception on Thursday June 2. The
   scientific program starts on June 3, and consists of a day of
   tutorials aimed at graduate students and those new to the field, as
   well as a day and a half of research talks. The meeting ends at
   1pm on Sunday June 5.

   Research talks

   There will be some invited presentations, but the majority of the
   talks are solicited from the participants. If you wish to give a talk
   please send a title and abstract to johnm@math.ubc.ca. Time slots are
   limited, so please let us know early if you would like to be
   considered for a talk.

   Graduate student participation is particularly encouraged at FMCS.

   Accommodations

   A block of rooms will be reserved for participants on the UBC campus.
   If you plan on coming to the meeting please send a brief email to
   johnm@math.ubc.ca with the words "will attend" or "may attend" in the
   subject line. For those planning on bringing students along, please
   include estimated number, thus allowing us to better plan for room
   requirements and other logistics.

   The Second Announcement, with links to the conference webpage, will be
   out soon, containing details regarding registration and accommodation.
