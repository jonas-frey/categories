(1) Please re-read.  I think the comments you're referring to are from 
Mumford, not Serre.

(2) It's only natural that each mathematician prefers his/her own style -- 
I do mathematics the way I like it to be done.  The same brain is both 
generator and recognizer.  I find my own jokes funny for exactly the same 
reason!
