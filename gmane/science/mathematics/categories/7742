The team Logique de la Programmation (LDP) of the Institut de =
Math=E9matiques
de Luminy (IML) in Marseille, France, is inviting applications for a
postdoctoral position in proof theory.
Do not hesitate to forward the announcement to anyone interested


Context
----------

The team LDP pursues its research mainly in proof theory and theory of
computation. In particular, we are currently involved in two national =
research
projects:

- The LOGOI project pursues the programme of Geometry of Interaction =
(GoI),
   which aims at a reconstruction of logic from interaction as the =
primitive
   notion, considered as an abstract counterpart of cut elimination. This
   programme has started together with linear logic and has evolved since =
its
   early days, from the limited case of multiplicatives to recent =
developments
   involving the theory of von Neumann algebras and providing a =
strikingly new
   perspective on implicit complexity via light logics.

- The RECRE project aims at developing a better understanding of the
   computational interpretation of proofs in classical logic, in =
particular
   using the tools and recent results of classical realizability. This
   relates to a wide range of topics from pure mathematical logic =
(forcing,
   model theory) to theory of programming languages (type systems, =
control
   operators), through category theory and type theory.

The common goals of these projects are on one side to better understand =
and
refine the interactive aspects of proof theory (GoI, game semantics, =
etc.) and
on the other side to draw on the novel tools and concepts provided by =
these
domains, in order to propose new structured approaches to proof theory =
and
strengthen its connections with other areas of computer science.


Post Doctoral Position
-------------------------------

This is a full-time research position for one year. It is expected to =
start at
the beginning of fall 2013 (between 1 Sep. and 1 Oct.). Research will =
take
place at the IML in Marseille. The successful applicant is of course =
expected
to participate to the activities of the LDP team (workshops, meetings,
tutorials).


Requirements
-----------------

Applicants must hold a PhD degree in computer science or mathematics, =
and
should have a strong background in logic and proof theory. Skills in an
additional area of computer science (complexity, concurrency, =
programming
language semantics, etc.) are very welcome.

If the PhD thesis is not defended yet, the candidate must provide the =
planned
defence date and the composition of the thesis committee.

Knowledge of French is not required.


Application
-----------

To apply, please send an email to postdoc-ldp@iml.univ-mrs.fr, including =
your
current CV, a link to a list of your publications, and a research =
statement
summarizing your research activities and goals (preferably two pages at =
most).
You might also include the names of up to two references.

The deadline for applications is 20 june 2013.
