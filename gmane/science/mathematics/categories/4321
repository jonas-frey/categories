As Fred says, the semimodules over a given semiring are=20
determined by operations and equations, and so are complete
and cocomplete. In terms of exactness properties they are
also=20

(i) locally finitely presentable (so that finite limits commute
with filtered colimits, and=20
(ii) Barr-exact (so that there is an equivalence between quotients
and congruences)

If we restrict to the cancellative case, we still have completeness
and  cocompleteness and (i), but (ii) fails. =20
