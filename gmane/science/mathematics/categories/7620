announcement]

FINAL CALL FOR PARTICIPATION=20
AND INVITATION TO DISCUSSION
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
8th International Workshop on=20
Applied and Computational Category Theory=20
ACCAT 2013

Satellite Event of ETAPS 2013, Rome, March 17 2013
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Deadline for online registration: March 8

*Attendees are warmly invited to join the closing discussion. Please =
communicate your intention to deliver a position statement to the =
organizers.*

Since the 1960s, the use of category theory in computer science has been =
a fruitful one, ranging form automata theory to algebraic specification =
to programming languages.

In recent years techniques and methods from CT have been adopted as a =
standard research tool, and considered as such in different venues =
around the world. The ACCAT workshop on "Applied and Computational =
Category Theory" has been one of these venues. Since its inception in =
2006, ACCAT provided a forum where invited contributors presented their =
own research on different facets of category theory applied to computer =
science.

Despite ACCAT success, we believe that the formula should be revised. =
Indeed, we have the feeling that a conference is missing where all kinds =
of applications of category theory to computer science can be presented =
(like the former CTCS conference, which somehow ended in 2006). This =
year, we would like to use the ACCAT forum to raise this issue and to =
discuss it within a larger audience.

Thus, we invited 8 top researched in the area of application of category =
theory. The list of speakers are=20

Samson Abramsky
Robin B. Cockett
Barbara Koenig
Ugo Montanari
Till Mossakowski
Dusko Pavlovic
Andrzej Tarlecki
Glynn Winskel

We do hope that the meeting will be fruitful, providing a good exchange =
of ideas and planting the seed for future events. Indeed, one of the =
outcome of the meeting is to decide whether to push an high-level =
workshop/conference on the application of category theory to computer =
science, or at least to verify the viability of a Daghstul meeting on =
the issue. Therefore, after the presentations, the workshop will end up =
with a general discussion among the attendees.=
