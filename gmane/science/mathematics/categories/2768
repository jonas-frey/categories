It is purely a property of compactness.  Take the product of compact
spaces.  The condition of an element of the product being in the limit is
the conjunction of infinitely many conditions each of which says that two
coordinates agree and if it is a chain (or, in fact, an inverse filtered
diagram) of non-empty compact sets, each of those finitely many conditions
defines a closed non-empty subset with the finite intersection property.

So the general context is that an inverse filtered limit of non-empty
compact Hausdorff spaces is non-empty.  Although I don't seem to have used
Hausdorffness, it is required to show those sets are closed.  And without
it, you could get the example Tom described using the trivial topology,
which is certainly compact.  I guess you could use the finite complement
topology to get a T1 counterexample.
