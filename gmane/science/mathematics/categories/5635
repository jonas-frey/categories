The University of Leicester has an international reputation for its
research and teaching.  In order to build further on the
recent successes of the Department of Computer Science, the University
is making a strategic investment by creating three new lectureships in
computer science. =20

The successful candidates will have a strong research record, with a
background in the theoretical foundations of computer science, and will
be able to contribute to undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and
supervision of mainstream projects in a broad range of topics.=20

We are keen to make appointments that will contribute to our research
excellence in either the foundations of computational models, processes
or structures, or the way they support the engineering of
software-intensive systems, including socio-technical systems.  Ability
to teach software re-engineering, software measurement and quality, or
web technologies would be desirable.  Ability to attract funding
or engage with industry are other aspects that we will rate very highly.

Closing date for applications: April 9th

Invitations for the interview: after April 19th
