CSR 2008: First Call for Papers
3rd International Computer Science Symposium in Russia
June 7-12, 2008, Moscow, Russia

Organizers: Dorodnicyn Computing Centre of Russian Academy of Sciences,
Institute for System Programming of Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow
State University,
Moscow Institute of Open Education, Institute of New Technologies.

Opening lecture: Avi Wigderson (IAS, Princeton).

CSR 2008 is the third conference in a series of regular events started with
CSR 2006 in St.Petersburg (see LNCS 3967) and CSR 2007 in Ekaterinburg (see
LNCS 4649). It intends to reflect the broad scope of international
cooperation in computer science. CSR 2008 consists of two tracks: Theory
Track and Applications and Technology Track.

Program committee of Theory Track: Sergei Artemov, Matthias Baaz, Boaz
Barak, Lev Beklemishev, Harry Buhrman, Andrei Bulatov, Evgeny Dantsin,
Volker Diekert, Anna Frid, Andreas Goerdt, Andrew Goldberg, Dima Grigoriev,
Yuri Gurevich, Edward Hirsch, Nicole Immorlica, Pascal Koiran, Michal
Koucky, Yury Makarychev, Yuri Matiyasevich, Alexander Razborov (chair),
Victor Selivanov, Alexander Shen, Helmut Veith, Nikolai Vereshchagin, Sergey
Yekhanin.

Program committee of Applications and Technology Track includes Robert
Bauer, Egon Boerger, Stephane Bressan, Gabriel Ciobanu, Maxim Grinev,
Michael Kishinevsky, Gregory Kucherov, Alexandre Petrenko, Andreas Reuter,
Anatol Slissenko (chair), Elena Troubitsyna, Andrei Voronkov, Sergey Zhukov.


Conference chair: Alexei Semenov.

Theory Track topics include
* algorithms and data structures;
* complexity and cryptography;
* formal languages and automata;
* computational models and concepts;
* proof theory and applications of logic to computer science.

Application Track topics include
* artificial intelligence;
* bio-informatics;
* computer architecture, hardware design, nanotechnology;
* databases and knowledge bases, information retrieval and search, Web
technologies;
* numerical and symbolic computing;
* programming for parallel computing;
* software development and software validation methods and tools.

Submissions: Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or a full
paper of at most 10 pages preferably in the LNCS format. Proofs and other
material omitted due to space constraints are to be put into a clearly
marked appendix to be read at discretion of the referees. Papers must
present original (and not previously published) research. Simultaneous
submissions to journals or to other conferences with published proceedings
are not allowed. The proceedings of the symposium will be published in
Springer's LNCS series.

Important dates:
* Paper submission (via EasyChair): December 9, 2007.
* Notification: February 8, 2008.
* Symposium: June 7-12, 2008.
