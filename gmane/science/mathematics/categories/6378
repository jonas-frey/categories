The preprint:  "Differential Restriction Categories"
                is now available from
http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gscruttw/publications.html

Authors: Robin Cockett, Geoff Cruttwell, and Jonathan Gallagher

The paper takes the setting for differential calculus described by
Blute, Cockett, and Seely (TAC, Vol22, 209) and shows how to extend it to
partially defined maps. A basic model is the category of smooth maps
defined on open subsets of R^n, but the paper also describes another clas=
s
of important models.

To achieve this extension, the paper combines Cartesian differential
categories with restriction categories.  This involves describing,
initially, what "left additive" structure is for restriction categories
and what it means for a partial map to be "additive".  Once this is
established
can one add, and axiomatize, a differential operator much as for Cartesia=
n
differential categories.

The paper presents -- in detail -- the differential restriction category
of rational functions over an arbitrary commutative ring.  The example is=
,
from the point of view of algebraic geometry, relatively standard.=20
However, the development allows the structure to be viewed from a more
unified categorical perspective than was hitherto possible.
Differentiation in this example is the usual formal differentiation of
rational functions with partiality arising from "poles".  Much of the
technical difficulty
arises in giving an explicit description of the underlying restriction
structure.  Somewhat surprisingly this works best at the level of
commutative rigs: negatives are only needed for differentiation
of fractions.

The paper ends by showing that differential restriction structure is
closed to two important constructions: the join completion and the
classical completion.  The former is important as it is the jumping off
point for examining differential structure in manifold categories, and so
for describing general "tangent bundles".  The latter is somewhat
surprising: it shows  that one can always reason classically about smooth
maps; however, it also means one must allow functions defined on domains
consisting of a single "point" to be differentiable!
