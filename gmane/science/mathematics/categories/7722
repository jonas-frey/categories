Hi, Emily,

Another example of interesting classes of "objects those X in C such =

that the unit X -> MX is an isomorphism" (C a pleasant category, M a =

(perhaps familiar) monoid on C):

As C, use the category either of vector spaces, or of Banach spaces =

(if the latter, use linear maps of bound not exceeding 1); and as M =

use the corresponding double-dualization monoid. =


Then: among vector spaces, it's the finite-dimensional ones for which =

the unit is an isomorphism; among Banach spaces, it's the reflexive ones.=


So again, behavior with respect to limits is, in either case, not =

(TTBOMK) as you[r grad student] might wish.

Cheers, -- Fred
