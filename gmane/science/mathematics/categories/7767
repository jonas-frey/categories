I'm pleased to see the items quoted from Coecke include "string =
diagrams" as they are now called.

Although they occur first in Kelly and Laplaza's paper on coherence for =
compact closed categories, and again
in Street's work with Joyal in the mid-80's, I think I was the first =
person to use them, in public at least, in the form
with "coupons" (to borrow the term Reshtikhin and Turaev used a few =
months later) to represent maps
which aren't inherent in the (braided or symmetric compact closed) =
monoidal structure.

Best Thoughts,
David Y.
