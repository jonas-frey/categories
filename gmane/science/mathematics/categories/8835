Call for Participation

MIDLANDS GRADUATE SCHOOL IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING SCIENCE

MGS 2016

11-15 April 2016, University of Birmingham

http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/mgs2016/

OVERVIEW

The Midlands Graduate School in the Foundations of Computing Science
(MGS) was established in 1999 as a collaboration between researchers
at the Universities of Birmingham, Leicester, Nottingham, and later
Sheffield. It has two main goals: to equip PhD students with a sound
basis for their research by deepening their knowledge on the
mathematical and conceptual foundations of computing; and to provide a
platform for making contacts with established researchers in the field
and with their peers who are at a similar stage in their research
careers.

This year's MGS is hosted by the School of Computer Science at the
  University of Birmingham. It will start on 11 April and finish on 15 April.

Information about previous events can be found at

http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/MGS

PROGRAMME

MGS 2016 consists of ten courses, each with four or five hours of
lectures and exercise sessions. Three of the courses are introductory
or core; they should be taken by all participants. The other courses
are more advanced or specialised. Participants may select them
depending on their interests.

This year the invited lectures will be given by Prof Steve Brookes,
Carnegie Mellon University.

In addition there will be a session in which participants
can briefly present and discuss their own research.

Core Courses:

* Category Theory, Venanzio Capretta, Nottingham
* Naive Type Theory, Thorsten Altenkirch, Nottingham
* Denotational Semantics, Achim Jung, Birmingham

Advanced Courses:

* A Denotational Semantics for Weak Memory Concurrency, Steve Brookes,
Carnegie Mellon University
* Game Semantics, Dan Ghica, Birmingham
* Introduction to Coalgebra, Alexander Kurz, Leicester
* Security Protocol Verification, Eike Ritter, Birmingham
* Linear Logic, Neelakantan Krishnaswami, Birmingham
* Distributed Systems and Choreographies, Emilio Tuosto, Leicester
* LL and LR Parsing with Abstract Machines, Hayo Thielecke, Birmingham
