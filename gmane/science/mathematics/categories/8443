Hi all,

I am writing in hopes that I might pick the collective brain of the =
categories list. This spring, I will be teaching an undergraduate-level =
category theory course, entitled =E2=80=9CCategory theory in context=E2=80=
=9D:

http://www.math.harvard.edu/~eriehl/161

It has two aims:=20

(i) To provide a thorough =E2=80=9CCambridge-style=E2=80=9D introduction =
to the basic concepts of category theory: representability, (co)limits, =
adjunctions, and monads.

(ii) To revisit as many topics as possible from the typical =
undergraduate curriculum, using category theory as a guide to deeper =
understanding.

For example, when I was an undergraduate, I could never remember whether =
the axioms for a group action required the elements of the group to act =
via *automorphisms*. But after learning what might be called the first =
lemma in category theory -- that functors preserve isomorphisms -- I =
never worried about this point again.

Over the past few months I have been collecting examples that I might =
use in the course, with the focus on topics that are the most =
=E2=80=9Csociologically important=E2=80=9D (to quote Tom Leinster=E2=80=99=
s talk at CT2014) and also the most illustrative of the categorical =
concept in question. (After all, aim (i) is to help my students =
internalize the categorical way of thinking!)

Here are a few of my favorites:

* The Brouwer fixed point theorem, proving that any continuous =
endomorphism of the disk admits a fixed point, admits a slick proof =
using the functoriality of the fundamental group functor pi_1 : Top_* =
=E2=80=94> Gp. Assuming the contrapositive, you can define a continuous =
retraction of the inclusion S^1 =E2=80=94> D^2. Applying pi_1 leads to =
the contradiction 1=3D0.

* The inverse image of a function f : A =E2=80=94> B, regarded as a =
functor f* : P(B) =E2=80=94> P(A) between the posets of subsets of its =
codomain and domain, admits both adjoints and thus preserves both =
intersections and unions. By contrast, the direct image, a left adjoint, =
preserves only unions.

* Any discrete group G can be regarded as a one-object groupoid in which =
case a covariant Set-valued functor is just a G-set. The unique =
represented functor is the G-set G, with its translation (left =
multiplication) action. By contrast, a *representable* functor X, not =
yet equipped with the natural ($G$-equivariant) isomorphism $G \cong X$ =
defining the representation, is a $G$-torsor. I learned this from John =
Baez=E2=80=99s this week=E2=80=99s finds:

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/torsors.html

My favorite example is still the one that John uses: n-dimensional =
affine space is most naturally a R^n-torsor.

* The universal property defining the tensor product V @ W as the =
initial vector space receiving a bilinear map=20

@ : V x W =E2=80=94> V @ W

can be used to extract its construction. The projection to the quotient =
V @ W =E2=80=94> V @ W/<v @ w> by the vector space spanned by the image =
of the bilinear map @ must restrict along @ to the zero bilinear map, as =
of course does the zero map. Thus V @ W must be isomorphic to the span =
of the vectors v @ w, modulo the bilinearity relations.

* By the existence of discrete and indiscrete spaces, all of the limits =
and colimits one meets in point-set topology -- products, gluings, =
quotients, subspaces -- are given by topologizing the (co)limits of the =
underlying sets. Of course this contradicts our experience with the =
constructions of colimits in algebra.

* On that topic, the construction of the tensor product of commutative =
rings or the free product of groups can be understood as special cases =
of the general construction of coproducts in an EM-category admitting =
coequalizers.

I would be very grateful to hear about other favorite examples which =
illustrate or are clarified by the categorical way of thinking. My view =
of what might be accessible to undergraduates is relatively expansive, =
particularly in the less-obviously-categorical areas of mathematics such =
as analysis.

I have also posted this query to the n-Category Cafe and am hoping to =
collect examples there as well:

Best wishes to all for a happy and productive new year.
