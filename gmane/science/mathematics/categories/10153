The EPIT is a French thematic school proposing, on an yearly basis, an =
intensive 5-day long training,=20
specializing on a particular topic in theoretical computer science. It =
is primarily addressed to PhD students,=20
Post-doctoral researchers and junior academics.

The 2020 edition of the EPIT will be centered around Homotopy Type =
Theory, a research topic at the junction=20
of Computer Science and Mathematics. Our hope is hence to provide an =
introduction that is accessible=20
to researchers in both areas.

Pre-registration is now open, please visit =
https://epit2020cnrs.inria.fr/registration/ =
<https://epit2020cnrs.inria.fr/registration/> to know more.=20

For any question, please contact epit2020@sciencesconf.org =
<mailto:epit2020@sciencesconf.org>

NB: As the number of places is limited, we have fixed a deadline for =
pre-registration to ** March 15, 2020 **.
