The space of Dedekind reals is Cauchy-complete, so any convergent
power series such as sin or cos defines an endomorphism of it.
Moreover, provided (as in this case) we can calculate a "modulus of
convergense" for the power series explicitly from a bound for x, it's easy
to see that the construction x |--> sin x commutes with inverse image
functors, so it must be induced by an endomorphism of the classifying
topos (that is, of the locale of formal reals).

That's a good question. I've never thought about notionss of finiteness
for non-discrete locales (someone should!). For the set of points of S,
I believe it should be what Peter Freyd called "R-finite" ("R" for
"Russell"): intuitively, this means that there is a bound on the size
of its K-finite subsets. (However, I don't have a proof of this.)
R-finiteness is quite a lot weaker than  \tilde{K}-finiteness (being
locally a subobject of a K-finite object), but it's still a reasonably
well-behaved notion of finiteness (e.g. it is preserved by functors
which preserve all finite limits and colimits).
