Dear all,

I am pleased to announce the inaugural Midwest Homotopy Type Theory
Seminar*, which will take place on May 26-27, 2018 at the University
of Western Ontario (London ON).

Speakers:

   Carlo Angiuli (CMU)
   Cartesian cubical type theory

   Simon Cho (Michigan)
   Weak equivalences between models of type theory

   Dan Christensen (Western)
   Localization in homotopy type theory

   Paige North (OSU)
   A directed homotopy type theory

   Robert Rose (Indiana)
   On the natural numbers in elementary (=E2=88=9E,1)-toposes

   Luis Scoccola (Western)
   Congruence closure in intensional type theory

The details, including the schedule and lodging information, can be found a=
t

We have negotiated reduced rates at DoubleTree by Hilton and the
Ontario Residence Hall. If you are thinking of booking the former,
please do so soon, as the rate will expire on April 30.

There is no formal registration process (and hence no registration
fee), but those planning to attend should contact Chris Kapulkin so
that we can make sure there is enough food and coffee for everyone.

Best,
Chris

*Yes, the name is a shameless ripoff of the Midwest Topology Seminar. Sorry=
