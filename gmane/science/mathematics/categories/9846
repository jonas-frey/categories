Dear all,

Funding is available for participation in the

Second School and Workshop on Univalent Mathematics,

to be held at the University of Birmingham (UK), April 1-5, 2019

(https://unimath.github.io/bham2019)

Details of the event are given below.

Participants ("trainees") eligible to be reimbursed:

Trainees must be engaged in an official research programme as a PhD Student
or postdoctoral fellow or can be employed by, or affiliated to, an
institution, organisation or legal entity which has within its remit a
clear association with performing research. Trainees eligible for
reimbursement:

1. Trainees from COST Full Members / COST Cooperating Member.

2. Trainees from Approved NNC Institutions.

3. Trainees from Approved European RTD Organisations.

COST member countries are listed on

Overview

========

Homotopy Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies

a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type

theory. This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of

Univalent Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics

based on ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.

The UniMath library is a large repository of computer-checked

mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. It is based on the

computer proof assistant Coq.

In this school and workshop, we aim to introduce newcomers to the ideas

of Univalent Foundations and mathematics therein, and to formalizing

mathematics in a computer proof assistant based on Univalent Foundations.

Format

=======

We will have two tracks:

- Beginners track

- Advanced track: suitable for participants with some experience in

Univalent Foundations and the proof assistant Coq.

In the beginners track, you will receive an introduction to Univalent

Foundations and to mathematics in those foundations, by leading experts

in the field. In the accompanying problem sessions, you will formalize

pieces of univalent mathematics in the UniMath library.

In the advanced track, you will work, in a small group, on formalizing a

specific topic in UniMath, guided by an expert in univalent mathematics.

Your code will become part of the UniMath library.

Application and funding

=======================
