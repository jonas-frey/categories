The Eduard Cech center had been established in 2005 and, since 2012,
it continues as the national research center focusing its attention
to interactions between algebra, geometry, and mathematical physics.
The participating institutions are Faculty of Science of Masaryk University
in Brno, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University
in Prague, Institute of Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech
Republic and the Mathematics Institute of the Silesian University in Opava
(see http://eci.sci.muni.cz).

The Center invites applications for several research positions commencing
during the academic year 2014/2015 at the date depending on mutual agreement.
The positions are initially for one year with a possibility of extension.
The candidates must be recent PhD's and should submit a letter of application
accompanied by a CV, list of publications and an outline of their research
project to Professor Jiri Rosicky (rosicky@math.muni.cz) not later than

                                March 15, 2014.

They should also arrange for at least 2 letters of recommendation (one can
be from a Czech mathematician) to be mailed directly to rosicky@math.muni.cz
before March 15, 2014. The successful applicants will be notified as soon
as possible but not later than April 30, 2014.
