Dear All,

Let me put this in a context for non-UK readers of this list.  Various=20
bodies in the UK are asking for `impact' as part of their assessment of=20
research.  This is in particular true of the REF exercise. (Perhaps=20
someone else can comment on this as well as I am `out of this', having=20
been a victim of a previous round of such `exercises'.) We all know that=20
mathematics is central to modern technological developments, but pure=20
mathematics finds itself in the position of having  little direct IMPACT=20
as measured in the way that the nebulous THEY (i.e. the bean counters)=20
have defined it. We thus have that a sociologist can say that their=20
research resulted in  (whatever), a physicist can point to a new=20
technical development, whilst a pure mathematician is left saying=20
`doh!'. This may have, unless watched, very serious implications for=20
category theory as between us and the areas with IMPACT there seems to=20
be a wide gulf, at least to the outsider. (When money is short, people=20
fight over what little there is with enthusiasm!)

This may have also an impact on the recrutement of new researchers, so=20
someone working in PDEs is likely to be viewed as potentially having=20
more impact than someone working in category theory. (If you think that=20
as you are not in the UK then you need not worry, and that your research=20
organisations are not going to behave so stupidly,..... )

There is a wiki (at lmsrefresponse dot wordpress dot com <- and I hope=20
this is ok with the list rules about links replace dot by . of course)=20
which some of you may want to look at. The London Math Soc does not seem=20
that sure as to how to best treat the situation.

(I would request, that if someone on the list wants to discuss IMPACT,=20
that they look at the lms pages first. If they go to the LMS main page=20
then to `policy' and look for impact they should find it and various=20
related documents. Please restrict attention to category theory, as that=20
is very vulnerable as quite a few other mathematicians have a negative=20
attitude to it.)

Tim
