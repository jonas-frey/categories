The great thing about categories is that they allow analogies between
different mathematical structures: see the paper
R. Brown and  T. Porter) `Category Theory: an abstract setting for
analogy and comparison', In: What is Category Theory? Advanced
Studies in Mathematics and Logic, Polimetrica Publisher, Italy,
(2006) 257-274.
An example of the analogy is between the category of sets and the category
of directed graphs:
``Higher order symmetry of graphs'', {\em Bull. Irish Math.
Soc.} 32 (1994) 46-59.
Here one easily sees non Boolean logics, of course.

The word `analogy' seems to be underused in teaching undergraduates, but
that is what abstraction is about, is it not? A teacher told me after a
lecture on knots that was the first time he had heard the word analogy used
in relation to mathematics! ( I discussed prime knots.)

The other possibility is to advertise categorical structures: I advertised
higher dimensional algebra to an international  conference of
neuroscientists in Delhi in 2003, pointing out the unlikelihood of the brain
working entirely serially, and also the concept of colimit with an email
analogy. A senior Indian neuroscientist came up to me afterwards and said
that was the first time he had heard a seminar by a mathematician which made
any sense! This is written up in
(R. Brown and  T. Porter), `Category theory and higher dimensional
algebra: potential descriptive tools in neuroscience', Proceedings
of the International Conference on Theoretical Neurobiology,
Delhi, February 2003, edited by Nandini Singh, National Brain
Research Centre, Conference Proceedings 1 (2003) 80-92.

or my home page.

See also
http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/outofline/out-home.html
for a general talk.

As said before, I see higher dimensional algebra as the study of
mathematical structures with operations defined under geometrical
conditions, thus allowing a combination of algebra and geometry, in a way
which even Atiyah might like (see his paper on `20th century mathematics'
Bull LMS 44  (2002) 1-15, in which the words `category' and `groupoid' do
not appear).

I have found giving general talks makes one think hard about the underlying
ideas and motivation.
