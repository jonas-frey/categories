A preprint of my paper "Totally distributive categories and injective 
toposes" is now available at

http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4032

This paper subsumes the content of talks that I gave in Halifax and 
Schenectady.  An abstract is included below.

Your comments are welcome.

Abstract:  We establish a connection between the totally distributive 
categories, studied by Marmolejo, Rosebrugh, and Wood, and the injective 
and quasi-injective Grothendieck toposes, studied by Johnstone and Joyal. 
We show that every quasi-injective topos is totally distributive and that 
every injective topos is lex totally distributive.  As a partial converse, 
we show that every lex totally distributive category with a small dense 
generator is a quasi-injective topos.  In view of work of Johnstone-Joyal 
relating injective and quasi-injective toposes to continuous categories, 
our results provide partial analogues of the dual equivalence between 
continuous dcpos and completely distributive lattices (Hoffmann, Lawson) 
and its restriction to continuous lattices (Banaschewski).
