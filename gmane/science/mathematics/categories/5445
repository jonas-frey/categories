Dear Mike,

I suppose what I'm really looking for is cool algorithms like the one

described in Backhouse's paper "Fusion on Languages" (thanks, Neel!)

where they either wouldn't have been discovered without category

theory, or where category theory is the only decent way to understand

the algorithm.


While not quite what you are looking for Rydeheard and
Burstall<http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~david/categories/book/book.pdf>mig=
ht
provide a good jumping off point.

Best wishes,

--greg
