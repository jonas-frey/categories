Prior to encountering category theory, Bourbaki had a notion of
isomorphism but no general notion of morphism.  See this letter from.
Andre Weil to Claude Chevalley, Oct. 15, 1951:

\begin{quotation} As you know, my honorable colleague Mac~Lane
maintains every notion of structure necessarily brings with it a
notion of homomorphism, which consists of indicating, for each of the
data that make up the structure, which ones behave covariantly and
which contravariantly [\dots] what do you think we can gain from this
kind of consideration? (quoted in Corry  ~\cite[p. 380] Modern Algebra
and the Rise of Mathematical Structures}, Basel: Birkh{\"a}user
1996.\end{quotation}

  and, also, Bourbaki's theory of structures is very clearly a theory of a t=

  guess this might be self-evident to anyone born during the 1st half of the=
  20th century, but it has turned out to be really hard to find out for me.
