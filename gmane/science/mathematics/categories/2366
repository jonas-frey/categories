UNION COLLEGE MATHEMATICS CONFERENCE

Saturday and Sunday                          Schenectady
November 8-9, 2003                           New York

This is a preliminary announcement for the eleventh Union College
Mathematics Conference.  This year the conference topics are algebraic
topology, category theory, and differential geometry.

In addition to plenary lectures of interest to the entire Conference
audience, there will also be shorter contributed talks in parallel
sessions.  Anyone interested in giving such a talk should contact one of
the organizers.

The meeting will begin with an evening reception on Friday, November 7,
and end on Sunday afternoon.  A more detailed notice  will be mailed later
this summer.  Information will also be available at the Union College
Mathematics Department website (www.math.union.edu) in August.

Union College is centrally located in New York's capital district about 10
miles from the Albany International Airport, easily accessible by train
from NYC, and just 3 to 4 hours by car from NYC, Boston, and Montreal.

We hope to see you in November!
