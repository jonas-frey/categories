It's not an argument - I'm just reporting on what I see.

I don't really like the term "dagger-categories", and I gently
tried to get people to stop using it, but it didn't work.  They're
already comfortable with it.

I hope this is clear: "dagger-categories" are completely different
from "compact closed categories".  We need *some* term for them;
we're just arguing about whether to call them "star-categories",
"dagger-categories", or "categories with involution".  I like
"star-categories", because in analysis and quantum topology the
special case of "C*-categories" is very important.  But, I doubt
we'll reach any sort of agreement!
