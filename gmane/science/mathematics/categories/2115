Dear toposophers,

With constructivity of real arithmetic back on the front burner for the
moment, let P be the ring of bounded power series a0 + a1.x + a2.x^2 + ..=
=2E
with integer coefficients a_i, where the bound is, for each such series,
an integer c such that |a_i| < c (3/2)^i / i^(3/2).

Let 1-2x generate the ideal I of P.  Then the quotient ring P/I turns out=

to be the field of reals [AMM 105(1998), p.769].

This is more constructive than it might appear, being just an obscure
(or clear depending on your upbringing) way of representing reals in a
redundant binary notation.  The ring P permits fast arithmetic essentiall=
y
by deferring carries.  Carries are "propagated" when needed by quotientin=
g
by I, which works by collapsing every formal power series to one all of
whose coefficients other than a0 are either 0 or 1 and which has infinite=
ly
many 0s (equivalently, no infinite run of 1's).

In this view of things, a real is understoood as an integer (a0) plus a
binary fraction in [0,1) (the rest of some "binary" formal power series,
meaning one with a_i =3D 0 or 1 for i > 0 and infinitely many 0s).  A gen=
eral
formal power series without this restriction to 0 and 1 then constitutes
a redundant representation of a real, which can be made irredundant when
needed (e.g. when comparing with <) by quotienting by I.

An intuitively clear but less constructive view is to evaluate each serie=
s at
x =3D 1/2, the root of 1-2x, noting that any series bounded as above conv=
erges
absolutely there.  Series identified by I are those that evaluate to the
same real at x =3D 1/2.

What is nonconstructive about this is that direct evaluation of an infini=
te
series at a point requires infinite time, no matter how large and paralle=
l
the infinite circuit computing it may be.

In contrast, P and P/I are more constructive in the following sense.
Addition and subtraction in P require circuit depth O(1) using an infinit=
e
circuit whose gates perform integer addition and subtraction (just do it
coordinatewise).  Reduction mod I takes longer, but there is a variant of=

the above in which it is fast enough.  Instead of the field R we settle
for just the group R, and instead of |a_i| < c (3/2)^i / i^(3/2) we settl=
e
for simply |a_i| < c.  In this case any given series can be reduced (same=

generator 1-2x) to the above normal form in circuit depth log_2(c) (nice
exercise), a finite quantity despite the series itself being of infinite
length and fluctuating arbitrarily within =B1c.

Multiplication is problematic for two reasons.  First it obliges the weak=
er
bound, complicating reduction.  Secondly it is a convolution, complicatin=
g
arithmetic even when carry propagation is deferred.  I don't see obvious
solutions to either of these problems.  On the other hand I have no a pri=
ori
reason to suppose that these circuit-theoretic complications of passing
from R as a group to R as a ring or field would be reflected in suitably
constructive topos-theoretic developments of these notions.
