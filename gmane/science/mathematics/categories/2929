Indeed, at least in my case, a flow must not be viewed as a generalizatio=
n of=20
the notion of small categories. Let me explain a little bit what I am doi=
ng=20
with these objects. I was not very explicit in my previous post. And so t=
he=20
terminology I use is not in "competition".

I want to model HDA, at least those coming from precubical sets. I use a =
set=20
of states X^0 and between each state A and B of the HDA, there is a=20
topological space P_{A,B}X whose elements represent the non-constant=20
execution paths from A to B. The topology of this space models the=20
concurrency of the situation between A and B. And execution paths can be=20
composed with a strictly asssociative law. There does not necessarily exi=
st a=20
loop from a given state A to itself : so P_{A,A}X can be empty. This fact=
 is=20
one reason among several other ones why I remove the identity maps.

Inside this model, I am able to define what is a dihomotopy equivalence. =
The=20
main problem to define dihomotopy is that some contractible parts of "the=
=20
directed spaces of execution paths" must not be contracted. Otherwise in =
the=20
categorical localization, the relevant geometric information is lost. In=20
particular, initial and final states must be unchanged by a dihomotopy=20
equivalence. A very simple example : take two execution paths going from =
one=20
initial state 0 to one final state 1. If contractions in the direction of=
 time=20
are allowed, one finds in the same equivalence class a loop. Some example=
s of=20
unwanted final states are deadlocks of concurrent systems : a deadlock is=
=20
nothing else but a final state from a geometric viewpoint. Flows allow to=
=20
propose a solution of this problem : in fact I introduced this notion of=20
flows on purpose, to make the following solution work.=20

The first kind of dihomotopy equivalence is a morphism f:X->Y such that=20
f^0:X^0->Y^0 is a bijection and such that Pf:PX->PY is a weak homotopy=20
equivalence. It turns out that there is a model structure on Flows whose =
weak=20
equivalences are exactly the preceding kind of morphisms. By imposing the=
=20
condition f^0:X^0->Y^0 bijective, we do not take any risk : nothing is=20
contracted in the direction of time. So no geometric information is lost.=
 But=20
this kind of identification is too rigide ! The second kind of dihomotopy=
=20
equivalence is generated by taking a representative set of inclusions of=20
posets P1\subset P2, where P1 and P2 are finite bounded posets and where =
the=20
inclusions preserve the bottom  element and the top element (which are=20
different by hypothesis in a bounded poset). For example, the inclusion o=
f=20
posets {0<1}\subset{0<A<1} represents the directed segment (going from th=
e=20
initial state 0 to the final state 1) identified with the composition of =
two=20
directed segments. This second kind of dihomotopy equivalence models=20
"refinement of observation". Of course, initial and final states are stil=
l=20
preserved.

The category of flows up to dihomotopy equivalences is between the homoto=
py=20
category of the model structure associated to the first kind of dihomotop=
y=20
equivalence and the homotopy category of the Bousfield localization of th=
e=20
same model structures with respect to the set of Q(P_1\subset P_2) where =
Q is=20
the cofibrant replacement functor. I call the weak equivalences of the=20
Bousfield localization "quasi-dihomotopy". Morally speaking, quasi-dihomo=
topy=20
is like dihomotopy except in non-observable areas of the time flow where =
the=20
topological configuration can changed.
