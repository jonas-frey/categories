If you take C to be the dual of the category of models of a theory in
universal algebra, and F to be the free functor (in this case F is
covariant), then you will find a lot of familiar facts. I like the
mathematics in your posting for its simplicity, and the idea of using
contravariant functors very good. Whether it rings bells in some people
or not, it is certainly a nice and worthwhile stuff just as it is, write
it for the arXiv, and may be you can publish it somewhere afterwards.

best  e.d.
