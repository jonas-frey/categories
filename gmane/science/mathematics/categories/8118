Dear George,

Thanks for your message. I should say that the locally connected topos
example was just intended to be a sample application of the modified
monadic descent theorem quoted at the start of my message. But as you
point out, one could also apply it in the setting of categorical Galois
theory that you refer to. In the terminology of [CJKP] this would say
something like:

Let I -| H : X ----> C be an admissible reflection, and p: E --> B an
effective descent map in C. Then Spl(E,p) is isomorphic to the category
of algebras for the monad

C / E --Sum_p--> C / B --H^B.I^B--> C / B --p^*--> C / E

Which decomposes into the two statements:

(1) Let I -| H : X ----> C be an admissible reflection, and p: E --> B
an effective descent map in C. Then Spl(E,p) is isomorphic to the
category of M-on-objects discrete fibrations over the kernel-pair \bar B
of p --- i.e. C^{\bar B} /\ M / {\bar B} in the terminology of [CJKP]

-- which is (part of) the Theorem on p.26 of ibid.; and

(2) Let I -| H : X ----> C be an admissible reflection, and p: E --> B
_any_ map in C. Then C^{\bar B} /\ M / {\bar B} is isomorphic to the
category of algebras for the monad

C / E --Sum_p--> C / B --H^B.I^B--> C / B --p^*--> C / E

--- and it is really this (2) which I am interested in. Does this come
up in the categorical Galois theory literature?

The other example I attempted in my original message, but botched rather
badly, involving vector bundles, was an attempt to give some application
of this modified descent theorem to a fibred monad which is not a fibred
reflection.  The categorical Galois theory example is compelling because
one has a fibred monad whose algebras do not descend along effective
descent morphisms (although, of course, the underlying objects do). The
point is that the algebras for lots of fibred monads DO descend along
effective descent morphisms, e.g., any fibred monad on a topos E ----> S
induced by a finitary algebraic theory in S. So I guess a subsidiary
question is whether there are any compelling examples of non-idempotent
fibred monads whose algebras do not descend.

Richard
