Dear Johannes,

"Point-free" is as opposed to "point-set" - there is no assumption that
the real numbers form a set. Instead, they are taken to be the models of
a (geometric) theory of Dedekind sections of the rationals (which do
form a set). More generally, a point-free space is one where the points
are defined as models of a propositional geometric theory. The topology
is then defined intrinsically, opens being the geometric propositions.

My motivation for this comes from topos theory. In any elementary topos,
each point-free space does in fact have a set (object) of points.
Topologically, it amounts to approximating bundles by local
homeomorphisms. However, that construction is not geometric - preserved
by inverse image functors, and by pullback of bundles -, so the
point-set version is not robust under change of base. There are
advantages to staying within the geometric fragment of elementary topos
logic, and I am exploring how far that can be taken. I also now have
other semantics using arithmetic universes, where the point-set versions
simply don't exist.

If it helps, the point-free real line in an elementary topos E is the
localic geometric morphism p: F -> E got from F as topos of sheaves of
the internal locale of formal reals in E. If E is an S-topos, then you
can do this generically over S to get R as the S-classifier for Dedekind
sections, and then p is just the bipullback E x_S R. A point-set R would
be some local homeomorphism over E (then equipped separately with a
topology), but in general it is not got as a bipullback of a local
homeomorphism over S.

The question about the affine real line represents a challenge to this
geometric approach, and I'd like to form a better idea of whether it is
simply a difficult problem, or a fundamental limitation to my approach.
To put it another way, am I following in Grothendieck's footsteps in the
way I think of toposes, or am I mishandling his ideas in ways that have
no bearing on what he was trying to do?

All the best,

Steve.
