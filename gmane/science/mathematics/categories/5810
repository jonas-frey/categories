rrect.  But, on the other hand, Rel is a =0Acompact closed category (also: =

n that last point is pretty tenuous...  A locally =0Apresentable category m=
ay have the property that every object =0Ais presentable, but the converse =
is false.  For example, Sup =0A(the category of complete lattices and supre=

th this line of argument: if good terminology=0Acan be found, it will kill =
off its rivals PDQ.  In fact, I =0Ahave not been able to stop myself from t=
hinking about this=0Aissue, and would like to propose "simply closed catego=
ry" as =0Aa replacement for "autonomous category" (in the sense of: =0Amono=
idal category in which every object has a left and a =0Aright dual).  The p=
oint is that such a monoidal category is =0A(both left and right) closed; m=
oreover, it is one in which =0Athe "closed structure" (i.e. the pair of int=
ernal homs) =0Aadmits an unusually simple description.  =0A=0AOne possible =
objection, aside from that which Mike has =0Aalready made, is that the word=
  "simple" already has an =0Aestablished mathematical meaning.  My rebuttal =
to this is =0Athat there are precedents for using an adverb independently =
=0Aof the corresponding adjective.  For example, I see no =0Aconnection bet=
ween the "completely" in "completely positive =0Amap" and any of the standa=
rd meanings of "complete".  =0A=0ACheers,=0AJeff.=0A=0A=0A
