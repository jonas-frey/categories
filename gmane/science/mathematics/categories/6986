You may have overlooked the scare quotes.

I agree, but I said "false," not "invalid."

This would only make sense if you identify truth and validity.
The formula is vacuously *valid* under every interpretation.

Your "have to" here brings to mind Dan Dennett's chapter "Qualia
Disqualified" in his 1991 book "Consciousness Explained."  Concerning
"if a tree falls in the forest and there is no one to hear it, does it
make a sound?", Dennett says "The answer is left as an exercise for the
reader."  Dennett appears to reject the possibility of two answers
depending on whether "sound" is considered a physioacoustic or
psychoacoustic phenomenon on the ground that it can't be the latter
since (if I understand his argument on pages 370-411) there is no
coherent notion of the latter.  (How could anyone doubt this after 40
pages?)  Dennett's argument in turn brings to mind the argument that,
since we can't pin down climate sensitivity to better than a range of
1.5 to 5 degrees per doubling of CO2, global warming can't be real.

What we have here is the logical counterpart of "no one to hear the
sound" as "no interpretation to witness the truth."  The distinction
between physioacoustic and psychoacoustic becomes that between
physio-logical and psycho-logical, truth vs. validity.

But did the tree actually fall?  Is "P(a) --> (exists) x. P(x)" (context
should make clear that those are not intended as scare quotes) actually
false as I claim?

Enter the scare quotes on "clearly," and enter Tarski pointing out that
truth can't be defined.

For this sentence it's not impossible to define truth, it's just that
there's no canonical definition, since in the empty universe the truth
of P(a) becomes an incoherent notion, leaving one at liberty to define
it however you wish.  Correct me if I've misunderstood but you
(following Mostowski?) appear to have chosen to assign "true" to every
non-closed formula, which stops the bleeding, a victory for first aid.

CCA, concrete cylindric algebras, namely subalgebras of the Boolean
algebra 2^D^V, handle all this automatically when D = 0.  When the
formula contains no variables at all, free or bound (i.e. propositional
calculus, V=0), D^V = 0^0 = 1 and B = 2 as appropriate for propositional
calculus.  That is, absent both individuals *and* variables, CCA
automatically becomes ordinary propositional calculus.

But if V is nonempty then D^V = 0 and B = 2^0 = 1, the inconsistent
Boolean algebra.

*CCA automatically recognizes the inconsistency of trying to define
truth in the empty universe when the formula contains variables.*

With CCA there is no need to staunch the bleeding because the patient
was not injured in the first place.  With other semantics, which
invariably disallow B = 1, YMMV as they say.

The version of my proof (that CCA handles this problem in stride) that I
told to Andreka and Nemeti assumed a fixed V, per the usual convention
among cylindric algebraists (whatever their radius).  Knowing how
strongly Bill feels about cylindric algebra, and anticipating that he
would surely object to my argument in that form, I tweaked it slightly
by introducing a master set X of variables so as to be completely
consistent not only with Bill's nice way of handling quantifiers, which
requires allowing V to vary, but even the most egregious ways including
those in the Cylindric Algebra volumes.  You will hopefully have noticed
that the only property of interpretations I_B that I required was that
they interpret propositional formulas (V = 0) so as to make T(L) agree
with standard propositional logic.  The proof does not depend on how
quantification is defined, and is just as sound for Bill's approach as
for anyone else's.
