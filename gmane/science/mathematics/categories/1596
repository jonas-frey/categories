Peter Freyd's constructive version of his description of (a closed interval in)
the reals as a final coalgebra, posted on this network on 31 July, in fact
constructs (a closed interval in) the Dedekind reals in any topos with NNO.
Peter's attempt to show using signed binary expansions that his construction
produces the Cantor (or Cauchy) reals doesn't work, unless you assume countable
dependent choice (in which case, of course, the Cantor reals coincide with the
Dedekind reals).

The proof has two parts. First you have to show that a closed interval in the
Dedekind reals is a coalgebra for Peter's ordered-wedge functor (for which the
structure map is an isomorphism). This is not completely trivial, because in
Peter's description of the `thick' ordered wedge

     XvY = { <x,y> | ((x < T) => (B = y)) and ((B < y) => (x = T)) }

the strict order-relation (x < y) that he uses is simply the negation of 
(y \leq x): thus, in the Dedekind reals, it is the double-negation closure of
what we usually think of as the strict order-relation. However, it doesn't
matter, because in the Dedekind reals the assertions (B = y) and (x = T) are
double-negation stable (equality being the negation of apartness), and thus the
assertions

     ((x < T) => (B = y))     and    (\neg\neg(x < T) => (B = y))

(where `<' now denotes the `real' strict order relation) have the same
truth-value for any x and y. Using this, it's easy to see that (for example)
the ordered wedge [-1,0] v [0,1] is isomorphic to [-1,1], via the maps

     <x,y> |-> x + y      and     z |-> <min(z,0),max(z,0)>  .

Note that this already tells us that the final coalgebra can't be the Cantor
reals, because if it were, then in a topos (e.g. sheaves on a locally connected
space) where the Cantor and Dedekind reals are different we would have a
retraction from Dedekind to Cantor --- which surely doesn't exist.

Now, given a coalgebra

     <d,u>: X --> XvX  ,

we have to produce a mapping from X to (say) the Dedekind interval [-1,1]. 
We do this in exactly the way that Peter tried to construct a signed binary
expansion, except that we use the output of Peter's three-state machine to
produce a pair of sets of (dyadic) rationals rather than a sequence of digits.
(The reason why it won't do the latter is its non-determinism: for any natural
number n, it will produce a nonempty set of sequences of length n, and any
sequence of length n can be extended to a sequence of length n+1, but (without
dependent choice) that's not enough to ensure that it will produce a nonempty
set of *infinite* sequences. But non-determinism doesn't matter if you're
simply trying to construct two sets of rationals: if you get positive answers
to two questions, telling you to put different rationals into your sets, you
simply obey both instructions.)

Thus the idea is that, given an element x of our coalgebra, we construct
the pair of sets <L,U> as follows: we ask the three questions

     "B < ux?"
     "B < udx and dux < T?"
     "dx < T?"

knowing that our machine will produce a positive answer to at least one of
these questions. If the answer to the first is yes, we put 0 (and all rationals
less than it) into L, if the answer to the second is yes we put -1/2 into L and
+1/2 into U, and if the third is yes we put 0 into U. Keep going in this way,
and define L and U to be the unions of the sequences of sets you construct. We
have to show that the result really is a Dedekind real, of which the only
interesting bit is showing that it satisfies the positive version

     ((q < r) => ((q \in L) or (r \in U)))

of the `zero distance apart' condition. Given q and r, we know an n such that
2^{-n} < r - q, and we know that running our machine for n+2 steps will pin
down x to an interval of length 2^{-n}. So we simply run the machine for this
length of time, and look to see where we've got to.

Of course, we also have to show that the map (f,say) defined by this procedure
is the unique coalgebra homomorphism from X to [-1,1]. But this is easy, given
that equality of Dedekind reals is a negative statement: given a (putative)
other such map g, all we have to do is assume (fx < gx) for some x \in X and
derive a contradiction. And if fx < gx, we can find a dyadic rational q which
separates them; then we run our machine until it has assured us that fx < q,
and derive a contradiction to the assumption that g is order-preserving (and
commutes with d and u).

Aside: one thing that bothered me (and, I believe, people in Edinburgh) about
Peter's construction was its use of the `negative' strict order relation: since
we know that the positive strict order on the reals is the one that really
matters, why doesn't it appear in the definition? Well, it doesn't; but you can
define it purely in terms of the coalgebra structure: x < y iff there is some
finite sequence of d's and u's that takes x to B and y to T. (Proving from
first principles that this yields a transitive relation on the final coalgebra
is an interesting exercise.)
