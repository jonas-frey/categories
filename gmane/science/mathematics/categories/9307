Okay, your argument seems sound.  But consider the following.  If Z is a 
free group, say Z = F(X), then you can show that for any Z-module M (if M 
is a pi-module a homomorphism Z --> pi makes M into a Z-module of course), 
then for either a right or a 2-sided module, it is trivial to see that 
Der(Z,M) = M^X.  That is, any function X --> M extends in a unique way to 
a derivation Z --> M.  Now resolve an arbitrary Z with G^2Z ===> GZ ---> Z 
and then we get an equalizer Der(Z,M) ---> Der(GZ,M) ===> Der(G^2Z,M) or 
Der(Z,M) ---> Der(GC,M) ===> Der(G^2Z,M) which is Der(GZ,M) ---> M^Z ===> 
M^{GZ} for whichever kind of module you have.  But, the ismorphisms are 
not natural (except with respect to maps of the basis, which G\epsilon is, 
but \epsilon G isn't) and so the two versions of Der(Z,M) may well be 
different and hence the two versions of Y.

I guess Jon didn't correctly describe the category of pi-modules.

Dear Michael,

Although the answer to your question is "Of course not!", it is a very
interesting question because it inspires very interesting questions about
internal actions in semi-abelian categories. In this message I shall,
however, only explain why is it "Of course not!" (with "!").

1. The category of pi-modules can be identified with the category of
Z[pi]-modules, where Z[pi] is the group ring over pi. Now, suppose, for
simplicity, that pi is abelian. Then you question can be stated as:

Are the rings Z[pi] and Z[pi x pi] Morita equivalent?

Of course not, because two commutative rings are Morita equivalent if and
only if they are isomorphic. Well, for some funny groups they are, but I
know you are not asking asking about funny groups.

2. Your functor from 2-sided modules to split epis is fine, but it is not an
equivalence, e.g. because your structure on Y will not allow you to recover
the pi-module structure on M from the Beck module structure on Y-->pi. In
fact one can prove the following:

Two 2-sided pi-module structures * and # on M give the same Beck modules
structures on a chosen pi-->Y-->pi if and only if

x*m*(inverse of x) = x#m#(inverse of x) for every x in pi and every m in M.

For example if we assume that both left actions are trivial, then the right
actions will have to coincide, as in Beck's theory.

Remark: but you never mention what happened after Beck - I mean Bourn
protomodularity and internal actions...

Best regards,
George
