Indeed, being a computer scientist the BHK interpretation (see
wikipedia) of logical connectives (which I can implement on a finite
machine) makes more sense to me than the idea of infinite truth tables.

You seem to think that the only alternative to excluded middle
(forall P:Prop. P \/ not P) is (exists P:Prop. not (P \/ not P))?
However, I'd say that "forall n:Nat. Halt n \/ not Halt n" is clearly
invalid in the BHK interpretation without claiming that there is a
particular statement which  will never be decided, or a Turing
machine which can be never shown to be terminating or not, i.e. even
if we accepts Church's thesis, we arrive at "not (forall n:Nat. Halt
n \/ not Halt n)" but not "exists n:Nat.not (Halt n \/ not Halt n)".

To summarize, your reasoning seems to already presupposes that we
accept Excluded Middle.

Maybe this is related to my reply?
