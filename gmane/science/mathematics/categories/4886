Yes, that's right on both counts, but see below.

As you say, if you work 1-categorically, you are stuck with undue
strictness. And as you imply, there is an impediment to a fully
2-categorical approach because of the contravariance of the internal hom.
But there is a way around this. You work 2-categorically, but not over the
2-category Cat, but over the 2-category of categories, functors, and natural
_isomorphisms_. (Kelly & co call this 2-category Cat_g, with g presumably
standing for groupoidal, since this is not just enriched in Cat but in
groupoids.) Then the internal hom does indeed become a 2-functor
Cat^2_g-->Cat_g.

Having these invertible 2-cells now allows you to consider pseudomorphisms
of algebras, which preserve structure up to isomorphism, thus alleviating
the problem of undue strictness. It doesn't completely solve it - since we
only have invertible 2-cells, we don't have a notion of lax morphism; or,
more precisely, the notion of lax morphism we get is just that of
pseudomorphism. Similarly, some constructions might not give what we hoped
for. For example, the cotensor C^2 in Cat_g is not the category of arrows in
C, it's the category of invertible arrows in C.

All the best,

Steve.
