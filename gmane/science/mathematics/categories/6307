Dear David

In a daring version of an undergraduate algebra unit on groups,
I taught the notions of cartesian and opcartesian morphism
for a functor and looked at them for the functor ob : Cat --> Set.
The goal was to give a groupoid proof of the Nielsen-Schreier
theorem using fibrations in the small (between groupoids) and in the
large. I achieved the goal to my own satisfaction; I think most of
the students thought otherwise. A core of them liked it. This is
the most explicit category theory I have tried to teach pre fourth
year honours.

My inspiration very definitely came from Ronnie Brown's topology =20
book(s).

I'm not at work today (Saturday, and a grandson's birthday party)
so I can't check whether these constructions of direct and inverse
images for ob : Cat --> Set are in that book, whether it is the
ob : Gpd --> Set  case that is there, or what. Ronnie can tell us
perhaps. Anyway, it is essentially there. It may not be phrased in
terms of cartesian morphisms.

I too would like to know of other references.

I am ashamed to say I hadn't thought about the 2-fibrational aspects
of ob : Cat --> Set.

Also, how about the Beck-B=E9nabou-Roubaud-Chevalley condition?
