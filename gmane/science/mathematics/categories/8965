FSCD 2017 Call for Workshop Proposals
(Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction, September 2017, Oxford, UK)
http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/conferences/fscd2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------

FSCD 2017, co-located with ICFP 2017, will be the second edition of
the International Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and
Deduction. The FSCD conference was created by the communities behind
two major conferences, RTA (Rewriting Techniques and Applications) and
TLCA (Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications). The first event took
place in Porto, Portugal in June 2016 and was extremely successful,
attracting 186 participants and 11 workshops.

We invite proposals for workshops, tutorials or other satellite
events, on any topic to related formal structures in computation and
deduction, from theoretical foundations to tools and applications. A
full list of suggested topics is given here:
     http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/conferences/fscd2017/cfp.html
Satellite events will take place on 7-9 September, after the main
conference on 3-6 September. It is expected that satellite events
would run for 1 or 2 days, and be open to participants of parallel
events.

PROPOSALS

Proposals should be submitted by email directly to the workshop chair
jamie.vicary@cs.ox.ac.uk, with the following information:
  * title of the satellite event, description of the topic and its
relevance to FSCD;
  * names and affiliations of the organizers;
  * pointers to information about past editions of the event, if applicable;
  * proposed event duration and format (for example, paper
presentations, tutorials, demo sessions, etc);
  * plans for invited speakers or special sessions;
  * estimate of the number of participants;
  * procedures for selecting papers and participants and plans for the
publication of proceedings, if any;
  * tentative schedule for paper submission and notification of acceptance;
  * a brief description (up to 120 words) of the event for the website
and publicity material;
  * any other special requirements.

The organizers of satellite events are expected to create and maintain
a website for the event; handle paper selection, reviewing and
acceptance; draw up a programme of talks; advertise their event though
specialist mailing lists; prepare the informal pre-proceedings (if
applicable) in a timely fashion; and arrange any post-proceedings.

The FSCD 2017 organizing committee will handle promotion of the event
on the main conference website; integration of the event's programme
into the overall timetable; registration of participants; distribution
of a USB memory stick containing the informal pre-proceedings;
arrangement of an appropriate meeting room; and provision of lunch and
coffee breaks for participants. We will waive the registration fees
for invited speakers to satellite events.

Notification of success of proposals: February 13, 2017
