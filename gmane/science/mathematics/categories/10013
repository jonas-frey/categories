Dear friends,

We're hiring.  That is, the School of Mathematics at the University of
Edinburgh is advertising permanent positions:

https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/jobs/lectureship-readership-in-algebra-geometry-topolog

Category theory is specifically mentioned as a possible subject area, and
the ad also mentions the importance of glue:

"The Hodge Institute is a large world-class group of mathematicians whose
research interests lie in Algebra, Geometry and Topology and related
fields such as Category Theory and Mathematical Physics.  Applicants
should demonstrate an outstanding research record and contribute to the
productive and strong collaborative research environment in the Hodge
Institute.  Preference may be given to candidates who strengthen
connections between different areas of research within the Hodge Institute
or more broadly between the Hodge Institute and other parts of the
School."

The Hodge Institute is just our name for the set of people within the
School who work on the subjects mentioned.

We?re advertising for Lecturers or Readers.  These are both permanent
positions.  Lecturer is where almost everyone starts their career, and
Reader is more senior (the rough equivalent of a junior full professor in
US terminology).

Best wishes,
Tom
