Dear Michael,

I have a trivial comment to the first paragraph of your message. You ask:

"...Could you have two (semi)ring structures on the same set with the same
associative multiplication?"

Take any (semi)ring R with a multiplicative automorphism f that is not an
additive automorphism, and transport the structure along f. For instance,
both in the semiring of natural numbers and in the ring of integers, any
non-identity permutation of (positive) prime numbers determines such an f.

An example for students: take, say,

f(2) = 3, f(3) = 2, and f(p) = p for all primes p different from 2 and 3.

Then, denoting the new addition by *, we calculate (usung the fact that f
coincides with its inverse)

1*1 = f(f(1)+f(1)) = f(2+2) = f(2x2) = f(2)xf(2) = 3x3 = 9.

Best regards,

George
