The question as posed makes no sense.

To begin with, there are too many groups to form a set, so you need to
pose this as a question about classes rather than sets, and f needs to
map classes instead of sets.

Second, you must first specify a larger class of which the class of all
groups is a proper subclass.  Otherwise what does it mean for x not to
be a member of A?  In this case, what does it mean not to be a group?

If you make the larger class "everything" then f has an unmanageably
large domain.  What if you apply f to an anteater, for example?
