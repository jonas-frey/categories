         Organised in conjunction with MPC'02

                  CALL FOR PAPERS

Generic programming is about making programs more 
adaptable by making them more general. Generic 
programs often embody non-traditional kinds of 
polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from 
them by suitably instantiating their parameters. 
In contrast with normal programs, the parameters 
of a generic programs are often quite rich in 
structure. For example they may be other programs, 
types or type constructors, class hierarchies, or 
even programming paradigms. 

Generic programming techniques have always been of 
interest, both to practitioners and to theoreticians, 
but only recently have generic programming 
techniques become a specific focus of research in 
the functional and object-oriented programming 
language communities. This working conference will 
bring together leading researchers in generic 
programming from around the world, and feature 
papers capturing the state of the art in this 
important emerging area. 

We welcome contributions on all aspects, theoretical 
as well as practical, of generic programming, 
aspect-oriented programming, polytypic programming, 
adaptive object-oriented programming, generic 
components, and so on.
