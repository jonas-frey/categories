The Category Theory book on
Wikibooks<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category_Theory>has been
languishing for three years, except for some good work done by
Physis <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Physis>.  I have spent the last
two days reorganizing it and cleaning it up.  I have broken the book into
pages and introduced some stubs.  I have rewritten the Introduction and most
of the chapter on Categories. The chapter on Natural Transformations covers
the topic but I recommend it be rewritten in a more labeled style with
bulleted lists, subsections, etc (like the Categories chapter)  The other
chapters need to be completely rewritten to fix the TeX, get rid of the page
references (to someone's lecture notes, presumably), and so on.

This is a good project for retired category theorists.  Younger
mathematicians get no academic rewards at all for contributing to Wikis.

Note:  If you are interested in something special, just write it up!   For
example you could write up typed lambda-calculus as an example, or a section
on sheaves, or an introduction to 2-categories.  If you need to refer to
something not yet written, just add a stub.  *Wikibooks do not have to be
done in order. *
