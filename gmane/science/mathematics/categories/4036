What is the context?  I've been using Adobe Reader 8 on Windows since it first
came out and have never seen this, very definitely including pdf files created
by pdflatex on both Windows and Linux.  As a quick check I just created a
number of pdf files in various ways on both Windows and Linux and viewed them
in both places using both Adobe Reader 7 and Adobe Reader 8 and was unable to
see any difference at all.
