Can I add to Steve's excellent summary of the situation the
observation that there are circumstances under which the
strict pullback of locally presentable categories will also
be locally presentable. I know of three such.

The first is when one of the functors being pulled back is an
isofibration: that is, a functor admitting (necessarily
cartesian) liftings of isomorphisms. In this case, it has
been observed by Joyal and Street that the strict pullback
also enjoys the universal property of the pseudopullback, and
hence is locally presentable as in Steve's message.

The second situation is when one of the functors in question
is monadic. For then the vertex of the strict pullback can be
constructed from inserters and equifiers in Acc, and hence is
accessible; moreover, it is necessarily complete (since it
projects onto a complete category via a limit-creating
functor, namely the pullback of the monadic one), and hence
locally presentable.

The third situation is when one of the functors in question
is comonadic: in which case the same argument pertains, but
with completeness now substituted by cocompleteness.

Note in particular that these last two circumstances include
the situation of pulling back a reflective or coreflective
subcategory.
