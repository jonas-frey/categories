I am sorry for posting this again, but I have received an empty message from
the categories list.


[Note from moderator: From the categories list web-page:

"Do not send attachments, html or excessively long postings (greater than
about 10K). Postings with attachments will be discarded; long postings or
ones with html may be."

The reason an empty message arrives is that the moderator sometimes
inadvertently mishandles a message containing the header:

"Content-Type: multipart/alternative; ..."

This header is associated with html and messages sent in multiple formats.
It is time-wasting to deal with such messages.

For good reasons, categories is a *text* mailing list. For example,
consider:

http://pyropus.ca/personal/writings/nomime.html

or

http://home.earthlink.net/~bobbau/email/avoiding-html/

If you want your messages to be posted on categories, please ensure that
you send only text-only posts. The URLs just quoted contain help to do
this. Other messages *will* be discarded.

Thanks. ]

Subject: Terminology problem with monoidal adjunctions
To: categories <categories@mta.ca>


Dear mathematicians,

I have a terminology problem concerning monoidal adjunctions and would
therefore like to ask some experts.

Let V and W be two symmetric monoidal categories and
L: V <--> W :R
an adjunction of (lax) symmetric monoidal functors, .i.e. the unit and the
counit are monoidal natural transformations. In a previous post, it was
pointed out to me that L have to be automatically a strong symmetric
monoidal functor then (I do not remember if the monoidal structures have to
be closed for this implication). I have read the term 'strong symmetric
monoidal adjunction' and it seems to me that this is just a monoidal
adjunction with a strong monoidal L. Why is this definition not redundant? I
have also read about a 'strict symmetric mnonoidal adjunction'. This
confuses me totally, since I have the impression that there is sometimes
inconsistency in the use of the term 'strict' and 'strong'.

Thank you for any help.
Tony
