			  Third Announcment

   Fields Institute Program on Homotopy Theory and its Applications
		    University of Western Ontario
			   London, Ontario
			   September, 2003

		   http://www.math.uwo.ca/homotopy/

During the month of September, 2003, the Department of Mathematics at
the University of Western Ontario will host a program on homotopy
theory and its applications to other areas.  Gunnar Carlsson, Paul
Goerss, Ieke Moerdijk, Jack Morava and Fabien Morel will be in
residence for parts of the month (see below).  All of the events will
take place in London, Ontario.

The focus of the month will be a special 5 day version of the Ontario
Topology Seminar, beginning on Saturday, September 20 in the morning
and ending on Wednesday, September 24 in the afternoon.  The speakers
who have agreed to come are listed below.

In addition, there will be six mini-courses at other times during
the month given by the five longer-term visitors. Each will consist of
two to three lectures. A tentative schedule is below.

The organizers are Rick Jardine <jardine@uwo.ca> and Dan Christensen
<jdc@uwo.ca>. If you think you might attend, please let one of us
know (if you haven't already).

The conference web page (see above) will be updated periodically.
Hotel and travel information is available at

  http://jdc.math.uwo.ca/directions.html

We recommend you book a hotel room right away, as the conference overlaps
with homecoming weekend at Western. (You can always cancel later.)

The conference is supported by the Fields Insitute, the NSF, and NSERC.

Mini-course schedule:

The mini-courses will be held at the University of Western Ontario.
Each course will be three hours long, either three one-hour lectures
or two 90-minute lectures, except for Carlsson's second course, which
will consist of two one-hour lectures.  Rooms, times and abstracts
will be announced later.

Sept 8, 9, 10: Morava, "Recent developments in Galois theory"
Sept 11, 12: Goerss, "Sheaves of modules and sheaves of spectra

Sept 20-24: conference
Sept 25, 26, 29: Morel, "Computation and conjectures on motivic
                         stable homotopy groups of spheres"

Here is when the minicourse speakers will be at Western:

Gunnar Carlsson: Sept 14-23.
Paul Goerss: Sept 7-13.
Ieke Moerdijk: Sept 12-24.
