This seems to be a typical story of software design. Category theory
provides a toolbox of design patterns, which can be useful before and
irrespectively to an actual formalization. Tom Maibaum and I even wrote a
paper trying to stress this aspect of CT:
Category Theory and Model-Driven Engineering: From Formal Semantics to
Design Patterns and Beyond
http://rvg.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcs/paper.cgi?ACCAT2012.1

Intuition of a healthy structure provided by CT is based on formal
foundations, but its value goes beyond formal semantics.
