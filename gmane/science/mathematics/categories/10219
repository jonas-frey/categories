Research Fellow in Proof Theory - School of Computer Science, University of=
  Birmingham, UK.

The School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham is seeking t=
o appoint up to 2 Research Fellows (postdocs) in Proof Theory, for a durati=
on of 2 years (with possibility of extension). The theory group at the Univ=
ersity of Birmingham is one of the leading groups in logical foundations of=
  computer science, with expertise not only in Proof Theory but also related=
  areas such as Type Theory, Category Theory and Mathematical Logic:

<https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/>=20

These positions are funded by a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship "StrIP: Stru=
cture vs Invariants in Proofs", led by Dr Anupam Das. The project aims to d=
evelop the theory of 'cyclic proofs' and their connections to automata theo=
ry. The principal responsibility of the fellow(s) will be to conduct resear=
ch, both collaboratively with Dr Das and other researchers at Birmingham, a=
nd independently. The fellow(s) will also be supported in career developmen=
t and encouraged to pursue independent opportunities.

Qualifications and expertise

You will have (or be close to completing) a PhD in Logic (computer science,=
  mathematics or philosophy), or equivalent qualifications. You will have an=
  excellent research record, with expertise in some of the following areas:

* Proof theory (in particular, deep inference or cyclic proofs).
* Automata theory (in particular, infinite word and tree automata).
* Mathematical logic (in particular, fragments of arithmetic or set theory)=
.

Application

Informal inquiries prior to application are encouraged and should be direct=
ed to Dr Anupam Das <a.das@bham.ac.uk>. You may find further details on the=
  positions and instructions for applying here:

Practical information

Starting salary range: =A330,942 - =A340,322 (potentially progressing to =
=A342,792).
Application deadline: 24 June 2020.
Starting date: As soon as possible, but ideally no later than October 2020.
Duration: 2 years (with possibility of extension)
