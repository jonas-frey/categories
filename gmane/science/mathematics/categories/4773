                               GaLoP IV

      4th Workshop on Games for Logic and Programming Languages

                   (satellite event of ETAPS 2009)

                     ***   CALL FOR PAPERS   ***

                        York, United Kingdom
                           28-29 March 2009

----------------------------------------------------------------------


GaLoP is an annual international workshop on game-semantic models for
logics and programming languages and their applications. This is an
informal workshop that welcomes work in progress, overviews of more
extensive work, programmatic or position papers and tutorials as well
as contributed papers. Accordingly, we ask for submission of both short
abstracts outlining what will be presented at the workshop and longer
papers describing completed work, either published or unpublished.

The fourth GaLoP will be held in York (UK) between March 28 and 29
and will be part of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and
Practice of Software (ETAPS 2009).

Contributions are invited on all pertinent subjects.

Typical (but not exclusive) areas are:

- games and categorical semantics,
- algorithmic aspects of games,
- programming languages and full abstraction,
- semantics of logics and proof systems,
- proof search,
- program verification and model checking,
- program analysis,
- theories of concurrency.

There will be no formal proceedings. In previous years, a special issue
of the Annals of Pure and Applied Logic has been produced, and this
possibility will be pursued again this year.
