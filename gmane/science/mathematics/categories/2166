CHANGE OF VENUE:

Please note that this year's meeting on Foundational Methods
in Computer Science (FMCS 2003) will be hosted by the Logic
Group at the University of Ottawa, May 30th -- June 1st.

The change in venue is to allow participants to take advantage
of the "Theoretical Computer Science Month" supported by the
Field's institute leading up to the LICS meeting in Ottawa.

It is planned to hold next years meeting in the Kananaskis
(Alberta) ..

FOUNDATIONAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

The workshop is an informal meeting to bring together researchers
in mathematics and computer science with a focus on the applications
of category theory in computer science.  It is a three day meeting,
which starts with a day of tutorials (Friday 30th May) aimed at
students and newcomers to category theory, followed by a days and a
half of research talks (Saturday, 1st June and Sunday, 2nd June).
There will be a series of invited presentations (TBA).  The remaining
research talks are solicited from the participants.

If you wish to give a talk please let us know by sending an abstract
and title to Robin Cockett or Richard Blute (see e-mail address below)
before the beginning of May.

Student participation at FMCS is particularly encouraged.  There
are limited funds to provide support for students who wish to attend
the workshop (see below).

Support for graduate students:
__________________________________________________________

We particularly encourage graduate students to attend FMCS and to
present their work.  If you wish to give a presentation at FMCS
you should send a title and a brief abstract to Robin Cockett
(robin@cpsc.ucalgary.ca).  We would like to receive these abstracts
before beginning of May so that we can arrange the schedule before
the meeting itself.

Some limited funding is available to support graduate students who
wish to attend the summer school and/or FMCS.  To apply for this money,
you should contact Richard Blute (rblute@mathstat.uottawa.ca) and
include the following information:

1) A one-page email letter stating your background as well as why you
   are interested in attending.
2) The letter should also state whether you have access to any other
   funding to attend.
3) An email letter of reference from your supervisor or an appropriate
   other person.

Preference will be given to students who wish to attend FMCS and intend
to stay to attend the Fields Summer School.  Applications should be
made as soon as possible before the beginning of March.
