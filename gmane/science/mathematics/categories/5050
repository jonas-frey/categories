The presheaf category [C^op,Set] is a co-completion of C. Its full
subcategory of limit-preserving functors is another co-completion of
C. Both are "free", but with respect to a different criterion: the
Yoneda embedding into the first one does not preserve existing
colimits, whereas into the second one it does.

In particular, the second operation is idempotent (up to equivalence
of categories) if C is already co-complete (this also follows from the
adjoint functor theorem). It would therefore qualify as a "completion"
in the sense that Mike Shulman mentioned.

Any co-complete category between these two extremes is presumably also
a (non-free) co-completion.
