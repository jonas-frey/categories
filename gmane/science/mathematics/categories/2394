The 12th International FME Symposium

Pisa, Italy - September 8-14, 2003

http://fme03.isti.cnr.it -  fme03@isti.cnr.it

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FM 2003 is the twelfth in a series of symposia organized by Formal
Methods Europe, an independent association whose aim is to stimulate
the use of, and research on, formal methods for software development.
These symposia have been notably successful in bringing together a
community of users, researchers, and developers of precise
mathematical methods for software development as well as industrial
users.

Formal methods have been controversial throughout their history, and
the realization of their full potential remains, in the eyes of many
practitioners, merely a promise. Have they been successful in
industry? If so, under which conditions? Has any progress been made
in dispelling the skepticism that surrounds them? Are they worth the
effort? Which aspects of formal methods have become so well
established in the industrial practices to loose the "formal method"
label in the meanwhile?

FM 2003 aims to answer these questions, by contributions not only
from the Formal Methods community but also from outsiders and even
from skeptical people who are most welcome to explain, document, and
motivate the source of their reluctance.

Satellite Events

FM 2003, will host 7 Workshops, 8 Tutorials and 1 Day dedicated to
the Industry besides the 3 days of the FME Symposium. Tool
demonstrations will also take place during the symposium, with the
opportunity of holding presentations for each tool.

For full details on the Symposium organization and to register please
see the web site http://fme03.isti.cnr.it, or send  your query to
fme03@isti.cnr.it.
