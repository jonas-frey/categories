Dear categorists,=0A=0Ain several places I have seen variants of the follow=
ing statement (or its dual):=0A=0AIf C is a symmetrical monoidal category a=
nd every object has a natural monoid structure (that is any map is a monoid=
  morphism) then C is cocartesian monoidal (tensor =3D sums).=0A=0AI have no=
t found any proof of the general statement. =0AIn fact the tensor product o=
f two objects has obvious maps A -> AxB <-B and for any A -> X <- B it's ea=
sy to see that there is at least one factorization AxB -> X.=0AThe problem =
is unicity. If the monoid structure on objects is unique, then that on AxB =
(and on I) has to be the usual one and unicity follows.=0A=0AQuestion: is t=
he statement true in the above general form or one has to assume that the m=
onoid structure on objects is unique? Or that it is commutative?=0A=0AI wou=
ld be grateful for any suggestion or reference.=0A=0AClaudio=0A=0A
