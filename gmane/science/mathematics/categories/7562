Preliminary thoughts:

1. Certainly for any category C and any set of morphisms in it you can freel=
y freely adjoin splittings for all those morphisms. In particular you might s=
tart with the set of all epis in C. (They're going to become epi anyway.)

This construction is just universal algebra, but the universal algebra dooen=
't answer questions like (a) Is the functor from C faithful? (b) Does the ne=
w category inherit nice properties of C? (c) Do all epis split in the new ca=
tegory?

2. Suppose you are willing to restrict to categories with finite colimits. T=
hen epis can be characterized equationally, so there is a cartesian theory o=
f finite colimit categories in which every epi has a chosen splitting. Then t=
he forgetful functor from such categories to finite colimit categories has a=
  left adjoint. You can extend this to deal with categories with additional s=
tructure on top of the finite colimits, so long as the additional structure c=
an be expressed as cartesian theory.

Happy New Year,

Steve.
