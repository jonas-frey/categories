There has been some 'work in progress' at Bangor on this very question
for the past 8 years. This is intended to present a categorical approach
to graph theory to workers in combinatorics, and is not intended for
category theorists.  The current draft, 06.04, is available at

http://www.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/public/mathematics/research/preprints/06/
(follow the link 06.04 to 06_04.pdf).

We do indeed discuss two types of loop, which we call 'loops' and 'bands'.

Ronnie is away today, but may well add his own comment tomorrow.

Best wishes, Chris Wensley
