Dear Jean,

Thank you for your reply, but I'm afraid I do not understand your
first paragraph. The condition I'm interested in is self-dual, but the
notion of locally fully faithful functors is not. For instance, the
projection from a coslice category to its base is not locally fully
faithful. It is an interesting suggestion though. This seems to be the
correct version:

* U : C -> D is a functor such that, for every object A in C, the
induced functor A/C -> UA/D is locally fully faithful.

Thus one might say "colocally locally fully faithful". Expanding the
definitions a bit, this reduces to the condition on "categories of
factorisations" that Steve Lack mentioned in his reply.

If I am not mistaken, locally fully faithful functors are in
particular colocally locally fully faithful. Thus, by what you said in
the following paragraphs, discrete fibrations (resp. discrete
opfibrations) are examples of colocally locally fully faithful
functors generalising the projection from a slice (resp. coslice)
category to its base. This may be useful for transporting (weakly)
orthogonal factorisation systems.

Best wishes,
