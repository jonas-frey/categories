thanks for the interesting information; you really pinpoint why subtypes
are used in practice, namely for avoiding partial functions; if one wants
to avoid subtypes and treat partial functions directly one might use the
Fourman/Scott variant of the interpretation of topos logic; an alternative
and actually the one common in mathematical practice is to introduce subtypes;
however, to do this constructively one is forced to either treat partial functions
as single-valued realtions OR to explicitly introduce proof objects as in Martin-Loef
type theory; I am pretty certain that in systems like HA_\omega one cannot quantify
over partial functions as these subsume prediacte types;
but if one has Higher Order Logic already it seems more natural to treat partial functions
as single valued relations; quantification over subtypes can then be reduced to pure Higher
Order Logic via a straightforward translation (which, however, needs some care as one sees
from HOL)
