Indeed!  It's a pity that the proceedings of the main international
conference on category theory is going to be buried in this journal.

Why not publish it in TAC?

Is that still true?  If so, that's terrible.  Even most Reed-Elsevier
journals allow you to keep your papers on your own website - and more
importantly, on the mathematics arXiv.

However, Reed-Elsevier only officially accepted these practices recently.
Before that, it worked like this: if you demanded the right to keep your
paper on the arXiv, they'd give in and let you do it.  I think they were
trying to avoid public battles, to keep from looking bad.

So, if anybody feels compelled to publish in a Springer/Kluwer/Reed-Elsevier
journal for some reason, they should simply refuse to give away the
complete electronic rights to their papers.  If necessary, amend the copyright
form to say you have the right to keep your article on your website and
the arXiv.  Journals are unlikely to turn away papers for this reason
after they've already been accepted for publication.

You can read the copyright transfer forms for some math journals here:

and many more here:

Unfortunately, the information about Springer seems a bit contradictory.
