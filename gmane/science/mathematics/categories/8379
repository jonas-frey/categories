As Claudio has said, inverse image functors always preserve the NNO,
but David's question was: when does the direct image f_* preserve
the NNO? A sufficient condition for this which is weaker than being
local is that f should be connected, i.e. that f^* should be full
and faithful, since then the unit map N -> f_*f^*N is an isomorphism.
But this is certainly not necessary: for example, the inclusion from
sheaves to presheaves on any locally connected internal site in a
topos preserves N (see C3.3.10 in the Elephant). I don't know any
necessary and sufficient condition (other than the condition that
f_* preserves N!); if you restrict to countably cocomplete toposes
(where N is always a countable copower of 1), then f_* preserves N
iff it preserves all countable coproducts, iff f^* is full and faithful
on morphisms with codomain N. But it's not clear to me what significance
this latter condition has.
