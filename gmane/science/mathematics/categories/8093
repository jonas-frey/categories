Dear colleagues,

Every week, I receive an invitation "from one of you" to join ResearchGate,
whatever this is.
And some of you may receive invitations "from me". I have been ignoring
these e-mails,
but am getting more and more annoyed. There are some people out there
building up a
data base, which they will next sell to interested parties, such as
commercial publishers.

What they are doing is probably illegal, in the sense that, for example,
they are claiming to
write "on Joyal's behalf" in the case copied below. I believe we should do
something about
this. Do we have a legal expert in our midst? Are we going to claim our
share when they sell?

I'd be interested to hear your opinions.

Ieke.
