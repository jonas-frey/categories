Here are some historical notes, in complement to Pradines' comments on=20
multiplicative graphs and on quotient categories.

Charles Ehresmann introduced multiplicative graphs as an algebraic support=
=20
to the notion of a "category kernel", which corresponds to the structure=20
induced on an open subset of a topological category (in the sense of=20
Charles, i.e. a category internal to Top). Such category kernels generalize=
=20
group kernels (that Charles used in the second part of his thesis to define=
=20
locally homogeneous spaces); we had considered  them in the early sixties=20
both in his papers on differential geometry and in mine on optimization=20
problems. Then multiplicative graphs appeared as a natural tool in his=20
study on quotient categories.

Charles came to quotient categories by his works on foliations and on=20
prolongations of manifolds. In his long 1962 paper on foliations (1), he=20
constructs several kinds of holonomy groupoids by a quotient process. In=20
his paper on topological categories (2), he construct categories of jets=20
(local jets and infinitesimal jets) as quotient categories of the category=
=20
of local sections of a topological category. In fact he had exposed these=20
constructions much earlier in his lectures and briefly alluded to in his=20
papers on differential geometry in the late fifties.

So he was naturally led to a more formal study of quotients, which he began=
=20
in his paper "Structures quotient" (3), where in particular he introduces=20
the "strict quotient"; this paper (abstracted in (4)) is more easily read=20
than later papers. In a comment I have added to this paper in the "Oeuvres"=
=20
(comment 170, p. 375) I mentioned other authors who have studied quotient=20
categories about the same time, in particular Dedeckerand Mersch, Higgins,=
=20
Hoenke, P=FCmplun.

Later on, Charles tried to develop a non-abelian cohomology for which he=20
wanted to define a natural notion of "short sequence" in Cat. For this he=20
needed to define quotients of a category or of a groupoid by a=20
sub-category. It is done in the paper (5). The main results of this paper=20
are taken back in his book "Categories et Structures" (Dunod 1965), with=20
some illustrative diagrams (it is to this book that Pradines refers).
In several papers, he generalized the theory of quotient categories in the=
=20
frame of internal categories (cf. "Oeuvres", Parts III and IV), .
