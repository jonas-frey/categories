When the 100th PSSL meeting was held in Cambridge last year, I made
public the (almost) complete list of speakers and titles of talks at
PSSL meetings, which I've been keeping since they started. A number
of people suggested that it would be interesting to have a similar
list for the summer CT meetings. I'm afraid that compiling a full
list of speakers at such meetings would be beyond my resources, but
I thought it might be of interest to make a list of the dates and
locations of the meetings. So here is my first attempt at compiling
it; it's in the form of a plain TeX document, but should be easily
readable as text. At present it begins with the first Isle of Thorns
meeting in 1974, simply because that was the first such meeting that
I attended; information on earlier meetings, and corrections to the
information below, are very welcome.

\centerline{\bf Category Theory Summer Conferences}

\bigskip
The following is intended to be a list of (mostly week-long) international
conferences organized by, and attended mainly or exclusively by,
category-theorists during the (northern) summer months (which I have
interpreted broadly as June to September, inclusive). Dates quoted are
arrival and departure dates: in most cases there were no lectures on the
arrival date, and in some there were none on the departure date. Unless
otherwise indicated, the official topic of the meeting was simply
`Category Theory' or something equivalent; the meetings with other
subjects are included because they were attended by a large proportion of
`the usual suspects'. For meetings organized under the aegis of a body not
solely devoted to category theory (MFI Oberwolfach, the London
Mathematical Society, MSRI etc.) the meeting venue is shown in square
brackets.
