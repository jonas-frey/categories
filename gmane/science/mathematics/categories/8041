******************************************************************

Applications are invited for PhD study under the supervision of Dr Ross =
Duncan on any topic relating to quantum computation and category theory. =
The position is fully funded (fees and maintenance of GBP 14400 per =
year) for EU students (apologies to non EU-citizens for this ridiculous =
piece of non-meritocracy) and will last for 3 years.  The position will =
start in October 2014.

The successful candidate will be interested in both the mathematical =
foundations of quantum theory and the formal computational aspects.  Of =
particular interest are: monoidal categories, foundations of quantum =
computing, quantum simulation, graphical languages, and quantum =
programming language design.  Prior exposure to some these areas is an =
advantage, but enthusiasm and open-mindedness is more important.

The Mathematically Structured Programming Group's vision is to use =
mathematics to understand the nature of computation, and to then turn =
that understanding into the next generation of programming languages. =
This reflects the symbiotic relationship between mathematics, =
programming, and the design of programming languages =97 any attempt to =
sever this connection will diminish each component. In order to achieve =
these research goals we mainly use ideas from category theory, type =
theory and functional programming. Besides Dr Ross Duncan, the group =
consists of a number of internationally leading researchers including =
Prof Neil Ghani, Dr Conor McBride, Dr Clemens Kupke,  Dr Fredrik =
Nordvall Forsberg and a number of PhD students.

Anyone interested should in the first instance contact Ross Duncan =
(ross.duncan@strath.ac.uk) and outline their academic background. =
Applications will be considered on a first come, first served basis.
