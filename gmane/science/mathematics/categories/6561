Second Call For Participation

Types, Semantics and Verification
10th Annual Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS 2011)
University of Oregon, Eugene. June 16  - July 1, 2011
http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Activities/summerschool/

=> Registration Deadline: March 4, 2011

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The focus of this summer school is the mix or interplay of theory and
practice in program verification. The main aim is to enable
participants to conduct research in the area, thereby contributing to
improve software quality.

The Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) has been held
at the University of Oregon each summer since 2002. This year, in the
occasion of the tenth anniversary of the summer school, two plenary
lectures will complement the technical program.

Registration

Full information on registration are available at:
http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Activities/summerschool/

Registration Deadline: March 4, 2011

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some further activities will complement the main program.

Coq-labs:
Some of the lectures will assume interactive sessions using the
interactive proof assistant Coq. Students are encouraged to bring a
laptop on which Coq has been installed, and to form small working
group during the interactive sessions. Moreover, some Coq-labs will be
offered in order to give the participants the opportunity of make more
practice in using Coq.

Student Sessions:
Interested students will have the opportunity to present their work
during special sessions. Each presentation will consist of a brief
talk about the student research interests and results. These sessions
will be an occasion for students to obtain useful feedback on their
work by other students and researchers, and also to interact with
participants having similar research interests.

We hope to see you in Eugene.
