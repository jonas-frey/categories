  > Is there an analogous version for Galois theory?

In SGA 1 A.G. shows an equivalence

                      C ~= GpoidActions(\pi(C))

where C is a category with certain axioms  (that he callls Galoisiene) and

       \pi(C) is the fundamental groupoid of C (its objects are the set I of
fiber functors of C, and its vertice groups are profinite, discrete only in
case of existence of universal covering),

   and  GpoidActions(\pi(C)) is the category of families indexed by I with an
action of \pi(C).

This includes as examples both the case of covering spaces  and classical
Galois Theory (Artin theory with the algebraic closure)

I imagine that the category GpoidActions(\pi(C)) should be equivalent to
GpdCov(\pi X) in a general  abstract setting.

Subsequently, this theory was extended and generalized in a well determined
direction (progroupoids, localic groupoids, localic progroupoids) in several
steps by A.G. himself, Moerdiejk, Bunge, Dubuc and Joyal-Tierney.

Other authors extended the basic theory (presence of universal covering and
discrete groups) in different directions.
