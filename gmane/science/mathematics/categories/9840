Sixth Workshop on Natural Language and Computer Science

NLCS '19
May 24, 2019
Gothenburg, Sweden
http://www.indiana.edu/~iulg/nlcs.html

A workshop affiliated with the 13th International Conference on
Computational Semantics (IWCS 2019)
https://sites.google.com/view/iwcs2019/
Endorsed by the Association for Computational Linguistics Special Interest
Group on Computational Semantics.


AIMS AND SCOPE
Formal tools coming from logic and category theory are important in both
natural language semantics and in computational semantics. Moreover, work
on these tools borrows heavily from all areas of theoretical computer
science. In the other direction, applications having to do with natural
language has inspired developments on the formal side. The workshop invites
papers on both topics. Specific topics includes, but are not limited to:

* logic for semantics of lexical items, sentences, discourse and dialog
* continuations in natural language semantics
* formal tools in textual inference, such as logics for natural language
inference
* applications of category theory in semantics
* linear logic in semantics
* formal approaches to unifying data-driven and declarative approaches to
semantics
