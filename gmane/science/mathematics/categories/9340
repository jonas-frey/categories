Dear John,  and category theorists,=0A=
=0A=
The fact that every category has an opposite introduces =0A=
a symmetry in mathematics that would not be there otherwise. =0A=
The category of sets is not self dual, but a disjoint union of sets =0A=
is a coproduct, dual to a product.  =0A=
=0A=
Thurston does not show esteem for logic.=0A=
Most mathematicians are taking logic for granted; they just use it =0A=
as a part of their natural language. =0A=
It is obvious that human understanding depends on the =0A=
the laws of thought, on logic. =0A=
In a sense, category theory is a branch of mathematical logic,=0A=
since it greatly improves mathematical thinking in general.=0A=
A category theorist might say (not too loudly) that mathematical logic=0A=
is a branch of category theory.=0A=

Since "nauseous" means "causing nausea", perhaps Thurston's remark=0A=
had just sickened the audience.=0A=

Now here is someone well-attuned to these subtleties of English!=0A=
=0A=
I've always been delighted by opposite categories.  Sometimes I think=0A=
we live in one.  For example: if you flip forward in a book you=0A=
eventually reach the back, but if you go back far enough you reach=0A=
the foreword... and in the ancient past everything was younger.=0A=
=0A=
I always tell my students that since category theory reduces all of=0A=
mathematics=0A=
to the study of arrows, and the only mistake you can make with an arrow is=
=0A=
to get confused about which way it's pointing, they should expect to spend=
=0A=
many hours confused about exactly this.=0A=
