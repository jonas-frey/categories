This is to announce that the International Category Theory Meeting, =
initially planned
for the week 21-27 June 2020, tentatively postponed to September 2020, =
is definitely cancelled due to the international emergency for Covid-19.

But with the hope that the situation will improve, we shall organize the =
International Category Theory Conference 2021 in the same location: it =
will take place in Genoa (Italy), from Sunday, 27 June, to Saturday, 3 =
July, 2021, at DIMA, via Dodecaneso 35.

All the members of the Scientific Committee of CT2020 have agreed to act =
also for that conference, and we are grateful to all the invited =
speakers for CT2020 who have accepted to keep their commitment.

Contributions in all aspects of Category Theory are welcome and we =
especially encourage researchers to submit works on its applications as =
well as on its foundations. All talks will be held at DIMA.
