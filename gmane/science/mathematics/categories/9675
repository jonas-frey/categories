Dear Colleagues,

It is our pleasure to announce the school and conference "Aspects of =
higher representation theory: quantum groups and categorification=E2=80=9D=
  which will take place at the U-residence (campus of VUB/ULB in =
Brussels) from January 21 until January 25.

The goal of this event is to connect different communities around =
'Higher representation theory' in the broad sense (tensor categories and =
module categories, 2-categories, categorification, =E2=80=A6)

The first two days (Monday-Tuesday) of the event is a =E2=80=9Cschool=E2=80=
=9D consisting of 3 mini-courses that will introduce young participants =
and other interested researchers to the topics of the conference. During =
these days we also plan a poster session and short talks, to allow young =
researchers to communicate their results.

The next three days (Wednesday-Thursday-Friday) of the event is a =
conference, with lectures of the invited speakers in the morning and =
contributed talks in the afternoon.

Everyone is warmly invited to participate at both or one of these =
events. More information and a registration form can be found at the =
following website:
http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~hopfalgb/Aspects

The deadline for registration is November 1, 2018.

Feel free to forward this information to anyone who might be interested.
