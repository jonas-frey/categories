I don't have a specific reference in 2-category language but the following 
should be relevant:

The notion of a homotopy theory for groupoids was set up in my 1968 topology 
book now revised and republished as Topology and Groupoids. In particular
\pi_1: spaces \to groupoids preserves homotopies. Fibrations were introduced 
in an exercise, and developed in later editions. See also Philip Higgins' 
Categories and Groupoids, (1971) now available as a TAC reprint. The nerve 
and classifying space of a groupoid are in Graeme Segal's `Classifying 
spaces and spectral sequences' (IHES) utilising Grothendieck's nerve of a 
category. These preserve homotopy. The fact that for a CW-complex X, [X,BG] 
\cong [\pi_1 X, G] is also well known: P.Olum Ann Math 1958?

There is also relevant material in Gabriel-Zisman's book, but I do not have 
it with me.

People should also look at 2 papers on groupoids by P A Smith in the Annals, 
1951.

Hope that helps.
