Call for Papers:

International Workshop on Graph Transformation and Visual Modeling
Techniques

http://www.upb.de/cs/ag-engels/GT-VMT04/

A satellite of ETAPS, March 27 - 28 2004, Barcelona, Spain
supported by the SegraVis resarch training network

http://www.segravis.org

Scope and Objectives

Effective applications of visual modelling techniques require tool
support at a semantic level, e.g., for model analysis, transformation,
and consistency management. Due to the variety of languages and methods
used in different domains, an engineering approach is required which
allows for the generation of such tools from high-level specifications.

Graph transformations provide means to specify, at a conceptual level,
complex operations on diagrams. Complementing this by techniques like

    * meta modelling (including OCL)
    * compiler construction
    * logic and algebraic semantics

the workshop aims to bring together researchers from different
communities to discuss their respective contributions to different
aspects of modelling and modelling languages, like

    * syntax and well-formedness,
    * static and dynamic semantics,
    * analysis and verification,
    * refinement and transformations, and
    * integration and consistency of models.

History

This workshop is the third in the series of GT-VMT workshops:

    * GT-VMT 2000 in Geneva (Switzerland) at ICALP'00.
    * GT-VMT 2001 on Crete (Greece) at ICALP'01.
    * GT-VMT 2002 in Barcelona (Spain) at ICGT 2002.

Program Committee

The PC consist of members of the graph transformation community and
external experts for complementary techniques and application areas.

    * Jan Aagedal (Norway)
    * Luciano Baresi (Italy)
    * Andrea Corradini (Italy)
    * Jose Fiadeiro (UK)
    * Martin Gogolla (Germany)
    * Martin Gro=DFe-Rhode (Germany)
    * Reiko Heckel (Germany) [chair]
    * Uwe Kastens (Germany)
    * Joost Kok (The Netherlands)
    * Mark Minas (Germany)
    * Andy Sch=FCrr (Germany)

Submission

Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of 5 to 10 pages in
ENTCS format until December 19, 2003 electronically via our submission
web form (to be published here in due time). The contributions should
report about ongoing research in the areas of graph transformation and
visual modeling techniques according to the scope and objectives of the
workshop. Position papers and contributions making methodological
statements are strongly encouraged.

Accepted contributions will appear in an issue of Elsevier's Electronic
Notes in Theoretical Computer Science. A preliminary version of the
issue will be available at the workshop.
