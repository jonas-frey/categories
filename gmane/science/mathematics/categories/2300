You see: even with just aesthetic and software engineering
considerations you are eventually lead to topos logic...

Hi Randy,

| Perhaps more usefully, how do you suggest I do this task of developing HOL
| without description operators.

You might find it interesting to look at HOL Light. This gives a
different axiomatization of the HOL logic, developed precisely because I
was dissatisfied with the one in the original HOL system, on which I
believe the Isabelle/HOL logic is based.

Although I do eventually introduce the description operator, quite a lot
of the basic logic --- including the automation of inductive definitions
--- is developed without it (and indeed without excluded middle or
extensionality). You may find it a more congenial starting-point.

As Konrad Slind later pointed out, what I settled on is remarkably close
to the internal logic of a topos, as presented for example in Lambek and
Scott's book. This was a surprise to me since at that time I knew next to
nothing about toposes and was motivated by a mixture of aesthetic and
software engineering considerations.

Cheers,

John.
