Dear Fellow Categorists:

	I am personally not likely to take up Harvey Friedman's challenge, 
having long been doing "category theory as algebra" rather than "category
theory as foundations".

	I would like to point out, though that Friedman has deliberately chosen
as a test case real analysis, a subject which exists only to simulate the
existence of fluxions on the basis of foundations tied to two-valued logic.
How about asking Friedman to give an elegant, elementary foundation for
rings satisfying the Kock-Lawvere axioms?

	The use of an axiom schema in which arbitrarily complex formulae 
may be subsituted also seems a bit of a dodge.  At first glance, elementary
topoi plus  NNO, well-pointed and choice still doesn't need such things
(but I could be wrong, not having thought much about it for years).

Best Thoughts,
David Yetter
