Oggetto: [CSP] Petition: Boole's House at Grenville Place
Data: Mon, 01 Nov 2010 19:05:54 +0000
Mittente: Barry O'Sullivan <b.osullivan@cs.ucc.ie>
A: constraints@yahoogroups.com, csp@carlit.toulouse.inra.fr

Colleagues,

First, I would like to apologise to those who receive this
message more than once.

Now to the point:

Earlier this month George Boole's house on Grenville Place
in Cork - where he wrote "An Investigation of the Laws of Thought"
in 1854 - suffered severe damage. I've established a petition to
seek support for any initiatives that can be undertaken to
repair/restore the building urgently. The purpose of the petition
is to help decision makers in this matter gauge the strength of
support for repairing this building. This is particularly important
in the context of a weak economy in which finance for projects like
this can be difficult to find.

It would be wonderful if it were possible to restore the house
to the point where it could be the site of a museum to George
Boole and his work.

Signing the petition takes a matter of seconds.

To sign, please visit:

http://www.4c.ucc.ie/aiai/

Click the 'Boole Petition' tab and then click on the link
"Click here to sign petition" which is after the statement,
immediately above the list of signatories.

If you prefer to use a short-cut:

http://4c110.ucc.ie/aiai/boole-petition

Please circulate this message to your colleagues and friends locally,
nationally and internationally.

The petition is hosted on the web-site of the Artificial
Intelligence Association of Ireland which is, in turn, hosted
at 4C in UCC.

Finally, I'd like to thank David Devlin, PhD Student at 4C, for
his excellent help with setting up the web-site.

Kindest regards,

Barry O'Sullivan
