Dear all

I=E2=80=99ve had reason to think about locally internal categories/locally
small fibrations over a base topos lately, and I was asked to what
extent one can view these as categories of families of objects of a
=E2=80=9Clocally small category=E2=80=9D in a structural axiomatic set theo=
ry. To me
it seems like one should take the fibration to be a stack, since given
compatible families of objects on some cover, then one should
definitely be able to glue them. Maybe I=E2=80=99m looking in the wrong
places, but I don=E2=80=99t see any statements to this effect in the variou=
s
papers on locally internal categories (in all their various guises and
names), by Penon, B=C3=A9nabou, Par=C3=A9=E2=80=93Schumacher the Baby Eleph=
ant, and The
Elephant (to name a few). I didn=E2=80=99t read them thoroughly, but I also
didn=E2=80=99t see it in Mike Shulman=E2=80=99s Sets for category theory or=
  Enriched
indexed categories.

Does anyone else concur, or know of a result in the literature close to thi=
s?

Regards,
David
