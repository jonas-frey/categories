                           Call for Papers

              Compositional Verification of UML Models
                Workshop of the UML 2003 Conference


The definition  of UML has been  motivated by the need  for a standard
notation  for   modelling  system  architectures   and  behaviours  at
functional  and  implementation  level.   The  main  fqocus  has  been
essentially  on terminology,  notation and  syntax  without addressing
semantic, validation  and methodology  issues which are  important for
formal design and verification techniques. This workshop addresses the
application  of  formal  methods   and  techniques  that  exploit  the
architectural  structure  of UML  models  in  a compositional  manner.

TOPICS
The  workshop topics  include  (but  are  not limited  to):
* semantic  foundations  of  architectural  and component-based  design
within UML
* compositional techniques  for the analysis  embedded and real-time
systems  in  UML
* compositional model  checking  of  UML behavioural models
* compositional deductive  methods based on  OCL
* methodologies based on compositional formal techniques

FORMAT OF THE WORKSHOP
The  workshop will consist  of presentations  of the  accepted papers,
which will  be the basis for  an intensive discussion  on the workshop
topics.   Extended abstracts  of the  presentations will  be published
after the workshop  by Elsevier Science as a  volume of the Electronic
Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.

For an up-to-date program and  invited talks see the workshop web-site
http://fmco.liacs.nl/compuml.html

SUBMISSIONS
Authors are invited to submit  by August 25th an extended abstract not
exceeding 20  pages electronically to  F.S.de.Boer@cwi.nl. Submissions
must be either  in Postscript or PDF format  and prepared for USLetter
or A4 page sizes.

Submissions will  be evaluated by the program  committee for inclusion
in the  proceedings, which  will be published  by Electronic  Notes in
Theoretical  Computer  Science series.  Papers  must contain  original
contributions, be  clearly written, and  include appropriate reference
to and comparison with related work. Simultaneous submissions to other
conferences are not allowed.
