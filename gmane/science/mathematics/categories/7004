I think a source of confusion in this debate is the idea that there is
a single FOL.

Surely we should speak of FOL(Sigma), where Sigma is a signature i.e.
a collection of function symbols and predicate symbols, each with an
arity.

If P is a unary predicate in Sigma, then

(for all x. P(x)) => (exists x. P(x))

is a theorem of FOL(Sigma) iff Sigma contains at least one constant
(nullary function symbol).

That is for single-sorted predicate logic.  More generally, given a
set S of "sorts", we can take Sigma to be an S-sorted signature
(meaning that each function symbol has a sort, and each position
within each arity has a sort).   If P is a predicate in Sigma with one
argument of sort A, then

(for all x:A. P(x)) => (exists x:A. P(x))

is a theorem of FOL(Sigma) iff there is at least one closed term of
sort A built from the function symbols of Sigma.  For example, if
Sigma contains a constant of sort A.

I think the multi-sorted setting makes the whole issue clearer,
because it's perfectly natural and indeed useful to have a variety of
sorts of which some are empty and some are not.

Paul
