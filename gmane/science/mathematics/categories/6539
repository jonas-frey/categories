-- SCOPE --

CALCO-Tools 2011 Workshop is dedicated to tools based on algebraic and/or
coalgebraic principles or that are emerging from the intersection of
the two approaches. These include systems/prototypes/tools developed
specifically for design, checking, execution, and verification of (co)
algebraic specifications, but also tools targeting different application
domains while making core or interesting use of (co)algebraic techniques.

The previus CALCO-Tools editions, Bergen (Norway, 2007) and Udine (Italy,
2009),  took place in the day preceding the main CALCO conference.
This year, CALCO-Tools 2011 will take place on the same dates as the main
CALCO conference, with no overlap between the technical programmes of the
two events. In this way we achieve the goal of bringing together
researchers and practitioners.

-- TOPICS OF INTEREST --

We invite submissions of papers that are presenting systems/prototypes/tools
on topics included or related to those listed for the main CALCO conference:

  * Abstract models and logics
    - Automata and languages
    - Categorical semantics
    - Modal logics
    - Relational systems
    - Graph transformation
    - Term rewriting
    - Adhesive categories

  * Specialised models and calculi
    - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems
    - Calculi and models of concurrent, distributed, mobile, and
      context-aware computing
    - General systems theory and computational models (chemical,
      biological, etc)

  * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
    - Abstract data types
    - Inductive and coinductive methods
    - Re-engineering techniques (program transformation)
    - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
    - Semantics of programming languages

  * System specification and verification
    - Algebraic and coalgebraic specification
    - Formal testing and quality assurance
    - Validation and verification
    - Generative programming and model-driven development
    - Models, correctness and (re)configuration of
      hardware/middleware/architectures,
    - Process algebra


-- SUBMISSION GUIDELINES --

Tool submissions should not exceed 5 pages in LNCS format specified by
Springer (see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). It is
recommended that submissions adhere to that format and
length. As with previous editions, the accepted tool papers will be
included in the final proceedings of the conference published in the
Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.
The tools should be made available on the web at the time of submission.



-- IMPORTANT DATES --

 		Paper submission:	March 23, 2011
 		Author notification:	April 20, 2011
 		Final version due:	May 18, 2011


-- PROGRAMME COMMITTEE --

Paolo Baldan, University of Padova, IT
Luis Barbosa, Universidade do Minho, PT
Dorel Lucanu (chair), Al. I. Cuza University of Iasi, RO

-- ORGANISING COMMITTEE --

Corina Cirstea (University of Southampton, UK)
Dirk Pattinson (Imperial College London, UK)
Toby Wilkinson (University of Southampton, UK)

-- LOCATION --

Winchester is a beautiful historic city in southern England, known for
its 11th-century cathedral and 12th-century castle. It is located just
under an hour by rail from London Waterloo, and 15 minutes by road or
rail from Southampton Airport. London Heathrow is 50 miles away and
London Gatwick 72 miles away.

-- FURTHER INFORMATION --

Queries related to submission, reviewing, and programme should be sent
to the PC chair.

Queries related to the organisation should be emailed to
calco2011@ecs.soton.ac.uk
