Dear George,=20

As i mentioned in my mail, it took me many years to develop foliated =
categories AND cartesian functors to their full extent. The very first =
approach starts circa 1984 when I had proved important results on =
cartesian functors between fibered categories and started wondering =
about possible generalizations.
Thank you for sending me the paper of Cassidy, Herbert and Kelly which I =
do not know. I shall look at it carefully, but I doubt very much that it =
will have ANYTHING to do with foliated categories, let alone cartesian =
functors which are the essential content of my mail.
I shall explain why after I have read the paper you are sending me.

Best regards to all,
Jean
