BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

EWSCS is a series of regional-scope international winter schools held
annually in Estonia. EWSCS are organized by Institute of Cybernetics,
a research institute of Tallinn University of Technology.

The main objective of EWSCS is to expose Estonian, Baltic, and Nordic
graduate students in computer science (but also interested students
from elsewhere) to frontline research topics usually not covered
within the regular curricula. The working language of the schools is
English.

EWSCS'10 is the fifteenth event of the series.


PROGRAMME

The schools' scientific programme consists of short courses by
renowned specialists and a student session.

Courses of EWSCS'10

    * Robin Cockett (University of Calgary, Canada):
      Categories and Computability

    * Jens Groth (University College London, UK):
      Pairing-Based Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs

    * Aggelos Kiayias (University of Connecticut, USA):
      Encryption Mechanisms for Digital Content Distribution

    * Carroll Morgan (University of New South Wales, Australia):
      Security, Probability and Abstraction: =

      Rigorous Methods for Source-Level Reasoning =


    * Alan Mycroft (University of Cambridge, UK):
      Type-Like Frameworks for Controlling State and Aliasing

The purpose of the student session is to give students an opportunity
to present their work (typically, thesis work) and get
feedback. Registrants are invited to propose short talks (20 min) on
topics of theoretical computer science, broadly understood. The
selection will be based on abstracts of 150-400 words.

The social programme consists of an excursion and a conference dinner.
