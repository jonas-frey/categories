Mathematicians:

Below is an advertisement for Postgraduate Fellowships in memory of 
Scott Russell Johnson.

I should explain what the ad really means.  For those people without 
permanent residency in Australia, Macquarie University charges fees 
in the order of $16000 per year for enrolment in a PhD program. 
There are a few scholarships at Macquarie available to cover those 
fees but the rules for those (and the conventions followed by the 
committee) make it hard for a standard good student with an excellent 
undergraduate record (or even with a Masters degree) to get one.

For a person with permanent residency and a good record (equivalent 
of First Class Honours in our system), there are generally enough 
Australian Postgraduate Awards (APAs) to go around. An APA pays a 
living allowance of around $17000 per year tax free (it lasts 3 years 
subject to performance and is rarely extended much beyond that).

What we are trying to do with the SRJ Memorial Scholarship is two-fold:
	(1) given that an overseas student has paid the Macquarie 
fees, this Scholarship will provide $15000 towards a living allowance;
	(2) for Australian students, this Scholarship will supplement 
the APA with an extra $5000 per annum.
We cannot afford very many of these scholarships at one time, so they 
are competitive.

All postgraduate students are able to get a little extra from 
tutoring or assignment marking. Overseas students may also be able to 
obtain a supplement of around $3000 per annum from our Department.

Regards,
Ross

  Scott Russell Johnson Memorial Scholarships for PhD Research
 
Applications are invited for Scott Russell Johnson Memorial 
Scholarships which are offered for full-time PhD  studies in the 
Centre of Australian Category Theory (CoACT) at Macquarie University.
 
Applicants should hold or expect to obtain a First class Bachelor 
Honours degree (or equivalent) in an appropriate field, and be 
eligible for admission to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the 
Division of Information and Communication Sciences in the area of 
Mathematics.

The award will be made to the best qualified applicants on the basis 
of academic merit.
 
The full Scholarship provides a living allowance of $15,000 per annum 
tax exempt.  A supplementary scholarship, up to the maximum allowed, 
may be awarded to students  who already hold an APA or MUPGRA; see
<http://www.mq.edu.au/postgrad/schl/2000apasinfo.pdf >.
The full scholarship may  not be held concurrently with any other 
equivalent scholarship, and the Scholarship holder will be 
responsible for any student or other  fees payable in relation to
candidature.

Additional funds for conference travel and thesis production may be 
available from CoACT.
 
The Scholarship will be initially awarded for a maximum of three 
years, with the possibility of a one year extension.  It is tenable 
only up to the date of submission of the thesis, subject to 
satisfactory progress.

  Conditions related to overseas study, suspension of award, multiple 
awards, employment, sick, maternity and recreation leave will be the 
same as those for the Australian Postgraduate Award Scheme.

The Scholarship holder shall be free to publish any results arising 
from the research.  Any publications shall acknowledge that the work 
was done while holding the Scholarship.

Applications should be made on the application form available from
