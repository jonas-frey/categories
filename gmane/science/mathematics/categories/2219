Postdoctoral research fellow (University of Nottingham)
Doctoral studentship (University of Oxford)
in DATATYPE-GENERIC PROGRAMMING

The Universities of Nottingham and Oxford have positions available to work
on an EPSRC-supported project entitled "Datatype-Generic Programming",
running for three years and starting on or shortly after 1st August
2003. There is a postdoctoral research fellowship at Nottingham, and a
DPhil studentship at Oxford.

The project is to develop a novel mechanism for parametrizing programs,
namely parametrization by a datatype or type constructor.  The mechanism is
related to parametric polymorphism, but of higher order. We aim to develop
a calculus for constructing datatype-generic programs, with the ultimate
goal of improving the state of the art in generic object-oriented
programming, as occurs for example in the C++ Standard Template Library.
Further details of the project can be obtained from the contacts listed
below.

Applicants for the postdoctoral fellowship should have completed (or
be about to complete) a PhD degree. Preference will be given to
applicants with an excellent knowledge of the calculational style of
reasoning.  Expertise in functional programming, object-oriented
programming and the mathematics of program construction is
required. Send a detailed curriculum vitae and the names and addresses
of two referees to Professor Roland Backhouse, School of Computer
Science and Information Technology, University of Nottingham, Jubilee
Campus, Wollaton Road, Nottingham NG8 1BB, UK, rcb@cs.nott.ac.uk,
www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~rcb, from whom further details can also be
obtained. Electronic applications should be sent in PDF format; other
formats will not be accepted.

The ideal applicant for the DPhil studentship would have (or be about to
obtain) a first- or upper-second class honours degree or equivalent in
computer science, with expertise in functional programming, object-oriented
programming and the mathematics of program construction.  The studentship
pays for all university and college fees, in addition to the standard EPSRC
maintenance grant.  Applicants should follow the procedure described at
www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/courses/grad02-03/dphil/requirements.html, but
should also mention this position in the application.  For further details
contact Dr Jeremy Gibbons, Oxford University Computing Laboratory, Wolfson
Building, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QD, UK, jeremy.gibbons@comlab.ox.ac.uk,
www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/people/jeremy.gibbons.html.

The closing date for applications for both positions is Monday 14th April
2003.
