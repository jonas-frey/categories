"A THEORY OF LEAST-CHANGE FOR BIDIRECTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS"
Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford

Applications are invited for a Research Fellowship on an EPSRC-funded pro=
ject "A Theory of Least-Change for Bidirectional Transformations". The pr=
oject is a collaboration between Professor Jeremy Gibbons in the Departme=
nt of Computer Science, University of Oxford, and Dr Perdita Stevens and =
Dr James Cheney in the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh.=20

The project concerns bidirectional transformations, which are a means of =
maintaining consistency between multiple information sources: when one so=
urce is edited, the others may need updating to restore consistency. Ther=
e are applications in model-driven engineering, database design, and prog=
ram development, among others.  A bidirectional transformation can be imp=
lemented in terms of several unidirectional restoring functions, one per =
source; but this duplicates information, wasting effort and risking incon=
sistencies. Bidirectional transformation languages allow one to describe =
the consistency relationship and the restoring functions with a single de=
clarative specification.

Our aim in this project is to study the principle of least change: that a=
  bidirectional transformation should not make unnecessary or unnecessaril=
y large changes when it re-establishes consistency. The primary focus of =
the Oxford contribution is the development of a theory of alignment for b=
idirectional transformations on structured data, especially in the case o=
f non-free datatypes such as associative lists and graphs. We conjecture =
that the mathematics of container datatypes and combinatorial species wil=
l be particularly relevant.

The Fellowship will be under the supervision of Professor Jeremy Gibbons =
at
Oxford, and is available for three years from 31st August 2013 (or any ti=
me
before that). The salary is on a standard scale, from =A329,541 to =A336,=
298
per annum. For further details, including a job description and informati=
on
on how to apply, please see the webpage (http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/news/619-=
full.html). If you have any questions, please write to me (jeremy.gibbons=
@cs.ox.ac.uk). Please pass this advert on to anyone you think may be inte=
rested.
