Dear Andre,


Of course I agree with you in that the natural world is only partially expl=
ained by science. I also believe that much of mathematics has been inspired=
  by a desire to apply it to the natural sciences. Notice, however, that I s=
aid "much" and not "all",  and here is where mathematics and the natural sc=
iences differ. Mathematicians have a freedom not afforded to scientists.  I=
t is this freedom which allows the invention of objects such as the complex=
  numbers or of the infinitesimals. Now, is it a mystery that such products =
of the human mind find applications in scientific theories, or is it rather=
  that the latter themselves are also the product of the human mind? After a=
ll, it is only through rational thinking (including intuition) that we are =
able to (believe we) understand the natural world. Now, what about actual a=
pplications of science? Those are not just the product of the theories them=
selves, but also of experimentation and of successive approximations. It is=
  for this reason that I see no mystery in that certain scientific theories =
can sometimes be succesfully applied. Whether this is or is not a metaphysi=
cal point of view it is not for me to say.


Best regards,

Marta

Dear Marta,

Mathematics and science are very often regarded
as the pure product of human rationality.
I can agree with the importance of rationality, except that humanity
is as much the product of nature as it is of rational choices.
You will agree that the natural world is only partially explained by scienc=
e.
The rest is a big mystery. Not that the mystery is absolutly impenetrable.
I feel compelled to recognize the presence of mysteries even
in mathematics. The history of complex numbers, from the
discovery by Cardano to their applications in quantum physics is bewilderin=
g.
They belong to this universe as much as the electron and the human mind.
The fact that we human can understand  complex numbers may
have a metaphysical meaning.
What is it?

Best,
Andr=E9
