Dear Fred,

I keep your notations. The concreteness of A is far from enough to
justify the definition you give, namely:

> Ever since Eckmann-Hilton, and perhaps even before, the notion of an
> object G in one category X bearing the structure of an object in some
> concrete other category A (concrete via U: A -> Sets, say) has been
> clearly and unambiguously expressed as follows:

> The hom functor X(-, G): X^op -> Sets is given a factorization thru'
> U.

Eckman and Hilton considered only the case when A is a category of
essentially algebraic (i.e. definable by projective limits) structures
over Sets. In more general cases, it just doesn't work. You can't even
prove, for X=A, that an object G of X bears the structure of an object
of A.
Take for A the concrete category of totally ordered sets and order-
preserving functions, with U the obvious forgetful functor.
The same is true for A=Fields, A=Topological Spaces, A=Finite Sets,
etc., to take very simple examples.

Bien amicalement,
Jean
