I can't claim the credit either: the wording above is mine, but I 
copied the idea from something written by Bill Lawvere. I can't now
find the reference, but I think it may have been in his 1976 Chicago
lecture notes on "Variable Sets, Etendu and Variable Structures in
Topoi" (of which I no longer have a copy).
