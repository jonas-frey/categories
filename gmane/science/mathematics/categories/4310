I do not understand what is meant by "external" here.  What Colin and
Osius's replacement scheme states is that every *definable* family of
sets is internal.  This is the same as the ZF replacement axiom: every
*definable* function defined on a set is a set.  Since there are only
countably many logical formulas, there are only countably many
definable families for them to define, so there is no problem with
countable models.

In Osius' paper "Categorical set theory" he does prove exactly this
sort of equivalence, by adding a couple weaker extra axioms to ETCS
and bZ relating to the existence of transitive closures and collapses.
 An account can also be found in Johnstone's "Topos Theory", chapter
9.
