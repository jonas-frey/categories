            FM'06: 14TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FORMAL METHODS

                             21 - 27 August 2006
                McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada
                          http://fm06.mcmaster.ca/

                    ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS


FM'06 is the fourteenth in a series of symposia organized by Formal
Methods Europe, http://www.fmeurope.org, an independent association
whose
aim is to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for
software development.  The symposia have been notably successful in
bringing together innovators and practitioners in precise mathematical
methods for software development, industrial users as well as
researchers.  Submissions are welcomed in the form of original papers on
research and industrial experience, proposals for workshops and
tutorials, entries for the exhibition of software tools and projects,
and
reports on ongoing doctoral work.

FM'06 welcomes all aspects of formal methods research, both theoretical
and practical.  We are particularly interested in the experience of
applying formal methods in practice.  The broad topics of interest of
this conference are:

* Tools for formal methods: tool support and software engineering,
   environments for formal methods.

* Theoretical foundations: specification and modelling, refining, static
   analysis, model-checking, verification, calculation, reusable domain
   theories.

* Formal methods in practice: experience with introducing formal methods
   in industry, case studies.

* Role of formal methods: formal methods in hardware and system design,
   method integration, development process.


TECHNICAL PAPERS
Full papers should be submitted via the web site.  Papers will be
evaluated by the Program Committee according to their originality,
significance, soundness, quality of presentation and relevance with
respect to the main issues of the symposium.  Accepted papers will be
published in the Symposium Proceedings, to appear in Springer's Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series, http://www.springeronline.com/lncs .
Submitted papers should have not been submitted elsewhere for
publication, should be in Springer's format, (see Springer's web site),
and should not exceed 16 pages including appendices.  A prize for the
best technical paper will be awarded at the symposium.

INDUSTRIAL USAGE REPORTS
One day will be dedicated to sharing the experience -- both positive and
negative -- with using formal methods in industrial environments.  The
Industry Day is organized by ForTIA, the Formal Techniques Industry
Association, http://www.fortia.org .  This year's Industry Day
investigates the use of formal methods in security and trust.  Invited
papers on organizational and technical issues will be presented.
Inquiries should be directed to the Industry Day Chairs; see the web
site
for details.

WORKSHOPS
We welcome proposals for one-day or one-and-a-half-day workshops related
to FM'06.  In particular, but not exclusively, we encourage proposals
for
workshops on various application domains.  Proposals should be directed
to the Workshop Chair.

TUTORIALS
We are soliciting proposals for full-day or half-day tutorials.  The
tutorial contents can be selected from a wide range of topics that
reflect the conference themes and provide clear utility to
practitioners.
Each proposal will be evaluated on importance, relevance, timeliness,
audience appeal and past experience and qualification of the
instructors.
Proposals should be directed to the Tutorial Chair.

POSTER AND TOOL EXHIBITION
An exhibition of both research projects and commercial tools will
accompany the technical symposium, with the opportunity of holding
scheduled presentations of commercial tools.  Proposals should be
directed to the Poster and Tools Exhibition Chair.

DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM
For the first time, FM'06 will feature a doctoral symposium.  Students
are invited to submit work in progress and to defend it in front of
"friendly examiners".  Participation for students who are accepted will
be subsidized.  Submissions should be directed to the Doctoral Symposium
Chair.
