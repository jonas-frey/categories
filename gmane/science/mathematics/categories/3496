Hi everyone,

Todd Wilson asks :

It seems to me that the problem of
"characterizing the algebraic theories giving rise to varieties where all=
 the epis are surjective"
(posed by Bill Lawvere in
Some algebraic problems in the context..., LNM 61 (1968) )
is still essentially open. Anyone knows otherwise?
(A "classical" version might be to find a - syntactic-  condition on the =
equations necessary and sufficient to have all epis surjective in its cat=
egory of its models)
