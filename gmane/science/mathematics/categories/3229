I agree but that is not my point. I did not want to judge what is "good" or "deep"
mathematics. Of course, deep results are difficult to uderstand even for specialists,
and the existence of infinitely many primes or the party theorem are definitively not
deep. But their proofs require some amount of mathemtical thinking, which is on the
other hand still comprehensible for non mathematicians. So they can learn how
mathematics works. Then we can tell them about Fermat's Last Theorem or
applications in computerized tomography, certainly without proofs.

One point is selling mathematics to nonmathematicians, the other is selling
categories to other mathematicians (not necessarily to physicists). In general,
nonmathematicians don't even know what sets and functions are and why they are
needed in mathematics. I think that category theory makes several things clearer
(and also easier) and reveals connections and similarities between different branches
of mathematics. It is quite nice if it can also be used as a foundation, but for me this
is not the most important aspect.
