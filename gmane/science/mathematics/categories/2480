I will stick to my perception that if you dealing with Hilbert or Banach
spaces isomorphisms should be just that.  It makes no difference to the
*-autonomous structure anyway.

For Banach spaces, if you take as underlying functor the closed unit ball,
it has an adjoint.  It is not tripleable, however, but C^*-algebras are
(with the unit ball underlying functor).
