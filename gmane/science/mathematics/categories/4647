Agreed.  Per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BOLD I replaced the
offending article with something aiming for a middle ground and
shamelessly stealing some of your references (thanks!).  See

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_object&diff=242209011&oldid=242199687

for the previous version.

It might also be worth mentioning coalgebras, and perhaps more
importantly dually defined structures such as locales which are
understood better in terms of the morphisms from them to a cogenerator
rather than those to them from a generator, i.e. dual elements rather
than elements.  Also toposes as a more general codomain of the forgetful
functor than the particular topos Set.

Thanks for pointing out this article---Wikipedia is full of problem
articles like this and finding them and getting them into shape is an
ongoing project.
