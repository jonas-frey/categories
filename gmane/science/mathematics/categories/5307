Hi -

I think I watched this documentary a while ago.  I watched only a few
minutes of it today and then realized that I should probably be doing
something else.  However, I was interested and want to comment briefly.

I am not sure what it means for one's genius to drive him or her insane.
>From what I can gather in this summary and my recollection of the film, the
director seems to exploit the illnesses of some of these men to provide som=
e
theatrical drama to the story.  If this is so, then it seems rather
irresponsible.  If I am mistaken and have not watched enough of the video,
then my apologies to the director.

This statement does not directly blame the illness on his struggle with
mathematics, but it seems dangerously suggestive of this conclusion.  Here
is a quote from Wikipedia:

Cantor's recurring bouts of
depression<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression>from 1884
to the end of his life were once blamed on the hostile attitude of
many of his contemporaries,[9]<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor#ci=
te_note-daub280-8>but
these episodes can now be seen as probable manifestations of a bipolar
disorder <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder>.[10]<http://en.wik=
ipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor#cite_note-bipolar-9>

This seems like the more reasonable, albeit possibly less glamorous
description of the causes of Cantor's illnesses.  Since I did not watch
further I cannot comment on the others, except that I did not know of any
mental disorders associated to Turing.

Best,
Alex Hoffnung
