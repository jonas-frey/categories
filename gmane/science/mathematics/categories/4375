Dear Francois,

I don't know how relevant this is to your thinking, but I thought I'd =20=

mention the result is constructively false.

For an example, let C be the poset with two elements b <=3D t. The only =20=

idempotents are the identities on b and t, so of course they split.

Let p be a truth value, and let I =3D {b} u {t | p}, an ideal (hence =20
directed) in C. If this has a colimit, then it must be either b or t. =20=

The colimit is b iff not p (so I =3D {b}), and it follows that if the =20=

colimit is t we have not not p. Hence existence of the colimit gives =20
(not p or not not p) for every p, which is not intuitionistically valid.

In fact one way to regard the set of truth values (i.e. the subobject =20=

classifier) is as the ideal completion of C.

Regards,

Steve.
