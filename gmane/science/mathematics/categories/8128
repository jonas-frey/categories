Colleagues

It is with deep sadness that I inform you of the passing away of Keith A. =
Hardie yesterday, 19 May 2014,
at his home in Muizenberg, Cape Town. Keith has, among other things, made =
great contributions
on homotopy in categories of pairs of topological spaces. The last of his =
5 PhD students, I completed=20
just as Keith was retiring from the university. This put me in the =
privileged default position for continued=20
collaborative work. I treasure the relationship I had with him as my =
teacher, coworker and friend.=20
Just the same he will be sorely missed by his collaborators, colleagues, =
close friends and many others.=20
My condolences are with the bereaved family.
