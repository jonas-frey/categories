To my best knowledge, Fabio Gadducci has, for some time now,
been applying category-theoretic structures to graph term rewriting,
and has written a couple of relevant survey papers which feature
extensive bibliographic references. I believe these papers may be
found in his home page (http://www.di.unipi.it/~gadducci/) even though
his links may seem a bit cryptic at first. 

My understanding of your question is that you're interested in
rewriting graphs which encode the structure of terms in some signature
(or the structure of program terms in some programming language). If,
instead, it is the rewriting of graphs (independent of specific
interpretations) or of programs in visual languages that you are
interested in, then I would be happy to provide more specific
pointers, as the latter area of research is closer to my own
interests.
