Dear Keith,

This reply to the reply is actually more ambiguous... What do you mean
with "extension"?

Anyway, I find it interesting, in the groupoids case, the paper:

"Categorical non abelian cohomology, and the Schreier theory of groupoids",
V. Blanco, M. Bullejos, E. Faro,

on the arXiv as math.CT/0410202.

Best regards,
Beppe Metere.
