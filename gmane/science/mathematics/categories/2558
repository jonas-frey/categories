I like Xy-Pic very much (with LaTeX).  It can do that.  You would probably
use the "graph" feature or see the worked example on p. 10 of the user's
guide.

The downside is that the user's guide and the reference manual are very
spotty.  I find the only way to learn to use Xy-pic, and then to learn to
use any given feature, is to copy the examples out of the relevant section
of the user's guide or the reference manual and fool around with them until
you see which parts do what.  The Xy-pic chapter of the LaTeX GRAPHICS
COMPANION was *extremely* helpful to me.
