Indeed; but what we construct is not just a set, it's a category! :-)

In Toby's construction \C |---> arr \C, the setoid structure of the
hom-sets of \C is _not_ respected if you just look at the underlying
objects of arr \C, but it _is_ respected once you look at the whole
resulting category arr \C.

This is surely no worse than the fact that in just about any construction
on setoids X |---> F(X), if you look at the underlying set of F(X), this
will not fully respect the setoid structure of X?

The trouble here is that the original setoid structure is not on the whol=
e
arrow-set C_1, but on the individual hom-sets C_1(a,b).  The arrow
category sums this up over all a,b:C_0, and so is no longer a setoid from
this data alone.  (A dependent sum of setoids over a set doesn't have a
natural setoid structure, as far as I can see?)

In our case, of course, the object-sets _are_ also naturally setoids, wit=
h
their equalities given by isomorphisms of the categories.  But we don't
want to think of this setoid structure as primary: it's just a coarse
reflection of part of the overall category structure.

Going on from the above, it's an extension to the statement "we are only
interested in elements of a setoid up to the given equality relation".  S=
o
a more precise statement could go along the lines of:  Any construction
dependent on objects should respect isomorphisms.

Best,
