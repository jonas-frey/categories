Well, (*) is the same of what I wrote in my posting in the subject:

Of course, it is the same if we are talking of the same thing. That we
are.

When I say "strict", I mean it in the sense of SGA4 Expose I, 10.2 10.3,
and we should assume that it coincides with what M. Barr calls
"effective". Contrary to M. Barr terminology, "effective" is also utilizad
in SGA4, presicely, when the kernel pair exists !

Concerning the above notion (*) of "stability under pull-backs without
pull-backs" (an instance of "universality"), it is also defined in
SGA4 Expose II 2.5, and it is simply the following:

an arrow F: X ---> Y (singleton family) is a strict universal epimorphism
if it is a cover for the canonical topology.

In Proposition 2.6 it is stablished the characterization of strict
universal epimorphisms by the property (*) above.
