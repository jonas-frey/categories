Let me add to the remarks on the extent to which Bourbaki did -- or =

did not -- envisage categories or category theory as an appropriate =

vehicle for conveying universal constructs in their expositions of =

other mathematics, by mentioning in this context the late Serge Lang's =

now half-century-old report, originally prepared "for Bourbaki's internal=
  =

consumption", on the cohomology of groups: {Rapport sur la Cohomologie =

des Groupes}, W.A. Benjamin, NY, 1966.

On page 97 of the Benjamin publication, Serge seeks to "definir la
notion de cat=E9gorie multilin=E9aire", notion which his PREFACE indicate=
s
is "due to Cartier" and which figures not only in these 1959-era notes
but also in the first-year graduate algebra course he gave at Columbia =

during the 1958-1959 academic year. (It was my first year at Columbia,
and I remember that course well -- it gave me not only my first exposure
too Serge Lang, and to categories, but to Saul Lubkin and Peter Freyd as
well, each of whom Serge invited to give a "guest lecture" for a day
(it was the era of the "race for the best embedding theorem":-) ).

Whatever else may have been the case then or earlier as regards Bourbaki =

and categories, by 1959 even multilinear categories were being pressed
upon Bourbaki in certain quarters, by certain proponents, without, alas,
much perceptible effect.

Cheers, -- Fred
