Probably not... `triples.math.mcgill.ca' has been inoperative since before 
the ice-storm began, which means that many category-theorists in Montreal 
have not been receiving e-mail from this mailing list even before the 

[ note from moderator: actually, the list has been reaching the McGill 
people - until last week of course... ]

blackouts, etc. began.  I think power has been restored to most of the island 
of Montreal (the downtown area lost power at 3pm on Friday, and was still 
without it when I left on Saturday evening), but the electrical infrastructure 
of the South Shore has been destroyed to the point that it must be replaced 
from scratch.  Now that temperatures have dropped to the more usual range for 
this time of year, mass evacuation of the hardest-hit areas by the army is a 
distinct possibility.
