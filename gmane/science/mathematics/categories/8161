Hi all,

The Kan Extension Seminar will present a series of eight 15-minute =
expository talks on Sunday June 29th at Winstanley Lecture Theatre in =
Trinity College. We=92ll have tea starting at 2pm with the first talks =
to commence at 2:30. There will be a short break around 3:50pm with the =
second series of talks to begin at 4:10. The talks should finish around =
5:30, at which point we=92ll walk together to the welcome reception for =
the CT.

Please join us! We=92ve got a fantastic line-up of talks that promise to =
be interesting and yet understandable with very little assumed =
background. I=92ve listed the speakers and titles below. Abstracts and =
more information can be found here:

Please don=92t hesitate to get in touch with questions. I hope to see =
you there.
