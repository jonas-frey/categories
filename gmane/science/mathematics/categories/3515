Following Gabor's line of reasoning, and paying the utmost attention
not to confuse cause with effect, it would be OK for us to invest in
narcotics: after all, if people wouldn't use drugs, we wouldn't be
making any money, the market would regulate itself and we would get
what we deserve.

I have to add that I missed the connection with Iraq and the rest.
There is an elephant in the room that Gabor seems to fail to notice:
if the allegations are true, Elsevier would be investing money we
directly make for them with our own (unpaid) work. Which -- whatever
side you take in the dispute -- makes a call for boycott legitimate.
My pension fund is bound to ethical investments, my employer too; I
don't see why I shouldn't ask so for my publisher.
