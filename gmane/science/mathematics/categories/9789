UC|UP Joint PhD Program in Mathematics 2019/2020

The UC|UP Joint PhD Program in Mathematics, run by the Universities of
Coimbra and Porto, in Portugal, welcomes applications for the academic
year of 2019/2020.

The Program will offer 6 doctoral scholarships (covering tuition fees
and living expenses) to selected candidates through the Portuguese
funding agency FCT. All areas of Mathematics are covered in the Program,
in particular: Algebra Analysis/Differential Equations Discrete
Mathematics/Combinatorics Dynamical Systems Geometry/Topology Numerical
Analysis/Optimization Probability/Statistics The first call for
applications is open from**

***January 02, 2019 to February 04, 2019.* Applications are to be
donethrough the website

http://www.mat.uc.pt/phd_prog

Extensive information about the Program is available at the website (and
additional questions can be posed using phd_prog@mat.uc.pt).
Furthermore, "la Caixa Foundation" offers PhD grants for some research
projects?? to be pursued at the Center for Mathematics of the University
of Coimbra. In this case, besides the application to the PhD Program in
the above link,?? the applications to those PhD grants should be
submitted until?? 6 February?? 2019 at
