Just call it the internal hom.

The point is, you can just look at a category and say, yes or no,
whether it's cartesian closed.  So cartesian closedness is a "property"
of a category - not a "structure" that you might equip a category with
in more than one way.

Nonetheless, you can consider properties as a special case of
structures - namely, those structures for which you have at most
one one choice.  And if you do this you're free to speak of a cartesian
closed "structure".

Similarly, you can consider structures as a special case of "stuff".

If you don't know the yoga of "properties, structure and stuff", you
might enjoy this paper where Mike Shulman and I explain it:
