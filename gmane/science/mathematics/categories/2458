I'm not sure where the above quote is taken from but I agree it is confusing.

Here is my argument in favour of the traditional name.

As Bill says, an element of an object F in a category is generally
any morphism A --> F  into  F.  It just happens that in many
categories  F  is determined by elements with a restricted class of
domains  A.  In Set, we can restrict  A  to be terminal.  In a
presheaf category, we can restrict  A  to be representable.  The
objects of the category  elF  of elements of  F  are (up to
isomorphism) elements  A --> F  with  A  representable.  It is also
conventional to name categories after their objects (although the
Ehresmann convention of naming them after their morphisms is more
precise). Hence  elF  is the category of elements of  F.
