I first met Harold Simmons at a PSSL in Cambridge (1999?) where my =
accommodation was a nice bed&breakfast where Peter Johnstone had placed =
both him and me. We spent the breakfasts talking about things that (of =
course) included frames and quantales, along with funny anecdotes about =
other =E2=80=98framers=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98quantalers=E2=80=99. Since =
then I keep an indelible memory of a sharp, very kind and good humoured =
man.
