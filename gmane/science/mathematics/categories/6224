Dear all,

Very briefly.

Many good things in mathematics are depending on the choice=20
of a representation which is not invariant under equivalences,
or under isomorphisms. Modern geometry would not exists=20
without coordinate systems. This is true also of algebra
and category theory. Algebraic structures are often described by=20
generators and relations. Homological algebra is using non-canonical
projective or injective resolutions. Choosing a base point may help=20
computing the fundamental group of a topological space.
Choosing a triangulation may help computing the homology groups.
Invariant notions are often constructed from notions which are not.
For example, the Euler characteristic of a space
is best explaned by using a triangulation.

Another example from homotopy theory:=20
the notion of homotopy pullback square in a Quillen model category is=20
invariant under weak equivalences, but its definition depends on=20
the notion of pullback square which is not invariant under weak =
equivalences!

Part of the art of mathematics is in constructing invariant notions=20
from non-invariant ones. We should recognize the usefulness and
importance of the latter. Please, let us not call them "evil"!

Best,
Andr=E9

PS: We should reserve the word "evil" to name things that really are.
