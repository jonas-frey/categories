                      "Haskell 2011"

              ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2011
                       Tokyo, Japan
                   22nd September, 2011

                      CALL FOR PAPERS

       http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2011/

The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2011 will be co-located with the
2011 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), in
Tokyo, Japan.

The purpose of the Haskell Symposium is to discuss experiences with
Haskell and future developments for the language. The scope of the
symposium includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory,
application, implementation, and teaching of Haskell.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 * Language Design, with a focus on possible extensions and
   modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the
   status quo;

 * Theory, such as formal treatments of the semantics of the present
   language or future extensions, type systems, and foundations
   for program analysis and transformation;

 * Implementations, including program analysis and transformation,
   static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and
   distributed architectures, memory management as well as foreign
   function and component interfaces;

 * Tools, in the form of profilers, tracers, debuggers, pre-processors,
   testing tools, and suchlike;

 * Functional Pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of using
   Haskell;

 * Applications, using Haskell for scientific and symbolic computing,
   database, multimedia, telecom and web applications, and so forth;

 * Practice and Experience, general experience with Haskell in education
   and industry.

Papers in the latter three categories need not necessarily report
original research results; they may instead, for example, report
practical experience that will be useful to others, reusable
programming idioms, or elegant new ways of approaching a
problem. (More advice appears on the symposium webpage.)
The key criterion for such a paper is that it makes a
contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. It is not
enough simply to describe a program!


Submission Details

 * Submission Deadline: Monday, 6th June 2011
 * Author Notification: Friday, 1st July 2011
 * Final Papers Due   : Sunday, 10th July 2011

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF),
formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm). The text
should be in a 9pt font in two columns; the length is restricted to
12 pages, except for "Applications, Practice, and Experience"
papers, which are restricted to 6 pages. Each submission must
adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as explained on the web.
Violation risks summary rejection of the offending submission.
Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the
ACM Digital Library.

In addition, we solicit proposals for system demonstrations, based
on running (perhaps prototype) software rather than necessarily on
novel research results. Proposals are limited to 2-page abstracts,
in the same ACM format as papers, and should explain why a
demonstration would be of interest to the Haskell community. They
will be assessed for relevance by the PC; accepted proposals will
be published on the Symposium website, but not formally published
in the proceedings.
