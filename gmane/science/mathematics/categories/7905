          CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND CO-LOCATED EVENT PROPOSALS
                             ICFP 2014
  19th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
                    August 31 =96 September 6, 2014
                         Gothenburg, Sweden
                http://icfpconference.org/icfp2014/

The 19th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
Programming will be held in Gothenburg, Sweden on August 31-September
6, 2014.  ICFP provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear
about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and
uses of functional programming.

Proposals are invited for workshops (and other co-located events, such
as tutorials) to be affiliated with ICFP 2014 and sponsored by
SIGPLAN.  These events should be less formal and more focused than ICFP
itself, include sessions that enable interaction among the attendees,
and foster the exchange of new ideas.  The preference is for one-day
events, but other schedules can also be considered.

The workshops are scheduled to occur on August 31 (the day before
ICFP) and September 4-6 (the three days after ICFP).

workshops, please fill in the workshop proposal form and just leave
blank any sections that do not apply.)  Please note that this is a
firm deadline.

Organizers will be notified if their event proposal is accepted by
December 15, 2013, and if successful, depending on the event, they
will be asked to produce a final report after the event has taken
place that is suitable for publication in SIGPLAN Notices.
