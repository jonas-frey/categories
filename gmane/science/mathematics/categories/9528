Dear Steve,

Let me use this opportunity to ask a question 'at a lower level', referring
to papers listed at the end of this message. How seriously it is related to
your question? I don't know, but since I was going to ask it one day anyway=
,
let me ask it now:

As you know, taking connected components gives reflections:

(a) Locally connected spaces--->Sets,
(b) Compact Hausdorff spaces--->Stone spaces,

and although it is easy to put them together to involve all topological
spaces, there is no NICE such reflection. But what is "nice"? To me,
inspired by Galois theory, "nice" would mean "Grothendieck fibration", or,
equivalently in this case, it means "semi-left-exact" in the sense of [CHK]=
.
The fact that (a) is semi-left-exact is used in Galois theory in my several
papers with and without co-authors, but I would rather call it a folklore
result (probably very old, and, for example, hidden in a sense in [BD]). Th=
e
fact that (b) is semi-left-exact and even has stable units in the sense of
[CHK], which is also easy, is explicitly stated and used in [CJKP], to
define the (compact) monotone-light factorization categorically; various
analogous results (but in different categories) are obtained by J. J. Xarez=
.
A more general story, but with weaker results (still sufficient for
something in Galois theory) are in [CJ]. Another kind of developments, very
interesting and involving toposes, are in several papers of M. Bunge, some
with J. Funk - I am not listing them since Marta can obviously do it better=
.

My question is a 'localic question' (this is what I mean by "lower level"),
but it might indeed be related to your 'topos-theoretic question':

As you know, a locale is called 0-dimensional if all its elements are joins
of complemented ones. By a morphism L--->L' of locales I shall mean a map
L'--->L that preserves all joins and finite meets (as usually). The
inclusion functor

0-Dimensional locales--->Locales

has a left adjoint F, for which

F(L)=3D{x in L | x is a join of complementary elements}.

Question: Is F semi-left-exact?

I mentioned this question several times in past to several people... I am
very interested to know the answer, no matter whether it is YES or NO; if
NO, then I have weaker questions...

Best regards, George
