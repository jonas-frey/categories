=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D  ICALP 2020 - Conference relocation and deadline ex=
tension =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D


The ICALP and the LICS steering committee have agreed together with the
conference chairs in Beijing
to relocate the two conferences. ICALP and LICS 2020 will take place in
Saarbr=C3=BCcken, Germany,
July 8-11 (with satellite workshops on July 6-7).

We are very grateful to our colleagues in Beijing, for the organization
so far, to the colleagues
from Saarbr=C3=BCcken, who generously accepted this challenging task, and=
  to
all members of
the TCS community who offered their help in this difficult situation.

The deadline is extended, see below.

annual meeting of the European Association for Theoretical Computer
Science (EATCS). ICALP 2020 will be hosted on the Saarland Informatics
Campus
in Saarbr=C3=BCcken, in co-location with LICS 2020 (ACM/IEEE Symposium on=

Logic in Computer Science).


Invited speakers:
