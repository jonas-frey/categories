Dear George,

There is indeed such a connection between asymmetric distances
and directed algebraic topology, but is not entirely trivial. The
obvious solution,
by 'left' and 'right topologies' would not work well. The good
solution, in my
opinion, is constructing a 'symmetric topology' and adding
distinguished paths.

All this is in my book, and also in a paper:
M. Grandis,
The fundamental weighted category of a weighted space: From directed
to weighted algebraic topology,
Homology Homotopy Appl. 9 (2007), 221-256.

I am presently working with a colleague. Later, I will be able to
comment more precisely on
these points.

All the best

Marco
