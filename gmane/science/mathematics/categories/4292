Yes,  What you do is start with ETCS, and adjoin an axiom scheme of
replacement.

The axiom scheme says: Suppose a formula associates to each element x of
a set S a set we may call Sx (unique up to isomorphism).  Then there is
some function f:X-->S such that the fiber of f over each element x is
isomorphic to Sx.

Lawvere's ETCS plus this axiom scheme is intertanslateable in the
obvious way with ZF, preserving theorems in both directions (you may
include AxCh in both ETCS and ZF, or exclude it from both).

This has been known from the earliest days of categorical set theory.
My favorite early published proof was stated slightly differently, using
reflection rather than replacement, but it trivially comes to the same
thing.  That is:

The proof in Osius (and several later tests) implies that every
consistent extension of a certain very weak fragment of ZF is
intertranslateable (preserving theorems) with a corresponding extension
of a certain slight extension of ETCS.

Further, when you read the proof, you see the correspondence is entirely
natural.

For details on replacement (as opposed to Osius's use of reflection) and
foundational discussion see
