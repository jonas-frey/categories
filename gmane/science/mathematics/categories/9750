TOPICS

Submissions are solicited in semantics, logics, verification and analysis o=
f concurrent systems. The principal topics include (but are not limited to)=
:

     Basic models of concurrency such as abstract machines, domain-theoretic=
  models, game-theoretic models, process algebras, graph transformation syst=
ems, Petri nets, hybrid systems, mobile and collaborative systems, probabil=
istic systems, real-time systems, biology-inspired systems, and synchronous=
  systems;
     Logics for concurrency such as modal logics, probabilistic and stochast=
ic logics, temporal logics, and resource logics;
     Verification and analysis techniques for concurrent systems such as abs=
tract interpretation, atomicity checking, model checking, race detection, p=
re-order and equivalence checking, run-time verification, state-space explo=
ration, static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem proving, type systems,=
  and security analysis;
     Distributed algorithms and data structures: design, analysis, complexit=
y, correctness, fault tolerance, reliability, availability, consistency, se=
lf-organization, self-stabilization, protocols;
     Theoretical foundations of architectures, execution environments, and s=
oftware development for concurrent systems such as geo-replicated systems, =
communication networks, multiprocessor and multi-core architectures, shared=
  and transactional memory, resource management and awareness, compilers and=
  tools for concurrent programming, programming models such as component-bas=
ed, object- and service-oriented.


PAPER SUBMISSION

CONCUR 2019 solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or =
experience related to the topics mentioned below. All papers must be origin=
al, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere.

Each paper will undergo a thorough review process. The paper may be supplem=
ented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be reviewed at the discret=
ion of the program committee.

The CONCUR 2019 proceedings will be published by LIPIcs.

Papers must be submitted electronically as PDF files via EasyChair.

Papers must not exceed 14 pages (excluding references and clearly marked ap=
pendices) using the LIPIcs style.

SPECIAL ISSUE

A special issue dedicated to selected papers from CONCUR'2019 will appear i=
n Logical Methods in Computer Science.
