Following Jeff Egger, who wrote, in part, "Ban is a fine example which
can teach any student of category theory a number of salutary lessons,"
but asking forgiveness for tooting my own horn, I'd like to point out =

another one of those lessons -- my old characterization of Banach =

conjugate spaces as the algebras over the double-dualization monad =

on {Ban}. Neat mix of Beck Theorem, functional analysis, and more, on
pp. 227-240 of: =


Proc. Conf. Integration, Topology, and Geometry in Linear Spaces,
in: Contemporary Mathematics, Volume 2, AMS, Providence, 1980.

Might even serve as one student's "individual reading report" project.

There's also my even older squib on "Functorial Measure Theory," in pp.
36-49 of: Proc. Conf. Functional Analysis, UC Irvine, 3/28-4/1, 1966,
Thompson Book Co., Wash., DC, & Academic Press, London, 1967. This one
breathes life into the slogan, "Measures are adjoint to functions."

Cheers,
