I am aware of Girard's paradox but I was under the (mistaken?)
impression that slightly more than the structure of a locally
cartesian closed category was needed, e.g. a Prop type.

Alex Simpson pointed out this paper to me yesterday. Thank you (to
both of you!) for bringing it to my attention.

Let X be an object. Then it has a name, say u : 1 -> ob U, and by
pulling back u along the universal fibration el U -> ob U, we get a
monomorphism X -> el U. This allows us to run Russell's argument in
the internal logic, cf [McLarty, _Failure of cartesian closedness in
NF_].
