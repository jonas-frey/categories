 			   CALL FOR PAPERS

 		   15th International Conference on
 		      Quantum Physics and Logic
 			      (QPL 2018)

 			    June 3-7, 2018
 			   Halifax, Canada

 				* * *

The 15th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic
(QPL 2018) will take place at Dalhousie University June 3-7, 2018.

The conference brings together researchers working on mathematical
foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and related areas,
with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical tools,
ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages,
semantical methods, and other computer science techniques applied to
the study of physical behaviour in general. Work that applies
structures and methods inspired by quantum theory to other fields
(including computer science) is also welcome.

QPL 2018 will be co-located with the 34th Conference on the
Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS 2018), which
takes place from June 6???9.

IMPORTANT DATES

   April 1: abstract submission
   April 6: paper submission
   May 11: notification of authors
   May 25: final papers ready
   June 3???7: conference

INVITED SPEAKERS

   Debbie Leung (Waterloo)

   Additional invited speakers to be confirmed.

INVITED TUTORIALS

   Teiko Heinosaari (Turku)
   Ciaran Lee (University College London)

SUBMISSIONS

   Prospective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the
   following:

   - Original contributions consist of a 5-12 page extended abstract
     that provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest
     and enough detail to allow the program committee to assess the
     merits of the work. Submission of substantial albeit partial
     results of work in progress is encouraged.

   - Extended abstracts describing work submitted/published elsewhere
     will also be considered, provided the work is recent and relevant
     to the conference. These consist of a 3 page description and should
     include a link to a separate published paper or preprint.

   The conference proceedings will be published in Electronic
   Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) after the
   conference. Only "original contributions" are eligible to be
   published in the proceedings.

   Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX, and must be submitted in
   PDF format. Use of the EPTCS style is encouraged. Submission is done
   via EasyChair:

   https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qpl2018

   There will be an award for the best student paper at the discretion
   of the programme committee. Papers eligible for the award are those
   where all the authors are students at the time of submission.
