A (limit) sketch in the sense of Ehresmann is a family of cones on a =20
category C.
A cone is a natural transformation pointing right in a triangle whose =20=

top horizontal
side is

 	X ------> 1

and whose bottom vertex is C. A cone is the special case of what I =20
called a theory with
A =3D X and B =3D D =3D 1 (the terminal category).

Now let A be the coproduct (disjoint union) of all the categories X in =20=

the sketch and let B =3D D be
the discrete category obtained by adding up all the 1s, one for each =20
index of the family.
Take u : A --> B to be the induced map on the coproducts. Take t to be =20=

the identity. The cones
give a single natural transformation tau using the 2-universal =20
property of coproduct.

So a sketch on C is the same as one of my theories with B discrete and =20=

t an identity.

The extra flexibility of having B not necessarily discrete and tagging =20=

on the t was aiming
at theories in the sense of

John Isbell [General functorial semantics. I. Amer. J. Math. 94 =20
(1972), 535=96596; MR0396718 (53 #580)].
