As a good example of a proof giving an explanation using categorical
methods  like the proof of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem for the
fundamental group in
Crowell, R.~H.
\newblock \enquote{On the van {K}ampen theorem}.
\newblock \emph{Pacific J. Math.} \textbf{9} (1959) 43--50.

It does not quite use modern categorical language but in essence it
proves a colimit theorem by verifying the required universal property.
This then leads to specific calculations.  Previous proofs were
difficult to understand (e.g. van Kampen's account) or restricted to the
simplicial case. The value of the proof was also that it could be
generalised to the groupoid (many base point) case, and to higher
dimensions, using higher homotopy groupoids.
