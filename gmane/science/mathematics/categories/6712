Dear all,

I sent the following request a few months ago, looking for a "preprint" =
of Lawvere's from 1962. I'm not the only one interested - I got five =
replies, off-list, of the form "If you find it, could I have a copy too, =
please?"=20

I thought I would try one last time. My paper that cites this has been =
accepted for publication, and I'm doing due diligence by trying my best =
to track down original sources!

Does anyone know where I can find a copy?

Thanks again,
Jeremy
