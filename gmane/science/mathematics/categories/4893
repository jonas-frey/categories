The following paragraphs repeat the information from the first
announcement.

The Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia
in cooperation with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences
is hosting the Foundational Methods in Computer Science workshop
on May 28th - 31st, 2009, on the University of British Columbia
Campus in Vancouver, Canada

The workshop is an annual informal meeting intended to bring together
researchers in mathematics and computer science. There is a focus
on the application of category theory in computer science. However, all
those who are interested in category theory or computer science are
welcome to
attend.

The meeting begins with a reception at 6pm in the Ruth Blair room
in Walter Gage Towers on the UBC campus on Thursday May 28, 2009.
The scientific program starts on May 29, and consists of a day of
tutorials
aimed at students and newcomers to category theory, as well as a day and
a half of research talks. The meeting ends at mid-day on May 31.

Research talks

There will be some invited presentations, but the majority of the
talks are solicited from the participants. If you wish to give a talk
please send a title and abstract to johnm@math.ubc.ca. Time
slots are limited, so please register early if you would like to be
considered for a talk.

Graduate student participation is particularly encouraged at FMCS.

Registration details will appear in the next announcement.
