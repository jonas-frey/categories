I=E2=80=99ll confess that the idea of an opposite category appearing as =
the codomain of a functor also makes me somewhat nauseated (the domain =
of course is no problem).=20

But this said, in the interest of full disclosure, I should admit that =
in a joint paper with Cheng and Gurski someone =E2=80=94 Eugenia, I =
believe? =E2=80=94 convinced us that the easiest way to think of a =
functor=20

C x D =E2=80=94> E=20

admitting right adjoints in both variables is as a functor=20

C x D =E2=80=94> (E^op)^op

because in this way (writing E=E2=80=99 for E^op) the other two adjoints =
also have the form

D x E=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94> C^op

and=20

E=E2=80=99 x C =E2=80=94> D^op.

Such two-variable adjunctions form the vertical binary morphisms in a =
=E2=80=9Ccyclic double multi category=E2=80=9D of multivariable =
adjunctions and parametrized mates:
