An addition to Steve's comment:

Going even further back in history these ideas were used in Richard Wood's
thesis: there he started with a bicategory and created a new bicategory by
setting the new 1-cells  (f,X): A --> B :=3D f: A -> X @ B as Steve
suggested.  Composition then uses the associativity isomorphism  ... and
the resulting 1-cell composition is certainly bicategorical.  One can, of
course, also do the I-cell dual construction and, indeed your construction
seems to amalgamate these two constructions.

One can also always extract a category from a bicategory by identifying
isomorphic 1-cells ...
