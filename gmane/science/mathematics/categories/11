Hi David,

This is something I've thought about as well.  If your model category
is a Cat-model category, then by Hovey's general results on enriched
model categories, its homotopy category is automatically enriched over
Ho(Cat), the category of categories and natural-isomorphism-classes of
functors.  A Ho(Cat)-enriched category is like a "bicategory without
coherence," and the question is about lifting that structure to a
coherent bicategory.

However, in this case I believe you can actually always obtain a
strict 2-category equivalent to the bicategory of fractions by just
looking at the full sub-2-category of your model 2-category spanned by
the fibrant and cofibrant objects.  Since any Ho(Cat)-category that is
equivalent (as a Ho(Cat)-category) to a bicategory must itself
underlie a bicategory, you can use this to get a "homotopy bicategory"
without needing the calculus of fractions (which model category theory
is basically designed to avoid).

There is lots of good stuff about Cat-model categories in Steve Lack's
paper "Homotopy-theoretic aspects of 2-monads":
http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0607646.

Best,
Mike
