There will be an informal workshop on

      Quantum Logic Insipred by Quantum Computation

at Indiana University, May 11-12.

Our aim is to organize a small workshop that would bring together people
who are developing new areas of logic coming from quantum computation, and
also people who are interested in related projects coming from areas of
philosophical logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science.

Information on speakers may be found at www.indiana.edu/~iulg/qliqc.

There is no formal registration and all are welcome, but we would
appreciate knowing ahead if you plan to come.
