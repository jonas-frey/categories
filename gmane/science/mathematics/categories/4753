Does anyone know anything about when functors E:C-->D have the property that
the functor Lan_E:[C,Set]-->[D,Set] given  by left Kan extension
is comonadic?

Actually I'm interested in something a bit more general. Let E:C-->D be a
functor. I'm happy to suppose that it is bijective on objects and faithful.
Then Lan_E has a right adjoint, given by
restriction along E. Let W be the induced comonad on [D,Set], and [D,Set]^W
its category of coalgebras. The comparison K:[C,Set]-->[D,Set]^W has a right
adjoint R, constructed using equalizers in [C,Set]. Comonadicity would mean
that this adjunction is an equivalence; what I really want to know is
when/whether R is fully faithful, so that K is a reflection onto a full
subcategory. (This is equivalent to Lan_E preserving the equalizers which
are used to construct R.)

This seems like something topos theorists might know about.

Steve.
