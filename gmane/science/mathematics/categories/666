MASTER CLASS IN MATHEMATICAL LOGIC - REMINDER

Dear colleagues,

This is to remind you of the Master Class in Logic
which will be held in Utrecht, the Netherlands, and
for which we posted an ad some time ago.

The deadline for applications of students who wish to participate but do not
need funding is June 1st; students who wish to
apply for a funding may still do so IF THEIR
APPLICATION REACHES US (that is: Marian Brands, at the
Department of Maths., Utrecht University) BEFORE THE
END OF NEXT WEEK.

We let the text of the original message follow:

In the academic year 1998-1999 the Universities
of Utrecht and Nijmegen organize, as part of
the MRI Master Class, a year-long education program
in Mathematical Logic. The program is aimed at 
students who intend to enter a Ph.D.-program in the 
subsequent year.

The courses are in English and foreign students are
specifically invited to apply. A limited number
of stipends are available.

The contents of the program are detailed
in a brochure which exists both as
hard copy and electronically. The text 
can be seen on the homepage of the
Mathematical Research Institute. URL:

If you're interested in receiving a hard copy 
of the brochure, please send a message to
Marian Brands, at 

brands@math.ruu.nl

Thank you,

Jaap van Oosten
