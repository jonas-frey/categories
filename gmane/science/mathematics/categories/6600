[Note from moderator: Marta is correct that I was careless is posting 
Eduardo's message. It is not about category theory and is not part of any 
thread I am aware of. Any further discussion will not be on the list. 
Thanks.]

Dear Eduardo=2C


Is this part of a thread?=A0Are we supposed to search the categories listin=
gs to look for what you are exactly referring to?=A0Do you realize that in =
so doing we would be taken away from our work or from anything else we woul=
d rather be doing?=A0

MY guess is that your posting would have been rejected by the moderator had=
  the author been someone else=2C and this for any of the following reasons.=
  It contains no mathematics=2C there is no explicit mention of the context=
=2C and an anonymous text is quoted. Moreover=2C if this belongs to a threa=
d=2C it is then not a very recent one and surely as a thread it must have e=
xpired.=A0

If moralizing is to be accepted in categories fro now on=2C I would offer m=
y own advice. Do not write anything likely to create (further) divisions in=
  categories. To mathematics=2C respond only with mathematics. Personal rema=
rks - even if laudatory=2C ought to be forbidden.=A0

Although a response to a published posting=2C the moderator should reject t=
his message. I would understand it perfectly!

Best wishes=2C

Marta
