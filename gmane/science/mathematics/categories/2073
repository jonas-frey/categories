I don't know quite what Peter's point is here: there is no difference between
the spoken forms of "2-categories" and "two-categories". I think we all write
"2-categories", as we write "n-categories" and "w-categories", where I am
making-do with "w" for a lower-case Greek omega. Yet Blackwell, Power, and I,
when we considered general questions about the algebras for 2-monads and the
various kinds of strict and non-strict morphisms of these and some adjunctions
between the 2-categories that arise, entitled our paper "Two-dimensional monad
theory". I don't think "2-monad theory" would have represented our concerns as
well, being capable of interpretation as meaning a wider study than ours, or a 
narrower one, depending on how it was taken by the reader. To the Australian
Research Council, such work is described as research on two-dimensional
universal algebra.

What do others think?
