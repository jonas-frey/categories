Proposals should include: =0A=
=0A=
- A short scientific summary and justification of the proposed topic. =0A=
   This should include a discussion of the particular benefits of the =0A=
   topic to the LICS community. =0A=
- A discussion of the proposed format and agenda. =0A=
- The proposed duration, which is typically one day (two-day =0A=
