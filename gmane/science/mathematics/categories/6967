Vasili,

Certainly---we'll be happy to do this for anybody who is interested.  =
Looks like I need to start a list.

I might mention again that we're leaning heavily on the work of Johnson =
and Rosebrugh.  Just for the record, though, any problems with anything =
we generate are strictly our own doing.  We're having to translate  =
adjunctions into software methods for generating the functors we need, =
and then the colimit theorem into software so we can generate ontologies =
as colimits in Cat.

Regards again,
Mike
