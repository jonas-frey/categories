Certainly Farmelo's book gives that impression - Dirac wasn't exactly
warm and cuddly.  But I'd say that from my experience with
mathematicians, there's no reason to assert that one cannot be both a
good mathematician and a good human being - but maybe that's just
because most mathematicians I know are category theorists ...

... (there are exceptions, of course) ...
