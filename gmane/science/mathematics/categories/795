Well, after reading the various replies, I concede that I was very likely
wrong about cohomolohy (which is generally accepted as the first co-)
being short for contra-homology.  Therefore, complementary homology seems
the best.  Then people started thinking of it as covariant homology
anyway.  Then the idea took hold that co-meant opposite.  Strange, since
now it has essentially reversed meaning.  That's how the language
developes.  It is through such twists and turns that the same
Indo-european root come to mean black in English and white in French (and
other romance languages).  

A few other comments.  The x- and y-coordinates are (or used to be) called
ordinate and abscissa (or vice versa).  For what it's worth.  I know what
efficient means, but I have no idea what it has to do with coefficient.
It stands to reason that Birkhoff & Mac Lane is the opposite of Mac Lane &
Birkhoff.  I hadn't noticed that, but I sure had noticed that I had no
simple way of recalling which were left and which were right cosets.  And
would products be left limits or right limits and why?
