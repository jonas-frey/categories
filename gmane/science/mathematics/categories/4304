The Replacemnt axiom which Colin formulated in his article in Phil.Math.
only works for well-pointed categories. But even in this framework it is
too strong due to its requirement that every external family arises from an
internal one. So it fails for example for the model of ETCS arising from
a countable model of ZFC because there are only countably many internal
families over N whereas there uncountable many external families indexed
by (the global elements of) N.
A defect of the work from the 70ies (Cole, Osius at.al.) is that it just proves
equiconsistency of ETCS and bZ (bounded Zermelo set theory) and not an
equivalence between models of ETCS and bZ.

I think that the more interesting question is what is a model of intuitionistic
set theoy which cannot be well-pointed. For this purpose it is INDISPENSIBLE
to have in our category an object U of all sets.
This was first recognized and formulated by Christian Maurer in his paper
"Universes in Topoi" which appeared in the SLNM volume "Model theory and topoi"
(ed. Lawvere, Maurer, Wraith). Maurer was working in a topos and postulated an
object U (a "universe") of this topos with ext : U >-> P(U) satisfying a few
axioms which ensure that U is a model for IZF (without saying so).
In particular, he has a clear formulation of the axiom of replacement, namely

    (\forall a : U) (\forall f : U^{ext(a)}) (\exists b : U)

        (\forall y : U) (y \in ext(b) <-> (\exists x \in ext(a)) y = f(x))

albeit in a somewhat less readable since he avoids the internal language
of the topos.

This point of view was taken up later in the Algebraic Set Theory (AST) of
Joyal and Moerdijk whose work concentrated on CONTRUCTING (initial) universes
of this kind. A couple of years later Alex Simpson in his LiCS'99 paper took
up Maurer's early insight (at least he refers to Maurer's paper) but weakened
the ambient category to be a model for first order logic (as set theorists do).
The main new ingredient of AST (and Alex's paper) is the assumption of a class
of small maps giving (cum grano salis) a notion of "size" (like B'enabou's
calibrations but satisfying much stronger axioms) together with a notion of
small powerset functor P_s (depending on the class of small maps). A universe
is then defined as a(n initial) fixpoint U of P_s which, of course, can't be
small itself.

A point which seems to have been overlooked in this latest discussion is
that Replacement per set is not very strong. It gets its usual strength only
in presence of unbounded separation. See the paper by Awodey, Butz, Simpson
and me which appeared in last year's Bull.Symb.Logic (see also
http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/als/Research/Sources/set-models-announce.pdf)
where we discuss this in more detail. The point is that around every topos
EE one can build a category of classes whose small "set" part is equivalent
to EE. The corresponding class theory BIST is thus conservative over topos
logic (with nno).

Later on Awodey and his students have also studied the much weaker "predicative"
case where replacement still holds. See also Aczel and Rathjen's work on CZF
in this context which is much older than AST dating back to articles by Aczel
in the late 70ies (and based on previous work by John Myhill).
