David,

To my mind there are three presentations of a "theory" of probability. Two
arrive at essentially the same theory by somewhat different means; these are
frequentist and Bayesian presentations of "standard" probability theory. The
third comes from a completely different direction: quantum mechanics. i
remember when i first encountered the Dirac presentation of QM and the
interpretation of <a| M |b> as a probability amplitude. My first thought was
-- hang on, doesn't that come with an obligation to prove that this aligns
with (satisfies the axioms of) a theory of probability. In attempting to
work that out for myself, i realized that it didn't; discovered a whole
cottage industry of people who had made a similar observation; and argued to
myself that of the various notions of probability put forward, this one
enjoyed being rigourously employed in physical calculations verified to many
decimal places.

Best wishes,

--greg
