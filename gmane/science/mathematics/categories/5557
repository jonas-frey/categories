Dear Dusko,

Thanks. This is interesting, did the Hyland/Moerdijk manuscript you
cite ever appear?

However, maybe I should have phrased my question as:
Barr's theorem has an interesting logical corollary.
This corollary has been used (impressively) by people like Mulvey,
Vermeulen and Wraith to obtain mathematical results.

I understood that it was suggested that a similar use has been made of
descent theory.
Maybe I misunderstood.

Best,

Bas
