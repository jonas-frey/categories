The 10th workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL) will take place at =
ICFO in Castelldefels, Barcelona between 17th and 19th JULY 2013.

WEBPAGE: http://qit.icfo.es/qpl/index.html

This workshop will bring together researchers working on mathematical =
foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing and spatio-temporal =
causal structures, and in particular those that use logical tools, =
ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages, =
semantical methods and other computer science methods for the study of =
physical behaviour in general.  Previous QPL events were held in Ottawa =
(2003), Turku (2004), Chicago (2005), Oxford (2006),Reykjavik (2008), =
Oxford (2009), Oxford (2010), Nijmegen (2011), and Brussels (2012).

The invited speakers confirmed so far are:
Antonio Acin (ICFO, Barcelona)=E2=80=A8
Yves Lafont (l'Universite d'Aix-Marseille, France)=E2=80=A8
Peter Selinger (Dalhousie University, Canada)

Important Dates:
Submission Deadline: 17th May
=E2=80=A8Notification of Acceptance: 7th June=E2=80=A8
Papers Ready: 28th June

Submissions:
Prospective speakers are invited to submit a contribution to the =
workshop. We are considering two kinds of contributions.
 	1.	Short contributions consisting of a 3 page description =
of the work, and a link to a paper published elsewhere.
 	2.	Longer original contributions consisting of a 5-12 page =
extended abstract which provides sufficient evidence of results of =
genuine interest and provides sufficient detail to allow the program =
committee to assess the merits of the work.=20
Submissions of works in progress are encouraged but must be more =
substantial than a research proposal.  Submissions should be prepared =
using LaTeX, and must be submitted in PDF format, and can be done via =
