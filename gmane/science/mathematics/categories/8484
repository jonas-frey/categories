Sad news yet again.

Only a year and a half ago, late in June of 2013, we were mourning =

Aurelio Carboni, at a Conference in his memory organized in Milano =

by none other than his friend and colleague Bob Walters. And now, =

far sooner than any of us would have wished, time has culled Bob =

himself from our earthly stage.

In Milano on June 26, 2013, at that Carboni memorial conference, I =

snagged a few pictures of Bob -- and of Lawvere p=E8re et fils -- using,
alas, just a simple cell phone camera. May I offer them as tribute to =

Bob's memory? -- =


: http://tlvp.net/~fej.math.wes/Milano-2013/index.htm .

And may I offer as well the URL of Bob's Insubria vita page:

: http://www.uninsubria.eu/research/dsat/cv_Walters.htm .

Sadly, -- Fred Linton

[PS: I'll gladly correct any infelicity in the posted date =

31.01.2015 if it's called to my attention. Thanks. -- FEJ] =
