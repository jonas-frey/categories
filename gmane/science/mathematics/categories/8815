Dear Prof Erklund,=0A=
=0A=
The usefulness of category theory is best seen in mathematics.=0A=
Mathematics is part of the real world.=0A=
=0A=
Category theory has applications to algebra, geometry, topology, =0A=
homotopy theory, algebraic-topology, algebraic-geometry, number theory, =0A=
combinatorics, logic, etc.=0A=

Subject: categories: Categories in real world applications=0A=
=0A=
If you know of any real world applications of category theory, please=0A=
let me know. I would be interested to know of clearly described=0A=
applications rather that anticipated ones using categories in background=0A=
theories.=0A=
=0A=
When we speak about "applications of categories" or "applied categories"=0A=
we mostly or almost exclusively mean applying categories within=0A=
mathematics (or theoretical computer science), where we have categories=0A=
in algebra, topology, logic (and type theory), and so on. We do have=0A=
real world applications of algebra, topology, logic, and many other=0A=
branches of mathematics, but possible use of categories is then hidden=0A=
and/or indirect.=0A=
=0A=
Therefore the question: Are categories applicable in the real world?=0A=
=0A=
Application areas could be found within the public or private sectors.=0A=
In the public sector it can be e.g. within education and health, and in=0A=
the private sector in can be e.g. within energy, finance and=0A=
manufacturing.=0A=
=0A=
If I receive more than just a few replies, I will make a survey of it,=0A=
and later on inform the mailing list about the survey.=0A=
=0A=
Looking forward.=0A=
