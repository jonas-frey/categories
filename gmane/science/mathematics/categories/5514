Dear Andre,

the quickest reference I can find is the very incomplete page

http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal+category+in+a+monoidal+category

but more importantly, the thesis referenced there. As I remark at the
above page, Ross Street would know something about this.

As to the other idea, someone (Toby Bartels perhaps) once said that
explicitly equipping 'sets' with a notion of when elements are equal
goes back to Cantor. I find thinking of the undergraduate (or high
school) definition of equality of functions |R --> |R as a pale shadow
of the idea of preset. Consider the collection of expressions denoting
functions (even restricting to polynomials), this is a preset with the
equality relation given by when one algebraic expression gives the
same function as another algebraic expression.

Best,

David Roberts
