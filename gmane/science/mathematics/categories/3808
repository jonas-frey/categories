NEW JUNIOR RESEARCH POSITIONS IN MATHEMATICS AT IST

The Center for Mathematical Analysis, Geometry, and Dynamical Systems
of Instituto Superior Tecnico plans to open soon 4 research positions
in mathematics in one of the areas in which the faculty of the Center
is currently active, privileging the following: differential
equations and dynamical systems (3 maximum); geometry and topology
(including string theory and mathematical-physics) (3 maximum). All
positions are for a period of 5 years, subject to annual evaluations.

The Center is a research and scientific training unit of Instituto
Superior Tecnico (http://www.ist.utl.pt/). It was established in 1991
and develops its activity in mathematics with special emphasis on
nonlinear analysis, dynamical systems, geometry, and topology.

The applicants should hold a Ph.D. in Mathematics or in a related
area relevant to the scientific interests of the faculty of the
Center, for at least 3 years. They must have a strong curriculum and
show a very strong research promise.

Details about these new positions and how to apply will be available
soon in the Center's web page:

	http://camgsd.math.ist.utl.pt.

The expected application deadline for this program is August 31st, 2007.
