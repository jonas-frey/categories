I was sorry not to be at the Calais meeting the other week and had hoped
to have the paper=20

Aspects of slice stability in Locale Theory

=20

http://www.christophertownsend.org/Documents/SliceStability_v30.pdf

=20

ready for it.=20

=20

This paper proves that a particular axiomatic approach to locale theory
is slice stable and then uses this slice stability to prove some known
locale theory/topos theory results.

All the results are known (aside from a conjecture on localic
subgroupoids) so it is really an investigation into this particular
axiomatisation rather than a presentation of new results.=20

It gives what I think is a novel proof of the well known slice stability
result: Loc/Y =3D Loc_Sh(Y).=20

=20

Feedback is welcome. For example, I have always attributed the result
Loc/Y =3D Loc_Sh(Y) to Joyal and Tierney. Am I right?=20
