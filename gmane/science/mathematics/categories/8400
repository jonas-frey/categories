Dear all,

in the TAC reprint 'Comments on the development of topos theory', Lawvere writes

> during that [1973 stay in Buffalo, Grothendieck] also advocated the 
> abandonment of his earlier complicated definition of 'scheme', but 
> unfortunately the simpler alternative he offered does not seem to have 
> found its way into the textbooks

What would this simplified definition be?

Also, reference is made to a document held in Jack Duskin's files made
during this visit. If this document still exists, I would exhort
whoever has it to donate it, or a high-quality scan of it, to the
Grothendieck Circle people. After G's passing, his works have gone
back online, apparently with the permission of his family, see

http://www.grothendieckcircle.org/

Best regards,

David
