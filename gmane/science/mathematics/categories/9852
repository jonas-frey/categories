This may of interest to some of you.

* The workshop will be followed by a day of talks celebrating Steve
Vickers and Giovanni Sambin's retirements last October and you are
invited to attend.

* The workshop forms the middle week of a series of Birmingham Spring
meetings this April, including also the School and Workshop on Univalent
Mathematics, and the Midlands Graduate School in the Foundations of
Computer Science. Participants in 6WFTop may also be interested in the
other two. Links can be found on the website.

* Submissions for contributed talks to 6WFTop are open.

6th Workshop in Formal Topology (6WFTop)

School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham

Mon-Fri 8-12 April 2019.

These workshops date back to 1997, and cover point-free topology,
broadly interpreted, and its logical foundations. There is always a
lively and fruitful interaction between different communities from
mathematics, logic and computer science, and the meetings have proved
fertile ground for developing commonalities between different
foundational approaches such as predicative type theory, toposes and
constructive set theory.

The main parts of the programme are -

* A tutorial day on the Monday around the theme "What is a space?".
Matthieu Anel and Benedikt Ahrens will introduce the ideas of toposes
and univalent type theory.

* Talks from invited speakers: Ingo Blechschmidt, Olivia Caramello,
Maria Manuel Clementino, Tatsuji Kawai, Peter Johnstone and Giovanni
Sambin.

* Contributed talks from other participants - if you wish to offer one,
please email a title and abstract to the organizers, at
s.j.vickers@cs.bham.ac.uk.

Further details are on the workshop web site at

http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/6WFTop/

The workshop is benefiting greatly from generous funding by the London
Mathematical Society and the British Logic Colloquium.

Local organizers: Steve Vickers, Martin Escardo
