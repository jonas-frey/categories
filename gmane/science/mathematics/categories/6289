A group can also be defined as a *semigroup* with that property.
"The inverse" need no longer be "preserved by all morphisms."

Depends what you take to be a bounded lattice. Do you specify *finitary*
meets and joins, including the explicit empty ones that produce the bound=
s?
Or just *binary* ones, with the bounds *required* but not *specified*?
In the former situation, yes, "the complement is preserved by all morphis=
ms."
In the latter situation, alas, no.

When such a "property-like structure" *is* preserved, it is perhaps =

implicitly trying to behave like an "actual" structure, and could
certainly be harmlessly added to the actual structural specifications,
but, with so much riding on the *context* in which one is asking
about that property-like structure, I'm not yet ready just to declare
them, willy-nilly, to be "actual structures".
