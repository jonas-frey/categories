Operads is just another name for signatures (sorts and operators).
Operads emphasize arity a bit more, which might invite operads and
signatures e.g. "over monoidal categories" to try out different paths,
but "over Set" they are the same.

Operads tend to "overlook" the distinction between constant and
variable, as seen e.g. in tree automata.

Anyway, terms (from signatures) have been formally constructed by means
of monads over monoidal categories, but sentence functors are rare.

In predicate calculus, the (informal!) quantifier symbols are
problematic, as they disable a functorial sentence construction. G??del
treats those symbols as formal since they are part of his numbering.
I've often said that self-referentiality is what makes incompleteness
theorems dubious, but treating quantifier symbols as formal ones and
disabling categorical constructions is probably the root of that
"G??del's success story".

The concept of 'theory' in universal algebra (Lawvere theories) and in
generalized logic (Goguen, Meseguer, and as we have generalized it to
fully embrace signatures) is related but not the same.

Let me indeed underline that when terms and sentences are categorically
constructed, they are not just "strings of symbols". Monoids are not
that universal.

Let me also restate that in our developments of these things (including
practical applications) we prefer to say that logic must be 'lative' in
the sense that terms are constructed in order to enable sentence
construction, and so on, and later in that "lative chain" comes
'theory', and many other things making 'logic' a categorical object. In
that category, still to be fully unravelled, morphisms are really
challenging and fascinating.

We feel there is a growing interest in such 'lative' approaches, and we
do invite the CT community to be more curious about such foundational
things.

Best,

Patrik
