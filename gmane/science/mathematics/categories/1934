One thing is clear: your ideal abelian category is not abelian.
Furthermore, you don't get to choose your sub- and quotient objects; they
are imposed by the category.  Moreover, although a weaker topology (or an
abelian group with a weaker topology, which is what I assume is meant) is
certainly a subobject, it is not regular, which every subobject in an
abelian category must be.  In fact, the only abelian categories of
topological abelian groups I am aware of are the discrete groups and the
dual category of compact groups.  For me, the ideal category of
topological abelian groups is SP(LCA), the subobjects of products of
locally compact abelian groups.  It is not abelian, but it is
*-autonomous. It is equivalent to the category of weakly topologized
abelian groups or SP(R/Z), subobjects of powers of the circle.
