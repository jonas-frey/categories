Dear all,

Registration is now open for the workshop History of Formal Methods =
2019. You can see information and accepted talks on the website:=20

   https://sites.google.com/view/hfm2019/home

The area of formal methods is a central part of the theory of computing. =
It grew out of work started in the 1960s to address errors in =
programming, as well as to bring mathematical foundations into =
computing. It has since become an important research area in its own =
right. Some formal methods have pedigrees of more than fifty years; =
others are very recent and will make their professional debuts elsewhere =
at FM=E2=80=9919. Looking back over the history of formal methods shows =
an intriguing research area with a complex intertwining of theory and =
practice; a struggle between academic rigour and practical utility. One =
key motif is a frustrating lack of uptake in industry and an =
ever-increasing arsenal of tools to ease this.

Now is a good time to explore the history of formal methods, to utilise =
the first-hand retrospectives and experiences of ageing researchers who =
participated, and to engage professional historians with the material. =
The topic provides the opportunity to explore questions like the utility =
of science, time versus money versus quality in software engineering, =
relations between industry and academic, and many more. The papers =
submitted to the workshop span a range of topics, including insider =
stories and consideration from the outside.

The workshop should have a mixed audience of both historians and =
technical researchers: a key aim is to get formalists interested in =
their history. In particular, I expect it will be of interest to the =
Applied Category Theory community.=20

The workshop is part of the FM=E2=80=9919 World Congress and =
registration is via that website:=20

   http://formalmethods2019.inesctec.pt/?page_id=3D2363

It is vitally important that all registrants wanting to come to the =
workshop state their intention to attend while registering for FM. This =
should be done by selecting the workshop from the dropdown list if =
registering for just one workshop; or for larger registrations, the free =
text field should be used. If you have already registered for FM=E2=80=991=
9 but did not include this information, please email =
contactfm2019@inesctec.pt.=20

THE EARLY REGISTRATION DEADLINE IS TOMORROW (Tuesday 10th)!

Cheers,
Jeremy
