hi peter,

happy new year! may the daggers over hilbert spaces be the worst evil cast
upon us :)

but i think that this "defense" view of evil suggests that you may be
missing the point.


1) THE PROBLEM OF EVIL

if someone gives you two big complicated hilbert spaces, or two big
complicated groups --- how do you decide whether they are the same? what
does it mean that to be the same group?

well, one thing you could try is to map the elements of one to the
elements of the other one. this may give you an isomorphism.

OR you may look at the actual presentations, say of the group structures
that they gave you, and see whether these are completely equal. if you are
extremely lucky, the two groups may be given by the same equational
presentation. otherwise, if you live in a set theoretic universe, each of
the groups would be given to you as a set, and the two sets can be equal,
or not. in a computer system, each of the groups would be given as a
software module, and they may, or may not be identical as executable
binaries.

the main problem with this is that the various implementation conventions
need to be consistent and interoperable. i think it was peter freyd who
once asked something like: "How can you tell that the set corresponding to
the Monster Group is not the same as the set corresponding to an initial
segment of the number pi?" the same question applies to the binaries, that
may represent an executable group operation, or a piece of data in another
encoding.

note that the problem is NOT a mere philosophic disagreement between a
categorical/structuralist and a set-theoretical/positivist view of math.
it is an eminently PRACTICAL problem of computation.

every crypto system consists of some groups. all these groups are
implemented. some attacks depend on the implementations. other attacks
only depend on the structure of a group, and apply to all implementations.
the latter attacks are more dangerous, but easier to eliminate --- by
avoiding all evil definitions. the former attacks cannot be completely
eradicated: at the end of the day, every new implementation opens some new
avenues of attack.

((the distinction between the evil and the non-evil definitions is
becoming a big deal in cryptography, since mixing them led to some awkward
attacks. eg, one of the most standardized key agreement protocols, ECMQV,
is all in terms picard groups --- and then at one point it suddenly
truncates a key from 160 to 80 bits. which is of course evil. this led to
an attack. and this protocol is "critical for national security" and
brings about $50M annyally just to one company...))

no one is proposing to eradicate evil. like other things in science, evil
is neither good mor bad; it's just there. our goal should be to understand
it.


2) EVIL IN HILBERT SPACES

john baez asked if we can define the dagger structure of FHilb and nCob in
a non-evil way. i think that the structure that i described achieves that
goal.

[[i am sorry if the rest of this gets longer than desirable, but since
peter "dissected" my post, the code of flames requires a clarification.
pls skip or enjoy.]]

the fact that an operation does not transport on the nose does not mean
that it is impossible to find an isomorphic copy that will be preserved.
that is what i proposed.

i am sorry if i am being extremely stupid, but how does this example
differ from saying: "ordered group of integers is equivalent as a poset
with the ordered ring of integers; the latter has multiplication and the
former does not"? what do i learn from the fact that an algebraic
operation (inner product, multiplication...) not specified in a signature,
turns out to be derivable?

sorry: the word "dinaturals" should be omitted. i corrected this after the
original post. i am sorry about the confusion.

if e_X and h_X happen to be dinatural, then P is just the star functor. in
general, all we know about P is that it is a functor whose object part
maps each object to some dual. the duals are determined up to isomorphism;
any will do.

except in the cases when it is, eg in Rel etc.

oh this was nice: people were confused, the confusion got cleared up,
the period of enlightment ensued.

but the story never ends, as we can always refine the picture. the point
of evil is that your first sentence in the above paragraph does not refer
to anything that can be stated in categorical terms. if i give you B and
B*, how do you really know which is which? you look for a star? think
about it: what do you need to be able to really tell when they are equal
and when not?

there is no need for the *chosen* ones. the entire subject of linear
algebra is based on the assumption that every space has *a*
basis. that means that every hilbert space has *a* frobenius
structure. non-canonical, and not preserved by the morphisms of the
category.

this is not true. maybe you used the dinaturality of the initial
(overconstrained) definition P in your calculation.

i don't think that i could have required a *chosen structure* at any
point, even under torture, or coherent transport, or canonical
isomorphisms. all of that is in the eye of the beholder. i was talking
about the actual practice of linear algebra: spaces have bases, the bases
are not unique, nor preserved under the morphisms. in the finite case, the
isomoprhisms B~B* are not natural, but the non-canonical ones are
available when needed. -- my only point was that this can be used to avoid
evil. (this was already used in our work on dagger monoidal
structuralism.)

i would be the last person to suggest that a simple evil structure
should be *replaced* by a less simple non-evil structure. i use evil
as much as everyone else, and more. but it may be useful (and an
interesting exercise) to observe that a particular evil structure may
be isomorphic to something non-evil, and that it can be derived from
it.

sorry again about clogging everyones holiday mailboxes. i hope that peter
and i won't seriously annoy each other. lets stop defending things, or
taking ouresleves too seriously. we do math, and the damage to the
environment is minimal.

and i think i am going to stop posting for a while.

with the very best wishes to all,
