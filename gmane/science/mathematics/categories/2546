Dear colleague,

please notice the deadline for paper submissions of IFIP TCS 2004 has
been redefined. Best regards, -JJ-
----------------------------------------------------------------

                    3RD CALL FOR PAPERS -- TCS 2004

	   3rd IFIP International Conference on Theoretical
	  Computer Science (Foundations of Global Computing)
                  August 23-26, 2004, Toulouse, France

                URL: http://jeanjacqueslevy.net/TCS2004

TCS2004 will be held as part of the IFIP 2004 World Computer Congress.

TCS2004 will be composed of two distinct, but interrelated tracks:
   Track 1  Algorithms, Complexity and Models of Computation,
   Track 2  Logic, Semantics, Specification and Verification.

Submissions are limited to 14 A4 pages, in 11 point or larger font,
LNCS style. The Proceedings will be published by Kluwer, the official
publisher of IFIP.  For detailed information, please visit the web
site.

IMPORTANT DATES

Submission: March 31, 2004 <--------------- NEW DATE
Notification: April 21, 2004

Given the very short delay between the dates for submission and for
notification of acceptance, authors are asked to submit final versions
of their articles. Authors are strongly encouraged to submit papers
before the deadline for submission.

The IFIP TCS2004 conference is sponsored by IFIP TC1 on Foundations of
Computer Science in cooperation with SIGACT, EATCS and INRIA. The IFIP
World Computer Congress has 60 grants of 500 euros each which can be
awarded to students presenting a paper at one of the congress event.
