31st Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics

                  June 22 - 25, 2015

      http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/mfps31/


 		     CALCO 2015

6th International Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science

                  June 24 - 26, 2015

                http://coalg.org/calco15/


           In cooperation with ACM SIGLOG

                 Nijmegen, Netherlands

==========================================================

        Early registration deadline:    June 14, 2015

==========================================================

-- SCOPE --

MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic,
and computer science that are related to models of computation, in
general, and to the semantics of programming languages, in
particular. The series has particularly stressed providing a forum
where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and
exchange ideas about problems of common interest. As the series also
strives to maintain breadth in its scope, the conference strongly
encourages participation by researchers in neighbouring areas.

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with
interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging
uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science.
It is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces
and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic
Methods in Computer Science), and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic
Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in
Swansea (Wales, 2005), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Udine (Italy, 2009),
Winchester (UK, 2011) and Warsaw (Poland, 2013).

-- LOCATION --

Nijmegen is the oldest city in the Netherlands and celebrated its
2,000th year of existence in 2005. It is situated in the eastern
province of Gelderland, quite near to the German border. The latin
name for Nijmegen, `Noviomagus??, is a reminder of its Roman past.
`Noviomagus?? means `new market?? and refers to the right to hold a
market as granted by the Romans. In the days of Charlemagne, the
city was called `Numaga??; later on, this became `Nieumeghen?? and
`Nimmegen??. However, citizens born and bred in Nijmegen speak
affectionately of `Nimwegen??.

Nijmegen is one of the warmest cities of the Netherlands, especially
during summer, when the highest temperatures in the country are
usually measured in the triangle Roermond ??? Nijmegen ??? Eindhoven.
The lack of north-south oriented mountain ranges in Europe make this
area prone to sudden shifts in weather, giving the region a
semi-continental climate.

Conference venue for MFPS/CALCO is the majestic *Art Cinema Lux*
(http://lux-nijmegen.nl/), located in the city center of Nijmegen.


-- SIGLOG Anti-harassment Policy --

The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression
are central to the values and goals of SIGLOG. They require an
environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and
group. They flourish in communities that foster mutual understanding
and embrace diversity. For these reasons, SIGLOG is committed to
providing a harassment-free conference experience, and implements the ACM
policy against harassment (see http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/officers_manual/anti-harassment-policy).

Conference participants violating these standards may be sanctioned or
expelled from the meeting, at the discretion of the conference
organizers. Conference organizers are requested to report serious
incidents to the SIGLOG Chair.
