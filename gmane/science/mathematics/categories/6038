I should also have said that the universal property - though not the
notion of "commuting S,T-algebra" in the form I stated it - did appear
in the paper Combining algebraic effects with continuations, by
Hyland, me, Plotkin and Power.

Sorry for forgetting this, it's been a while.

Also, the proof of Theorem 4 (and also that of Prop. 3) is similar to
the one you provided, although the result is somewhat different.
