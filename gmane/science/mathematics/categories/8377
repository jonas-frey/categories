Dear David,

The short answer is: the inverse image functor f*:F -> E preserves NNO.

The argument goes as follows: an NNO is an initial (1+)-algebra, that
is, initial for the endofunctor [X] -> [1+X]. Since f* preserves 1 and
+, it induces an isomorphism f*(1+) = (1+_)f*, which in turn induces a
functor

(f*)-alg: (1 +)- alg -> (1+)-alg

Fact (++): The right adjoint f_* induces a right adjoint to f*-alg

Hence (f*)-alg preserves initial objects, aka, NNO.

The Fact (++) can be easily calculated, but a more formal argument is
given as Thm A.5 in

Hermida, Claudio, and Bart Jacobs. "Structural induction and coinduction
in a fibrational setting." Information and Computation 145.2 (1998):
107-152.

Regards,

Claudio
