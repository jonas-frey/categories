I think Michael Makkai has done it.  He has formulated a foundational
approach to mathematics based on infinity-categories, in which equality
plays no fundamental role:

http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/mltomcat04/mltomcat04.pdf

I think some approach along these general lines might ultimately become
quite popular.  However, to think in an easy intuitive way about a
mathematical world without equality, we need new definitions of words such
as "the" and "is". Those who find it unpleasant to change the definition of
words such as "autonomous" may think it absurd to consider a such a radical
shift in basic terminology. However, we can already see these words changing
their meanings as we pass from reasoning within sets - where we say "the"
product 2 x 3 "is" 6 - to reasoning within categories - where we say "the"
product of "the" 2-element set and "the" 3-element set "is" "the" 6-element
set.

For a readable introduction to some of Makkai's ideas, try:
