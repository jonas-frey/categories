Dear Anne:

My sincere condolences on Myles's death.  Myles was one of the first 
people I met when I arrived at Columbia in the fall of 1962.  Others were 
George Rinehart, Jon Beck, Fred Linton, Steve Schanuel, all now gone. 
But I really got to know him in Zurich in 1967.  I was, and still am, 
impressed by his mathematical accomplishments.

Myles had a hard life.  First his fall from a cliff, then losing one child 
(already unimaginable), then the second one, then his recent illness. 
But he bore it all with stoicism and grace.  A real loss.

Michael
