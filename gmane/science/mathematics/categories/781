I would guess that the oldest use of co- in mathematics is to mean
"complement of an angle", as in cosine, cotangent, etc.  Encyclopedia
Britannica dates these to 1635. This would be an early justification
of using co- in the sense of "opposite".

The word "complement" itself comes from Latin "complere": to fill up.

The use of co- in the sense of "together, joint" is much more
widespread in everyday language, in words such as coauthor and
coconspirator (notice how the last example is curiously redundant).
This is also the origin of words such as coordinate (1641),
coefficient (ca. 1715), and collinearity (1863).

Best wishes, -- Peter
