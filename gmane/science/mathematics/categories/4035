Have you seen this problem yourself?  I've been unable to duplicate it
on either Linux or Windows XP, using free Acrobat Reader 8.1.1 dated
August 20 on both platforms.  I put all five ligatures in a latex file
and compiled it directly to pdf with pdflatex, then as a double check
indirectly with latex to dvi then to ps with dvips then to pdf with
ps2pdf.  On XP I did this with the latex that comes with Cygwin, on
Linux with the latex that comes with Redhat FC4 (old system I haven't
upgraded for a while).

Is the problem independent of font?  Of dvi-to-pdf converter?  Of
operating system?   Etc, etc.
