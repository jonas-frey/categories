Am I right in thinking this to be Idl N, the ideal completion of the
natural numbers (with their usual order)?

I conjecture that this is a suitable value domain for the ranks of matrices
over localic fields such as the reals: rank^-1{n} is not open, but
rank^-1{n, n+1, n+2, ...} is. Then rank A is the set of natural numbers n
such that we can find enough apartnesses to prove linear independence of n
rows of A, and this is an ideal of N - the definition also smoothly
incorporates infinite matrices.

(Perhaps this is just one of the things that have have been discussed for
25 years and I'm reiventing it.)

Anyway, I have investigated Idl N as a fixpoint object (in the sense of
Crole and Pitts) in the category of Grothendieck toposes (modulo
2-categorical niceties that I didn't investigate too closely) in a paper
"Topical Categories of Domains".
