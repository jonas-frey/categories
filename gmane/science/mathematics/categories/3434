                             CALL FOR PAPERS

                                   MFPS XXIII
               <http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/mfps23.htm>

                      Twenty-third Conference on the
                        Mathematical Foundations of
                           Programming Semantics

                                Tulane University
                             New Orleans, LA USA
                                April 11 - 14, 2007

             Partially Supported by US Office of Naval Research


The Twenty-third Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics (MFPS XXIII) will take place on the campus of
Tulane University, New Orleans, LA USA from Wednesday, April 11
through Saturday, April 14, 2007.

The MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics,
logic, and computer science which are related to models of
computation, in general, and to the semantics of programming
languages, in particular. The series has particularly stressed
providing a forum where researchers in mathematics and computer
science can meet and exchange ideas about problems of common
interest.  As the series also strives to maintain breadth in its
scope, the conference strongly encourages participation by
researchers in neighboring areas.

The INVITED SPEAKERS for MFPS XXIII are

       Gerard Berry (Esterel Technologies)
       --- to be confirmed ---

       Stephen Brookes (CMU)

       Jane Hillston (Edinburgh)

       John Mitchell (Stanford)

       Gordon Plotkin (Edinburgh)

       John Power (Edinburgh)

In addition, there will be three special sessions:

    1. A special session honoring GORDON PLOTKIN on his 60th birthday
       year, organised by Samson Abramsky (Oxford).

    2. A special session on SECURITY, organised by Catherine Meadows
(NRL).

    3. A special session on SYSTEMS BIOLOGY, organised by Jane
       Hillston (Edinburgh) and Prakash Panangaden (McGill).

   4.  A Special Session on Physics, Information and Computation
        organized by Keye Martin (NRL).

Further, there will be a TUTORIAL DAY on April 11.  The topic will be
Domain Theory; the speakers will be announced at a later date.  This
event will be free to those who are interested in attending.

The remainder of the program will consist of papers selected by the
following PROGRAM COMMITTEE

    Samson Abramsky (Oxford)                       Michael Mislove
(Tulane)
    Andrej Bauer (Ljubljana)                            John Mitchell
(Stanford)
    Stephen Brookes (CMU)                             Eugenio Moggi
(Genova)
    Pierre-Louis Curien (CNRS & Paris 7)     Laurent Regnier (Marseille)
    Andrzej Filinski (Copenhagen)                  Giuseppe Rosolini
(Genova)
    Marcelo Fiore (Cambridge), CHAIR          Davide Sangiorgi (Bologna)
    Achim Jung (Birmingham)                           Philip Scott
(Ottawa)
    Masahito Hasegawa (Kyoto)                       Daniele Varacca
(Paris 7)

(Oxford)
    Catherine Meadows (NRL)                          Steve Zdancewic
(Pennsylvania)
