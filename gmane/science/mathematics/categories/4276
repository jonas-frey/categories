Maybe not the walls of mathematics, but what about theorems like "every
polynomial functor on Set has a unique initial algebra whose structure map
is an identity"?  I think theorems like this are worth retaining (and
antifoundation makes even more of them).

I'd also like to suggest that "foundations" is being used in two very
different senses.  In FoM, it's about quantifying the philosophical risks
involved in particular formal systems and proofs, i.e. issues such as
relative consistency, omega-consistency, etc.  For this purpose the
primacy of membership vs composition is quite immaterial. One could, I
suppose, make a formal theory based on composition equal in strength (in
whatever sense) to ZF.

Category theory on the other hand is about fundamental algebraic
structures.  I don't think it makes sense to ask "is category theory
omega-consistent?" as one can for ZF (not that anyone knows the answer).
