We are pleased to announce again the programme "Mathematical Structures
of Computation" organised in Lyon, from January 13th to February 14th,
2014.

The programme proposes five consecutive workshops

    1. Recent Developments in Type Theory, January 13-17.

    2. Algebra and Computation, January 20-24.

    3. Directed Algebraic Topology and Concurrency, January 27-31.

    4. Formal Proof, Symbolic Computation and Computer Arithmetic,
February 3-7.

    5. Concurrency, Logic and Types, February 10-14.

Information on the programme can be found at

                     http://smc2014.univ-lyon1.fr

The program of the workshops 3-4-5  is partially open ; please feel

Financial support for PhD students and postdocs for accomodation is
available upon request to organiser of each workshop, deadline to apply
for financial support is October 31 2013.

The weeks Mathematical Structures of Computation are organised in Lyon
with the support of the Labex MILYON - Mathematics and fundamental
computer science in Lyon.

Together with the trimester Semantics of proofs and certified
mathematics organised at Institut Henri Poincar=E9, Paris
(http://ihp2014.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr) they constitute a French
Semester on certified mathematics, programming languages and the
mathematical structures of computation.

The organisers
Patrick Baillot, Yves Guiraud, Philippe Malbos.
