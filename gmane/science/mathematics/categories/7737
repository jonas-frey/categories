Such an approach has recently been developed here:

Univalent categories and the Rezk completion
Benedikt Ahrens, Chris Kapulkin, Michael Shulman
---
     We develop category theory within Univalent Foundations, which is
a foundational system for mathematics based on a homotopical
interpretation of dependent type theory. In this system, we propose a
definition of "category" for which equality and equivalence of
categories agree. Such categories satisfy a version of the Univalence
Axiom, saying that the type of isomorphisms between any two objects is
equivalent to the identity type between these objects; we call them
"saturated" or "univalent" categories. Moreover, we show that any
category is weakly equivalent to a univalent one in a universal way.
In homotopical and higher-categorical semantics, this construction
corresponds to a truncated version of the Rezk completion for Segal
spaces, and also to the stack completion of a prestack.
