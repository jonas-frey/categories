[Note from moderator: Prof. Benabou's recent posts have been forwarded as 
received by the list. Everyone is reminded of the list policy at: 
http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/ ]

In order to stay simple I shall consider only the case where the =
2-category with comma objects and 2-pullbacks is Cat, and I shall even =
accept the axiom of universes and AC.

In that case, but only in that case, the Grothendieck construction makes =
sense and the theorem, proved by Grothendieck himself, stating that =
indexed categories and fibered ones are 2-equivalent is, of course, =
correct.
Nevertheless, as Dubuc points out, Grothendieck discarded indexed =
categories for fibrations, and neither he nor his school ever used =
indexed categories.
For ages, I have tried to convince people, in particular on this mailing =
list, that indexed categories ought to  be abandoned, not only because =
of the authority of Grothendieck, but for mathematical reasons which I =
explained, and I wrote the paper in the Journal of Symblic Logic  (JSL) =
to explain my views.
This had no effect, and sometimes got me a lot of abuse. In particular =
the JSL paper was qualified as a pamphlet, and I still consider it as =
the deepest paper I ever wrote. That is why I dedicated it to =
Grothendieck.
I'm glad to see that in the discussion, only fibrations were considered, =
and such notions  as fibrations with internal sums and products, which I =
introduced, were used.

So far, I have had no reaction from Bill Lawvere who introduced indexed =
categories, and whose influence determined the wrong choice of indexed =
versus fibered made by many people.
More surprisingly, no reaction either from Peter Johnstone who made in =
the Elephant a complete mess of the whole question. I hope he will give =
his opinion.

I would like to thank Ross Street for his answer, and make a few =
comments on his notion of non evil fibration to answer a question asked =
by Steve Vickers which I quote:

But that seems to claim that in Cat it doesn't matter whether you use =
iso or  equality in the Chevalley condition. Does that accord with your =
understanding?

I disagree totally with the claim.=20

Take C =3D Cat, with all the strong conditions I recalled at the =
beginning.
I can prove that any functor  p: E -> B  , where  B is a groupoid,  is =
both a fibration and an op-fibration in the sense of Street.

Let us see some  special cases.
Let B be a groupoid. Take b an object of B,  E an arbitrary category and =
for  p: E --> B  the constant functor with value b.  you get a Street =
bifibration with all fibers empty except the fiber over b, which can be =
chosen arbitrary.
By taking for E a coproduct, you can even have a Street bifibration =
having over each object of B an arbitrary fiber,  with all these fibers =
totally unrelated.=20
You can even assume the groupoid B to be connected. (In that case, for a =
Grothendieck fibration all the fibers are isomorphic)
How does this example fit with the geometrical picture evoked by the =
word fibration?=20

In view of this example I suggest that the name of fibrations should be =
used exclusively for Grothendieck fibrations, the usual ones or their =
internalizations along the lines I described, and another name, e.g. =
weak fibrations, be given to the notion defined by Street.
Woud you agree with this, Ross ?

I apologize for sending this mail individually to many people, but it =
seems that, for reasons unknown, my previous mail has not been forwarded =
by the category list. I hope this one will be but I prefer to be on the =
safe side as I hope to get a few reactions.

Thanks to all for your  patience.

Jean
