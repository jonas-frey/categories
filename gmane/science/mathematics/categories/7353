This year ICFP will host a Student Research Competition where
undergraduate and postgraduate students can present posters. The
SRC at the ICFP 2012 consists of three rounds:

  - Extended abstract round: All students are encouraged to submit an
extended abstract outlining their research (800 words).

  - Poster session at ICFP 2012: Based on the abstracts, a panel
of judges will select the most promising entrants to participate
in the poster session which will take place at ICFP. Students who
make it to this round will be supported to attend the conference,
to a maximum of $500 for travel and housing.  If your total costs
are higher than these $500 your conference fee may be waived too.
In the poster session, students will have the opportunity to
present their work to the judges, who will select three finalists
in each category* (graduate/undergraduate) to advance to the next
round.

  - ICFP presentation: The next round consists of an oral
presentation at the ICFP to compete for the final awards in each
category.

** Prizes **

Both the top three graduate and the top three undergraduate contestants
will receive prizes of $500, $300, and $200, respectively.  All six
winners will receive award medals and a two-year complimentary ACM
student membership, including a subscription to ACM=92s Digital
Library. The names of the winners will be posted on the SRC web
site.

The winners in each category will be invited to participate in
the ACM SRC Grand Finals, an on-line round of competitions among the
winners of other conference-hosted SRCs. Grand Finalists and their
advisors will be invited to the Annual ACM Awards Banquet for an
all-expenses-paid trip, where they will be recognized for their
accomplishments along with other prestigious ACM award winners,
including the winner of the Turing Award (also known as the Nobel
Prize of Computing). The top three graduate Grand Finalists will
receive an additional $500, $300, and $200. Likewise, the top three
undergraduate Grand Finalists will receive an additional $500, $300,
and $200. All six Grand Finalists will receive Grand Finalist
certificates.

** Eligibility **

The SRC is open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Upon
submission, entrants must be enrolled as a student at their
university.

The abstract must describe the student=92s individual research and must
be authored solely by the student. If the work is collaborative with
others and/or part of a larger group project, the abstract should make
clear what the student=92s role was and should focus on that portion of
the work. The extended abstract must not exceed 800 words and must not
be longer than 2 pages. The reference list does not count towards
these limits. To submit an abstract, please register through the
submission page and follow the instructions. Abstracts submitted after
the deadline may be considered at the committee's discretion, but only
after decisions have been made on all abstracts submitted before the
deadline. If you have any problems, don't hesitate to contact the
competition chair. More information about the submission process can
be found online at: http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2012/src.html
