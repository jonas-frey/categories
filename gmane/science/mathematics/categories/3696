Very interesting! I was aware that one could
construct such comonadic adjunctions in a limited
variety of other cases, but that one can do so for
essentially any pair of presheaf categories is (at
least to me) a little surprising.

Of course, even in the case where C and D have the
same objects, there is nothing "canonical" about
the comonadic adjunction [C, Set] -| [D, Set] which
we construct in the way Peter has indicated, since
we have first to choose a bijection between the
objects of C and the objects of D.
