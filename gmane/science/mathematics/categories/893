Dear Carlos

Comma categories are explained, for example, in Mac Lane's book "Categories
for the working mathematician" Grad Texts in Math #5 (Springer). In a sense
they are "lax pullbacks" defined when given two functors with the same
codomain. Hence, just as we can carry over the notion of pullback in Set to
any category, we can carry over, by representability, the notion of comma
category from Cat to any 2-category (I call them comma objects in SLNM
420).

Exaggerating only slightly, the whole reason enriched category theory got
going in the 60s was to deal with the example of differential graded
categories: these are categories enriched in chain complexes
(Eilenberg-Kelly "Closed categories" LaJolla 1965).  As I understand it,
that example prompted Sammy and Max to their joint work: they had each used
DG-categories before.

My thesis [0] was not published in full. For the published papers [2], [5]
on the thesis, I took out the stuff on DG-categories. However, [25] uses
the DG-category approach very strongly and gives new proofs of more general
results (I had some of these at the time of my thesis but hadn't included
them). The papers provide universal coefficients (or homotopy
classification) theorems for diagrams of chain complexes.
