Dear Category Theorists -

I regret doing this interview, and I'll be more careful about who I talk
to in the future.  More importantly, some companies are starting to hire
people in applied category theory.  Whether this continues will depend
on what these people do.   But for now, we can expect some articles
about category theory in business-related publications, typically written
by people who don't know anything about category theory.   Other
branches of science are more used to this.

By the way, I didn't see these posts until someone told me about them,
because I use gmail, and gmail declared them to be spam - probably
because they claim to come from someone's address, but they come
from another address (categories@mta.ca).   I've told gmail that
no email from categories@mta.ca is spam.   If you use a service that
aggressively blocks spam, you might want to look in your spam box
for posts from this list!

Best,
jb
