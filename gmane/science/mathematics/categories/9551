Dear Community,

I have updated my website with a pdf of a draft translation into English of=
  parts of SGA4(*). This was done nearly a decade ago, but was not of intere=
st to publishers at the time. I hope it is of some interest.

The reason for me recalling this piece of work is that I thought someone ha=
d mentioned the humorous exercise =917) Buy the editor a chocolate medal=92=
  on this list  few months ago. (This had led my assistant translator to inc=
lude his own wry comment, which you will see at the end as an additional fo=
otnote if you take a look.)

Regards to all,

Christopher
