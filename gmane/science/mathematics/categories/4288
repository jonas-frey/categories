Very interesting!  But I don't think that is the answer to the
question I intended to ask, although perhaps I phrased the question
poorly.  As far as I can tell, you give a way of interpreting
replacement/collection in such a way that it is satisfied in all
toposes, by "constructivizing" the existential quantifier.  But as you
say, "In consequence, the standard arguments using Replacement that
take one outside of V_\lambda(A) for \lambda non-inaccessible, are not
reproducible."  What I would really like to know is, can one formulate
an elementary property of a topos which *does* allow one to reproduce
the standard arguments of Replacement?

Here's another way to phrase the same (or a similar) question.
Suppose I meet a mathematician who thinks categorically enough to
dislike the membership-based nature of ZF(C), but doesn't want to give
up any of its consequences.  In particular, he wants to be able to use
transfinite induction beyond \omega+\omega.  For instance, he wants
Borel determinacy to be true, which is provable in ZFC but not in
Zermelo set theory (ZFC minus Replacement).  Is there a categorical
foundation I can tell him to use?  That is, is there an elementary
categorical theory which is as strong as ZF(C)?
