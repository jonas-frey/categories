There was a little but crucial mistake in my mail yesterday. The functors
corresponding to generalized triposes over SS preserves finite limits and
have bound 1.

Implicit in Andy Pitts Thesis (1981) there is a geometric account of a mild
generalisation of triposes. They are equivalent to finite limit preserving
functors F : SS -> EE between toposes for which 1 is a bound, i.e. every object
A of EE appears as subquotient of some FI. In lack of a better name I call
these functors "weakly localic".
My question is whether weakly localic maps are closed under composition?
I guess that not but lack an example. If anyone had a suggestion I'd be
very grateful!
