Keith was a good friend and colleague.  He will be missed greatly.

I agree with Fred and Marco.
Keith Hardie was one of a vanishing breed of true gentlemen.

When I visited Cape Town in the early 1980s, we discovered
we had a common interest in diagrams of interlocking sequences
(so called by TCT (Terry) Wall).
Keith=92s interlocking sequences arose from homotopy groups,
mine from homology.
He kept encouraging me until I wrote up a result I had while writing,
but did not include in, my thesis.
I really enjoyed revisiting that result and improving some techniques.

That first visit to South Africa and an evening at Keith=92s home left a la=
sting impression on me.
We only met a few times after that, the last being CT2009.

It is very sad news, Peter. Please convey my condolences to the family.

Ross
