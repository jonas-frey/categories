Dear colleagues,

Please find below a CfP for HSCC 2016, a conference devoted to
the study of hybrid systems (with both discrete and continuous
dynamics).

The topic might seem out of the scope of the categories list,
but there have been exciting examples of "transfer" of results
and ideas from the discrete world to the hybrid one,
exploiting the abstraction power of the categorical language.
They include [Haghverdi, Tabuada and Pappas,
Theoretical Computer Science, 2005] and [Jacobs, Theoretical
Computer Science, 2000]. I believe there's a chance that
category theory will help making self-driving cars way safer :-)

All the best,
Ichiro Hasuo

Conference Scope

Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC) has long been the
leading, single-track conference on foundations, techniques, and tools
for analysis, verification, control, synthesis, implementation, and
applications of dynamical systems that exhibit continuous and discrete
(hybrid) dynamics. Applications deal broadly with cyber-physical
systems (CPS), and include mixed signal circuits, robotics,
large-scale infrastructure networks, as well as natural systems such
as biochemical and physiological models.

We solicit theoretical as well as applied research papers that present
original work combining ideas from computer science and control
systems. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Design, synthesis, planning and control
- Analysis, automated verification (Boolean or quantitative)
- Certification, validation, and testing
- Model building from data (via learning) and model simulation
- Mathematical foundations, computability and complexity
- Programming languages, specification formalisms
- Software tool engineering and experimentation
- Real-time and resource-aware control
- Network science and control over networks
- Applications in cyber-physical systems, and in particular:
automotive, avionics, energy and power, mobile and autonomous
robotics, medical devices, manufacturing, transportation, systems and
synthetic biology, models for the life sciences, and other areas.

HSCC 2016 will be held as part of the eighth Cyber Physical Systems
Week (CPS Week), alongside the International Conference on
Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS), the International Conference on
Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN), the Real-Time and
Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS), and CPS-related
workshops.

Special Issue: Authors of distinguished papers may be invited to
submit an extended version of their work for possible publication in a
special issue of a leading journal in the CPS research area.

Best Student Paper Award: As established in the previous years, a best
student paper award will be given to a contribution primarily authored
by a student.

Repeatability Evaluation: HSCC has a history of publishing strong
papers emphasising computational contributions; however, subsequent
re-creation of these computational elements is often challenging
because details of the implementation are unavoidably absent in the
paper. Authors of papers accepted to HSCC (in any track) that contain
a computational component will be invited to participate in an
optional repeatability evaluation process after final submission of
the paper in February. Papers that pass will be highlighted at the
conference and in the proceedings, and all submissions will receive
confidential feedback from independent reviewers on any challenges
faced in recreating the computational results. Further details will be
posted at the conference web page.

Submission Guidelines

Submitted papers should present unpublished original research, not
under review elsewhere.

Regular papers: maximum 10 pages in the 10pt, two-column ACM format.

Tool and Case Study papers: maximum 6 pages in the 10pt, two-column
ACM format. Tool Papers should describe an implemented tool and its
novel features. Case studies should present hybrid systems tools or
techniques.

Demo/posters: Maximum 2 pages. Demo/poster descriptions serve the sole
purpose of selecting contributions for the  demo  and  poster  session
  and  will  not  be  published  in  the conference proceedings.

Submissions

Submissions of Regular, Tool and Case-Study papers should be made
through the HSCC 2016 EasyChair submission website:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dhscc2016
Submissions deadline is October 23, 2015 - corresponding abstracts
should be submitted by October 8, 2015.

ACM templates can be found at:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates

Demo/poster submissions: The submission deadline will be announced
sometime in the beginning of 2016. Submission will be through email to
hscc2016@easychair.org with "HSCC demo/poster submission" in the
subject line. Questions should be directed to the same address.
