Even to prove that there is a non-zero injective abelian group needs a
little bit of choice, but only a little.  (By contrast, the statement that
every divisible abelian group is injective is equivalent to the axiom of
choice.)  The details are in my paper "Injectivity, projectivity, and the
axiom of choice" (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 255 (1979) 31--59).
