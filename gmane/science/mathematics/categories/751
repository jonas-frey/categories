CONCUR 98: Purpose and Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers, and students in order to advance the theory
of concurrency, and promote its applications. Interest in this
topic is continuously growing, as a consequence of the importance
 of concurrent systems and their applications, and of the scientific
relevance of their foundations.

The scope of CONCUR'98 covers all areas of semantics, logics, and
verification techniques for concurrent systems.  A list of specific
topics includes (but is not limited to) concurrency related aspects of
models of computation and semantic domains, process algebras, Petri
nets, event structures, real-time systems, hybrid systems,
decidability, model-checking, verification techniques, refinement
techniques, term and graph rewriting, distributed programming, logic
constraint programming, object-oriented programming, typing systems
and algorithms, case studies, tools and environments for programming
and verification.



Venue and local arrangements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nice is ideally located on the French Riviera. September is still very
pleasant, while less crowded than the high season. Nice's
international airport is well-connected to all major european and
non-european cities.

The conference will be held at the auditorium of Nice
Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, which is conveniently located
in the heart of Nice, between the city center and the old town, and 20
minutes walk to the beach. The Museum is next to the Hotel Novotel,
where tutorials, satellite workshops, and registration will be held.


Social programme 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- cocktail offered by the City of Nice at the Modern Art Museum Cafe
- excursion at Cap Ferrat on Thursday 10.
  Cap Ferrat is a beautiful promontory between Nice and Monaco. Its
  attractions include: walks with spectacular views of the coast,
  beaches, Villa Kerylos (a copy of a sumptuous antique Greek house), 
  Ephrussi de Rothchild Foundation, the charming villages of
  St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat and  Beaulieu-sur-Mer. 
- banquet on Thursday 10 (evening) at the  Royal Riviera Hotel of
  St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat (one of the coast's most stylish establishments).
