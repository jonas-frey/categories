3WFTop Second Announcement

THIRD WORKSHOP ON FORMAL TOPOLOGY (3WFTop)

Padua (Italy)

7-8 May 2007 tutorials (Dept. of Math.)
9-12 May 2007 workshop (Accademia Galileiana)
13 May 2007 social excursion (for those who stay)

See the web site http://www.3wftop.math.unipd.it/ for news on:
- submission of papers (deadline March 15)
- registration (early registration before March 31; note that there are some
grants for students and young researchers)
- program (preliminary version)
- accommodation
- social program (see also a photographic tour of Padua)

A copy of the the first announcement follows:

This is the third of a series of successful meetings on the
development of Formal Topology and its connections with
related approaches. The first two have been held in Padua,
1997, and Venice, 2002.

What is formal topology

When topology is developed in a strictly constructive way,
for instance over Martin-Loef's type theory, points cannot be
given primitively and the pointfree approach is fundamental.
This is the reason why it is called formal. Formal topology
has now become an important tool in constructive mathematics.

More on formal topology:

Invited speakers

Invited speakers include Andre' Joyal, Per Martin-Loef and
many other prominent scholars:

Tutorials

Before the workshop, two days of extensive and coordinated
tutorials are planned, given by Bernhard Banaschewski and
other pioneers: http://www.3wftop.math.unipd.it/tutorials.html
