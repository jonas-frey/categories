PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC

        90th meeting - first announcement

Dear Colleagues,

As announced officially at PSSL89 in Louvain-la-Neuve, the 90th
meeting of the seminar will be held at the Department of Theoretical
Computer Science of the Technical University Braunschweig, Germany,
during April 24-25, 2010.  As always, the seminar welcomes talks that
use category theory or logic, either explicitly or implicitly, in the
study of any aspect of mathematics or science.

Braunschweig is located about 60 km East of Hannover and about 200 km
West of Berlin.  It can easily be reached by car or train.  The
closest airport is in Hannover; trains to Hannover's main railway
station take about 17 minutes, and trains from there to
Braunschweig take about 40 minutes or less.

An online registration form can be found at

	http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/TI-INFO/koslowj/PSSL90.html

Further information on the location of the seminar, along with details
on local travel, accommodation etc. will become avilable there by
mid-January.

Best regards,

Jiri Adamek
