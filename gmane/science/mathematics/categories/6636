a friend told me that there was a conference where music critics and =
professors discussed the visual content of music. on the other side, =
there are learned essays about the deep links between music and =
architecture. (hegel in particular wrote about that.)

the question whether a mathematical proof explains the theorem might be =
of a similar kind. while most proofs of the pythagoras theorem do =
explain why it is true, wyles' proof of the great fermat theorem (just a =
slightly different statement) does not seem to be explaining it to too =
many people.

some proofs yield an explanation, some explanations lead to a proof - =
but there is a sense in which the *attitudes* leading to one and to the =
other are *opposite*: while explanations tend to increase the number of =
words in the world, many people prove things so that we can stop talking =
about them.=20

maybe the situation resembles the discussion between zeno and =
parmenides: "as parmenides argued that the movement does not exist in =
the universe, zeno stood up and walked around".
