Dear all=2C
>>
The discussion about the equivalence between the bicategories of anafunctor=
s and of representable distributors=2C due entirely to Benabou as mentioned=
  below=2C has an additional interpretation in terms of stack completions wh=
ich may be of interest to some of you. =A0In what follows=2C S denotes an e=
lementary topos in the sense of Lawvere and Tierney.=A0
>>
The first thing I noticed is that a =A0"representable distributor" from C t=
o D =A0(in the sense of Benabou) is none other than a functor from =A0C to =
D*=2C where D* is the (intrinsic) stack completion of D. =A0This follows fr=
om the characterization of (intrinsic) stack completions given in my paper =
"Stack completions and Morita equivalence for categories in a topos"=2C Cah=
iers de Top. Geom Diff. XX-4 (1979) 404-436. In plain terms=2C my character=
ization says that=2C for any locally internal fibration A over a topos S=2C=
  the stack completion A* of A is obtained as the middle term in the factori=
zation of the Yoneda embedding of A into the category of S-valued presheave=
s on A through its `weakly-essential image'.=A0In the case of a category D =
in a topos S=2C its stack completion is that of the fibration [D] over S=2C=
  =A0called the "externalization" of D in my paper with Bob Pare=2C "Stacks =
and equivalences of indexed categories"=2C Cahiers de Top. Geo. Diff XX-4 (=
1979) 373-399.=A0
>=A0>
In principle then=2C the theory of anafunctors introduced by Michael Makkai=
  (and with which I am not really acquainted) could be recast more simply an=
d to advantage in these terms=2C exploiting for this purpose the universal =
property of stack completions. For categories in S=2C this says that an ana=
functor from C to D is simply a functor from [C] to [D]*. Just as in the ca=
se of anafunctors=2C for a general topos S=2C=A0=A0the fibration [D]* over =
S for a category D in S need not be equivalent to (the externalization [D*]=
  of) an internal category D* in S.=A0=A0
>>
However=2C for a Grothendieck topos S=2C this is the case on account of the=
  existence of a generating set. =A0An alternative construction of the stack=
  completion of a category in S is that of Andre Joyal and Myles Tierney=2C =
"Strong stacks and classifying spaces" in Category Theory=2C Proceedings of=
  Como 1990=2C LNM 1488=2C Springer=2C 213-236=2C 1991=2C by means of a Quil=
len model structure on Cat(S) whose weak equivalences are the weak equivale=
nce functors. =A0This construction applies for instance to a Grothendieck t=
opos S.=A0In particular=2C for S Grothendieck topos=2C there is then an equ=
ivalence between the bicategory of anafunctors in Cat(S) and the Kleisli bi=
category of the stack completion 2-monad on Cat(S). =A0
