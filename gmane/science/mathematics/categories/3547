This would seem to involve  libraries in the business of system
administration.

The CUNY Graduate Center hosts a few online academic journals (e.g.,
http://ojs.gc.cuny.edu/   http://ojs.gc.cuny.edu/index.php/lljournal )
using the Open Journal Systems journal open source
management and publishing system ( URL:  http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs ).
The library here is not involved in either site administration, which
the IT department handles; or the management of the journals--the IT
department delegates this function to the journal editors.
