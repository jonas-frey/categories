Yes, but Aristotle was not known in Europe in the original Greek.  He
was known in Latin until well after the Renaissance, and in vernacular
languages taking their terms from Latin in recent centuries.   The
Online Etymolgical Dictionary gives for English:

Topics: 1634, "argument suitable for debate," singular form of
"Topics" (1568), the name of a work by Aristotle on logical and
rhetorical generalities, from L. Topica,  from Gk. Ta Topika, lit.
"matters concerning topoi," from topoi "commonplaces," neut. pl. of
topikos "commonplace, of a place," from topos "place." The meaning
"matter treated in speech or writing, subject, theme" is first
recorded 1720. Topical "of or pertaining to topics of the day" is
recorded from 1873.
