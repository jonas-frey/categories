Workshop Announcement

Categorical Algebra and Computation
A Workshop in Honour of John Power on the occasion of his 60th Birthday

23rd December 2019
Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Kyoto University

http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~hassei/ajp60/


We are delighted to host a workshop in honour of John Power on the occasion of
his 60th birthday at RIMS, Kyoto University. John, recently retired and now
a honorary professor at Macquarie University, Sydney, is staying in Kyoto as
a visiting professor of RIMS for the winter of 2019/2020. During his stay in
Kyoto, John turns 60.

John has made substantial contributions in category theory and its applications
to computer science throughout his career. At the same time, he has been
a wonderful teacher, mentor and friend to many of us, with his exceptional
insights, kindness, and humour.

Since the 1990's John has regularly visited Japan and worked with Japanese
researchers, including several PhD students and young postdocs.
John's presence has made great impact on Japanese research community of
semantics of computation and related fields; John has co-authored a number of
papers with young Japanese researchers and served as their mentor.

This workshop will feature talks by John's friends and collaborators as well as
young Japanese researchers who are under the influence of John's work
in a broad sense.

The speakers will include
- Soichiro Fujii (Kyoto University)
- Shin-ya Katsumata (NII, Tokyo)
- Yoshiki Kinoshita (Kanagawa University)
- Yuichi Komorida (NII, Tokyo)
- Steve Lack (Macquarie University)
- Ken Sakayori (University of Tokyo)
and John Power.
