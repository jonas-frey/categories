Thank you Fred for your nice description of Sammy's proof
that every subgroup is an equaliser (is a regular subgroup).
I would like to suggest a small variant which might be simpler.
Sammy's proof can be decomposed in three steps:

(1) the pullback of a regular subgroup is regular;

(2) Every subgroup of a group G is the stabiliser of a point in some =
G-set;

(3) If E! is the full permutation group of a set E,
then the stabiliser S(p) of a point p in E is a regular subgroup of E!.

The key argument lies in step (3). Let E' be the set obtained from E by
adding copy p' of p. There are two embeddings u,u':E-->E',
the first u is the inclusion of E in E', and the second u' is defined=20
by putting u'(p)=3Dp' and u'(x)=3Dx for x different than p.
This leads to a pair of homomorphisms h,h':E!-->E'! the equaliser of =
which
is the stabiliser S(p) of p in E!.

This last argument seems to differ from the argument you have presented.
=20
Am I making an error?

What the origins of the argument Mac Lane outlines here are, I don't =
know.=20
I do seem to recall that I first saw more or less such an argument in a=20
graduate course Sammy gave at Columbia during the "golden era" =
1958-1963, =20
and that Sammy himself, probably at a Bowdoin NSF summer semester on=20
categories, revealed his deft trick by which to convert the argument for =

the "index greater than 2" case to a uniform argument ignoring the=20
subgroup's index.

Let me record that argument here.

Given are a group G, a subgroup H of G, and an element a in G \ H.

P is to be the group of permutations of the underlying set of the left=20
G-set got by forming the coproduct=20

G/H + 1

of the principal left G-set G/H of left cosets xH of H in G (x ? G)=20
with a (trivial) terminal left G-set 1 =3D {*} (assume * ? G/H):

P =3D perm(|G/H| ? {*}) =3D (|G/H| ? {*})! .

One permutation in particular is to be singled out for attention: the=20
transposition t ? P interchanging * with the coset H itself.

Let me use r: G --> P for the result of composing the regular=20
representation of G by left action (g, xH) |-> (gx)H on the cosets of H=20
with the obvious injection of (|G/H|)! into (|G/H| ? {*})! -- thus:

[r(g)](xH) =3D (gx)H  ,
[r(g)](*) =3D * .

And let me write s: G --> P for the result of conjugating by t the =
various=20
assorted values of r -- thus:

[s(g)](xH) =3D t([r(g)](t(xH))) ,
[s(g)](*) =3D t([r(g)](t(*))) =3D t([r(g)](H)) =3D t(gH) .

The end-game strategy is now this:

(i) for h ? H: r(h) =3D s(h) ; yet
(ii) for g =3D a, [r(a)](*) =3D * but [s(a)](*) =3D aH (whence r ?  s).

Details: Bear in mind that if, for x in G and h in H, we have (hx)H =3D =
H,=20
we must have hx in H, whence also x in H so that xH =3D H. Then for (i):

(a) if xH ? H -- [s(h)](xH) =3D t([r(h)](xH)) =3D t((hx)H) =3D (hx)H =3D =
[r(h)](xH)
;
(b) if xH =3D H -- [s(h)](H) =3D t([r(h)](*)) =3D t(*) =3D H =3D =
[r(h)](H) ;
(c) and at * -- [s(h)](*) =3D t([r(h)](H)) =3D t(H) =3D * =3D [r(h)](*) =
.

And bear in mind also that aH ? H because a ? H; thus:

for (ii) -- [s(a)](*) =3D t([r(a)](H)) =3D t(aH) =3D aH ? * =3D =
[r(a)](*) .

By the way, if the subgroup H had index 3 or more in G, one need not=20
require recourse to any external element * as above -- one could let any =

coset other than H and aH (when there are such) play the role of *, and, =

with but a few additional wrinkles (unless I am mistaken (which is =
always =20
possible :-) )), I believe that is essentially how the proof George =
cites =20
from Mac Lane's exercise works.

Cheers, -- Fred
