This is in reply to a posting by Bob Pare.=A0

Dear Bob:=A0
You wrote:=A0
=93As usual it helps put things in relief to generalize them.=A0Consider ca=
tegory theory in a world based on a topos S. A small category is a=A0catego=
ry object in S. A large category like S or Group(S) is an indexed=A0categor=
y=2C given by a pseudo-functor S^op -> Cat=2C or a fibration over S if=A0yo=
u prefer. A small category C gives a large one by homming. But something is=
=A0lost in the process.=94=A0
That is precisely how I always thought=A0of small versus large relative to =
a topos S (the universe of discourse).=A0Further=2C a large category A (fib=
ered over S) "is" small if and only=A0if the corresponding pseudo-functor A=
: S^op--> Cat is representable.=A0As you=A0say=2C a small category C (inter=
nal to the topos S) may always be considered as a=A0large one (via its exte=
rnalization [C]: S^op ->Cat).=A0
These considerations came up in my and=A0our joint work on stacks (Cahiers=
=2C 1979)=2C and more recently in my work with=A0Claudio Hermida on 2-stack=
s. The notions of a stack and of a 2-stack are taken =A0to be intrinsic to =
a topos S=2C that is=2C relative to the topology of its=A0(regular) epimorp=
hisms=2C as introduced by Lawvere 1974.=A0
Dimension 1. A small category C (internal to a topos=A0S) always has a stac=
k completion when regarded as a large category via its=A0externalization [C=
]. The stack completion of C is given by yon: [C] -> [C]*=3D LocRep(S^(C^op=
))=2C a weak equivalence functor. Applied to a groupoid G=2C this=A0gives t=
he classification theorem for G-torsors (Diaconescu 1975).=A0An axiom=A0of =
stack completions (ASC) in its rough form says that S satisfies it if for=
=A0ever small category C in S=2C the fibration LocRep(S^{C^op}) is represen=
table by=A0a category C* so that [C]* and [C*] are equivalent as fibrations=
. As shown by=A0Joyal and Tierney (1991) by means of Quillen model structur=
es=2C but also by a=A0general argument involving the existence of a set of =
generators=2C (Duskin 1980)=2C=A0Grothendieck toposes satisfy (ASC).=A0
Dimension 2. The 2-dimensional analogue of the above=A0set-up was discussed=
 in my lecture at CT 2008 (joint work with Claudio Hermida).=A0Our main res=
ult is that=2C for a topos S satisfying (ASC)=2C any 2-category 1-stack=A0C=
 in S=2C regarded as a 2-fibration=2C has a 2-stack completion=2C to wit yo=
n: [C]=A0-> [C]*=3DLocRep(Stack^(C^op))=2C a weak 2-equivalence 2-functor. =
Applied to a=A02-gerbe G and suitably interpreted=2C this gives a classific=
ation theorem for=A0G-2-torsors.=A0The validity of an appropriately formula=
ted (ASC)^2 for a=A0Grothendieck topos S (see slides for my lecture at CT 2=
008) is true by a=A0general argument involving the existence of a set of ge=
nerators. What is still=A0missing=2C however=2C is a construction of a smal=
l 2-category 1-stack C*representing the 2-fibration [C]*=3D LocRep(Stack^(C=
^op)) in the case of a=A0Grothendieck topos S. The Quillen model structure =
on 2-Cat given by Lack 2002=A0is not suitable for this purpose.=20

Dimension n. Analogue results in higher=A0dimensions are less tractable but=
 a pattern emerges from the passage from=A0dimension 1 to dimension 2. =A0

Remark (concerning a previous posting of yours): Although using the S-index=
ed=A0versions of fibrations over S is useful=2C just as presentations of gr=
oups are=A0useful=2C the entire discussion of stacks can be carried out at =
the level of=A0fibrations (ditto 2-fibrations). I fail to understand what i=
s all the fuss=A0about the use of S-indexed categories if taken in that spi=
rit. Certainly not deserving=A0ridicule!

=A0You also wrote:=A0
=93Well this is my second posting in a=A0week bringing my life-time total=
=A0to three! Seems a good place to stop.=94

=A0To me=2C that is a poor reason to give.=A0This forum could certainly pro=
fit from your interventions=2C but I understand=A0your qualms=2C as I mysel=
f quite often abstain from an urge to intervene.=A0

=A0Happy New Year to you and everyone=2C=A0Marta
