In addition to the peoples who have expressed their support in public
many have done it privately. None have opposed it yet.
Some peoples have expressed doubts about the feasability.
In a letter to some of my correspondants I wrote:

The realisation of iBourbaki depends on the collaboration of the =
mathematical community
in large, not only of category theorists. It also depends on the =
collaboration and support
of a group of computer scientists. My task at this point is to convince =
peoples that the=20
project is worthy and feasable.=20

Dear Andre Joyal and categorists,

Various networking models for collaborating on mathematics have been=20
alluded to or suggested on this
list (which is itself based on the listserv networking model).

They include desktop sharing if that would be required. Mathematical =

I add through LaTeX, compiling, converting to pdf, and using the =

tool to paste bitmapped formulas on the whiteboard.

the usual kind of wiki is not suitable for collaborative science, but
recently there has been news of a special wiki for scientists which has
good support for references, keeps track of who said what, and has a

Mathematics may be too much in a state of foundational

the best we can hope for is something a bit more like Wikipedia,
where different people contribute different portions of text, and
they don't cohere in a polished whole.  But presumably anyone calling
for a new Bourbaki wants something different from Wikipedia.

I would like to see lots of people try lots of different things.

A network model not yet mentioned is the multiple-thread technical=20
support forum. See,
for example

http://www.theimagingsourceforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=3D6
http://www.essentialobjects.com/Forum/Default.aspx
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/ajax/
http://www.codeproject.com/Lounge.aspx?msg=3D2730104#xx2730104xx

Technical support forums centralize expertise, whereas collaborative=20
mathematics would
best have mutually supportive distributed expertise. Each thread=20
would be moderated
to maintain topic and civility, like the categories listserv.

Crucial to much mathematical collaboration is sharing of diagrams=20
alongside mathematical
expressions and natural language text. A webcam over a pad provides=20
this important
function. I myself have used Skype to discuss one-sided limits with=20
my son who is away
at college, where instead of looking at each other's face  we aimed=20
our webcams at pads.

One step beyond separate pads beneath webcams is the idea of a=20
"virtual drawing" which
per discussion thread would overlay appropriately transparent images=20
from multiple
collaborators: a shared blackboard in your web browser.

A web-site for collaborative mathematics could combine the secure=20
multiple-thread forum model
with virtual drawing. Every participant would have the option to=20
record part or all of a thread
for off-line review. Combined with video-conferencing via Skype or=20
the like, real-time
collaboration is an option.

Since this project entails substantial programming effort, I would=20
like to measure the
level of support the project could expect from the category-oriented=20
research community.
Your judgement is much appreciated.

Ellis D. Cooper
