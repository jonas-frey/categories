   The Workshop on Domains is aimed at computer scientists and
   mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical
   foundations of computation. The workshop will focus on
   domains, their applications and related topics.

CONTRIBUTED TALKS

   A list of contributed talks with abstracts is available from the
   workshop page (see URL above) that contains also more
   information about the scope of the meeting.


FORMAT

   The emphasis is on the exchange of ideas between participants similar
   in style to Dagstuhl seminars.  In particular, talks on subjects
   presented at other conferences and workshops are acceptable.


VENUE

   The workshop will take place at the University of Sussex. It will
   commence at 9:30am on Monday morning and close around 4pm on
   Wednesday afternoon.


ACCOMMODATION

   Bed & breakfast on campus in single rooms with en suite bathroom
   (standard) is available at 45 pounds per night in our brand new
   halls of residence or at a more economical 30.50 pound with shared
   facilities (budget).
   Lunch is included in the registration fee. There will be no organized
   evening meals except the Workshop dinner.


REGISTRATION

   Registration is now open. Please download the registration form
   from the workshop web pages at:

<http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/events/domains9/index.htm#registration
 >

                EARLY REGISTRATION DEADLINE is

                       ***   AUGUST 7th ***

   at the reduced registration fee of 40 pounds. Please register as
   early as possible to secure a room at the above mentioned rates
   on campus. You can still register after August 7th at a fee of
   70 pounds but in this case availability of rooms is not guaranteed
   and you may need to find accommodation yourself which can be
   quite tricky in Brighton.

   Note that the registration fee includes all lunches (Mo-Wed).
   Lunches will take place in a building adjacent to the lecture
theatre.

   To register, please print the form, filling in all relevant fields
   including your room booking and credit card details. Sign the
   form and fax it  (or send via surface mail) to

   Successful registration will be confirmed by email.
   Registered participants will then receive further instructions about
   their accommodation, check in, and the exact location of the meeting
   They will get a receipt at the meeting.

   You are expected to pay by credit card. If this is impossible or
   if you have further questions regarding registration please
