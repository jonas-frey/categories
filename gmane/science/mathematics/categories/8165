I regret to inform you all that Jim died this afternoon.  His son says it 
was congestive heart failure which is as good a way as any to describe 
dying of old age.  He was still coming to seminar last fall and celebrated 
his 91st birthday in December in pretty good shape, but has been gradually 
going downhill since.  I don't believe he came to the office since late 
fall.  He had a good run.

Michael
