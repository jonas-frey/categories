Just to set the record straight...

That's not quite correct: Gentzen uses
  a,b,... |- x,y,...
to mean "(a and b and ...) entails (x or y or ...)".
So what you have written is (if interpreted strictly
according to Gentzen's sequent calculus)
  if "S entails (a or b)" then "S entails (a and b)"
which is obviously incorrect.

What Gentzen would write is this:
S |- a       S |- b
-------------------
     S |- a/\b
(if "S entails a" and "S entails b", then "S entails
(a and b)"); he would also write (separately)
S |- a/\b
---------
 S |- a
(if "S entails (a and b)", then "S entails a") and
(again separately)
S |- a/\b
---------
 S |- b
(if "S entails (a and b)", then "S entails b").

The point here is that Gentzen did not actually intend
his  horizontal line notation to represent any sort of
bijection.  In fact, I rather suspect that he borrowed
the line from elementary-school arithmetic:
  24
  73
  92
----
 189.

[The only reason for writing
S |- a       S |- b
-------------------
     S |- a/\b
instead of
 S |- a
 S |- b
---------
S |- a/\b
is in case you want to append proofs of S |- a and
S |- b.  In this manner one represents (complete)
proofs as trees, where the leaves are axioms, and
the root is the theorem being proven.]

But I don't think the fact that Gentzen did not intend
this horizontal line notation to represent the bijection
which is obviously there should stop us from doing it:
it's a very convenient way of discussing adjunctions,
and there is as little chance of confusing the older
use of this symbol with the newer one as confusing
either with elementary school arithmetic.

Cheers,
Jeff.
