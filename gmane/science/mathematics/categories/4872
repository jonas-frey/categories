Dear Andrei,
   Speaking about research programmes,  Makkai's generalized sketches
should definitely be mentioned. An easy introduction can be found in

A Diagrammatic Logic for Object-Oriented Visual Modeling
Zinovy Diskin and Uwe Wolter
DOI Bookmark:	10.1016/j.entcs.2008.10.041

It provides references to Makkai's papers and some other sources, and
briefly describes some history and motivations. You may skip all
sentiments about engineering applications, or do just the opposite --
pay attention to them -- at least, this is what granting agencies
like.

There are two distinctions from Makkai's sketches: a signature of
diagram predicates is a category rather than a set, and semantics is
given in terms of functors into sketches rather than from them.
