Dear Ronnie,

only just saw your message via David's reply.

Just for completeness it seems one should say that there is quite a
bit known about additive n-categories even for n all the way from 1 to
infinity -- they are called stable infinity-categories. Examples of
these are in particular given by modules over infinity-rings -- which
are maybe better known as ring spectra!

A modern entry point into the theory, from a category-theoretic point of vi=
ew is

Jacob Lurie
Commutative algebra
http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0703204

But the basic elements and examples of the theory, such as
E-infinity-rings, A-infinity-algebras and their modules and module
categories are of course way older and quite classical even.

All the best
Urs
