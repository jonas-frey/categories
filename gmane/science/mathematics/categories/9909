ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

25th International Conference on Types for Proofs and Programs, TYPES
2019

and

EUTYPES Cost Action CA15123 meeting

Oslo, Norway, 11 - 14 June 2019

https://cas.oslo.no/types2019/

TYPES 2019 will be held in parallel (and jointly on 12 June) with

HoTT-UF, 12-14 June 2019, https://cas.oslo.no/hott-uf/


REGISTRATION: https://cas.oslo.no/types2019/registration/

The deadline for early registration is 25 May. When you register we send
you (in a few days)
a mail with some information about (discounted, still expensive) hotel
options close to the
conference site. You will be able to find cheaper accomodation a bit
farther from the city center,
still very well connected by public transport. Don't wait for the EU
funding, or our grants for
young researchers, to be decided. Book a hotel ASAP with a cancellation
option and/or payment
upon arrival.


PROGRAM (!!!TENTATIVE!!!) : http://www.ii.uib.no/~bezem/program.pdf


INVITED SPEAKERS

    * Adam Chlipala (MIT, Cambridge MA, USA):
      Challenges Scaling Type-Theory-Based Verification to Cryptographic
Code in Production

    * Assia Mahboubi, (INRIA, Nantes, France): Classical analysis in
dependent type theory

    * Conor McBride (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK): Check the
Box!

    * Stephanie Weirich (University of Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, USA):
      A Dependently-Typed Core Calculus for GHC


BACKGROUND

The TYPES meetings are a forum to present new and on-going work in all
aspects of type theory and its applications, especially in formalised
and computer assisted reasoning and computer programming.

The TYPES areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

    * foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics;
    * applications of type theory;
    * dependently typed programming;
    * industrial uses of type theory technology;
    * meta-theoretic studies of type systems;
    * proof assistants and proof technology;
    * automation in computer-assisted reasoning;
    * links between type theory and functional programming;
    * formalizing mathematics using type theory.

We encourage talks proposing new ways of applying type theory. In the
spirit of workshops, talks may be based on newly published papers,
work submitted for publication, but also work in progress.

The EUTypes Cost Action CA15123 (eutypes.cs.ru.nl) focuses on the same
research topics as TYPES and partially sponsors the TYPES Conference:
Part of the programme is organised under the auspices of EUTypes.


POST-PROCEEDINGS

Similarly to TYPES 2011 and TYPES 2013-2018, a post-proceedings volume
will be
published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in
Informatics (LIPIcs) series. Submission to that volume will be open to
everyone.
Tentative submission deadline: September 2019.

ABOUT TYPES

The TYPES meetings from 1990 to 2008 were annual workshops of a
sequence of five EU funded networking projects. From 2009 to 2015,
TYPES has been run as an independent conference series. From 2016,
TYPES is partially supported by COST Action EUTypes CA15123. Previous
TYPES meetings were held in Antibes (1990), Edinburgh (1991), B??stad
(1992), Nijmegen (1993), B??stad (1994), Torino (1995), Aussois (1996),
Kloster Irsee (1998), L??keberg (1999), Durham (2000), Berg en Dal near
Nijmegen (2002), Torino (2003), Jouy-en-Josas near Paris (2004),
Nottingham (2006), Cividale del Friuli (2007), Torino (2008), Aussois
(2009), Warsaw (2010), Bergen (2011), Toulouse (2013), Paris (2014),
Tallinn (2015), Novi Sad (2016), Budapest (2017), Braga (2018).
