Dear Vaughan,

I used the same argument in "Topical Categories of Domains" Propn 2.3.7
(published 1999, though long in the gestation). I remarked "We briefly
recall the usual argument", so I'm not claiming any priority. As I
recall I had little trouble working out the proof for myself, but I knew
the result as folklore and assumed any simple proofs would be part of
the same folklore.

(Actually, my result is slightly more general. I was working in a
2-category (of Toposes) that, unlike Cat, is not well-pointed. Given the
endo-1-cell T, I assumed that the 0-cell A of T-algebras (the inserter
from T to the identity) had a global point - a 1-cell from 1 to A - that
was strongly initial in the sense that it was left adjoint to the unique
1-cell A -> 1. In my context the simple argument still worked.)

Regards,

Steve.
