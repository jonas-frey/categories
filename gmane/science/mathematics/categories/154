A constant function in Haskell, as in Maths, has 1 as a domain. The
(isomorphism class of the)
singleton set is written as (); so, for example, the function always
returning integer 5 is declared as

five :: () -> Int

and defined by five () = 5 (notice notation () is used to denote both
set 1 and its (unique) element)

Your student is probably confusing notation () with the empty set.
The notation may be a bit unfortunate
as () may suggest "no input" ... but, of course functions, in
functional programming are just
functions.
