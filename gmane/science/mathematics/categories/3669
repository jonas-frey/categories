Category theory is too abstract for any such statement to be true (or even
make sense).  For example, in the category denoted . ---> . (with two
objects and one non-identity map), that map is monic and epic for want of
any test maps.  More concretely, the inclusion of Z into R is both in the
category of commtative rings.  In fact the following a characterization of
monic/epics in commutative rings is this: a subring R \inc S is epic
iff every element of of S can be written s = vAw where for some n, v is
an n-dimensional row vector, w is an n-dimensional column vector and A is
an n x n matrix of elements of S such that the entries of A, vA, and Aw
all belong to R.  In general, very little can be said about monic/epics.
