==============================================================
26th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TYPES FOR PROOFS AND PROGRAMS 2020 -
2-5 MARCH
10th WORKSHOP ON INTERSECTION TYPES AND RELATED SYSTEMS - 6 MARCH
==============================================================

https://types2020.di.unito.it

Turin, Italy


The TYPES meetings are a forum to present new and on-going work in all
aspects of type theory and its applications, especially in formalised
and computer assisted reasoning and computer programming.

The TYPES areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

* foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics;
* applications of type theory;
* dependently typed programming;
* industrial uses of type theory technology;
* meta-theoretic studies of type systems;
* proof assistants and proof technology;
* automation in computer-assisted reasoning;
* links between type theory and functional programming;
* formalizing mathematics using type theory.

We encourage talks proposing new ways of applying type theory. In the
spirit of workshops, talks may be based on newly published papers,
work submitted for publication, but also work in progress.

The EUTypes Cost Action CA15123 (eutypes.cs.ru.nl) focuses on the same
research topics as TYPES and partially sponsors the TYPES Conference:
Part of the program is organised under the auspices of EUTypes.

INVITED SPEAKERS

* Ulrik Buchholtz
* Pierre Marie-P?drot
* Leonardo de Moura
* Sara Negri


The ITRS 2020 workshop aims to bring together researchers working
on both the theory and practical applications of systems based on
intersection types and related approaches.
Possible topics for submitted papers include, but are not limited to:

* Formal properties of systems with intersection types.
* Results for related systems, such as union types, refinement types, or
singleton types.
* Applications to lambda calculus, pi-calculus and similar systems.
* Applications for programming languages, program analysis, and program
verification.
* Applications for other areas, such as database query languages and
program extraction from proofs.
* Related approaches using behavioural/intensional types and/or
denotational semantics to characterize
  ?? computational properties.
* Quantitative refinements of intersection types.
