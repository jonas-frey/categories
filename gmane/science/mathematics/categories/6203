Shall we stop saying "natural" and say "invariant under composition"?
Or is that term allowed under the grandfather clause,
since it was being used imprecisely before category theory defined it?
If I can find a citation where John Baez used the term "evil"
before he knew how to define it, will that make it OK?
Or is that irrelevant because John was already working in the ghetto?

As a proud citizen of the Ghetto of Category Land,
I've used that term in other contexts than this discussion.
If you do not wish to join us, what does that matter?
You may continue to write down strict definitions,
and we will continue to weaken them as we need.
Different styles of mathematics are not at war.

I understand that "evil" is grating; other terms have been suggested.
But no, *any* short term to replace "not invariant under equivalence"
is forbidden by your decree: it relegates us to the ghetto.
Well, that is your interpretation, but it doesn't affect my mathematics.
