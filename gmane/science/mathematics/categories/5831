Dear Ronnie,

This is why I am thinking you could embrace the way the term is used
these days: because it follows precisely your use back then, only
removing the restriction of strictness. And algebraicity can  be
restored. See below...

This has recently been clarified by Thomas Nikolaus in his work on
algebraic Kan complexes (which are essentially simplicial
T-complexes!) and algebraic quasi-categories:

  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+structure+on+algebraic+fibrant+objects

He shows that the model category/quasi-category/(oo,1)-category (check
preferred term) of all Kan complexes is equivalent to that of all Kan
complexes with all horn fillers chosen.

And analogously: that the model
category/quasi-category/(oo,1)-category (check preferred term) of all
quasi-categories is equivalent to that of all quasi-categories with
all inner horn fillers chosen.

This says that while a Kan complex or quasi-category is not directly
an algebraic model for an oo-groupoid or (oo,1)-category,
respectively, you can immediately turn it into an algebraic model by
making choices, and up to equivalence, the resulting algebraic model
does not depend on these choices.

Best,
Urs
