Dear Peter,

A special case is that of groups (with 0 adjoined) and fields. But even
that is hard. In Paul Cohn's book on Skew Fields (p.145 of 1995 edition)
he says "The problem of characterizing the multiplicative group of a
field has not yet been solved even in the commutative case, but there
are some results on the subgroups of fields." (The main result he cites,
one of Amitsur's, says that a finite group G can be embedded as a
subgroup in the multiplicative group of a [skew]field if and only if G
is (i) cyclic, or (ii) a certain kind of metacyclic group, or (iii) a
certain from of soluble goup with a quaternion subgroup, or (iv) the
binary icosahedral group SL_2(F_5) of order 120.)

Even in finite fields F = Z/p, the additive structure is not determined
on the nose by the multiplicative structure. If the group F* has a
non-identity automorphism alpha then (extending alpha to take 0 to 0) a
different addition for the same multiplication can be defined by x +' y
= alpha^{-1}(alpha(x) + alpha(y)). This would be the original addition
only of alpha preserves addition; but then since it preserves 0 and 1,
and 1 is an additive generator, then it would have to be the identity.
An example is F_5, where the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 4
and has a non-identity automorphism that swaps the two generators.

There remains the deeper question of whether you can have non-isomorphic
additive groups for the same multiplicative group.

Regards,

Steve.
