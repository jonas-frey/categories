In 2006 I published a paper called Topological *-autonomous categories 
(TAC, 16, 700-708).  Looking it over early this year I realized it was 
badly flawed with gaps, incorrect proofs, and omissions (of things claimed 
in the intro).  I have rewritten it, fixing all the flaws (I hope at any 
rate).  Somewhat reluctantly, I submitted it to TAC, but the referee felt, 
doubtless correctly, that this revision was not really up to the quality 
of the leading journal in CT, but should be published elsewhere.  Where 
for heaven's sake?  Certainly not in one of the hundreds of vanity 
journals whose solicitations fill my mailbox daily.

Anyway, it is the top paper that appears on the web site that contains 
virtually all the papers I have ever written as well as a few 
miscellaneous things (such as the Tohoku translation):
