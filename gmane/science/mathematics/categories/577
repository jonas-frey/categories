From: Uday S Reddy <reddy@cs.uiuc.edu>

Happy New Year, everyone.

I have been wondering about a little question.  Category theory texts
talk about "algebras" for an endofunctor, which are arrows of type FA ->
A, and dually coalgebras A -> GA.  I am interested in the symmetric
case, arrows of type FA -> GA for endofunctors F and G.  
Have such structures been studied?

This is only scratching the surface.  One can ask for a family of such
arrows for an algebra.  One can consider functors F,G: C -> D between
different categories leading to algebras of the form <A, f:FA->GA> where
A is an object of C, and f an arrow in D, and so on.  I am also
interested in the "diagonal" case, arrows of type FAA -> GAA where F and
G are functors C^op x C -> C.  (Note that all these structures have a
"natural" notion of homomorphisms.)

I would appreciate any pointers to the literature.
