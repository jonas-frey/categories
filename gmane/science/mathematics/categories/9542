I have only partial answers to your question.=20

Consider F a bdd S-topos, not necessarily locally connected. There are two =
instances of non-discrete localic generalizations of the discrete \Pi_0(F) =
of connected components that may be relevant. They were both reported in my=
  lecture "On two non-discrete localic generalizations of \pi_0=E2=80=9D at =
the Colloque Internationale =E2=80=98Charles Ehresmann : 100 ans=E2=80=9D, =
Amiens, 2005. An abstract is included in Cahiers de Top.et Geo.Diff.Cat 46-=
3 (2005). A fuller account of my lecture can be found in my Research Gate p=
age. It consists of two unrelated parts.=20

The first part (otherwise unpublished) reports my construction of the total=
ly (paths) disconnected topos P_0(F) of path components of F by collapsing =
paths to a point. It was also the subject matter of a lecture that I gave a=
t UNIGE Seminar in 2003, and of another that I gave at the Workshop on the =
Ramifications of category Theory, Firenze, 2003.=20

    =20
The second part (in collaboration with J. Funk, published as =E2=80=9CQuasi=
components in topos theory : the hyperpure-complete spread factorization=E2=
=80=9D, Math.. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc 142. 2007 ) contains a construction of=
  the zero-dimensional topos \P_0(F) of quasicomponents of F.=20

Both reduce to the usual (discrete) in the case of a locally connected topo=
s F.=20

With best regards,
Marta

Subject: categories: Topos theory for spaces of connected components

Topos theory gives a solid account of local connectedness, where each open =
-  indeed, each sheaf - has a set (discrete space) of connected components.=
  The definition of locally connected geometric morphism covers not only ind=
ividual spaces but also bundles, considered fibrewise. It also covers gener=
alized spaces as well as ungeneralized.

Is there an analogous theory for where the space of connected components is=
  Stone? ("Connected" is now defined by orthogonality with respect to Stone =
spaces instead of discrete spaces.)

The obvious example is any Stone space X, for instance, Cantor space, where=
  X  is its own space of connected components. We get Stone spaces of connec=
ted components more generally for any compact regular space - take the Ston=
e space corresponding to the Boolean algebra of clopens. People tend not to=
  notice  the Stone space aspects in the usual examples based on real analys=
is, since  they are also locally connected. Being a Stone space then just m=
akes the set of connected components finite with decidable equality. For an=
y compact regular space, we find that each closed subspace has a Stone spac=
e of connected components.

(By the way, if you wonder what brought me to this, it was from pondering t=
he symmetric monad M on Grothendieck toposes. Bunge and Funk proved that fo=
r ungeneralized spaces its localic reflection is the lower powerlocale, whi=
ch raises the question of whether there is a missing topos construction who=
se localic reflection is the upper powerlocale. On the other hand, the symm=
etric monad is related to local connectedness. Points of MX are cosheaves o=
n X, and  X is locally connected if there is a terminal cosheaf in a strong=
  sense, with that cosheaf providing the sets of connected components. Perha=
ps understanding the Stone space view of connected components would cast li=
ght on this missing construction.)

All the best,

Steve.
