Apropos of Peter's kind remarks, the journal version of our paper
should be in TCS soon, entitled The continuum as a final coalgebra.
Meanwhile it's on the web as

        http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/continuum.ps.gz

Abstract:
We define the continuum up to order isomorphism, and hence up to
homeomorphism via the order topology, in terms of the final coalgebra
of either the functor NxX, product with the set of natural numbers, or
the functor 1 + NxX.  This makes an attractive analogy with the
definition of N itself as the initial algebra of the functor 1 + X,
disjoint union with a singleton.  We similarly specify Baire space and
Cantor space in terms of these final coalgebras.  We identify two
variants of this approach, a coinductive definition based on final
coalgebraic structure in the category of sets, and a direct definition
as a final coalgebra in the category of posets.  We conclude with some
paradoxical discrepancies between continuity and constructiveness in
this setting.


PF>So restrict to the category of posets with _distinct_ top and bottom.

...which has no final object, making the following all the nicer:

PF>The functor  X v X  again has a final coalgebra:

The bipointed-set version of this seems like *the* right way to generate
the topology of the continuum.  Verry nice.

PF>PS
PF>Just for comparison, consider the category of posets and the functor
PF>that sends  X  to  X;1;X.  The open interval is an invariant object 
PF>for this functor but it is not the final coalgebra. For that we need
PF>-- as we called it in Cats and Alligators -- Wilson space. Actually,
PF>not the space but the linearly ordered set, most easily defined as the
PF>lexicographically ordered subset, W, of sequences with values in  
PF>{-1, 0, 1}  consisting of all those sequences such that for all  n 
PF>a(n) = 0  =>  a(n+1) = 0  (take a finite word on  {-1,1}  and pad it
PF>out to an infinite sequence by tacking on  0s).

In other words the continuum plus *two* additional copies of each rational
(as opposed to Cantor space's one additional copy).

PF>It takes more work, but not an infinite amount, to construct a 
PF>coalgebra structure on  I x I  so that the induced binary operation 
PF>I x I --> I  is the midpoint operation, the values of which will be
PF>denoted here as  x|y.  It is pretty much characterized by the 
PF>equations: idempotence, x|x = x; commutativity, x|y = y|x; and middle-
PF>two-interchange, (u|v)|(x|y) = (u|x)|(v|y); together with cancelation:
PF>a|x = a|y  =>  x = y.  If one chooses a zero, then one may prove that
PF>there's an ambient abelian group with unique division by  2, such that 
PF>the given midpoint algebra is a subset closed under the operation
PF>x|y = (x + y)/2.  (There must be an existent reference for this.) 

Here I should be understood as [-1,1].  Peter's implicit definition
of this coalgebra structure on I x I has the following equivalent
five-equation explicit definition (or seven if you count each of (3)
and (4) as two equations).  My apologies to anyone reading this with a
variable-width font.

                  x + y        y + x
(1)               -----    =   -----
                    2            2

                  0 + 0
(2)               -----    =   0
                    2
                                   
                xo1            x + t
                --- + 0        -----o1    where the 2 o's are + and t is -1
(3)              2         =     2           or the 2 o's are - and t is 1
                --------       -------    (o = operator, t = terminator)
                    2             2

               xo1   yo1       x + y
               --- + ---       -----o1       where the 3 o's are either
(4)             2     2    =     2             all - or all +
                -------        -------
                   2              2

                x-1   y+1      x + y
                --- + ---      ----- + 0
(5)              2     2   =     2
                 -------       ---------
                    2              2

All these equations clearly hold on I; the question is, what is their
content?  Well, spacing around + and - is significant: without a space the form
x-1        x+1
--- (resp. --- )  denotes a non-middle (nonzero) element of I which when
 2          2
represented as a string over {-1,0,1} has head -1 (resp. 1) and tail x,
                            x + y
while with a space the form ----- denotes a pair (x,y) of I x I.
                              2
Finally, if -1, 0, or 1 (which includes t) are preceded by a space then
they denote the respective infinite constant sequences -1,-1,-1,... or
0,0,0,.. or 1,1,1... (each of which has that constant as its value).
(Once a sequence hits a zero it stays zero.)

The left hand side always has exactly one spaced +, and at the outermost
level, since that's what we're trying to define.  On the right hand
side, each occurrence of a spaced + denotes a corecursive call (so two
corecursive calls in the last equation --- it might seem like a lot of
bother to do a corecursive call merely to add 0, but the real point of
the second call is of course to divide the result of the first call by 2,
which we can do by taking the mean with 0.)

Equation (1) merely ensures that any pair (x,y) will match the left
hand side of one of (2)-(5) one way round or the other.  Equations
(2)-(4) provide instant gratification inasmuch as they allow immediate
production of the first "trit" (ternary digit) of the mean of x and y
given only the first trit of each of them, thereby explicitly defining
the desired coalgebra structure on I x I.  But if you hit equation (5)
you may be in for a long or even infinite wait (consider taking the mean
of -1,1,-1,1,...  (= -2/3) with 1,-1,1,-1,... (= 2/3), which to us is
obviously zero but not so obviously to equation (5)).  So equation (5)
does not give the coalgebra structure at this part of I x I explicitly,
one must regrettably deduce it by corecursion.
