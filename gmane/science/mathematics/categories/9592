At the occasion of the 10th aniversary of ZX calculus for quantum =
foundation/computing, the recent wave of exciting results concerning =
both for its theoretical underpinning and new applications for quantum =
computing, as well as the simple fact that there never can be enough =
parties, there will be a celebratory workshop in Oxford, at a location =
still to be confirmed.  The main goal of the workshop is to set out and =
coordinate further developments.  At the same time, this would be a good =
occasion for those that would like to learn more about ZX calculus to =
talk to those that have made major contributions.  Live music will also =
be provided, most likely on the eve of the 11th.  If you are interested =
in participating send us an email.

Dates: 7-11 May 2018.

Place: Oxford, at location TBC.=20

Confirmed participants include: Bob Coecke, Ross Duncan, Dusko Pavlovic, =
Simon Perdrix, Aleks Kissinger, Dominic Horsman, Miriam Backens, Amar =
Hadzihasanovic, Vladimir Zamdzhiev, Stefano Gogioso, Quanlong Wang, =
Renaud Vilmart, Kang Feng Ng, Hector Miller-Bakewel, Niel De Beaudrap, =
Giovanni De Felice and Cambridge Quantum Computing Inc. representatives.=
