Sadly, that doesn't work. Let A = {0,1}, B = {0,1}, and let R and S be
respectively the identity relation and the relation which relates each
member of A to both members of B. Then Michael's proposed equalizer is
empty, but the relation from C = {0} to A which relates 0 to both members
of A has equal composites with R and S. (The pair (R,S) does have an
equalizer in Rel, namely the relation C -+-> A just described, but with
a little more ingenuity you can find parallel pairs in Rel having no
equalizer.)
