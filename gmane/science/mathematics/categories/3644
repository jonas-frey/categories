Sorry for possible cross-posting
Dear Academic Community,

In March 2007  Yuri Matiyasevich  will be 60.  In addition to his
outstanding  scientific  achievements,  Yuri Matiyasevich was the
editor  of  several  issues  of  the  journal  "Zapiski Nauchnykh
Seminarov POMI" ("Notes of Mathematical Seminars of St.Petersburg
Department of V.A.Steklov Institute of Mathematics").  He remains
an active author of our journal until now.

We decided  to devote  the next  issue  of  the journal  to  Yuri
Matiyasevich.  Please  find  the  call  for papers below. We will
be grateful if you  distribute  this  call for papers  among your
colleagues.

The deadline is set to May 10, 2007.
******   If you are unable to meet the deadline
