Thanks, all, for the many replies (private as well as to the list).
Among other interesting references, almost everyone suggested Ross
Street's "The formal theory of monads" as well as the recent followup
by Street and Steve Lack, "The formal theory of monads II." I'll add
those to my summer reading list.
