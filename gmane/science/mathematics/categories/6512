I just wrote, much too quickly:

But the last sentence is of course pure nonsense.  The equaliser of the
two set auts 2 -> 2 is 0, and the conclusion is then that the constant
polynomial functor X \mapsto 1 (represented by 1 <- 0 -> 1 -> 1) is
the coequaliser.

Sorry for the nonsense.  I don't know where I had my head.
I can hardly trust myself anymore, but if this second version is
correct, it still illustrates the point I wanted to make, namely that
the colimit is not the 'right' one.

Cheers,
Joachim.
