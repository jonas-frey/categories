We invite applications for:

   - *two* Research Fellow/Senior Research Fellow positions (Deadline: Janua=
ry 5, 2020). Positions are 1 year in the first instance, with the possibili=
ty of extension until December 2022. One position will be at University Col=
lege London, and one at Royal Holloway University of London.

   - *one* PhD studentship at UCL.

Successful applicants will be working on the EPSRC-funded "Verification of =
Hardware Concurrency via Model Learning" (CLeVer) project.

This is a joint research endeavour involving the Computer Science Departmen=
ts of two UK's leading research-intensive universities -- University Colleg=
e London and Royal Holloway University of London -- and ARM, world-leading =
designer of multi-core chips.

We are looking for candidates with experience in one or more of the followi=
ng areas: model learning techniques, verification, concurrency, and formal =
methods. Experience in tool implementation will also be valued.


# HOW TO APPLY


- Applications for *both* the (Senior) Research Fellow positions should be =
made here before *January 5, 2020*:

fair&jcode=3D1847641&vt_template=3D965&adminview=3D1


- Applications for the PhD position should be made here:

Interested applicants are encouraged to contact Prof. Alexandra Silva (alex=
andra.silva@ucl.ac.uk) and Dr. Matteo Sammartino (m.sammartino@ucl.ac.uk).


# ABOUT THE PROJECT

Digital devices increasingly rely on multi-threaded computation, with sophi=
sticated concurrent behaviour becoming prevalent at any scale.
As the complexity of these systems increases, there is a pressing need to a=
utomate the assessment of their correctness, especially with respect to con=
currency-related aspects.

Formal verification provides highly effective techniques to assess the corr=
ectness of systems.
However, formal models are usually built by humans, and as such can be erro=
r-prone and inaccurate.=20

This project aims to:

- develop a verification framework that relies on learning techniques to au=
tomatically build and verify models of concurrency, with a particular focus=
  on multi-core systems.

- apply the framework to industrial verification tasks, in collaboration wi=
th ARM.


The project will provide opportunities for both theoretical and applied res=
earch in several areas of Computer Science, including model learning techni=
ques, verification, concurrency, and formal methods.
