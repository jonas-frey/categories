=46rom today's IMU newsletter:

| 6. DEATH OF ALBRECHT DOLD ON 26-09-2011.
|
| Albrecht Dold, known for fundamental contributions to algebraic
| topology, was born in Germany in 1928. He held positions in Heidelberg,=

| Z=FCrich, Princeton and Columbia. He has been Vice-president of IMU in
1995-98.

I particularly mourn his passing, as it was Dold's algebraic topology =

lectures at Columbia around 1961 (+/- 1) that taught me virtually all =

I know, or would ever learn later, about the Yoneda Lemma.

Born August 5, 1928, in Triberg, Germany, and barely a teenager during =

WW II, Dold would have been 83 at the time of his death.

-- Fred
