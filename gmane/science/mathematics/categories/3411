Mike Barr quoted a "thought of Chairman Pratt" that was attributed to him,

> Monotone functions respect order, group homomorphisms respect the
> group operation, linear transformations respect linear combinations,
> and gangsters respect membership in the Cosa Nostra, but what
> morphism has ever respected membership in a set? It is sheer hubris
> for a relation that can't get no respect to claim to support all of
> mathematics.  (Old argument of category theorist Mike Barr, new
> polemics.)

and commented on it,

> That is not a bad rendition (save for the reference to Cosa Nostra)

> structures of well-founded trees subject to the rule that two

Of course, I entirely agree with the sentiment that epsilon-structures
are completely inappropriate as a basis of most ordinary mathematics.

However, mathematics and mathematicians are contrAry beasts, who
treat any statement of the form "there is no such thing as ..." as a
challenge, whether it be about membership-preserving functions or the
square root of -1.

Indeed, it's quite interesting to look at "carriers equipped with
membership relations" in the same way as "carries equipped with group
multiplications".  This is what I did in my paper "Intuitionistic
Sets and Ordinals", JSL 61 (1996).

For a more categorical treatment, we may regard the relation as a
coalgebra structure for the full covariant powerset functor.  This is
what Gerhard Osius did in his "Categorical Set Theory" in JPAA 4
(1974) and what I did for other functors in my unpublished paper
"Towards a Uniform Treatment of Induction - the General Recusion
Theorem" in 1995-6.  (This was presented at "Category Theory 1995"
in Cambridge and part of it appeared in Section 6.3 of my book.)

As Mike Barr says, and Gerhard Osius proved in his paper, for
"extensional" structures ("well-founded trees subject to the rule that
two > chidren of the same leaf cannot be isomorphic"), the
structure-preserving map must be a subset inclusion.

However, without extensionality, it is a COALGEBRA HOMOMORPHISM.

Well founded coalgebras behave like fragments of the initial algebra
(the von Neumann hierarchy, in the case of the powerset functor), so
their rigidity (lack of endomorphisms) is related to the uniqueness of
homorphisms out of the initial algebra. The sense in which coalgebra
homomorphisms are like partial algebra homomorphisms is explored in
the early sections of my unpublished paper.

Osius's recursion scheme has attracted some attention in recent years
amongst functional programmers as a way of describing recursive
programs.  See "Recursive Coalgebras from Comonads" by Venanzio
Capretta, Tarmo Uustalu and Varmo Vene, in "Information and
Computation" 2006.  In fact, the description also works for
imperative programs - see Section 2.5 of my book.

I have a longer survey of this subject that I intend to publish on
"categories" later this month.


MY WEB PAGES AT   www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pt

While I'm here, I'd like to draw your attention to some new things
that I have put on my web pages recently.

 * The slides that I have used at recent conferences and seminars.

 * The unpublished paper and scanned transparencies of 1995-6 talks
   on well founded coalgebras.

 * A new web page for my book, "Practical Foundations of Mathematics",
   including where to buy it, errata, who has used or cited it, etc.
   If you have used it in a lecture or seminar series, please send
   me a URL and your experiences.

 * The full text of Jean-Yves Girard's "Proofs and Types".

 * A new version of my TeX package for "commutative diagrams", together
   with an explanation of the "PostScript" mode, why the "pure DVI"
   mode is strongly deprecated (NB those long-standing users who have
   spoiled their otherwise excellent books, papers and online journals
   by using it), and how to overcome its uglier features if you really
   insist on using it.

 * A collection of other TeX macros.

 * Scanned manuscripts of my 1983 Cambridge Part III Essay (= MSc thesis)
   (see "domain theory") and undergraduate algebra lecture notes.
