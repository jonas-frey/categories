Jean Pedersen has just informed me of the death of Peter Hilton. =20
Hereafter is part of an obituary notice in a Binghampton paper.
We knew well Peter since Charles had invited Peter in Strasbourg while =20
he was still a young student, and later he visited us several times in =20
Paris and later in Amiens

Peter Hilton, 87, Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at Binghamton =20
Un=EFversity, died on Saturday, November 6, 2010. He is survived by his =20
wife Margaret, sons and daughter-in-law, Nicholas Hilton, Binghamton =20
and Timothy and Catherine Hilton, Seattle, Wa., two grandsons, one =20
great granddaughter and brother and sister-in-law, Dr. Sydney and Mary =20
Hilton, North Wales, U.K.
Peter was born in London, and educated at Oxford University. During =20
World War II, at age 18, he was recruited from Oxford, because of his =20
mathematical ability and knowledge of German, to work at Bletchley =20
Park, the secret British faciiity dedicated to breaking German codes. =20
Th=EFs project was ledby Alan Turing, the celebrated mathematician and =20
founder of computer science, with whom the young Peter Hilton worked =20
closely. Initially, Peter worked on breaking the Enigma code, and, =20
later, on the more refined Fish code. Once the British Official =20
Secrets Act was lifted in the 1980's, his lectures about the years at =20
Bletchley Park were highly popular at venues all over the world. He =20
gave several such lectures at Binghamton University.
After the War Peter obtained his doctorate from Oxford. Peter went on =20
to hold academic positions at Cambridge and Manchester Un=EFversities, =20
and a Chair at the University of Birmingham.
In 1962, he moved to the United States where he was Professor of =20
Mathematics, first at Cornell, then at the University of Washington =20
and the Batteile Institute. He helcl the Louis D, Beaumont Chair at =20
Case Western Reserve University for a number of years, ending in 1982 =20
when he became Distinguished Professor at Binghamton University, =20
retiring in 1995.
Peter Hilton was one of the most influential mathematicians of his =20
generation. He made major contributions to algebraic topology and =20
homological algebra. His influence on these subjects has been =20
profound. In his later years he was also a significant figure in =20
Mathematics Education, especially in Continental Europe. He published =20
hundreds of research articles and many books on mathematics and =20
mathematics education, and he lectured at conferences into his =20
mid-eighties.
