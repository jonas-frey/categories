Hi, Peter,

Actually, the word "other" below introduces a red herring:
there is in fact every reason *not* to wish to restrict =

attention only to objects O *other* than E or T or X -- indeed, =

I can imagine that there might be settings in which there are =

*no* objects "other than" E or T or X, in which case the =

Wikipedia verbiage quoted paints you into a corner you really =

*don't* want to be in :-) .

Cheers, -- Fred
