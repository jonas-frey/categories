I should really let people with more interest in foundations field this
question, but fools rush in ...

I will pass on this one.  As far as I know, using category theory as
foundations gives an equally powerful, but not more powerful, foundation.
But I would say the same about non-well-founded set theory.  Basically, it
is a matter of convenience and, perhaps, coherence.

I would assume that is what he meant.

In a word: no.

Quite a bit; it is called elementary topos theory.  I want to add
something here.  I have taught a course in set theory (twice, actually). 
I didn't much enjoy it, so perhaps I am prejudiced.  But I have a specific
complaint.  In all the fields of mathematics that I have worked with (all
the axiomatic fields, I should say), structures are defined and then
functions that preserve those structures.  The structure of a set is that
of an epsilon tree, but this structure is ignored when it comes to
defining functions.  A good thing too, since the only functions that
preserve that structure are inclusions of subsets.  And the only
endomorphism of a set is the identity.  Believing that theory should
follow practice, I am unhappy with the standard foundations that build
this elaborate structure only to ignore it.  When categories are used as
foundations, then the undefined terms are object, arrow, domain, codomain,
identity, and the relation (partial function) of composition.  They are
all used regularly in category theory; they are not just there to give a
formal foundation.  And functors are exactly what preserve these things.
