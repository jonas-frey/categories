JPAA SPECIAL ISSUE "CT 2010"

As announced in Genoa during the conference, a special issue of the
Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra related to the conference
Category Theory 2010 is planned. The guest editors are Jiri Adamek,
George Janelidze, Bob Rosebrugh and Pino Rosolini.

The deadline for submissions is

            October 31, 2010

and all papers are to be sent as a pdf file to Jiri Adamek
<adamek@iti.cs.tu-bs.de>, with an indication of which Guest Editor you
prefer to handle your article.

Before submitting, please consult the Journal's submission guidelines at
the url:

http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505614/authorinstructions


Papers submitted must meet the high standards of the journal, but
need not be precisely restricted to the talks of the conference. All
papers will be refereed by one or two referees. In case the volume of
400 printed pages is not sufficient for all accepted papers, some of
the submissions will be published in a normal issue, this will be
decided by the four guest editors. Due to the limitation to a single
issue, articles of twenty-five pages or less will be given priority.

Papers co-authored by a guest editor will be handled by two other
guest editors independently and will only be accepted if both of the
refereeing processes are affirmative.

We are looking forward to receiving many good papers!

Jiri, George, Bob and Pino
