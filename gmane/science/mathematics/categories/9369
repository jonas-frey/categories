Dear Categorists -

Mike Stay's puzzle is quite nice.  I won't answer it.  Instead, I will
generalize
and extend it.

Suppose we have a category C with finitely many objects and morphisms.
Let C^ be the category of presheaves on C, and Omega the subobject
classifier in C^.   There is a Lawvere theory T whose n-ary operations are
the morphisms from Omega^n to Omega.

1.  Is T finitely generated?  That is, can we find a finite collection of
morphisms f: Omega^n -> Omega (for various choices of n) such that
T is generated, as a category with finite products, by these?

2.  Can we find an explicit set of generators for T?

3.  Is T finitely presented?

4.  Can we find an explicit set of generators and relations for T?

My guess on 3 is "yes".

Mike was interested in the case where C^ is the category of reflexive
graphs,
but I think the question would be interesting to study in detail for lots
of other
classic examples.  Someone must have done it already, no?

Best,
jb
