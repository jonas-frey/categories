An additional Housing Announcement in regard to CT2016

Due to the fact that we are holding the AARMS Summer School at Dalhousie be=
fore CT2016, we have access to=20
a limited number of dorm rooms at a lower price than what is advertized on =
the website: only $20 per night.
This rooms are in separate renovated houses and will only be shared with CT=
-participants.
However, I only have about 6-10 of these, and I need to make the commitment=
  to book these tomorrow.
So if you are interested in getting one of those, please contact me right a=
way, and I will accommodate the first takers until the house is full.
