Michael,

That seems a very good and generous idea!

It could  initially be posted on your site, except that it should also be
indefinitely available.

The pdf should have hyperref, and perhaps there should be a complete version
and also a parcelled version, so that wiki and Planet Math could have links
to specific parts. What do you think?

Ronnie
