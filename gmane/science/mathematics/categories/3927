I don't think there's a standard term.

But, I like the term "normalized", since in certain circumstances weak
functors between
bicategories are described by cocycles in group cohomology, and the
cocycle is then
said to be "normalized" when the weak functor preserves identity
1-morphisms. It's an old
fact that every cocycle is equivalent to a normalized one, and this is
related to the fact
that every weak functor is isomorphic to a normalized one.

For more information on this, see:

or for a pedagogical treatment, try section 8.3, "Classifying 2-groups
using
group cohomology", of this:
