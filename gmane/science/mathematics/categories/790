I am certainly no linguist, but it seems obvious to me that in all
three cases, the prefix was attached before the word entered the
English language, and possibly even before the word acquired its
mathematical meaning. 

Coordinate: from Latin ordinare: to arrange, to put in order.
Coordinates are for "arranging" points in the plane, and they
do this jointly. Compare: coordination.

Coefficient: from Latin efficere: to affect, to produce an effect (?).
Coefficients are parameters that affect some quantity, and usually
there is more than one, so again, they do it jointly.

Does anyone know the actual origin of the word "covariant"? My guess
is that in the original context of tensors on manifolds, it is a
contraction of "coordinate invariant", that is, invariant under
transformations of coordinate systems. If this is true, then it fits
neither the "jointly" nor the "complement" nor the "dual" schemes.
Despite the fact that it came first historically, it would seem that
the word "covariant" is an exception to the otherwise (more or less)
consistent use of the prefix co- in category theory. If one were to
change terminology to eliminate this oddity, it would make little
sense to change the rule to accomodate the exception - rather, one
should rename "covariant" to something more logical like "provariant".

I doubt that it would be worth the effort -- especially since the word
"covariant" only ever seems to appear in parentheses.

Best, -- Peter
