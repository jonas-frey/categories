LICS 2007 CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

The Twenty-Second IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2007)
will be held in Wroclaw, Poland, July 10-14, 2007. It will be colocated
with two other meetings: the International Colloquium on Automata,
Languages, and Programming (ICALP'07) July 9-13, 2007, and also the
European Logic Colloquium (ELC 2007), July 14-19.  Workshops are planned
for July 8, 9 and July 15 (possibly the afternoon of 14th).
Detailed information can be found on the LICS 2007 webpage at
http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/lics/lics07/

LICS workshops have traditionally been an important and exciting part of
the program. They introduce either newest research in traditional areas of
the LICS community, recent interdisciplinary and applied areas of general
theory, or emerging directions that already have some substantial overlap
with LICS community interests. Researchers and practitioners are invited to
submit proposals for workshops on topics relating logic - broadly construed -
to computer science or related fields. Typically, LICS workshops feature a
mix of invited speakers and contributed presentations. LICS workshops do not
produce formal proceedings. However, in the past there have been special
issues of journals based in part on certain LICS workshops.

Proposals should include:

- A short scientific summary and justification of the proposed topic.
  This should include a discussion of the particular benefits of the
  topic to the LICS community.
- A discussion of the proposed format and agenda.
- Procedures for selecting participants and papers.
- Expected number of participants. (This is important!)
- Potential invited speakers.
- Plans for dissemination (for example, special issues of journals).
- For workshops of potential interest to ICALP participants, whether
  the workshop should be considered as a possible joint LICS/ICALP
  workshop.
- Tell us the timeframe you would prefer:  1 day, 1.5 or 2 days, either
  before LICS (July 8,9) or after LICS (July 15).  Alas, some overlap
  with either ICALP or ELC is inevitable.

Proposals are due Nov. 15, 2006, and should be submitted electronically to:

Philip Scott
Workshops Chair,  LICS 2007
phil@site.uottawa.ca

Workshops will be chosen by a committee that consists of the LICS
General Chair, LICS Workshop Chair, LICS 2007 PC Chair, and LICS 2007
Conference Chair. In the case of potential joint workshops, these will
be discussed with colleagues from ICALP.  A decision will be made by
the end of November.
