Amir Pnueli was one of the most influential computer scientists of our
time. He published more than 250 papers, many of them groundbreaking,
including the 1977 paper, "The Temporal Logic of Programs," for which he
won the 1996 ACM Turing Award.  On November 2, 2009, Amir unexpectedly
passed away. His loss is felt deeply by friends and colleagues around
the world.

The Amir Pnueli Memorial Symposium is an opportunity for the computer
science community to remember Amir by revisiting the ideas and
challenges which inspired and defined his life's work.  It will
feature talks by a select group of speakers, including two Turing
award winners, other internationally acclaimed researchers, and former
students of Amir.

The symposium will take place at New York University on May 7-9, 2010.
It is open to all who wish to attend.  For more information and to
