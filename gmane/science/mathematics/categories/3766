August 20       CALCO-jnr, CALCO-tools
August 21-24    CALCO technical programme


CALCO'07 takes place at the Grand Hotel Terminus in Bergen, one of many
historic hotels in Norway. The conference starts Monday with two workshops
followed by an official reception Monday evening.  The main program runs
Tuesday through Friday, each morning starting with an invited speaker.
Additional events are excursion by boat in the Bergen archipelago
(Wednesday afternoon) and conference dinner on one of the mountains
surrounding the city centre (Thursday afternoon).


Registration
------------
Registration fee is 3200 NOK (1200 NOK for students), with substantial
discounts for early registration. The fee includes the full conference
with all workshops, a copy of the proceedings,=20
lunches and coffee breaks, internet access and=20
the official reception Monday evening.

Registration is via the calco07 web site:
    http://www.ii.uib.no/calco07/

Note that Bergen is very busy during the tourist season, so early booking
of accommodation and transportation is recommended.



Main CALCO'07 conference
------------------------
CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference. It brings together
researchers and practitioners to exchange new results related
to foundational aspects and both traditional and emerging uses of
algebras and coalgebras in computer science. The study of algebra
and coalgebra relates to the data, process and structural aspects of
software systems. The accepted papers report results of theoretical work
on the mathematics of algebras and coalgebras, the way these results
can support methods and techniques for software development, as well as
experience with the transition of resulting technologies into industrial
practise. Some main key words are:

     * Abstract models and logics
     * Specialised models and calculi
     * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics
     * System specification and verification

The list of accepted papers is available at the web site.


Invited speakers
----------------
Stephen L. Bloom, Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ, USA
Prof. Bloom works on algebraic specification theories and was instrumental
in developing iterative theories, an elaborate coalgebraic method -
predating coalgebras.

Luis Caires, New University of Lisbon, Portugal
Prof. Caires has made important contributions to the field of distributed
and mobile systems, and spatial logics for these.

Barbara K=88=8Fnig, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany
Prof. K=88=8Fnig works on graph transformation systems, with applications
to concurrent and mobile systems, software reliability and security.

Glynn Winskel, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom
Prof. Winskel is well-known for his fundamental work in semantics and
theory of concurrency.


CALCO-jnr (CALCO Young Researchers Workshop)
--------------------------------------------
CALCO-jnr is dedicated to presentations by PhD students and by those who
completed their doctoral studies within the past few years. This year
12 contributions within the theme of CALCO have been accepted. See the
overview on the CALCO-jnr web page on the CALCO web site.
