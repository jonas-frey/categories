Dear colleagues and friends=2C

We have suffered yet another great loss to our categories group - RFC =0A=
(Bob) Walters. The last time I saw him was at the Memorial Conference =0A=
for Aurelio Carboni=2C Milano=2C June 2013. The photo whose link is given =
=0A=
below=2C taken by Danilo Lawvere=2C shows from left=0A=

Both Aurelio and Bob worked together during several years at Insubria=2C =
=0A=
Como. When Aurelio did not show up at the Calais CT Conference=2C I asked =
=0A=
Bob Walters why=2C and he told me that Aurelio was not sick but worse - =0A=
"disillusioned" with the "new developments"=0A=
in Category Theory=2C a sentiment which several of us shared. Bob =0A=
encouraged me then to visit Aurelio in Como. An interchange of emails =0A=
followed but I could not make it. Aurelio and I had worked together =0A=
during my sabbatical in Genova=2C 2005-06 and had plans for=0A=
a sequel. Our joint paper "The symmetric topos" benefited from his =0A=
incredible algebraic intuition and led to further work. What Aurelio was=0A=
  suffering from=2C however=2C  was not just disillusionment=2C as Bob Walte=
rs =0A=
and even his wife Patrizia Giachetti believed=2C=0A=
but something much more serious and he died shortly after.=20

=0A=
=0A=
Having now lost both Aurelio Carboni and Bob Walters has been a big blow=0A=
  to our group of colleagues and friends in Italy and elsewhere. My deep =0A=
condolences go to Bob's wife and collaborator Nicoletta Sabadini=2C to his=
=0A=
  Italian colleagues and friends=2C and to the=0A=
entire Category Theory Community.
