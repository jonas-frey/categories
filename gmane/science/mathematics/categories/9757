=============================================
2019 DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
     UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM, UK
=============================================

We are happy to announce that applications are now open for the Doctoral
Fellowship programme in Computer Science at the University of
Birmingham, UK, for start in October 2019. These Fellowships fund a
4-year full-time programme of PhD study, and provide a elevated stipend
of ??18,150 per year (tax-free, healthcare provided for free). Successful
applicants will be expected to contribute to the research and teaching
life of the School of Computer Science, with a maximum teaching load of
1 day per week, averaged over the year.

The School of Computer Science has a large and thriving Theoretical
Computer Science research group, with a particular focus on category
theory and its applications to the logical foundations of computer
science. Among our research interests are:

   - category theory and higher category theory;
   - type theory;
   - homotopy type theory and univalent foundations;
   - formal proof;
   - lambda-calculus and computational effects;
   - topology and domain theory;
   - constructive mathematics;
   - quantum computing;
   - semantics;
   - program compilation.

Our group currently has 11 permanent staff (see list below) and more
than a dozen PhD students. We have a weekly seminar, as well as more
informal meetings and reading groups. Information on all of this can be
found on our webpage:

     http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/

The Fellowships are available to UK and EU citizens only. However,
partial fellowships may still be available to Non-EU overseas students
depending on circumstances. Further information about PhD applications
may be found here:
