LCC'09 FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

>>> EXTENDED DEADLINE: JUNE 5

The Tenth International Workshop on Logic and Computational Complexity
(LCC'09, www.cs.indiana.edu/lcc)
will be held in Los Angeles on August 10, 2009, as an affiliated meeting
of LiCS'09 (www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/lics/lics09),
and in conjunction with SAS'09 (sas09.cs.ucdavis.edu).

LCC meetings are aimed at the foundational interconnections between
logic and computational complexity, as present, for example,  in
implicit computational complexity (descriptive and type-theoretic methods);
deductive formalisms as they relate to complexity (e.g. ramification,
weak comprehension, bounded arithmetic, linear logic and resource logics);
complexity aspects of finite model theory and databases;
complexity-mindful program derivation and verification;
computational complexity at higher type; and proof complexity.

The LCC'09 program will consist of invited lectures as well as
contributed papers selected by the program committee.
This year there will be no published proceedings, and work submitted
or published elsewhere is welcome, provided all pertinent information
is disclosed at submission time.  Papers should be written in English,
be accessible to non-specialists, start with a clear statement of the
issues and results, and not exceed 15 pages.

Proposed papers should be uploaded to
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lcc090,
by Friday, June 5, 2009,
with expected notification date of Monday, June 22.
For additional information see www.cs.indiana.edu/lcc,
or email inquiries to lcc@cs.indiana.edu.
