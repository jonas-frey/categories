I have never seen a name for this.  I think, if it hasn't been defined
before, I would be inclined to call it the Morita group.  There is a large
groupoid, let me call it the Morita groupoid, whose objects are rings and
for which a morphism R --> S is a left S, right R bimodule M such that
tensoring with M gives an equivalence between the category of left R
modules and left S modules.  This is locally small since M must be a
finitely generated projective left S module and the group you are dealing
with is simply the group of endomorphisms of R in that groupoid.  the
whole theory is due to Morita (and the main theorem, the Morita theorem).
This is for rings, of course.  I assume that a ringoid is a small
preadditive category.  A preadditive category with finitely many objects
is Morita equivalent to a ring so it will be true for them.  Beyond that,
it would have to be examined because I am not sure what corresponds to
finitely generated.
