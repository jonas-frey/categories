Functional Analysis was one of the key origins
of categorical concepts and outlook, for example
that the functionals themselves should be collected=20
into a single object (Voltera-Hadamard) leads to
the Hom functor,etc. This was also one of the roads
followed by students in the 1950s, for example
from J. L. Kelley's "galactic" treatment of M. H. Stone's
functor C.  However in North America (as distinct
from Europe) more recent functional analysists
have accepted categorical methods only=20
grudgingly, and hence piecemeal.

On the other hand, students who are not=20
specializing in analysis are often woefully ignorant
of the basics of functional analysis that are part=20
of what every mathematician should know. To combat=20
that ignorance in my Advanced Graduate Algebra=20
course I often devoted several weeks to topics
from functional analysis. It is a source of examples
both interesting and essential.

To begin to try to answer Andrej's question, I=20
rapidly recall some examples, and hope others will
also comment:

The double dual functor on Banch spaces is a
protype example of a composite of adjoints becoming
a monad. The EM algebras for this monoid were=20
computed by Fred Linton, in an exercise that should=20
be better known. It also illustrates the "descent"
principle that C. Houzel cited  couple of months ago
(what I called semantics of structure of a given functor=20
in my thesis) : Objects constructed by a given functor
tend to have, by virtue of that, more structure than=20
originally contemplated in its codomain , hence
a lifted version of the functor comes closer to being
invertible.

As Peter Johnstone just recalled, if we consider
commutative monoids with zero and hom them into the
particular object of reals, the resulting set is "actually"
a compact space whose C-algebra reveals by=20
adjointness that the opposite of the spaces form a full=20
subcategory of the monoids with zero. Again a good=20
exercise, related to Kelley's "square root lemma".


Students might wonder why contiuous linear operators
are traditionally called "bounded" (when they are not even).
For many linear spaces (roughly those where sequentiality
suffices) , preserving sequential limits is equivalent to
preserving boundedness of sequences (for a linear map).
George Mackey started to functorize this crucial
observation before categories were fully explicit. Now
we can consider the category of all presheaves on the category
of all countable sets, define an "underlying" functor from
Banach spaces to it, and verify that it actually lands in
the subtopos of sheaves for the finite-disjoint-covering
topology. Indeed it not only gives abelian group objects in
the latter topos, but modules over R, the Dedekind reals
of the topos, and a FULL subcategory of those.

The above construction has an analogue using instead=20
Johnstone's coherent topos of sheaves on countable
compact spaces.
