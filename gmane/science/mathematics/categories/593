We are pleased to announce a conference on

		Wholes and their Parts (W/P)

to be held in

		Bolzano, Maretsch Castle, 17-19 June 1998


1. PRESENTATION
Science is connected to the complementarity of analysis and synthesis. It
may be said that classical physics is characterized by an in-built analysis
of the world into constituent parts (such as atoms or elementary particles).
These are then recomposed together to provide, by means of synthesis, any
system; interactions are linearly and locally described; the resulting
hierarchy of structures is grounded on such constituent parts.
In contemporary science, the age of "pure" analysis seems to have ended.
There are deep mathematical reasons for this. Non-linear systems have
properties that, in general, cannot be expressed in terms of decomposition
into ultimate, unstructured, pointlike parts plus a suitable sets of
relations among them. Moreover, the "dialectic" of quantity and quality is
subtler than was previously thought and this dialectic is needed in the
explanation of all sorts of phenomena. It arises not only in physics, but
also in the study of cognitive systems and natural and programming languages.
Within psychology, it is said that "Gestalten" are cohesive wholes and that
"the whole is more than the sum of its parts". But what does this mean
exactly? Similar questions emerge in other contexts as well.
What is relevant for the foundations of science, the need for a clear
understanding of the part/whole relationships, emerges even in logic and
mathematics, since these provide the tools for organizing our rational image
of the world, in its multi-stratified complexity.
Thus, we are faced with the problem of relating in a possibly coherent way
the various forms of part/whole relationships arising in different branches
of science.
We have not only to classify the different kinds of wholes and their
inherent "grammars", but also to take into account the process of formation
for wholes, in order to describe precisely in which sense the whole emerges
out of its parts and is irreducible to an aggregate of autonomous, more or
less pointlike, entities.
What makes (in part, at least) the difference between mere aggregates and
cohesive wholes? The members of the whole do not simply hang together: they
hang together in the whole, and the structure of the whole influences the
description of the parts and their local interactions. In view of the
growing interest in this sort of pattern, of so deep relevance for
theoretical and applied sciences, it is therefore suitable to clarify the
whole/part issues in crucial fields of research, to compare different
approaches and to develop a foundational discussion.
