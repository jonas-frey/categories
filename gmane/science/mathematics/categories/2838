Hi Colin,

I was there as a freshly minted PhD about to go to my first
academic job at University of Chicago.  What i most vividly
remember was Eilenberg, sitting in the center near the front,
constantly asking smart questions, which did not necessarily
help the speaker; and in particular, of course, i remember
this during my talk on automata and recursion in cartesian
closed categories.  Frankly, i was a bit shocked at the level
of competitiveness that i felt in the institute, no doubt my
naivety showing, after spending laid back years at Berkeley.
