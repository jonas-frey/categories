Many thanks to all who replied to my message, in private and publicly.

I notice that these concerns also arose on this mailing list back in
1992:
http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/archive/1992/92-06.txt

At that time, Michael Barr was asking, amongst other things, about the
exactness property that "every Mal'cev [=difunctional=z-closed]
relation is a pullback", which holds both in toposes and in abelian
categories (as I mentioned below). I wonder if anything more came out
of that. He mentioned a possible connection with "effective unions",
but I haven't been able to get anything to work there.

By the way, following the comments about Mal'cev operators, and Peter
Freyd's "Mal'cev allegories", I note that (exact) categories in which
every relation is difunctional have been called "Mal'cev
categories" [see e.g. the book by Bourn and Borceux on the topic
(pointed out by Peter Lumsdaine), or Carboni, Lambek, Pedicchio,
Diagram chasing in Mal'cev categories, JPAA 69].
