The University of Padua (Italy) is offering 10 grants for study in one
of the PhD programs, beginning January 2007.

The grants are for all doctorate programs, and they are reserved to
non-Italian citizens. More information (in Italian and English) on the
grants and on the university can be found at the website:

http://www.unipd.it/studenti/Dopo_laurea/dottorati_ricerca/bandi_dottorato_grad/bandidottoratograduatorie.htm

Please note that the deadline is October 25, and that the application
must reach the office by that date.

The doctorate school on Mathematical Sciences includes a curriculum in
logic. Before sending the official application, any prospective applicant is suggested to get in contact with:

Bruno Chiarellotto,  director of the school
bruno.chiarellotto@unipd.it

or directly with

Giovanni Sambin, professor of logic
giovanni.sambin@unipd.it

In fact, the application must include a research objective.

Some information on research in logic in Padua can be found at www.math.unipd.it/~logic and www.math.unipd.it/~sambin
