Dear George=2C>

I haste to correct a possible misconception arising from my previous postin=
g=2C and to propose an idea in connection with it. You wrote:=A0

Let C =3D LoCo/E=2C defined as in your book Galois Theories (with F. Borceu=
x). An object p =A0of C with domain F=A0is said to be a covering morphism i=
f there exists a morphism e of effective descent in Top with codomain E suc=
h that (F=2Cp) is split by e. =A0A complete spread p of C with domain F =A0=
- that is=2C an unramified morphism=2C need not be a covering morphism in C=
  in your sense=2C as we know. Whether there is a Galois structure on C whos=
e coverings are precisely the unramified coverings without it forcing them =
to be identified with the locally constant coverings does not seem likely. =
At least we know that the class of unramified coverings in C is stable unde=
r pullbacks and has other nice properties=2C so C is a natural choice of un=
iverse. The fact that we have called "coverings" the unramified morphisms m=
ay then be misleading if coverings are to be tied up with Galois theory.=A0

>
Nevertheless=2C it is the case in topology that the notion of a covering in=
  the traditional sense has been enlarged to include branchings but not fold=
s. A branched covering of a locally connected space E (R.H. Fox 1957) =A0is=
  the spread completion of a locally constant covering on a pure open subspa=
ce U of E=2C thought off as "the complement of a knot". At least in this ca=
se it is meaningful to consider the "branched fundamental groupoid" (or "kn=
ot groupoid") of E with non-singular part U. It might be of interest to con=
sider a notion of =A0"generalized Galois theory" to encompass this notion o=
f "generalized covering morphism". Let me know what you think. Relevant dis=
cussions in topos theory can be found in (Bunge-Niefield 2000)=2C (Funk 200=
0)=2C =A0(Bunge-Lack 2003)=2C as well as in=A0(Bunge-Funk 2006=2C 2007).=A0

With best regards=2C
