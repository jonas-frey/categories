Dear All:

This is the second announcement of the workshop (sponsored by the Fields In=
stitute) entitled =93New Directions in Inverse Semigroups=94. The workshop =
aims to cover all aspects of inverse semigroups, including connections with=
  category theory and topos theory, with MV-algebras, and with operator alge=
bras. For more information, please visit:

http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~scpsg/Fields16/Fields16.NewDirections.Semigrps.html

The workshop immediately follows one on dynamical systems and operator alge=
bras, organized by the analysis group in our department. There will be sign=
ificant overlap in the themes of the two workshops, and we encourage everyo=
ne to try to attend both.

If you wish to contribute a talk or are interested in attending, please let=
  the organizers know as soon as possible. Registration is available through=
  the Fields Institute website, but can also be done in person at the beginn=
ing of the workshop. Some student support is still available, and we partic=
ularly encourage graduate students to contribute a talk.

Philip Scott and Pieter Hofstra
