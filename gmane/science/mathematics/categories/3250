	GAMES FOR LOGIC AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 2006
	GALOP II -- A FLOC 2006 WORKSHOP
	http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/galop
	Seattle, Washington, USA,
	August 10 - 22, 2006
	CALL FOR PAPERS

TOPIC

Game semantics has emerged as a successful paradigm in the field of =20
semantics of logics and programming languages. Game-semantic =20
techniques led to the development of the first syntax-independent =20
fully-abstract models for a variety of programming languages, ranging =20=

from the purely functional to languages with imperative features such =20=

as control, references or concurrency.  There are also connections =20
between game semantics and other semantic theories, including the the =20=

pi-calculus and domain theory. In addition to semantic analysis, an =20
algorithmic approach to game semantics has recently been developed, =20
with a view to applications in computer assisted verification and =20
program analysis.

SUBMISSIONS

* Submission: May 19
* Notification: June 9

This is intended to be an informal workshop. Participants are =20
encouraged to present work in progress, overviews of more extensive =20
work, and programmatic/position papers, as well as completed =20
projects. We therefore ask for submission both of short abstracts =20
outlining what will be presented at the workshop and of longer papers =20=

describing completed work, either published or unpublished, in the =20
following areas:

	* Game theory and interaction models in semantics
	* Games-based design and verification
	* Logics for games and games for logics
	* Algorithmic aspects of games

To submit please follow the EasyChair link http://www.easychair.org/=20
GALOP2/.

A special journal issue associated with the workshop is being =20
considered; this will be discussed at the workshop.
