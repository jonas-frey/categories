No, I don't think it's a mirage, though [help me somebody I need a good pun
here] the answer I have in mind may involve some altered states of perception.

For the moment I want to steer clear of the "computational" question,
as I haven't begun work on that, and would like to read his "current
widely used systems" to refer to set theory, elementary toposes,
Martin-Lof type theory and so on.

That being said, I wonder whether the discussion and results in my
	"Abstract Stone Duality"
paper (that I advertised on "categories" in the new year and which
has since been revised) might appeal to Ronnie.

It bases "set theory" on topology and not vice versa.

It identifies categories of open discrete and compact Hausdorff spaces
that are both pretoposes, and therefore suitable for doing algebra in,
though the open discrete spaces are more appropriate for this as they
admit free algebras.

I do, as I said, have a computational model in mind, but am not yet in
a position to say anything about it.
