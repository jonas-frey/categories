annual meeting of the European Association for Theoretical Computer
Science (EATCS). ICALP 2020 will be hosted at Peking University, in
co-location with LICS 2020 (ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer
Science).


Invited speakers:
Track A: Virginia Vassilevska (MIT), Robert Krauthgamer (Weizmann)
Track B: Stefan Kiefer (Oxford)
Joint ICALP-LICS: Andrew Yao (Tsinghua), J=C3=A9r=C3=B4me Leroux (Bordeau=

Reputation in Network, Network Models for Distributed Computing, Network
Economics and Incentive-Based Computing Related to Networks, Network
Mining and Analysis, Parallel, Distributed and External Memory
Computing, Quantum Computing, Randomness in Computation, Theory of
Security in Networks

Track B -- Algebraic and Categorical Models, Automata, Games, and Formal
Languages, Emerging and Non-standard Models of Computation, Databases,
Semi-Structured Data and Finite Model Theory, Formal and Logical Aspects
of Learning, Logic in Computer Science, Theorem Proving and Model
Checking, Models of Concurrent, Distributed, and Mobile Systems, Models
of Reactive, Hybrid and Stochastic Systems, Principles and Semantics of
Programming Languages, Program Analysis and Transformation,
Specification, Verification and Synthesis, Type Systems and Theory,
Typed Calculi
