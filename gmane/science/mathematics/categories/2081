	      BRICS - Basic Research in Computer Science

	 at the Universities of  Aarhus  and Aalborg, Denmark

This is a call for applications for:

    PhD admission and PhD grants, and
    Marie Curie Training Site Fellowships.


BRICS, Basic  Research in  Computer Science, is  funded by  the Danish
National  Research  Foundation.   It  comprises an  International  PhD
School with an associated Research Laboratory.

BRICS  is  based  on  a  commitment to  develop  theoretical  computer
science, covering core areas such as:

  - Semantics of Computation,
  - Logic,
  - Algorithms and Data Structures,
  - Complexity Theory,
  - Data Security and Cryptology, and
  - Verification,

as well as a number of spin-off activities including

  - Web Technology,
  - Quantum Informatics,
  - Bio Informatics, and
  - Networks and Distributed Real-Time Systems.

BRICS  has a  number  of  new PhD  grants  and fellowships  available,
starting in 2003. Applications can be submitted at any time.  However,
the  application  deadline for  PhD  grants  starting  August 2003  is
February 15, 2003.

PhD admission and grants:
  Any student with at least four years of studies in computer science is
  eligible to apply for PhD admission and grants.

Marie Curie Fellowships:
  These  fellowships  are  offered  within Interactive  Computation  -
  Methodology, Security, and Efficiency - and are open to PhD students
  who are nationals of a member  state of the European Community or an
  associated state, and  who wish to spend time  (from three months to
  twelve months) at BRICS, as part of their PhD studies.

Further information,  including instructions on  how to apply,  can be
found at:

You are also welcome to contact one of the BRICS directors:

  - Mogens Nielsen, Aarhus, mn@brics.dk
  - Kim G. Larsen, Aalborg, kgl@brics.dk

Kindly  forward  this  information  to  interested  students  at  your
university or research institute.

Thank you very much.
