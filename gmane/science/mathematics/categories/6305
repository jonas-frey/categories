Dear Eduardo=2C
Topological spaces or toposes=2C it is the same question. A space is locall=
y connected iff its topos of sheaaves is locally connected.=A0
In my view=2C the question of whether the notion of a covering space is a s=
tructure or a property depends on the definition of covering space that one=
  adopts.=A0
If the definition is made for arbitrary spaces (as in Spanier=2C whom you q=
uote)=2C where a continuous map p from X to B is said to be a covering proj=
ection if each point of X has an open neighborhood U evenly covered by p=2C=
  then covering space is a structure=2C no matter what the nature of the bas=
e space is. =A0It so happens that=2C in the case of a locally connected spa=
ce B=2C an alternative definition of a covering space can be given (as in R=
. Brown=2C Topology and groupoids) that refers directly to canonical neighb=
orhoods of points of X (U open=2C connected=2C and each connected component=
  of the inverse image of U under p in X is mapped homeomorphically onto U) =
and=2C with this definition=2C covering space is indeed a property. =A0
So=2C in the locally connected case=2C the structure of covering space can =
be equivalently replaced by a property - but I believe that it is still a s=
tructure before those canonical choices are made.=A0Can a structure be equi=
valent to a property=2C =A0yet not be a property? =A0
This is all I meant. I was not disputing a well known fact about covering s=
paces of locally connected spaces (or of toposes=2C for that matter).
Best regards=2CMarta
