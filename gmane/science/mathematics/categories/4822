It is not entirely clear what the PBW theorem is supposed to say over an
arbitrary ring.  Cartan-Eilenberg prove that if g is a K-free Lie algebra
(K is an arbitrary ring with 1), then the enveloping algebra is K-free and
on the same sort of basis as when K is a field (assume the basis is
ordered, then you can take the set of increasing sequences as the basis of
g^e).  Although they don't, it is simple to show that if g is
K-projective, so is g^e, although the idea of a basis is no longer
meaningful.  If g is an arbitrary K-Lie algebra, then I have no idea what
a PBW theorem could say.
