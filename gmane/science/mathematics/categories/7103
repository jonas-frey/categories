(A) What's wrong with metaphors? In Chapter 24 of his book "Metamagical
Themas", which has some excellent chapters on analogical reasoning,
Douglas Hofstadter says:
    Don't press an analogy too far, because it will always break down. In
    that case, what good are analogies? Why bother with them? What is the
    purpose of trying to establish a mapping between two things that do
    not map onto each other in reality? The answer is surely very complex,
    but the heart of it must be that it is good for our survival (or our
    genes' survival), because we do it all the time. Analogy and reminding,
    whether they are accurate or not, guide all our thought patterns.
    Being attuned to vague resemblances is the hallmark of intelligence,
    for better or for worse.

(B) What's wrong with joking? Jokes are metaphors, so by (A), they're the
hallmark of intelligence. Besides, in my country, joking is the default
technique for talking about reality. We'd be lost without it.

It's confusing if you grew up as a chemist, which I did. A bipolar object
has two ends with opposite properties. For example, detergent molecules
are bipolar. One end is hydrophilic and loves the water. The other end is
hydrophobic and loves olive oil and bacon grease. If you're lucky, it
loves them so strongly that it will wrench them away from your dirty
dishes. So to me, a bipolar object has ends, and a difference
therebetween; and therefore, it has length. Categorical objects don't.
