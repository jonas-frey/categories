I have just posted a minor upgrade of diagxy.  At the suggestion of a
graduate student at Kent State named Gerd Zeibig, I have added a new
feature that allows to identify nodes of a diagram with short identifiers
and then draw arrows between those nodes.  He had implemented this and
asked me what I thought.  I found a simpler way than he (he had defined
over 100 new counters and the number of counters that tex allows is 256,
so they are considered a rare commodity; my code uses only 2 new
counters).  This kind of reintroduces the matrix mode except with absolute
positioning of the vertices.  The results are found, as usual, in
ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr/diagxy.zip.
