The "curious discovery" is Exercise 6 at the end of Chapter VIII ("Abelian
Categories") of Mac Lane's "Categories for the Working Mathematician"...

However, I think it is an interesting question, and:

When for the standard snake lemma Michael says "...there is an exact
sequence
0 --> ker f --> ker g --> ker h --> cok f --> cok g --> cok h --> 0", what
does "there is" mean?

There are two well known answers:

ANSWER 1.  ker f --> ker g --> ker h   and   cok f --> cok g --> cok h are
the obvious induced morphisms and there exists a "connecting morphism" d :
ker h ---> cok f making the sequence above exact. Such a d is not unique:
for instance if d is such, then so is -d. However, since the snake lemma
holds in functor categories, the unnaturality of d does not make big
problems in concrete situations.

ANSWER 2. ker f --> ker g --> ker h   and   cok f --> cok g --> cok h are
the obvious induced morphisms as before, while THE "connecting morphism" d :
ker h ---> ker f is the composite of the zigzag

ker h ---> C <--- B ---> B' <---A' ---> cok f

(where the arrows are considered as internal relations). This "canonical
connecting morphism" d works even in the non-abelian case of Dominique Bourn
as I learned from my daughter Tamar who developed the "relative version".
Note also, that the desire to have such a canonical d (in the abelian case)
was a big original reason for developing what we call today "calculus of
relations" (at the beginning with great participation of Saunders himself).

And... in the "curious case = Exercise 6" the "canonical d" does not work!
For, consider the simplest case of the composite 0 ---> B ---> 0: the exact
ker-cok sequence will become

0 --> 0 --> 0 --> B --> B --> 0 --> 0 --> 0,

where B --> B must be an isomorphism, while it is easy to check that the
"canonical d" will become the relation opposite to the zero morphism B -->
B.

A possible conclusion is that the "master theorem" should involve some kind
of "d" as an extra structure.

To Steve's message: does Enrico really generalize the standard snake lemma
and the "curious case" simultaneously?
