Does one get any known versions of reals by performing the Cauchy or
Dedekind construction starting with initial algebras I for non-decidable
lifts L
instead of the NNO? It would be then also natural to interpret Cauchy
sequences and completeness using appropriate I-indexed families, of course.

Even for "integers" Z one has at least three different options:
taking I^op+1+I, taking the colimit of I->LI->LLI->..., each map being
the unit, or taking the colimit of the corresponding I-indexed diagram.
It would be strange if these turn out to be isomorphic. Is any of them an
initial
algebra for some simple functor?

Similarly there are various possibilities for rationals - taking fractions,
i.e. a quotient
of ZxZ, or colimit of all multiplication maps Z->Z, or of the corresponding
Z-indexed
diagram.

Actually I have not followed the ongoing research for a while, so maybe my
questions
are outdated. I would be grateful for any references to related work.
